00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.440
<v 0>Previously on startup.</v>

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.540
I started a company called [inaudible], which is a platform to share 6.1 second 

3
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:03.540
would have been videos. I have a rich nemesis called Aria who embarrassed me in 

4
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:03.540
a game of chess. I started to work on not fine. And then suddenly Aria launched

5
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.373
unrefined before us allowing people to share 5.9 second videos.

6
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.003
<v 1>Boy.</v>

7
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.443
<v 2>You got to launch today.</v>

8
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.640
We've got to make sure we launch before we might realize.

9
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.840
<v 1>Wait, who is this?</v>

10
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.340
Somebody told me they give this to you guys.

11
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.320
Thank you for applying to the university of Waterloo.

12
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.860
BRB. Is this?

13
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.970
<v 2>Yup. Where are you? I'm on PTO. Chillin in LA PTO.</v>

14
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.010
We don't have any PTO stops. Don't have videos.

15
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.030
I can't afford that on your contract. You said unlimited PTO, all startups data.

16
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.790
We don't actually have PTLs would just say that. And also,

17
00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:13.670
who was this person in my living room. Oh, that's Genevieve.

18
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.640
She's my substitute for the day. What? Substitute.

19
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.810
You're not a great school teacher.

20
00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:21.140
You can't just have substitutes in the middle of a launch and your Ellie,

21
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.640
Ellie need you.

22
00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:25.870
You can't just bring some random 18 year old developed a substitute.

23
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.070
Hi, uh, you must be Genevieve. You know, we're very happy to have you here.

24
00:01:37.071 --> 00:01:37.904
And uh, yeah.

25
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.053
<v 1>[Inaudible]</v>

26
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:01.813
tabs or spaces.

27
00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.520
<v 2>Tom's my vent. Turns them into four spaces,</v>

28
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.730
react or angular react hands down

29
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.970
Macintosh or of course Mac or granny Smith.

30
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.730
<v 1>Uh.</v>

31
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.600
<v 2>Then I guess granny Smith, honey crisp apples are the only Apple machines.</v>

32
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.760
I didn't know it was it anyways?

33
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.070
What's your expertise? Well,

34
00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:31.550
I'm a data engineer by trade so I can set up your whole data infrastructure from

35
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:34.820
logging to warehousing. And how would you do that? Well,

36
00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:38.840
first I develop a custom logging agent that delivers all of that logs to capita,

37
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.070
delivering both into S3 for long-term cold storage and Redshift.

38
00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:46.880
So drummer can use SQL to pull his data since he doesn't actually know how to

39
00:02:46.881 --> 00:02:50.660
code. I know I'm a cold. Sure. Uh, then to scale,

40
00:02:50.661 --> 00:02:52.550
we'll have to store these data on clusters.

41
00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:55.430
So I'll use spark to run all the jobs we need,

42
00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.250
but I doubt we'll need that since you guys have no users, but we will.

43
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.110
I mean, we are deleting 6.1 second. Flipping video.

44
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.383
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

45
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.040
<v 2>All right team.</v>

46
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.560
So it's important to let our new members feel like part of the team.

47
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.460
So we're going to do a quick ice breaker, two truths and one lie.

48
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.530
So who wants to go first? Okay, let's go. Uh,

49
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.940
I, uh, I got this. So, um, first one, two plus two equals four.

50
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.750
Oh my God is Waterloo is even Harvard

51
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.820
and Microsoft is a reputable tech company.

52
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.840
All right. Cool. Awesome. Okay. So yeah.

53
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.030
Um, my super hot girlfriend,

54
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.910
one university metal before she got hired at Google,

55
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.470
she's a part-time model and she's the one who came up with Teslas before Elon

56
00:03:58.471 --> 00:04:01.080
Musk, but lost it because of a patent lawsuit.

57
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.780
<v 1>So.</v>

58
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.010
<v 2>As a CEO of the company, you know, my job isn't to be the best at everything.</v>

59
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.290
I mean, even though I probably am my job as a CEO is to empower all my

60
00:04:13.291 --> 00:04:15.930
employees to reach their maximum potential.

61
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.460
And you know how synergy two plus two equals five

62
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.530
and you know how we get synergy pair programming. Okay. Go last question

63
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.940
on that one. No, not that one. Yeah. Great news RD.

64
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.480
No, that's not how you spell it. It's you

65
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.910
again? Let me just do it. Honestly.

66
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.970
John code is pretty terrible. I don't know what they taught them in Microsoft,

67
00:04:50.971 --> 00:04:54.240
but it clearly isn't working. I'm pretty much at God at coding. You know,

68
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.010
I write high performance code.

69
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.970
That's why I always leave only one character for my bearable names so that,

70
00:04:59.971 --> 00:05:01.530
you know, the compiler reads it faster.

71
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.780
<v 1>Joan was code is unreadable.</v>

72
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.280
<v 2>Are you done with the database migration? Nah, I'll get to that.</v>

73
00:05:14.281 --> 00:05:17.790
After I finished this thing, I kind of need it. I'm black by it.

74
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.020
What is this thing that you're finishing?

75
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.770
I'm reading this privacy policy thing that Microsoft sent me.

76
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.330
It looks really important. Oh, another one, huh? I guess I'll read that one.

77
00:05:27.331 --> 00:05:28.164
Next.

78
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.910
<v 1>John is very diligent.</v>

79
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.260
<v 2>Man. I hate merge conflicts.</v>

80
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.720
Like I never know what to do with them so complicated,

81
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.980
but I recently learned something on the kid that if you type this command,

82
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.610
it just fixes everything for you and pushes your code. It's amazing.

83
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.160
So what do you think about Genevieve? Oh, she's cool. I guess. I mean, yeah,

84
00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.990
she's not as pretty as my really hot girlfriend,

85
00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.780
but I think she can have some potential distributors out who the real boss is

86
00:06:22.781 --> 00:06:27.040
here. So you finished that data migration yet?

87
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.460
Um, it's still migrating.

88
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:39.603
So what are we doing?

89
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.730
I recently read a book for pickup artists called the game and I've been doing

90
00:06:42.731 --> 00:06:44.710
rejection challenges to build up my confidence.

91
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.870
I tried nuggets on me and didn't really get me anywhere.

92
00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.670
So I'm trying to assert dominance in the workplace,

93
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.760
sir. Are you like in a college or something?

94
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.220
<v 1>No, I dropped out after my first semester.</v>

95
00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.010
It wasn't really worth it now I just do freelance stuff.

96
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.160
<v 2>Oh yeah. I, I feel, yeah, I never went to college either.</v>

97
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.490
I applied to Harvard and they said I was a little bit too experienced. You know,

98
00:07:06.491 --> 00:07:08.620
my girlfriends dated a lot of coders in the past,

99
00:07:08.621 --> 00:07:11.740
but she says I've got the sexiest helper functions that she's ever seen.

100
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.970
I do some contract work too. You know, Airbnb, Uber,

101
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.800
you might've heard of them.

102
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.320
I got paid a million dollars each to scale their architecture.

103
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.000
<v 1>Oh yeah. That's cool. Of course. I know. You're a BNB. Send me an I,</v>

104
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.560
our first company got acquired by them.

105
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:31.570
<v 2>No. What was your startup?</v>

106
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.350
<v 1>Oh, it was really nothing. Just some big data analytics platform.</v>

107
00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:40.300
It was really just for fun, you know, for 30 mil.

108
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:41.403
Oh mother.

109
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:45.880
<v 2>Finally. Oh, you fixed the bug? No, I meant finally,</v>

110
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.990
this girl finally messaged me back. You'll check her out. Is she pretty?

111
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:55.510
Wow. Wait, why does she think you're gay?

112
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.530
Wait the helmet. Don't we? My messages, by the way,

113
00:07:59.531 --> 00:08:02.320
are you done with the data migration yet? Okay.

114
00:08:02.321 --> 00:08:04.990
So they keep talking about this data migration thing.

115
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:10.930
I don't know what a data migration is and it's kind of too late to ask

116
00:08:10.931 --> 00:08:13.960
now, do you know what a data migration is?

117
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.850
<v 1>Are you on Tinder? No, no, no, no. That's not mine.</v>

118
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.870
<v 2>I have a girlfriend. I swear. It's not mine. I don't know what that is.</v>

119
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.600
Wow. We did it. Good job guys. Good job. Nice.

120
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:41.020
Alright. Yeah, let's launch it.

121
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:49.360
Cool. Can you also put the dashboard? All right.

122
00:08:49.361 --> 00:08:51.070
All we gotta do now is your users.

123
00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:56.763
[inaudible].

124
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:24.020
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

125
00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.080
<v 2>What's popping guys. Thank you so much for watching this episode.</v>

126
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:30.620
I hope you enjoyed it. If you did. Don't forget to like and subscribe.

127
00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:34.610
I know it's been like two months as an episode, but I'm back at it.

128
00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.760
So every month we will post another new start-up episode.

129
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:42.020
The next one will be on July 1st. Now I have an announcement to make,

130
00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.870
we have new merge. Let me show you a couple.

131
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:50.270
So this one is a very, very comfortable sweatshirt a year.

132
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.830
And then also like the American apparel stamp of hoodie.

133
00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:56.493
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

134
00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.670
<v 2>And then of course, if you want to show some cleavage,</v>

135
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:06.740
we got a v-neck t-shirt a year, so yeah.

136
00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.340
Yeah. So all of these will be available on Java swiped.com.

137
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.430
Right when I post this video. So yeah, don't forget to check it out.

138
00:10:13.431 --> 00:10:15.140
It's pretty dope. Uh, yeah,

139
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.690
if you want to represent online or support my channel,

140
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.900
then definitely get one of these apparels. So yeah. Thank you so much.

141
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:29.300
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>
