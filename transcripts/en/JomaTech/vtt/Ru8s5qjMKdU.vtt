00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.440
<v 0>What's popping now, as you can see, I'm wearing some warrior swag,</v>

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.400
cause you know, I love baseball. What can I say? And you know, Steph Curry,

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.830
she's great. She's amazing. Today.

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.280
We're going to be talking about LinkedIn and I'm going to be talking about how

5
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:18.090
to get an internship at LinkedIn as a software engineer. Now,

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.180
before you watched this video, I think you should watch the first one.

7
00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:22.350
And the second one that I made,

8
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.480
because I talk about how I got my first internship.

9
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.570
And then I talk about how I got my internship at Citadel,

10
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.630
which actually kind of feeds into how I got this internship,

11
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.960
because with that experience. All right. So without further ado.

12
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.113
<v 1>Here we go.</v>

13
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.850
<v 0>Now, before we talk about how I got into chill,</v>

14
00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:45.380
let me just talk to you about the benefits.

15
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.603
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.880
<v 0>When I interned there,</v>

17
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.070
the salary was $45 an hour or $7,800

18
00:00:55.071 --> 00:00:59.990
a month. So it was the same as Citadel, but the housing was less good.

19
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.800
So this time we had to share a two bedroom apartment with four people.

20
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.630
So it was two people in one room. Now at first I thought that was like, kind of,

21
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.490
but I mean, soon I realized like, because of that, we were a lot closer.

22
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.870
So like always, you know, like every other big company there's free breakfast,

23
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.560
free lunch and free dinner, you know, their breakfast was bomb. Honestly.

24
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.030
I think out of all my internships,

25
00:01:23.031 --> 00:01:26.420
their breakfast was the best because you get smoked salmon every day.

26
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.650
Not like other companies that sometimes they either don't have smoked salmon or

27
00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:34.430
they only have smoked salmon, Fridays, Facebook. And of course I have a gym,

28
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.750
but that's a given. All right. So now that you know, that's a pretty dope job.

29
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.180
Let me tell you how I got it or how you can get it.

30
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.490
So let's just look at my resume real quick. All right. So here's my resume now,

31
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.810
as you can see, the work experience has been updated from last time.

32
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.380
This time I have two jobs, I have Citadel and Scotia bank.

33
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.830
Now for the Citadel one, I want to talk about, you know,

34
00:01:57.831 --> 00:02:00.590
my C plus plus experiences, you know,

35
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.690
talking about writing high-performance mode, threaded web socket server. He has.

36
00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:07.010
So you got to add these kind of keywords because you know,

37
00:02:07.011 --> 00:02:09.770
honestly the recruiters, they just, you know,

38
00:02:09.771 --> 00:02:14.390
look for keywords and see if you look technical or not because they are the

39
00:02:14.391 --> 00:02:17.030
ones that are going to do a first pass on your resume.

40
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.390
And if you can't pass them, then you're not going to get an interview.

41
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.510
And sometimes not going to lie, you're not going to read everything.

42
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.580
They're just going to be scanning for keywords.

43
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.320
So make sure you add as much jargon as possible, but also, you know,

44
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.980
be truthful. So yeah, so under projects, I didn't add that much,

45
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.090
but I did do extra things like, uh, did a lot of web projects. Uh,

46
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.650
I actually did also a hacked in North competition where I won,

47
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.450
to be honest, I don't think that really matters.

48
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.340
I don't think they even check that date,

49
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.420
mostly cared about my Citadel experience theater stuff or just bonus.

50
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.670
Oh my God. And I just remembered when I was at Citadel. Um,

51
00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.170
I actually learned a lot because I also did a lot of side projects. Um,

52
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.190
maybe not a lot of side projects. I did one side project and it was actually a,

53
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.420
um, adult video streaming site.

54
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.620
And you don't ask me why I wanted to do that. Okay, fine.

55
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:15.580
You can ask me it's because I thought there was a lot of potential in that

56
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:16.414
market.

57
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.860
And I thought it was the best way to penetrate it using a very good tech,

58
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.010
but I did learn a lot from building those projects. Like for example,

59
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:26.710
I learned full-stack development. I learned about, you know,

60
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.940
how to use AWS ether, easy to S3 storage, CDNs,

61
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.930
like the whole stack to make a video streaming site. And it was pretty fast,

62
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.590
but I realized it was kind of costly. So then I decided to shut it down.

63
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.240
So yeah. So using that resume,

64
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.730
I applied everywhere and then I started interviewing,

65
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.980
let me just show you like a quick snapshot of all of the jobs

66
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.230
that I got offered. So, so I, once again, I got 10 interviews,

67
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.190
it seems like every term I just get 10 interviews, but, and then I get about,

68
00:03:57.191 --> 00:04:01.420
let's see one, two, three, four, five, five offers and one ranked. Yeah.

69
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:06.400
So I got rejected by, you know, Amazon, Google, Microsoft really?

70
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.511
Oh,

71
00:04:07.511 --> 00:04:12.220
this is for embedded software engineering and then Palintir technology not going

72
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.730
to lie. LinkedIn was not my first choice. Um, you know,

73
00:04:15.731 --> 00:04:19.960
I would rather go to Google or Palentier, you know, then LinkedIn,

74
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.820
but you know, say levy. So yeah, as you can see 40 offers,

75
00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:28.810
I had Coursera as a software engineer, infrastructure, LinkedIn,

76
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.040
Microsoft as a software engineer, Tinder, Yelp,

77
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.610
and I was ranked for Yext. So that was pretty funny.

78
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.930
There's a funny story about Tinder. I'm not sure if I should get into it,

79
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.680
but if ever if I ever edited this out, I'll just put it in D a patron page.

80
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.640
All right. So let's talk about the interview process for LinkedIn. So,

81
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.270
because I went to Waterloo and I was in the job mind system,

82
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:56.710
it was a lot easier.

83
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.240
All I had to do was to on-site interview and the people came to campus for that.

84
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.740
You would do one interview and then you would have a dinner together with all

85
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:09.660
the candidates. And then the day after, if you pass the first interview,

86
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.250
you're going to get the second interview. So let's talk about a first interview.

87
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.200
So the first interview,

88
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:19.180
my question was given a set of non negative integers and a

89
00:05:19.181 --> 00:05:19.660
value.

90
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.520
Some determine if there is a subset of the given set who have some equal to

91
00:05:24.521 --> 00:05:29.260
given some, for example, you have a set three 34,

92
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.210
four 12 five two,

93
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.440
and then the sum that they want is nine and a waiter output would be,

94
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.770
would be true. And then that subset would be four and five,

95
00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:43.390
because if you add them together, you get nine. So easy dynamic programming.

96
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.930
So simple. I mean, if you want to solve it, you know, you could just,

97
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.020
you could just tell me what the answer is on a comment. I'll just pin it.

98
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.970
And yeah, there we go. I mean,

99
00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:54.220
you could probably just Google it and find and figure that out.

100
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.560
I'm not gonna lie. I hadn't memorized.

101
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.270
Like I already knew about that problem before he asked me and I just pretended I

102
00:06:00.271 --> 00:06:03.440
didn't know. I was like, Oh, what should I use?

103
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:06.500
And then first I used the recursive version because that's like the naive

104
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:09.530
version. And now I'm like, wait a minute. I could do it faster.

105
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.860
And then I did the dynamic programming version, but yeah,

106
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.730
it was all rehearsed for me. So it was great. Now the second interview,

107
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.790
the second interview was less of a coding interview.

108
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:24.500
It's more of an infrastructure and I think it depends what you specialize in

109
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.500
and then they would give you different interviews depending on that.

110
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.240
So let me tell you what a question is.

111
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.570
Basically the question asks you to design a fast key value store and it needs to

112
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.320
be support the function, get and put just like all key value stores. Okay.

113
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.520
And all the keys would fit in memory, but the valleys would be too large.

114
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:47.050
So you can't fit the whole thing, your whole key value store in memory.

115
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.780
Cause that would be too big. And you have two primitives,

116
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.470
you have a memory lookup structure. So kind of like a hash table.

117
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.160
And then also an append only file system.

118
00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.270
Basically the whole point of this question is for you to think of a creative way

119
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.900
to use the memory hash map and the file system,

120
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.170
to be able to implement this key value store. In essence,

121
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.130
what you have to do is you have to put the keys in the memory hash map,

122
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:17.200
and then the values of the memory hash map would actually be the file number

123
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.620
and the offset. And then the actual value,

124
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.730
you can append that into a file. And then you use the value of the hash map,

125
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.080
which is the offset and the file number to actually get the real value in your

126
00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:30.250
file system. Now,

127
00:07:30.251 --> 00:07:34.180
the main constraint in this question is that in the file system,

128
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.840
it's append only. So when you write to a file, you can only append to it.

129
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.130
That means you cannot do random brights, but you could do random reads,

130
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.250
meaning you could choose an offset and then just read that value.

131
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.980
But you can't do that with, right. So that's the question.

132
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:52.690
I'm not going to go over it. Um, if I do, or if people really want the answer,

133
00:07:52.691 --> 00:07:54.910
I'll just put it on my patron page. All right.

134
00:07:54.911 --> 00:07:57.310
So now I'm going to talk about how it was working there.

135
00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.650
Now let's talk about the work first. Uh,

136
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.290
let me just tell you that it was pretty chill.

137
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.430
I would come in at like 11:00 AM and then leave at like maybe

138
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.620
6:00 PM. Not even,

139
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:13.870
there's not as much pressure at LinkedIn then for example, Facebook or Citadel.

140
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.660
So what I did when I was there, I was on the graph team.

141
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:21.220
We wanted to make a whole new in memory graph database. So it was a lot faster.

142
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.590
Now what that graph database is supposed to do.

143
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.700
It's supposed to be the backend of all the queries that you do on LinkedIn.

144
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.760
So for example, uh, Facebook does it well,

145
00:08:30.761 --> 00:08:35.260
but basically what we wanted to do is that we want to allow users to be able to

146
00:08:35.261 --> 00:08:39.040
type queries, like friends of friends who never worked at Microsoft,

147
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:43.480
but worked at Facebook. So this was like a new project written from scratch.

148
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:47.260
And then the thing is the whole code base was in C plus plus.

149
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:52.120
So usually LinkedIn is like a Java shop, but just for this project,

150
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.120
it was in C plus plus because it's a high-performance language.

151
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.560
We could do a lot more low-level things, a lot easier. So it's pretty cool.

152
00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:01.440
I did learn a lot about databases and, you know,

153
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.580
because we had to write everything from scratch, like, um, query optimizers,

154
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.940
you know, the query engine query persistence and stuff like that.

155
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.770
I worked on something very little,

156
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:15.960
which was query persistence is just using the graph database to persists all

157
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:20.490
the queries. And I don't remember clearly why I had to do that.

158
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.850
I remember there was a reason, but I kind of forgot, but, um,

159
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.260
but in the end they just scrapped it, uh, to be honest, like all,

160
00:09:26.261 --> 00:09:30.300
all of my effort, it was, uh, it was pretty useless. So I got a return offer.

161
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:34.800
I was pretty happy about that. Unfortunately I did not return. And, um,

162
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:39.690
what I liked the most was more the social side of LinkedIn. So during my term,

163
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:40.550
it was, uh,

164
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:44.670
it was winter term and all of the interns came from university of Waterloo.

165
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:46.770
We were nine interns. Uh,

166
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.420
eight of us stayed in two apartments and there were next to each other.

167
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.360
So we would hang out all the time. It was so fun.

168
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.060
We would play Avalon like almost every night.

169
00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.000
And it was a good bonding experience. And like, yeah,

170
00:10:00.001 --> 00:10:03.930
it was the best internship because I built like long lasting friends and I still

171
00:10:03.931 --> 00:10:07.620
talk to some of them now. And, uh, yeah, I really appreciate that.

172
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.890
And I even made like, um, kind of like a souvenir video,

173
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:14.250
it's kind of like a collage of what we did. I mean, I, I guess,

174
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:16.320
I guess I could show you a few clips.

175
00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:21.973
Uh,

176
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.820
it's pretty funny. Cause, cause in some ways that's kind of what,

177
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:37.070
what made me start making videos, you know, after making this collage,

178
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.580
I kind of just made more and more videos made more, more collages.

179
00:10:40.581 --> 00:10:45.380
And then in the end, like this is where I am now. I make videos for you guys.

180
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:49.250
Let's see, I remember this video is really cheesy.

181
00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.030
Let me skip to that part.

182
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.033
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

183
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:56.653
<v 0>I realized,</v>

184
00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:04.670
and for the first time in my life that not a single day, have I ever felt

185
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:11.510
miss the most? Oh yeah.

186
00:11:11.511 --> 00:11:13.700
And this song was so popular back then.

187
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.270
Cause fast five was a fast five and then, sorry,

188
00:11:17.271 --> 00:11:20.990
I think it was fast and furious seven just came out and uh,

189
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.830
or was it fast flying? I don't know. But basically the main actor died then.

190
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.440
Yeah. And I used this song.

191
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:35.083
<v 2>Oh shoot.</v>

192
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.850
<v 0>Yeah. So these are all my interviews.</v>

193
00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:44.570
<v 2>We've come a long way.</v>

194
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:49.640
<v 0>This was great. America hanging out there for awhile. It was real fun.</v>

195
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.160
I live with this guy, actually.

196
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.340
<v 1>I roomed with this guy. We were in the same room, but yeah,</v>

197
00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:58.990
this guy works at Snapchat now I think.

198
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:05.640
<v 0>Anyways enough of that. All right. So I think that's about it.</v>

199
00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:09.420
Um, I hope that was useful for you. I hope you know, that was enjoyable.

200
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:10.471
