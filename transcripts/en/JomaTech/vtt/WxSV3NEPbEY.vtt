1
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.670
<v 1>Wow. Such a baller, man.</v>

2
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.833
<v 0>Oh, Hey there.</v>

3
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.370
<v 1>I didn't see you there. Just working out, you know, as you know,</v>

4
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.960
I'm turning into a fitness channel,

5
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.830
but now that you're here might as well give you a tour of my apartment.

6
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.960
So this is my personal gym, as you can see, it's pretty dope. Yeah.

7
00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:54.380
This is where I get my guns. Get my pump on, but yeah,

8
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.790
let me show you some watershed. All right.

9
00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:03.020
So here is the common area. Oh, actually, wait,

10
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.960
I want to show you this. Can you pass me my keys?

11
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.390
Yeah, this is wait. How's it work.

12
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.500
I should have rehearsed this before I got it.

13
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.440
Nevermind. All right. So here's the common area. And if you remember,

14
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.190
this is where I shot the scene with Baria where he did.

15
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.710
So yeah. So you still working for Microsoft,

16
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.370
he's still working for Microsoft. I don't know if you remember that, but yeah.

17
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.130
Welcome to my crib. These are all the boats. I'm pretty rich.

18
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.440
You know, that AdSense money gave me a lot of money. Situated on a Marina.

19
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.820
The Italian architecture of this waterfront community is striking

20
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.180
community amenities includes a Marina, boardwalk,

21
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.690
a junior Olympic sized swimming pool and spa overlooking Marina.

22
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.660
We live in a three bedroom,

23
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.670
two bathroom apartment with 1,416 square feet costing

24
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.410
at around 5,000 a month.

25
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.070
Further over you have something called like one apartments.

26
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.460
Those ones are like pretty luxurious compared to this one.

27
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.630
This one's probably at the lower end, but you know me, I just, uh,

28
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.190
it's really hard to,

29
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.850
it's really hard to like pay the bills when you're just the IC three,

30
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.350
but it's okay. You know, poor life. All right. All right,

31
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.933
here we are.

32
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.190
This is my Villa and I live here with two other roommates,

33
00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:46.880
but they're not here now. So let's start with the garage.

34
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.740
<v 0>All right. Here's the, this is.</v>

35
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.230
<v 1>This is probably the part of my tour because it's pretty messy, but, uh, yeah,</v>

36
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.000
these are my snowboarding gear. As you can see, this is my snowboard,

37
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:11.650
my bindings, my boots.

38
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.210
And then I also have a $10,000 piano here that we don't use.

39
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:20.050
It's actually on the electric piano, but it's made to be like an upright piano.

40
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.610
Yeah. Uh, it's my brother's, uh, he's a rich. I'm not, that's why he,

41
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.460
he has good stuff. All right. This is my roommates.

42
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:31.480
I think he's doing some fashion thing. I don't know.

43
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.910
All right. Here's the washer, washer,

44
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:40.180
dryer washer, dryer. And then, yeah.

45
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.450
And then all the crap that we don't know where to put. We just put it here.

46
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.600
Not bad. All right. Let's go check out the living room.

47
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.290
<v 2>Oh my God. UK water bottles.</v>

48
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.920
<v 1>All right. Okay. Oh. I have to.</v>

49
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.520
<v 2>Alright, so welcome to the hallway.</v>

50
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.150
<v 1>Not our sets of stairs. [inaudible]</v>

51
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.020
all right. Right. When you come in,

52
00:04:16.021 --> 00:04:20.160
you could see all my hand water bottles. Yeah.

53
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.420
I still haven't finished them yet. All right. And now we're in the living room.

54
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.010
Usually it doesn't look like this, but we're filming today. But yeah,

55
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.260
this is my Bitmoji. If you guys recognize it, it's usually on my interviews.

56
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.030
It's pretty dope. Yeah. So we got this love seat couch.

57
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.900
Uh, and then we also have the one that is more,

58
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.630
less comfortable, but more solid couch.

59
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.280
And then if, if you notice this is the fireplace, we can turn it on.

60
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.490
This is where we shot star three, by the way. So

61
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.190
yeah, pretty dope. And then if you go on to the kitchen area,

62
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:09.803
you could see,

63
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.960
you could see a beautiful clean table. And then you also have the chess board.

64
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.520
I mean, this is where we, uh, this is where we shot star three also. Yeah,

65
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.360
you got some barstools, but it's supposed to be here,

66
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.850
but I guess we then put it here, put this back.

67
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.990
All right. So to the kitchen, it's extremely dirty. Why? Because,

68
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.890
because I'm never in the kitchen, these, so I don't even use it. So I don't,

69
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.960
I don't even know where anything is, but Ooh, lots of protein shake cups.

70
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.120
I don't use it anymore, but I might start using them plates,

71
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.020
stuff like that. Let's look at the fridge. See what I got block. Yeah.

72
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.000
So none of this is mine, but yeah. It's okay.

73
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.120
All right. Let's go to my room now.

74
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.880
I shaved before that bathroom. Yeah. Don't film too much here.

75
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.760
It's disgusting. So let's go up.

76
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.920
<v 0>Sorry.</v>

77
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.310
<v 1>Obviously I spend most of my time, my room.</v>

78
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:29.380
So this is probably the best part of the tour. See already.

79
00:06:29.381 --> 00:06:34.120
It's so fricking dope. I mean, come on, man. What else can you put as a,

80
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.690
as a poster down? Oh, it's so hot in here. Ooh.

81
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.820
Okay. Let me just turn on the heater. I usually have the heater on.

82
00:06:42.821 --> 00:06:46.090
I like it at 80 degrees. Capops playing.

83
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.300
I'm going to stop that. I don't want to get copyright shredded.

84
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.690
<v 0>But yeah. Getting a water. Let me take a break.</v>

85
00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.413
Okay.

86
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.580
<v 1>All right. Let's go.</v>

87
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:05.530
So here you can see is where I do most of my videos because I have a

88
00:07:05.531 --> 00:07:08.950
light set up. So this is usually the main light. And then this is like,

89
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.010
kind of like a fill light. And then I have a tripod here.

90
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.240
I put my camera on and then I started on, I say, what's poppin.

91
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.340
You know? And then if I go alive, I usually have this thing.

92
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.410
This is one of my best investment because we can do is,

93
00:07:26.411 --> 00:07:30.850
you can just put it here at a phone here. And then I just go live like this.

94
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.300
So easy. Yeah. This is my personal laptop.

95
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.590
I don't use it anymore aside for watching porn. But you know,

96
00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:42.730
nowadays I do everything here. I edit my videos.

97
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.090
I watch movies, you know, I work and all of that.

98
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.410
And then this is my hard drive, my hard drive to keep all the files.

99
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.920
And then this is, um, the SD card slot.

100
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.680
So basically this is like my workplace.

101
00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.640
And then also melatonin in case, you know, I can't fall asleep.

102
00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.070
So I would use this. Uh,

103
00:08:03.071 --> 00:08:07.030
this is the microphone that I use whenever I make those sit down videos.

104
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:12.490
These are all my lenses. I got kit lens. I got another kit lens.

105
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.520
I actually have two of these cameras because I love them so much.

106
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.430
They're to 87 S I'll put them all into the description below.

107
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.470
If you want to buy them, they're pretty good.

108
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.420
And then also these anal beads that keep my camera steady.

109
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:30.370
Yeah. And then here I have all my chargers, bury ports, you know,

110
00:08:30.371 --> 00:08:33.190
I charged my phone and stuff like that. It's pretty dope.

111
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:38.650
So this is the bed. All the magic happens. And by magic,

112
00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:42.970
I mean magic alone, because I can never get a girl here. You know,

113
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.840
you guys talked about this many times and yes, that is true, but,

114
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.600
but I have a backup plan. And let me show you.

115
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.613
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

116
00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:57.690
<v 1>I have a Japanese mattress that can</v>

117
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:03.120
roll over right here. There you go. Boom. Yeah,

118
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.910
if ever I bring girls over, I can't,

119
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.160
I can't put her here because there's a 200 pound limit,

120
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.700
but the floor doesn't have a 200 pound limit. So there you go.

121
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:12.990
That's another bed.

122
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.450
<v 0>Okay. Let's put this back. All right.</v>

123
00:09:20.451 --> 00:09:25.040
I'm gonna leave it here for now. Oh. God,

124
00:09:25.041 --> 00:09:25.874
this room is small.

125
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.920
<v 1>All right. Okay. What else? Oh, okay. So here you can see got my accessory.</v>

126
00:09:30.921 --> 00:09:32.990
I usually have a plate and a fork here,

127
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:37.850
cause I don't want to be liable for anything in the kitchen because I only use

128
00:09:37.851 --> 00:09:42.560
one fork and one place. So they can't blame me for anything. I got my, uh,

129
00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:47.240
I got my awesome painting. It's pretty dope. I got lube.

130
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:50.600
It's mostly for myself. I got, Ooh, look at this.

131
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.640
This is a dope comic book. I haven't read it yet. Kind of dyslexic.

132
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.660
I don't want to read, but yeah, let's see. Oh, I phone. Oh, it does not.

133
00:09:59.661 --> 00:10:03.830
iPhone has a pixel, but yeah. And then in here I have utter crap.

134
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:07.820
I just store everything. Oh, all the wires because you know,

135
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.790
camera gears and all that. I have way too many wires,

136
00:10:10.791 --> 00:10:13.940
converters stuff like this. Boom.

137
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:19.880
What else? Oh, I got a lot of banana holders.

138
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:21.740
Yeah. I got a lot of banana holders.

139
00:10:21.741 --> 00:10:24.650
I never used them yet because I usually just eat the banana before I,

140
00:10:24.651 --> 00:10:29.300
even before I even like before I even carry it. So I don't need that.

141
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.040
Okay. Out.

142
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:36.860
<v 0>Holy. Okay. I think that's about it. You know,</v>

143
00:10:36.861 --> 00:10:37.694
I got art.

144
00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.810
<v 1>And then this is, this is my clean pile. This is my dirty pile.</v>

145
00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.570
That's usually what it is. Oh, I guess I'll show you my toys.

146
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.223
<v 0>So far.</v>

147
00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:59.720
All right. So here's my corgi.

148
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:05.270
<v 1>Very popular corgi, but one other toy. I don't know that I have,</v>

149
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.690
because you know, I expose it last is called Bemo.

150
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.900
It's basically like a robot bus. Yeah. It's pretty cute.

151
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.540
He used to be my favorite until I got the corgi.

152
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:19.220
<v 0>Hello? Okay. All right. Let's go back down.</v>

153
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.470
<v 1>All right. So that's, that's basically it.</v>

154
00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:35.360
So thank you for touring with me and, uh, uh, hope.

155
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.310
I hope you liked it. Uh,

156
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.330
in case you want to know this costs about $5,000 a month.

157
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.410
I paid 1,500 cause I got the smallest room and uh, yeah.

158
00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:52.160
<v 0>Oh yeah.</v>
