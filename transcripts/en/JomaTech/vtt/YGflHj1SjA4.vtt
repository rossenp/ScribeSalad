00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.080
<v 0>So Indiana, what was the TC for like snap Uber and like Google. Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.350
<v 1>So it depends on how you calculate it,</v>

3
00:00:06.351 --> 00:00:08.750
but basically around 300 K for snap and Uber,

4
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.900
and then for Google about like 240K.

5
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.750
<v 0>Was crazy before we continued as video. I just want to say,</v>

6
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.380
thank you so much for blinkers, for sponsoring this video. Nowadays,

7
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.970
people are so busy. We have full-time jobs, hobbies, friends, or like me,

8
00:00:25.971 --> 00:00:27.320
you have a YouTube channel to run.

9
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.010
So you can't just find the time to sit down and learn.

10
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.040
There is tons of knowledge you can learn from reading books,

11
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.380
but with the busy schedule, that's hard.

12
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.120
If you wish you can get the main insights from the books and apply right away to

13
00:00:41.121 --> 00:00:44.630
your life, then I really recommend the app called Blinkist.

14
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.110
Blinkist is the only app that takes the best insights.

15
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.910
Didn't need to know information from thousands of nonfiction books and convinces

16
00:00:52.911 --> 00:00:57.290
them down into just 15 minutes. So you can read it or listen to it.

17
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.060
A lot of nonfiction books tend to repeat itself or give a lot of example.

18
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.900
So that's why I like blink because it gets straight to the point and it tells

19
00:01:05.901 --> 00:01:10.130
you in 15 minutes, I use blinkers right before bed for 15 minutes,

20
00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:12.950
allowing me to absorb all that knowledge before sleeping.

21
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.060
I've read these books and I highly recommend you check out the seven habits of

22
00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:21.650
highly effective people, because everyone talks about it. And also a homo Deus,

23
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.210
which is cool because it talks about a prediction of humanity with technology.

24
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.770
Now, the first a hundred people to go on blinkus.com/joma.

25
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.340
We'll get a whole week for free, so you can try it out.

26
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.310
And also you get 25% off.

27
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.140
If you decide to go for full membership. Now these spots are going to go fast,

28
00:01:42.141 --> 00:01:45.530
but for people who get in there, I highly recommend reading those two books.

29
00:01:45.531 --> 00:01:50.240
I mentioned, which is seven habits of highly effective people and homo Deus.

30
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.750
Now remember the first seven days are completely free,

31
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.840
so you could cancel at any time. No problem.

32
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.480
All right. Thanks for coming. Cyrus, do you want to say your name first?

33
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.540
<v 1>Sure. Uh, wait, look at you. Alright.</v>

34
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.550
<v 2>[Inaudible] okay.</v>

35
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.420
<v 0>All right. Well thank you for coming Cyrus. And, um, yeah,</v>

36
00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:23.090
so let's just have like a casual conversation cause you know,

37
00:02:23.091 --> 00:02:26.330
I'm not try-hard anymore, so we can just say yes, your name,

38
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.600
like what do you do? And then just so that he could get some context. Sure.

39
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.350
<v 1>Uh I'm Cyrus. She, I just recently joined Uber. Um.</v>

40
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.283
<v 2>I'm sorry.</v>

41
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.190
<v 1>Yeah, so I met, uh, I met gentleman at Facebook. Uh,</v>

42
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.900
we are in the same team in, in July, 2017.

43
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.440
Um, and then I was there for about a year and a half, um,

44
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.070
and then went through interview prep cycle. Um, so yeah.

45
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.040
<v 0>Nice. Nice. So wait, so what college did you go to?</v>

46
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.220
<v 1>Uh, I went to a small liberal arts college in Kentucky. Uh,</v>

47
00:02:58.221 --> 00:03:01.330
I had about 1400 students called center college.

48
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.590
<v 0>Inch and 1400 students, 4,000 students total. Wait the total total. Yeah,</v>

49
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.990
like five, four years. Four years. Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah.

50
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.320
And w what does liberal arts college? I actually don't know.

51
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.090
<v 1>Uh, so basically they try to emphasize like a general education. Um,</v>

52
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.040
so trying to like produce well-rounded students. Uh, so when I was there,

53
00:03:23.041 --> 00:03:25.950
I wrote a lot of like papers. I was really a philosophy major. Um,

54
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.740
so I switched to computer science junior year. Um.

55
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:30.990
<v 0>I see, I see. Okay.</v>

56
00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:35.070
So the reason why I brought you here is because you have a very famous post on

57
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.640
CSV or questions right. On Reddit. So, yeah.

58
00:03:38.641 --> 00:03:40.200
So I'm going to put that in the description,

59
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.100
but can you kind of tell me like what that post is about?

60
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.640
<v 1>Yeah, yeah. So basically I spent a lot of time reading the subreddit, um,</v>

61
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.720
before I joined Facebook. Um, and I saw a lot of posts talking about, um,

62
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.350
people joining, you know, like Facebook, Google, um, big tech companies.

63
00:03:55.351 --> 00:03:57.130
And a lot of them had, um, you know,

64
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.240
like pretty impressive backgrounds from like Stanford, you know, U Waterloo,

65
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.560
Stanford of Canada. Um, but you know, I came from a small liberal arts college.

66
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.740
I didn't really know anybody who had gone to any of those companies. Um,

67
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.020
and so when I did eventually make it out there,

68
00:04:10.021 --> 00:04:13.990
I thought I could give back and talk about how I, yeah. Yeah.

69
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.180
<v 0>Okay. So you did have a CS degree, but it's from like a college, right.</v>

70
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.990
Pretty much. But then, and then when you came out,

71
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.350
you got what you got a job at, like, yeah.

72
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.370
<v 1>Yeah. So I graduated, uh, in the beginning of 2015 and I joined, uh,</v>

73
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.200
like a big financial company, um, still in the South. Um, and then, uh,

74
00:04:34.201 --> 00:04:36.060
then I joined a startup and then, um,

75
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.970
throughout this time I had been getting like interview calls, um,

76
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.730
for like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, but, um,

77
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.750
I just didn't really focus on studying and didn't really do well. Uh,

78
00:04:45.751 --> 00:04:49.560
and then finally I got another call from Facebook and I decided that, you know,

79
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.460
this was the moment you're going to go try hormone, try hard mode.

80
00:04:53.461 --> 00:04:58.290
I went all in and I studied like 120 hours in like a month while working full

81
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.540
time. Um, it's really grinded and just wrote a post about that experience.

82
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.980
<v 0>That's perfect because, um, I just quit my job, you know, it,</v>

83
00:05:07.981 --> 00:05:11.250
but my audience doesn't know, I just quit my job as a data scientist,

84
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.330
and now I want to go back into Sweden, you know, so, uh,

85
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.760
I've already prepared and I've interviewed a lot,

86
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.630
but I want to hear like your take, like, how did you start? Like, okay.

87
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.560
You know, you have your full-time job still,

88
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.840
do you quit or no use to just study on the side? Would it.

89
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.560
<v 1>Yeah, I think ideally you don't quit because, you know, it's really risky. Um,</v>

90
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.630
but it, it does depend.

91
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.950
I have a friend who successfully quit her job and studied full time. Uh,

92
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.270
and she was actually, you know, Austin, North Carolina, um, and made it out to,

93
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.120
uh, Silicon Silicon Valley. But, um,

94
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.030
so I think the benefit of quitting is that it's kind of like,

95
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.870
you get like a forcing function, you get that desperation. Um,

96
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.260
but obviously it's a big gamble if it doesn't work out, you're kind of screwed.

97
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.150
Um, but yeah, ideally you keep your, and you study on the side. Um.

98
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.160
<v 0>So yeah. Okay. So you study on the side yeah. Study on the side both times.</v>

99
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.340
So you just went back home and then start studying.

100
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.120
<v 1>Uh, yeah. So not, yeah, pretty much every day, I guess. But basically the,</v>

101
00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:15.070
I came up with a, like a study plan and a schedule sort of a timeline. Um,

102
00:06:15.071 --> 00:06:17.830
and then one thing, uh, so I just recently another posts,

103
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.850
but one thing I talk about is that I think it really helps to have like a

104
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.100
quantifiable like goals, um,

105
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.220
just because it's so easy to become frustrated in the beginning. Um,

106
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:28.780
and it's hard to tell,

107
00:06:28.781 --> 00:06:32.050
like if you're making progress and so my goals were to study, you know,

108
00:06:32.051 --> 00:06:35.290
like a hundred hours and to do like a hundred coding problems.

109
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.840
<v 0>Oh. A hundred coding problems. Okay.</v>

110
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.100
And what did you use for these coding problems?

111
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.970
<v 1>Yeah, so I mainly use li code. Um, so li codes really trendy right now,</v>

112
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.730
but I think it gives a premium for it. Yeah, I did. I did.

113
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.810
I think it was worth it, uh, just the return on investment. Um, but yeah,

114
00:06:49.811 --> 00:06:53.350
so I did a lot of li code I think was the most efficient, uh, Webster.

115
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.140
<v 0>So before Facebook, you did Lee code?</v>

116
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.490
<v 1>Uh, I did, yeah, I did some, I did some for Facebook. I did,</v>

117
00:07:00.491 --> 00:07:04.540
I think I did about, uh, like 76%. And then this time around,

118
00:07:04.541 --> 00:07:08.470
I did like 130 heart mediums or easy, um, mostly mediums.

119
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.130
I think mediums is the best bang for your buck. Easy is, um,

120
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.230
you can cycle there a lot and really fast,

121
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.840
but you don't really like struggle that much.

122
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.120
So you don't really get that experience. And then hearts are like,

123
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.040
you struggle too much, so you don't cover it.

124
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.680
<v 0>Hmm. Okay. But your job at Facebook was as a data engineer. Yeah. Okay. Okay.</v>

125
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:27.700
What do you do now?

126
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.550
<v 1>So now I'm a software engineer, so actually I guess, similar to you,</v>

127
00:07:30.551 --> 00:07:34.630
I wanted to transfer back to being a software engineer. Um, but yeah,

128
00:07:34.631 --> 00:07:37.420
I didn't really find that transition too hard. I think, uh,

129
00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.940
interviewing the mostly want to see if like, if,

130
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.880
if you can code and if you can show that through the Kony interview,

131
00:07:42.881 --> 00:07:43.714
they don't really.

132
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.980
<v 0>Okay. So, so did an engineer, they still asked you like to code stuff? Yeah.</v>

133
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.230
Like algorithms and stuff. Okay.

134
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:54.190
So you did about 70 something questions and was that like an overkill for

135
00:07:54.191 --> 00:07:55.540
Facebook or was it.

136
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:56.591
<v 1>Uh, yeah,</v>

137
00:07:56.591 --> 00:07:59.290
so for Facebook it was a little bit overkill because that was a data engineering

138
00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:02.740
position. Um, but this time around for like Uber and Google, um,

139
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:04.300
it was about the right amount, I think.

140
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.380
<v 0>So your goal was a hundred hours, like total, total until you started.</v>

141
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.030
<v 1>The interview. Yeah. So I ended up doing about 120, but I think, uh,</v>

142
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.070
we for before Facebook, no, sorry. Before Facebook, it was, uh, I remember,

143
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:18.603
yeah, sorry.

144
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:20.463
<v 0>Video here.</v>

145
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:21.760
<v 1>Before Facebook. It was,</v>

146
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:26.290
I guess like 102 or 120 or something like that. Um,

147
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:31.210
but yeah, I, yeah, I, I tracked my time just because I feel like, um,

148
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.980
if you only track problems,

149
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:36.460
then you're like incentivize to like only do easy problems in a way like

150
00:08:36.461 --> 00:08:39.520
subconsciously. And if you only attract time, it's kind of like,

151
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:43.300
you you're incentivized to be inefficient. I spend a lot of time for problem.

152
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:44.163
Like, it doesn't really matter.

153
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.700
So that's why I got kind of like a kind of metric. Yeah, exactly.
