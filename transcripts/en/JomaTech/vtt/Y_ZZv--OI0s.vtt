00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.270
<v 0>All right. Welcome to another interview guys. Whoo.</v>

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.580
<v 1>We got Cameron today. You know,</v>

3
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.740
your least favorite character in a start-up series,

4
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.030
a top five character to start a series. Yeah. I mean, thanks for coming.

5
00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:15.810
You were definitely the cheapest to get here, so thank you so much.

6
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.950
<v 2>You're paying everyone else. All right. I don't pay.</v>

7
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.550
All right. That's a good start.

8
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.870
<v 1>First things first for people who know who watched the start-up series. Well,</v>

9
00:00:26.871 --> 00:00:30.920
first of all, if you don't watch it, you should watch it right now. Okay.

10
00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:32.180
There we go. Now,

11
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.890
the thing about Cameron in startup series is that he's a very,

12
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.800
how do we say a romantic character? You know,

13
00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:42.620
he's very passionate and stuff like that. So how are you in real life?

14
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.370
Cause like they only know you Cameron as a character, but they don't know you.

15
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.460
<v 2>Well, they, they say life imitates art.</v>

16
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.790
I think romantic is a nice term.

17
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.230
Desperate's probably a better term for the 3% of viewers who are women.

18
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.290
I am single, you know, um,

19
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.200
I think at the beginning,

20
00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:06.170
I didn't really know what my character was going to be on the start-up series.

21
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.090
And then I just came to realize like my acting's not great, but I can be myself.

22
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.960
<v 1>I think your acting is great unless that's just yourself.</v>

23
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.540
<v 2>I am a lovable dork in real life, right?</v>

24
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.380
Like when I was struggling doing pushups, I was actually trying.

25
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.840
<v 0>Push us that wasn't acting, that was reality.</v>

26
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.320
<v 1>Tell you to do like a ton. But cause we kept,</v>

27
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.630
we kept like retaking the same thing. I was excited.

28
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.510
<v 2>By the end of that, the, the heavy breaths. Those, those were real.</v>

29
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.790
There's a little bit of reality. There's a little bit of a joke.

30
00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:36.350
I think it's me to the extreme.

31
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.610
<v 1>So, so are you a programmer or something else in the startup series you are</v>

32
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.450
approved.

33
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.800
<v 2>I've written hello world in a few different languages. Um, but no,</v>

34
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.600
I am not a programmer. I'm a data scientist.

35
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.470
<v 1>Okay. So you're a data scientist. Nice. Nice. So let's talk about career now.</v>

36
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.610
Um, so as a data scientist, uh, first of all, uh.

37
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.270
<v 2>Work, uh, graduated out of UC Berkeley. Um,</v>

38
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.950
and then I worked for Tinder for a couple of years and now I am working on

39
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.600
unnamed, large tech company in the Bay. All sick.

40
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.570
<v 0>Don't wonder what that is. No idea, dude. I don't know, man.</v>

41
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.600
<v 2>They call it like head pages.</v>

42
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.670
<v 0>Pages. Yeah.</v>

43
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.110
<v 1>Yeah. I can't think of what that wonder.</v>

44
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.310
I wonder what it is, you know? So wait, so Tinder was your first job. Yeah,

45
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.800
that is crazy. Oh, interesting.

46
00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:28.790
So you might know a lot about relationships or at least dating.

47
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.500
<v 2>I'm one of those people who joined Tinder because I didn't know how to do</v>

48
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.780
relationships. So I figured like maybe I've learned, so did you learn anything?

49
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.690
Oh yeah. I learned a lot. I went on how many dates when I,

50
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.410
my first year at Tinder, I went on one day. It was bad.

51
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.600
<v 1>Well maybe you were just very selective, right? Yeah.</v>

52
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.100
<v 0>Yeah. It was right swiping constantly. Um,</v>

53
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.080
you get a lot of matches though and no none, no, no.

54
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.120
<v 2>I had to put in work to get matches, but yeah, the first year was, uh,</v>

55
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.290
it was a rough fee and then eventually I started figuring out what to and

56
00:02:59.291 --> 00:03:01.000
everything and like, you know,

57
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.620
I was going on dates one or two dates a week by like my second year at tender,

58
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:07.360
just cause I figured out what to do.

59
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.260
<v 1>Oh wow. That's actually a lot. One or two days a week. Yeah.</v>

60
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.850
<v 2>I'm a first date machine. Second day. It's not so much, you know,</v>

61
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.920
one and done kind of deal. Okay.

62
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.270
<v 1>Can I ask you more questions about that later? Because I want some tips also.</v>

63
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.700
Yeah. So you went to Berkeley and then wait,

64
00:03:23.701 --> 00:03:25.860
what did you study such that you went to data science?

65
00:03:25.861 --> 00:03:27.360
Like how do you even know about data science?

66
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.290
<v 2>Good question. Um, so I was bioengineering at Berkeley. Um,</v>

67
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.180
I was pre-med and then I took organic chemistry and realized I hated

68
00:03:36.181 --> 00:03:36.630
it. So yeah.

69
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.600
<v 1>You're supposed to be a doctor. Your parents thought you were going to be done.</v>

70
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.100
<v 2>Parents are both doctors. They want me to be a doctor, uh,</v>

71
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.660
a little bit. They, they made me take the ONCAT when I got really, yeah,

72
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.480
they didn't make it. They didn't make me study. I did not do well on it,

73
00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:54.510
but they made me take it. Cause they wanted me to change my mind.

74
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.210
They were hoping, you know, that the change in their heart of hearts yeah.

75
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.090
TV on capita was eight hours was so much fun, man. Oh God, I gotta do this more.

76
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.710
I got like Caribbean med school scores. Like what does that mean? So like,

77
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.340
MK,

78
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.240
you gotta get like 10 points above the average to get into like a good us med

79
00:04:12.241 --> 00:04:15.540
school. I got four points above the average, which is like,

80
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.180
you can get into a Caribbean med school. This is where like people go,

81
00:04:18.181 --> 00:04:20.820
if they don't get into any of us med schools, they go to the Caribbean,

82
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.220
hang out there for a few years. I did pre-med I graduated pre-med um,

83
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.540
but I knew at that point I didn't want to do do bio anymore. Um,

84
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.740
I want to do some mixture of like stats and psychology. Um,

85
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.000
so I applied to PhDs and game theory and I hadn't taken a single econ class in

86
00:04:39.001 --> 00:04:42.540
my wife. And so I got rejected from every single PhD that I applied to.

87
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.250
And so then I, I panicked a bit,

88
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.410
I applied to 115 jobs out of undergrad. Um,

89
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.420
and then it was a mixture of like analytics, product management, um,

90
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.450
and then UX research. Um, and the analytics ones,

91
00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.670
were they the only ones that really called me back cause I had the math

92
00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:02.640
background for it. So then I went into, uh, analytics.

93
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.750
<v 1>You were doing biomedical engineering. Yeah. And uh,</v>

94
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.670
and there were a lot of math in that I guess.

95
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.090
<v 2>Yeah. I mean, it's like a lot of engineering classes. I like, I like stats.</v>

96
00:05:12.091 --> 00:05:14.490
So I did a lot of stats classes on the side and everything,

97
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.420
but like the bio in itself was enough to handle any of the math that you do as a

98
00:05:18.421 --> 00:05:19.254
data.

99
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.580
<v 1>Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah.</v>

100
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.790
Cause I was wondering like what that degree do they even like look at you

101
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.100
because I feel like they would filter it, but I guess not.

102
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.610
<v 2>On my team, there's a lot of people who are like bio and physics PhDs.</v>

103
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.310
Like when I read my data science teams,

104
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.310
there's like a lot of people who came from like a bio and an engineering

105
00:05:35.311 --> 00:05:37.890
background actually there's more who do that than come from like a stats

106
00:05:37.891 --> 00:05:40.290
background or a math background.

107
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.600
<v 1>And then when you started your first shop at Tinder,</v>

108
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.350
did you enjoy it or did you not like why'd you switch?

109
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.050
<v 2>I liked it, but I was working out in Texas,</v>

110
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.740
Texas is one of those places where like, if you have a family, it's nice.

111
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.550
It's a great place to have like golden retriever to kids, white picket fence.

112
00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.110
Right. But like as a 22 year old, you can only eat so much barbecue.

113
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.380
And like I was putting on weight and I didn't really have any friends out there.

114
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.140
Um, cause I'd never lived out there. I'd always lived in California.

115
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.330
And so like, it just, it was boring.

116
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.110
Cause I tried to move back to the Bay and when I did, I was recruited.

117
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.100
<v 1>You could get really huge houses there. Right. Yeah.</v>

118
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.820
<v 2>Great cheap. Yeah. Do you get a nice house? Like $200,000 or so.</v>

119
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.630
<v 1>I think we should all move to Texas before it rises up again. I.</v>

120
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.730
<v 2>Mean a lot of companies are going to Austin at this point.</v>

121
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.270
<v 1>Okay. Well I guess the price is going to rise then. Yeah. It's going to sucks.</v>

122
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.880
So did you study for data science interview?

123
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.050
<v 2>I spent a week learning SQL just like I did.</v>

124
00:06:35.051 --> 00:06:37.870
I think w three schools, I just picked it up super quickly.

125
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.320
Also learned a lot from brilliant.org. It's B R I.

126
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.740
<v 1>They're not sponsored. It's not, we're not going to give them free sponsorships.</v>

127
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.860
<v 2>Oh, sorry. My bad. Um, to get a data science interview,</v>

128
00:06:47.861 --> 00:06:52.150
you need CQL and then you need like either R or Python and honestly that's about

129
00:06:52.151 --> 00:06:55.930
it. Like when I interviewed for, um, analytics positions, like on the third end,

130
00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.010
as the interviewer,

131
00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.250
I kept on seeing resumes that were just like packed with every programming

132
00:07:00.251 --> 00:07:03.670
language possible. And like I usually trash them cause like,

133
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.940
well the reality is that like all these people have the exact same resume.

134
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.010
Like it's literally template ID. Um,

135
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.670
and not like not the exact same word for word, but like objectively the same.

136
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.350
And then when I see a hundred of those,

137
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.680
I don't know which of the a hundred to pick. So I don't pick any of them. Uh,

138
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:18.490
the reason being like,

139
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:23.260
I look for people who have some distinct interest in the field and that gives me

140
00:07:23.261 --> 00:07:23.930
a better signal.

141
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.500
Like there's a reason they're applying to this job instead of just spamming

142
00:07:26.501 --> 00:07:28.570
their resume out to everywhere. Um.

143
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.830
<v 1>Sounds a little bit like dating. It does sound a little bit like date cause uh,</v>

144
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.040
you know, my profile is just generic so that I can apply it to most people.

145
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:39.790
Do you have a canned pickup line? No, I don't actually. I just say, Hey.

146
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:42.370
<v 2>You say, Hey and that works. No.</v>

147
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.873
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

148
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.560
<v 1>Okay. I mean, that's the thing,</v>

149
00:07:47.561 --> 00:07:50.320
like if there are girls that I don't really care about, then I say, Hey,

150
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.860
because if they say, Hey back and they talked to me, they must really like me.

151
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.580
So I'd be down if someone's re like really into me. Right.

152
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:01.300
But if it's someone that I think like, Oh my God, she's so hot. Or like, Oh,

153
00:08:01.301 --> 00:08:04.930
she's so interesting. Then I'll take more, like, I'll take the time to like,

154
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.330
look at a profile, try to think of a funny line and then do it.

155
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.350
<v 2>How many responses do you get when you say, Hey.</v>

156
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.260
<v 1>No one out of 10 is.</v>

157
00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.380
<v 2>Yeah. Oh yeah. Right when I attend, that's actually pretty.</v>

158
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.690
<v 0>Good. That's actually not bad. I.</v>

159
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.960
<v 1>Mean, I don't get along matches either. Right. So yeah.</v>

160
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.070
<v 2>You're saying that as if you have 10 matches, dude, you know.</v>

161
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:30.370
<v 0>This is an incomplete sample, small numbers,</v>

162
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.700
half a response on the fly matches. So.

163
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:39.340
<v 1>What did you learn about dating when you worked at Tinder.</v>

164
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:41.470
<v 2>So much? Um,</v>

165
00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.760
I'm going to try not talking about the math part first. Cause like,

166
00:08:45.761 --> 00:08:48.550
I think there's a lot of cool math and there's a lot of like optimization,

167
00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:53.350
but like what I learned more about was kind of the mindset of dating. Um,

168
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:54.581
and by that, I mean,

169
00:08:54.581 --> 00:08:58.140
like you can really go into dating with two different mindsets. Well,

170
00:08:58.141 --> 00:08:59.760
first off you could just not date.

171
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.030
And I know a lot of people that do that and like they're happy doing that,

172
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:06.840
but they also want to get married and they just don't know when that's going to

173
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.900
switch that little switch, going to flip and they're going to be like, wait,

174
00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:11.970
I need to start dating. So a lot people just kind of push it off.

175
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.450
That's one like failed mindset. But the one that,

176
00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.010
that a lot of people have is that like the first dates and interview and that

177
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:23.940
like, you're trying to gauge them. You're trying to be impressed by them.

178
00:09:23.941 --> 00:09:27.600
And you're also trying to impress them and it makes it really stressful.

179
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:31.500
And I was guilty of this when I started dating too, where I was like, Oh God,

180
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:34.170
I have to be like on my best form. I got to put on my nicest shirt.

181
00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:37.320
I got to like, you know, gel up my hair and all that kind of stuff. I mean,

182
00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:38.670
what y'all hair, it looks really bad by the way.

183
00:09:38.671 --> 00:09:42.390
But I eventually realized that like dating is about the process.

184
00:09:42.391 --> 00:09:44.880
Like the process itself is the part that's meant to be enjoyable.

185
00:09:44.881 --> 00:09:47.640
Just meeting people, doing things that you want to do. Anyway,

186
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.150
I started going on like fun dates instead of just getting dinner every single

187
00:09:51.151 --> 00:09:55.050
time. So like, I'd started doing like mini golf or even like laser tag,

188
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.830
like these childish, but like fun dates, like hiking, all that kind of stuff,

189
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.490
just so that you enjoy the experience and like having someone there with you

190
00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:06.300
makes it that much better. It's no large contingent on that person.

191
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.850
One of the things I learned at Tinder from like all of the research and

192
00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:12.390
interviews I did is that like the people who go into that mindset are just so

193
00:10:12.391 --> 00:10:15.090
much happier with the process. And they're a lot more successful, too.

194
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:16.483
<v 1>Interesting.</v>

195
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.900
Like I think fundamentally I'm kind of the same.

196
00:10:20.901 --> 00:10:23.150
Like I just want to have fun and stuff like that. You know,

197
00:10:23.151 --> 00:10:25.160
I'm not trying to impress them. It's not an interview,

198
00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.820
but the process is totally different versus you.

199
00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:31.760
So you're trying to have like a fun day, you know,

200
00:10:31.761 --> 00:10:35.210
like laser tag and stuff like that. I always do the same day.

201
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:40.820
What's your date? Well, Oh. What's your move. I don't know if I can say this.

202
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:45.350
Uh, because ah, it. Okay. Oh my God. So everyone on my,

203
00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.430
on my move because it's, it is the shoe. So I,

204
00:10:48.431 --> 00:10:52.760
I bring them to the unnamed company. Okay. Where we work.

205
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.790
So I bring them there. Everyone says like, that's a balance thing. It's like,

206
00:10:55.850 --> 00:11:00.260
it's not a good day or whatever. But for me it's because I want a low risk date.

207
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.300
Right. Because I don't even know if I'm gonna like you or not.

208
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.640
So why am I going to invest so much time and money into you?

209
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.850
And then because I bring them to campus it's free. Right.

210
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.480
<v 2>Was she nervous about like coworkers seeing you like going on like a random date</v>

211
00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.550
and then like the cafeteria though?

212
00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.780
<v 1>No, I don't care what you like. Like, I mean, isn't it cool for me? I'm like,</v>

213
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:18.500
Oh yeah.

214
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:22.850
<v 2>The date I'm always like so paranoid that like people will start like whispering</v>

215
00:11:22.851 --> 00:11:24.230
and muttering about or whatever.

216
00:11:24.231 --> 00:11:27.800
Like one of my nightmares is I run into a coworker while I'm on a date or

217
00:11:27.801 --> 00:11:28.634
something. Yeah.

218
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.880
<v 1>Yeah. Because I want them to talk about it. I want them to be like, Oh wow.</v>

219
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:35.750
Joel was on the day. Yay. Kind of thing. But anyways, so the thing is,

220
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.000
even before I went to unnamed large company,

221
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.010
my dates would be always the same as in like, yeah.

222
00:11:40.011 --> 00:11:44.050
It's dinner at the same place, dessert at the same place. Like it's,

223
00:11:44.051 --> 00:11:45.380
it's like rehearse kind of.

224
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.840
<v 2>Do you have rehearsed conversations too? Okay.</v>

225
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:52.400
<v 1>Rehearse conversations. No, but rehearse topics. Yes. Cause, cause they always,</v>

226
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.900
it naturally into those topics. Right. But, but the thing is,

227
00:11:55.930 --> 00:12:00.580
I'm not trying to like show that I'm really cool or it's like an interview or I

228
00:12:00.581 --> 00:12:02.000
want to get to know them. Honestly. I, I,

229
00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:03.700
I don't want to try to get to know them.

230
00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:08.580
<v 2>I just try. I'm not surprised by that.</v>

231
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.960
<v 1>In the, in a good way. Cause, cause I think, okay.</v>

232
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.990
Honestly I think my second date ratios are pretty, is pretty good.

233
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.830
And because like I just try to entertain them for the first day. I, you know,

234
00:12:19.831 --> 00:12:22.860
like my best jokes or whatever, I'm just have fun with them.

235
00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.500
So I kind of want to break the ice as soon as possible.

236
00:12:25.501 --> 00:12:26.820
And that's how I do it and yeah,

237
00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:30.270
I learned nothing about them and they usually learn nothing about me either,

238
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.330
but we just talk about really random stuff. That's funny or it's fun.

239
00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:38.070
I think the reason why it goes to the second day so often is because one

240
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:41.970
for once they don't feel like that awkward small talk or trying to force

241
00:12:41.971 --> 00:12:44.400
yourself to learn about the other person because we didn't learn about each

242
00:12:44.401 --> 00:12:47.270
other. You know, it was purely just fun. Right? Well,

243
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.350
that's how I enjoy my first days, at least.

244
00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.650
<v 2>And this is one of the things that, I mean I learned is that, you know,</v>

245
00:12:52.651 --> 00:12:56.610
the first date, you, you check off the boxes for the other person somewhat.

246
00:12:56.611 --> 00:13:00.180
So like you don't necessarily ask them about their deepest personal secrets,

247
00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:04.110
but like you find out if they're compatible religion, you ask about politics,

248
00:13:04.111 --> 00:13:06.120
these things that are actually considered taboo,

249
00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.540
like ensuring that compatibility like saves you a lot of time,

250
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:14.010
especially like in the Bay. Um, like word politics is such a big deal here.

251
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:17.250
If I'm dating a girl and like, um,

252
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:20.880
she's not cool with the fact that I'm libertarian and not liberal,

253
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:24.570
which a lot of girls here, like, aren't like, you know, I'm not,

254
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:27.870
I'm not crazy about it, but like if she's crazy about it and ends right there,

255
00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:32.610
um, lot of people will assume that getting to the second date is like a positive

256
00:13:32.611 --> 00:13:33.444
step.

257
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:37.950
I think a lot of times avoiding the second date can be a positive step in that.

258
00:13:37.951 --> 00:13:40.350
Like you're getting that signal fast enough that like you figure out whether or

259
00:13:40.351 --> 00:13:44.010
not you actually have interest in this person. And that's not me rationalizing.

260
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:48.360
Cause I never go on second. But like I, I think, you know,

261
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:51.780
in general, whenever I've gone past the second date,

262
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.270
it's been with someone I've actually been very compatible with.

263
00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:58.560
And I feel like that's been more valuable to me than kind of wasting my time on

264
00:13:58.561 --> 00:14:00.630
second and third dates with people I'm not actually interested.

265
00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.950
<v 1>I think that makes a lot of sense because yeah, no, most of the times,</v>

266
00:14:04.951 --> 00:14:07.200
like even if I go to seven days, third dates,

267
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.850
I don't really like the girl that much. Right. And I think that's a problem.

268
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:15.450
Cause I wasn't optimizing for like, Oh, finding someone that's compatible.

269
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:19.560
It was me just maybe just like an ego thing, try and be like, Oh yeah, yeah. I,

270
00:14:19.561 --> 00:14:23.880
I got to the second day kind of a thing and it was a lot less about us,

271
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:25.770
but more about me kind of a thing.

272
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.200
<v 2>It's like really easy to say, like check points.</v>

273
00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.330
Like even everyone does this on Tinder too. Right?

274
00:14:30.331 --> 00:14:33.120
You compare how many matches you have with other people. Um,

275
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.280
part of it's because the process is gamified.

276
00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:39.300
And so like it's really easy to tie things to it and calculate exactly how

277
00:14:39.301 --> 00:14:43.290
you're doing and track all that. It's addictive. It gets people to keep on.

278
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:43.620
Yeah.

279
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.220
<v 1>Yeah. For a potential girlfriend, there are certain check boxes. Right.</v>

280
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:50.640
But these check boxes don't really mean anything.

281
00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:55.070
Once I start talking to them and I just really enjoy myself with them,

282
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.790
I always end up in the stage where it's like, Oh, I really enjoy this person,

283
00:14:58.791 --> 00:15:01.520
but she doesn't have these certain check boxes. You know, it's,

284
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:04.940
it's a little bit shallow before a girlfriend or at least like, or like a wife,

285
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:09.650
you know, I want her to make at least decent money, uh, college educated,

286
00:15:09.651 --> 00:15:10.370
stuff like that.

287
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:14.750
But sometimes I meet girls who are like not college educated even, or even, um,

288
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.180
they do something that I really don't care about,

289
00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:18.890
but I have a lot of fun with them.

290
00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:24.800
So I continue to like hang out with them, but it always has to end.

291
00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.290
<v 0>Hanging out. Yeah. I go on dates.</v>

292
00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.170
<v 1>You with them a lot. Right? Yeah. Cause I do enjoy their company,</v>

293
00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.200
but then once it comes to like something more serious, it's like,

294
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:39.580
Oh it has to end. And I feel like I've wasted a lot of my time because of them.

295
00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:43.180
<v 2>I like that whole increased wellness thing or like crying yourself,</v>

296
00:15:43.181 --> 00:15:44.380
wiping away the tears with your mom.

297
00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:49.870
<v 0>So much casual sex people just look at me,</v>

298
00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.070
it's take a piece of meat.

299
00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:54.670
<v 1>Because you know, dating is kind of like a funnel, right?</v>

300
00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.000
Like you have to get matched first and then you have to get whatever dah, dah,

301
00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:02.290
how do you optimize the top of the funnel, which is through dating apps. Yeah.

302
00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:07.450
<v 2>99% Of your profiles, your photos. Right. Everyone says that bio matters.</v>

303
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:12.610
Bio doesn't matter. Um, I'm going to call out one of my favorite books,

304
00:16:12.611 --> 00:16:15.220
which is data Clarism. Um, it's written by Christian rudder.

305
00:16:15.221 --> 00:16:19.300
He's the former CEO of OkCupid, really smart guy, really fun guy.

306
00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:21.550
And he did a lot of analytics.

307
00:16:21.551 --> 00:16:25.960
So he'd actually eventually stepped down as CEO to go 50% CEO and then 50% just

308
00:16:25.961 --> 00:16:28.180
writing the blog and doing analytics at okay, cute.

309
00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:29.380
Because that's what he really loved doing.

310
00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:33.130
And one of his posts is about how they try to have OkCupid,

311
00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:37.600
like users rate other users based on their looks and based on their personality.

312
00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:40.600
If you had really good books, you also got rated really high on personality.

313
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:41.650
Even if you had a blank bio.

314
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:45.130
<v 0>They showed this one girl who was like.</v>

315
00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:49.090
<v 2>It's like a black and white model photo of her with like a log or something</v>

316
00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:51.790
here. You can, you can just edit it in. And right here, something like that,

317
00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.910
her like average personality radios,

318
00:16:54.911 --> 00:16:58.570
like a 4.5 out of five or something just because she was that hot.

319
00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:01.390
It really is your photos that matter. Um,

320
00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.640
I don't think many people are naturally ugly.

321
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.610
I think a lot of people just don't feel comfortable with having photos taken of

322
00:17:06.611 --> 00:17:10.030
them like myself, a hundred percent included there. So when I started at Tinder,

323
00:17:10.031 --> 00:17:13.810
I had a lot of like blurry photos, bad lighting, you know, group photos,

324
00:17:13.811 --> 00:17:16.420
that kind of stuff. Cause I don't like being in front of a camera.

325
00:17:16.421 --> 00:17:19.720
I'm one of those people where like my natural reaction to seeing a cameras,

326
00:17:19.721 --> 00:17:23.200
to do like a stupid face kind of thing. It's just, I did that. Always,

327
00:17:23.201 --> 00:17:26.740
even as a kid, I fixed a lot of that. So like I, I learned how to smile.

328
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:30.100
Normally I kind of upgraded my photos a bit to be more about okay.

329
00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:33.850
<v 1>And going to use like the timer or you could take selfies with a good camera.</v>

330
00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.640
<v 0>I have friends. So friends are, Oh yeah.</v>

331
00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.230
<v 2>No, I don't think any of my photos or selfies. God, I hope they aren't.</v>

332
00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.790
You know my profile picture like that.

333
00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.570
<v 0>Yeah. Actually most of them that's, that's a timer, right? Yeah.</v>

334
00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:51.030
<v 1>It's so what I mean, it is a selfie as an I took it, but yeah. It's the timer.</v>

335
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:54.840
How many takes did you have to do for that one? I don't know, like 20 something,

336
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:59.760
30 something I don't, you are dedicated. And I do a lot of faces to like.

337
00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.053
<v 0>They all look bad.</v>

338
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.140
<v 1>The one that's like, okay.</v>

339
00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:10.850
And then when I put on like Facebook people secretly tell me like, Oh,

340
00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.520
by the way, it's not a good photo, man. It's like, you don't know,

341
00:18:13.521 --> 00:18:15.920
what's a good photo of yourself. Not always. Right.

342
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.440
<v 2>There's one like secret trick that does actually work,</v>

343
00:18:18.441 --> 00:18:20.150
which is including dogs in your profile.

344
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.550
And like it's one of those stereotypical things where people think it doesn't

345
00:18:22.551 --> 00:18:26.570
matter that much, but it boosts your right swipe rate by like a huge margin.

346
00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.480
Just having a dog in your profile. Even if it's not your dog.

347
00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.790
I did have my dog in my photos either.

348
00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.790
Like I have a dog and I had a cuter dog in my photos instead.

349
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:38.330
<v 0>Yo my dogs.</v>

350
00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:42.740
<v 2>Or a puppy. So I had to find this other puppy and put him in. That would be, um,</v>

351
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.100
I don't love you. Absolutely love my dog. I'm sorry. Is that okay?

352
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:50.450
<v 1>Cool. Very good boy. So I guess for the remainder of the time,</v>

353
00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:53.420
we'll just talk about like you as a person. Cause uh, you know,

354
00:18:53.421 --> 00:18:57.110
people want to get to know you. I think at least like the people on discord.

355
00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.720
<v 0>No, there we go. You got like five people who are interested.</v>

356
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:03.290
We're gonna get 10 views on this bad boy. So what do you do for fun?

357
00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:07.460
<v 2>So I was a competitive gamer in college. Oh. Um, legal legends.</v>

358
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:08.813
I have no idea.

359
00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.300
<v 0>Yeah. Never told you about this.</v>

360
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.570
<v 2>Which I played at. Um, I've been playing since season one.</v>

361
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:16.730
I got up to like high master.

362
00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:18.770
It was really close to challenge or back in the day. Um,

363
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:23.090
so I used to play a lot, just end up on like pro streams just to get recognized.

364
00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:24.800
That was like a big motivator for me.

365
00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:26.930
I still play now if I'm not feeling as good,

366
00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:31.370
but like just the fact that people knew my name was like so satisfying to me.

367
00:19:31.371 --> 00:19:34.190
Even if they didn't think I was a good player for my rating.

368
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:37.310
I was known for being one of the worst players. That was your rating. AP Sona.

369
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.770
<v 0>Oh I know he's soda. Why did I play soda?</v>

370
00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.720
Yeah. I, you know me too. Holy.

371
00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:49.850
<v 2>It's fun. It was a time sink. Um, so I, I still play that.</v>

372
00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:53.600
I do bar trivia bar. Oh yeah. I was a Quizbowl nerd in height.

373
00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:54.501
<v 1>Wait,</v>

374
00:19:54.501 --> 00:19:58.070
so is it trivia for anything or is it just shows or it's a lot of pop culture,

375
00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:58.933
a lot of pop culture.

376
00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.490
<v 2>Um, I'm a sports buff mostly. So like I do,</v>

377
00:20:01.491 --> 00:20:04.280
I do fantasy football and I watch a lot of hockey.

378
00:20:04.281 --> 00:20:06.920
I'll go to maybe like five or six sharks games a year,

379
00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.130
beginning into couple of weird things recently. I've been getting not weird,

380
00:20:10.131 --> 00:20:12.770
but like weird for me beginning into meditation.

381
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:17.390
<v 1>Oh, that's good. That's good. I tried getting into it. I was okay for a while,</v>

382
00:20:17.391 --> 00:20:19.310
but then I suddenly stopped and then I never came back.

383
00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.060
I think I should try to come back to it, but why do you like that?

384
00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:24.980
<v 2>I, I recognized I was like getting stressed just,</v>

385
00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.000
and so like it was one of those things where I was like, I need to control this.

386
00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:32.570
They use Headspace. Yeah. I use space. That's AIG now.

387
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:36.260
Um, what level are you bro? I mean,

388
00:20:36.261 --> 00:20:39.350
I I've only been doing it now for like a few weeks. Yeah.

389
00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:43.670
Amateur hour here. Um, but it's been helping so far.

390
00:20:43.671 --> 00:20:47.320
I think it's important to get that. Like I'm going to make a bold statement.

391
00:20:47.321 --> 00:20:48.250
I don't know if it's true.

392
00:20:48.251 --> 00:20:51.730
I think anxiety and depression are pretty common in the Bay area due to the

393
00:20:51.731 --> 00:20:53.500
amount of stress that work puts on you here.

394
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.200
Like I definitely felt more stressed here than I did when I was living out in

395
00:20:56.201 --> 00:20:58.870
Texas. And I think that's true for like a lot of other people. Okay.

396
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.630
So that's been one thing. The other one that I'm starting to learn is Mandarin.

397
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:04.930
Um, so I can hit on Chinese coworkers. Um,

398
00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.990
I'm starting to learn like basic sentences, understand the tones,

399
00:21:07.991 --> 00:21:09.910
that kind of stuff. Cool. It's one of those things where like,

400
00:21:09.911 --> 00:21:12.730
I feel like it's actually useful to know here given that like so many of my

401
00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:14.620
coworkers are like native Mandarin speakers.

402
00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:16.750
Whenever I've learned a language in the past,

403
00:21:16.751 --> 00:21:19.720
you hit that point where you need to start like speaking it with people and then

404
00:21:19.721 --> 00:21:22.750
like, I didn't have anyone to speak anything with, um, here.

405
00:21:22.751 --> 00:21:24.430
I don't think that's gonna be a problem. Yeah.

406
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:29.160
<v 1>So lots of coworkers. Yeah. Cool. All right. Well that's about it.</v>

407
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:34.170
Thank you so much for the interview. Thank you. Thank you about dating.

408
00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:35.640
Um, you know,

409
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:40.200
hopefully a lot of my viewers are gonna get some tips and tricks and then they

410
00:21:40.201 --> 00:21:43.140
won't watch my videos anymore because they have something better to do.

411
00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:44.243
If you hit up the discs.

412
00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.880
<v 2>I will give out some profile critiques to y'all, you know? Yeah.</v>

413
00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:53.070
It takes me like 30 seconds both to critique a profile and also in bed. So

414
00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:55.613
it'll be quick.

415
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:58.080
<v 1>All right. Cool. Cool. So, yeah. So before ending,</v>

416
00:21:58.081 --> 00:22:02.640
I just want to say that this video is sponsored by express VPN and protect our

417
00:22:02.641 --> 00:22:07.050
private data better than Cameron protects his virginity with express VPN.

418
00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:11.580
I use express VPN when shopping or working on sensitive stuff abroad or in

419
00:22:11.581 --> 00:22:15.240
public cafes in those cafes, their networks are unsecured.

420
00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:17.910
So it leaves user at great risk. For example,

421
00:22:17.911 --> 00:22:21.750
a man in middle attack can occur when someone intercepts her data requests.

422
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:25.740
So it allows them to eavesdrop and exploit real-time transactions and

423
00:22:25.741 --> 00:22:26.670
conversations,

424
00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:31.320
allowing them to steal your personal information express VPN lets you use the

425
00:22:31.321 --> 00:22:33.960

downloads and search histories. Private.

427
00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:39.390
Every time you use the internet without express VPN,

428
00:22:39.391 --> 00:22:43.560
you're putting your sensitive data at risk express VPN costs less than

429
