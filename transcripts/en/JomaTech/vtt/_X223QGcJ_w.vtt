WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.070
<v 0>I was like pretty happy at Google,</v>

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.310
but I felt like I could be like happier doing something else.

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.440
So I hope you don't mind me asking, but like, so how much do you make,

4
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.250
uh, with CS dojo now? Uh,

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.900
so it's kinda tricky because it goes up and down a little bit. Okay. Uh,

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.820
but I would say the average for the past few months has

7
00:00:23.821 --> 00:00:28.560
been about 10,000 us dollars per month. Yeah.

8
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.440
<v 1>Before we continue as this video,</v>

9
00:00:30.441 --> 00:00:33.920
I just want to say that this video is sponsored by go.co.

10
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.390
now.co domains are dope. They're pretty much the hottest domains.

11
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.130
Like for example, vine.co. Now, if you watch my startup series,

12
00:00:43.131 --> 00:00:46.190
you would know that I have a startup called not fine.

13
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.530
So I actually wanted to get not vine.co because I

14
00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:55.820
really want it to mimic vine.co. Unfortunately, when I checked the website,

15
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.510
it wasn't available. Someone took it before me.

16
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.700
I wonder if they watch my series, but basically they took it before me. And, uh,

17
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.420
unfortunately can't get that, but I was able to get

18
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.460
revived.co by the way, Revine is basically my nemesis startup,

19
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.470
which is exactly the same as not mine.

20
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.530
I haven't fully decided what to do with it yet,

21
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.770
but I'm pretty sure that it's going to be something video related either.

22
00:01:21.771 --> 00:01:25.460
I can just have it as an alias for kind of like my portfolio for all my videos,

23
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.650
or I can have like a user submitted video platform that I can make. We'll see,

24
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.770
we'll see. Anyways, back to go.co.

25
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.240
So go.co is a place to find.co domains. And like I said,

26
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.920
dot co is pretty dope. Dot co is basically like.io,

27
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.210
but way cooler, like.io. So old fashioned,

28
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.160
it's not cool anymore. Nobody uses that anymore. It's all about.co.

29
00:01:52.161 --> 00:01:55.700
Now all the hottest startups use.co for example, like I said,

30
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.700
fine.co and there's other ones like angel.co.co bird.co.

31
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.830
These are all like super dope companies.

32
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.780
They have over 2.2 million domains registered worldwide.

33
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.920
It's short, so you can easily type it on your phone. It's memorable.

34
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.430
So if you have a startup, it's a very unique name for your brand,

35
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.410
which is very useful for a startup. So if you want to register a.co domain,

36
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.330
go to go.co and register your domain now, and then also build something with it.

37
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.160
I can't wait to see what you guys build.

38
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.330
<v 0>All right. So welcome. Um,</v>

39
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.620
I usually don't like talk to the camera anymore. I drive to you, but yeah,

40
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.180
pretty much stay with question. Yeah. So anyways, um, yeah,

41
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.630
so you want to just give a little introduction to like my viewers and stuff like

42
00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:47.990
that, like for example, your name or channel itself, like sure. Yeah.

43
00:02:47.991 --> 00:02:49.800
Just real quick. All right.

44
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:54.590
I guess I'm going to talk into the camera if you want. Yeah. Whatever. Uh,

45
00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:58.580
so as you know, my name is Y K, uh,

46
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.620
and I'd been running, you know, my YouTube channel, uh,

47
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.730
called CSL joke.

48
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.960
It's a programming and discussion YouTube channel that I've been running for the

49
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:12.490
past three years now, the first year I did it, part-time, uh, you know,

50
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:17.290
while I was working at Google as a software developer and then the

51
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:21.640
past two years have been full time, uh, you know,

52
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:24.070
a lot of people ask me like, can I make a living out of it?

53
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.330
And the answer is yes, I can. And that's what I've been doing. Cool.

54
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.880
<v 1>So, yeah, I mean, honestly, I'm like super impressed that, you know,</v>

55
00:03:32.881 --> 00:03:37.140
you were able to like, quit your job at Google and then start like YouTube,

56
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.340
like pretty much full-time now. Um, yeah, so I was wondering like,

57
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.010
is like, I've seen the video of what you could Google,

58
00:03:44.011 --> 00:03:46.860
but do you want to just like talk about it again, then the house,

59
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.630
maybe more questions about it. Yeah.

60
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.430
So why did you quit Google and started YouTube, right? Full-time now. Yeah.

61
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.390
Full time.

62
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.550
<v 0>Yeah. Uh, so, you know,</v>

63
00:03:56.551 --> 00:04:00.360
this is something I've already talked about on this channel, like you mentioned.

64
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.220
Yeah. But I sort of thought about it again for this particular interview

65
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.450
and here's the way I think about it. Uh, you know, there are,

66
00:04:09.451 --> 00:04:13.260
there are sort of two parts to it. The first part was that, you know,

67
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.980
I wanted to like spend more time on YouTube, get better at, you know,

68
00:04:16.981 --> 00:04:21.510
making videos and basically help more people. And then the second part was that,

69
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.570
uh, I was like pretty happy at Google,

70
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.890
but I felt like I could be like happier doing something else. So maybe like.

71
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.850
<v 1>You know, either of them, if you want me to yeah. Both of them.</v>

72
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.770
<v 0>Yeah, sure. Uh, so the YouTube part, uh, you know, this one,</v>

73
00:04:37.771 --> 00:04:40.350
I think there are like two ways of thinking about it. Uh,

74
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.340
and both of them are true. The first one is that, you know,

75
00:04:44.341 --> 00:04:48.390
I had about 7,000 subscribers and maybe like,

76
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.610
um, you know, about a hundred thousand total views at that point,

77
00:04:53.611 --> 00:04:57.880
like right before I left Google. Wow. Okay. Yeah. So it's, it's like,

78
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.380
it's not like a lot of views, but it's, you know, it's some traction.

79
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.720
<v 1>Yeah. That's pretty gutsy. Cause like, yeah.</v>

80
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.380
I wouldn't like I would be too afraid to do it even now for my channel.

81
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.510
<v 0>Right. Yeah. I like, I was pretty afraid, but I still like, sort of did it and,</v>

82
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.640
you know, I had like a few courses going on and I was making, uh, I don't know,

83
00:05:17.641 --> 00:05:20.880
like 300, $400 from those courses,

84
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.110
like a month or a month and basically nothing from YouTube.

85
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.570
So what w my original idea was okay,

86
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.510
if I can make like 10 more courses like that,

87
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.310
I will make like three to four K a month and that's going to be enough for like

88
00:05:35.311 --> 00:05:36.690
rent and food and everything else.

89
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.340
So that that's sort of the financial plan I had.

90
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.540
And at the same time, I, I, you know,

91
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.800
I thought that I would be able to help a lot more people, you know,

92
00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.600
through my YouTube channel with them through my job.

93
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.160
So that's sort of one way of looking at it, uh, the other way of looking at it,

94
00:05:56.161 --> 00:06:01.040
which is also true is that I saw this business opportunity and I didn't want to

95
00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:03.080
miss it. Right, right, right. That makes a lot of sense. Yeah.

96
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.270
<v 1>Okay. So I hope you don't mind me asking, but like,</v>

97
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.740
so how much do you make, uh, with CS dojo now?

98
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.560
<v 0>Uh, so it's kind of tricky because it goes up and down a little bit. Okay. Uh,</v>

99
00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.480
but I would say the average for the past few months has

100
00:06:22.481 --> 00:06:25.630
been about 10,000 us dollars per month.

101
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.270
<v 1>Nice. Yeah. And then the breakdown was like 40%. Um, yeah.</v>

102
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.870
Okay. That's the same break now. Yeah. Wow. That's pretty cool. Nice.

103
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.840
Do you want to make more or like, are you okay with that now?

104
00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.840
<v 0>I'm happy with it. You know, like I said earlier,</v>

105
00:06:40.841 --> 00:06:43.480
I want to be able to stabilize my income a little bit more,

106
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.840
but I don't see any reason to like, make more because like,

107
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.080
I can do everything on my own, like editing shooting.

108
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.860
<v 1>Cool. Awesome. Yeah. But like,</v>

109
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.750
it's crazy how you validated this business opportunity just with like your

110
00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:01.870
YouTube channel. Cause you know, a lot of times when you hear about startups,

111
00:07:01.871 --> 00:07:05.350
they always talk about, okay, you build the NDP, validate your idea,

112
00:07:05.351 --> 00:07:07.150
and then you go all in.

113
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.990
So can you kind of say that your YouTube channel when it was only 7,000

114
00:07:10.991 --> 00:07:12.850
subscribers that was already an MVP?

115
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.510
<v 0>Yeah, that was, that was one of the MVPs I had. Okay.</v>

116
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.350
<v 1>Were you ever scared that like, Oh, maybe it won't grow anymore.</v>

117
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:25.690
<v 0>And it's the top? I was actually super scared until like,</v>

118
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.710
maybe like six months in. So like I left Google, uh,

119
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.560
two years ago in April, may, something like that.

120
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:38.150
And then I think if I remember correctly in August or September of the

121
00:07:38.151 --> 00:07:41.170
same year, like six months after I quit my job,

122
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.840
I was making like a thousand dollars a month. And I was like, I like, I,

123
00:07:45.841 --> 00:07:50.560
I spending a lot more than I'm making. Yeah. But like, as a,

124
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.350
as a kid, you know, I just like going, I guess, what was that?

125
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.620
<v 1>The, the biggest pulling factor? Was it that, Oh,</v>

126
00:07:56.621 --> 00:07:59.770
there's like a big business opportunity or was it like, Oh,

127
00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:00.880
I really want to help a lot.

128
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.010
<v 0>Of people, both, like, I would say equally.</v>

129
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.470
<v 1>Equally important for the business opportunity. Like,</v>

130
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:09.730
were you more motivated by like how much money potentially can you get or, okay.

131
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:10.983
So.

132
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:15.760
<v 0>Not like not the amount of money I would say it's more about, uh,</v>

133
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:19.810
the, sort of the stability that comes from being a business owner,

134
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:24.370
because when you're on an employee, no matter how good the company is,

135
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.110
there's always a risk of either being laid off or being fired. Right.

136
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.620
And like, I don't see Google doing that anytime soon,

137
00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.460
but it's possible like in 10, 20 years. So I thought like,

138
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.440
by having a business, you know,

139
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:43.300
my financial situation will be like stable in the longterm. Basically.

140
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:47.230
<v 1>It's really funny. Cause like most people, when they don't want to go, you know,</v>

141
00:08:47.231 --> 00:08:51.010
start your own business or start your own startup is because they have more

142
00:08:51.011 --> 00:08:53.050
financial stability in a company.

143
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.580
So I'm very surprised that you're actually like, yeah.

144
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.910
<v 0>Yeah. It's, it's a funny way or thinking about it.</v>

145
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.180
But the way I think about it is, you know, in the short term,

146
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.740
it's obviously more stable to have a job, but in the longterm, I mean,

147
00:09:07.741 --> 00:09:09.930
my business is still pretty unstable,

148
00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:13.800
but if I have like two or three businesses, I don't have to like rely on,

149
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.640
you know, one of them to like, got it. Got it. Yeah. Yeah. So,

150
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:22.020
so like when I made those videos back then I was definitely making, you know,

151
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.410
a lot less money, I would say, I don't remember exactly,

152
00:09:25.411 --> 00:09:29.160
but I think it was like two, three K a month. Uh,

153
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.830
but now it's like comparable to what I used to make it.

154
00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.600
<v 1>What do you use to make? Okay. Yeah. So can you tell me more about like the,</v>

155
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.560
all the Reverend or like all the sources of income that you get and like,

156
00:09:39.561 --> 00:09:42.980
which was the biggest, you know, just so that if ever you guys want to do it,

157
00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.100
you can try or they could at least know how it goes.

158
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.560
<v 0>Yeah, of course. Uh,</v>

159
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:52.400
so I guess the first thing I would say about that is that it's really tough,

160
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:56.090
you know, doing, you know, doing business on YouTube. Uh,

161
00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.510
but for me at the breakdown, I think is about like,

162
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.250
I would say 40 to 45% YouTube ad revenue,

163
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:08.570
40 to 50 or 40 to 45% something like, something like that. Yeah.

164
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:12.110
This is not the exact number, but that's sort of the rough number.

165
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:17.630
And then the rest is my courses. Uh, you know,

166
00:10:17.631 --> 00:10:22.520
I feel like it marketing next sponsorships. I did a little bit, but you know,

167
00:10:22.521 --> 00:10:25.100
it's not, it's not on the ongoing payment. Okay.

168
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.820
<v 1>Sponsorship, meaning like a flat rate, right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

169
00:10:28.821 --> 00:10:31.610
That's pretty funny. Cause like, for me, um,

170
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.850
to ad revenue is very little, um,

171
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:39.530
I think it's probably like maybe 20%. Okay. Yeah.

172
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:42.230
And then everything else is just a flat rate. Sponsorships.

173
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:47.300
I just started doing the affiliate link recently with algo expert IO.

174
00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.810
And I actually use the other one too, that you use,

175
00:10:50.811 --> 00:10:55.010
which is daily coding problem. Yeah. I use my promo code if you want.

176
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:55.993
<v 0>No</v>

177
00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.440
[inaudible] no, I was just kidding. [inaudible].

178
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:07.730
<v 1>And um, yeah, so far it seems like that's okay too, but yeah, like for me,</v>

179
00:11:07.731 --> 00:11:12.590
I just do like a lot of flat rate sponsorships and um, and yeah,

180
00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.080
those ones are pretty good so far.

181
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:20.300
Are you thinking that you might expand in terms of monetization? How?

182
00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.230
<v 0>Yeah, so for monetization,</v>

183
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.460
I'm happy where I am because I'm at a point where, you know,

184
00:11:28.461 --> 00:11:32.210
I can basically afford my rent and food and everything else

185
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:37.730
and that's basically all I need. Uh, but you know, content wise,

186
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.850
um, yeah, I'm still thinking about it.

187
00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.760
I was thinking maybe like more interview, uh,

188
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:48.530
kind of videos or podcasts or maybe going into machine

189
00:11:48.531 --> 00:11:49.364
learning or something.

190
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.390
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense.</v>

191
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:54.080
I remember you making a video about quantum computers. Yeah. Like,

192
00:11:54.081 --> 00:11:58.050
are you interested in like the most novel tech and stuff like that? No.

193
00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.260
<v 0>No, no, no, not necessarily.</v>
