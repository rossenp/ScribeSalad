<v 0>Hey guys. So this interview is split into three parts.</v>

4
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.660
If you're new to this channel, you probably came here for part one.

5
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.190
Now for part two and three,

6
00:00:22.191 --> 00:00:25.460
this is for my subscribers for people who care about sun. Me,

7
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:26.870
not a lot of people do,

8
00:00:26.871 --> 00:00:30.410
but for some of you here is the chance to get to know her. And yeah,

9
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.880
it's pretty fun. And uh,

10
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.850
I hope you guys learned something and I hope you guys have fun watching this

11
00:00:34.851 --> 00:00:36.950
video. What's popping guys.

12
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.780
Welcome to another tech show where we give tips and tricks on how to land a

13
00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:45.650
successful career in tech. You're just moving your eyebrows.

14
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.910
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

15
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.350
<v 0>Cool. So today, as you can see, we have a special guest [inaudible].</v>

16
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.870
<v 2>Hi everyone. And send me.</v>

17
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.390
<v 0>Not the K-pop star. Unfortunately, just a, just a software engineer.</v>

18
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.340
But you know, it's,

19
00:01:04.341 --> 00:01:07.370
it's better than nothing that today what we're going to talk about,

20
00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:10.910
we're just going to talk about some me's journey on how she got into software

21
00:01:10.911 --> 00:01:14.960
engineering and it was highly requested. So, you know,

22
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.780
and she would also request it to be on my videos.

23
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.040
That's why I asked her here because she backed me. So, all right, carry on.

24
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.260
Let's see why. So, so,

25
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.650
so before we begin, short bullet questions,

26
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.990
Mac or PC Mac, nice iPhone or Android,

27
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.910
easy choice. Favorite language, Korean,

28
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.720
favorite programming language. Favorite programming, language.

29
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.030
<v 2>Python. Nice.</v>

30
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.790
<v 0>Nice. I like Python two, a favorite editor.</v>

31
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.900
<v 2>Oh, Ooh, no.</v>

32
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.430
<v 0>No. What's wrong with them.</v>

33
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.260
<v 2>I used to use them a lot, but now I think he makes us better.</v>

34
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.640
<v 0>Really? All right. Coffee or tea? Coffee.</v>

35
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.140
Nice hint. Or like Croix. What? Wait, wait,

36
00:02:12.141 --> 00:02:13.490
why do you work with [inaudible].

37
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.110
<v 2>Like the sparkling water.</v>

38
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.650
<v 0>Dude. Hint has sparkling water by the way. No, no, no. Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.610
Marketing, take it out.

40
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.790
<v 1>Okay. [inaudible].</v>

41
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.530
<v 0>Okay. Cool. All right. So let's talk about your journey to software engineering.</v>

42
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:34.790
Where'd you go to high school in?

43
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.240
<v 2>Um, I went to high school in China, actually.</v>

44
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.100
<v 0>Wait, shoot, Korean.</v>

45
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.001
<v 2>I'm Korean.</v>

46
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:45.860
So I was born in Korea and I lived there until another elementary

47
00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:49.610
school. And then I went to Beijing for my multiple high school.

48
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.720
<v 0>Oh, fascinating. Fascinating. So wait,</v>

49
00:02:53.721 --> 00:02:55.850
so why did you go to China?

50
00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.030
<v 2>I think it was a combination of my dad's work as well as my mom wanted to give</v>

51
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:04.330
me a better education by sending me to an international school.

52
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.520
<v 0>Nice. So did you do any CS classes when you were there? No. No. So wait,</v>

53
00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:09.030
when was it.

54
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.340
<v 2>Also didn't have any CS? Yeah.</v>

55
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.340
<v 0>And either so, but like most, apparently most American schools,</v>

56
00:03:14.341 --> 00:03:15.420
they have CS in high school.

57
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.920
<v 2>Yeah. That was not a thing here. And then what'd you do after,</v>

58
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.840
after high school? I came to the U S for college or was it a Stanford?

59
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.790
<v 0>Sanford? I've never heard of it. What is it?</v>

60
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.900
<v 2>Yeah, it was just like school and California or I suppose it's in Paul.</v>

61
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.820
So if I ever heard of it, it's not bad. It's like decent.

62
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.670
<v 0>Okay. Is it? I heard it was okay for, I heard it's kind of like,</v>

63
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.520
it's like Waterloo, but United States. Right.

64
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:44.790
<v 3>Did you have a Waterloo?</v>

65
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.350
<v 0>Okay. Now I know what it is. Cool. Cool. Yeah. So how did you get in Sam?</v>

66
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.090
<v 2>I mean, I mostly applied to you at schools, so same exact process,</v>

67
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.250
online applications.

68
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.063
[inaudible] in China.

69
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.030
<v 0>Okay. What was your sat score?</v>

70
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.810
<v 2>Okay. It's 2380.</v>

71
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.830
<v 0>It doesn't mean much to me.</v>

72
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.583
<v 3>That's pretty impressive.</v>

73
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.420
<v 0>All right. Yeah. So, so at Stanford, uh what'd you study computer science. Okay.</v>

74
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.650
And then,

75
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.090
but Stanford was like the only time that you first learned how to code, right?

76
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.460
<v 2>Yup. I actually did not know how to code at all before coming to Stanford.</v>

77
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.680
So yeah,

78
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.450
my first CS class was a Java class.

79
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.841
Actually.

80
00:04:42.841 --> 00:04:47.160
It wasn't a teleclass it was programming fundamentals that was caught in some

81
00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:49.770
form of Java. That was your first course.

82
00:04:49.771 --> 00:04:52.050
That was my very first exposure to the programming.

83
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.210
<v 0>And then I guess you fell in love with it.</v>

84
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.130
<v 2>Yeah. Um, I really liked the professor who taught,</v>

85
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.890
uh, classes because Stanford places,

86
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.310
all of their celebrity professors into their, uh,

87
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.630
beginner classes so that everyone will get on it and then they'll get hooked on.

88
00:05:09.631 --> 00:05:11.790
So they will take yes, more CS classes.

89
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.930
<v 0>So then I'm guessing just two more CS classes and then more and more.</v>

90
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.850
And did you do any internships? Yeah.

91
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.690
<v 2>I did too. And the two internships,</v>

92
00:05:21.691 --> 00:05:24.120
one at ABT and I didn't want to like

93
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.820
advocate software engineer and LinkedIn. I was an apartment.

94
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.520
<v 0>Oh, so you did both like, what'd you like more than.</v>

95
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.670
<v 2>It's really different. I mean, I'm an engineer right now,</v>

96
00:05:35.671 --> 00:05:40.020
so I ultimately chose engineering, but, um,

97
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.980
they're really different. PM is much less technical.

98
00:05:43.981 --> 00:05:48.090
At least the role I had was pretty on I'm very technical and engineering.

99
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.220
It's like all coding. So different looks.

100
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.370
<v 0>Now you're an engineer. And then what kind of engineer are you?</v>

101
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.280
<v 2>I'm? Uh, I'm Mo I work mostly on backend. Do you ever think about.</v>

102
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.580
<v 0>Trying like iOS or Android or do you like backend? You want to say?</v>

103
00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.340
<v 2>I think I want to be really solid in the backend before I expand,</v>

104
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.100
but I'm definitely interested in older device.

105
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.030
<v 0>Got it, got it. Okay. Did you get a lot of good grades in school?</v>

106
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.010
Nice, nice high school. College. I would say college. Like,

107
00:06:21.011 --> 00:06:23.650
did you get like a grazing? Do you think that matters for, um,

108
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.600
for getting hired for internships.

109
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.010
<v 2>In college? I would say I did get good grades.</v>

110
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.100
Um, but it does not really matter.

111
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.270
<v 0>Hmm. Okay. So not that much. So, so what matters more is like.</v>

112
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.910
<v 2>Your experience? Um.</v>

113
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.890
<v 0>So what about like your first internship?</v>

114
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.630
Because I'm guessing you didn't have any experience.

115
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.560
<v 2>Okay. I guess if you're a freshman and looking for a very first internship,</v>

116
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.190
you need to show everything you can in order to prove yourself.

117
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.480
So GPA would help, but then again, it's only a freshman GPA,

118
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:59.350
so it doesn't mean that much, but it's better than a really low GPA.

119
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.970
<v 0>So did you study a lot for, for the grade to God? Like, like,</v>

120
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.440
were you just studying all day,

121
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.320
like at school or did you do a lot of extracurriculars?

122
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.100
<v 2>I was involved in a lot of different student groups. Um,</v>

123
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.600
so I think it was a healthy balance of studying and also meeting new people,

124
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.660
especially when you are, you have to meet new people. That's like, well,

125
00:07:19.661 --> 00:07:24.070
freshman year is four. So I don't know if you did that. I don't know.

126
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.320
<v 0>Ah, yeah. Okay. Funny story.</v>

127
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.820
So I lived in a dorm and our dorm was next to a club, like,

128
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.540
like a pretty ratchet club. Yeah. It was, it was called fills or something.

129
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.500
Cause I lived at Laurier people from Waterloo, you would understand, but yeah.

130
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:39.723
And every,

131
00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:44.980
every Wednesday night I would hear like stuff and I would be just

132
00:07:44.981 --> 00:07:49.060
like a little theater either studying or like, you know?

133
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.460
Yeah. I mean, I wasn't a loner, like I have friends, but it's just,

134
00:07:54.461 --> 00:07:57.670
I didn't like to go out. Okay. It's antisocial.

135
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.160
Have you done any like side projects?

136
00:08:00.161 --> 00:08:03.490
Because I heard new experiences better than like grades, you know,

137
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.470
they care about experience a lot. So did you do a side project?

138
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.710
<v 2>I guess I didn't really do side projects,</v>

139
00:08:08.711 --> 00:08:13.540
but I worked part-time at a, uh, for a startup.

140
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:18.480
Um, but that was, it was just purely for experience.

141
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.650
It wasn't like I was getting paid or anything.

142
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.370
So it was almost like a side project. So that was just calling for them.

143
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.110
<v 0>So what did you do at a startup?</v>

144
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:31.390
<v 2>Mostly development as well as roadmapping because at a startup you</v>

145
00:08:31.391 --> 00:08:35.290
don't really have separate roles. Like one person does everything.

146
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.050
<v 0>So, uh how'd you even like apply to jobs?</v>

147
00:08:38.051 --> 00:08:41.080
Like did you have career fairs or did you like apply just on a website?

148
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.770
<v 2>So I did it through multiple channels.</v>

149
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:48.160
I want to occur first because Sanford has a lot of career fairs.

150
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.130
I just applied online and also got referred.

151
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:55.770
<v 0>When you got, you know, your internships, like did you, for them,</v>

152
00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:56.910
like how'd you study for now.

153
00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:02.060
<v 2>For interviews? Um, yeah, you definitely have to study for them.</v>

154
00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:06.380
I don't think just taking classes is enough for coding interviews,

155
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.790
at least unless you have a class in college that cater specifically towards

156
00:09:10.791 --> 00:09:13.160
interviewing skills. Um,

157
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:18.350
I think one book that everyone recommends and they recommended for a good reason

158
00:09:18.351 --> 00:09:21.740
is cracking the coding interview. Um, they have all the basics,

159
00:09:21.741 --> 00:09:23.930
they have the solutions for questions as well,

160
00:09:23.931 --> 00:09:26.480
so it's pretty worth it to just read through it.

161
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:31.190
And then afterwards I just went online, went on leave code, HackerRank,

162
00:09:31.191 --> 00:09:34.970
those things so that you can actually practice like coding interviews.

163
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.370
I was also in a group called Stanford consulting.

164
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:42.320
So I had done some consulting interviews before and although

165
00:09:42.321 --> 00:09:46.550
they are pretty different, it does help to have some consulting,

166
00:09:46.551 --> 00:09:50.540
guesstimation, that type of background, and then having.

167
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:55.610
<v 0>Okay. I know why it didn't get the job now for context.</v>

168
00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:01.290
I just want to put this out there. I'm like, I didn't know her before. Uh,

169
00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:02.180
I just knew her now,

170
00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:07.250
but like before I remember I actually applied for the LinkedIn role as a

171
00:10:07.251 --> 00:10:10.220
PM, same year I did not get it.

172
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.550
So in some ways we crossed paths and she took away my only

173
00:10:16.551 --> 00:10:18.830
opportunity to become a PM.

174
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:25.340
Instead I went to Microsoft. You still working for Microsoft,

175
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.930
Microsoft as a PO, uh, how were you in high school?

176
00:10:29.931 --> 00:10:33.860
Like where you like the nerdy type or like that, not that nerdy type,

177
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:36.320
you know? Definitely not the cool.

178
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:38.713
<v 2>Or the cool.</v>

179
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:42.720
<v 0>No, I didn't put cool. I just met nerdy type and not very tight, you know.</v>

180
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.760
<v 2>Dirty and not nerdy. Um,</v>

181
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:50.120
I guess I was nerdy.

182
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:55.400
<v 0>Nerd. No, but like why, why? Like for example, did you join like clubs,</v>

183
00:10:55.401 --> 00:10:57.500
like robotics or blah, blah, blah, stuff like that.

184
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:58.700
What kind of clubs you're joining?

185
00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.990
<v 2>Actually, I was only in like music related clubs,</v>

186
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.830
so I wasn't in any of like the academic clubs.

187
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:12.650
Um, I guess I considered myself nerdy because I did study a lot. So,

188
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.320
but I wasn't like the, I don't know.

189
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.350
What's the definition of a typical nerd who like really.

190
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:23.210
<v 0>I don't know someone who doesn't socialize as much. Just think me,</v>

191
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:28.100
I think I socialized. Oh, okay, cool. Cool. Yeah. So what about now?

192
00:11:28.101 --> 00:11:31.040
Like what do you do outside of work after our long work hours?

193
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.820
<v 2>So if I don't want to socialize, I would just watch TV,</v>

194
00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:40.010
create drama. You know, reality shows Korean dramas. You watch.

195
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:43.520
I recently I've been watching this like really intense one,

196
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.520
which is called PIMCO. It's like money, flour,

197
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.440
or something that translates to my clients.

198
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.180
Really intense story of how the super rich family fights for their heritage.

199
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:54.400
Classic classic.

200
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:55.810
<v 0>Where a little story or is it.</v>

201
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.580
<v 2>Oh, extremely. There's a lot of love story inside it,</v>

202
00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:02.040
but it's like a lot of intensity.

203
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:03.960
<v 0>So if you weren't a software engineer,</v>

204
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:05.850
what do you think you would have done instead.

205
00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:10.290
<v 2>Being realistic? I think I would have either gone for either consulting or.</v>

206
00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.250
<v 0>Okay. What if it, what if you could do whatever you want,</v>

207
00:12:14.251 --> 00:12:15.450
everything pays the same.

208
00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:18.990
<v 2>Whatever I want. Everything pays the same.</v>

209
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:23.550
<v 0>But you can't say like, Oh, travel, blogger, travel blogger. I know that.</v>

210
00:12:23.551 --> 00:12:26.310
That makes sense. Yeah. Travel blogger or a blogger or a food critic,

211
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.930
a food critic. You just eat because you get paid to eat. Oh,

212
00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:31.773
you have to write a book.

213
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.610
Have you ever written something about food or you have, well,

214
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:38.100
I'll share it with you, but you do right? Yeah.

215
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:42.360
<v 2>Sometimes, but mostly when I'm like, not really happy with it either. What?</v>

216
00:12:42.361 --> 00:12:44.880
I'm not really happy with it or like really happy with it.

217
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.500
<v 0>I should find her Yelp account. No, no, no. I hate this place. Okay.</v>

218
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.810
<v 2>My Yelp is all like one star reviews. Really?</v>

219
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.410
<v 0>Yeah. Cause like there's no reason to rate a good one. Yeah.</v>

220
00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:00.330
Are you elite member elite? No. No. Okay. Right. So what about,

221
00:13:00.331 --> 00:13:02.730
okay, so now, you know, new grass, software engineering,

222
00:13:02.731 --> 00:13:06.360
do you see yourself doing this for awhile? Like what's your like five-year plan?

223
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.060
<v 2>Um, if I were to stay in engineering,</v>

224
00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:12.990
I would shoot for becoming an engineering manager.

225
00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.400
Otherwise I think I would want to, uh,

226
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.020
play more of a product role.

227
00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:19.491
<v 0>Now.</v>

228
00:13:19.491 --> 00:13:23.040
I guess what we're going to do now is that we had a lot of viewers question.

229
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.990
And uh, in case you don't know,

230
00:13:24.991 --> 00:13:28.920
I have a discord channel and that is where everyone asks the questions.

231
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.170
Discord channel is on the description below.

232
00:13:31.171 --> 00:13:33.240
If you want to join that discord channel. It's really cool.

233
00:13:33.241 --> 00:13:36.030
We talk about random stuff. It's a great community. Yeah.

234
00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:39.990
So some of these questions, you know, very career related, some of them less.

235
00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:44.910
So first one career related, what was your APM internship? Like? You know,

236
00:13:44.911 --> 00:13:45.744
quick answer.

237
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.590
<v 2>My NPM internship. I liked it. I liked that a lot. Um, a lot of,</v>

238
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:52.260
I met a lot of new people, which was the best part,

239
00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:56.640
a lot of working professionals and a completely different experience.

240
00:13:56.641 --> 00:13:58.890
I was very different from coding.

241
00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:03.930
<v 0>This one less career oriented. If you were a convincing,</v>

242
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:08.340
gentleman's crushed to data, what qualities of his would you bring up first?

243
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:13.110
If I have any, if he has any,

244
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:17.183
um.

245
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:24.143
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

246
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.210
<v 0>On a scale to one to 10, how annoying is Joma.</v>

247
00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.260
<v 1>Okay. Oh, wow. Thanks.</v>

248
00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.290
<v 2>It's more like, actually I'll be nicer and more like 12.</v>

249
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:41.400
Do you watch anime? I used to which ones I used to, well,

250
00:14:41.401 --> 00:14:44.520
I didn't watch anime. I used to read the manga.

251
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:49.290
I read like one piece and I Rodo classic. Yeah.

252
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.590
<v 0>Do you think Joma is secretly gay.</v>

253
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.820
<v 2>Hundred percent gay? Oh yeah.</v>

254
00:14:55.821 --> 00:15:00.530
I have maybe like 0.1% out, but um,

255
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:01.640
I'm pretty confident.

256
00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.680
<v 0>Okay. Any low key talent or hobby?</v>

257
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:14.230
<v 2>Any low key talent or hobby? Any low key talent or hobby?</v>

258
00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:20.990
Um, talent. I don't know. Okay. Hobby. I,

259
00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:21.130
yeah.

260
00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:23.440
<v 0>I don't need to force it if you have no talents is fine.</v>

261
00:15:23.441 --> 00:15:24.830
We can just go to the next question.

262
00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:29.260
<v 2>Yeah. I have no talent. Um, I think it's I like to do, I like to play golf.</v>

263
00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.960
I like to try singleness.

264
00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:35.830
I that's it. I like to bake.

265
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:40.300
<v 0>Nice. Nice. Nice. All right. If you were to start a YouTube channel,</v>

266
00:15:40.301 --> 00:15:42.130
what kind of videos would you want to make?

267
00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:45.580
<v 2>I think I would want to make casual videos,</v>

268
00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:49.960
like lifestyle type of videos. When I travel,

269
00:15:49.961 --> 00:15:52.900
I want to film whenever I'm eating.

270
00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:58.750
<v 0>Everyone wants to do that and traveling. I see.</v>

271
00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:03.220
So I see you're a big lover of food. Yes. Hmm. Interesting. Explains the figure.

272
00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:08.650
All right. So these are my new jeans.

273
00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:15.040
All right. What were your first impression of Jola?

274
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:20.050
<v 2>My first impression of him, honestly,</v>

275
00:16:20.051 --> 00:16:21.280
I thought it was really annoying.

276
00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:26.680
<v 0>There's a reason for it. So the first time I met Sonny,</v>

277
00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:32.020
I thought she was really who we honest and the reason why is because we're

278
00:16:32.021 --> 00:16:34.720
on the same team and everyone's scattered for lunch and now it usually,

279
00:16:34.721 --> 00:16:37.090
you know, crack some jokes and you don't tell some nice stories.

280
00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.820
Everyone would laugh except for something.

281
00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:43.180
She would have that face that you see all the time in the startup series.

282
00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:48.340
That was why I cast her to be honest. So then I was like, am I like, can I,

283
00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.200
like, I don't understand. I need to crack her. Right.

284
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:53.770
So then I just started talking to him where I'm like, Hey, how's it going?

285
00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.570
And then China, you know, Cracker.

286
00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.360
And then maybe that's why she thought it was annoying.

287
00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:03.040
<v 2>Kept on like kept on like giving these like stupid jokes.</v>

288
00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:08.290
<v 0>I was like, they're good. But I think you're laughing out of politeness.</v>

289
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:13.630
<v 2>Yeah. I was coughing. I was pretending to laugh, but um, yeah,</v>

290
00:17:13.631 --> 00:17:15.850
he's fine. I mean, first impressions don't lie.

291
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:19.600
<v 0>Yeah. She's fine too. So I guess this is kind of similar,</v>

292
00:17:19.601 --> 00:17:23.320
but what is drama like at work? I guess we can talk about what I am like now.

293
00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:27.520
<v 2>Jomo works hard on his videos</v>

294
00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:32.590
and that's true. So I don't know about work,

295
00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.800
but he's working hard on something.

296
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:41.080
So there's this time when Joel was sitting next to me and he was like typing a

297
00:17:41.081 --> 00:17:45.010
lot of code. So I thought, wow, this guy is like actually working this time.

298
00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:47.920
So I got up here at over and was like, Oh, what's your working at?

299
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.950
And then I saw him just writing a lot of HTML code,

300
00:17:52.951 --> 00:17:57.330
which clearly they assigned to us. Don't write. I was like, okay,

301
00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.110
you're clearly not working on your real work. You're making your website.

302
00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:05.330
<v 0>I was making my merch shop. Yeah.</v>

303
00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.210
That's the one I thought that one time I was going to be like, wow,

304
00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:11.720
you're actually working. Like, I was literally like this like earphones on me.

305
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:17.060
I'm like, hi.

306
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:22.700
So apparently I have 2% Korean viewership, 2%,

307
00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:26.840
2%. And one of them, yeah, 2% Koreans. And then one of them said,

308
00:18:26.841 --> 00:18:30.320
say something to your Korean fans, you know, in Korea, maybe.

309
00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:35.000
<v 2>Um, cool Korean fans now</v>

310
00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:39.830
[inaudible], you know what I'm

311
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.750
[inaudible] on Dawn.

312
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:49.850
It's a key lock kill off Krakatoan quality video.

313
00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:55.593
[inaudible] [inaudible].

314
00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:00.590
<v 0>[Inaudible] thank you so much for your kind words. Um, yeah.</v>
