1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.860
<v 0>I just wanted to tell you guys something,</v>

2
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.940
because I've been kind of lying to you guys and I've been holding back

3
00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:10.170
something, but I think it's now time to come clean. Um,

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.090
so basically,

5
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.900
yo what's happened guys.

6
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.060
So today we are at the airport now and we are going to Montreal because I want

7
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:34.320
to show you guys my childhood I'll show you where I grew up, but, uh, yeah,

8
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:37.440
it's gonna be a long flight, probably like six hours, but, um, yeah,

9
00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:38.274
I'll see you there.

10
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.313
[inaudible].

11
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.370
<v 1>And here we are back in my room, back in Montreal.</v>

12
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.860
Yeah. It's quite a small room.

13
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.750
I just want to give you guys a little tour of my humble beginnings,

14
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.350
but um, yeah, I'm probably going to go sleep soon. It gets pretty late,

15
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.340
but I just want to show you a few things. Let's check it out. Ooh,

16
00:01:34.341 --> 00:01:39.080
look at this picture. This was a high school trip and this is me.

17
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
There you go. Yeah.

18
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.620
Then I had a little desk. I mean, obviously I didn't have a laptop here.

19
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.750
I didn't spend much time here, but I labeled my little drawers.

20
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.740
Like this same means drawings in French.

21
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.190
There used to be something else here. But if you just check out the books,

22
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.050
what is this from the bar to the bedroom,

23
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.380
two 11 rules. I come on focus,

24
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.310
the 11 rules for picking up and pressuring women.

25
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.820
This is why I used to read as a kid. Hilarious.

26
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.980
And here you can see diary, which is a,

27
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.030
which is like a Darwin. It had an elementary school. Well,

28
00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:30.230
let me find you the good part.

29
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.420
So here you can see clearly that I liked this girl called Cheryl. Cause I wrote,

30
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.950
you know, I decided to not care about Cheryl stuff. We're just friends. Now.

31
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.790
Anyways, today, Cheryl got mad at me again. Yeah. Tomorrow.

32
00:02:43.791 --> 00:02:47.330
I'm going to share Rose House. Hey, Hey. Hey. Hey man.

33
00:02:47.331 --> 00:02:51.770
I think Cheryl hates me again. I did a big mistake. Holy.

34
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.870
This is quite funny. So I think,

35
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.800
I think I was a graphing how much I like each of my friend.

36
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.640
Let's see. There's Alex Martin gave Alex was at 87%.

37
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.260
That is so funny. You can see how I became a data scientist.

38
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.180
Yo and there's and there's even like a reference chart.

39
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.290
A hundred percent means can share secrets. Almost impossible.

40
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.330
Negative 20 is. I hate it. But is there anyone negative 20? No,

41
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:25.540
I don't think so. All right.

42
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:30.430
I hope you enjoy this little glimpse of my cringy life. My cringey.

43
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.360
What was I? 12 year old or 11, 11 or 12 year old self.

44
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.460
Uh, I enjoyed reading that. I'm kind of glad that I wrote that when I was a kid,

45
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.560
but uh, yeah. Anyways, I'm gonna,

46
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.080
I'm going to prepare for tomorrow because tomorrow we're having a Montreal

47
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.490
meetup. Hopefully someone shows up. I don't know. We'll see. Um,

48
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.833
see you tomorrow.

49
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.090
<v 0>All right, welcome. So this is where I grew up and uh, yeah,</v>

50
00:03:54.091 --> 00:03:57.120
it's kinda sad cause I want it to go to burger King because I want to tell you

51
00:03:57.121 --> 00:04:00.690
guys a story about why we should, you know,

52
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.920
spend a little bit more money when we're younger and there's like a philosophy

53
00:04:04.921 --> 00:04:08.370
behind it. But unfortunately it became a fricking Starbucks.

54
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.560
So this is basically like a Walgreen's I used to go to a lot. Um,

55
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.050
yeah, it's called shoppers in Canada,

56
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.190
but in French it's called Philmont P it's kinda like a Walgreens and a yeah.

57
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.760
I used to go there a lot. Hit on a cashier, but uh,

58
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.220
good times. Ooh.

59
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.260
And this used to be my local gym. It was actually pretty cheap.

60
00:04:31.261 --> 00:04:36.150
I think it was like $30 a month. That's why I used to get jacked. Good times.

61
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.013
Good times.

62
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.380
This is McDonald's my first job ever. I first lived a job.

63
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.220
I mean, I worked with my parents. I started this job when I was 15.

64
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.700
I worked about a year and a half and a man,

65
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.350
like I was the first one in the history of this MacDonald that did not get a

66
00:04:55.351 --> 00:04:56.250
raise after a year.

67
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.760
It was pretty crazy because it's pretty much mandatory for you to get a raise

68
00:04:59.761 --> 00:05:04.170
after a year. But how was the only one that did not get one? Yeah,

69
00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:06.840
I was that bad. Hello.

70
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.380
As you can see, most of my fans are quite awkward

71
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.790
talking guys. Pretend I'm not here. Maybe only one lady. It's not.

72
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.810
So what's guys, Joe was in the bathroom right now.

73
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.380
So like when I interview some people. Yeah.

74
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.840
Like honestly I think drama would actually be kind of cool,

75
00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:09.860
but like he's actually really in real life. Like I thought he'd be hot,

76
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.160
like kind of cool, but like he's actually so lame and everything, man, like

77
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.610
you guys, I don't know, man, this small kid who thinks he knows everything,

78
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.410
I'm just here for the a Touche drama.

79
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.380
Yeah. I thought somebody was going to be there, man.

80
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:38.383
It was funny.

81
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.273
What were you guys talking about?

82
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:48.283
It's getting really late.

83
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.020
Jason went on Jolla. I'm Joma

84
00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.230
where you guys are bouncing. Really tough.

85
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.230
All right. So you guys,

86
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.390
you can come back. You can come back now.

87
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.880
I'm actually lonely. All right guys.

88
00:07:18.881 --> 00:07:23.350
So that was a pretty dope meetup. Thank you everyone for hanging out with me,

89
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:27.850
even though they left like 30 minutes after, but it's okay. I don't know.

90
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.130
I think it was cool. So now we're going to do, we're just going to,

91
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.280
we're just going to go grab some food, you know, chill, do some other stuff,

92
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.300
but yeah. See you later.

93
00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.050
I father, which

94
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.000
I think about it and she knows it.

95
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:51.730
I don't want to let it take control guys.

96
00:07:51.731 --> 00:07:56.080
Every time that she gets close, she pulls me.

97
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:20.140
[inaudible] you'll take me places.

98
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:43.573
[inaudible]

99
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:50.200
uh, Hey guys. Um,

100
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:55.740
I just wanted to tell you guys something because I've been kind of to you guys

101
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:57.210
and I've been holding back something,

102
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.020
but I think it's not an time to come clean. Um,

103
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.570
so basically I don't even like in water that much. Um,

104
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:08.520
like I'm not even sponsored by them,

105
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.580
but I just thought it was kind of funny and you guys really liked it.

106
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.080
I should like look for better, but yeah,

107
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:20.130
I don't want to be like in water. Oh. And also meet Jasmine. She's a,
