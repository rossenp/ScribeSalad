1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>All right. Let's walk faster. I only have 30 minutes.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.900
I'm gonna take the elevator cars just to show you extra amenities. Yeah.

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.870
So this is my, my elevator, my personal elevator and the cloud house.

4
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.000
Oh, well come to mosque, crib, our crowd there's people, artichoke lamps. But,

5
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.200
um, so this is the gym. So as you can see, if you go in to see us,

6
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.220
this is what you can get. I do. I know right next door. Yeah.

7
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.530
It's incredibly loud. So I'm going to go here. This,

8
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.530
this might sound a little bit racist, but because you guys are Korean,

9
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.190
you guys probably do some K-pop dance. Like this mirror is really cool.

10
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.810
RP can do. You're like, uh,

11
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.240
It is my personal gym.

12
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.720
I don't know why there are people in some of my gym should kick them out soon.

13
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.050
We have a lot of artwork, so that's really nice, too beautiful.

14
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.320
And this time we're going to take the stairs for exercise. Ooh.

15
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.060
<v 1>Spiral staircase. Yeah. But no,</v>

16
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.050
you got to prioritize sometimes.

17
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.370
<v 0>Yeah. Let's go somewhere else.</v>

18
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.190
The cool thing about this place is you could also rent these bikes. Oh wow.

19
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.720
And you can pretty much go anywhere,

20
00:01:08.721 --> 00:01:13.100
but you just have to bring them back and it's free. Yeah. Before we continue,

21
00:01:13.101 --> 00:01:16.250

35
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.650
How to share ideas that inspire action by Simon Sineck

36
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.960
in case you don't know Simon Sinek, he is an author and a motivational speaker.

37
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.010
The first time I heard about him is from a viral video where he talks about

38
00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:20.750
millennials in the workplace. I thought he was a great storyteller.

39
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.730
And for me, I think storytelling is an extremely important skill to have.

40
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.340

41
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.340

Harbor market. And there's a vending machine where you can order food.

46
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.320
Ooh, it's pretty funny. Cause um, sometimes it screws up,

47
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.500
like if you buy the Vietnamese sandwich.

48
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.890
<v 1>So do you want to.</v>

49
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.110
<v 0>You want to learn how to make more money with your YouTube channel? Yes.</v>

50
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.990
Or do you want to learn how to grow your channel? Cause uh, no.

51
00:03:18.991 --> 00:03:23.700
I'm your guy for that by your guy. I mean the guy who is like losing viewers,

52
00:03:23.701 --> 00:03:28.170
every there, have you watched the startup series? I have each episode.

53
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.110
I think all of them. Probably all of them. Yeah.

54
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.040
I like DMD you back in the day and I didn't get a response. Oh yeah.

55
00:03:35.041 --> 00:03:38.760
I remember that. I was like, you're kid. And then when you got back on my,

56
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.680
I think I need him now. I was like, wait, so you watch a start-up series back.

57
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.180
Dan also. Yeah. I watched it when you were how'd you discover on the rise?

58
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.130
I don't know. I think I'm not entirely sure because Oh wait. Oh no, no,

59
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.910
I didn't watch it as you were posting. I don't think. Yeah.

60
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.610
I think it was right after you finished a sort of series. And then I was,

61
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.140
I went back and watched all series, like why? Because you're trying to tack,

62
00:04:04.141 --> 00:04:05.330
so I don't get whitewashed. Oh,

63
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.160
it's the start of series or just in general or serve series is just

64
00:04:08.161 --> 00:04:12.450
entertaining. There are so many people that still think it's real. Yeah.

65
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.740
They're like, why don't

66
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.030
you just continue or not vine start-up and like,

67
00:04:18.031 --> 00:04:22.110
why do you have to get new Charlotte's Oh my God. Yeah.

68
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.130
I'm like interested in tech a little bit. Hmm. Yeah, no,

69
00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:29.390
I was a freshman in college, like exploring. Have you ever taken a CS class? Um,

70
00:04:29.391 --> 00:04:33.030
in high school? Yeah. In high school. And how was that? It was okay.

71
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.870
I didn't really have like, what did they teach you? They taught us Java.

72
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.390
I've um, tried to,

73
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.490
I I've tried as in like spent one month or like a few weeks or

74
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.560
namely swerved or like Python.

75
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.870
<v 1>Yeah. So the great benefit of computers is that</v>

76
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.580
for years you got a really, really easy, Oh my God,

77
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.730
my microphone just shooting filmmaker. So as I was saying.

78
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.673
<v 0>Yeah, with the</v>

79
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.540
[inaudible] microphone as a CS major, you know,

80
00:05:09.541 --> 00:05:11.850
you can come out with software engineering degree,

81
00:05:11.851 --> 00:05:16.500
making like 150 to 200 K right off college, and then you can afford this place.

82
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.850
So think twice before you start your business major and you two argue.

83
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.640
<v 1>This video is extra mental. Yeah.</v>

84
00:05:23.641 --> 00:05:26.820
What's what takes the most time when you fake videos and stuff like that.

85
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.910
<v 0>For me, it used to be planning. Cause I used to script my videos,</v>

86
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.830
but not anymore. Not anymore at all. It's completely edited.

87
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.460
<v 1>Yeah. I'm selling out. So I just, I just close ads,</v>

88
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.520
every single video and that it's not bad.

89
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.570
<v 0>W what's the best case scenario for your YouTube channel?</v>

90
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.430
Would you like to change a content direction? I love to do,

91
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.360
like, I love to do more creative stuff with videography. One day.

92
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.820
He's just like pretty much just like, you know,

93
00:05:58.821 --> 00:06:03.170
like travel videos except for my daily life or yes,

94
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.840
with a cinematography, with a narrative.

95
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.260
I think a lot of travel videos are all effects and not enough narrative.

96
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.890
Oh, okay. Stripes. Oh, you're lucky. Again.

97
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.050
Those are both unintentional shots.

98
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.760
<v 1>Okay. We'll leave after I get one.</v>

99
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.700
<v 0>It might be here. Might be here a while.</v>

100
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.170
<v 1>Nice. You're actually really good. I can tell.</v>

101
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.700
Cool. Yes. Jump shot. Jump shot.

102
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.740
It is getting try not to hit the camera. Oh. I'm a professional.

103
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.450
Oh, all right. Let's let's switch.

104
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.313
I don't want to talk to you.

105
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
<v 0>Oh, this is, this is RP now. And I'm going to show him a Toro. I didn't know.</v>

106
00:07:10.001 --> 00:07:14.050
You guys would dress up. I'm literally my pajamas, but it's fine, dude. Yeah.

107
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.320
I actually dressed up for this. Well, he's not dressed up. He always wears this.

108
00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.910
It looks good though. Like it's yeah. It's okay.

109
00:07:21.911 --> 00:07:24.430
It's it's it's her brand, I guess.

110
00:07:24.431 --> 00:07:29.260
So it's from a brand anyways. So this is the living room, you know,

111
00:07:29.261 --> 00:07:33.850
I bought a new projector. It's probably gonna take a while to turn on.

112
00:07:33.851 --> 00:07:36.730
So I'm not gonna turn on, but anyways, you can come here and film this.

113
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.540
What do you know what this is? Is it a wireless phone charger?

114
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:45.490
It's a very expensive a coaster, but yeah. Boom. Wow.

115
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.590
Yeah. I always wonder what would happen if I, uh,

116
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.110
if I charged my phone gonna blow up

117
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.380
or maybe it goes to a hundred percent faster, why need a projector so big?

118
00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.530
I didn't know it was going to be that big.

119
00:07:56.531 --> 00:07:58.960
I thought it was going to be this size, but uh, yeah,

120
00:07:58.961 --> 00:08:03.190
so I bought like the most expensive one and I work in tech. Okay.

121
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:08.230
Okay. And because I work in tech, I'm able to afford this. Oh. Yes. SNES.

122
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:14.890
That's cute. So, but yeah, for real, if you didn't enjoy

123
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.240
CS for your first class, it doesn't matter.

124
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:24.430
Because if you grind for a little bit, know your separate life. Okay.

125
00:08:24.431 --> 00:08:28.090
I don't know if money is important to you, but for me it's important to feel,

126
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:32.200
you know, free. So you can buy a biggest projector. I'm just like,

127
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.900
it's financial freedom. Like you're like, Oh man,

128
00:08:34.901 --> 00:08:37.600
Palo Alto restaurants are so expensive. Yeah.

129
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:41.020
I don't even think about the bill and I just, I just eat whatever I want.

130
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.100
Y'all look at this sick video. Oh, who's this thing.

131
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.490
Utuber I don't know if he looks trash. Wait, how do I go to bed?

132
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:54.520
I hate watching myself on YouTube, man. Oh man. Okay. Wait.

133
00:08:54.521 --> 00:08:55.960
Let's watch your channel. Wait.

134
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.170
[inaudible] okay. Your channel is kind of hard to find Elliot choy. Okay.

135
00:09:03.171 --> 00:09:06.860
There we go. Elliot toy Elliott, choy,

136
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:12.730
Elliot, Harvard, all man. Look at these thumbnails, man.

137
00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.860
They're still high quality. So did you know that if you, um,

138
00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:17.660
if you made a Harvard video,

139
00:09:17.661 --> 00:09:21.290
it would blow up even though you don't go to Harvard. Yeah.

140
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.310
Makes sense. Are there any YouTube ads? You guys don't like? I mean,

141
00:09:25.311 --> 00:09:29.060
just like in general. Yeah. Um, I might make a business.

142
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:33.710
One guy who lives in like mountain view. Yeah.

143
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:38.660
Just kind of an arrogant, rich prick. That's the guy. That's the guy.

144
00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:43.280
That's crazy. You asked me this is not relative. You know, a city,

145
00:09:43.281 --> 00:09:47.510
a dog save different, dude. Why do you always wear Adidas?

146
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:52.460
I'm talking to other so comfortable. Do you actually have any other? No,

147
00:09:52.461 --> 00:09:56.090
I just have, but they're pretty thrilled. I, you should have some oil.

148
00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.240
Let me show you my Adidas pants. Okay. So I bought these first for myself.

149
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.900
And then when I watched a 1 million studio, they all had it. Wow.

150
00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:08.060
So they copied me, man. Yeah. Clearly. Holy. Anyways. All right,

151
00:10:08.061 --> 00:10:10.160
let's go back and pretend you didn't see my man. All right.

152
00:10:10.161 --> 00:10:12.830
Let me show you my dope pass-through and where you can get,

153
00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:16.940
if you have a sick salary. Okay. All right. First,

154
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.840
you got my sick house. Oh, why do don't even need it?

155
00:10:20.841 --> 00:10:24.020
That's just like excessive at that point. Yeah.

156
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.600
I think for pornography is really good. Okay.

157
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.350
They don't even make that aspect ratio in pornography. I know, but,

158
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:34.040
but it's not about watching one video for me. At least I have to click on one.

159
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.070
Yeah. Oh, okay. Got it. Once the task. Right? Right.

160
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.650
So what I do is I have like, yeah, yeah.

161
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.540
And then another cool thing that you can do is it can act as

162
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.960
two different monitors. And this is actually impressive.

163
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:54.080
For example, now this monitor is attached to my computer.

164
00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:59.450
Wow. This one is attached to so crazy.

165
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:04.040
What if you had two monitors? What if had

166
00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:09.020
it's double the price. Why would I pay twice for a monitor? Yeah.

167
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:13.370
But then again, it's like, this is like 1600 trouble. Right. But yeah. Why,

168
00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.280
why shouldn't I have two monitors? Wait, there should be a good reason for it.

169
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:20.840
Oh yeah. What if I do want something in between? Whatever. I'm just rich, bro.

170
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.180
Okay. Yeah. Here, here.

171
00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:27.080
You know where I could wirelessly charge my phone? Where's my phone. Okay.

172
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.280
Let's pretend this is my phone.

173
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:32.390
So it's a slightly better because back then I would have to plug my phone in.

174
00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:35.810
Right. And when I wake up, I'd have to detach it,

175
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.410
which requires an extra step. But now when I wake up,

176
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:44.090
I'm just like this that's that's crazy deep. Boom. Yeah.

177
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.510
And also I wanted to try, I was really hoping for this one thing,

178
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:48.650
I'll tell you what it is.

179
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.010
I was hoping that this would work because this is like a wireless charging.

180
00:11:52.011 --> 00:11:55.060
Also it's doing something. Yeah. It's freaking out. Look

181
00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.580
what you're supposed to do. This is actually kind of annoying.

182
00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:03.930
You're supposed to charge him like this and then there's wireless charging.

183
00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:09.570
So I thought it would be the same kind of word short and cut. It's not. Okay.

184
00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.770
So I should DCS to get, to get wireless charging everywhere,

185
00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:18.510
more efficient to marginally. Oh,

186
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.030
I didn't even see that. Oh, wait a second.

187
00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:27.620
And now you got me interested. Like it spits out less. If you're closer to the,

188
00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:32.280
uh, to the head, let's see. Oh my God. Like it was like,

189
00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:36.390
and it's like, all right. Also Sensodyne.

190
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.540
It's the most expensive, uh, basic in gap.

191
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.320
So I'm pretty rich. And then syrup.

192
00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:48.360
You use that too, right? I do. Yeah. Good. What else do I have?

193
00:12:48.361 --> 00:12:52.440
That's impressive here with like K-pop videos.

194
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:56.940
I used to have an iPad here and I would watch K-pop while I brush my teeth as

195
00:12:56.941 --> 00:12:57.480
well.

196
00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.950
But I've outgrown that now you'd have like a TV inside of your mirrors thing.

197
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.400
Yeah. That'd be sick, but no, I don't. Oh my God. Elliot twice. Still sick.

198
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:09.720
I like this YouTuber. Yeah. I know. I don't know about that goddess. Yeah. Nice.

199
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:14.280
Cause like I know Elliot likes gear and uh, yeah, here, I got microphone.

200
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:15.990
It's wanting to my blog.

201
00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:20.670
Just like pull it here and I talk and then I put my camera here and then I

202
00:13:20.671 --> 00:13:24.210
connect this to the camera so that I could see what I look like.

203
00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:28.950
It's pretty cool. Right? What's your setup? Like? Uh, probably not as cool.

204
00:13:28.951 --> 00:13:33.930
So it doesn't matter. It's my iPhone on the tripod. Most of the time.

205
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:38.880
I'll at least have an iPhone. That's not bad. Or your iPhone? Elliot sec. Okay.

206
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.150
And then, Oh yeah. AirPods. Do you guys have AirPods? No, I don't.

207
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.850
What did apparently it's for gen Z? Like this is like the rich show.

208
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:47.250
I guess I can't be in the upper-class you know?

209
00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:52.440
I don't know like a bunch of dead, but yeah. I mean,

210
00:13:52.441 --> 00:13:56.100
I bought it when it first came out. So part of the second one's coming as soon.

211
00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.390
No, they're already out. You don't have them. I,

212
00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:00.870
I thought you would have written. Yeah, I know.

213
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.930
I thought I thought you were in tech. Yeah, I know. I know. But okay.

214
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.030
Now I'm not going to buy them. I'm going to buy them. But yeah,

215
00:14:06.031 --> 00:14:10.410
the second ones are pretty good, but mine are not. Yeah.

216
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:14.760
Apple watch. See, this is the one thing I never understood. What is it for?

217
00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:15.990
Yeah, absolutely nothing.

218
00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.020
It's actually just to tell people you're rich and right.

219
00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.930
But mine is trashed because the red.is not there. Okay.

220
00:14:21.931 --> 00:14:26.240
But people still know your. No. Oh, okay. Well we'll only if I hide,

221
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:29.760
if I hide it. Well, cause this is actually a generation three,

222
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.760
not generation four generation four is the latest version.

223
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:34.560
It's all going right over my head. I don't know.

224
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:38.250
And he's how much do you think these ducks costs? 12 bucks each.

225
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.130
I think it was like 30 bucks each.

226
00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.840
Let me use my extremely cool monitor to check it out. But like why?

227
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:50.220
Why though? Cause I'm much man. 50 bucks, 35 bucks in.

228
00:14:50.221 --> 00:14:52.310
I'm not sure this one. I think this one's a Kiwi.

229
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:56.420
If you just didn't buy all of these, how much Richard would,

230
00:14:56.421 --> 00:14:59.120
I bet you'd be $150 with you.

231
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:04.220
You could probably save it for the next AirPods for AirPods. Okay. Okay. Right,

232
00:15:04.221 --> 00:15:08.780
right. You're rich. I'm sorry. I could just take into my savings account. Okay.

233
00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:11.990
Okay. What else? What else? Uh,

234
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.140
how much do you think these costs that looks like? So. You buy a Walmart.

235
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:19.580
That's actually free. It's actually pretty cheap. That's trash. But Dan,

236
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:23.330
this is actually legit. It's a real painter. Like if you look closely.

237
00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.860
<v 1>It's paint. You know what I mean? Like the strides and.</v>

238
00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:28.670
Why don't you put this in there.

239
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:31.960
<v 0>To monitor? You can afford things to look at your Elliot. Oh,</v>

240
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:35.380
he'll ele you like yours. RP went. Where's your.

241
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.080
<v 2>Hey listen, man. I'll be uploaded.</v>

242
00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.760
<v 0>This is fun. Oh wait, have you guys heard of these.</v>

243
00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:44.403
<v 1>It's old school?</v>

244
00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:48.940
<v 0>Yeah. The flops over whatever.</v>

245
00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:53.830
I waited eight hours just to buy these uses piece of. What did they do? Uh,

246
00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.320
the blue glass. But no, no, no. It's like Snapchat.

247
00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:00.880
And then basically what you can do is you can record like 10 seconds with it and

248
00:16:00.881 --> 00:16:05.860
then send it as a snap. Pretty cool. Right? Yeah. Let me check it. Look at this.

249
00:16:05.861 --> 00:16:08.560
I have a mouse and the track pad,

250
00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.790
but why redundancy, if you, if you learned about CS,

251
00:16:12.791 --> 00:16:14.440
you would know what redundancy is all about.

252
00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:16.750
Imagine you have a hard job and you have all your files there.

253
00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:21.130
What happens if your hard drives that you lose our files? Right?

254
00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:26.590
So redundancy is about, uh, copying those files into different,

255
00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.490
you know, different, hard drives. Right? So that if you lose one,

256
00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:35.500
you're not gonna lose all of it. Right. So, uh, but, but why two for redundancy?

257
00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:39.040
And like, imagine if like, I'm like, Oh man, my mouse doesn't work anymore.

258
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:43.750
And then if you bought an expensive mouse, shouldn't it work. But it's not,

259
00:16:43.751 --> 00:16:45.490
it's not that expensive. I have a cheap mouse.

260
00:16:45.491 --> 00:16:48.730
Not because I'm poor it's because I actually like cheap mouses.

261
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.020
See that's what poor people say.

262
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.880
<v 1>Can you do this? What's your mouse. And we'll think we have,</v>

263
00:16:54.881 --> 00:16:56.890
we all have trackpads on the laptop. Yeah.

264
00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:59.230
<v 0>But what if I'm using my desktop set up?</v>

265
00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.740
I'm sure I can configure some sort of shortcut. Yeah. You could actually,

266
00:17:02.741 --> 00:17:05.080
you can actually just press like this or something. Yeah.

267
00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:09.490
Or something like that, but still okay. Right. And pressed and pressed.

268
00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:12.940
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

269
00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:18.010
<v 0>That's crazy, dude. I'm definitely gonna study CS. All right.</v>

270
00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:23.290
My job is done here and always, I'm gonna end the video. Thanks for watching.

271
00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:26.860
He's gonna join CS. All right. Thanks for watching guys.

272
00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:28.990
<v 1>Check out.</v>

273
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:30.460
<v 0>Ella channel, check out RPC channel.</v>

274
00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:31.743
<v 1>He needs it.</v>

275
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:38.620
<v 0>He doesn't even have a silver play button, but yeah, it's coming soon. I swear.</v>

276
00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.670
I didn't have, I didn't have as much fun.

277
00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:47.290
<v 1>In college because I was in CS. Now that it's off the record.</v>
