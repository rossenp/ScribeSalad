00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.350
<v 0>Hey guys, it's been awhile.</v>

2
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.270
It's been a long while. Um, and I'm sorry for that.

3
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:14.581
Uh, yeah, like I,

4
00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:19.230
haven't been making a lot of videos and I just want to say,

5
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:20.670
first of all, I'm sorry for that,

6
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.220
but I just wanted to let you guys know kind of what is going

7
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:30.360
on with my life. Um, I think, yeah,

8
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.280
maybe it would have been therapeutic or it would be therapeutic for me to tell

9
00:00:34.281 --> 00:00:39.170
you guys, I'm not sure. I might not even post this video. I'm not sure.

10
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.870
We'll see, but I'm, I'm not that okay.

11
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.250
I'm not super great. I'm not feeling great. And

12
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.370
to, oh, you how it started, but it started like probably two months ago.

13
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.250
Um, I kind of said I burnt out in one video, but I said it really like briefly.

14
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.550
So maybe that was like my cry for help. I don't know.

15
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.840
But I burnt out because yeah,

16
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.900
just like doing videos and working, you know,

17
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.600
it was pretty much like 24 hours,

18
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.550
like thinking about work or doing videos and it kind of took a toll on me,

19
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.170
you know? I mean like th th the best, the best way I can explain it is like,

20
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.760
imagine if you had a hard day at work, then, you know,

21
00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:32.570
you could come back home. You know, some people grab a beer, they watch Netflix,

22
00:01:32.571 --> 00:01:36.560
or they just don't want to do anything. But more for me,

23
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.050
maybe it was like the artificial stress that upon myself,

24
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.240
I didn't allow myself to do that because I told myself, you know,

25
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.910
the more time you waste the less, you know, I'll put,

26
00:01:46.911 --> 00:01:49.610
you can get to work or videos.

27
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.750
So if I had a hard day at work and maybe I worked extra hours,

28
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.600
like, yes, I might be doing a bit more at work. But then I was like, oh,

29
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.600
I'm losing hours for my videos. Because, you know,

30
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.820
without these hours, you know, I can't,

31
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.870
I can't post at the same cadence or the same quality and stuff like that.

32
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.030
So I really put this artificial stress on me,

33
00:02:11.031 --> 00:02:14.630
and then I just couldn't do it anymore. So I decided to just take a break.

34
00:02:14.631 --> 00:02:19.130
Right. I took a break, but that made it even worse, I guess.

35
00:02:19.131 --> 00:02:23.360
It's because I had time to think about my life or like my decision, my choices.

36
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.250
And then for some reason, I just,

37
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.870
I just start to get really sad and starting to doubt myself,

38
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.530
doubt my confidence. Like I started like losing confidence.

39
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.850
I was doubting my job. I was doubting my videos. I was doubting me as a person.

40
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.490
Then it was kind of like this vicious circle that made me like more and more the

41
00:02:43.491 --> 00:02:46.940
gut. Like, I don't want to say it, but like, it made me feel like depressed,

42
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.880
right? Like, um, I Googled some symptoms and like, like, you know,

43
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.060
why is it so hard to wake up? Uh, feel like nothing is funny anymore.

44
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.180
And then they're like, oh man, that's the symptoms of depression.

45
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.510
I don't want to say it's depression. Like, I don't think I have it,

46
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.610
but maybe it's just like a sadness thing.

47
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:09.820
But I also don't like using that word because maybe like,

48
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.260
you know, I, I feel like I'm using it sparingly and like,

49
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.090
and also because it makes it more real, you know, if I use that word, but,

50
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.830
but basically I feel like,

51
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.470
I feel like I haven't been myself in a while and I

52
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:34.300
really miss like six months ago where, where everything was great. You know,

53
00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:38.710
I love my job, you know, I, I love making videos. I love entertaining you guys.

54
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:40.480
I love interacting with you guys.

55
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.280
And I thought the solution of my burnout was to, okay, let's take a chill.

56
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.570
And then I started, you know, not commenting as much. I started,

57
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.470
I started not like I didn't post on my social media as anymore.

58
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.240
I started posting less videos and that I also had like all these like sponsored

59
00:03:58.241 --> 00:04:01.360
videos that I had to do, but I really didn't want to do them.

60
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.100
But I had to write is like a contract. So I still did them,

61
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.600
but, but I told myself like, oh, after doing them,

62
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.850
I could finally make videos I want to make. But by that time, like,

63
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.950
I just didn't feel like myself anymore. Right. I felt, I felt,

64
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.580
I don't feel confident. I didn't find joy making videos anymore,

65
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.520
or at least like, it was so hard for me to start because it's,

66
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.500
I feel like it's something that I haven't done in a while.

67
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.913
<v 1>No.</v>

68
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.380
<v 0>And now I'm like, I'm just trying to get back into being myself.</v>

69
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.240
And it seems permanent. Like, honestly, like,

70
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.790
it seems really permanent, like what I'm feeling right now,

71
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.930
but I know it's not like I know it's not, but yeah.

72
00:04:48.931 --> 00:04:53.370
That's how I feel right now. And it sucks because like, you know,

73
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.190
in my mind, it's like, oh man, I'm not posting the videos.

74
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.510
I'm just going to become irrelevant and stuff like that. But I mean,

75
00:05:00.511 --> 00:05:04.270
I got to fix myself first. Right. Like it's, I don't,

76
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.280
I put these artificial stress on me and then it just becomes so sad.

77
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.270
Yeah. I'm sorry. You guys have to hear this, but

78
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.160
I mean, I there's a lot of things I missed, you know,

79
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.960
discord chats, my life videos. Those were really fun.

80
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.670
All the memes that I made of like the hints in water memes.

81
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:31.740
I really missed those.

82
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.310
<v 1>Yeah. Wow.</v>

83
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.850
<v 0>But yeah, I mean,</v>

84
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.550
I guess that's why I wanted to tell you guys just a little update of my life.

85
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.710
Um, I really want to make more videos, but I mean,

86
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.230
with my mood right now, it's kind of really hard.

87
00:05:49.231 --> 00:05:53.610
I feel like I have to inform me. I have to be in a very good state, you know,

88
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:58.460
like a very happy state to kind of like make videos. Cause like, you know,

89
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.280
when you're so sad and like kind of depressed,

90
00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:04.670
it's kind of really hard to force yourself to make certain things or at least

91
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:08.620
seem happy. But yeah. I mean,

92
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.210
I think that's it. That's what I want to tell you guys, but

93
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.490
I don't know. Anyways, thanks for watching. Um,

94
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:24.460
yeah.
