00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.290
<v 0>Previously on startup.</v>

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.880
I founded a startup called not fine.com where you can share 6.1 second videos.

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.150
I then brought in through my friends to help me build the most innovative video

4
00:00:09.151 --> 00:00:09.984
platform.

5
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.740
And I met up with Aria who secretly hate each other and constantly compare Dick

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.310
size. We just sold the other company. I'm just relaxing.

7
00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:22.190
Now I'm trying to figure out what to do next. Yeah,

8
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.550
I'm excited, but I'm also afraid.

9
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.090
It's just getting really hard, you know,

10
00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:33.590
managing all these relationships at once. It's getting too hard.

11
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.810
What excites you about the relationship you have with your employees? Wait,

12
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.770
what? No, I was talking to my Tinder relationship. God never listen to me,

13
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.470
but to be honest, I just can't get Ari off my mind.

14
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.410
Who's Aria. Oh, he's, he's just some startup founder. Uh,

15
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.350
we recently played chess, chess, startup, founder.

16
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.860
I think it means more to you than that.

17
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.000
We used to be best friends,

18
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.930
but then things changed.

19
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.350
Things really changed.

20
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.513
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

21
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.880
<v 0>Can you tell me a little bit about your relationship with Joma? You know,</v>

22
00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:38.870
we were friends then best friends, even how'd you guys meet?

23
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.010
He was in the study room, struggling with a simple assignment,

24
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.530
but I knew he was smarter than that. He came up to me, offering his help.

25
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.730
Thank God, because I just couldn't focus.

26
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.140
I was about to give up something else was consuming him.

27
00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.810
I could see that he was pretty broken at the time.

28
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.120
So I thought I could bring him under my wing.

29
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.290
I gave him a better place to stay better resources, better contacts,

30
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.670
a better life. Nobody wanted to give them a chance,

31
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.230
but I saw the potential in him.

32
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.170
He was kind to me extremely kind. I didn't serve it.

33
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.850
He let me stay with him in this apartment. She gave me my own room.

34
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.300
He even got me all the textbooks I needed for school.

35
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.680
He really took me out of the times. You know,

36
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.150
even guided me through my academic career without him,

37
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.040
I would have been lost.

38
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.290
He's the reason why I am quiet today from algorithms that

39
00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:46.100
statistics to cryptocurrencies, he taught me everything.

40
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.040
He made sure I knew the right things.

41
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.370
He made sure I succeeded. Okay.

42
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.090
So one thing we can do is with binary search would have been nothing without me.

43
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.820
Oh, it was internships.

44
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.900
<v 1>He got those through me except Microsoft. That was more him.</v>

45
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.780
That's thoughtful. I wanted the best for him. I really did.

46
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.980
I did everything I could for him until the incident.

47
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.370
What happened should have known so stupid.

48
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.910
I just couldn't face the truth.

49
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.900
I don't know. He's changed.

50
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.470
You speak kind and warm.

51
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.790
But I think one day I just realized that he wasn't self this person.

52
00:03:57.791 --> 00:04:02.560
I thought he was even kicked me out the house.

53
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.420
I mean, I appreciate everything he's done for me. Let me come on, man.

54
00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:10.270
What the was I supposed to call you? Add nothing.

55
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.360
I should know people like him. They don't have people like me.

56
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.810
How did you feel? It was humiliating.

57
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.750
I miss Aria. I really do.

58
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.540
You mean if he had exterior motives to bring me in? I was really happy.

59
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.580
I still don't know what he wanted from me, but offset and have it

60
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.950
just pushed me away. I didn't ask why. I mean,

61
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.840
I didn't deserve his kindness,

62
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.360
but things just got worse and that's where he crossed the line.

63
00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.670
Never confronted him about it because it just wouldn't matter.

64
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.370
One is apology. I just want it to break.

65
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.330
Can feel the pain that I felt until he's completely broken,

66
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.270
can regret everything that he did.

67
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.473
All right guys.

68
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.460
So today I paid a consultant to make this video for us.

69
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.740
Um, it's going to tell us, you know, how to think about MVPs. So what's the,

70
00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.130
you mean.

71
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.730
<v 0>Like LeBron wait,</v>

72
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.550
what's the brawn. Oh, he's the MVP.

73
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.500
All right, whatever. All right, let's just play the video.

74
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.290
<v 2>So the biggest problem that startups run into is creating something that nobody</v>

75
00:06:14.291 --> 00:06:18.460
wants to buy this waste years of work and thousands of dollars only to leave you

76
00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:22.600
broken unemployed, just like a college degree. So to stop this from happening,

77
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.380
I thought I'd go over the concept of an MVP and how this can help you grow your

78
00:06:26.381 --> 00:06:28.690
company. So what is an MVP?

79
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.840
This often gets confused with most valuable player,

80
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.650
but I think that comparison is kind of unfair because if you're trying to start

81
00:06:35.651 --> 00:06:38.500
a startup, chances are you have zero athletic ability.

82
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.670
Instead MVP here. It means a minimum viable product,

83
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.000
a rough version of your idea that takes a minimal amount of effort,

84
00:06:46.001 --> 00:06:49.090
but it's still good enough that users can get a taste of the full product,

85
00:06:49.091 --> 00:06:52.930
similar to how dating someone is sort of a taste of what marriage will be like.

86
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.950
And in my case, I've been told, I tastes like insecurity and an absentee father.

87
00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.060
Now, the reason you want to build an MVP is because it lets you learn what your

88
00:07:01.061 --> 00:07:03.850
customers like. And don't like as quickly as possible.

89
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.020
This is a pretty important concept because 90% of startups fail because they

90
00:07:08.021 --> 00:07:10.090
have no clue what their customers want.

91
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:13.480
Like this one time I was sitting at McDonald's and thought of a really good app

92
00:07:13.481 --> 00:07:17.230
idea, it involved a dating app where girls would choose guys based only on their

93
00:07:17.231 --> 00:07:20.440
personality and finally give nice guys a fighting chance.

94
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.850
But then I asked myself, would I date someone based only on the personality?

95
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.340
I'll let you decide now. I'm sure you're wondering what an MVP looks like.

96
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.710
The answer to that depends on what you're trying to build.

97
00:07:32.711 --> 00:07:35.830
So I thought it'd be helpful to show a few real life examples.

98
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.980
Let's say you wanted to build an app where people could store and share files

99
00:07:38.981 --> 00:07:41.620
online. You could do one of two things. One,

100
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:45.730
quit your job and spend years trying to make the app yourself or to hire someone

101
00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:49.450
to create a 32nd video of what that app would look like and show it to investors

102
00:07:49.451 --> 00:07:53.920
for millions of dollars while option one sounds attractive. The MVP here is too.

103
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.780
And that's what Dropbox did. Well.

104
00:07:55.781 --> 00:07:58.450
Let's say you want it to figure out if a girl or guy liked you.

105
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:02.110
Your MVP here would be a small, low pressure invite. Like, Hey,

106
00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.230
I'm going out to dinner with friends. Do you want to come along?

107
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.880
We're grabbing pizza, smiley face. And a few things can happen here. One,

108
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.900
she won't respond to you too. She says something short like haha,

109
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.710
or LOL or three. She says, no, I thought I told you,

110
00:08:17.711 --> 00:08:19.690
I'm not interested when this happens.

111
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.240
You might try to convince yourself that she's still into you,

112
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:26.770
but chances are she is into you. So just wait a few days and try again.

113
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:30.370
So by now you're probably wondering how to actually build an MVP.

114
00:08:30.371 --> 00:08:32.680
And that's exactly what I'm going to show you. Now,

115
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.560
the steps I'll be outlining my team simple at first,

116
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.980
but there's a bit of math involved, so you'll need to pay close attention.

117
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.300
And just before we start,

118
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.570
I thought I should mention that these steps are approved by the international

119
00:08:43.571 --> 00:08:45.220
board of startup venture capitalists,

120
00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:48.160
which means rest assured it's coming from a source of authority.

121
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:49.540
So without further ado,

122
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:54.550
here are the steps to building your first MVP step one don't we have enough

123
00:08:54.551 --> 00:08:55.384
startups.

124
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.780
<v 1>So I hope that was helpful and best of luck in your startup journey.</v>

125
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:14.453
All right. So what do you guys think.

126
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:17.360
<v 0>We need to start off by building our backend infrastructure.</v>

127
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.710
We can leverage Amazon CDNs load balancers and Lambdas modularize our

128
00:09:21.711 --> 00:09:25.160
infrastructure by using microservices so that we can set up elastic scaling and

129
00:09:25.161 --> 00:09:27.290
save money. I don't think we should do that.

130
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:29.570
This the most cost efficient solution. Well,

131
00:09:29.571 --> 00:09:33.110
we don't even know if we're going to get that many users. It's a total overkill.

132
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.240
Yes. It might save some capital,

133
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.780
but development time is our most limited resource and we can't waste time

134
00:09:38.781 --> 00:09:42.830
thinking about scalability on an MVP right now, our most limited resources,

135
00:09:42.831 --> 00:09:44.660
my patients with your ideas,

136
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.140
why can we just have a Facebook page and let people post their videos there and

137
00:09:48.141 --> 00:09:52.100
see if that grows. That's actually a really good,

138
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.520
good and smart MVP. But for the sake of this web series,

139
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.470
we have to do something more complicated. All right.

140
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.470
So here's what we're going to do. Wait, what do you have the final thing?

141
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.570
Because I went to Waterloo.

142
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.260
All right. Here's the thing. So as an MVP,

143
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.480
we're just going to make a purely consumption site.

144
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:14.810
The reason why is because we want to validate if there's actually demand for our

145
00:10:14.811 --> 00:10:17.720
website. So that's why we're just going to make a simple weapon.

146
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.110
What we'll do is that we'll pretend that it's invite only to be able to produce

147
00:10:21.111 --> 00:10:24.470
on our platform. But in reality, we don't have a production side,

148
00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:25.910
but we're really going to do it.

149
00:10:25.911 --> 00:10:29.480
It's just that when it's still old find videos and post them on our website,

150
00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.810
that way the consumer side will think that we're producing videos using the

151
00:10:32.811 --> 00:10:35.720
mobile app, which is invite them for growth.

152
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:38.990
We'll have a Facebook page and we'll put only the best of the best find videos

153
00:10:38.991 --> 00:10:42.530
there. And then we'll just boost the out of it with ad credits. All right.

154
00:10:42.531 --> 00:10:43.364
So here's what we need.

155
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.010
We need someone to build the whole web app front and backend.

156
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.840
We don't have enough resource to separate them.

157
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.560
That's why we need someone to own the whole full stack. I'm on it. All right.

158
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.500
He wants to ride the caller to get all the best find videos and then write

159
00:10:54.501 --> 00:10:58.130
pipelines, funneled them into our website. Got it. John Kane, right?

160
00:10:58.131 --> 00:11:00.320
The fake landing page for the mobile website. And also,

161
00:11:00.321 --> 00:11:04.040
can you set up the CVN so we can survey those faster and I'll manage to Facebook

162
00:11:04.041 --> 00:11:06.860
page and start growing it. All right. Let's do it.

163
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:19.303
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

164
