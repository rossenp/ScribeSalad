WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.420
<v 1>Yeah, man. It was not my finest hour,</v>

2
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.820
but I got wrecked by Amazon.

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.860
This interview actually happened a while ago when I was just first starting out

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.960
to interview for all these bank companies. Oh. And when, I mean Fang, I mean,

5
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.890
Fang, Todd, and I'm not going to say fan group Todd all the time,

6
00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:25.170
so I'm just going to say Fang. So when I say Fang,

7
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.470
think of a big tech companies anyways. Yeah.

8
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.380
So I got an onsite interview.

9
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.560
I went there and then I bombed it.

10
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:39.583
<v 0>Amazon.</v>

11
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.800
<v 1>By the way. Thank you so much audible for spawn. No, I'm just kidding then.</v>

12
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.150
But uh, but I do want you to watch this trailer of my startup series.

13
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.193
Check it out.

14
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.100
<v 0>So we've got this vision. Can you talk to me a little bit more about that?</v>

15
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.390
Like what is your startup idea? Yeah, it's a

16
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.140
present you not vine.com a platform to share a

17
00:01:06.141 --> 00:01:08.600
6.1 second long looping videos.

18
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.790
It's a website that you can upload and it's a mobile.

19
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.570
What do you think about this are pretty dominant, to be honest,

20
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.670
thinking about scalability on MVP right now are mostly my patients with

21
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.170
George ideas. I am the most qualified person for this job. I get done.

22
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.083
No we can't launch,

23
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.890
but to be honest, I just can't get Ari off my mind.

24
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.680
Who's Aria hate that guy.

25
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.550
So you still working for Microsoft? So what about you?

26
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.190
Where are you up there? I'll make him feel the pain

27
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.520
until he's completely broken.

28
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.810
<v 1>All right. Back to the Amazon interview.</v>

29
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.310
I just want to tell you guys quickly play by play what exactly happened,

30
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.240
because it might be useful for you guys who want to apply to Amazon.

31
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.960
So I got an Amazon referral from one of my friends and, uh, yeah,

32
00:02:35.961 --> 00:02:40.100
that's actually basically how I applied to jobs nowadays so that I could skip

33
00:02:40.101 --> 00:02:42.320
the line using the referral. So yeah.

34
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.940
Make sure you make friends in college because it's really important after a day

35
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.420
or two. Um, I got a coding assessment.

36
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.640
It was a two coding question challenge and they give you 90 minutes to do it.

37
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.060
And I had to sign some sort of a confidential agreement.

38
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.210
So I can't really share you the questions,

39
00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:03.550
but I could kind of tell you it's basically, uh,

40
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.870
easy slash medium questions and um, yeah, that's it.

41
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.390
There's also a section that is like,

42
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.070
describe your approach where you just write about how you did your question and

43
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:16.000
what was your approach.

44
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.260
And then there's also a section that's kind of like behavioral. Um, well,

45
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.850
I mean, they call it a survey,

46
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:24.160
but I think it's actually just a behavioral portion.

47
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.770
So of course I passed it because I've seen the questions already now. Kidding.

48
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.650
Am I? I don't know. I'm kidding. Am I? I don't know. No, I'm good. I'm good.

49
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.490
I didn't see. After I passed a coding assessment, uh,

50
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.110
I actually didn't get a phone interview.

51
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.040
I just talked to the recruiter and they sent me right away for an onsite,

52
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.160
which is kind of interesting. Yeah.

53
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.420
So onto the onsite here is how I up

54
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.710
immediately.

55
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.660
I went to the Amazon office in San Francisco and I went there pretty early.

56
00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.970
I think I went there maybe 10 minutes early.

57
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.750
Now you really want to go there early because it's an interview.

58
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.970
You don't want to be late. So it's pretty important.

59
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.130
And also you might want to drink some water,

60
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.010
go to the bathroom right beforehand. So that's pretty important.

61
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.330
So then I went to the lobby and I checked in and then I asked for the person

62
00:04:15.331 --> 00:04:18.240
that needs to come down to get me. I just sat in the lobby,

63
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.920
waiting and waiting and waiting. And, and then,

64
00:04:22.921 --> 00:04:27.330
because I was paranoid, uh, two minutes before the scheduled time interview,

65
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.000
I checked my phone and then I realized,

66
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.720
I asked the wrong person to come to the front desk.

67
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.180
It's okay. It's okay. I fixed it. I went back to the front desk and I fixed it.

68
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.450
No biggie, no problem. I would sat back down five minutes,

69
00:04:42.451 --> 00:04:46.260
go by 10 minutes, go by. And still,

70
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.410
no one was picking me up. I thought they were just late or something.

71
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.570
So check my phone. And I was like, I was in the wrong building.

72
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.730
So I sprinted to the right building and I was already 15 minutes late by then.

73
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.460
And then it took another five minutes to get the first interviewer.

74
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.540
And when he came, he, he asked me, you just, uh,

75
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.480
you just flew here this morning? Nope. Oh, so,

76
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.790
so you flew in yesterday? Yeah. Traffic is pretty bad, right? I mean,

77
00:05:14.791 --> 00:05:19.470
SF is crazy. Uh, no traffic was fine.

78
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.130
Did, uh, did we put you in a hotel that was really far or something?

79
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.790
No. Um, I actually live here, like in the Bay area.

80
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.640
Yeah. And he just stared at me.

81
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.380
He was trying to hide his disappointment and then I just said, yeah,

82
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.510
um, I was in the wrong building. Um, I got kind of confused,

83
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:43.523
sorry.

84
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.050
So we went into the interview room and he sat me down and he started asking me

85
00:05:49.051 --> 00:05:52.230
about my resume. He started asking me about, you know,

86
00:05:52.231 --> 00:05:56.100
why I wanted to switch back into SWE. And when I was done explaining,

87
00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.740
he was like, okay, let me talk about myself a little bit.

88
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.750
Here's what I do at Amazon. It's like, Holy, dude. I don't have time, man.

89
00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.390
I'm already 15 minutes late. Just give me the coding question.

90
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.000
I didn't actually say that. But that's what I was thinking.

91
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.510
Like on the exterior, I was more like, Oh, fascinating.

92
00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.830
That is quite a difficult problem. How does your team tackle this? Anyways,

93
00:06:17.831 --> 00:06:22.450
he took his sweet time and I ended up only getting like 20 minutes for the

94
00:06:22.451 --> 00:06:27.400
actual coding interview. I mean, I did. Okay. Uh, I got the optimal solution.

95
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:28.870
I was able to code it up,

96
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.160
but my code had some bugs here and there and I was able to fix it while I was

97
00:06:33.161 --> 00:06:36.760
debugging my code. But you know, I was kind of messy.

98
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.330
I didn't explain my thought process very well because I was,

99
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.980
I was pretty stressed with time. Right.

100
00:06:41.981 --> 00:06:46.210
So I wasn't able to perform like I would have if I had more time,

101
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.080
to be honest though,

102
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.650
I'm not a hundred percent sure that is the reason why they failed me.

103
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.190
It could be theater interviews too, or specifically one other one.

104
00:06:54.191 --> 00:06:57.250
I'll talk about that later. Anyway. So then I had, uh,

105
00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.730
four more of those interviews because, uh,

106
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:05.560
in total they have five interviews, usually it's for coding and one,

107
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.890
uh, system design. Well, at least that's what I had. So yeah,

108
00:07:08.891 --> 00:07:11.740
it's a long day and you get tired by the end of the day,

109
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.420
the four coding questions were mostly easy to mediumly code questions.

110
00:07:16.421 --> 00:07:18.190
So those weren't that bad.

111
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:23.260
I did decently on them because I practice Lee code and I wouldn't say

112
00:07:23.261 --> 00:07:25.480
I aced them, but I,

113
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.920
I did solve most of the questions optimally, but sometimes I need a hint.

114
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.730
And also sometimes, uh, my code had some bugs in there,

115
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.270
like maybe even typos. So it wasn't flawless.

116
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:41.680
Also each of these interviews, they actually have a behavioral portion.

117
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:46.210
The thing about Amazon is that they have something called the 14 leadership

118
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.310
principles and basically what you have to do,

119
00:07:48.311 --> 00:07:49.750
you just have to memorize all of it.

120
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.230
And then when they asked you behavioral questions,

121
00:07:53.231 --> 00:07:57.730
you have to exhibit these principles, exhibit these leadership principles.

122
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.110
So think about your past experiences or, or just make it up, whatever,

123
00:08:02.111 --> 00:08:02.944
I don't care.

124
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.990
And they have to demonstrate those leadership principles. I think I did.

125
00:08:07.991 --> 00:08:12.760
Okay. Because of my silver tongue or actually more like bronze tongue,

126
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.490
maybe like copper, copper tongue, you know what, nevermind.

127
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:19.450
I don't think I did that well in the behavioral portion,

128
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:20.950
I can't even say behavioral.

129
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:26.590
And then I also had one system design interview and I think that's the

130
00:08:26.591 --> 00:08:31.450
interview that I got screwed on because I didn't practice system interviews that

131
00:08:31.451 --> 00:08:34.360
much. So I think that's why I failed.

132
00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:37.270
So I just wanted to share this story with you guys,

133
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:42.250
because I want you to know that interviewing can be

134
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:46.150
a game of luck. I mean, I felt for valid reasons,

135
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.530
but there are many times that you will fell an interview and you're going to

136
00:08:50.531 --> 00:08:52.900
feel like. I mean, I felt like,

137
00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:58.590
but it might've just been luck because a few months

138
00:08:58.591 --> 00:09:03.180
later I'd say that I got offers from companies that

139
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.580
I wanted to work for even more. So you never know. I mean,

140
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:13.410
sometimes it's just a numbers game. It's pretty random.

141
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.750
I want to end this video on this note,

142
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.610
your interview performance says nothing about you.

143
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.650
It says nothing about your worth. It says nothing about your intelligence.

144
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.570
And it says nothing about how good of a software engineer you are.

145
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:34.290
Heck I got a few good offers from these big tech companies,

146
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.230
but I don't think I'm that great of a software engineer.

147
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.810
I'm just good at interviewing. It doesn't mean anything.

148
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.890
I'm sure many of you are better software engineers than I am,

149
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.840
but it's just that these interviews can really bring you down and make you lose

150
00:09:48.841 --> 00:09:52.320
confidence, man, don't lose confidence in yourself,

151
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:56.580
especially because of an interview. Keep practicing, keep getting better.

152
00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:01.440
You won't see huge differences overnight getting these three

153
00:10:01.441 --> 00:10:05.760
offers. It's it's a marathon. It's not a sprint. Not going to lie.

154
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:10.380
When I got that rejection, I was pretty depressed. I told,

155
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.620
I told myself if I can't even get this offer,

156
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.500
how am I going to get the other job offers that I want,

157
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:21.210
how am I going to switch from data science to sweet? It feels bad at first.

158
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:26.250
And it feels like it's going to be forever, but it's not in hindsight.

159
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.300
I realized how silly it was for me to think these things,

160
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:35.130
because now I got, I got my dream job. I'm doing great at it.

161
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:39.870
And I feel confident and like, I love my teammates. It's great.

162
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.830
Sometimes failures can be blessings in disguise,

163
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:49.140
so don't dwell on your failures, but use them to grow.

164
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.080
All right. So that's it. And uh, yeah,

165
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.750
don't forget to check out daily interview pool.com.

166
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.690
We send you one coding question per day,

167
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.860
so you can keep practicing and keep yourself accountable. When I was, uh,

168
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.330
studying for all these interviews,

169
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.990
I made sure that I did at least one question a day.

170
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:11.370
So that's pretty important. It's a marathon. It's not a sprint, but that's it.
