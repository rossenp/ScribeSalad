1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.190
<v 0>So what happened to your startup?</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.050
<v 1>Well, I took a break cause, uh, that's some other priorities going on. Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:07.051 --> 00:00:10.410
I want to work on personal development, you know, building relationship,

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.500
networking, and also just overall learning more.

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.340
And while I was doing that, uh,

6
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.050
had to look over to my old hard drives because I want to find some important

7
00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:24.060
documents and some important notes.

8
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.390
And I found something pretty interesting.

9
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.210
And when I clicked into it, you know, I just opened up the wallet and I'll,

10
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.530
and there it is. And then it hit me. I remembered, you know,

11
00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:42.030
I used to mind Bitcoins. It was probably like five, five or six years ago.

12
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.210
I remember trying to get enough so that I could buy a pizza slice,

13
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.300
but I just couldn't get enough. I mean, I think he had,

14
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.830
I think he needed like 10,000 Bitcoins to get a slice of pizza, but yeah.

15
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.850
Only had like a hundred something, but I'm going to check the price.

16
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.890
And I was like, well, yeah. And I said to myself, my God,

17
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.990
what do I do with all that money? It's crazy. All of the things I can buy,

18
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.630
but then I remembered I live in Silicon Valley. All I can afford a new house.

19
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.260
Yeah. I guess I'm a homeowner now, but I mean,

20
00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:23.400
I ran out of money, so I have to start making money again. But yeah.

21
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.300
So that's why I'm back.

22
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.850
<v 0>[Inaudible] the pitch.</v>

23
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.820
<v 2>One of the most important aspect of your startup,</v>

24
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.530
no matter how great your ideas,

25
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.110
if you can't convey it and you don't have any capital,

26
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.540
then your startup is useless.

27
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.320
And if you can inspire people and you don't have a team already working for you,

28
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.260
then your startup is a useless. But wait,

29
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.950
what if I can make a product that doesn't require much capital and I don't need

30
00:01:54.951 --> 00:01:57.740
a team, I could do it by myself. Well, I mean,

31
00:01:57.741 --> 00:01:59.930
if you can't convey your idea to customers,

32
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.640
then you're not going to have any customers.

33
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.690
And if you don't have any customers, then your startup is useless.

34
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.810
Every interaction relating to your startup,

35
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.000
you will somehow require to pitch it.

36
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.480
Now that is why it is essential to perfect.

37
00:02:14.481 --> 00:02:17.540
Your pitch easier said than done.

38
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.230
Here are the seven questions that you should answer as clearly as possible.

39
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.430
With these in mind,

40
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.660
you'll be able to do ten second pitches to a five minute presentation with demo.

41
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.820
Number one, what do you do? Be as clear as possible. No fluff,

42
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.080
no to test it. The email tests write two sentences,

43
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.700
describing your startup in an email,

44
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.290
send it to a competent friend and ask them to re-explain to you with his own

45
00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:46.220
words. If they can do that, then you're golden. Number two.

46
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.030
How big is the market? Investors care about ROI.

47
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.150
If there's no market for a product, then their investment isn't worth it.

48
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.410
Don't make your target market too wide or too narrow. Make it correct.

49
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.080
You're only wasting people's time. If you're making up numbers, number three,

50
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.370
what's your progress.

51
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.800
They want to make sure you guys are actually doing something.

52
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.700
What is possible in a given timeframe? What can you do?

53
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.410
Number four. What's your unique insight or in some sense,

54
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.000
what's your competitive advantage?

55
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.490
How are you different than the startup next door?

56
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.750
What makes you more likely to succeed in your market? Number five,

57
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.330
what's your business model? How are we going to make money?

58
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.050
Are you the grow fast? Think about money later kind of company,

59
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.910
or would you be making money right away?

60
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.630
It's always better to have a plan of attack when it comes to monetization.

61
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.360
Number six, who's on your team. What are your credentials? Who's technical.

62
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.650
Who's not, who's doing what is everyone useful? Are you as lean as possible?

63
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.290
Number seven, what do you want?

64
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.200
This can be capital convincing someone to work for you,

65
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.530
or simply to tell your mom that you're actually doing something and that you're

66
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:55.810
not wasting her life savings on your pet projects.

67
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.430
And that this time it's gonna blow up.

68
00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:58.743
<v 0>For sure.</v>

69
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.900
<v 2>Once you have these answered now compress it into 30 seconds. Here's my,</v>

70
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.600
My surf is called not fine.com platform to create and share 6.1 second,

71
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.200
looping videos. We have a market size of at least 200 million.

72
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.170
Given the fact that a similar product has just left this market.

73
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.430
I made no progress. I understand the market, both consumer and producer.

74
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.640
I've been working in the publishing industry for over five months,

75
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.790
which makes me an expert in social media and media publishing.

76
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.360
You can monetize through advertisement, branded content and presets posts.

77
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.710
I am currently the only one on my team and I want you to join my startup.

78
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.583
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

79
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.640
<v 0>[Inaudible] but.</v>

80
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.020
<v 3>What's your background? Oh, just worked on a couple of startups.</v>

81
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.300
Um, mostly just like fitness related startups.

82
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.860
Uh he's my best friend's ex was the breakup like

83
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.890
pretty bad.

84
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.690
I mean, I'm sure John was still cries over it.

85
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.030
<v 0>Now you're all here because you're the best engineers.</v>

86
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.460
Now I need something from you guys.

87
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.840
And today I'm going to talk about my startup and here's my presentation,

88
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.130
velocity, compassion,

89
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.550
spirituality. What do all these things have in common?

90
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.980
I present to you.

91
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.020
<v 1>Not vine.com</v>

92
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.970
a platform to share 6.1 second long looping videos.

93
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.900
<v 4>Oh, you know, I love him, man. You know, vine was w bine was awesome,</v>

94
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.300
but not vine. It's going to be bad. It's going to be way better.

95
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.410
<v 1>Excited. Uh, I don't know.</v>

96
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.540
<v 3>Pretty dumb to be honest.</v>

97
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.450
<v 4>Do they started by using utterly ridiculous.</v>

98
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.090
I created four startups by the time I was 18.

99
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.390
I can build that back end infrastructure during an episode of Battlestar

100
00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:32.224
Galactica.

101
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.220
<v 1>Well, I'm just a Bubba delivery guy, but you know, when I saw the slides,</v>

102
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:37.330
I thought it was pretty cool.

103
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.100
Do you want me to say it's like a pretty cool seat?

104
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.970
<v 4>Well, how to dream, that's going to be like really, really successful.</v>

105
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.390
And then after that I had another dream about taco bell and Wendy's creating

106
00:06:46.391 --> 00:06:50.320
like a burrito burger. So all in all, I'm really excited about it.

107
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.840
<v 1>Would you work for that startup? Oh dude. No.</v>

108
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.350
And what else? It's also eight mobile now.

109
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:00.940
<v 3>Oh, I think it's great.</v>

110
00:07:00.941 --> 00:07:05.500
I love vine and always been checking those videos and being on it. Yeah.

111
00:07:05.501 --> 00:07:07.210
I think it's awesome that they're bringing it back.

112
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.920
<v 1>You do realize it's not vine. Right? Right.</v>

113
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.780
What opportunities research shows that there was a similar product.

114
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.390
<v 4>That reached 200 million active users.</v>

115
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.040
<v 1>On December, 2015.</v>

116
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.310
But that product is no longer in the market and left a need. Unsatisfying.

117
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:29.050
That is where we come in.

118
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.250
<v 4>This thing is a complete and utter scam. It's not like Bitcoin,</v>

119
00:07:33.251 --> 00:07:36.760
which is legitimate. It's like dumb like queen or a theory of,

120
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.850
I would never pay it launch roadmaps though.

121
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.500
<v 3>Oh yeah. He likes, uh, he's one of my followers he's followed me on Instagram,</v>

122
00:07:44.501 --> 00:07:47.140
Twitter, Snapchat.

123
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.060
And then one day he just like messaged me and yeah, we started talking. Um,

124
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.090
yeah, I think his handle is, uh,

125
00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:00.040
at Joma OPA that's J O M a

126
00:08:00.041 --> 00:08:01.040
O P P.

127
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.170
<v 1>And our main competitive advantage. Me.</v>

128
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:10.810
What do you think about gentleman as the CEO?

129
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:16.330
<v 3>Oh yeah. He's a really great friend. Jamal is a really bad boyfriend.</v>

130
00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.840
There was this one time when he forgot Christina's birthday,

131
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.740
because he was so immersed in watching vine videos.

132
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.990
<v 1>Doing work in research.</v>

133
00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:30.250
<v 4>Explain this for you, commonplace people. If this was star Trek,</v>

134
00:08:30.251 --> 00:08:34.240
the next generation, I would be commander data because I'm a genius.

135
00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:39.130
He would be Lieutenant ward because he's just running around and making stupid

136
00:08:39.131 --> 00:08:40.600
decisions all the time.

137
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.500
I bet Joma had to study off stack overflow to make it through a Microsoft

138
00:08:44.501 --> 00:08:48.040
interview. I would never work for the startup in a million years,

139
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:52.570
not even a million light years. And that's not even a time. It's a distance.

140
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:57.060
<v 1>Now what's their business model. Now we have a lot of sources of revenue.</v>

141
00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.460
We got advertisement 70%.

142
00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:02.180
<v 3>Right. Do you think you would work for them? Oh yeah. Sure. Man.</v>

143
00:09:02.181 --> 00:09:05.150
I'm just chilling right now, but I'll definitely work for them.

144
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.330
Do you have a job right now? You know, I'm in between jobs,

145
00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:16.370
you know, just in that in-between, uh,

146
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.290
my mom always says, I'm an entrepreneur.

147
00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.520
What's your criminal record

148
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:28.460
next step.

149
00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.670
<v 1>So what we need to do next, we need to create the iOS app.</v>

150
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:35.450
We need to make the backend a lot stronger and we need to innovate.

151
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.880
Don was a pretty good guy. He gets, Bubba was 100%.

152
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.850
<v 3>Sweetness, just like his heart, Joe mutt drinks,</v>

153
00:09:40.851 --> 00:09:43.580
his Boba with 100% sweetness.

154
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:48.980
<v 1>To manage all the marketing platforms. Any questions? Yeah.</v>

155
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.610
So what kind of people are looking for? Yeah, so I'm looking for like, uh,

156
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.840
flexible engineers and our engineers are pretty much full stack backend front

157
00:09:56.841 --> 00:10:00.110
end. If you're not afraid of touching all of these pieces of code, then. Yeah.

158
00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.240
You're definitely good for jobs. If you can do that.

159
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:07.940
There you go do with $420 and 69 cents.

160
00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.810
Yeah. That's a good question. I mean, I'll definitely invest in not bind.com.

161
00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.540
I mean, we need as much capital as we can, so yeah,

162
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.850
definitely invested any more questions.

163
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:26.510
Okay. Turn to camera. Hey, do you mind?

164
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:31.220
Can you stop interrupting? All right. Any more questions?

165
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:36.220
What's your tech stack? Well, um, what you, you know, like the, the,

166
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:41.200
the mean stack. Yeah. I mean, we could do the nice stack too. I mean, like it's,

167
00:10:41.201 --> 00:10:44.720
it's pretty flexible right now. Yeah. So I mean, nice stack means that,

168
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.750
you know, it's all good. It depends on what you want, you know,

169
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.170
do you even code

170
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:58.730
of course, come on. I mean, have a CS degree.

171
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:05.510
<v 3>First of all, the name not fine. She's not going to work.</v>

172
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.690
And I don't know. I just wasn't listening honestly.

173
00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:17.180
<v 1>Do you think they liked your pitch? Of course not. I mean, I'm not stupid.</v>

174
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.030
I know what they're saying, but that's the thing not fine.

175
00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.570
It's just the marking scheme for something bigger.

176
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:31.370
