00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.580
isn't that cool? That's the only thing I can do. Look, I'm a,

8
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.290
I'm a data scientist. See the Coquitlam as a data scientist.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.630
I work in Silicon Valley. Okay. What's popping. Get data science.

10
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.910
Okay. It's about influence.

11
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.500
It's about being influential and data. Science is hard.

12
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.670
I'm the only person who seems to know how to do data science.

13
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.570
Now you guys should take a look at this is X a mirror, so you can see

14
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:29.780
what's that noise.

15
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.100
I thought I told you to be quiet. I'm trying to do a blog here.

16
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.770
My viewers demand quality and quality is what they will get.

17
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.533
<v 0>No. Where was that?</v>

18
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.240
<v 1>How's my hair. How's that work, but I still look good. Yeah.</v>

19
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.030
Want to make sure that I still look good so that I can do my flux here where

20
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.090
we're we what's that giving you? Let's take a look at how I look at the mirror.

21
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.620
It looks pretty good though. I really like the way my hair looks. Yeah,

22
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:11.203
it's nice.

23
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.123
<v 0>[Inaudible]</v>

24
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.550
okay. Wow. It's been a while.

25
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.800
I'm pretty rusty. So I'm going to get my iPad,

26
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.480
going to look at my notes. Okay.

27
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.290
All right. So the first thing that I want to say is that, um, I'm okay.

28
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.340
You know, I'm not dead.

29
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.000
<v 1>A lot of you thought it was dead, but I'm definitely okay. You know, I'm,</v>

30
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.440
I'm alive and, um, yeah, so you could stop worrying about me,

31
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.320
but, uh, I just want to say thank you so, so much for, for everyone. Uh,

32
00:03:13.321 --> 00:03:16.930
I know in the last video, you know, I was pretty depressed and stuff like that,

33
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.040
but, um, I'm, I'm, I'm very happy now. I'm very okay.

34
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.470
And I was very surprised in how much you guys cared and it was actually

35
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:30.940
quite touching and, uh, yeah, like a lot of, a lot of people reached out to me.

36
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.840
Uh, like even some YouTubers, they all reached out to me to see if I was okay.

37
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.940
So I'm super thankful for that. I really appreciate it. And,

38
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.980
um, yeah, honestly, it's one of the reasons why, you know, I got better.

39
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.850
So that's, that's really cool if you guys, so, um,

40
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.870
yeah, so I guess the title of this video was, um,

41
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.930
why that I stopped making videos. Well, as you know, you know,

42
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.150
I had like a burnout,

43
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.280
so th that was definitely a factor and I really needed to take some time to

44
00:04:03.281 --> 00:04:08.140
think about, you know, what I really wanted to do with my life, my career,

45
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.620
with the videos going forward. And, and yeah, and,

46
00:04:12.621 --> 00:04:16.300
and the reason why I had to think about all that was because, you know, I was,

47
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.410
you know, cause I had that catalyst and that catalyst was, you know,

48
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.560
the burnout and that catalyst really made me think about, you know,

49
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:24.610
my life in general.

50
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.650
And I had to rethink some things and basically, um,

51
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.030
it was kind of bad at the beginning because I had a lot of negativity going on

52
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:36.700
in my life that I was kind of imposing on myself,

53
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.570
some negativity and it was starting to turn kind of like a vicious cycle.

54
00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:43.510
I don't know if you guys ever had this thing where it's like, Oh, you know,

55
00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:46.120
for example, you're sad about one thing. And then because of that thing,

56
00:04:46.121 --> 00:04:48.910
you're sad about another thing. And then it gets worse and worse.

57
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.460
So I realized that, and then, yeah,

58
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.020
like I was very sad and I had to fix myself before that spiral

59
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.060
goes into something worse.

60
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.430
And one of the things I had to do was to take a break and that means, you know,

61
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:04.780
videos and other stuff.

62
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.160
And I want to focus on my mental health to remove a lot of these stressors.

63
00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:10.660
So I don't need to think about them.

64
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.680
So I could kind of look at my life at a more holistic view and that's pretty

65
00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:15.401
much what I did.

66
00:05:15.401 --> 00:05:20.020
So that's why I did not make videos for awhile because not going to lie,

67
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.640
that was kind of a stressor at that time. And,

68
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.960
um, and a lot of you, you know, thanks for caring. And you wanted to know like,

69
00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:31.600
how did I get out this rut? Or like, you know,

70
00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:35.920
how did I not be sad anymore? Um,

71
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.150
yeah. I mean, there's no simple answer for that.

72
00:05:40.151 --> 00:05:44.800
I think you truly have to find out for yourself some inner

73
00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:48.790
issues that you have that you haven't solved yet. Unfortunately for me,

74
00:05:48.791 --> 00:05:52.060
it's quite personal, so I'm not really like super comfortable sharing it.

75
00:05:52.061 --> 00:05:56.830
If you guys, I know I'm a YouTuber, but you know, there are some limits. And,

76
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.650
but then also like, while I was in that state,

77
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.420
there's also a time aspect to it. Like a lot of you guys told me that, you know,

78
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.040
a lot of people went through it and they told me that's not permanent. And,

79
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:14.450
and, and they're right, it's not permanent. And, um, basically, you know,

80
00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:17.330
time does heal, you know, and.

81
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.843
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

82
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.380
<v 1>Anyway. Yeah. So time does heal.</v>

83
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.360
<v 0>And it.</v>

84
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.400
<v 1>And yeah, so yeah, so it's, it's not permanent and time heals,</v>

85
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.360
but you also have to be kind of proactive into like trying to figure out why

86
00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:40.330
you're in a rut and stuff like that. I mean, for me, at least that's what I did.

87
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.870
So because I had to be proactive, you know,

88
00:06:43.871 --> 00:06:47.680
I did a lot of things that to try to help myself, you know, I went to therapy,

89
00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.310
I ran, I went to the gym a lot, you know, cause you know,

90
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.340
I read internet articles. I'm like, how, how do I stop being sad?

91
00:06:54.341 --> 00:06:57.100
And a lot of the times that's what they tell you to do. So is that all right?

92
00:06:57.101 --> 00:06:59.290
You know, so I started doing all of these things, you know,

93
00:06:59.291 --> 00:07:02.140
I stopped making videos. I kept moving.

94
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.460
I tried to create better relationships with my friends and then be more social,

95
00:07:06.461 --> 00:07:07.300
always keep moving.

96
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.970
Like it was really hard in the beginning cause you really don't want to do that.

97
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.400
You really don't want to do that, but I still did it, you know, because could,

98
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.450
cause I knew that it was going to be helpful in some ways or at least my

99
00:07:16.451 --> 00:07:21.130
therapist told me, you know, and um, also watched a lot of anime. Uh,

100
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.270
I think that helped, you know, I watch a lot of anime, you know,

101
00:07:25.271 --> 00:07:28.990
in case you're curious, it's uh, I watched a hero acadamia food Wars.

102
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.820
I'm also watching anatomy stuff too. Like Tara's house.

103
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:37.630
<v 0>Uh.</v>

104
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.770
<v 1>What else did I watch? Well, I watched psyche K psyche K is pretty like a,</v>

105
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:42.730
that was pretty funny.

106
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:49.450
<v 0>Uh, yeah, lots of anatomy anyways.</v>

107
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.143
Um,

108
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:59.310
and then after all that I kind of came. So then.

109
00:07:59.410 --> 00:07:59.981
<v 1>After all that,</v>

110
00:07:59.981 --> 00:08:04.540
I came to the conclusion that there was like a misalignment between my

111
00:08:04.541 --> 00:08:09.130
actions and my values, which was probably why it wasn't that happy.

112
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:14.200
Like I could talk about that maybe sometimes in the future,

113
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:18.720
but probably not now. And um, yeah, like, um, I,

114
00:08:18.721 --> 00:08:20.770
I may talk about it a little bit in the future,

115
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.200
but because now I kind of want to talk about, you know,

116
00:08:23.201 --> 00:08:27.130
switch gears and talk about something, something more positive, which is, um,

117
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.800
you know, what's next, what's next with me? Well,

118
00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:32.500
what's next with this channel mostly. Um,

119
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.050
I just want to say that a startup series,

120
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.920
a lot of people are waiting for a startup series. I will continue that. I mean,

121
00:08:38.921 --> 00:08:43.060
I do enjoy filming it. I love it making it, but it does take a lot of time.

122
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:47.380
So I mean, I still have a lot of ideas in the back of my mind and um,

123
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.190
I'm very excited, you know, whenever I sleep thinking about that.

124
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.580
So it's definitely, it's definitely coming hopefully.

125
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.860
And then as for the other videos, um, yeah,

126
00:08:58.861 --> 00:09:03.450
like in general there are probably going to be less videos coming out.

127
00:09:03.451 --> 00:09:06.270
Like I'll, I'll probably still make videos, but just less than before,

128
00:09:06.271 --> 00:09:09.150
because I don't want to make videos just for the sake of making videos,

129
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:14.250
you know? I mean, it's just, it's just less fun and then I'm pretty sure,

130
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.910
like it's less entertaining also. So I'm, so I'm just gonna, you know,

131
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:22.440
take my time more and making videos and um, yeah, because you know,

132
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:25.920
I have a lot of other things that I want to do right now that I haven't done

133
00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:29.670
before. So, so I might, yeah.

134
00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:32.970
So I just can't spend that much time on videos.

135
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.870
So anyways. Okay. What about,

136
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.850
what about what's next in my life?

137
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:44.640
So I am going to continue what I'm doing now, which was like, um, you know,

138
00:09:44.641 --> 00:09:48.240
getting a lot of social interactions and just being more sociable with

139
00:09:48.241 --> 00:09:50.760
developing my friendships and relationships.

140
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.900
I think that's pretty important for me right now and I'm pretty happy doing it,

141
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:59.880
so I'll probably prioritize that and then I'll have

142
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:03.360
also like other stuff going on in my life, some change and stuff like that,

143
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.170
but I decided to keep my life a little bit more private, you know, just for,

144
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:09.810
for some boundaries.

145
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.460
I think that is kind of important if we want to make this sustainable. So yeah.

146
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:19.290
Yes. Anyways, so that's pretty much it, so yeah.

147
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.220
Thanks so much again. Um, I really, really appreciate it. Every single comment,

148
00:10:23.221 --> 00:10:27.180
I almost read everything. Okay. Okay. I lied, but I read a lot of comments,

149
00:10:27.181 --> 00:10:32.100
you know, from, um, from the previous videos and I was so grateful and yeah,

150
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:36.900
very wholesome. Yeah. I really enjoyed it. And um, I really appreciate it.

151
00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:41.520
And uh, thank you. Thank you guys so much again, uh, I'm not very good at,

152
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:47.040
at making at saying these things, honestly, I'm like an awkward guy, but uh,

153
00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.670
I want to say is that you can stop messaging like son,

154
00:10:50.671 --> 00:10:55.050
me or my brother or like my UCOR everyone that's like around me,

155
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:59.310
if I'm okay or if I'm alive. So, um, yeah, thank you. But uh, yeah,

156
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:03.630
