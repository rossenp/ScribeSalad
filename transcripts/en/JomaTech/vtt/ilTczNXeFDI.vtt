00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.120
<v 0>And you want him in my blog. I'm pretty lit right now,</v>

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.550
but you kind of have to hide this all the time though.

3
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.020
What's up guys, Q and a time. So on Twitter,

4
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.920
Lucas asked me what is the best way to get into data science?

5
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.160
So I'll talk about data science analytics, because that's what I do.

6
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.540
I think the best way to get into data science analytics is what I did actually.

7
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.520
So first what I did is I majored in computer science in university of Waterloo.

8
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.960
And then what I did was I got an internship as a software engineer at LinkedIn.

9
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.610
And then I got a referral from a friend for a Facebook internship as a data

10
00:00:52.611 --> 00:00:56.120
scientist. And then when I got the internship at Facebook, I'm pretty much set.

11
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.380
Once you have that in your resume,

12
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.800
you can pretty much get almost any data science job. And to be honest,

13
00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:02.870
I didn't do any projects related to data science.

14
00:01:02.871 --> 00:01:06.170
I didn't even touch data science until I got that interview.

15
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.390
And when I did that interview, it was very,

16
00:01:08.391 --> 00:01:10.640
very simple because it was for an internship.

17
00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:14.390
So all they asked do was like probability questions and simple SQL question.

18
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.230
But there's one thing that I'm a little bit curious about is what did other

19
00:01:18.231 --> 00:01:20.360
people do because I'm pretty sure I'm just a very,

20
00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:22.550
very lucky human being that I got a referral.

21
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.420
So I want to see what other data scientists majored in because I've met a lot of

22
00:01:26.421 --> 00:01:28.430
different data scientists. And I'm pretty curious.

23
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.500
So let's go on LinkedIn and check that out.

24
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.240
So we got one data scientist here and she went to Harvard

25
00:01:35.241 --> 00:01:40.040
university, CS, Duke university, mathematics and economics.

26
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.760
So data scientists at Uber. So we got Duke university, PhD,

27
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.660
computational neuroscience and neurobiology, Stanford university,

28
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.680
master of science bioengineering. We got Spotify data scientist.

29
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.220
So university of California, Berkeley applied mathematics.

30
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.300
So data scientists at Yelp got MIT, bachelor degree,

31
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.600
electrical engineering and computer science, and then master degree,

32
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.830
electrical engineer and computer science. So I think we get the gist here.

33
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.100
Anything that is a technical, like engineering or math,

34
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.710
that is the best major to get into.

35
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.260
So I think you can't go wrong with computer science,

36
00:02:15.261 --> 00:02:17.330
engineering or math and statistics.

37
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.680
So today I have an offsite with my team and I'm going to log in and you might

38
00:02:21.681 --> 00:02:23.840
see someone that you recognize. So stay tuned

39
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.470
in my blog. I'm pretty lit right now

40
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.690
this all right. Why are you lit, man? You always good.

41
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.000
How's how's different. Brooklyn.

42
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.980
How does it feel to be the most good looking guy on the team?

43
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.923
Jeffrey Che,

44
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.000
how the did I know that? Nothing. Did you fall your neck?

45
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.060
Yeah. I fell down the stairs, hit the stairs multiple times and my neck.

46
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.670
I feel pretty good actually. Yeah.

47
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.290
[inaudible] yeah, this is literally the fifth sample you've taken off again.

48
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.180
Another Holy. No.

49
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.470
Are you looking to buy any beef?

50
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.990
[inaudible] Hey, excuse me. Can we have a refill?

51
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.660
You have to think about Instagram shirt. Is that it looks like a non biker.

52
00:03:33.661 --> 00:03:36.240
So every time I'm on campus, I see someone wearing down. I'm like, Oh.

53
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.260
It's not fine. It's my fan. But then not only Instagram. Yeah.

54
00:03:39.261 --> 00:03:42.660
I'm sure they copied you is your v-neck not deep enough.

55
00:03:42.661 --> 00:03:45.390
You have to put in sunglasses and assume that

56
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.950
you actually have cleavage because of your past what Andre was doing. Monetize.

57
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.860
All right. Let me just read my chlamydia to you. Yeah.

58
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.680
Flip shot. All right, let's go. Knock. You said you're good at everything.

59
00:04:04.681 --> 00:04:06.870
So of course anything. Hi, what are you good at?

60
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.810
Let, let, let, let let's see, Patrick. I bet he's going to get it.

61
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.780
Oh my God. Nope. It's impossible.

62
00:04:18.781 --> 00:04:20.850
I don't think this game is actually fun doing it. No again,

63
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.140
so originally we wanted to do a paintball match,

64
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.420
but then we realized we didn't have enough budget for that.

65
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:37.800
So we ended up doing this.

66
00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.180
No, God

67
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.370
checking his phone. Yeah. He's checking his phone.

68
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.913
Yeah.

69
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.060
My favorite thing about going to off-sites is seeing software engineers and

70
00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:15.330
their political abilities. So not only are they very good engineers,

71
00:05:15.331 --> 00:05:17.220
they are also very good spike ball players.

72
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.203
Oh, we do.

73
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.450
So I basically asked them what is one tip that helped them become the person

74
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.050
they are today. And you said, um,

75
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.960
anyways, so Sanjay, what do you want? What's yours. I got, I got,

76
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.330
yeah. It's better to find out things you don't like to do then.

77
00:05:42.331 --> 00:05:45.420
What things you like to do? Ooh, fascinating. That's true.

78
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.600
Any anecdote for you specifically? I was doing,

79
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.980
I did PR and marketing. Didn't really like it

80
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.120
found a bit of product and liked it. Got it. Okay. Um,

81
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.790
no risk equals reward.

82
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.110
So you don't need to take risks in life.

83
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.070
Like a lot of people who have started their companies, um,

84
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.420
they knew it was going to succeed already. And if you act like a CEO,

85
00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:18.260
they don't just bet their whole company on that random, risky idea.

86
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.610
Everything is planned out and success is off for guaranteed. So that's,

87
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.320
that's the way to do it. Fascinating, very related to the golden path and video.

88
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.450
Don't forget to buy season one of tech lead. It's only for $20, 1995,

89
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.090

93
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.750
Got to meet some awesome people like tech lead. Who's that?

94
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.140
