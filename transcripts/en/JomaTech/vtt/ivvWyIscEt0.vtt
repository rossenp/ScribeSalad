00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.390
<v 0>Yo what's up guys. So, um, it's pretty late right now,</v>

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.250
but there's this guy that wrote to me, he said that he worked as a Quanta,

3
00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:13.080
et cetera, and jump trading. So now I'm checking out his profile and.

4
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.690
<v 1>Smoking weed, sipping gin and juice by the hair, the caucus. She said,</v>

5
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.810
Oh, we medicated. But still as you,

6
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.780
Katie grew up in that. Oh wow. He goes to Harvard too.

7
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.800
[inaudible].

8
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.840
<v 0>Welcome to the show, dude. Um,</v>

9
00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:48.200
I'm not going to do like the typical intro because I want this to be more of a

10
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.330
casual conversation. Yeah. Yeah.

11
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.930
Thanks for using the microphone with the weird microphone stand. Yeah. Yeah.

12
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.040
So can we talk a little bit about yourself? Cause I'm like interesting.

13
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.060
<v 2>Yeah. So this is keto kid, AK little keto,</v>

14
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.520
AKA ASAP keto, keto Gambino.

15
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.030
<v 0>Are you trying to plug your child right away?</v>

16
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.320
<v 2>I just like try it. Alright. Go.</v>

17
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.280
<v 0>Okay. So the reason why I brought you here is because you have a very impressive</v>

18
00:01:16.281 --> 00:01:19.550
resume. Yeah. From what I understand, you worked at Citadel,

19
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.820
Instagram jumps trading. Yeah. These,

20
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.950
these are all like companies that got rejected from.

21
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:26.683
<v 2>Exempt.</v>

22
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.850
<v 0>But I'm very impressed. So can you tell me, like, why did you want to come here?</v>

23
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.760
<v 2>Yeah, I did. I did want to plug my channel, but um,</v>

24
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.630
I also did want to provide the content for like people. Um,

25
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.550
because I saw your brother's interview book quiet.

26
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.410
And so like provide for their content about the quiet and also show a side of

27
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.210
people in the quiet or tech spaces that are, non-traditional like me.

28
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.730
Like I want to show, I want to present that there are these people who.

29
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.180
<v 0>So what do you mean? Like, I can't, I can't tell. What's so special about you.</v>

30
00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:58.830
<v 2>Yeah. Uh.</v>

31
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.100
<v 0>Let's talk about where'd you go to college and what did you study?</v>

32
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.330
<v 2>Yeah. Um, so I did my undergrad in Hartford and then,</v>

33
00:02:08.331 --> 00:02:12.110
so I stayed in my bachelor's in computer science and my master's in statistics.

34
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.060
Oh, you have a master's too. Yeah. Are you done school? And that was cool.

35
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.160
I'm not, not going back anytime soon.

36
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.980
<v 0>Yeah. Okay. So are you, are you working full-time at YouTube now? Yeah.</v>

37
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.480
Or you're working full time. I thought you were still an intern. No, no, no. Oh,

38
00:02:26.481 --> 00:02:28.910
I see. I see. Okay. So you work full time at YouTube.

39
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.360
Can you talk to me a little bit about all your previous internship till now?

40
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.020
<v 2>I made the transition from quiet trading to tech. So I started out in,</v>

41
00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:39.050
turning out, set it out and then John and Dan, um,

42
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.770
and they transitioned into tech. So, um, before I started for tonight, uh,

43
00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:44.660
YouTube, I interned at Instagram as well.

44
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.640
<v 0>So, so you did set it off first then jump? Yeah. Okay. So I'd sit it out.</v>

45
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.740
You were a quantity. Yes. So what did you do?

46
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.740
<v 2>That's the dough I was into, I was looking into treasury funds.</v>

47
00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:56.300
So like one of the,

48
00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.420
one of the popular techniques in Quan to look at correlator financial products.

49
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.090
So usually like a lot of like financial products don't move in sync.

50
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.260
The market is not perfect. And so usually when something, yeah,

51
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.120
someone's lagging. So some,

52
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.990
sometimes like one product moves and then like the other product follows quickly

53
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:14.824
after.

54
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.790
But then if you're able to use correlate or financial products to predict a one

55
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.550
that you're interested in, um, you would have some.

56
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.100
<v 0>So wait, what was like the commodities or securities that you were trading?</v>

57
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.400
The ones I was looking at was treasury bonds. Treasury bonds. Yeah. Interesting.

58
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.270
Yeah. Okay. So, and then it jumped trading. It was it again, treasuries?

59
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.840
<v 2>Um, so jump training, the internship is a little bit different. So, um,</v>

60
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.960
the beginning is like a little bit of training for all the interns to like get

61
00:03:39.961 --> 00:03:42.330
on the same page. What kind of like Jane street, where they have fun. Yeah,

62
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.320
yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. It's kind of like, it's not, it's not fine. It's more,

63
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.620
it's more classes, more classes. And then, um, there,

64
00:03:49.621 --> 00:03:51.990
I worked on a project where I was trading market events.

65
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.890
So like market events or like big time events where the market is super

66
00:03:55.891 --> 00:04:00.630
unstable. So like examples are like quarterly earnings or like,

67
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.790
uh acquirements if a company acquires another, uh.

68
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.980
<v 0>What about when like someone tweeted about Obama,</v>

69
00:04:04.981 --> 00:04:09.560
that was like he was dead or something? Was that like a profitable day?

70
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.110
<v 2>I guess people wouldn't expect that, but, but yeah.</v>

71
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.350
Twitter is something that people also about sentimental analysis.

72
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.310
<v 0>Stuff like that too,</v>

73
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.630
because I remember from what I understand for like quant firms,

74
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.530
whenever there's a lot of like craziness or chaos in the market,

75
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.970
that's when you can profit the most.

76
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.830
Cause there's a lot of like exactly rationality or yeah.

77
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.230
<v 2>Yeah. The team, the team I was on was just purely trade off of events.</v>

78
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.550
Like they, they made all their money.

79
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.140
<v 0>Yeah. So how should you prepare for those interviews?</v>

80
00:04:40.141 --> 00:04:41.040
Like what did they ask you?

81
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.610
<v 2>Yeah, so I think, I think quite interviews are a kind of moat,</v>

82
00:04:44.611 --> 00:04:48.990
the most challenging because they include coding questions, finance questions,

83
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.770
and statistics questions. And usually the coding questions. Like,

84
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.880
have you done LICO before? Like, like the.

85
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.830
<v 0>Other website, but just in general? Yeah.</v>

86
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.560
<v 2>So like usually like software interviews are like medium level problems,</v>

87
00:05:01.561 --> 00:05:05.040
but then like the quiet interviews are like medium or hard level part. So like,

88
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.070
so it's that they're not even asking just for like basic software skills they're

89
00:05:08.071 --> 00:05:10.350
asking like for like higher level software.

90
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:11.663
<v 0>Like at that point,</v>

91
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.580
like it doesn't really make you a better software engineer digitally,

92
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:15.630
like tests. Are you intelligent?

93
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.860
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. I think cause like, I think once you get in,</v>

94
00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:21.180
like the work that you do is like,

95
00:05:21.181 --> 00:05:25.980
not as near like as challenging as like the interview problems, but yeah,

96
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.920
I think so you just have to have like a fundamental understanding of like some

97
00:05:28.921 --> 00:05:30.580
basic finance concepts and then.

98
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.540
<v 0>Some stats. What kind of stats do you need to know?</v>

99
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.300
Just like what's a portfolio or like what's a stock.

100
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.960
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. We're like what, where's the risk or how do you measure risk?</v>

101
00:05:42.961 --> 00:05:45.270
Or like some of these, some of these basic thoughts,

102
00:05:45.271 --> 00:05:47.820
you don't have to be like as sophisticated as I can. Right.

103
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.880
<v 0>Like it doesn't need to be like, Oh, what's the black shows model.</v>

104
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.100
How do you derive that? Probably not.

105
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.030
<v 2>They will ask you to write it, but if you have, if you know what it is. Yeah,</v>

106
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.390
yeah, yeah. Yeah.

107
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.670
<v 0>And then what about, what about stats? Like what kind of questions do they ask?</v>

108
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.660
<v 2>Um, it's usually like your game problems.</v>

109
00:06:04.661 --> 00:06:07.810
Like if I flip a coin so many times where like, how would I,

110
00:06:07.811 --> 00:06:11.290
if I have to pay for it or something like that, or like,

111
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.200
you're stuck in this room with this other guy.

112
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.450
There's always like some very like,

113
00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.170
like obscure pawn where like you're stuck on an Island. And then they say like,

114
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.140
when you have these different colored hats and like, it's like, Oh,

115
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.300
how would I arrange the hat, such diet, escape out of prison.

116
00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:27.880
It's like always like one of these like, like, like brain teaser,

117
00:06:27.881 --> 00:06:29.290
like just like strep strategy problems.

118
00:06:29.291 --> 00:06:31.270
Like if you're like playing games against someone.

119
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.760
<v 0>So any extra curriculars you did when you were in school that made you</v>

120
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.290
lean into finance?

121
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.780
<v 2>Um, I actually didn't really mess with the finance groups on, in school.</v>

122
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:47.170
I wanted to like make all my extracurriculars, like non-academic related.

123
00:06:47.171 --> 00:06:50.470
Cause like there were like, obviously like a lot of professional, like clubs,

124
00:06:50.471 --> 00:06:53.290
like finance clubs, tech clubs, but I didn't want to get them.

125
00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.560
Cause then cause then like you spend all your time,

126
00:06:56.561 --> 00:06:59.470
like building your career and then you don't have time for like having fun.

127
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:00.813
And so I didn't really join the.

128
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.500
<v 0>Oh yeah. I hate it. I hated that too.</v>

129
00:07:02.501 --> 00:07:07.150
Because when your identity is based on your career or at least like that very

130
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.710
narrow minded career path,

131
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.690
it's kind of boring and honestly it doesn't make as good like

132
00:07:13.691 --> 00:07:18.210
quants or data scientists or a software engineer, as you would think. Yeah.

133
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.900
So it's, I'm guessing you did music.

134
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:25.270
<v 2>I, I use, I started music, uh, later in my senior year, but then, um,</v>

135
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.360
throughout college I like kind of like, I was like in a dance troupe,

136
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.850
like hip hop, hip hop slash.

137
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.840
<v 0>[Inaudible] it's okay. Yeah. Cool. So why did you switch? Why did I switch?</v>

138
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.460
It seems like you were in quantum and now you're what software engineer. Yeah.

139
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:51.430
Yeah. What did I switch? Um, lost a lot of money there.

140
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:56.020
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. I did lose a lot of money. So I think there's two, two main reasons.</v>

141
00:07:56.021 --> 00:08:01.000
So one big reason is like I have a lot time now to like work on

142
00:08:01.001 --> 00:08:03.550
music stuff, because like, I think like, especially when I was quiet,

143
00:08:03.551 --> 00:08:07.060
like it is busy. It is very busy. It's very stressful.

144
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:10.720
I did want to find something that like gives me more opportunity to like learn

145
00:08:10.721 --> 00:08:14.020
more about myself. I didn't want to just like, just like work all the time.

146
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.780
Right. And then the second big reason was, um,

147
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.740
I did think that the way finance people like thought about things was like very

148
00:08:20.741 --> 00:08:23.440
limited. Everything is like just for the sake of money. And like, it felt,

149
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.670
it made me feel like I was losing like some human aspect,

150
00:08:27.671 --> 00:08:31.540
but a lot of the people that you do meet are like kind of like emotional.

151
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.550
<v 0>They kind of like act pure logically and rationally. Yes.</v>

152
00:08:36.551 --> 00:08:40.600
Very objective. Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah. Okay. But, um,

153
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.000
I hope you don't mind me asking,

154
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:47.650
how much did you get paid as a Citadel intern and jump trading and Instagram?

155
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:53.230
I can look them up if you want. I can look them up if you want. Um,

156
00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:57.480

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.110
And it's about all the OG quants back in the day,

167
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:36.230

If you go on audible.com/joma or text Joma at 500, 500,

173
00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.290
if you are in the U S.

174
00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.790
<v 2>So it was about, it was about, um, 10 weeks.</v>

175
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.140
So 2300 a week. And then, uh, Facebook,

176
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:10.280
I want to say it was like eight K a month. Yeah, that sounds about right.

177
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.290
That sounds about right. Okay.

178
00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.770
<v 0>So yeah. So since you didn't do extracurricular in Quan,</v>

179
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:19.100
how did you know about quant or want to be in school?

180
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:20.990
<v 2>I was kind of like,</v>

181
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.880
always like in the math competition community throughout like middle school and

182
00:10:25.881 --> 00:10:30.710
high school. Yeah. So like in the math competition space,

183
00:10:30.711 --> 00:10:35.150
like usually like you would have, like, you want to send by is yeah. Yeah.

184
00:10:35.151 --> 00:10:38.150
So we, so we have like, uh,

185
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:41.150
like kids who are like two or three years older than us. And like,

186
00:10:41.151 --> 00:10:42.230
we always look up to them.

187
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:47.420
And then in college we see like a lot of our senpai's like either going to like

188
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.790
academic math or like software client,

189
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:53.090
and usually like Quanta is something that's really popular with like the

190
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.210
competitive math people. So I got into, I got introduced to that.

191
00:10:56.211 --> 00:10:59.240
And then like the interview problems are also like very representative of like

192
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:03.080
the old problems that we used to do on weird, like in high school. Uh,

193
00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.590
so it was very natural and it's also like very competitive, like in nature.

194
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:12.590
<v 0>So I guess you were always like good at math and you compete in math and stuff</v>

195
00:11:12.591 --> 00:11:15.350
like that. Yeah. Did you score well in those countries?

196
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:17.960
<v 2>Uh, are you familiar with the U S competition?</v>

197
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:21.920
<v 0>Maybe they are. Maybe they are so you can say stuff and I'll just nod.</v>

198
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:26.630
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. Uh, I, the furthest I got was to like the USA ammo,</v>

199
00:11:26.631 --> 00:11:28.370
which is like the USA, not lumpia.

200
00:11:28.371 --> 00:11:32.480
It's about like 500 us students who qualify. Um,

201
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:35.450
it's part of like the it's part of like, it's part of like the track too,

202
00:11:35.451 --> 00:11:39.680
like the USA I'm Latina, but I never got that far. That was too hard.

203
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.010
<v 0>Yeah. But from what I understand, if you do want to be in quant,</v>

204
00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.710
you gotta be good at math, I guess.

205
00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.950
Or do you have any other tips for people who want to be in quantum.

206
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:54.220
<v 2>Um, for high school students or like college students from high school then.</v>

207
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.770
<v 0>And then we can talk about college, you know,</v>

208
00:11:56.771 --> 00:11:59.760
if they start it like to be a quantity college. Yeah.

209
00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:04.020
<v 2>I really, I really don't like the idea of like telling people what to do.</v>

210
00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:08.070
Cause like a lot of people they say like, I aspire to be X and they say like,

211
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:11.040
I have steps one, two, three, four, you. And then like,

212
00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.590
and then if they follow those steps, they say, I read that book.

213
00:12:13.591 --> 00:12:16.920
I read that book by student. I still didn't get it. And it's all because of you,

214
00:12:16.921 --> 00:12:21.750
because he told me to read that book. So, but yeah, no. Yeah. You feel me?

215
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:26.500
Yeah. So, um, but I do think like in general, like it,

216
00:12:26.501 --> 00:12:28.530
it still is good to like, uh,

217
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:33.510
get exposure to competitive math or just like get exposure to like,

218
00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:38.340
um, just like stepping outside of like your like normal school stuff.

219
00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:41.700
Cause like, I think like in school, like you don't get challenged enough. Um,

220
00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.100
even if you're like your school doesn't offer like competitive math.

221
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:47.850
<v 0>So that was like a very general approach. And honestly, I believe you like,</v>

222
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:51.000
there's not one single path to like Quan,

223
00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:55.380
but can you just tell me like one kind of path, like what she learned,

224
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.520
what should you major in? And then like what extracurriculars you should,

225
00:12:59.521 --> 00:13:02.460
if you don't, you chose some, I'm sorry. I know,

226
00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:06.390
like I hate responding to these messages too.

227
00:13:06.391 --> 00:13:08.790
About how do you get suffer in general? How do you get into data science?

228
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.470
Especially data science. Because for me,

229
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:13.500
I mean analytics and you can do whatever you want to get analytics.

230
00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.870
So it could be a business dude. You could be a consultant,

231
00:13:15.871 --> 00:13:19.170
you could be a math major, computer science. You could do anything. Yeah.

232
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:23.310
But yeah, just give them like one little, one little spiel,

233
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:27.390
like one little path that at least you did or like that you saw other people do.

234
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.450
Okay. Common path, most common paths, easy.

235
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:36.300
<v 2>Yeah. Like pretty much like high probability of scoring yourself. Okay. Okay.</v>

236
00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.490
Do you have competitive math in high school.

237
00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:43.200
<v 0>And you're smart. You know, don't be an idiot. You have you're smarter.</v>

238
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.090
<v 2>I guess. Yeah. Uh, college,</v>

239
00:13:48.091 --> 00:13:52.560
I guess the popular majors will be either pure math, applied math,

240
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:55.110
computer science, stats, physics.

241
00:13:55.111 --> 00:13:58.800
In some cases I think a lot of Palm places love physics people for some reason.

242
00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.020
And then extracurriculars. I mean,

243
00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.210
you could go out of your way to do the finance stuff,

244
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.750
but then I would suggest against it because I think those are more for like

245
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:08.040
iBanking people. Yeah.

246
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:11.010
<v 0>Uh, like where it's all about networking and like seeing if you're.</v>

247
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.100
<v 1>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that's pretty good.</v>

248
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.890
<v 2>Or they teach you how to network with people.</v>

249
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:18.870
They have classes just purely goes for that.

250
00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:20.840
Cause like that's like a critical part to your like yeah.

251
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:24.990
<v 0>Yeah. Well, I guess that it's it's um, enough about Quan.</v>

252
00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:29.160
I want to talk more about like your personal life, more about like your, uh,

253
00:14:29.161 --> 00:14:32.700
your career in rapping or sorry. As an artist.

254
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:37.320
<v 2>I think for every rapper, I'm not a rapper. I'm the artist. Yeah.</v>

255
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:40.710
<v 0>But every rapper is okay. I'm going to stop you here. Wait,</v>

256
00:14:40.711 --> 00:14:43.800
what's the problem of calling you a rapper. What's the what problem?

257
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.560
Cause I don't want to get this.

258
00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:49.890
<v 1>Oh, okay. Oh you ain't rapper. Yeah. I don't, I don't want,</v>

259
00:14:49.891 --> 00:14:52.220
I don't want to drama. I, I just want to be an artist.

260
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:53.750
<v 2>In your career in rapping.</v>

261
00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:58.420
<v 0>Or sorry, as an artist. Okay. So yeah. When did you start that?</v>

262
00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:04.750
<v 2>Um, I stir that around my senior year of college. Um,</v>

263
00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.880
that's pretty late. I thought it would be earlier.

264
00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:11.100
I think I was always kind of into it. Um, and then I think,

265
00:15:11.101 --> 00:15:14.410
I think like in college, like there, there was like a dark moment in my life.

266
00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.370
Um, and then I think I listened to Tupac a lot.

267
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.910
Like music does have the power to like change your mood or like brighten your

268
00:15:21.911 --> 00:15:24.820
day. And so I, I just kinda want to contribute to that.

269
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:28.780
<v 0>Yeah. So I see your shirt. You want to show the shirt to the camera real quick.</v>

270
00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.300
Cause it's freezer and yeah. So are you, we have.

271
00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.100
<v 2>I think we are blue is more for non-Asians.</v>

272
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:40.510
<v 0>Oh really? I love anime. Yeah.</v>

273
00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.820
So which, which ones? Which ones do you like?

274
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:48.100
<v 2>Which ones do I like? I grew up with [inaudible] I think. Yeah.</v>

275
00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:52.660
<v 0>Every DUI do you watch? My startup series? Uh,</v>

276
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.633
rely on calendar.

277
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.260
<v 2>I watched like one or something.</v>

278
00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:02.250
[inaudible].

279
00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:06.670
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. So let's talk about music now. Um, so what,</v>

280
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:09.340
so the music that you make, it's more like hype music, right?

281
00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:14.380
You have some bars you can show me. Yeah. I think like it's,

282
00:16:14.381 --> 00:16:17.080
it's going to be hard. Cause like I don't have a beat. I don't have anything,

283
00:16:17.081 --> 00:16:21.070
but it's just raw voice. Do you think? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah.

284
00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:23.140
<v 2>Let's start. Let's try something. All right.</v>

285
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:28.360
I'm bumping with Joma in the studio had told him that we can

286
00:16:28.361 --> 00:16:32.470
record a video. John was at Facebook. I'm at YouTube.

287
00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:37.270
John was at Facebook, but he still do YouTube. Pipe it up.

288
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.960
Give it up for the interview. Hit the, like you already gave a view,

289
00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:42.940
hit the sub. If you'd like the bars in,

290
00:16:42.941 --> 00:16:47.710
if you are new making six figures cashing out only 22 that came

291
00:16:47.711 --> 00:16:51.550
about after this going to get a tattoo probably of Gemma's face.

292
00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:52.600
Think it's gonna make me.

293
00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:53.493
<v 0>Cool.</v>

294
00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:03.400
We only took like five takes. You know, that was, that was pretty good.

295
00:17:03.401 --> 00:17:06.630
Not always one shot. And I was one shot. Okay. Let, let,

296
00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:09.820
let me show you [inaudible] all right. All right. Okay.

297
00:17:09.821 --> 00:17:13.510
So it was going to be embarrassing, but let me, let me, okay, doc,

298
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.990
let's be real. Are you plebs? Want to be like me? Want to be in demand?

299
00:17:16.991 --> 00:17:17.920
Land jobs like me?

300
00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:21.250
Want to run up at the term and code like me by ain't none of you mope was brain

301
00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.010
good. Like me popping pills. Micro dosing. Just to be on my level.

302
00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.490
But you broke as monkeys. Kevin Beck for the devil steal your jobs to your girl.

303
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.480
I'll make you a cuckold.

304
00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:32.290
I cut up all that's the last line is not me then no one is sneaking in nausea

305
00:17:32.291 --> 00:17:34.750
and I didn't finish it, but yeah, something like that. Okay.

306
00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.530
Then you got some bars. Oh thanks bro. Yeah, of course.

307
00:17:37.531 --> 00:17:40.750
And in verse two was like code. Tell the team I need more monies.
