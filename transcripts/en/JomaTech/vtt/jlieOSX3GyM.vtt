1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.310
<v 0>We're back and here with Gary tan.</v>

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.490
So we're going to be talking more about VC stuff. Cause, um,

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.620
I have a lot of friends who say that ultimately they want to end up being a

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.470
VC investor. Totally. Is that how we say VC investor.

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.660
<v 1>A venture capitalists? Sure. A VC.</v>

6
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.400
<v 0>Their reasoning is that they don't really want to do the work of building</v>

7
00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:24.510
things, but they want to, um, advise people and, you know,

8
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.300
think about what would be a good product. And then.

9
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.920
<v 1>Oh my God, I guess I would tell them don't do it. Okay. Yeah,</v>

10
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.340
because then you'll end up being remember earlier in the,

11
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.400
in the episode we were talking about their investors who lead and they make up

12
00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:40.580
their own minds. And then there are people who just check, check, check,

13
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.220
check the box, and then only want to, you know,

14
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.810
invest when it's absolutely a sure thing. Right. But I guess even okay.

15
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.000
<v 0>Say they do want to, like, they do want to lead. Yeah. They still want to lead.</v>

16
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:57.560
Right. I don't know if I'm, um, relined or messages correctly,

17
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.250
but for me it sounds like, uh, they don't really want to do the work. Right.

18
00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:03.170
They want to do the purely intellectual thing,

19
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.710
which is obviously there's so much work though. That's what I was thinking.

20
00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:09.330
So can you tell me about like your day to day or?

21
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.470
<v 1>Yeah, totally. Um, I mean, VC had done right.</v>

22
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.500
Is literally like your schedule is like, you know,

23
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.270
9:00 AM to 6:00 PM or honestly I have kids now. So, you know,

24
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.800
if I didn't,

25
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.910
I probably do be doing like literally like 7:00 AM till like

26
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.780
2:00 AM, you know, just things all day. Right. Uh,

27
00:01:29.781 --> 00:01:31.610
but now that I do have two young children,

28
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.510
I have to actually cut it back to like, well, get to office at nine.

29
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.320
I have to leave by five cause I gotta pick up my four-year-old. Right. Um,

30
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.230
and of course I can get a few hours in the evening,

31
00:01:42.231 --> 00:01:43.880
but I better sleep because you know,

32
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.650
my five month old is going to cry all night.

33
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.150
And so honestly this job done right. Will actually feel, uh,

34
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.810
any amount of space that you give it. And so it is a lot of work to do it,

35
00:01:53.811 --> 00:01:57.470
right. Because, uh, every other day, um,

36
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.910
someone lost their best customer. They lost their director of engineering. Uh,

37
00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:04.520
you know, someone somewhere in my portfolio,

38
00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:07.760
people are getting punched in the face and you know,

39
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.810
on that day when maybe the company is going to die, I have to pick up the phone.

40
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.640
I can't just be like decline. Right.

41
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.960
<v 0>So what do you have to do? Like if a company dies, it's not like you have it,</v>

42
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.230
somebody you have a say on what they have to do.

43
00:02:21.231 --> 00:02:22.790
So what do you do to prevent that?

44
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.970
<v 1>Yeah, a lot of it is how do we find a better person? Like if we're,</v>

45
00:02:25.971 --> 00:02:27.860
if it's personnel, like how do we recruit?

46
00:02:27.861 --> 00:02:30.770
How do we hire get me on the phone with this person,

47
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.950
if it's a losing a customer, like let's find other customers,

48
00:02:33.951 --> 00:02:37.820
let's make a spreadsheet of a hundred other people who could fill in that hole.

49
00:02:37.821 --> 00:02:39.200
And let's, um, you know,

50
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.280
we'll actually come through all nine partners at initialized,

51
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.930
their whole networks. And then we'll,

52
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.610
we actually built software for this to basically get customers and uh,

53
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.000
hire people for our companies. And so all of these things are a lot of work.

54
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:55.070
Like we kind of run it like a startup itself.

55
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.910
<v 0>Yeah. I actually had no idea that VCs were such help. Well, we do it this way.</v>

56
00:02:58.911 --> 00:03:00.010
There a few other people.

57
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.770
<v 1>Who do it like that Andreessen Horowitz is known to have, you know,</v>

58
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.940
probably more than a hundred people who work as an operating company on behalf

59
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:10.000
of their founders. Oh, that's really cool. Yeah. We have nine.

60
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.110
So we're just getting.

61
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.100
<v 0>Started. Okay. So you called these operators, right?</v>

62
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.780
<v 1>Yeah. Operating partners, but you know,</v>

63
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.740
every single one of our operating partners also can do their own deals and bring

64
00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:22.800
in companies. Um, they're not expected to, but you know,

65
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.040
we want them to learn how to do the business.

66
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.820
<v 0>Okay. So what kind of people would be, would become good VCs? Yeah.</v>

67
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.020
<v 1>Honestly, great founders are sort of the best because, um,</v>

68
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.340
those are the people who can actually help. Like when something happens,

69
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.890
it's just not, you know, totally new, you know,

70
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.280
I don't have to call in a favor from my network. It's like, Oh, when I,

71
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.520
when I had that problem, here's what I did. Um,

72
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.450
and that's just more useful when you're trying to avoid the landmines. Um,

73
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.660
and so the best version of that is actually start a company.

74
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.590
And even if it doesn't work out, like you'll have learned so much, uh,

75
00:03:58.591 --> 00:04:02.820
the next best thing honestly, is join a fast growing company, uh, as it's,

76
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.890
you know, sort of in hypergrowth. Um,

77
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.530
here's a really useful a rule of thumb for your viewers. Um, you can basically,

78
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.200
if you wanted to evaluate any startup the way a VC does,

79
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.670
just figure out what the growth rate is. Um, and this might be revenue,

80
00:04:17.671 --> 00:04:22.020
it might be users. Um, it depends on what the company is, but,

81
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.770
uh, basically for seed to series a,

82
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.450
if they're growing three acts a year, um, that's pretty good.

83
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.920
Like that's sort of like a solid B um, anything, four X and above.

84
00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:39.630
That's like an, a, like a five is like a plus it's like five X a year, really,

85
00:04:39.631 --> 00:04:43.020
really hard to sustain. And then anything growing around two X,

86
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.330
like C plus C, like, you know,

87
00:04:45.331 --> 00:04:48.420
and this is sort of a measure of why startups are so hard,

88
00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:50.100
like literally startups are growth.

89
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.620
And if you've ever tried to grow something like by two or even two X a year,

90
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.400
that's really hard. Um, but that's sort of how people can evaluate as a,

91
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.300
you know, a non VC, the, you just figure out how fast that thing is growing.

92
00:05:03.301 --> 00:05:06.570
And that'll actually tell you whether your startup is living or dying.

93
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.910
They're like sharks. Basically. They have to keep growing.

94
00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:11.850
Otherwise they'll die. They have to keep moving. Otherwise they'll die. Yeah.

95
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.930
<v 0>Yeah. So for engineers and PMs currently, yeah. Um,</v>

96
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.660
if they want to go into VC,

97
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.590
then the best thing they should do is join a startup or even start your own

98
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.100
startups so that they can build empathy for the startups that they will invest

99
00:05:26.101 --> 00:05:26.934
in. Right. Absolutely.

100
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.310
<v 1>And then it's about that story. Like, you know,</v>

101
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.290
what did you do for that company? And, you know,

102
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.580
a lot of people jump over to VC because they're the person who they were the

103
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.750
growth PM for something that grew from like a million users to a hundred million

104
00:05:39.751 --> 00:05:44.250
users. And that's the kind of experience that is like almost impossible to get.

105
00:05:44.251 --> 00:05:48.390
And those are the people who are deeply sought after in the world for their

106
00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:52.560
advice. And so, you know, that's why joining a fast growing startup,

107
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.540
sometimes it's even better than starting your own,

108
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.400
cause it's really hard to start your own. So if they have all the skills.

109
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.290
<v 0>They, how does it work in terms of the money?</v>

110
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:02.780
Because I don't really understand how the VC world works.

111
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.580
So do you usually try to join a VC firm and then pay your stake so that you

112
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:11.510
could be a managing partner or operating partner? How does it work?

113
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.800
How do you even join one?

114
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.510
<v 1>Yeah, absolutely. Um, I think there are kind of a few different paths.</v>

115
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.110
The first one would be, um, you know, work as an operator,

116
00:06:20.111 --> 00:06:22.600
maybe early in your career, find some sort of when,

117
00:06:22.601 --> 00:06:26.530
like I was the person who scaled, like, you know, this 10 X at, you know,

118
00:06:26.531 --> 00:06:30.040
this fast growing company. Um, and then early in people's career,

119
00:06:30.041 --> 00:06:34.900
they could join as an associate at a venture capital firm. And, um, you usually,

120
00:06:34.901 --> 00:06:37.690
you have to find your way to network in, to meet the person.

121
00:06:37.691 --> 00:06:39.640
A lot of is just purely trust, right?

122
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:44.500
If people think you're smart and scrappy and hungry, um,

123
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.310
and you know, they've met you like sometimes they're just going to hire you.

124
00:06:48.311 --> 00:06:52.570
Like the next time they have an associate. The next level is sort of principals.

125
00:06:52.571 --> 00:06:56.050
I mean, these are people who sort of start as VCs, um,

126
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:57.640
and then get promoted once.

127
00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.210
And those are people who start taking more investing responsibility,

128
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.750
associates tend to do mainly sourcing. So, you know,

129
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.120
sometimes going to events or, you know,

130
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.420
going into Excel spreadsheets or writing software to basically go,

131
00:07:10.421 --> 00:07:13.180
come through the internet and figure out what's happening,

132
00:07:13.181 --> 00:07:17.020
what are companies that could be good opportunities. And then they'll work with,

133
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.730
um, you know, the general partner, uh, or, you know, the,

134
00:07:20.731 --> 00:07:24.970
basically the investing partner to bring that to the whole team. And so,

135
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.670
you know, the associate role is not that glamorous,

136
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.550
but it's kind of like starting out in any business.

137
00:07:30.551 --> 00:07:35.110
It starts out as you kind of have to do like the SCUP work. And then as you go,

138
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.780
uh, associate principal, um,

139
00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.020
sometimes there's a managing director role and then, you know,

140
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.700
making partner is kind of what it sounds like it's a really big deal because

141
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:50.440
only then do you really get a significant part of sort of the winnings from a

142
00:07:50.441 --> 00:07:53.500
given fund, we call that carry in the business. Um,

143
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:57.070
so only after you returned the whole fund, um,

144
00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.730
the partners tend to get 20 to 30% of, uh,

145
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.820
anything after you returned the money to your limited partners,

146
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.540
limited partners are the people who give you money to invest.

147
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:12.160
<v 0>Got it. Okay. So for example, for initialized capital, you and Alexis,</v>

148
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.800
you guys are the founding partners, right?

149
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.770
And then you guys probably put in your own money at first that's right.

150
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.980
And then you guys have bunch of, I guess,

151
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.310
associates that maybe become principal and then maybe a partner.

152
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.620
We just have partners. You guys just have partners. Okay, cool.

153
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.410
So they have partners. So they put a stake in,

154
00:08:29.411 --> 00:08:33.070
do they have to like pay an amount to be in it or like invest your own money?

155
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:33.761
<v 1>Oh, I mean,</v>

156
00:08:33.761 --> 00:08:37.540
we're basically investing on behalf of some of the biggest endowments and

157
00:08:37.541 --> 00:08:40.930
institutions in the world. So the universities, you know,

158
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:45.130
when you watch PBS and you hear about, you know, X foundation and Y foundation,

159
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:45.940
uh,

160
00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.360
they're large pools of capital that are billions of dollars that are basically

161
00:08:49.361 --> 00:08:53.770
run, uh, often to support some sort of non-profit or some sort of, um, you know,

162
00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.100
university, some sort of big goal. Uh,

163
00:08:56.110 --> 00:09:00.420
those are pools of capital that have to grow in order to actually support their

164
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:02.010
mission. So, uh, you know,

165
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:05.880
Harvard or Stanford or any university that has an endowment, um,

166
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.510
they actually can't spend the money that they have when you hear about Harvard

167
00:09:09.511 --> 00:09:11.160
having $38 billion,

168
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.730
they can't just take a dollar out of that endowment and just, uh, you know,

169
00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:15.900
give someone a scholarship.

170
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:20.070
They actually have to go and give that to other investors and those, you know,

171
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.760
private equity or hedge funds or, you know, fidelity,

172
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:27.450
there's so many ways to invest. And then venture capital, uh,

173
00:09:27.451 --> 00:09:32.280
is crazy because it's only, you know, something like 1% or, you know,

174
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.360
all of venture capital is, uh, only a hundred billion dollars a year.

175
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.810
Whereas the total amount of money going in through the financial system is

176
00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:42.240
easily in the trillions. And so, uh,

177
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.280
everything that we talk about with venture capital,

178
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:48.750
it's basically this tiny mote of dust on this vast ocean of finance.

179
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.730
And there's more capital in the world than people know what to do if at this

180
00:09:53.731 --> 00:09:56.640
point, which is like mind boggling for me.

181
00:09:56.641 --> 00:10:01.050
Like if you told the 15 year old me that there's more money in the world than

182
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.340
anyone knows what to do with,

183
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:06.780
I wouldn't believe you because we didn't have money and how, you know.

184
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.630
And so that's one of the core problems in society today. It's like,

185
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.710
how do these giant pools of capital actually put it towards, you know,

186
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.610
businesses that employ people that actually have useful for society?

187
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.880
So that's why venture capital is probably one of the most important businesses.

188
00:10:20.881 --> 00:10:22.800
And I'm, you know, I'm glad people want to do it,

189
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:27.150
but the best venture capitalists are probably people who also started their own

190
00:10:27.151 --> 00:10:28.820
too, so they can actually help them.

191
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:29.720
<v 0>It's a lot of sense.</v>

192
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.110
Can you tell me a little bit of the timeline for initialized capital?

193
00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:35.630
Like how much money you've raised and now they,

194
00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:37.820
how much you've grown and stuff like that, just to get.

195
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:39.470
<v 1>Yeah, totally. Uh,</v>

196
00:10:39.471 --> 00:10:43.070
we started off with a small $7 million fund about seven years ago,

197
00:10:43.071 --> 00:10:47.720
and now we have over $500 million under management.

198
00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.110
Um, our newest fund is $225 million.

199
00:10:51.111 --> 00:10:55.970
So we will write checks of a million dollars to $5 million, uh,

200
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:59.390
in exchange for about 15% of companies. Um,

201
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.810
and so we'll lead and we'll do the whole round. And, you know, if we,

202
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:05.470
if we write a really big check, we'll sit on the board, um,

203
00:11:05.471 --> 00:11:06.650
and that was very different.

204
00:11:06.651 --> 00:11:11.180
Like we are a true institutional venture capital firm before now,

205
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.970
but before we actually started kind of like angels,

206
00:11:13.971 --> 00:11:18.770
like we were writing a $50,000 checks, $25,000 checks. And even then I was like,

207
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.990
that's a crazy amount of money. Um, but we were writing them into companies, uh,

208
00:11:22.991 --> 00:11:26.750
as the first check and those companies became billion dollar companies.

209
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:30.380
And so that kept happening and we realized, well,

210
00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:35.120
instead of sending 20 or 30 emails to all everyone else saying, Hey,

211
00:11:35.121 --> 00:11:38.270
this is a good company. You should invest in it. We just write one check,

212
00:11:38.271 --> 00:11:40.730
the founder is done and then we get back to work. Right.

213
00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.870
And that was sort of the evolution of us from going tiny checks and helping

214
00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:48.980
other people to helping other investors to, well, we'll just do the whole thing.

215
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:54.670
<v 0>So what were some of your biggest wins personally that you have</v>

216
00:11:54.671 --> 00:11:56.830
rewarded yourself financially the most?

217
00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.750
<v 1>I mean, honestly, I participant super lucky. Like for me,</v>

218
00:12:00.751 --> 00:12:04.650
Stanford was pretty crazy because the people you got to meet, I mean,

219
00:12:04.651 --> 00:12:05.460
you went to Waterloo,

220
00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.210
like the people you get to sit next to people who are going to go on and do all

221
00:12:09.211 --> 00:12:12.590
kinds of insane stuff. And when I was there, I had no idea. Okay. So.

222
00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:13.680
<v 0>I guess what I meant was like,</v>

223
00:12:13.681 --> 00:12:17.070
what was your best exit and how much did you make up? Yeah.

224
00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.110
<v 1>Yeah. So I've actually never talked about this,</v>

225
00:12:19.111 --> 00:12:23.790
but we did sell postures for $20 million. Co-founders uh,

226
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:24.653
two co-founders.

227
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.540
<v 0>Okay. Okay. And did you have initial investors?</v>

228
00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:31.470
<v 1>Yes, we did. Um, and we'll tell you how much I actually made. Um,</v>

229
00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:34.470
but I can tell you how, uh, as a VC,

230
00:12:34.471 --> 00:12:37.920
I try and figure out how much people made from a given exit. Um,

231
00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:40.800
so obviously you have the acquisition price, and then again,

232
00:12:40.801 --> 00:12:42.810
going back to cap table, um,

233
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.980
you can kind of guess most co-founders are probably close to equal,

234
00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:50.970
but not always, but assuming that it makes the math easier if everyone's equal.

235
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:56.460
Um, and then basically count the number of funding rounds they've done. Um,

236
00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:00.420
if it's an early round, like a seed round or a series, a, uh,

237
00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:05.010
sometimes a series B it's about 20% of dilution, meaning, uh,

238
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.210
investors came in and bought 20% of the company at that moment.

239
00:13:09.211 --> 00:13:13.110
And then the founders and the employees would only own 80% after that funding

240
00:13:13.111 --> 00:13:13.380
round.

241
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:17.790
<v 0>So if you had 50% and then after one funding round, you would have 40.</v>

242
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:22.710
<v 1>Yeah, exactly. Um, and then you can count them up, basically the series CS,</v>

243
00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:27.090
C D E like G you know, they go on for awhile these days. Um,

244
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:31.290
those tend to go from, you know, 10% for the B uh,

245
00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.400
down to sometimes just one or 2% for the much later rounds.

246
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:39.660
So almost all of the dilution is actually usually in the seed series a and B.

247
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.910
<v 0>I see. Okay. Just mostly in B. So if you.</v>

248
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:42.960
<v 1>Ever wanted to do the math,</v>

249
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:46.860
just count the percentages and then do the math and multiply it by the, uh,

250
00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:49.620
acquisition price. And that's how much that person probably made.

251
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:54.840
<v 0>And I'm sorry for asking this question, but what about being a VC?</v>

252
00:13:54.841 --> 00:13:57.510
How much can you make from that, given the success?

253
00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.650
I'll tell you how to do the math for that too. All right.

254
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:01.980
<v 1>Um, let's make the math easy. Say,</v>

255
00:14:01.981 --> 00:14:05.010
say VC has a hundred million dollar venture capital fund.

256
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.180
So they raised a hundred million dollars from other people. Um,

257
00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:13.530
and then a lot of people often ask, like, how much does the VC usually put in?

258
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:18.330
So, um, it varies. It's sometimes as low as 1%. Um,

259
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.790
w you know, sometimes it's as high as I think, um,

260
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:25.320
Peter teal is putting in 20% of the billion and a half dollar fund that he's

261
00:14:25.321 --> 00:14:28.650
raising for founder's fund or has raised. So it varies.

262
00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.490
So for a hundred million dollar fund,

263
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.560
that the people who run that fund might only put a million dollars in total.

264
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:39.900
And then what happens is they invest that over usually two to three

265
00:14:39.901 --> 00:14:44.790
years. Uh, and then 10 sort of 10 to 15 years from, from,

266
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:49.830
uh, that they're kind of expected to give back something like between,

267
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:55.340
uh, surprisingly a low number of like maybe two X or three X, two X,

268
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.340
two X to three X is basically, um,

269
00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:01.430
considered a pretty decent fund. Uh,

270
00:15:01.431 --> 00:15:05.750
so meaning investors gave them a hundred million and they have to give back 200

271
00:15:05.751 --> 00:15:10.130
to $300 million in the next 10 to 15 years. I see. Um,

272
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:14.510
and then the typical carry for a VC fund is 20 to 30%.

273
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:18.610
And so, uh, all of the VC partnership, if they own it,

274
00:15:18.611 --> 00:15:23.000
if it's only a two X fund would make about $20 million. Nice. Thanks for that.

275
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:27.040
So it's really simple numbers, but it is an incredible job, right?

276
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:31.630
That's what it's finance is crazy. Um,

277
00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:36.550
so friends of mine actually started a company with Peter teal in 2004.

278
00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:42.370
And, um, I was 22 years old, just graduated.

279
00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:42.910
Um,

280
00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:47.140
didn't know anything about money or how companies started to know anything about

281
00:15:47.141 --> 00:15:48.010
venture capital.

282
00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:52.870
I got my first full-time job with Microsoft up in Seattle program manager,

283
00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:57.190
program manager for windows mobile, weirdly enough, um, you know, two,

284
00:15:57.191 --> 00:15:59.860
three years before the iPhone, uh, ever came out.

285
00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:04.410
And so I saw them just kind of try and copy designs,

286
00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:08.680
like literally copying, like the checkbox mentality of, um, you know,

287
00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:12.220
here's what rim does. Let's just copy it. But it was my first job.

288
00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:14.560
I had health insurance, uh, you know,

289
00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:16.450
I actually could have a really nice apartment.

290
00:16:16.451 --> 00:16:21.010
I ran out and bought a new car and, um, and then my friends called and said,

291
00:16:21.011 --> 00:16:24.460
Hey, you got to quit your job. Uh, we're starting a company with Peter teal.

292
00:16:24.461 --> 00:16:27.370
You know, the guy, I mean, and Peter teal was not a billionaire yet.

293
00:16:27.371 --> 00:16:30.070
I think he had just sold PayPal. Um,

294
00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:32.860
he was probably worth like tens of millions of dollars at that point,

295
00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:37.000
which was still like insane. And he said, well, come have dinner with me.

296
00:16:37.001 --> 00:16:40.600
I flew down to San Francisco. He had just opened a French restaurant. Uh,

297
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:44.190
the French restaurant was bad. It was terrible. The French restaurant. Yeah.

298
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.560
I mean, it's one of those things. When you sell a company, you know,

299
00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:51.340
you buy the flashy car, you open your own restaurant. Like, you know,

300
00:16:51.341 --> 00:16:54.490
you get it all out of your system. That's fun. It's called free zone.

301
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.010
It was terrible. The restaurant closed almost immediately,

302
00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.630
but it was about the time he wrote the $500,000 check to Facebook that made him

303
00:17:01.631 --> 00:17:03.940
a billion dollars, or it made him a true billionaire.

304
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.790
And I had met him a bunch of times. I hadn't come to speak at Stanford.

305
00:17:06.791 --> 00:17:09.400
So it wasn't like, I didn't know who this person was. It was like,

306
00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:11.110
clearly a Silicon Valley legend.

307
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:14.680
And here he was having dinner with me the 22 year old, you know,

308
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:18.370
pro program manager. He's like, Gary, what the hell are you doing at Microsoft?

309
00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:20.110
You're wasting your life. Um,

310
00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:24.130
I'm so sure you quitting your job and joining the startup is the right thing.

311
00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:27.340
He got out his personal checkbook and he said, um,

312
00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.820
I'm gonna write you a check for $70,000,

313
00:17:30.821 --> 00:17:35.470
which is my whole annual salary in 2004, uh, which is more money than I'd ever,

314
00:17:35.471 --> 00:17:40.060
you know, I was probably $40,000 in, uh, in debt, um, you know,

315
00:17:40.061 --> 00:17:43.540
student loans and credit cards and all that. It's like, um,

316
00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:48.160
and cause because I ran out and I didn't treat money like, um, you know,

317
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:50.580
capital and time I treated it as well.

318
00:17:50.581 --> 00:17:54.810
I deserve this because I have a job now and you know, the job's really hard,

319
00:17:54.811 --> 00:17:56.160
so I should have nice stuff.

320
00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:01.020
I'd like basically fell into that trap of being lulled into like the physical,

321
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.080
having nice things, you know? Um, and the problem was,

322
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:09.330
I felt like I couldn't take the risk. It was crazy. Right. Um, I had, you know,

323
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:14.070
and so he said, you're here, take this check. I'm sure this is right.

324
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.650
I got on a plane back to Seattle. And I said, no.

325
00:18:16.651 --> 00:18:21.030
And that company became Palentier, uh, which is, you know,

326
00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:25.800
worth 20 to $40 billion depending on who you talk to. And so easily,

327
00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:31.410
uh, the equity from that, if I had joined at that moment as a first engineer,

328
00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:35.820
it would have been worth probably close to $200 million. Um,

329
00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:37.620
and that's the kind of decisions.

330
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:40.980
Those are the kinds of decisions that people have to make. Uh,

331
00:18:40.981 --> 00:18:44.850
when you're a maker, it's completely crazy. Um, but it's commonplace.

332
00:18:44.851 --> 00:18:46.170
You spend any time in,

333
00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:50.250
around here and you just get run into people who literally say no to the next

334
00:18:50.251 --> 00:18:51.810
Facebook or no, sorry.

335
00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:56.760
Actually say no to actually Google or actually Facebook actually. Yeah.

336
00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.790
But that's also kind of the crazy thing about tech now.

337
00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:04.050
It's like we are touching every part of society, uh, with software.

338
00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.840
And so I don't know, I spent a lot of time trying to decide,

339
00:19:06.841 --> 00:19:11.580
like why did I make that crazy $200 million mistake?

340
00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.490
And, um, that it was just.

341
00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:18.320
<v 0>Well, I mean, you're doing pretty well right now, so I think it's not that bad.</v>

342
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:21.050
Yeah. But, um, it's a good, did end up going,

343
00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:24.380
you did end up working for Palentier. Yeah. I just joined a year later,

344
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:26.120
a year later. So I mean,

345
00:19:26.121 --> 00:19:29.360
I guess that's a big difference in terms of like equity percentages, but yeah,

346
00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:32.450
totally. But yeah. So I guess that was still pretty fruitful for you.

347
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:34.100
You designed a logo. That was cool.

348
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:36.530
<v 1>That was fun. And I got to see what it was like, you know,</v>

349
00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.370
what made me quit was actually seeing all of my friends who were way smarter

350
00:19:40.371 --> 00:19:43.310
than me, uh, quit. They're like I had a friend, uh,

351
00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:47.960
Bob McGrew who quit his PhD at Stanford. And I said, well, you know,

352
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:51.830
Microsoft is a big deal, but you know, PhD at Stanford is a bigger deal. And,

353
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.610
um,

354
00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:56.420
that's kind of what you ended up finding with a lot of these startups is I like

355
00:19:56.421 --> 00:19:59.270
to say that it's kind of like packing a snowball.

356
00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.030
Do you like a nineties,

357
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:07.520
nineties vintage video games? Like for Sony PlayStation?

358
00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.950
I wasn't born, ah. Okay.

359
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:15.170
Okay. There's this game called? Katamari Damacy uh,

360
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:16.820
I think it might be like early two thousands. Maybe.

361
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:19.840
<v 0>That's on the ball. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's basically, yeah.</v>

362
00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:23.510
<v 1>What a startup is like actually a, you start out with this tiny,</v>

363
00:20:23.511 --> 00:20:26.750
like in the game, you're an alien and you're about this high and you know,

364
00:20:26.751 --> 00:20:28.850
you're probably smaller than this, this cap. Right.

365
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:33.590
<v 0>You know, we'll have a prop here actually. Oh yeah, totally. This is all around.</v>

366
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.610
It's rolling around. And then the, the deal is, um.

367
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.940
<v 1>A little alien rolling around a ball and anything that, uh,</v>

368
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:44.930
you are bigger than you pick up and then it becomes a boop like a part of you.

369
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:49.240
And then you can pick up bigger things and anything that is too big and you try

370
00:20:49.241 --> 00:20:52.750
and hit it. Uh, you'll actually bounce off and you'll get smaller.

371
00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:55.630
And that's basically what a startup is all the time.

372
00:20:55.631 --> 00:20:59.110
So getting a first customer hiring your co-founder,

373
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.890
hiring your first engineers, raising your first money. Um,

374
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:06.790
that's all you're doing. Like it's like little bottle caps and things like that,

375
00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.770
sticking onto your ball. And then, you know,

376
00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:13.180
the funny thing about this game is by the last few levels, you know,

377
00:21:13.181 --> 00:21:17.590
you start picking up tables, you pick up like buildings, cars by the end,

378
00:21:17.591 --> 00:21:21.640
you're actually picking up whole continents. And so that's kinda, you know,

379
00:21:21.641 --> 00:21:24.910
startups are basically Katamari Damacy and you know,

380
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.990
that's what you'll find in these patterns. It's like hiring is really important.

381
00:21:28.991 --> 00:21:30.550
Raising money is really important,

382
00:21:30.551 --> 00:21:34.710
but then the most important thing is actually getting customers like that,

383
00:21:34.711 --> 00:21:37.690
that telling that story, well, we'll get you all of the rest. You'll, you know,

384
00:21:37.691 --> 00:21:40.810
you'll get people to drop what they're doing and come join this thing.

385
00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:43.210
Cause Hey, this is a rocket ship. That's about to.

386
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:43.800
<v 2>Gotcha.</v>
