00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.350
<v 0>Welcome to the vlog guy.</v>

2
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.370
So today we are going to talk about the top three programming languages for data

3
00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:07.020
science. And before we do that,

4
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.610
I want to talk about my life because I'm a YouTuber and I'm a narcissist and I

5
00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:16.440
need constant validation from you guys. So a little update, um, I'm in LA now.

6
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.880
So I'm thinking a short vacation because then I felt a little bit burnt out from

7
00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:21.480
work.

8
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.430
So I wanted to chill and do nothing for like a few days and the

9
00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:30.300
perfect person to do that with my brother. We have a special guest,

10
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.110
David ma, and this is what we did when we were here.

11
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.893
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.170
<v 0>But since I'm an aspiring filmmaker, that's how I saw it</v>

13
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.750
Anyways. So I'm going to go back home now, uh,

14
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.350
going to have to go find a scooter so I could scoot back home. Uh,

15
00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:01.184
see you later.

16
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.910
<v 1>They see me rolling. They hate</v>

17
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.330
Petroliana try to catch me

18
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.250
[inaudible] okay. All right.

19
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.960
<v 0>This is my bed. This is the Nintendo switch.</v>

20
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.240
I've been playing a lot of Celeste. Super fun. All right. Let's get started. So,

21
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.240
so I'm going to answer this question real quick,

22
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.910
and I'm going to answer it for data science analytics,

23
00:01:43.911 --> 00:01:45.230
because that's what I know.

24
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.150
So the top three programming languages are Python R and

25
00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:51.680
sequel. That's it?

26
00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:57.643
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

27
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.040
<v 0>And I actually don't even like answering these questions because it's just so</v>

28
00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:04.970
different in terms of the languages and their use case. Like for example,

29
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:06.920
SQL isn't even the programming language,

30
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.100
but I still put it there because it's quite important to have,

31
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.270
or at least to know how to use it, because no matter what data you use,

32
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.860
you have to use something to query it.

33
00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:20.300
So that's SQL and I wouldn't even consider having to learn SQL because it's

34
00:02:20.301 --> 00:02:23.450
basically just the tool to grab data out of the database.

35
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.440
So in some ways it's kind of saying like learning how to use windows, computer,

36
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.560
or learning how to write URLs, to access the internet.

37
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.090
Like I'm exaggerating a little bit, but that's kind of how I feel about it was.

38
00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:37.820
So here's why I chose Python as number one,

39
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.950
Python and R both have the best packages related to stats are the

40
00:02:42.951 --> 00:02:46.580
programming language is basically made for numerical computations.

41
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.900
So that's why ours has a vast range of statistical packages that you can use.

42
00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:53.510
And they're all open sourced, even more so than Python.

43
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.860
But the thing about Python is it wasn't built for numerical computation or for

44
00:02:57.861 --> 00:03:02.170
stats or anything like Python was built for clear programming.

45
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.150
It was built for code readability.

46
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.050
So then Python got more attention from developers. And then because of that,

47
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.490
developers would soon start to develop more frameworks or libraries to support

48
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:16.570
the Python language. Like for example, web frameworks, like flask, Django,

49
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.870
they were all built for Python. And then, because it's so popular,

50
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:22.180
it also drew attention from the stats people.

51
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.240
And they probably really liked the language because it's clean.

52
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.140
So then that's why the stats people started developing, you know, psych kit,

53
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.700
pandas, Jupiter, notebooks, everything that you need to make the disco analysis.

54
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.870
And it's a little bit of a virtuous cycle because the more you have support for

55
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:40.780
numerical computation, the more people will use it.

56
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.610
And because the more people use it,

57
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.240
the more frameworks will be developed and more support it would have.

58
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.940
So for example, TensorFlow for machine learning,

59
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.670
they provided a Python API and a C API.

60
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.700
And the reason they provide a Python API, I'm not sure.

61
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.200
I think it's because Python is so popular amongst the machine learning

62
00:03:59.201 --> 00:04:01.420
developers or set suspicions,

63
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.590
or maybe even the data scientists and quants because Python is already so

64
00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:06.424
Poplar,

65
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.900
then TensorFlow decided to have an API for Python and C.

66
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.610
So basically Python is just super popular and it has tons of resources online

67
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.900
and more and more people I feel are moving away from AR and starting to use

68
00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:23.410
Python for statistical analysis. They use Jupiter notebook.

69
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.940
It's super nice because it's a way to organize your notebooks and a way to

70
00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:32.740
present your analysis are, is still a very, very good option. And I mean,

71
00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:36.700
when you think about it, art is literally built for statistical computing.

72
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.660
So it's pretty good. However, it is less flexible.

73
00:04:40.661 --> 00:04:43.750
Like imagine if suddenly you want to start making websites, you're kind of,

74
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.950
you're not going to make a web backend using AR there's no frameworks for that.

75
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.970
I don't think so. And finally, sequel, you just need it.

76
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.700
You're just going to need it everywhere. No matter what you do it,

77
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:56.050
you don't even need to be a data scientist.

78
00:04:56.051 --> 00:04:59.320
You might be just be a software engineer and you want to query some data for

79
00:04:59.321 --> 00:05:03.070
testing purposes or maybe to validate your feature or something like that.

80
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.590
You're still going to need to pull that data somewhere.

81
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.910
And usually it's from a database and in most database, except for no sequel,

82
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.540
most relational databases, they use SQL as our language.

83
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.740
So you should just know it.

84
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.400
So that's pretty much it that's top three programming languages for data

85
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:22.540
science. Now I just want to thank rom Sans for supporting this channel much,

86
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.370
much appreciated. And also Joshua pop asked, what is one social thing?

87
00:05:27.371 --> 00:05:31.330
And one technical thing you wished you learned in college that would have helped

88
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:34.900
prepare you for the tech industry? Well,

89
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.870
the thing I will say is not super tied to tech industry.

90
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:40.900
It's more about me as a, as a person and my personal growth,

91
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.550
but the one social thing is I wish I was a better leader and

92
00:05:45.551 --> 00:05:47.350
communicator at work.

93
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:52.030
If you take initiative and you communicate really clearly what you're going to

94
00:05:52.031 --> 00:05:55.840
do and what for you'll do a lot better than most new grads,

95
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.390
I was always a bad leader. You know, I,

96
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.270
nobody listens to me and I'm not very assertive.

97
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.050
So I wish that I was better at that. And also, you know,

98
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:10.070
I have sometimes trouble communicating what's on my mind and my ideas,

99
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.940
or even my roadmap to my peers. And then because of that,

100
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.240
I get affected negatively. So I wish I was better at that.

101
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.280
So for the technical thing,

102
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.140
I wish I learned iOS development because if ever I want to quickly prototype an

103
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.760
app or an app idea,

104
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.830
then I can do it a lot easier if I know iOS development and most of the apps

105
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.830
nowadays, they have a mobile component to it.

106
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.110
And because I didn't know how to do iOS development,

107
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:41.000
I couldn't execute on some ideas that I wanted to cause I just suck at front

108
00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:45.290
end programming. And I feel like that's been always my limiting factor.

109
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:49.940
I just really suck at front end development. I can quickly build API APIs or,

110
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:54.350
you know, web back ends with databases and all that, that stuff is simple. Man.

111
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.070
Front end suck so much anyways, before I go,

112
00:06:58.071 --> 00:07:01.370
there's a quick word from our sponsor today, by the way,

113
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:03.770
this video was sponsored by brilliant.org,

114
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.460
which is kind of cool because I actually used trillian.org.

115
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.490
When I was applying to my untitled large company,

116
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.610
since the company gave me links to help me prepare for my interview.

117
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.480
And one of the links that they gave me is a bunch of competent torics questions,

118
00:07:17.481 --> 00:07:20.720
AKA probability questions on brilliant.org.

119
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.740
It really helped me on the map part of the interview because I was killing the

120
00:07:24.741 --> 00:07:25.940
probability questions.

121
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.820
I actually find it really fun to crank out these questions.

122
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.700
It makes me feel good about myself and keeps me sharp.

123
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.280
And they're good brain teasers for interviews,

124
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.200
especially for data science or quantum.

125
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.640
Very good supplement to my interview preps. So highly recommended. Also,

126
00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:41.540
if you're in school,

127
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:45.920
you could supplement your learning by using this website because there's a wide

128
00:07:45.921 --> 00:07:47.930
variety of topics, which is pretty dope.

129
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:52.370
Cause I love the UI on the website and it makes studying so much more fun with

130
00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:54.680
their quizzes. If you're interested,

131
00:07:54.681 --> 00:07:57.470
there's a link in the description down below, best of all,

132
00:07:57.471 --> 00:08:00.620
you can get 20% off their premium subscription. So YouTube,

133
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:04.250
you can kill it at the interview for the large entitled companies.

134
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.930
All right, then that's it for the vlog. I hope you enjoyed this video. Uh,

135
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.080
now I'm just going to add some random clips so that I could extend this video to

136
00:08:12.081 --> 00:08:15.710
10 minutes so I could get more ad revenue. So I guess,

137
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.600
I guess you can watch me play video games or something.

138
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:00.480
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>
