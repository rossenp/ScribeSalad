00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.451
<v 0>So far,</v>

2
00:00:00.451 --> 00:00:05.160
we've seen a 25 new billion dollar startups on pace with lash that could attract

3
00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:09.270
a price tag of $9 billion raised that we just announced this week,

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.790
our $18 million pitch book.

5
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.140
This is shaping up to be the biggest year for uniform IPL.

6
00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:20.220
So you are seeing some private stock market site equity at

7
00:00:20.221 --> 00:00:23.640
$7.2 billion is over

8
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.423
$6 million.

9
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.300
<v 1>My name is Jonathan mot. Uh, people call me Joma and I'm, uh,</v>

10
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.290
starting a startup.

11
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.050
<v 0>What made you decide you want to start a startup?</v>

12
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.330
<v 1>Yeah, well, I've always worked for companies like Facebook, Microsoft, you know,</v>

13
00:00:44.331 --> 00:00:45.320
big tech companies.

14
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.760
And I always had this itch of starting something on my own.

15
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.330
So after working for Buzzfeed, the idea of a startup,

16
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.270
like it was growing on me, you know,

17
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.280
every day I just kept thinking about it and I couldn't stop at the

18
00:01:01.281 --> 00:01:05.750
point where like my visions were so vivid that it was almost like

19
00:01:05.751 --> 00:01:06.584
reality.

20
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.130
<v 0>So about this vision. Can you talk to me a little bit more about that?</v>

21
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.320
Like what is your startup idea?

22
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.290
<v 1>Yeah, it's a, it's a,</v>

23
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.360
it's a tech startup and um, well,

24
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.960
Y man just started, so I don't really have a

25
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.083
[inaudible].

26
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.790
<v 0>Coming up with a startup a year, usually starts with a problem.</v>

27
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.420
<v 1>And that problem is usually when you have yourself.</v>

28
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.830
So that's why today we're going to be thinking about problems. Now,

29
00:01:48.831 --> 00:01:52.820
according to Paul Graham, the co-founder of the seed capital from Y Combinator,

30
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.320
best startup ideas tend to be something that founders want and something they

31
00:01:57.321 --> 00:02:01.190
can build themselves. So what are the advantages of choosing a problem?

32
00:02:01.191 --> 00:02:03.650
You have yourselves. Well, first and foremost,

33
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.740
ensures the problem really exists. And second of all,

34
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.220
it makes it a lot easier for you to develop empathy for your users.

35
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.510
Another important aspect is how much do users need or product.

36
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.620
It's better to have a few people who absolutely need your product than having a

37
00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:20.930
lot of people who might want your product.

38
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.190
Obviously you want to build something that reaches a lot of people and they

39
00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:26.024
really need it.

40
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.530
But most of those ideas are already implemented like Google for searching the

41
00:02:30.531 --> 00:02:35.120
web. That's why having a well-defined problem that real people have is vital for

42
00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:37.970
coming up with a killer startup idea. However,

43
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.590
this requires some research planning, finding potential stakeholders, though.

44
00:02:42.591 --> 00:02:45.590
These are crucial steps for building a successful startup.

45
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.480
Sometimes as an engineer, you just can't help yourself. But to start building,

46
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.290
We were going to Stanford,

47
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.980
we're going to go see what my friends I'm going to see if he's,

48
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.350
if he's interested.

49
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.023
<v 2>And working with me.</v>

50
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.060
<v 1>He's just a sophomore, but, uh, he's a very talented individual.</v>

51
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.700
<v 2>[Inaudible] Stanford home of the unicorn startups,</v>

52
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.110
the Gryffendor of universities, the smarter brother of UCB. What not to love.

53
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.490
Look at that grass. Imagine feeding that grass to cow and then eating that cow.

54
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:48.803
Oh man.

55
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.380
<v 1>Brandon I'm Brandon Tron.</v>

56
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.180
I'm a student at Stanford. I studied some box systems and I do software stuff.

57
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.530
Is this your room? Yeah, this is messy.

58
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.520
I know Joe, after working at Buzzfeed with him, uh,

59
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.420
I was an intern there this summer and he hung out with the interns a lot

60
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.370
anyways. Um, so yeah, I came here to ask you a couple of questions cause uh, I,

61
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.230
she want to talk to you about something.

62
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.210
He came over here to talk to me about a project you wanted to work on.

63
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.010
I got start up date as you know, um, if you saw my video,

64
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.500
uh, I'm starting to yeah. Sorry to start off. So yeah, so it's pretty exciting.

65
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.900
Um, I'm pretty excited about it. What's what's the idea? Well, well, I mean,

66
00:05:48.901 --> 00:05:51.810
like, I don't have like a full idea yet and like,

67
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.430
I'm still kind of like working on that.

68
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.370
Like one of the reasons why I don't want to talk about it is like,

69
00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.260
I don't really think I should talk about it, you know, on camera. So,

70
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.700
so I think, okay, so I'll just tell you that. Okay.

71
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.053
Yeah. So we

72
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.790
kind of idea, but uh,

73
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.010
I think Joel was a pretty smart dude, so, uh,

74
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.940
we'll see. Uh, it's an idea, but like, okay. Like,

75
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.560
would you use it for example? I doubt it,

76
00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.850
but, but, but, but you're not the target demographic, you know, but yeah,

77
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.080
no, you're not. Okay. Well, I mean, obviously you're not,

78
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.930
since you don't think you would use it, but like imagine if it does succeed,

79
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.320
think about how awesome it is or, you know yeah.

80
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.420
That's exceed. It would be really cool. It would be pretty Epic.

81
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.090
Like I could see it shouldn't do it. It's like,

82
00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.270
you don't always want to be the co-founder of something,

83
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.100
especially in this space where it's like, it's a hit or miss,

84
00:07:03.101 --> 00:07:07.570
so it could just be the headline, like, yo, this startup kind of sucks.

85
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.630
Personally. I do want you to drop out, you know,

86
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.530
because you do know that people who drop out of Stanford have a 50% higher

87
00:07:14.531 --> 00:07:18.520
chance of being a founder of a huge IPO unicorn.

88
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.210
I feel company, I would think, I don't think that's true. I mean like,

89
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.650
think about it, you know, you've got, you know, Snapchat. Okay. Um,

90
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.150
uh, so, so,

91
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.240
so I guess like you don't think you can like put in a hundred percent kind of a

92
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.380
thing. Yeah. Probably not. It seems like a really redundant idea.

93
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.780
Think something that's kind of already been done before, so yeah. Right, right.

94
00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:48.230
Okay. Yeah. Uh, yeah.

95
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.370
I asked if you talked with her for that and it's free dinner. Oh yeah. Sure,

96
00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:55.900
sure. Okay. Well I guess, uh, well like yeah, like just think about it,

97
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:59.500
you know, sleep on it and uh, yeah. But like thanks for,

98
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.650
thanks for letting me know. But, uh, all right. Yes.

99
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.350
So I'm excited to see where it goes. Yeah.

100
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:07.463
<v 3>Yeah, no worries.</v>

101
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.790
<v 1>But I would want to help out on the video stuff.</v>

102
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:16.630
Maybe I got pretty interested in that. Yeah. I think it was a cool concept.

103
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.570
Wait, like you want to do like the video stuff,

104
00:08:19.571 --> 00:08:22.150
like you mean like the blog that I'm doing, right? Yeah.

105
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.150
I think that's a cool concept. Yeah, sure. I mean like,

106
00:08:25.151 --> 00:08:27.850
just like on a production standpoint. Well, I mean,

107
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.400
like if that's what you're interested, like I definitely need help on that.

108
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:35.260
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm done. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, because I have no one right now.

109
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:40.240
Oh yeah, yeah. No, that'd be super helpful. Yeah. All right. Cool. Cool. Cool.

110
00:08:40.241 --> 00:08:42.550
Yeah. Nice. All right. Sweet.

111
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.230
<v 3>Despite not being able to convince my friend to be a co-founder,</v>

112
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:51.190
at least I know that people are still willing to help in some form.

113
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.550
Maybe finding a co-founder just, isn't the best thing to do right now.

114
00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.070
Maybe the best thing to do.

115
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.260
<v 4>Right now is just to keep grinding.</v>
