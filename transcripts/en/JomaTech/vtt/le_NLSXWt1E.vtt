<v 0>[Inaudible] Oh, Steve jobs, autobiography.</v>

2
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.973
Hello everyone.

3
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370
<v 1>Buddy.</v>

4
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.620
So today we are going to talk about five tips to increasing your productivity.

5
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.450
Tip number one, leverage the power of habits to build productive routines.

6
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.210
I asked the guys for book recommendations on Twitter,

7
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.330
and one of the books I got was the power of habit.

8
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.240
Now I actually started listening to the audio book of it,

9
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.170
and I thought it was really interesting because it helped me understand how I

10
00:00:57.171 --> 00:00:59.030
became more productive in the past year.

11
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.620
And now that I can pinpoint that it was because I was building a habit out of

12
00:01:03.621 --> 00:01:08.000
the things I wanted to be productive on that I was able to make a routine and

13
00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:12.350
start cranking out code videos, work stuff, you name it. Now,

14
00:01:12.351 --> 00:01:17.150
essentially we want to do is for the next 21 days, do something every day.

15
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.410
This could be coding flossing or whatever you want that you think is productive.

16
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.830
And after 21 days, it will be so hard for you to stop.

17
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.780
That will become second nature to you. Tip number two, start multitasking,

18
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.280
the mundane stuff for things that doesn't require much concentration to do,

19
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.010
do something else that's more productive while you do that.

20
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.340
It would save you surprisingly a lot of time. For example,

21
00:01:40.341 --> 00:01:44.720
when I clean my room or do something super boring, I usually do not like at all,

22
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.290
I would just, you know, whip out an audio book and just start listening to it.

23
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.160
And that way I can actually learn stuff while I do those mundane tasks.

24
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.370
Another example would be when I brush my teeth,

25
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.390
I would read emails or I would check my social media accounts.

26
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.350
And then little by little, I'm actually saving a lot of time in the long run

27
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.200
tip number three,

28
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.970
keep yourself busy and accountable with deadlines and stakeholders. Now,

29
00:02:10.971 --> 00:02:15.350
one of the things I like to do is actually to fill out my calendar with lots of

30
00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:17.360
focus, blocks and deadlines.

31
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.490
That way I barely have time to procrastinate the deadlines I set for myself,

32
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.990
or even better that I promised to other people will keep me accountable for

33
00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:28.700
actually completing the projects.

34
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.630
That way I can't procrastinate because I just have a lot to finish.

35
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.120
And a lot of people are dependent on me to finish them.

36
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.490
Tip number four when taking a break, don't think about work. Just have fun.

37
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.120
This is important because I see a lot of people have faster productive time,

38
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.480
but they also have faster fun time. For example,

39
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.690
I see a lot of people studying while watching TV shows.

40
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.660
That's terrible because you end up not enjoying the show nor learning the things

41
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.400
or trying to learn. So when I give myself a break,

42
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.710
I make sure I don't think about anything else. I love TV shows.

43
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.280
So I turn off my phone and immerse myself and surprisingly,

44
00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:09.700
you'll actually learn a lot more by doing that. Like for example,

45
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.320
I love to watch K-pop videos and actually learn a lot of cinematography by

46
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:16.870
dissecting these videos and just focusing on it.

47
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.960
But if I was coding while watching these K-pop videos,

48
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.640
I'd never appreciate them as much. Tip number five, exercise,

49
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.870
exercise, exercise. Now I'm a big fan of weightlifting.

50
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:30.160
So I might be biased here,

51
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.000
but I truly believe that exercising will make you sharper.

52
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.990
Exercising helps you relieve stress because it releases endorphins,

53
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.150
which are feel good hormones.

54
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.950
That way allows you to refresh your mind and be a lot more productive throughout

55
00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:47.350
the day. It doesn't even need to be super-intense.

56
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.520
As long as you get your heart rate up and work on moving your body more,

57
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.710
you'll feel the benefits right away.

58
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.720
Exercise is a powerful habit and can be a good primer to, you know,

59
00:03:58.721 --> 00:04:01.330
teaching you to how to build these productive habits.

60
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.440
So I highly recommend going to the gym or exercising regularly.

61
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.360
So in conclusion,

62
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.080
the most important point I want to get across is that if you really want to be

63
00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:14.230
good at something, or you want to change an aspect of your life,

64
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.350
then make it a habit. Now you might say, Oh yeah,

65
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.460
it's not as easy as it sounds though. And you're absolutely right. You know,

66
00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:25.030
building habits extremely hard and I find it hard myself,

67
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.360
but if you really care about the thing you want to achieve,

68
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.310
then you will put the effort into it.

69
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.910
And that's why I want to keep myself accountable for what I say.

70
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.680
And I want you guys to join me.

71
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.310
So basically choose something that you always wanted to do or something that you

72
00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:44.020
want to get good at and together we'll make it a new habit. So for me,

73
00:04:44.021 --> 00:04:47.440
this is running. I hate running every aspect of it.

74
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.670
I'm also extremely bad at it, but that's also why I want to work on it.

75
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.300
I want to have better cardio. And since I hate running the most,

76
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.480
I want to confront it. And if I can make running a habit,

77
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.160
then it gives me the confidence that in the future, I can make anything happen.

78
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.550
I also want to thank audible for sponsoring this video.

79
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.900
And I wanted to also recommend the audio book, the power of habit,

80
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.180
which I talked a lot about in this video.

81
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.560

84
00:05:26.321 --> 00:05:30.220
habits. And it's great. Cause now why run this summer? I can listen to it.

85
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.210
So I don't need to sit down and have a dedicated reading time. Uh,
