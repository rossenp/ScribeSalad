00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.200
<v 0>So that's a good question. Like how do people usually get into PM?</v>

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.880
I tried to get into PM. Did you know that I tried to get into RPM,

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.420
Facebook or APN, like Google, I didn't get those roles,

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.780
but then if you don't get those roles, how do you get into debt?

5
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.660
So I think there's two. Yeah.

6
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.160
There's two ways that I think like people can get into product, right?

7
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:22.800
Like one is like join a program where it's like, there is no,

8
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.020
there's no prerequisite for how much experience you have.

9
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:28.170
So like all the big companies have rotational programs and product.

10
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.350
The problem is, is there's like, because there's no prerequisites,

11
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:34.920
there's 20,000 people applying for 10 slots, right? It's just like,

12
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.250
it's like almost like harder to get into the college and to get into these roles

13
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.240
and everything into college.

14
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.600
<v 1>Before we continued as video. I just want to say,</v>

15
00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:46.520
thank you so much to air table for sponsoring this video air table allows people

Have you ever used air table before?

35
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.990
<v 2>I have, I actually, I, when I was working on box,</v>

36
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.250
when she worked with really irritate the build integration, we had how he,

37
00:02:04.251 --> 00:02:07.850
the CEO come in and talk at our Friday lunch. Um,

38
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.820
but in general I was on the company. It was really small,

39
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.950
but now it's like been growing like crazy.

40
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.220
<v 0>Yeah. Welcome to the show, man. It's been a while.</v>

41
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.410
Yeah. All right.

42
00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:28.880
So I brought you in today because you're a product manager at Fang,

43
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.250
right. So why don't you just give me a short introduction of yourself? Yeah,

44
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.050
so I saw Andre, um,

45
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.060
I've been about a PM for maybe four or so years.

46
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.980
I studied, I grew up in, on the bark. I studied, uh, management,

47
00:02:45.981 --> 00:02:50.270
science and engineering at Stanford, did a couple of startups, uh, during,

48
00:02:50.271 --> 00:02:53.990
when I was interning. Um, so I did one at a company called Smule,

49
00:02:53.991 --> 00:02:56.240
which is a social music company, um,

50
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.500
most famous for the IMT pain app on the phone,

51
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.370
the first one to use the microphone as, um,

52
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:06.670
an instrument to second hour, put a company called like reputation.com,

53
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.500
which was more of like a privacy type company.

54
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.610
They did a little bit of kind of more data analytics type work. Um,

55
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.650
and my junior year, I decided I wanted to just see what SMA was all about,

56
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.100
uh, and sold out for a little bit and did a summer.

57
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:23.020
I had been invested in anymore. Stanley.

58
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.640
Is that when you started falling arbitrage and yeah. Babies? Um,

59
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.940
I definitely understand those jokes, but I just realized at that point,

60
00:03:30.941 --> 00:03:34.270
I just wasn't necessarily kind of right. For me. Um,

61
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.310
there was a lot of like client service type work.

62
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:38.980
So you already worked on behalf of someone else instead of building your own

63
00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:41.530
things yourself. And based on my other jobs,

64
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:43.420
I always realized that like becoming,

65
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.470
being a PM is all about like building things and I wanted to get back to

66
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:48.071
building things.

67
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:52.210
And so that's kind of where I was and I was kind of the goal I wanted to get to

68
00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:54.370
is like, how do I start building and having to go to PM?

69
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.170
So the first PM job would be where, yeah,

70
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.890
first I'm job I had was at box, but I didn't start as you know.

71
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.990
And then your second PM job is at Facebook. Okay. Nice. Nice.

72
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.980
Who have you worked with at Facebook? I've worked with Jomo.

73
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.430
Jomo was my data scientist at Facebook. He was one to 10.

74
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.970
He got stuff done. You can say the truth. I'll just edit all the bad stuff.

75
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.400
Okay. So I'm just going to stick to the script this time,

76
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.620
because a lot of people tell me that I talk too much during these interviews and

77
00:04:31.621 --> 00:04:35.340
you're like, shut the up. Joma I'm going to stick to the script. Alright. Okay.

78
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.350
So what does it feel like to be silicon's Valley's most eligible guy

79
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.960
and you you're speaking those words out, man. No, it's true.

80
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.470
All my viewers are like, Oh my God. All right.

81
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.200
Let's get to the real penal stuff. So yeah.

82
00:04:52.201 --> 00:04:57.150
So you told me that he did IB investment backing and then you switched to

83
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.720
PMO right before ID. You were killing it there. Yeah. Yeah.

84
00:05:00.721 --> 00:05:03.600
I did a ton of things. It was mostly worked. It's tech startups. Yeah.

85
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.890
Was box the first full time job you started out. Okay.

86
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.410
So you were at the house? Yeah. So I actually did a lot of steps,

87
00:05:10.411 --> 00:05:12.210
but there's a lot of different things at box.

88
00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:15.870
I joined the team that was like a step within box. I did like,

89
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.810
I did develop a marketing. I did partnerships, data analytics.

90
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.090
I did comms to such a phase. It was a small team.

91
00:05:21.091 --> 00:05:24.450
Everyone had to kind of work on everything from box office as a small company

92
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.673
and the team within.

93
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.620
So I helping build out our developer platforms C and so it was like probably

94
00:05:28.621 --> 00:05:31.560
five or six people within that, whereas our own business unit.

95
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.180
So I ended up doing kind of all the ranges of work just based on what we

96
00:05:36.181 --> 00:05:40.230
needed. Um, but wasn't, and I did product stuff, but I wasn't a product manager,

97
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.490
but at the end you were product within.

98
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.490
So what I did was I knew I wanted to do it,

99
00:05:44.491 --> 00:05:47.700
but I guess if you have is in general, it's like, there aren't that many roles,

100
00:05:47.701 --> 00:05:51.180
especially for people that are coming without a PM experience. Yeah.

101
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.260
So that's a good question. Like how do people usually get into PM?

102
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.000
I tried to get into PM. Did you know.

103
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.910
<v 1>I tried to get into RPM, Facebook or APM, like Google,</v>

104
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.110
I didn't get those roles, but then if you don't get those roles, how do you get?

105
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.730
<v 0>Yeah. So I think there's two. Yeah.</v>

106
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.230
There's two ways that I think like people can get into product, right?

107
00:06:11.231 --> 00:06:13.840
Like one is like joining a program where it's like, there is no,

108
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.060
there's no prerequisite for how much experience you have.

109
00:06:16.061 --> 00:06:19.240
So like all the big companies have rotational programs with product.

110
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.390
The problem is, is there is like, because there's no prerequisites,

111
00:06:22.391 --> 00:06:25.990
there's 20,000 people applying for 10 slots. Right. It's just like,

112
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.290
it's like almost like harder to get into the college and to get into these roles

113
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.213
that it is going into college.

114
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.700
<v 1>Do you know the numbers for RPM APM acceptance?</v>

115
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.990
<v 0>Uh, no. I think just in terms of sheer numbers, like I would imagine,</v>

116
00:06:37.991 --> 00:06:42.880
like how many does the Facebook hire? I think it's around like 14, 14,

117
00:06:42.881 --> 00:06:45.880
14 to 20, maybe every year or per quarter. Uh,

118
00:06:45.881 --> 00:06:48.310
I think it's almost per maybe increase more, but when I first started,

119
00:06:48.311 --> 00:06:51.670
I was like 14 per year. That's great. And so if you think about it, it's like,

120
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.630
it's like just the numbers aren't in your favor to start in a way that like a

121
00:06:55.631 --> 00:06:58.630
lot of people have done it in a way that I tell people that they want to get

122
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.600
into product is like, there's two other pathways. One is like,

123
00:07:01.601 --> 00:07:05.770
you work at a company in another role and then build up your kind of background,

124
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:08.890
all of your reputation of the company and then transition it,

125
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.860
transitioned laterally in the company to product. If there is an opening,

126
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.200
just because everyone knows that you're a known quantity.

127
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.360
People know if you're doing well,

128
00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.940
like they're more likely to define the product role. And the second one is like,

129
00:07:18.941 --> 00:07:22.330
you can probably try to find a really small startup and start to just do other

130
00:07:22.331 --> 00:07:26.380
things, including product. Um, but I would say the easiest way,

131
00:07:26.381 --> 00:07:29.470
but also it's not the most direct way is to do it within a company that

132
00:07:29.471 --> 00:07:33.610
transition in that product role. Right. Um, and then once you are at once,

133
00:07:33.611 --> 00:07:35.560
you are like, uh, in the product role, it becomes,

134
00:07:35.561 --> 00:07:38.220
it opens up a lot of pathways because you have some experiences.

135
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.690
<v 1>Immature. So before becoming a PMO,</v>

136
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.600
what are the best jobs to transition into PMs?

137
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.720
<v 0>And this is not me knocking any of like the rotational programs,</v>

138
00:07:46.721 --> 00:07:49.750
but if you start as a PM right out of college, like it's great.

139
00:07:49.751 --> 00:07:50.770
You become a really good PM,

140
00:07:50.771 --> 00:07:53.440
but you're really focused on doing something the first way you learned it.

141
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.140
Right? So if you work at Google, you work at Facebook,

142
00:07:56.141 --> 00:07:59.350
but you learned to do a PM's job that way. And that's what your role,

143
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.290
what you think of PM. Or we think of other functions, then you can be a good PM.

144
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.040
But I think to become like a really great PM, which I think I'm still working,

145
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:10.060
working towards is it's almost like it's, it's definitely more,

146
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.870
I would encourage people to go work in other functions that are that help

147
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:17.230
support product anyways. Like they could be analytics, it could be marketing,

148
00:08:17.231 --> 00:08:19.180
it could be communication could be sales, right.

149
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.960
And you build empathy around like how other people work with products.

150
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.400
So when to become a product manager,

151
00:08:24.401 --> 00:08:27.970
you understand how all these other functions tie together to become like a

152
00:08:27.971 --> 00:08:31.210
really, really good product manager that sees the whole picture. Right.

153
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.820
Instead of just a narrow piece of building product. Right.

154
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:38.320
But I think like in general, there is no real like, like stepping stone.

155
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.550
I don't think there really is.

156
00:08:39.551 --> 00:08:42.220
I think like hands on with the skills that you want,

157
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:44.230
it's been one depends on the company brighter,

158
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:48.400
but it depends also depends on the skills that you want to develop as a PM.

159
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.600
Cause there's so many different types of things.

160
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.730
<v 1>That's true. Like 1:00 PM can,</v>

161
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.090
can totally have a different skillset than another one.

162
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.310
If you want to be a super technical.

163
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.430
<v 0>PM, like yeah. It might be really helpful to have it sweet. You might. Yeah.</v>

164
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:01.710
You might have, if you're a software engineer, you work in data,

165
00:09:01.711 --> 00:09:05.100
like it'd be really helpful to get really nitty-gritty with technical details.

166
00:09:05.101 --> 00:09:08.910
But if you're doing something that's more like consumer facing or a little bit

167
00:09:08.911 --> 00:09:09.721
abstracting away,

168
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:13.560
like having communicate good communication skills and being able to problem

169
00:09:13.561 --> 00:09:16.110
solve and think deeply about a problem is even more important.

170
00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:20.460
So it doesn't matter where like what job you had before. Um,

171
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.380
I think the one thing to note is like, you don't like,

172
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:26.130
I I've taken computer science classes. Like I understand like how to code,

173
00:09:26.131 --> 00:09:28.530
but by no means I am technical.

174
00:09:28.531 --> 00:09:30.660
And so like some of the best teams that I know are,

175
00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:33.420
have no technical backgrounds and they just learn.

176
00:09:33.421 --> 00:09:36.660
And they're curious about like diving deep and understanding a problem that

177
00:09:36.661 --> 00:09:39.380
like, it doesn't matter if they're don't right. Okay.

178
00:09:39.381 --> 00:09:44.330
But if you had to choose like one job that is the easiest to transition into PM,

179
00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.990
let's say at Facebook, because since you're there for awhile,

180
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.980
like which shop do you see most often in general? Let's see. I mean,

181
00:09:51.981 --> 00:09:53.930
software engineering, you see, there are three types of,

182
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.900
I think you got to do software engineers too. Yeah.

183
00:09:56.901 --> 00:09:59.340
There's some software engineers that turn into PMs if they don't, if,

184
00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:01.970
if they want to start like building things and managing people,

185
00:10:01.971 --> 00:10:05.120
I don't think it's super common. I think data,

186
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:08.780
people who are dating and data, um, data analytics, data science,

187
00:10:08.781 --> 00:10:12.340
like having a herring grasp of like data and how it's used our decisions.

188
00:10:12.341 --> 00:10:14.810
So I think it's in there, you see a lot of people that transition.

189
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:19.400
I twin I have a twin brother that's also a PM would do the 4:00 PM.

190
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:23.000
He was an analytics scientist. Um, and for them it's easy.

191
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.100
Cause you can see the data trends. So you're at least, you know,

192
00:10:25.101 --> 00:10:27.410
how to dig apart and form hypothesis.

193
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:29.660
The other one is I think even if you're in product marketing, right?

194
00:10:29.661 --> 00:10:33.440
Like you're so close to the product that like you understand customer needs.

195
00:10:33.441 --> 00:10:37.130
So if you're really empathize empathy with the customer or their user,

196
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.680
like it's much easier to become a PM because you already have that

197
00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:43.910
understanding. That's true because it's so hard to kind of, um,

198
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.660
rate different PMs because you're saying like every PM does really different

199
00:10:47.661 --> 00:10:51.860
things. So what makes like good Pampers is a great pan, like you said. Yeah.

200
00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:52.510
I think it gives, you know,

201
00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:55.460
someone that can just execute well on like the vision, right?

202
00:10:55.461 --> 00:10:58.630
Like you have a roadmap, you execute you on block. Um,

203
00:10:58.631 --> 00:11:00.380
and you just marched towards like your level.

204
00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.480
I think a great PM does a couple of things.

205
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:07.430
One can help like really strategize around what is the next thing that's coming.

206
00:11:07.431 --> 00:11:10.460
So think ahead of the box. So like if you plan in like six months,

207
00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:13.010
like you're working towards that six month, good line.

208
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.680
But you're also understanding like in the next six months of what do we indeed

209
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:19.670
build? And so you're always thinking ahead of how these products can,

210
00:11:19.671 --> 00:11:21.230
that can scale further.

211
00:11:21.231 --> 00:11:23.780
I think the second thing is around like just communication.

212
00:11:23.781 --> 00:11:27.100
I think if you can communicate and set context,

213
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.890
Cod different contexts settings across like all the different functions,

214
00:11:30.891 --> 00:11:34.220
like engineering and product marketing privacy, right?

215
00:11:34.221 --> 00:11:38.530
Like I think it makes a light you're like really easy to unblock your team. Um,

216
00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:42.280
and getting under people buy and understand why you're doing something. Um,

217
00:11:42.281 --> 00:11:45.500
and I think the last thing it's always really helps to be really fluid and data

218
00:11:45.501 --> 00:11:48.380
and understand like, honestly, with writing your own queries,

219
00:11:48.381 --> 00:11:51.470
it's great to write your own queries if you can. But, um,

220
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.850
I didn't do anything with, I had a piano. I did it myself.

221
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:58.170
It was great with data. So you see something go up,

222
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.620
you have to understand why it goes up and being able to break apart and

223
00:12:01.621 --> 00:12:03.930
understand exactly why the, with the lovers are,

224
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:07.470
it makes you just really develop good product intuition to understand like,

225
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:10.230
this is why these things are happening. Cause then it's like, ah,

226
00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:12.630
it's just luck. And then it can help reinforce what you want to do.

227
00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:17.910
So even as a good PM, you know, you say you have to execute well, but it's,

228
00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:21.330
it's kind of hard to, I at least for some people to grasp, what,

229
00:12:21.331 --> 00:12:24.780
what does it actually mean to execute like their day, right? Like what,

230
00:12:24.781 --> 00:12:28.230
like why is it hard to execute? You just ask someone to do something,

231
00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:32.130
ask someone to do for it's easy, right? Or is it it's actually, I mean,

232
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.730
I would assume it's easy there, but as you're working, you're not working,

233
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:38.460
you're going to run functions or you're a design or with engineering,

234
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:39.210
you're going to data.

235
00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:42.510
You don't need the research and eat for each project that you have potentially,

236
00:12:42.511 --> 00:12:45.300
you might have different asks for each of them. Right.

237
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.700
And so for maybe your scope, you're starting out a project,

238
00:12:47.701 --> 00:12:51.480
you need research and design to start like lead the way before you can help

239
00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:53.250
scope out some family engineering side.

240
00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.640
And so it was getting the timelines and land to like understand what the

241
00:12:56.641 --> 00:13:00.000
sequencing of every project is to make sure everyone's getting their deadlines.

242
00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:03.630
And so it's making sure different teams work together so that each team has what

243
00:13:03.631 --> 00:13:08.430
they need in order to go build the product. And then once people are building,

244
00:13:08.431 --> 00:13:10.650
it's like, there's always the roadblocks that come up.

245
00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.800
And then it's how you unblock that to you. If it's working with another team,

246
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:14.341
it's like,

247
00:13:14.341 --> 00:13:18.120
how do you get that team to do what you want and unblocking your team so they

248
00:13:18.121 --> 00:13:21.300
can continue to execute. So like, it's a lot of like people management skills,

249
00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:26.040
but also just like a lot of like trying to influence, um,

250
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:28.410
to get things done. Yeah. Get done.

251
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.460
So as a great product manager, like you are,

252
00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:37.500
are there any like anecdotes or actually a concrete things like tips

253
00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:41.850
that you can give to product manager on how to influence people or how to, uh,

254
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.600
align people to better? Yeah. I think that'd be,

255
00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:49.440
I think the bigger thing is like, it's how do you set shared goals? It's like,

256
00:13:49.441 --> 00:13:52.170
if you have your team is working on one thing and another team is working on

257
00:13:52.171 --> 00:13:54.920
another thing. Like if those goals are not aligned,

258
00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.520
like people are not going to work together.

259
00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.760
And so it's framing a problem saying like, this is the goal we're trying to do.

260
00:13:59.761 --> 00:14:01.080
This is how it helps you. This is how,

261
00:14:01.081 --> 00:14:04.320
what you're doing helps us make sure that like everyone's like aligned and

262
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.770
incentivized or work on the same thing. When those things don't work.

263
00:14:07.771 --> 00:14:11.970
Then like you always have this fight of trying to like escalate it and say, Oh,

264
00:14:11.971 --> 00:14:14.190
this, this, like, this seems not doing what we want them to do.

265
00:14:14.191 --> 00:14:15.480
And it becomes contentious.

266
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:18.540
And so I think it's more about how do you operate a good working model,

267
00:14:18.541 --> 00:14:22.050
get people bought in to light and what the success is and say it upfront what

268
00:14:22.051 --> 00:14:25.410
the success is to make sure. And then align like commitments.

269
00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.140
They get people to actually like do things on time.

270
00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.960
Cause everything requires a lot of work across different teams,

271
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.910
kind of a niche question. But what do you think matters more, uh,

272
00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:40.020
relationships with these different teams to make them do stuff or

273
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:42.510
incentives? Uh, I think they go with the hand in hand.

274
00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:44.280
I think that like you can't say one or the other,

275
00:14:44.281 --> 00:14:48.870
I think incentivizing a team through like the right shared goals builds helps

276
00:14:48.871 --> 00:14:53.630
build your relationship. Um, cause, um, I mean, when I was a data scientist,

277
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:58.970
I did a lot of favors to PM's that like more that's it like?

278
00:14:58.971 --> 00:15:01.130
So it's not necessarily incentives. I feel like,

279
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:05.060
I don't know if incentives work as well on me than like relationship.

280
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.990
I'm sure it's different for me if we were to say, but if you were to say like,

281
00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:13.510
I can help you hit your goal quicker and it's yeah,

282
00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.760
exactly what I say. No, you have a personal, bigger team, right?

283
00:15:15.761 --> 00:15:17.110
Like saying like, okay,

284
00:15:17.111 --> 00:15:19.750
we can get to this point 20% quicker or we don't work together.

285
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:20.620
Like that's incentive.

286
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.530
The other one is our relationships are more because once you build that trust,

287
00:15:23.531 --> 00:15:27.130
like people are willing to like then spend time because they know that it's

288
00:15:27.131 --> 00:15:30.370
worth it. So you get both. How much do you make as a PM?

289
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:34.000
How many hours do you a profile of a lot

290
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:39.550
YouTube questions on various in various areas.

291
00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:44.830
I think the one thing good thing about being a PM is that you can get

292
00:15:44.831 --> 00:15:48.940
good Dodge. We're going to give you, it's like, you can, you can make your own,

293
00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:51.850
like you can work on things the way you want to work on it. Right. There's no,

294
00:15:51.851 --> 00:15:54.550
like I need to ship this thing by this.

295
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.000
Or there might be an artificial deadline someplace that you work towards,

296
00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:00.310
but it's essentially how you sequence that work.

297
00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.250
And so there's no like routine day in some days,

298
00:16:03.251 --> 00:16:04.870
it's like we have a deadline to hit.

299
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:07.180
We work really hard and other days it's more of like, okay,

300
00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.990
we're just scoping out things like we have time and you can kind of relax.

301
00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.920
And so I think it depends on the, just the project itself,

302
00:16:14.921 --> 00:16:17.770
but it's also nice because like for other roles, like if you go to banking,

303
00:16:17.771 --> 00:16:22.390
right, like you have a client that needs something before you even start on it.

304
00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.030
And so you're working hard nonstop and they keep coming in,

305
00:16:25.031 --> 00:16:27.280
whereas a PM you're managing your own team.

306
00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:30.400
And so you can manage those deadlines and those timelines. So it's much easier.

307
00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:34.210
I'm sorry. I didn't, I couldn't, I couldn't get the money.

308
00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:41.230
You may give me a range so that they, it depends on what your range is just like

309
00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:47.500
age or else I would say is less than a typical software

310
00:16:47.501 --> 00:16:51.390
engineer. Okay. Um, Oh yeah. Actually that's good. I'd say less, I suppose,

311
00:16:51.391 --> 00:16:54.850
software engineer, but it's con it's honorable software.

312
00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.680
Did you think it was a very different,

313
00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:00.820
your role as a product manager in box versus Facebook? Yes.

314
00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:04.120
Like at night Maya was vastly different. I, in two things,

315
00:17:04.121 --> 00:17:07.780
I think one it's like working in an enterprise company versus consumer and our

316
00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:08.321
breasts company,

317
00:17:08.321 --> 00:17:12.010
things are dictated more around like your customers that you're selling to.

318
00:17:12.011 --> 00:17:15.430
So as much as much more clear about the things you need to build,

319
00:17:15.431 --> 00:17:19.360
it's more about prioritization of how long it takes to build. Um,

320
00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:20.950
and like what the cost is. Right?

321
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:24.490
Cause you only have a handful of clients or if you have like a box,

322
00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:26.890
you have like 75,000 customers, bank customers.

323
00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:31.030
But it's like at that point it's like an enterprise is pretty well with the

324
00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.650
problems are, Oh yeah, I did.

325
00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:34.870
They're pretty vocal because they're paying and they're paying.

326
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.450
And the goal is like, how do you unlock? Can you sell this deal?

327
00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:40.030
So it's much easier to say like, here's like,

328
00:17:40.031 --> 00:17:43.270
here's the top things that we need to do is closest to you and you figure it out

329
00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:46.270
across all your customers, like what you do and you just execute and build.

330
00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:49.180
It's tough because it's more, it's a little bit more technical type problems.

331
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:52.320
Um, and there's a lot more like there's a lot more stakeholders in it.

332
00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.520
<v 1>The interview process, like for PMs.</v>

333
00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:57.680
<v 0>Maybe processes, it can go a couple of ways.</v>

334
00:17:57.681 --> 00:17:59.600
I think one at a company that's like big,

335
00:17:59.601 --> 00:18:03.290
like Facebook or Google and those in New Jersey and you are interviewing for

336
00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:06.260
like a general role, right? Like you're not integrated with the ski team.

337
00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.000
It's pretty structured. It's like you like,

338
00:18:08.001 --> 00:18:12.650
how well can you break down a product of brilliant ambiguous product problem?

339
00:18:12.651 --> 00:18:17.150
Like for example, how do you build a better camera? Right?

340
00:18:17.151 --> 00:18:19.670
Like it's just, that's, that's what would be like the prompt.

341
00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.580
And you have to understand like how to break it down and put a framework in

342
00:18:22.581 --> 00:18:26.030
place. Cool. The second one is how well you use data. It's like, okay,

343
00:18:26.031 --> 00:18:28.370
this number is dropping. Like how would you debug it?

344
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:29.450
Or how would you set a goal.

345
00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:33.620
<v 1>Actually, before we go into data, can we just make it more concrete?</v>

346
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:37.220
Maybe we can make an example. So how do you create a better camera?

347
00:18:37.221 --> 00:18:38.510
So how would you answer that if you.

348
00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:40.370
<v 0>Yeah, I think the question is, is like,</v>

349
00:18:40.371 --> 00:18:44.930
I mean the way the structure you usually would take would be like, what is like,

350
00:18:44.931 --> 00:18:47.150
you would start out like, Oh, what is the goal of the whole thing? Right?

351
00:18:47.151 --> 00:18:48.560
Like what's the goal of the camera?

352
00:18:48.561 --> 00:18:50.660
Like what's what are you trying to accomplish?

353
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:54.410
And then it's like potentially like setting like a metric,

354
00:18:54.411 --> 00:18:56.900
like what does success for this camera look like?

355
00:18:56.901 --> 00:19:01.430
Is it selling more as getting people to use more features? Right. Like, um,

356
00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:05.090
and then I think it's totally all about like understanding who the users are,

357
00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.810
who are the users and what are their needs, what are they looking for?

358
00:19:08.811 --> 00:19:11.960
Is it like, if it's just like a basic point and shoot to capture memories,

359
00:19:11.961 --> 00:19:13.430
like people don't care about quality.

360
00:19:13.431 --> 00:19:17.420
They care about just the ease and quickness of like taking a photo cares about

361
00:19:17.421 --> 00:19:19.940
like ridiculous quality. It's like, okay,

362
00:19:19.941 --> 00:19:21.800
maybe it's something that's a very different. Right.

363
00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.240
And then it's understanding like,

364
00:19:23.241 --> 00:19:25.670
what are the features that help address those needs? So like,

365
00:19:25.671 --> 00:19:27.050
what are the things that you would build?

366
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:30.140
And then it's all about understanding at that point. Like prioritization.

367
00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.740
Like if you have a finite set of resources, how would you prioritize something?

368
00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:34.971
Um, it's more of like,

369
00:19:34.971 --> 00:19:38.330
how do you structure breakdown that point rather than what the question or the

370
00:19:38.331 --> 00:19:39.164
problem.

371
00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:40.070
<v 1>Yeah. That's nice.</v>

372
00:19:40.071 --> 00:19:43.490
I feel like structure is really important in these interviews. For example,

373
00:19:43.491 --> 00:19:47.090
when, when you asked me like, Oh, how do you make a camera better?

374
00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.910
But then you start breaking down, like before, what you know,

375
00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:54.270
is it for professionals or is it for, uh, like which, which audience.

376
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:56.630
<v 0>Because the problem that people have all the time is they jumped straight to the</v>

377
00:19:56.631 --> 00:19:58.610
solution. It's like, Oh, the camera, like, uh,

378
00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.150
the lens or it must be the quality, but there's no way to say like,

379
00:20:02.151 --> 00:20:03.310
why are you already doing it?

380
00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.100
<v 1>Like you have to really know who your target audiences exactly.</v>

381
00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:12.260
And then make sure in the interview, you really ask them more questions. Right?

382
00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:14.810
Yeah. You have to ask a lot of questions. That's like a conversation,

383
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.080
the exact cool. Awesome. And then the data side. Yeah.

384
00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:23.180
<v 0>It's more like, okay, you see numbers going down, like why? Or it's like, Oh,</v>

385
00:20:23.181 --> 00:20:25.430
you're setting a goal for your team. How would you set that goal?

386
00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:29.120
And it's again, like, how do you put structure in place to, in order to like,

387
00:20:29.121 --> 00:20:32.060
answer that question? Cause you could have ton of different goals, right?

388
00:20:32.061 --> 00:20:34.670
Like if you're just a new product, like you might say,

389
00:20:34.671 --> 00:20:37.970
it's all about user growth. If it's a more engaged, if it's more mature project,

390
00:20:37.971 --> 00:20:40.290
it's all about like deepening engagement. Um,

391
00:20:40.291 --> 00:20:42.320
and so there's like very different ways you can take it,

392
00:20:42.321 --> 00:20:45.650
but it's all about putting a structure in place to say what the goal is nice.

393
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:46.760
Um, or what successes.

394
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.750
And then there's the other side of the other interviews that are outside of the

395
00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.510
structured ones around like, okay, maybe you're getting hired for,

396
00:20:52.511 --> 00:20:56.980
to be the first PM on a team or hire to a specific role at that point.

397
00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:57.341
It's like,

398
00:20:57.341 --> 00:21:00.700
it's a couple of things like how well you can still do break down ambiguous

399
00:21:00.701 --> 00:21:03.610
problems, like potentially high while you can deal with data,

400
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.540
but also like doozies people want to work with you and do you have the right

401
00:21:07.541 --> 00:21:10.480
experience to be like, to add value to their team?

402
00:21:10.481 --> 00:21:13.330
And so it's a little bit more fundable if say like, okay,

403
00:21:13.331 --> 00:21:15.040
maybe he's a little weaker on these places,

404
00:21:15.041 --> 00:21:17.950
but like we would think we would work really well with him or we think his

405
00:21:17.951 --> 00:21:20.830
perspective is really good. And so it just depends, I guess,

406
00:21:20.831 --> 00:21:22.300
company to company enrolled role.

407
00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:26.790
<v 1>Hmm. How important is domain expertise usually for experienced PMs?</v>

408
00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:29.970
<v 0>I think it depends on the company, like a company, like a big company.</v>

409
00:21:29.971 --> 00:21:33.090
You can kind of find any role. And so it's a little bit more generalized,

410
00:21:33.091 --> 00:21:37.440
but for like a team that has one head count for 1:00 PM

411
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:39.420
at, for the rest of the year, it's like,

412
00:21:39.421 --> 00:21:42.420
it's how do you make the right decision? And having domain expertise really,

413
00:21:42.421 --> 00:21:46.710
really does help or really strong product Jewish and around like that specific

414
00:21:46.711 --> 00:21:48.630
space. Um, so it definitely does help.

415
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.640
<v 1>Do you think you might get pigeonholed though,</v>

416
00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:53.850
if it's always about domain expertise. Yeah.

417
00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.670
<v 0>Yeah. And you see that a lot. You see like some people who work in enterprise,</v>

418
00:21:56.671 --> 00:21:59.790
right? Like they stuck on, they don't, they're not stuck,

419
00:21:59.791 --> 00:22:03.690
but they built the expertise around like building developer platforms and that's

420
00:22:03.691 --> 00:22:05.490
just what they keep doing. Um,

421
00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.770
but I think it is easy to escape and try something different.

422
00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:11.490
And I think it's just sometimes easier to keep working in a role they worked in.

423
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.290
Cause you know, they understand the problem. Really.

424
00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:18.660
<v 1>Do you think you want to escape your domain or do you think you want to continue</v>

425
00:22:18.661 --> 00:22:19.870
in that domain? Whatever.

426
00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.350
<v 0>I actually don't know. I think it depends.</v>

427
00:22:22.351 --> 00:22:25.170
I think I work in media and I think media is super interesting.

428
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.520
It's also really challenging.

429
00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.060
I think having from enterprise it's like it's a little bit more cut and dry in

430
00:22:30.061 --> 00:22:34.130
terms of the things that you like and the things that you should build. Um,

431
00:22:34.131 --> 00:22:37.320
and so it's just, it depends on like what type of environment you want.

432
00:22:37.321 --> 00:22:39.810
I think in consumer it's a lot about like lock as well.

433
00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:42.930
Cause it's hard to understand what people want. Um,

434
00:22:42.931 --> 00:22:45.900
and so it's challenging if you're, you know, you have to just be patient.
