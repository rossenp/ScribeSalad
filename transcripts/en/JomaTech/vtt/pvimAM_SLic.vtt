00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.960
<v 0>So I bought a new drawing tablets because I've been falling all these Instagram</v>

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.040
artists and I thought it would make me a better drawer.

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.050
Well, apparently it didn't, unfortunately it's too late to return it.

4
00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:16.320
So I might as well just use it to teach interview questions,

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.360
which is why I'm here. So what do my favorite interview questions?

6
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.430
Uh, I'm I'm kind of curious if you can solve it so ready. Okay.

7
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.310
You have a function called random that generates a number from

8
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.820
zero to one randomly, and it's uniformly distributed.

9
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.370
Now calculate the number PI. Now I really like this question because it,

10
00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:45.600
it sounds so absurd in the beginning, right? It's almost as if, as, um,

11
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.320
it's almost similar to this question. Uh, Zoe has four apples.

12
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.810
Zoe gives one Apple to Tom,

13
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.350
and then she gives to Apple to Gary.

14
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.750
Now calculate the mass of the sun. Anyways, you can try to solve it, but, uh,

15
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.320
let's go to the drawing board. Oh. Sorry.

16
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.730
I think that's a wrong window. Um, it's it really nice looking Patrick though.

17
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.170
I wonder who drew it?

18
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.500
So the basic idea is to randomly drop points from a one to

19
00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:21.240
one square or like a one-to-one grid since you can call the random function

20
00:01:21.241 --> 00:01:21.900
twice.

21
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.040
And then what happens is that you get two numbers and then you'll use them one

22
00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:29.280
for the x-axis and one for the y-axis. So for example,

23
00:01:29.281 --> 00:01:33.330
if X becomes a 0.2 and Y becomes 0.6,

24
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.840
then where are you going to get is like maybe a point somewhere like here,

25
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.240
right? So why don't we draw a few more of these

26
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.020
now I'm going to give you a hint.

27
00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:49.320
So I'm going to draw something and I think you will know how to do it now.

28
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.980
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

29
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.090
<v 0>So, as you can see,</v>

30
00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:09.320
the goal here is to count all the points in the circle and count all the points

31
00:02:09.321 --> 00:02:10.160
in the square.

32
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.780
The ratio between these two numbers will be pretty close to the ratio between

33
00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:18.860
the total area of this circle and the total area of this square.

34
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.090
So how do you know if the point is in the circle or not? Well,

35
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.170
it's pretty simple.

36
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.700
You just take the distance between the point to the origin and if it's smaller

37
00:02:28.701 --> 00:02:33.050
than one, then it's in the circle. For example, let's take this one. All right.

38
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.500
So that line, what is the distance? Well,

39
00:02:36.501 --> 00:02:41.030
the distance it's basically X squared plus Y squared square root of that, right?

40
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.180
And then if that is smaller than one, then it's in the circle.

41
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.420
If it's bigger than one, then it's outside the circle,

42
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.860
but still inside the square. And then now it's just basic algebra, right?

43
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.540
So we all know that the area of a circle is PI R

44
00:02:56.541 --> 00:02:59.440
squared, Oh, you know,

45
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.540
idiot. And then in this case,

46
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.280
the area of a square would be two times R and then

47
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:10.540
you square that.

48
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.520
And then with this ratio is going to be the same as the ratio

49
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.790
of the number of points in the circle.

50
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:23.500
So numb point circle divided

51
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:27.730
by the number of Toto points. So Toto.

52
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.750
So then now what we want to do is we just want to isolate PI.

53
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.590
So that's pretty easy because we know that R equals one here.

54
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.360
So this can be gone. This becomes two, two to two becomes four.

55
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.730
And then we just put the four to the other side.

56
00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:47.650
So now it becomes PI equals four times the number of points in the

57
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:52.510
circle divided by the number of points total. Right. I don't want to write it.

58
00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:57.130
So I'm just going to draw these booby looking things are these it's

59
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.000
color-coded so that's nice. And then if you want a good example,

60
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:02.740
so we could actually count them. Okay.

61
00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:05.470
How many points do we have when we revise? I don't know, maybe eight,

62
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.740
eight points here. And then how many points do we have total?

63
00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:11.800
Like maybe two more points here. Obviously I'm not counting,

64
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:14.380
but let's just say it's eight divided by 10.

65
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.790
So we get eight divided by 10 times four, I guess that's pie. Right.

66
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.270
And then, yeah. So that's pretty much it, uh, yeah,

67
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.230
coding should be pretty easy. So I'm not going to go over it actually, actually,

68
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.380
actually, actually I changed my mind. Um,

69
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.800
I think I am going to show you the code for it and, uh, yeah,

70
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.280
because I feel like I could explain it a little bit better while calling,

71
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:38.740
so let's do that. Okay.

72
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.620
All right. Cool. So we got our online rep here right now and uh, yeah,

73
00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:49.150
let's just start coding it. So what we want to do is call it estimate PI,

74
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.990
and then I'm going to give it an N N meaning how many points do I actually want

75
00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:56.980
to put in? So the more points, the more accurate, right. Okay, cool.

76
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.940
So then first I want to know how many points are in the circle.

77
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.860
We'll initialize to that to zero,

78
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.870
and then also how many points or in to Toto, meaning into square.

79
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.340
So then next,

80
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.870
what we have to do is just keep looping and keep adding these points.

81
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.980
So this means we're just looping and times. Um,

82
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.700
okay. Uh, let's see, is it, is it, this is it retinal,

83
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.410
but that's not it right? Hmm. Okay.

84
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:30.940
Let me check something. Okay.

85
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.730
Excellent. Okay. Uh,

86
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.360
Python random.

87
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.630
Okay, cool. Random uniform. God got it. All right.

88
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.510
So first I want to give my ex a number uniform from zero to

89
00:05:59.511 --> 00:06:01.640
one same thing with my Y.

90
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.010
<v 1>Zero.</v>

91
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.490
<v 0>To one, and then we want to calculate the distance.</v>

92
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:11.930
So the distance what's X squared plus Y squared.

93
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.780
<v 1>And then.</v>

94
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.160
<v 0>Yeah, we're just going to keep it at that.</v>

95
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.970
We don't need two square root because what we care about is if the distance it's

96
00:06:19.971 --> 00:06:23.010
smaller than one. So if you square root something, that's smaller than one,

97
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.080
one's going to be smaller than one.

98
00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:25.670
If you square up something that's bigger than one,

99
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.680
it's going to be bigger than one. So who cares? All right. Circle.

100
00:06:30.681 --> 00:06:34.610
So then if it is inside, like if it's smaller dent one,

101
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.450
then that means it's inside circle. So we add one and then no matter what,

102
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.170
we're just going to add it to the point to the total. Got it.

103
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.810
And in Indiana, I think that's pretty much it.

104
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.860
I remember when we did our algebra, we did the formula we saw what pie was.

105
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.720
So there you go. You just returned PI.

106
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.610
And in PI we remembered that it's four times the number of points

107
00:06:55.611 --> 00:07:00.170
in the circle divided by the number of points in total.

108
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.330
Okay. Let's try this out.

109
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.090
<v 1>Excellent.</v>

110
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.730
<v 0>All right. Um, estimate PI,</v>

111
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.650
imagine if I just want 10 points in there. Uh. All right.

112
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.450
Random. Okay. Let's try this again.

113
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.900
Estimate PI. Excellent.

114
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.200
So 3.6, pretty close. I guess the more, uh,

115
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.410
points we put into our graph,

116
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.630
the more accurate it becomes that is not more accurate. Okay. Maybe a thousand.

117
00:07:35.631 --> 00:07:40.100
Okay. There we go. 3.17 PI is actually 3.14,

118
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.910
so, okay. Oh, okay. Yeah, a little bit more accurate that,

119
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:48.350
let me check with PI is actually 3.1415. Okay.

120
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.670
Maybe a hundred thousand. Okay. Getting closer to 3.14.

121
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.990
And remember this is random.

122
00:07:53.991 --> 00:07:57.110
So each time you press it or start each time you call it,

123
00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.330
it's going to give you something different. So.

124
00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:00.483
<v 1>Okay.</v>

125
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:14.710
<v 0>[Inaudible] okay. Yeah. So let's try another one. Let's just add another zero.</v>

126
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:20.170
Okay, cool. Yeah. Almost 3.1415.

127
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.440
It's probably not going to get that accurate. Let's just add one more zero.

128
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:27.880
I mean, it's not my computer anyway, so I'm not paying for the compute cost.

129
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:33.970
<v 1>It is quite long.</v>

130
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:41.620
<v 0>Okay. Oh, wow. 3.1415, actually. That's pretty accurate. Yeah.</v>

131
00:08:41.621 --> 00:08:45.970
So there you go. That's what, uh, that's what it is and that's how you do it.

132
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.080
So, yeah. All right. Cool. And, uh, I hope that was helpful.

133
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:54.760
And back to the video, uh, yeah, coding is, should be pretty easy.

134
00:08:54.761 --> 00:08:56.460
So I'm not going to go over it, uh,

135
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.100
of attaching to the description if you want to know. But yeah.

136
00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:03.150
I feel like these tutorials check out quarter pro and also check out my new

137
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:07.110
educational channel, Joe macadamia. That's pretty much it. Peace.

138
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:17.150
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>
