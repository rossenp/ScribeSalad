00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.230
<v 0>Let's look at all the offers that I've ever had in my life.</v>

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.130
We'll just go through the offers in tech because, um,

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.310
you guys probably don't care about the fact that I worked at McDonald's,

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.960
even though that MacDonald was a pretty

5
00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:18.570
fine job, I don't want to brag,

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.100
but I was a top performing employee. Actually. That's not true.

7
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:25.950
I was the worst. And, uh, why? Because I didn't care.

8
00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:27.750
I didn't really care about my job. I mean, McDonald's,

9
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:29.850
that's like a low tier company, you know,

10
00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:32.070
a high chair company would be like in and out,

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.620
but I didn't get an offer from them. So,

12
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.481
You know,

13
00:00:38.481 --> 00:00:42.140
it's the reason why I like wearing hats so much because it reminds me of the

14
00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:45.920
good old times, the humble beginnings of Joel Matech.

15
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.900
Now let's go through the tech offers.

16
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.250
Now I want to explain that I went to university of Waterloo,

17
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.320
the best school in Canada. It's basically like MIT,

18
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.750
but for Canada in Waterloo,

19
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.430
we usually have to do five to six internships. One semester you at school,

20
00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:06.860
one semester you do an internship. One semester, you at school,

21
00:01:06.861 --> 00:01:09.410
one semester you had internship blah-blah-blah.

22
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.240
So the system in which we apply to jobs is called job mine apparently announced

23
00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:17.810
called Waterloo works or something like that. But so in job mine,

24
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.680
they record all of your job application. Actually.

25
00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:24.890
They only remember all of the ones that you had an interview for.

26
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.160
And then you could either have three things either. You're not ranked.

27
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.040
It means the company does not want you at all.

28
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.370
Or you are ranked because some companies,

29
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.380
they only hire maybe one intern for the season.

30
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.960
And then because they only hire one intern.

31
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.190
What they do is that they rank the interviewees. Okay.

32
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.570
So this is my first co-op job. I think I was in,

33
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.660
I was a freshmen, right? Uh, right after freshmen.

34
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.470
Usually your first co-op term, your first internship, it's pretty bad.

35
00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.330
It's pretty bad. Um,

36
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.990
everyone in Canada or in Waterloo wants to go to Cali.

37
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.330
We have something called Kelly or bust.

38
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.650
It means you either go to California to get a job, or you bust,

39
00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:12.260
meaning you just get nothing, which is kind of a risky move.

40
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.710
It means you just apply to all California jobs because that's, you know,

41
00:02:15.711 --> 00:02:19.160
Silicon Valley. And then if you don't get any job, you're pretty.

42
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.040
All right. So let's check it out.

43
00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:26.450
So this was my first ever co-op and here you go.

44
00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:30.230
I had one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.

45
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.740
I had 11 interviews, uh, note that I,

46
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.800
I applied to 50 jobs because 50 was the maximum.

47
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.450
So I applied to 50 jobs and then I had one, two, three, four, five,

48
00:02:41.451 --> 00:02:44.870
six, six ranked, or offer one, two, three, four.

49
00:02:44.871 --> 00:02:47.300
I had four offer and two ranked.

50
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.630
Now let's look at the unranked one real quick.

51
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.850
Look at this Palentier.

52
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.610
I got Palentier interview for my first term,

53
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.830
which is crazy. Now. Usually they only hire seniors,

54
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.410
which is true because they didn't hire me. But then again,

55
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.220
I was extremely unqualified for it. You know, I just started coding.

56
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:11.350
I didn't know anything about software engineering,

57
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.220
but I got pretty far because I think what I did was, um,

58
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.810
they came to, to our school to talk about Palentier and stuff like that.

59
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.840
And then I started talking or chatting with one of the person.

60
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:26.200
He was a Ford deployed engineer. And apparently he was from Montreal too.

61
00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:28.540
I was like, Oh, I'm from Montreal too. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

62
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.080
And then we bonded over that. And then he was able to get me an interview,

63
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.640
which is very rare, but yeah.

64
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.240
And then I passed the phone interview and they were quite impressed.

65
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.030
But then once I got to the onsite, it's not really an onsite.

66
00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:42.250
They actually come to Waterloo to do the interview.

67
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.450
They asked me a systems question, I'll say, yeah, there's no way.

68
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:49.600
I know anything. Like, I didn't know anything about computers back then.

69
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.330
I didn't know anything about software engineering. So yeah.

70
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.790
I felt it easy peasy. Yeah.

71
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.900
So like the first jobs you usually get like QA positions or, you know,

72
00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.860
positions.

73
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.450
And that that's exactly what I got as you see QA for bank of America.

74
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.980
And then I did not get quantitative research while that must be a really

75
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.910
hardcore job. Quantitative research macro Montreal, didn't get that.

76
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.900
Does art you learn, Oh,

77
00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:18.850
that's actually a good first company to be at in Waterloo, but didn't get that.

78
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.660
Oh, but I got the QA version, the QA developer for it.

79
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.730
But I did not take that in the end. I took Scotiabank because,

80
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.150
uh, as analyst credit and equity derivatives,

81
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.610
that's actually a financial engineering position.

82
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.960
So I've had friends that went there and it's a pretty legit job.

83
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.680
My friends were seniors or juniors and they had this job.

84
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.300
So to get it as a freshmen, I was pretty proud.

85
00:04:46.301 --> 00:04:47.710
So I took that job.

86
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.310
And then if we go to the second year as a sophomore,

87
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.430
as you can see, I got one, two, three, three offers, one ranked and then one,

88
00:04:57.431 --> 00:05:00.910
two, three, four, five, five rejection out of all of these interviews.

89
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.800
So this one, I was actually pretty happy. I worked pretty hard for it.

90
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.760
And fortunately, I got a lot of these finance slash tech jobs.

91
00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:13.660
So as you can see, I was still in finance. I got an offer from Bloomberg.

92
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.730
That was like the first offer I got.

93
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.620
And I was quite happy because Bloomberg for second co-op is pretty

94
00:05:20.621 --> 00:05:25.450
legit. I think, because I want to go to America. I even told my advisor.

95
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.330
I said, I want to go to America.

96
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.410
But then my advisor told me, no, you shouldn't do that. That's,

97
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.600
that's a stupid decision to make. You're not going to get it. Honestly,

98
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.930
that guy. If I listened to him, I probably wouldn't have been, you know,

99
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.760
working at these nice companies nowadays. But yeah, he literally said,

100
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.670
don't even think about it. That is so disrespectful.

101
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.300
So what I did was I applied to only American jobs.

102
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.220
So it's kind of like Cali or bus, but instead it's America or bust.

103
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.440
And look at that, I got three offers from us.

104
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.550
Oh actually,

105
00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:08.480
actually it's more than just three offer actually got quantitative brokers too.

106
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.530
But the thing about employers is sometimes they call you, they say, Oh,

107
00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:15.080
do you want this offer? If not, then I'm not going to,

108
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.130
I'm not going to rank you.

109
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:19.340
I'm not going to offer you because it's kind of like a game theory thing or a

110
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:21.020
matching problem. But, you know,

111
00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:25.310
I got cooler job offers like Citadel investment. That was a big deal.

112
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.420
I actually have a video that talks about, um, Citadel. So yeah. Check,

113
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.270
check that out if you want. Oh yeah. By the way,

114
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.410
at this point I started knowing how to crack the interview. I mean,

115
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.100
I'm not going to talk about how exactly like what I did to get the offers

116
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:42.230
because I already made videos of that. And I'll also,

117
00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:45.920
I have a whole course on it called tech interview pro.com, uh,

118
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.390
which is really good. Uh, I mean,

119
00:06:47.391 --> 00:06:52.100
you should check it out now because there's a 50% off currently for labor day

120
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:54.920
week. Um, it's,

121
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.130
it's pretty much a video course that teaches you exactly how to ACE an

122
00:06:58.131 --> 00:06:58.880
interview.

123
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.410
And there's like a private Facebook group where we answer questions and there's

124
00:07:03.411 --> 00:07:06.860
like live Q and a where we host like every two weeks. So yeah,

125
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:11.090
definitely check it out. If you're preparing to interview, it's really good.

126
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.880
I'm super proud of this course. And uh, yeah. Cool.

127
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.450
I hope that you guys would enjoy it too, but yeah. Check it out.

128
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.250
This is my third co-op and now I, you know, I got the hang of it, but uh,

129
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:27.140
I want it to go into pure software companies, right? Like LinkedIn, Facebook,

130
00:07:27.141 --> 00:07:30.530
Google, those kinds of things. So I didn't want to do finance tech anymore.

131
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.700
So now this time I applied to my dream companies.

132
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.890
So as you can see the offers, I got, I got Coursera. Coursera was good.

133
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:44.420
I, I liked the interview. The interview was pretty good. Uh, as you can see, I,

134
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.120
uh, I got rejected by Google. You know,

135
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:52.220
my dream company got rejected and then LinkedIn, I got an offer there,

136
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:57.080
which was great. I made a video about it on how I got an internship at LinkedIn.

137
00:07:57.081 --> 00:08:00.710
You could, should check that out. And then Microsoft for embedded systems,

138
00:08:00.711 --> 00:08:04.550
I did not get it, but I got the software development, engineering role.

139
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.940
That makes sense. I didn't know anything about embedded systems.

140
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:11.990
I had no idea how I got the interview. I thought I did decently well, but,

141
00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:17.240
but yeah, probably not. Cause cause they rejected me once again,

142
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:21.640
applied to Palentier technologies, but I didn't get it this time. I was right.

143
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:25.040
Yeah. She asked me the same question, but I still failed.

144
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:28.910
And then Tinder, yo,

145
00:08:28.911 --> 00:08:33.860
this was the first time they were hiring interns from Waterloo and I got the

146
00:08:33.861 --> 00:08:38.720
offer. They only picked one. I remember because, um, I did the interview.

147
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.930
I even talked to the CTO. Wait, what happened? Oh yeah.

148
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:47.180
Remember like I had a porn Dora. Yeah. So I made porn Dora,

149
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:52.070
but um, I like, I, I didn't list it here exactly on my resume.

150
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.860
Cause we did I LinkedIn corporate actually. Yeah, I did. I did.

151
00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.180
I think I did put in my porn Dora, um,

152
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.770
project,

153
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:06.570
but I called it like video streaming site or something like that.

154
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.430
But yeah, because I did that project, I learned a lot about AWS, you know?

155
00:09:11.431 --> 00:09:14.880
So anything with like auto-scaling stuff, you know,

156
00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:19.530
using S3 CDNs and stuff like that because it was very like video intensive kind

157
00:09:19.531 --> 00:09:20.130
of things.

158
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:25.050
So I think I really impressed the CTO because I knew a lot of these scrappy

159
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.100
technologies that you usually use when you build a project from scratch.

160
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:33.420
So I, uh, yeah, I think the CTO liked me, so that was great.

161
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:36.450
And then also the recruiter was super cute, but.

162
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.673
<v 2>Um.</v>

163
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:42.960
<v 0>Yeah. I don't know if she imagined she watches my videos. That'd be great.</v>

164
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.420
<v 2>Uh, should I message her nostril.</v>

165
00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:53.060
<v 0>Anyways? And then I also got the Yelp offer. That was pretty cool. Yext.</v>

166
00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.890
I have no idea what Yext is.

167
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:59.330
So that's pretty much it for the co-op because after that I actually dropped out

168
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.180
of co-op. The reason is because I didn't want to do PD,

169
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:03.740
which is the professional development.

170
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.520
You had to write an essay about the work that you've done or something like

171
00:10:07.521 --> 00:10:09.680
that. And I really, really didn't want to do it.

172
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.690
So I just dropped out of the whole co-op system and I just found jobs myself.

173
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.990
I went to Facebook and then after that I went to Microsoft,

174
00:10:17.991 --> 00:10:21.860
I went to Facebook for data science and Microsoft for uh, product management,

175
00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:26.990
program management. And um, yeah, I just got a referral didn't interview and,

176
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:28.490
you know, got the offer.

177
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.060
I didn't really take the chance to interview a bunch of places,

178
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.680
which I do regret for full time when I got out of, um,

179
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.550
school. I think I applied to a lot of different companies too.

180
00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.120
I got rejected from Palentier again. Uh, yeah.

181
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:45.800
I was just never able to go to Palentier.

182
00:10:45.801 --> 00:10:49.130
I got rejected by Facebook RPM for product management.

183
00:10:49.131 --> 00:10:52.640
I got rejected by Google APM. Uh, so it's a program, uh,

184
00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:57.080
associate product manager. Yeah. So, uh, that's pretty much it.

185
00:10:57.081 --> 00:10:59.960
And then the offers I got was like Buzzfeed for data science,

186
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:03.470
cause I want to get famous. And then I went there. Um,

187
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.460
I already had a return offer for Facebook. I had a return offer from Microsoft.

188
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:12.110
I ended up going to, um, what's it called again? Yeah. Buzzfeed.

189
00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.060
And then, I mean,

190
00:11:14.061 --> 00:11:18.680
I did get a few offers for my recent switch from data science to

191
00:11:18.681 --> 00:11:22.820
software. So the offers that I got were, Oh,

192
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.560
sorry about that. The camera,

193
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:28.130
the camera was doing something where I guess it got cut off. Yeah.

194
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.230
<v 2>Anyways. So.</v>

195
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.500
<v 0>That's about it. Um, now to the quick updates,</v>

196
00:11:33.501 --> 00:11:38.420
I just want to thank each and every one of you who donate it to the fundraiser,

197
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:43.040
to my fundraiser for mental health America. And uh, yeah, in case you forgot,

198
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:48.230
uh, I was giving out these corgis for everyone who donated and we

199
00:11:48.231 --> 00:11:52.800
passed our goal. The goal was $2,000 and we passed it and uh,

200
00:11:52.801 --> 00:11:54.970
I still have a lot of corgis left,

201
00:11:54.971 --> 00:11:59.200
so I'm just gonna increase the goal to $3,000 now. But uh, yeah,

202
00:11:59.201 --> 00:12:01.900
I'm super happy about it. The turnout was super great.

203
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.000
And you guys are doing this for a great cause.

204
00:12:04.001 --> 00:12:08.560
So thank you so much for donating. So I rarely talk about my personal life, but

205
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.850
um, I guess I'll tell you this. I actually have a roommate. Uh,

206
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.510
she is a high school teacher teaching environmental science.

207
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.840
I have massive respect for her. She's doing something great.

208
00:12:19.841 --> 00:12:23.650
She's teaching something very important and she teaches me all the time too.

209
00:12:23.651 --> 00:12:28.300
I'm basically a man-child and she helps me become less of a

210
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.990
man-child. So I really, really appreciate her today.

211
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:36.790
I wanted to surprise her by giving her a new Mac book

212
00:12:36.791 --> 00:12:41.170
pro provided by brilliant.org. Thank you so much for sending that. So thanks.

213
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:46.840
brilliant.org for sponsoring this video and sending this MacBook pro for her and

214
00:12:46.841 --> 00:12:48.820
a brilliant.org in case you don't know,

215
00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:53.290
it is a website that publishes daily challenge everyday on STEM.

216
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.340
The site is extremely sleek and they have over 50 interactive courses,

217
00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.460
which makes learning these concepts so much easier.

218
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.270
I actually use them when I prep for my data science interviews,

219
00:13:04.271 --> 00:13:07.390
because their probability section was really, really good.

220
00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:11.980
This website is a great compliment to universities because you get to

221
00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:16.090
practice all these things that you've learned in theory in class.

222
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:19.930
And then you can finally apply it to these questions. For example, me myself,

223
00:13:19.931 --> 00:13:24.310
I'm more of a doer than a listener. I have to try after practice.

224
00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:29.140
I have to do things and I wish that I had brilliant.org when I was in school

225
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.390
because I would be able to practice my questions.

226
00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:35.710
I would able to apply my knowledge to see if I actually understand.

227
00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:40.090
So if you're interested, don't forget to go on brilliant.org/joma.

228
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:44.230
And the first 200 people will get 20% off, all right.

229
00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:49.630
Back to my roommate. So I asked her to talk about, um, water bottle usages.

230
00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:54.670
And, um, I, there was basically an excuse to film it, to film her reaction.

231
00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.490
But I mean, the thing that she says is really important.

232
00:13:57.491 --> 00:14:01.360
So you should listen to it, but this is what happened for the short break.

233
00:14:01.361 --> 00:14:04.540
I want to talk to you about something quite important and it's about water

234
00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:04.810
balls.

235
00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:08.470
Now I have my roommate here and she's going to be talking about something really

236
00:14:08.471 --> 00:14:09.304
important.

237
00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:14.220
<v 3>So I'm about water bottles, right? Okay. So, well,</v>

238
00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:17.070
chances are you drank out of water bottles, um, you know,

239
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.410
some time in your life and more likely than not,

240
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:22.800
it's probably a plastic water bottle. Um,

241
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:26.460
and unfortunately that's probably not the best thing to do for our environment,

242
00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.640
of course, because we all live on this planet and we share it.

243
00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.130
And plastic is made out of oil,

244
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:37.020
which is a fossil field that unfortunately we don't have very

245
00:14:37.021 --> 00:14:40.410
much of left in our world and we, you know,

246
00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:44.670
don't want to run out of it and we have a lot of other applications for it.

247
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.340
Okay. So plastic water bottles, you know,

248
00:14:47.341 --> 00:14:50.100
it doesn't always end up where you think it might when you're done using it.

249
00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.190
So what is easy trick.

250
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.050
<v 0>To prevent this issue?</v>

251
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.290
<v 3>Um, it probably be a good idea to get a reusable water bottle. Oh.</v>

252
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:00.400
Nice.

253
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:05.320
<v 0>So it's really important, which is why I have my own water bottle.</v>

254
00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:09.400
So as you can see using, we use of a water bottle is very, very important.

255
00:15:09.401 --> 00:15:12.040
That's why I always use a reusable water bottle.

256
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:23.200
<v 3>Wait, this was plastic bottle. Oh yeah. That's dumb.</v>

257
00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.100
I didn't, it didn't realize that.

258
00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.150
<v 0>Thank you for doing this video. So I have a little surprise for you.</v>

259
00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:35.200
Close your eyes. It's a little gift for you.

260
00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.730
<v 3>All right. You can open your eyes. This is yours.</v>

261
00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:41.980
This is sponsored by.

262
00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:45.460
<v 0>Thank you so much for providing this MacBook pro,</v>

263
00:15:45.461 --> 00:15:49.630
which I give to my roommate because she's a great teacher.

264
00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:55.110
It's yours. It's not,

265
00:15:55.111 --> 00:15:57.880
it's not just for, I was hoping for a better one.

266
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:02.800
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

267
00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.950
<v 0>Yeah, this is a, this is yours for all your hard work. Why?</v>

268
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:10.180
All the good con I'm really confused right now. I mean, brilliant Santos.

269
00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:14.650
A laptop. So since I have already three of them, I don't need them.

270
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:19.330
I don't know what to do.

271
00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.433
<v 3>That's okay.</v>

272
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.230
<v 0>Okay. Here's how you're supposed to react.</v>

273
00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:36.450
<v 3>No way. No, no, no, no. I can't accept no way.</v>

274
00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:42.393
Oh my God.

275
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:46.600
<v 0>That's what you, that's what you were supposed to do. So let's do that again.</v>
