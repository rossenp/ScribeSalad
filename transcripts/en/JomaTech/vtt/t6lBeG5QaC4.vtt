1
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:07.130
<v 0>Well.</v>

2
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.300
<v 1>Welcome to the Jomo show,</v>

3
00:00:08.301 --> 00:00:12.620
the show where we give you tips and tricks on how to land a successful career in

4
00:00:12.621 --> 00:00:17.480
tech. Now, today we have a special guests. Well, Yuko, how are you doing?

5
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.590
So I guess first thing's first happy Halloween. Happy Halloween.

6
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.240
Do you have any, uh, costume?

7
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.330
<v 2>Ah, I'm still working on mine right now. Um,</v>

8
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.410
but I am going to show on Tuesday on Halloween night. Uh,

9
00:00:30.411 --> 00:00:31.820
so I'm pretty excited for that.

10
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
<v 1>Awesome. Yeah. Yeah. I'm thinking of just bringing this to the office,</v>

11
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.560
showing everyone and stuff like that, but yeah. Cool. I guess, uh,

12
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.810
I'll start with some short questions. Cool. Just to see, you know,

13
00:00:41.811 --> 00:00:45.800
if we can be friends, so there's no right answer. Okay.

14
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.260
But there's a right answer if you want to be my friend. Okay.

15
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.150
Hopefully I answered them. Right. Mac or PC Mac though, though. Okay. All right.

16
00:00:53.151 --> 00:00:55.100
Good answer. iPhone or Android?

17
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.150
<v 0>IPhone. Okay.</v>

18
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.580
<v 1>Favorite programming language.</v>

19
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.140
<v 0>Swift.</v>

20
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.780
<v 1>Okay. That's okay. Cause you're an iOS developer and uh, okay.</v>

21
00:01:08.781 --> 00:01:10.640
I guess what about favorite editor.

22
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.750
<v 2>For your editor? You know, I have a love and hate relationship with this one,</v>

23
00:01:14.751 --> 00:01:15.380
but it has to be.

24
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.970
<v 1>X code. That makes sense. Yeah.</v>

25
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.960
Can you code it like not on X code iOS.

26
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.180
It must be a lot harder. It is. Cause I'm all about the VIM. Yeah. Race.

27
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.740
You can code.

28
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.690
<v 2>On them, but then you don't get all.</v>

29
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.130
<v 1>The LinkedIn. Yeah, that's true. I think that's why I'm not a iOS engineer.</v>

30
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.640
I can never do that. Okay. What about this coffee or tea?

31
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.570
<v 0>Hm, I'm going say T T yeah.</v>

32
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.800
<v 1>Nice. That's good. I actually don't drink either. That wasn't even a question.</v>

33
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.000
I like Hintwater. Do you know what this, do you guys have this? No,

34
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:52.310
we don't have that sponsored by Hintwater.

35
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.390
<v 2>Every other tech company and that we have a ton of LaCroix. What is that?</v>

36
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.630
The court it's like the it's like flavored sparkling water is in the little

37
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.033
cans.

38
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.920
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. Those are right. They're kind of like hint, but you know, fizzle,</v>

39
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.870
I guess. Yeah. Cool. Cool. Cool.

40
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.040
So you are an iOS engineer at Patrion. Okay, cool. Cool.

41
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.130
<v 2>Yeah. Um, so yeah, I'm a, I was an engineer at Patrion.</v>

42
00:02:13.131 --> 00:02:17.570
I've been doing iOS development for about three ish years now. Um,

43
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.260
and I haven't done any other like types of mobile programming, but yeah.

44
00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:24.770
I used to work at Intuit and I worked on the TurboTax and QuickBooks apps and

45
00:02:24.771 --> 00:02:29.270
now I work at Patrion. I've been there for about a year and a half now. Um,

46
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.100
but yeah, it's really fun. I like it a lot. Cool.

47
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.180
<v 1>Wait, so in Intuit, where you an iOS engineer also. Okay.</v>

48
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.690
What about the four done before then? I was in school.

49
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.850
And did you do any iOS programming things?

50
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.320
<v 2>I took one class called mobile programming where we made an iOS app,</v>

51
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.440
but actually even before that there was a software engineering course that I

52
00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:49.850
took where we made an Android app.

53
00:02:49.851 --> 00:02:53.720
So I made an Android app before I made an iOS app. Uh,

54
00:02:53.721 --> 00:02:56.360
so I use like Andrew's studio and then I came to X code and I was like,

55
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.340
Escalade is so much cleaner. Don't hate me. Apple's.

56
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.970
<v 1>Great. Yeah. Um, I guess one thing I always wanted to know,</v>

57
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:07.810
like how will you even get started with Iowa scent like development?

58
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:11.680
Because I always wanted to make apps. Cause that's what that's, what's cool now.

59
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:15.640
Like nobody uses like web anymore, but like, it's just so hard.

60
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:19.120
Like the first thing I pop up is like X code and then it tells me to download

61
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:23.440
all these things. I don't know what they are. And then I dunno frames.

62
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.860
Is that something like, I have no idea how do I even get started?

63
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.980
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. So I was definitely,</v>

64
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.330
there's a lot of different things that you need to learn in order to get

65
00:03:33.331 --> 00:03:36.510
started. And so that can be really intimidating for folks. Um,

66
00:03:36.511 --> 00:03:40.050
when I first started doing iOS development in that mobile mobile programming

67
00:03:40.051 --> 00:03:41.130
class, uh,

68
00:03:41.131 --> 00:03:45.150
we opened up X code and there were so many knobs that I was just like, ah,

69
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.690
panic kit, can't do it. Um, and so when I asked her to thankfully,

70
00:03:48.691 --> 00:03:51.150
there's a TA that walked us through how to use it.

71
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.860
And so once we understood how to use X code, it obviously became a lot easier.

72
00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.030
Um, but in terms of the actual, like programming language Swift and objective C,

73
00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:02.820
which people don't typically learn in school, uh,

74
00:04:02.821 --> 00:04:04.500
as well as like all the different, you know,

75
00:04:04.501 --> 00:04:06.360
patterns and frameworks and stuff that you have to use,

76
00:04:06.361 --> 00:04:08.160
it can be really intimidating. Um,

77
00:04:08.161 --> 00:04:09.990
but thankfully there's a lot of online resources,

78
00:04:09.991 --> 00:04:11.640
like a lot of other programming languages.

79
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.170
And the two that I recommend for getting started is one actually by Apple.

80
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.490
Um, Apple is really trying to get more people to do iOS development. Okay.

81
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.760
That was part of the motivation for inventing the programming language Swift.

82
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.230
Uh, and so if you actually look up like iOS tutorial by Apple, um,

83
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.520
there is a great tutorial that teaches you how to make your first app. Uh,

84
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.960
and it shows you kind of step by step,

85
00:04:33.961 --> 00:04:38.010
like where to click and all those kinds of things, as well as what to code. Um,

86
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.450
my second most recommended, uh, like two actually I have three.

87
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.380
So when my second one is a website called Ray wonder like.com, um,

88
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.600
Ray wonder like is the person that owns this website.

89
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.280
And he has a bunch of writers that writes these tutorials and the iOS tutorials

90
00:04:53.281 --> 00:04:57.690
are super, super good. Um, they, again are step-by-step tutorials and like,

91
00:04:57.691 --> 00:05:00.660
here's what you need to code. Here's what you need to do. Uh,

92
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.810
and it has everything from like how to even get started to like,

93
00:05:03.811 --> 00:05:07.530
here's how to use this very specific framework to do a very specific thing.

94
00:05:07.531 --> 00:05:12.180
Like I don't maybe want to like use the camera to detect if it's a

95
00:05:12.181 --> 00:05:16.530
fruit or if it's a hot dog, in some cases. Yes.

96
00:05:16.531 --> 00:05:18.600
In Silicon Valley, I watch a little bit of it.

97
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.420
<v 1>Yeah. It was like Jin yang who was like a developer.</v>

98
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.630
He made an app that can detect what the food is.

99
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.840
And then he sh he does the demo. He's like, Oh, it's hot dog.

100
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.870
But then when you put it something else, it just says not hot dog.

101
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.030
And that's all I can do.

102
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.920
<v 2>Um, don't go to DC this year. Apple came out with like, uh, AR VR kit,</v>

103
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.900
I air kit and like AR kit, like the, they basically integrated into iPhone.

104
00:05:42.901 --> 00:05:44.560
Right. And so they were doing a bunch of demos there.

105
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.720
So many references to like hot dog, not hot dog. I feel like Silicon Valley,

106
00:05:48.721 --> 00:05:50.040
the show one. Yeah.

107
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.270
<v 1>But yeah, that's cool. So I guess like, you know, backend engineers,</v>

108
00:05:54.271 --> 00:05:55.920
we have like some inside jokes, you know,

109
00:05:55.921 --> 00:05:59.780
we talk about certain things like certain bugs that we encounter frequently.

110
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:02.090
Yeah. Are there any iOS things?

111
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.400
<v 2>Yeah, my favorite, yeah. My favorite ones are against X code,</v>

112
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:11.140
which is the IDE that we used to do development, but X code is like, like,

113
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.980
I think any IDE can be really finicky. And so there's two jokes,

114
00:06:14.981 --> 00:06:18.490
running jokes that I like love. And one is, um, like if, uh,

115
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.480
we say to each other like, Oh,

116
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.940
have you tried cleaning derive data and drive data?

117
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.320
It's just like this cache that the,

118
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.230
the X code uses to be able to compile faster. But if something doesn't work,

119
00:06:26.231 --> 00:06:28.060
then that's like, kind of generally the first thing that you do.

120
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.230
I think one of my top tweets is actually a meme I made out and that's my claim

121
00:06:32.231 --> 00:06:36.300
to fame on Twitter. Um, and there's actually my,

122
00:06:36.301 --> 00:06:39.970
my second favorite one against excavators. There's just like tumbler. Uh,

123
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.420
I forgot what it's called it. It must be something called like, X coats, others,

124
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.910
but it's like a text message thread between yourself and X code.

125
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.360
And so it likes throws different errors and stuff, and you're just like, wait,

126
00:06:52.361 --> 00:06:54.460
but why does it? And they're just like, it just repeats the air.

127
00:06:54.461 --> 00:06:57.160
It's just all these things that ex-co desert are just so annoying,

128
00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.070
but I love that block so much interesting.

129
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.300
<v 1>Because like your favorite editor is X code, but it's also like super annoying.</v>

130
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.240
Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's interesting. Yeah. Cool.

131
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.110
I guess I want to know more like about you. Cool. You know, like, for example,

132
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.710
I guess just tell me about your life story and then we'll go to high school and

133
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.890
then college, all this stupid dirt. I want to know.

134
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.610
<v 2>All right. We're going to be real vulnerable and real honest here. Yeah. Um,</v>

135
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.470
cool. So I was born in the East coast in Massachusetts, specifically.

136
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.690
Yeah. And, uh, I was really little when we moved back to Japan,

137
00:07:31.691 --> 00:07:35.710
my family and I, um, and we lived there for about two years. Part of Japan, uh,

138
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.150
in Kobe. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of near like Koto Osaka area,

139
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:44.170
but Kobe is known like most commonly tied to Kobe beef. Oh yeah. Kobe Bryant,

140
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.560
you know? Yeah. Um,

141
00:07:47.561 --> 00:07:51.040
so we lived there for like two years and then we moved back to the States when I

142
00:07:51.041 --> 00:07:54.430
was like three something. So I barely remember living in Japan. Right. Um,

143
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.300
but I lived on the East coast until I was about 10 living between New York and

144
00:07:58.301 --> 00:08:01.870
Connecticut. And so like my early childhood memories were like, you know,

145
00:08:01.871 --> 00:08:05.260
having snow days and like playing the leaves and all that kind of stuff. Um,

146
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.900
I was also like the only Asian kid in school for a lot of the times. So yeah.

147
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:14.290
Uh, and then when I moved, uh, I moved to San Diego, California when I was 10.

148
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:18.760
Yeah. San Diego just really, you know, dude.

149
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:23.740
Um, and yeah, I went to middle school, high school there,

150
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.410
and then I went to college at UC San Diego,

151
00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:28.510
which was only like 20 minutes away from my house,

152
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:33.790
but I went there and got my degree in computer science and then English. Cool.

153
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.150
<v 1>Well, yeah, I guess like one question. Cause, um,</v>

154
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.630
when I was a kid like an elementary school, I guess, you know,

155
00:08:40.631 --> 00:08:44.050
I like things that are more engineering type, but I just didn't know.

156
00:08:44.051 --> 00:08:44.681
For example,

157
00:08:44.681 --> 00:08:48.520
I liked building Legos or like playing this game called kingdom hearts,

158
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.840
one small part of the game where you could build a spaceship. And I loved that.

159
00:08:52.841 --> 00:08:55.290
I played it more than the actual game itself, you know,

160
00:08:55.291 --> 00:08:58.200
I just love building things. So what about you, like when you were a child,

161
00:08:58.201 --> 00:09:00.360
like, did you do anything like that? Not really.

162
00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.320
<v 2>Really. Actually. I'm trying to think back and I couldn't really like dig up,</v>

163
00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:07.940
like I wasn't someone who played with a bunch of Legos. Yeah. Um, I also wasn't,

164
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:11.630
I guess like one thing that I think was common to a lot of like girls might,

165
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.320
or like that were my age was playing Neo pets. Yeah.

166
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:19.730
<v 1>Yeah. I used to play like the stock market and the old pads.</v>

167
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:22.880
I used to trade like the marketplace, like buy and sell stuff.

168
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.730
And I trained my little Kiko. I think that was the no pet name.

169
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.840
The Kiko can look really strong. And I was like beating everyone in the stadium.

170
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:30.710
Yeah.

171
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:32.130
<v 2>Yeah. My, I always like made,</v>

172
00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:35.360
made sure like that my like new pets page or whatever it used to like make my

173
00:09:35.361 --> 00:09:37.220
page look good, which gets to that.

174
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:40.640
I think that was kind of one of my first exposures to coding. Um,

175
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:44.180
but also I was always like getting free omelets score the wheel of fortune,

176
00:09:44.181 --> 00:09:48.020
getting all the free stuff. And that was super fun.

177
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.150
But other than that, I think generally,

178
00:09:50.151 --> 00:09:52.070
like I really liked math when I was growing up.

179
00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:56.660
<v 1>Minus one that's free.</v>

180
00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:02.030
<v 2>Uh, and so like playing computer games. Yeah. I was that person, um,</v>

181
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.400
playing computer games that were like math oriented,

182
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:06.200
even if it was like an educational one.

183
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:09.763
<v 1>So, you know.</v>

184
00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.800
<v 2>School, they try to get you to play these educational games.</v>

185
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.293
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

186
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.030
<v 2>None of them was games.</v>

187
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.630
And there was one game that I loved playing that was like this like cash

188
00:10:20.631 --> 00:10:21.464
register game.

189
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.823
<v 1>You're supposed to like.</v>

190
00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.720
<v 2>Form the amount with your exact, like which coins and changes and stuff.</v>

191
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.220
And I was like, this is so cool.

192
00:10:31.221 --> 00:10:35.180
This is what I want to be dynamic programming algorithm for that

193
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.090
maybe I did, but I was just like,

194
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.010
this is what I would want to do when I grow up.

195
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:44.600
I want to like do this Mackey stuff and whatever. Like I love that game.

196
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:49.610
Not even a game. It was fun. I love that. Um, but yeah, I, I think, yeah,

197
00:10:49.611 --> 00:10:51.560
and then like, as I became a teenager,

198
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:56.430
Zynga was a big thing and also like customizing your zing a page. Yeah. Uh,

199
00:10:56.431 --> 00:10:59.030
and like, even though a lot of it was kind of like, you know,

200
00:10:59.031 --> 00:11:01.640
I didn't make a whole template for Zynga for my page,

201
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:04.490
but being able to tweak little things here and there to make it look like how I

202
00:11:04.491 --> 00:11:07.120
wanted it to, I guess it was kind of an early indicator.

203
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:09.860
<v 1>I think. Yeah. That's true. Like tweak that you have to like code a little bit,</v>

204
00:11:09.861 --> 00:11:11.600
like at least like the hex numbers for yeah.

205
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.350
<v 2>A little bit like going into CSS and making sure that like I have the right</v>

206
00:11:15.351 --> 00:11:18.470
color, um, like colors were kind of like the big thing,

207
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.440
just a lot of like UI type things and like moving,

208
00:11:21.441 --> 00:11:23.750
like maybe I don't want this here, but I want it here.

209
00:11:23.751 --> 00:11:28.130
And reading through the HTML slash XML or whatever it was written in to do that.

210
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.270
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean,</v>

211
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:33.530
since you liked math so much where you're like a nerd in school, I kind of was,

212
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:34.663
I was definitely.

213
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:37.490
<v 2>He doesn't second and third grade, you do those like multiplication tables,</v>

214
00:11:37.491 --> 00:11:39.770
like cheats that you have to finish in five minutes.

215
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.660
I was like always the first one to be done because it competitive. Yeah.

216
00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:47.330
But also like, my dad taught me my most applications tables, like earlier on.

217
00:11:47.331 --> 00:11:48.980
So I was like, Oh my parents.

218
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:54.910
<v 1>It's like a Cantonese, not a song, but they make memorize in Japanese.</v>

219
00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:59.020
So I'm actually pretty bad at multiplication when we do like contests like me

220
00:11:59.021 --> 00:12:01.690
against like a friend, because they would say it in French,

221
00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.440
I have to translate in Cantonese and then do the multiplication and then

222
00:12:05.441 --> 00:12:09.340
retranslate it it's for French. Oh my God. Yeah. It was so hard.

223
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:13.660
So then people thought it was super slow. Yeah. It was just a language barrier.

224
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:16.990
It was a language barrier. Yeah. Yeah. So what about, what about high school?

225
00:12:16.991 --> 00:12:18.340
Like who who'd you hang out with?

226
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.740
Were they like math whiz kids or like kids? Yeah. Um.

227
00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:27.450
<v 2>Well, so my school was really big. My high school had about,</v>

228
00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.910
I think my graduating class was about 700 people,

229
00:12:29.911 --> 00:12:33.480
so there thousands of kids in school. So when there's that many kids in school,

230
00:12:33.481 --> 00:12:34.750
there's a lot of like clicks. Right.

231
00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.030
So we had like the skater kids and the jocks and the cheerleaders.

232
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:42.930
<v 1>Oh, the skater. Oh yeah. But we were more like rappers and skaters.</v>

233
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.180
Oh, that was the thing for you guys.

234
00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:47.370
<v 2>I don't think there were any rappers at my school.</v>

235
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.660
<v 1>We didn't rap. They just liked rap. I would take skills.</v>

236
00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.570
That would be really impressive. Quite impressive. But yeah.

237
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:58.470
<v 2>Yeah. Um, so like, I, I was like, I'm not like a nerd nerd.</v>

238
00:12:58.471 --> 00:13:01.320
I'm not going to be in like science Olympiad or anything like that,

239
00:13:01.321 --> 00:13:06.180
but I did play tennis and I did orchestra and I was

240
00:13:06.181 --> 00:13:10.320
also like, yeah, yeah, absolutely. I played violin. Oh no.

241
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:12.900
<v 1>That's nice. Very difficult.</v>

242
00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.280
<v 2>It is. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's really, it had a lot of fun though.</v>

243
00:13:17.281 --> 00:13:20.400
And my orchestra class was always like very tight knit and really small.

244
00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.550
We went to, um, like Disneyland everywhere for festival.

245
00:13:23.551 --> 00:13:27.450
And we went to New York one year together, um, to play at Carnegie hall,

246
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.520
which was like really, really cool. Yeah.

247
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.730
That was probably my favorite year of Oregon show.

248
00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.500
We were just like super tight knit and we had a lot of fun.

249
00:13:34.501 --> 00:13:37.160
Our teacher was like really cool too. Um,

250
00:13:37.161 --> 00:13:40.800
and so I think I hung out with like the orchestra kids a lot of the time. Um,

251
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:44.190
but it was basically like orchestra kids and like speech and debate kids were

252
00:13:44.191 --> 00:13:45.900
kind of together, but really,

253
00:13:45.901 --> 00:13:49.500
it was just like a lot of Asian people at my school. Um,

254
00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:53.430
or like I was hanging out with the Asian people at my school. And so yeah,

255
00:13:53.431 --> 00:13:56.850
we tended to all be in like the AP classes, like through like the nerves.

256
00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:00.690
<v 1>Yeah. You guys were nerds. I mean, just, just like listen to yourself.</v>

257
00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:06.690
[inaudible] speech and debate. Yeah.

258
00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.930
<v 2>I, it was weird because it was kind of like in my own little bubble,</v>

259
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.270
because it was such a big school that I didn't,

260
00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.040
I didn't ever feel like I was like a nerd.

261
00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:18.270
Cause like I would never mix with like the kids who didn't take AP AP classes.

262
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:18.670
Yeah.

263
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:19.800
<v 1>Those people would call you nerd.</v>

264
00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.650
<v 2>But I didn't care about it. So I had to keep my self esteem somewhere, you know?</v>

265
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:30.720
Yeah. But yeah, I w I think I was like kind of shy kind of quiet, but also like,

266
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:35.550
you know, um, yeah, I guess I was kind of like a nerdish.

267
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.850
<v 1>Yeah. But I guess you didn't do any programming before college.</v>

268
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:40.620
<v 2>I did not know. I was like,</v>

269
00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:44.610
I thought computer science was for like geeks and like old white men.

270
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.350
<v 1>Um, yeah. Yeah. Cause.</v>

271
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:51.800
<v 2>I just like my thought of, yeah.</v>

272
00:14:51.801 --> 00:14:53.960
I didn't really think that computer science was for me,

273
00:14:53.961 --> 00:14:57.140
like the way that computer science and software engineers are depicted in the

274
00:14:57.141 --> 00:15:01.160
media is often, you know, like gamers and like yeah. Yeah.

275
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.240
And none of them looked like me. And I was also just like, I, I,

276
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.820
I think that's a little too intense for me. I'm not that into computer.

277
00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.690
<v 1>It's true. But if you're not getting better, like in media, especially,</v>

278
00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.090
definitely all like we have coders, like, you know,

279
00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.810
it was very diverse back when we got like, brogrammers now not nerdy at all.

280
00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.610
You know, you work out.

281
00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:20.620
<v 2>Although my secret about board grabbers,</v>

282
00:15:20.621 --> 00:15:23.470
I think it's just like the nerdy people trying to overcompensate a little bit.

283
00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:30.190
<v 1>We're not a nurse, not a program at all, but, uh, yeah.</v>

284
00:15:30.191 --> 00:15:33.150
I mean, I try to be, I try to work out and stuff like that, but yeah,

285
00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:35.730
I do think there's a little bit of overcompensation. Yeah.

286
00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.950
Working out and being healthy is a good thing. Exactly. Drinking soil.

287
00:15:38.951 --> 00:15:39.784
And every day.

288
00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.780
<v 2>We'll have to take care of yourself. So that's fine. That's totally cool.</v>

289
00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.980
<v 1>How the hell did you end up in computer science then if you didn't even want to</v>

290
00:15:47.981 --> 00:15:48.814
be.

291
00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.090
<v 2>Was I, I thought so when I entered college,</v>

292
00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:55.630
I thought I was going to be a chemistry major because I was like chemistry

293
00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:56.950
school. There's like equations.

294
00:15:56.951 --> 00:15:59.740
And then you do experiments to prove the equations are right. And it's like,

295
00:15:59.741 --> 00:16:03.310
Whoa. But I took my first class, which was, uh,

296
00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:07.630
like quantum mechanics and chemistry and lose like freshman year,

297
00:16:07.631 --> 00:16:11.500
fall quarter. And I was like, what the heck? Yeah. I was like,

298
00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:15.010
what does quantum mean? Or what does mechanics mean? It just,

299
00:16:15.011 --> 00:16:16.300
it was really intimidating. And I was like,

300
00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.690
I don't think I can actually do this, even if I did understand it. Right. Uh,

301
00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.600
and then I tried neuroscience that also didn't work out.

302
00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:26.020
And I was just talking to my former mates one day, um, at my dorm.

303
00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:28.660
And I was like, I don't really know what I'm going to declare next. Like,

304
00:16:28.661 --> 00:16:32.500
I'm kind of out of ideas. And he was a computer engineer,

305
00:16:32.501 --> 00:16:34.780
which was another form of computer science at my school.

306
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:39.730
And I had just taken a intro to logic class as part of the

307
00:16:39.731 --> 00:16:42.520
philosophy department. And that was kind of like,

308
00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.100
was really just like doing proofs and stuff,

309
00:16:45.101 --> 00:16:49.240
but just the logical nature of it was like made a lot of sense to me.

310
00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.890
Um, and so I told my friend about that and he was like,

311
00:16:53.891 --> 00:16:56.620
you should try computer science. Cause literally it's just like all logic.

312
00:16:56.621 --> 00:17:00.610
And I was like, Oh, there's a major, that's all logic. Uh,

313
00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:01.750
and so yeah,

314
00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:06.340
I took an intro to computer science class and that was the first intro to

315
00:17:06.341 --> 00:17:07.540
whatever class that I was like,

316
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:11.770
I kind of like this and I think I can understand a lot of it. Um,

317
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.750
and that's when it clicked it. I was just like, that's it,

318
00:17:13.751 --> 00:17:16.180
I'm doing computer science. And then it just like,

319
00:17:16.181 --> 00:17:17.800
next thing I knew it was in my second, third,

320
00:17:17.801 --> 00:17:20.380
fourth year and I was a computer science major.

321
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:23.500
<v 1>Yeah. So I guess now, like I'm curious, like what do you,</v>

322
00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:27.070
what do you do outside of work aside from YouTube saying now, you know?

323
00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:27.910
Cause yeah.

324
00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:28.990
<v 2>Yeah. Well,</v>

325
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:33.190
I would say I was going to say YouTube because it takes quite a bit of time.

326
00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:36.310
I mean, I'm happy to do it, but like, you know, it's, it's a solid hobby now.

327
00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:40.960
Right. Um, other than that I think, yeah. I like like to hang out with friends,

328
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:45.580
um, like I have a cat and a dog and so hanging out with them, um, watching,

329
00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:47.380
watching YouTube, uh,

330
00:17:47.381 --> 00:17:52.260
I don't actually have like side projects very often for coding all like start

331
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.700
I've started a couple before,

332
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:58.470
but I haven't fully like committed like two months to one.

333
00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.280
Uh, and so yeah, I'm, I'm like,

334
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:05.010
I think I'm someone who actually was actually really bad at holding hobbies.

335
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.520
I like play guitar for like a month and then I'll be like, I'm done, I'll play.

336
00:18:08.521 --> 00:18:10.980
Like, I'll go to the gym for like a month. And I'm like, okay, I'm done.

337
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.790
And then I do, it's just like, I try a bunch of stuff and then I like stopped,

338
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.690
but I used to like beat myself up over this. Cause I was like, wait,

339
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.640
we can't do anything. But now I'm just like, you know what,

340
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.880
you're an adult and you can do whatever you want. And I'm like, yeah,

341
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:25.770
I do what I want with my time.

342
00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:29.390
<v 1>Exactly. Do you want to be an iOS engineer? Like forever?</v>

343
00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:30.350
Like what's your five-year plan?

344
00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.000
<v 2>That's a good question. Um,</v>

345
00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:36.350
it's something that I've been thinking about really like a lot recently. Um,

346
00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:38.570
until like a couple months ago I was like,

347
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.230
I'm going to be an iOS engineer or at least a software engineer forever. Um,

348
00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:46.310
I didn't really see myself going into management or like being like the own

349
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:49.460
owner of a company or anything like that. Uh, but more recently I've,

350
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:52.070
I've been more open to the idea of like becoming a manager.

351
00:18:52.071 --> 00:18:54.290
So right now my five-year plan, I think looks like,

352
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:58.550
like I still really want to up my skills as a software engineer.

353
00:18:58.551 --> 00:19:01.730
I think there's still some stuff there. Um, I am like,

354
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.670
I feel like I have pretty good solid like coding skills now,

355
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.900
but in terms of like architecting a whole system or owning the delivery of a big

356
00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:12.470
thing, like those are kind of skills that I want to have more of. Um,

357
00:19:12.471 --> 00:19:16.400
so that's what I'm kind of trying to do over the next year. Uh,

358
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:20.450
and then like probably maybe considering going into some sort of management

359
00:19:20.451 --> 00:19:23.150
position maybe. Um, but at the same time,

360
00:19:23.151 --> 00:19:27.200
like if I feel that what I'm doing in terms of like owning big systems and big

361
00:19:27.201 --> 00:19:30.620
decisions at work is really fulfilling, then I might just keep doing that.

362
00:19:30.621 --> 00:19:33.740
But really I think like it's fun to be evaluating at all times,

363
00:19:33.741 --> 00:19:35.960
like what I want to do with my life. Um,

364
00:19:35.961 --> 00:19:39.230
and like YouTube has like really changed a lot of that for me. Cause I'm like,

365
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:42.020
I like to have a big impact on other people, um,

366
00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:45.380
with like what I have in my brain and what experiences that I've had.

367
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:49.580
And so like maybe YouTube is something I like really lean into as well. Uh,

368
00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:50.630
so yeah, I guess we'll see.

369
00:19:50.631 --> 00:19:53.840
But I think definitely going to stay in tech at least,

370
00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:58.400
but really trying to think of ways to like broaden my impact and to help, um,

371
00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:02.120
some of those things that are trying to happen in the world right now. Um,

372
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:05.720
specifically like things like getting more women into tech, um, you know,

373
00:20:05.721 --> 00:20:08.150
also helping my company with their mission, um,

374
00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:12.680
to get more creators paid and help them get a good living salary for the art

375
00:20:12.681 --> 00:20:14.450
that they make. So, yeah, we'll see.

376
00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.970
<v 1>Nice, nice. Super exciting. And yeah.</v>

377
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.190
Do you want to say anything to my 20 viewers?

378
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:25.100
<v 2>Sure. Um, definitely like Jonah's like future, uh,</v>

379
00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:29.240
series is going to be super funny. I saw a teaser of it and it's so funny.

380
00:20:29.241 --> 00:20:32.300
So I'm really excited for that. Um, but also for some self Probo,

381
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:35.060
check out my YouTube channel. Hello my [inaudible]. Um,
