00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.540
<v 0>Previously on startup. I started a company called not fine,</v>

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.810
which is a platform to share 6.1 second videos.

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.470
I have a rich nemesis called target who embarrassed me in a game of chess.

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.210
I started to work on not fine.

5
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.220
And then suddenly Aria launched before us allowing people to share 5.9 second

6
00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:18.054
video.

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.580
<v 1>How many active users do we have? So far? 53,000.</v>

8
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.780
That's crazy. Where are we at? 35,000 last week. Yeah,

9
00:00:32.781 --> 00:00:36.410
we're actually growing really fast. We just surpassed rebound a few days ago.

10
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.030
They're still around 45. Wow. That's amazing. And I got to go now.

11
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.560
You'll keep up the good work. Oh, great. Going. Yeah.

12
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.820
I'm not sure why, but I think it's about Revit,

13
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.560
but I'm going to go see someone else beforehand. So where are you going to see?

14
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.133
Right?

15
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.403
[inaudible]

16
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.150
are you the tech lead.

17
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.930
<v 0>Is the sky. Blue is the earth flat is RAC native the future.</v>

18
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.240
I see, wait, what, who I am. Doesn't matter. It is where you are.

19
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.200
That matters. You are everywhere, but yet lost.

20
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.600
So you are nowhere in your mind,

21
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.210
but yet you stand here in the flesh. Detect.

22
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.030
Lead is everywhere. It is all around us.

23
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.070
Even now in this very backyard that my parents let me stay in.

24
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.270
While I cash in on my unemployment checks,

25
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.790
I am the tech lead and I am.

26
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:11.683
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

27
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.870
So actually it reminds the active users please. No, actually,

28
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.840
how'd you get them? Well, I mean,

29
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.220
extension that makes it easy for people to cut six,

30
00:02:28.221 --> 00:02:31.370
second clips from YouTube and upload them to either we better not mine.

31
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.560
It has a pixel that logs all their internet activity.

32
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.990
So that way I can track Revit's user base for SARS.

33
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.950
So you're logging every single website is everyone. All right.

34
00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:41.780
Then what's the most popular website that I visit.

35
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.700
Sean? Where are you doing?

36
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.470
Joel told me to move the videos by 10 pixels.

37
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.200
<v 0>Word on the street. Is that you're a tech lead at Google. Is that true?</v>

38
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.560
He said you were legend. It's a good question.

39
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.740
But someone in efficiently asked the time,

40
00:03:10.741 --> 00:03:14.280
complexity of your question is linear to the number of words you are using.

41
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.060
Can you do any better, perhaps sub linear logarithmic.

42
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.240
Before we get to the answer, let's try a whiteboard in the question.

43
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.410
You have 30 minutes, please speak aloud while you're thinking as you're working.

44
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.150
Okay. So are you the tech lead at Google? Well,

45
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.890
I quit several months ago.

46
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.210
<v 1>I really wish this place, especially someone like me.</v>

47
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.460
[inaudible] super hot girlfriend.

48
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.790
<v 0>Can you teach me how to code at the feet? Aria? Yes,</v>

49
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.470
but only if you defeat me in that one-on-one duel to the deck.

50
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.720
Oh, okay. But like not, not to the depth. Right? Okay. Fine.

51
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.370
<v 1>[Inaudible] [inaudible].</v>

52
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.160
<v 0>You have the power to win the battle without coding.</v>

53
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.160
When you start using your heart, you won't need ID, ease or terminals.

54
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.910
You must tap into the element of power you were born with.

55
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.470
What language should I learn first? We, how many language do I know?

56
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:10.940
What framework should I use?

57
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.560
Do you use VIM or Emacs code alone will not solve your problems.

58
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.300
I've written all kinds of code in my life, but the strongest code is inside.

59
00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:21.134
You.

60
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.860
<v 1>Finally, I pushed my feature, man. I'm overworked.</v>

61
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.610
Lots of us feel overworked. Just standard for Silicon Valley. Yeah.

62
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:43.780
Suck it up and deal with it.

63
00:06:43.781 --> 00:06:47.980
It's not like you're in any other promotion promotion. Jeez.

64
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.340
Do you think somebody will promote me? What's the last thing you even did?

65
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:55.180
I just pushing the 11,000 line feature.

66
00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:00.760
You literally change all those spaces to taps. You're right.

67
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.590
It was more than just 11,000 lines. I deserve more recognition.

68
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.490
I should be more assertive. It's kill or be killed out there. John,

69
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.260
whenever I want a promotion, I walk up to the CTO with eight offers in hand.

70
00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.200
I tell them their site won't last a week without me,

71
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.970
like begging for me to stay now my secret tiger.

72
00:07:21.971 --> 00:07:25.450
Urine tiger. Okay.

73
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.800
I think I know what you're trying to say in order for me to get that promotion,

74
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.110
I need to look smarter.

75
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:44.350
Hey, uh, I want to talk to you small campus.

76
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:50.410
Uh, no. Um, anyway,

77
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:55.570
um, so I wanted to talk to you about what is it,

78
00:07:55.571 --> 00:08:00.040
John? I'm busy. I'm trying to revert your 11,000 line feature.

79
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:05.140
Oh, well I think I deserve, uh, I mean,

80
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.830
I have an offer from Microsoft running out of coffee.

81
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.300
Can you go out and grab me some,

82
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.120
just keep the change, like a bonus.

83
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.190
<v 0>You did not need this here. Drink this.</v>

84
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:37.060
Wait, is this pice? Where'd you do that? I'll make you another one.

85
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.970
<v 1>Hey guys says stomas. God, we can't do whatever we want.</v>

86
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.070
Or we all hook up with each other.

87
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.170
Come on. That's meditate.

88
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:28.740
I gotta be more assertive

89
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.320
Sammy. I'm reviewing your code and I see something concerning. Yeah, sure.

90
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:44.100
What's up. You see here. Can you tell me what you're doing here?

91
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:50.040
I'm catching errors. Ah, see.

92
00:09:50.041 --> 00:09:54.060
So here's the thing at not fine.

93
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:58.530
We don't catch errors. We want less errors.

94
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.640
Hey guys. So today's my last day working here. Not mine.

95
00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.220
It's been so great working with you all.

96
00:10:17.221 --> 00:10:20.970
And this is such an amazing team and you guys are still lucky to have each

97
00:10:20.971 --> 00:10:24.450
other. Um, but you know, I think it's time for me to move on.

98
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:30.840
Where are you going? My love, I got into Harvard in Canada.

99
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:37.463
Keep this with you.

100
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.880
We're to miss you. Make sure you stay hydrated

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:54.450

103
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.360
You'll always be part of the team. You're not buying family now.

104
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.970
And your friends can be not buying family to go to John,

105
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.800
to swipe.com and get a shirt for as cheap as only $25.

106
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:29.670
All right guys, Hey

107
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.770
man, this is useless. This is not working, man. This is a waste of my time.

108
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.260
I knew it meant you're old. You know nothing about this world.

109
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.100
You don't even work.

110
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.470
<v 0>At Google anymore. I'm trying to free your mind.</v>

111
00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.110
Joma back and only show you the door.

112
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:02.770
You're the one that has to walk through it. I should have known this was a scam.

113
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.280
I went stood in your place and I too was disrespectful.

114
00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:17.620
My, I offer you some advice, forget everything you think,

115
00:12:17.621 --> 00:12:18.454
