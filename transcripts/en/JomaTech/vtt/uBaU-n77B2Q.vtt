00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:06.710
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.300
<v 1>So as most of you know, I recently quit my job as a data scientist,</v>

3
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.000
and I'm trying to get in to sweep and for sweep, if you want to get into sweep,

4
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.080
you have to do these coding interviews and these coding interviews.

5
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.590
They're not supposed to test you if you know how to code,

6
00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:27.860
or if you're good at software engineering, they don't care about that.

7
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.300
Like coding is basically pure intelligence.

8
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.510
You're testing your pure intelligence, your IQ,

9
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.480
you don't actually care if you can do the actual job,

10
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.670
or if they think that you can do, you know, build their infrastructure.

11
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.950
What they care about is if you could like reverse a linked list or solve any of

12
00:00:48.951 --> 00:00:49.910
those coding problems.

13
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.040
And I want to stress that these coding problems are just IQ tests.

14
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.570
They're not meant to show them how good you are at building infrastructure or

15
00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:00.230
anything.

16
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.370
So I just want to tell people who aren't initiated in this suite interview

17
00:01:04.371 --> 00:01:06.710
process, just so that you guys get some context,

18
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.640
like basically someone with no software engineering skills

19
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.980
can pass these interviews because it's kind of like a math test, you know,

20
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.460
and I'm trying to do that anyways.

21
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.970
That's a wake up and I didn't think of a transition, but, um,

22
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.250
here's an ad before we continue.

23
00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:28.400
I just want to say that this video is sponsored by Skillshare.

24
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.410

34
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.940
Skillshare is super affordable with an annual subscription of less than $10.

35
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.650
So I took a couple of classes and I was pleasantly surprised by one of their

36
00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:16.820
classes. It's actually a data science class taught by Frank Kane and Oh,

37
00:02:16.821 --> 00:02:21.560
he's an ex Amazon employee. And it was pretty, pretty good. Like I was very,

38
00:02:21.561 --> 00:02:25.190
very impressed because the thing that's great about his class was it was

39
00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:27.500
actually fully comprehensive.

40
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.670
It taught you from the basics of like Python to teaching how to do linear

41
00:02:31.671 --> 00:02:36.020
regression, to like k-means clustering. It teaches you everything. Unlike,

42
00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:36.380
you know,

43
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.250
a lot of other data science classes where they're just kind of like vague and

44
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:43.130
they're just talking about certain things. This one actually teaches you.

45
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.280
Step-by-step on how to become a data scientist.

46
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.590
It's basically what data science boot camps teach you.

47
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.550
And you can learn all of that using that course, which is really good. Anyways,

48
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.400
the first 500 people to click on the link in the description,

49
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.640
we'll get two months of premium membership for free,

50
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.870
and then you can take any classes you want. So check it out.

51
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.130
<v 0>Yeah. Thank you.</v>

52
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.780
<v 1>In case you don't know what I did. I,</v>

53
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.070
I snapped my fingers and my facial hair went away. Wait, let me show you.

54
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.610
<v 0>See facial hair</v>

55
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.363
clean.

56
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:27.600
<v 1>Truly.</v>

57
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.040
The only reason I shave is for this video because I haven't stepped outside.

58
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.100
<v 0>In like weeks.</v>

59
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.080
<v 1>So as I was saying, I'm basically coding all day every day,</v>

60
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.131
by the way,

61
00:03:41.131 --> 00:03:46.080
I just want to say maybe not a really good idea to quit your job before

62
00:03:46.081 --> 00:03:48.090
getting the offer. So, so yeah,

63
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.680
don't do what I did cause like the unemployment life, you know, it's killing me,

64
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.251
you know,

65
00:03:53.251 --> 00:03:58.080
I'm so disgusting and unmotivated,

66
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.210
you know, it's just like, I feel like, uh,

67
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.020
basically it's just really hard to motivate yourself when you don't have a job.

68
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.550
So I wake up at like 1:00 PM nowadays. Like Holy,

69
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.190
it really shortens my day. Right.

70
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.530
And then all I do is try to solve these coding interviews and Holy

71
00:04:16.531 --> 00:04:19.980
crap, man, don't get in really hard nowadays. Yeah.

72
00:04:19.981 --> 00:04:23.070
I procrastinate like a lot and I don't even,

73
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.650
I don't even wear proper clothes anymore. Cause you know,

74
00:04:25.651 --> 00:04:28.890
I don't need to go out and I start doing like really weird.

75
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.880
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

76
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.200
<v 1>And I have to cook for myself now because from all these years working for Fang</v>

77
00:04:40.201 --> 00:04:45.120
companies, you just become a man child. You know, I'm a big man child.

78
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.520
I have no idea how to cook. So because of that, making food and eating food,

79
00:04:50.521 --> 00:04:52.800
it takes super long. Right.

80
00:04:52.801 --> 00:04:56.070
And then all that time I could have used for like the coding.

81
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.530
So I started wearing an Apple watch because I bought one because I'm

82
00:05:01.531 --> 00:05:02.570
rich. Then,

83
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.660
then I realize I don't even want an Apple watch.

84
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.730
Like I hate watches. I hate wearing watches. It brings no value to me.

85
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.180
It's useless. But I said to myself,

86
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.970
maybe it's because I didn't buy the latest version.

87
00:05:17.971 --> 00:05:19.530
Maybe that's why I think it's useless.

88
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.360
Like I didn't buy the ed mess watch because of that. It's useless.

89
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.550
So I think the idea is that I had to spend more money to make it

90
00:05:29.551 --> 00:05:33.030
useful, but I am trying to make use of it now,

91
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.990
but I'm kind of embarrassed to say, but like it's an,

92
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.000
it's an Apple, it's an Apple watch. Yeah.

93
00:05:42.001 --> 00:05:46.380
I feel so ashamed saying it because like it's an older generation, I don't know.

94
00:05:46.381 --> 00:05:47.730
I'm sorry to disappoint you guys,

95
00:05:47.731 --> 00:05:52.170
but like I am trying to force myself to exercise throughout this process because

96
00:05:52.171 --> 00:05:55.440
I know that if you exercise then your brains going to be more sharp.

97
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.060
And if your brain's more sharp, you perform better in these coding interviews.

98
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.640
Right. So I try to complete those activity rings,

99
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.320
but I realize these things are not very well calibrated because um, Oh yeah.

100
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.860
For example, like one time I was in my room and I was, um,

101
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.700
I was watching pornography and I was also jacking off and by the way,

102
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:18.050
a Jack off of my F hand, which has also the hand I put my watch on, Oh yeah.

103
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.970
Jack off my left hand because you know,

104
00:06:19.971 --> 00:06:23.060
you could use it right hand for the mouse so that I could skip through videos.

105
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.590
So it makes more sense. And it was,

106
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.780
and then suddenly my watch sends me this notification. It said,

107
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.980
I see you're working out. Do you want to record this workout session?

108
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.700
It thought I was doing the ellipticals, you know, like, like, like the,

109
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.520
this exercise. Right. So I thought it was a really,

110
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.670
really funny because I thought it was funny. It,

111
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.160
it's probably not that funny for you guys, but for me it was really funny.

112
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.500
Like you really had to be in the moment to appreciate it.

113
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.690
So basically what I ended up doing is I D I don't even need to exercise because

114
00:06:53.691 --> 00:06:58.430
all I have to do is watch these videos and I get my 30 minutes worth of exercise

115
00:06:58.431 --> 00:07:00.740
done every day. So I'm basically cheating.

116
00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.820
Yeah. So basically coding, it reminds me of,

117
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.420
it really reminds me of school actually like during finals season where you're

118
00:07:10.421 --> 00:07:14.800
just at home, sitting in your room, cramming, studying, practicing.

119
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.630
It really reminds me of that. But I suck, man. I really suck. Like,

120
00:07:19.631 --> 00:07:21.070
I can't even do the easy problems.

121
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.840
I was never good at brainteasers, but yeah, just got to grind anyways.

122
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.160
I just wanted to update you guys on my life and what I'm doing. But, um, yeah.

123
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.790
I mean, I say all this, but Indiana, I kind of like it. Right.

124
00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.780
It's very nostalgic, you know, it's, um, it feels, it feels nice.

125
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.130
Like when you finished problems,

126
00:07:42.131 --> 00:07:44.170
when you do these problems and you get it right.

127
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.100
It feels like practicing for a math test or something very nostalgic.

128
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:53.170
Like basically what I do is I do this Pomodoro style thing, right? So like,

129
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:58.390
um, I solve one problem. I watch one episode of anime. I solve one problem.

130
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.570
I'll watch one episode. I solve one problem.

131
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.410
I watch five episodes of animate to finish the season.

132
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:09.250
If you're also like me doing the coding interview process, I just want to say,

133
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:14.350
yeah, don't give up. It's hard. It's hard for everyone, but it does get easier.

134
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:15.723
And, you know.

135
00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:19.750
<v 3>Say Alico today, keeps the unemployment the way.</v>

136
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.420
So see ya.

137
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:26.080
[inaudible].
