1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.110
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. So I'm not, I still procrastinate,</v>

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.130
but I have, like, I went through this big, like self-improvement phase.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.930
And so yeah. I've like really read a lot about how to not procrastinate. Um,

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.920
so there's this, like,

5
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.880
there's a famous paper that has this like equation of procrastination.

6
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:21.990
And it basically says like, yeah, so there's like, there's like four,

7
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.550
four elements of procrastination.

8
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.200
<v 2>Ever had problems with your Mac,</v>

9
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.270
bunch of garbage making it unbearable to use. Maybe it's time for a clean.

10
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.820
No, not like that. Nope.

11
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.470
That's not it either.

12
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.420
Definitely not that you've given up. Don't worry.

13
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.520

even more viruses on your computer.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.740
this app should be the first app you install on any Mac so you

26
00:01:42.741 --> 00:01:46.910
can monitor apps or files that don't spark joy

27
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.350

study using like Lee coder strategies and stuff like that.

34
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.240
But what about in general? Cause like, um,

35
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.490
I heard that you graduated high school pretty early, right? Yeah. I,

36
00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:26.270
I skipped like a total two grades. Oh my God. Wait.

37
00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:30.590
So when did you go to college again? Yeah, so I was, so I went to college.

38
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.550
I was 16 and my first year of college. Um, but then I was 19,

39
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.360
but yeah, so I, then I took a, I took,

40
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.200
I took an extra semester to graduate because I switched majors late to see us.

41
00:02:42.201 --> 00:02:46.370
I see. Okay. And then in co do you have any tips for college, you know,

42
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.670
for like studying or sleeping? You study a lot to get into college,

43
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.050
like SATs and stuff. Uh, I studied some messages, but I wasn't very motivated.

44
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.470
I was motivated like during your college years? Um, I think, uh,

45
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.430
like sophomore year and up, but like freshman year, I really like up.

46
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.150
Like I got, I got like a really low GPA.

47
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.150
What was it like sub sub one.

48
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.300
<v 3>[Inaudible] actually, yeah. Tony,</v>

49
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.450
I thought you thought you were going to say like 2.9 because that's my

50
00:03:18.451 --> 00:03:22.860
cumulative possible. Yes,

51
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.770
please. I think you told me that.

52
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.670
<v 0>Like that first year, first semester I was at a certain school,</v>

53
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.900
like a better school and then I did really badly cause I did notice study. Okay.

54
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.350
And then I transferred to that, like no name, liberal arts college?

55
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.980
<v 2>Yeah. Okay. Wait, sub one. Does that mean that you felt like most like.</v>

56
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.030
<v 0>Yeah, like absentees or absent C minus it's like basically I didn't go to class.</v>

57
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.000
It wasn't that I like went to class study. Didn't like did bad. Like just like,

58
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.420
I just like, I didn't like depressed or something. I just didn't go to class.

59
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.020
Yeah.

60
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.730
<v 2>Okay. you, you know why it's because you were too young. Do you want to go?</v>

61
00:03:55.731 --> 00:03:56.970
I honestly, yeah, probably.

62
00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.430
<v 0>I wasn't. I wasn't ready to work for emotionally mature.</v>

63
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.593
<v 2>For college.</v>

64
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.750
I think I met a girl that was also 16 years old when she started first year. Um,

65
00:04:05.751 --> 00:04:09.570
I could tell that she was like, Ima Ima like emotionally immature.

66
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.720
And because of that, I think she made a lot of like dumb decisions,

67
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.800
like prematurely saying like, Oh, this is what I want to do. Passion, blah,

68
00:04:16.801 --> 00:04:19.380
blah, blah. And then when things don't work out, she freaks out why?

69
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.650
Because during your whole high school you would be smoking. Right. And you know,

70
00:04:22.651 --> 00:04:23.484
you could do it. Yeah.

71
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.540
<v 0>Yeah, yeah. I wasn't, yeah. I wasn't ready at all. Yeah. You know, what's wrong.</v>

72
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.040
<v 2>Society nowadays. People forget to deal with being bored,</v>

73
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.710
forget to deal with it. They don't know how to,

74
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.500
they don't know how to deal with being bored, you know?

75
00:04:37.501 --> 00:04:38.311
And then because of that,

76
00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:42.930
they have these like advanced AP or like the skip grade and strip that doesn't

77
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.630
that isn't like, wait, I don't, I don't see that.

78
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.450
<v 0>The connection between like I was with you for part of that.</v>

79
00:04:48.451 --> 00:04:51.600
And then you jumped through this like AP like.

80
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.780
<v 2>Okay. Not AP, but like just skipping grades. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like,</v>

81
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:55.680
like for example.

82
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.420
<v 3>Oh, you're saying like, Oh God.</v>

83
00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.411
<v 0>You know, when,</v>

84
00:04:58.411 --> 00:05:00.810
when you're in grade three and you're smarter than everyone else, then,

85
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.840
then you go or whatever. Yeah.

86
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.630
<v 2>But back then we didn't, we didn't have these like AP. Right. People just,</v>

87
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.000
you know, just learn at the same pace as everyone else.

88
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.300
But you could do something for boredom. You just stay in class or you think of,

89
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.470
right? Yeah. Yeah. That's true. I think, I think, I think that's yeah.

90
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.310
And it was uh, Oh yeah. Study. Yeah.

91
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.840
<v 0>Oh, yes. Studying in general. Yeah. Yes. I didn't,</v>

92
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.290
I didn't study at all freshman year. Um, and generally like, I,

93
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:29.490
I never really became a good studier until like,

94
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.240
like maybe like one year out of college and then like,

95
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.890
and then like a year after college,

96
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.420
like I wasn't a good student in college cause like my, my chemo GPA,

97
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.960
even in my new school was like just under three. Um,

98
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.690
I was like, w w what does that in terms of letter grades like a B like, yeah.

99
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.290
Yeah. Um, and so like, and I had,

100
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.040
I got like decent grades in my CS classes and my like philosophy classes,

101
00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.340
but basically when I didn't care about a class, I just like, didn't do for it.

102
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.710
Um, but, um, I think that's kind of always been like my emo,

103
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.220
like if I really care about something, I go like a hundred percent, like all in.

104
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.050
Um, but if I don't then I don't.

105
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.850
<v 2>Um, but yeah. Okay. And then, uh, yeah, I, I guess,</v>

106
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.970
I guess the thing that I want to know more is like, um, you know,

107
00:06:18.971 --> 00:06:21.250
how do you prevent procrastination?

108
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.230
How do you study for like long periods of time and keeping motivated? Yeah.

109
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.360
<v 0>Yeah. So I'm not, I still procrastinate, but I have, like,</v>

110
00:06:31.361 --> 00:06:34.720
I went through this big, like self-improvement phase. And so yeah.

111
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.460
I've like really read a lot about how to not procrastinate. Um, so there's this,

112
00:06:39.461 --> 00:06:43.720
like, there's a famous paper that has this like equation of procrastination.

113
00:06:43.721 --> 00:06:47.800
And it basically says like, yeah, so there's like, there's like four,

114
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.980
four elements of procrastination. And basically, um,

115
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.250
like one element is a expect, expect expectancy.

116
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.270
And basically it means like expecting expectancy is low. Like,

117
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.630
you don't think it's going to happen or like, what do you mean? Like,

118
00:07:01.631 --> 00:07:04.900
basically you might procrastinate something because you don't think you're going

119
00:07:04.901 --> 00:07:07.450
to do well. Uh, so it's like, you don't think.

120
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.660
<v 2>Oh, it doesn't even matter. Yeah. I don't need to leave Cole.</v>

121
00:07:10.661 --> 00:07:12.030
I'm not going to get jobs.

122
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.180
<v 0>Expectancy means like, you know,</v>

123
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.290
your confidence is going to go well or something like that. I might assemble it,

124
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.530
but basically four elements and another woman is like the reward. Um,

125
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.250
and then other elements like, like attention. And then, so basically ideas,

126
00:07:24.251 --> 00:07:28.060
like you want to like, raise like back expectancy and like decrease the tension,

127
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.620
like attention, distraction, and like increase the reward. Uh, and so there's,

128
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.491
there's just like famous,

129
00:07:33.491 --> 00:07:37.920
like flow chart of like ways you can like do that is a flow chart while there's

130
00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:42.610
like this like, like graph thing. Um, I'll find that like, but basically, uh,

131
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.500
yeah, there's a bunch of different techniques. Like I mentioned,

132
00:07:44.501 --> 00:07:48.850
like don't break the chain and then another one is, um, it's called.

133
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.550
<v 2>We explained the don't break the chance since it's going to be a different</v>

134
00:07:51.551 --> 00:07:53.350
video. Oh, yes. Yeah.

135
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:57.490
<v 0>So don't break. The chain is basically like, you try to do, uh,</v>

136
00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.310
whatever you want to do for a little bit of every day.

137
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.790
And then as you do for that day, you just like make a Mark of it. Uh,

138
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.850
and then like you imagine like a big calendar, uh,

139
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.690
you basically want to build up a chain of like exes on marks. Um,

140
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:14.560
and then as the chain goes up, it becomes like more and more like,

141
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.210
there's like inertia or like momentum.

142
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.980
Like you don't want to break it as it gets longer.

143
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.540
You just want to keep it going, right?

144
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.810
<v 2>Yes. Yes, dude. I've been trying to, and I got like a streak. Yeah.</v>

145
00:08:25.811 --> 00:08:28.720
I've been trying to no fat for awhile. Yeah. I guess the chain is,

146
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:31.600
it's just like the idea of like a streak, like a snap snap streak.

147
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.920
<v 0>It came about before all of that. But anyway, uh, then another idea is like, uh,</v>

148
00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:38.110
Pomodoros where you basically just try to.

149
00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:41.140
<v 2>Dude, I minute I heard that word, like, I don't know what it is,</v>

150
00:08:41.141 --> 00:08:43.060
but I see people making videos of that,

151
00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.000
where they just study and people watch that. Yeah. So

152
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.320
just by doing nothing and it was on my door.

153
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.620
<v 0>Pomodora I guess it's the initial meaning is I guess like some kind of like</v>

154
00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:55.950
timer, like tomato timer. Okay. Yeah.

155
00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:59.520
And so basically you just said it and you work for twenty-five minutes and then

156
00:08:59.521 --> 00:09:02.190
you take a five minute break and you repeat, that's literally all it is.

157
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.970
But the reason why it works is because opt-in procrastination happens.

158
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.150
Cause like you can't get started or you don't know where to get started.

159
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.170
So like, or it's intimidating. Right. So it's a lot more intimidating to like,

160
00:09:13.171 --> 00:09:17.250
think about studying for four hours then is to think about just let's just do 25

161
00:09:17.251 --> 00:09:20.250
minutes. Right. And so it's like, it's basically just about breaking it down.

162
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.800
<v 2>Yeah. I think starting is the hardest part, like even for videos or anything.</v>

163
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.920
Okay. So I've, I've been unemployed for a while, right? Yeah. And then Holy.

164
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.160
I told myself, I was like, Oh, I'm going to make videos and do all that.

165
00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.750
I didn't do anything. You know? And,

166
00:09:33.751 --> 00:09:36.980
and I didn't do anything with my time either because like, it just so hard,

167
00:09:36.981 --> 00:09:39.290
like starting. Right. And I think that's the hardest part,

168
00:09:39.291 --> 00:09:41.630
but then once it gets started, the flow is a lot.

169
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:45.080
<v 0>Exactly. Yeah. That's another thing. Right? Like flow, that's a big,</v>

170
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:49.340
I think if you can get into a state of flow, so flow is basically just like, um,

171
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.400
like you're totally immersed. You don't notice time passing and like,

172
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:53.263
if you can just stay flow,

173
00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:57.760
it's basically impossible to be like distracted or to like procrastinate. Like,

174
00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.760
cause you're just like totally in the moment, like, like mindfulness,

175
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.160
like a hundred percent attention. Um,

176
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.460
and so you can get to that state by gamefication or by, you know,

177
00:10:07.461 --> 00:10:10.580
being intrinsically interested in like the journey then that helps a lot.

178
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:14.210
<v 2>Oh, that makes sense. I was in the flow when I was drawing. Actually,</v>

179
00:10:14.211 --> 00:10:17.900
there's one thing that, uh, I want to talk about for procrastination.

180
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.150
I always procrastinate,

181
00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.840
but I procrastinate by doing other stuff that's productive.

182
00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.200
<v 0>Yeah. So actually that's a,</v>

183
00:10:24.201 --> 00:10:27.560
that's actually a technique it's called structured procrastination.

184
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:32.030
Basically the, imagine a list of things you like have to do or like want to do,

185
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.040
then you think about like,

186
00:10:34.041 --> 00:10:36.170
so the thing on the top is like something you really need to do,

187
00:10:36.171 --> 00:10:37.130
but you don't want to do it,

188
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.890
but there's something else right below it that's like also pretty important,

189
00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:40.670
but you will,

190
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:44.690
you don't want to do it like the amount to which you don't want to do it isn't

191
00:10:44.691 --> 00:10:45.710
as high as the first one.

192
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.250
So you can procrastinate the first one we did the second one. Right.

193
00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.720
And so eventually as long as the first one,

194
00:10:50.721 --> 00:10:53.600
isn't like super important then still. Yeah. You're still yeah.

195
00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.350
<v 2>Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It's like, yeah. That makes a lot of sense. Yeah.</v>

196
00:10:57.351 --> 00:11:01.700
That's pretty cool. I remember, wait, what was my procrastination thing? Like,

197
00:11:01.701 --> 00:11:03.860
it's probably like, Oh, back then. It was like, Oh,

198
00:11:03.861 --> 00:11:06.920
I don't want to work on fate. Like at Facebook for some.

199
00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:09.890
And then instead of just videos, videos. Yeah.

200
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.660
I think that's why I was so productive. And then when I meet to make videos.

201
00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.180
<v 0>Because it becomes like a chore it's like not. Yeah.</v>

202
00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.100
<v 2>And then I think then I did laundry.</v>

203
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:21.910
<v 0>Yeah. Can just clean up or yeah.</v>

204
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:23.800
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

205
00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.860
But the issue is that is whenever there's like the top priority things is really

206
00:11:27.861 --> 00:11:30.710
important that you have to do it, but yeah. But then again,

207
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.500
if it's really that important and there's a timeline, sorry,

208
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.130
there's like a deadline. I usually do pretty well right before this.

209
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.180
<v 0>Definitely. Yeah. No, me too. I think. Um, yeah. That's another thing it's like,</v>

210
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:45.200
uh, like the force of the desperation. Yeah, of course. Yeah. But it's like,

211
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:49.520
it's also risky because it's the one thing I've noticed personally is that like,

212
00:11:49.521 --> 00:11:52.670
as I build up the history of doing stuff right before the deadline,

213
00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:57.730
and as I've built up a history of successfully do the margin becomes smaller and

214
00:11:57.731 --> 00:12:00.130
smaller because like I'm afraid my brain is like, dude,

215
00:12:00.131 --> 00:12:02.920
there's no need to panic. I've done this five minutes.

216
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:04.780
Like let's just do four minutes this time. Right.

217
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.570
And then eventually it's going to crash eventually.

218
00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.830
It's not going to work anymore. Yeah.

219
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.030
So you need to like trick a brain and saying like, don't be that confident.

220
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.930
Like this might be the time or like you just like fail and the next time.

221
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.780
<v 2>Lisa. Yeah. Yeah. And then, but the issue at work, I feel like, um,</v>

222
00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:22.650
I feel like at work,

223
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:26.860
a lot of deadlines are actually like soft deadlines self-imposed yeah. No.

224
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.440
And I've been, self-imposed even worse than that.

225
00:12:28.441 --> 00:12:30.900
Like imagine a PM does either or a manager tells you to do that.

226
00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:32.610
They have a margin of error. Also.

227
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.570
They actually know that you might not that you know, and then I don't know,

228
00:12:36.571 --> 00:12:38.820
I've learned to be like, he's doing leisure at work,

229
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:42.330
but without the negative consequences, sometimes, you know,

230
00:12:42.331 --> 00:12:44.820
it's like pushing back, pushing back. Yeah. No, but that's a good,

231
00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:48.450
that's a good skill to pushing back. Cool. Cool. Cool.
