<v 0>NICU.</v>

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.940
I just saw your Instagram story says how impressive.

3
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.670
How on earth did you get a reservation there? Lucky.

4
00:00:08.671 --> 00:00:13.200
I guess that's a wonderful race. Don't tell me, don't tell me,

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.020
let me guess Patagonia and Keela.

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.530
If you're so sad or compliment was sufficient. Kevin. Hello, Raj.

7
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.780
Nice glasses. How the hell are ya?

8
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.830
Paul has mistaken me for this Dick Russia sawn.

9
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.380
It seems logical because Raj also works in infra.

10
00:00:30.381 --> 00:00:32.240
And in fact it's the same exact thing I do.

11
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.310
And he also has a pension for Patagonia vests and Gucci glasses. Roger,

12
00:00:36.311 --> 00:00:38.420
and I even go to the same Cooper cafe and Palo Alto.

13
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.000
Although I order a slightly more expensive drink.

14
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.190
How's the Gemini project going? It's uh, it's all right. Oh, that's interesting.

15
00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:50.240
That's not, it's not great. Oh, well, you know? Hmm. How's uh,

16
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.960
how's Cecilia. She's uh, she's a great girl. Yes,

17
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.610
I'm very lucky. Hey Paul, congratulations on the Leo project.

18
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.840
Thank you, Jimmy. Listen, Paul bouldering. Sure. When,

19
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.760
how about Friday? No, can do I got an eight 30 Rez at Sasol.

20
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.900
It's got a great C or chin. So each Friday night,

21
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.810
how do you swing that? I bet he's lying.

22
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.660
New keys. What do you think?

23
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.900
Whoa, look at that.

24
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.360
Picked it up on Amazon yesterday. Good switches.

25
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.700
Their blues and the O rings or point twos. That's very cool when to kill,

26
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.040
but that's nothing. Look at this.

27
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.820
That is really nice. That makes Brown wood plant fours.

28
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.070
What do you think? Jesus,

29
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.370
this is really super. How does the name it? Like you get so tasteful?

30
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.040
I can't believe that Brian prefers Sam B as keys to mine, but wait,

31
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.290
you ain't seen nothing yet.

32
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.810
Obsidian black and green switches.

33
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.810
Impressive. Very nice.

34
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.930
Let's see John Elton's keys

35
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.500
look at that said lock like coloring, but tasteful actuation force.

36
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.590
Oh my God. The keys aren't even labeled

37
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.630
NICU, something wrong. You're sweating.

38
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.920
Okay. So you're telling me, I just opened the app. I type in how long I, uh,

39
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.370
how often and what color it is. And at the end of the week,

40
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:11.830
it's going to tell me what medical conditions I have. Yeah.

41
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.210
And if you get the premium version,

42
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:16.450
you'll actually also find out how long you have to live. Wow.

43
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.150
That is really nice. So this one's premium. Yeah.

44
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.700
So if you actually take a look and if the color turns red,

45
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:22.720
that means you have until.

46
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.780
