1
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.150
<v 0>Yes.</v>

2
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.120
<v 1>You probably already know. Uh,</v>

3
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.100
I finally got a software engineering job now I'm super grateful and

4
00:00:16.101 --> 00:00:19.820
super relieved that I don't have to interview anymore. I mean,

5
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.380
interviewing is super stressful and it's not that fun.

6
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.380
Like I really hate interviewing well, I mean,

7
00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:30.500
actually I think I hate before interviewing,

8
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.540
cause that's when you get the most stressed,

9
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.290
but then when you're interviewing and if you're actually doing really well,

10
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.690
it actually feels kind of good. It feels kind of good,

11
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.170
but I'm glad I don't need to lead code anymore. I mean,

12
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.620
I did it so much that it kind of became a habit every day.

13
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.060
I just go home li code a little bit and a part of me kind of

14
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.840
a part of me kind of wants to just continually coding every day,

15
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.680
just to keep my skills fresh, my interviewing skills fresh, you know,

16
00:00:57.681 --> 00:00:59.960
you never know if you want to switch jobs or not.

17
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.970
So the reason why I didn't say anything for the longest time is because I didn't

18
00:01:04.971 --> 00:01:05.810
want to jinx it.

19
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.940
I wanted everything to be confirmed and finalized before telling you,

20
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.950
but, uh, yeah, I've been working for a few weeks now and um, yeah,

21
00:01:15.951 --> 00:01:18.860
it seems okay. I think I got the job for sure now,

22
00:01:18.861 --> 00:01:23.190
so I can tell you guys now, so due to privacy concerns, um,

23
00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:28.040
I'm not gonna share which company it is. Um, maybe once I quit,

24
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.540
I can share which company it is, but, um, you know,

25
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.610
I don't plan on quitting anytime soon,

26
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.820
but I can tell you that the company is part of Fen.

27
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.170
<v 0>Good Todd, good Todd.</v>

28
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.370
<v 1>I'm incredibly happy that I got this job offer. Uh,</v>

29
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.050
I'm actually really grateful and um, yeah,

30
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.610
like it's always kind of been my dream job back then and uh, yeah,

31
00:01:55.611 --> 00:01:58.010
so for, for transparency sake, uh,

32
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.240
I have a total compensation of 278,000 for the first year.

33
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.010
And then in the later years, it's less than that because I had a sign-on bonus.

34
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.930
So I want to tell you exactly how I transitioned from data scientists to

35
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.610
software engineer from the day that I wanted to switch to software

36
00:02:16.611 --> 00:02:17.240
engineering.

37
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.050
So I was still at Facebook when I decided to transition into software

38
00:02:21.051 --> 00:02:23.360
engineering. I talked to my friends, uh,

39
00:02:23.361 --> 00:02:28.100
one of them was a data engineer who switched into software engineering to

40
00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:31.010
get some info. I asked them about different companies,

41
00:02:31.011 --> 00:02:33.380
what the culture was like, um,

42
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.710
what kind of questions they ask during interviews? What was the pay?

43
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.590
How long does it take for the recruiters to respond back?

44
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.110
What tech stack they use, et cetera, et cetera.

45
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.210
So I was just gathering information.

46
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.260
So I kind of already had a list of companies that I wanted to apply to during

47
00:02:48.261 --> 00:02:51.380
the same week I refreshed my Python skills. I mean,

48
00:02:51.381 --> 00:02:53.150
I haven't coded in like forever.

49
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.570
I think the last time I coded was during my internship at LinkedIn,

50
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.280
which was winter 2015. I used two before,

51
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.500
but I decided to relearn or slash learn Python three just because it's newer.

52
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.000
And it's almost the same thing except for a few little syntax differences.

53
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.100
So I had to relearn how Python does their list, comprehensions array, strings,

54
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.840
Lambdas, their syntax for dictionaries, their string stuff.

55
00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:23.410
And also like common libraries that we would usually use in a coding interview.

56
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.720
So that took me about two days. Yeah.

57
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.220
Then I started li coding and I actually just focused on the easy

58
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:33.940
questions and the reason why is because I couldn't even do them.

59
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.440
So I wouldn't even try to do the medium questions until I could flash the easy

60
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:41.710
questions by the way, no one uses the term flash. Uh,

61
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.070
I use the term flash because in a bouldering,

62
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.820
when you flash a climate means you did it in one shot.

63
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.950
So for interviews, I mean for interview questions, I say,

64
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:58.600
you flashed a question if you just run it once and you get it on your first try

65
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.100
without looking at the answers.

66
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.080
So I did about 30 to 40 easy questions before I can actually flash

67
00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:10.030
these easy questions. And that took about two to three weeks, not bad.

68
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.590
I did like one to two questions a day. I was slowly practicing.

69
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.240
I mean, I still had a full-time job, so I didn't have that, that much time.

70
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.400
I was also kind of sad at that time.

71
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.570
So I exercise a lot to try to cope with that.

72
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.980
And that also took away from my coding time failing these legal question.

73
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.880
Really. Wasn't great for my self-esteem. Especially at the beginning,

74
00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:38.830
when I was failing all of these questions, it, it felt pretty bad.

75
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.430
I mean, like my self-esteem was pretty low. And then in addition,

76
00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:46.300
you have to grind these questions and every question that you miss, you just,

77
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.330
Oh, you're a failure. So it was kind of hard in the beginning,

78
00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:53.280
but in the end it was worth it. After that,

79
00:04:53.281 --> 00:04:56.250
I started doing medium questions now to this day.

80
00:04:56.251 --> 00:05:00.210
I don't think I can flash medium questions. I mean, they're pretty hard.

81
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.360
Some medium questions are a lot easier than others. Uh,

82
00:05:03.361 --> 00:05:06.000
it really depends because it kind of depends on your strengths and your

83
00:05:06.001 --> 00:05:09.930
weaknesses. Some of them I could flash, but some of them, I cannot,

84
00:05:09.931 --> 00:05:13.110
I can't even solve them. So it's kind of hard to say,

85
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.300
but I still did a lot of them.

86
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.870
And then the more you do that use your debit card. In the meantime,

87
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.520
I decided to actually start applying to jobs because I told myself that I needed

88
00:05:23.521 --> 00:05:26.010
to put deadlines because without deadlines,

89
00:05:26.011 --> 00:05:28.890
I'm just going to Slack and I'm not going to practice seriously.

90
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.600
So I polished my resume because my resume was kind of built in a more data

91
00:05:33.601 --> 00:05:35.220
science PME role.

92
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.120
So a lot of the bullet points I had to change to make it more software related.

93
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.190
For example, for my data science job,

94
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.880
I would focus more on the data engineering aspect of the job.

95
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.620
And then for my PM experience,

96
00:05:46.621 --> 00:05:50.430
I would talk about how I prototyped these products,

97
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.720
which requires coding so that I could present it to clients and stuff like that.

98
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.940
Getting interviews was actually really easy for me because I've built a

99
00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:02.270
foundation ever since I started doing internships.

100
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.800
So over the course of all those internships, I've built connections, friends,

101
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.210
you know, and whole network of recruiters slash friends.

102
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.790
So for literally any tech company,

103
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.230
I have at least a friend who works there or a recruiter that I can contact

104
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.170
because I've already interviewed there for internships.

105
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.180
The reason why I can contact these recruiters is because back then when I was

106
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:29.690
interviewing for internships, uh, I actually got offers from them.

107
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.490
And because they remember me,

108
00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:35.330
they'll answer my email and they'll give me at least a phone interview. So yeah,

109
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.650
Waterloo's this because you get a whole network of tech professionals,

110
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.540
you'll get a referral for any company.

111
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.380
Do you want to apply for as long as you made friends back in college and I don't

112
00:06:45.381 --> 00:06:48.530
want to brag, but I had a handful of friends in college.

113
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.450
So I wanted to study full-time and go ham on the coding because I knew that

114
00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:55.580
getting the interviews was not my problem.

115
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.220
My problem was actually passing the interview.

116
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.760
So I decided to quit my job and Lee code full-time,

117
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.040
but that didn't happen.

118
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.480
I ended up doing YouTube a lot and I pretty much studied the same amount as

119
00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:12.920
before. Okay. Maybe not the same amount, but just a little bit more.

120
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.250
So I studied about like two to four hours a day,

121
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.860
which means like three to five questions.

122
00:07:18.861 --> 00:07:21.710
I usually do about three to five questions per day.

123
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.730
And then maybe on the weekends, slightly more, maybe five hours.

124
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.360
I was getting more and more familiar with the questions I was recognizing the

125
00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:31.430
patterns I was learning the tricks. Right.

126
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.380
And it's not even about intelligence or, or being smarter or anything.

127
00:07:36.381 --> 00:07:40.070
It's literally just practice because the questions end up looking the same,

128
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.120
the only change the context or the wording or the storyline behind it.

129
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.560
But it's essentially the same thing.

130
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.300
So four weeks later I had my first phone interview and,

131
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:55.160
uh, I passed almost all of them because it's, they're, they're not super,

132
00:07:55.161 --> 00:07:57.530
super hard. It's only like a first smokescreen.

133
00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:01.970
And most of the time you might get a question that you've seen already on Lee

134
00:08:01.971 --> 00:08:05.450
code. So that makes it a lot easier. It's technically kind of cheating,

135
00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:08.240
but whatever, after the phone interviews,

136
00:08:08.241 --> 00:08:12.590
I also asked to push the on-site interviews as far as possible because I just

137
00:08:12.591 --> 00:08:15.560
wasn't confident in myself yet. So I wanted more time to study.

138
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:19.040
So I did like 150 to 200 questions by then,

139
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.820
but I didn't feel like I was getting that much better.

140
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.730
So I bought the book elements of program. Oh, we, I think I have it.

141
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:31.010
So I bought the book elements of programming interviews in Python because I

142
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:34.100
wanted to practice coding using a pen and paper,

143
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.620
unlike using a computer and the platform,

144
00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:41.600
because that is a lot more similar to when you're asked the question

145
00:08:41.601 --> 00:08:43.550
using a whiteboard during interviews.

146
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:48.560
I think it's similar to hard mode when you use pen and paper to write your

147
00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:52.700
code because you have to be a lot more thoughtful because you can't erase.

148
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.010
Then during real interviews,

149
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.050
I actually have a whiteboard and I could use the eraser.

150
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.150
It's going to feel a lot easier.

151
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.830
So two or three days before the onsite interview, I would stop doing YouTube.

152
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.220
And now I would study all day for three days,

153
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.740
I would order delivery so that I don't waste time.

154
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.030
So I would study around 10 to 12 hours per day. Before the interview,

155
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.780
I would do a combination of lead code and paper coding using elements of

156
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:19.890
programming interview.

157
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.060
I would also go to Glassdoor to look at the interview question for that specific

158
00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:25.560
company and do them.

159
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.030
I also ask around my friends to see what kind of questions they got during their

160
00:09:30.031 --> 00:09:32.310
interview. Usually the questions won't be the same,

161
00:09:32.311 --> 00:09:36.540
but at least you get a sense of what the company's like to ask. For example,

162
00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:40.950
Facebook, they don't ask dynamic programming questions, but Google,

163
00:09:40.951 --> 00:09:43.830
they love to ask the NAMIC programming questions.

164
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.130
If I learned that the company asks system design questions,

165
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.970
then I would go read grokking the system design interview.

166
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.530
And I would just try to, you know, take everything in and hope that I remember.

167
00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:00.510
So at that point I've done around 230 questions on the code and I don't know how

168
00:10:00.511 --> 00:10:02.040
many I've done on pen and paper.

169
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:06.450
I actually overstudied because there were so many things that I practice for

170
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:10.980
that I didn't use. Like for example, union find for disjoint sets.

171
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:11.963
I didn't use that.

172
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:15.770
<v 2>Um.</v>

173
00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.050
<v 1>Sorry. I can't think of any examples. Um,</v>

174
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:21.980
I've already forgotten everything I've learned because I already got an offer,

175
00:10:21.981 --> 00:10:23.060
so I don't get, so yeah,

176
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:27.890
I passed few of those interviews and I felt some of them and then using

177
00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:28.641
the offers,

178
00:10:28.641 --> 00:10:33.470
I kind of negotiated so that my TC will go up and then until no one can increase

179
00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:38.090
anymore. I just accepted the offer saying it. Now it doesn't sound like much.

180
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:42.320
It's just study and that's it. But while I was studying,

181
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:44.150
Holy, I felt like.

182
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:49.460
But I was lucky that I had roommates and friends to support me when I

183
00:10:49.461 --> 00:10:53.990
most need them to tell me that I'm being too hard on myself to calm me

184
00:10:53.991 --> 00:10:58.070
down. And also thanks to tech lead.

185
00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.170
He actually coached me along the way.

186
00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:05.060
And whenever I felt or whenever I needed mock

187
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:08.210
interviews, he was always there. Now I know in our video,

188
00:11:08.211 --> 00:11:10.190
sometimes it looks like we hate each other.

189
00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.410
Some people don't realize those are jokes,

190
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.710
but I've actually grown quite close to him,

191
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.550
especially for the fact that he helped me, not just for the interviews,

192
00:11:19.551 --> 00:11:23.210
but just in general for my mental health. So tech lead,

193
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:27.650
I know you're watching and I made this collage for you.

194
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.380
<v 3>This California weather, it's like 90 degrees.</v>

195
00:11:33.381 --> 00:11:36.020
It's making me hot and he has the same effect on me.

196
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:40.220
It's just so dumb about the way that he's making me feel my insights around.

197
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.070
I just want to shout his name. Uh,

198
00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:47.780
my body's given up on me cause I don't know what to do with my fingertips.

199
00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:52.150
Uh, I want to run through his hair, but I'm trying not to stare.

200
00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:01.020
<v 1>Now.</v>

201
00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:05.880
I know that I'm incredibly lucky to have guidance and I already have so

202
00:12:05.881 --> 00:12:09.540
many connections in the industry already, but even then,

203
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:14.730
I don't think I could have persisted without the support of my friends and

204
00:12:14.731 --> 00:12:15.564
tech lead.

205
00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:20.370
So I really don't think that people should go through the interview cycle alone.

206
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:23.430
That's why tech lead. And I, we worked really,

207
00:12:23.431 --> 00:12:27.270
really hard on this program called tech interview pro.com.

208
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:32.100
And we want you guys to not be alone during this process.

209
00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:37.050
It's a video course and a community where we all learn how to get jobs at these

210
00:12:37.051 --> 00:12:40.260
big tech companies and supporting each other while we do it.

211
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.060
It's a small group so that technically,

212
00:12:42.061 --> 00:12:46.290
and I can put a lot more time helping people in the program.

213
00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.080
We get to answer your questions during our live sessions.

214
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:53.610
And we also have a lot of code sessions where we showed you how to solve the

215
00:12:53.611 --> 00:12:57.560
most popular questions that are asked by Fang. Anyways, if you're interested,

216
00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:01.350
check out tech interview pro.com, uh, I'm super psyched about the program.

217
00:13:01.351 --> 00:13:05.010
I'm actually really, really happy that we did this. But other than that,

218
00:13:05.011 --> 00:13:09.420
I kind of just wanted to say again that thank you for understanding when I was

219
00:13:09.421 --> 00:13:11.280
away from YouTube for so long.

220
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:16.290
And thank you for everyone who sent all these positive messages to me,

221
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.350
encouraging me to find a new job in software engine.

222
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:24.330
<v 3>I really, really appreciate that. Thank you so much.</v>

223
00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:26.363
I love you.

224
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:36.900
It's a new chapter in my life. I think it's a pretty good start.
