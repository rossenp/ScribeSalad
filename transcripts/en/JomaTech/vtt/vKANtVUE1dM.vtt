00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.300
<v 0>Two bedroom, two bathrooms, 1300 square feet,</v>

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.450
waterfront luxury apartment with a dope view,

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.150
great amenities like a swimming pool.

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.120
I'll never use and also private marinas,

5
00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:16.620
but no one can afford a boat because the rent is too high.

6
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.550
So welcome to my crib, that a sheriff to a roommate.

7
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.970
What's poppin.

8
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.800
Welcome to my new and improved the apartment because I'm hella rich.

9
00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:47.690
Now that YouTube money,

10
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.710
dude, I can't give you a ride. I don't have a car. Why don't you have a car,

11
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.910
dude? I spend all my money on this apartment. I can't afford a car. Boom.

12
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.660
Anyways, the first part of the tour is the kitchen.

13
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.980
First is a super cool Japanese knives. Look at this amazing.

14
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.600
It's actually only this one's fine,

15
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.970
but we also have a super cool marble Island, which is really,

16
00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:14.804
really nice.

17
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.760
And then we have this super cool rice cooker that actually uses machine

18
00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:23.810
learning technology to cook the rice perfectly. And it's actually true.

19
00:01:23.811 --> 00:01:27.440
I'm not joking. It's like fuzzy logic. You should search it up. Unfortunately,

20
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.530
my roommates are not home, so we have like no groceries.

21
00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:35.030
So there's probably going to be empty. Oh my God, what blue apron?

22
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.190
It's not empty at all. This video is sponsored by blue apron. Ah,

23
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.220
thank you so much. Blue apron for sponsoring this video.

24
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.020
So now I can pay my boy Matt show. So don't forget.

00:01:53.031 --> 00:01:56.840

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.430
Matt, can you cook for me while Matt is cooking the food?

28
00:02:01.431 --> 00:02:04.850
Let me tell you a little bit about our sponsor. So blue apron,

29
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.480
it allows you to create delicious chef designed recipes at home.

30
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.960
So it's super convenient, perfect to impress a hot date.

31
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.880
And the thing I liked the most about it,

32
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.390
price start as low as seven 49 per serving,

33
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.010
which is way cheaper than eating out, which is perfect for people who are cheap.

34
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.150
Like me also, if you have commendment issues like me,

35
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.470
it's okay, because you can skip or cancel the service at any time.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.060

39
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.740
So yeah, [inaudible]

40
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.940
all right back to the apartment tour. Now next let's check out the dining area.

41
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.920
Wow. Oh my God. Matt show.

42
00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:55.370
Thank you for leaving all your junk on my dining table. But yeah,

43
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:56.960
when macho isn't here,

44
00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.550
it's like a beautiful dining table and there's chess set and we usually eat

45
00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:04.570
here, but Oh, well. And then let's go to the living room.

46
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.850
My favorite thing about my living room is the projector because you can Netflix

47
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:14.610
and chill or even better. My YouTube channel, Hey, was topping.

48
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.120
So then the next thing is, Oh yeah, let's check this off. You know,

49
00:03:18.121 --> 00:03:21.630
if you're watching TV, you could plug your phone and charge your I-phones.

50
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.030
And if you're an Android user, what is too bad,

51
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.290
but it doesn't matter because your battery probably isn't trash. All right.

52
00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:30.450
And then if you go over to this couch,

53
00:03:30.451 --> 00:03:34.470
you could see my beautiful metal corgis, but you know,

54
00:03:34.471 --> 00:03:37.470
what's cuter my little group assistant right here.

55
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.530
So Groot is actually my lighting assistant,

56
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.770
which is pretty cool because I could tell him to turn on the lights and he will

57
00:03:43.771 --> 00:03:46.830
check this out group, turn on the light. Oh.

58
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.680
I'll get checked out. Turn off the light group.

59
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.400
Turn off the light. Okay. Um,

60
00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.050
sometimes groups can be a little bit stubborn, but I love him. All right.

61
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.450
So next let's check out the coffee table.

62
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.220
Now what does a coffee table need a coffee book?

63
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.380
So this is twice really cute. Love my love, my K-pop stuff. All right.

64
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.390
And that's it for the living room. Let's go to my room. All right.

65
00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:23.070
And to make sure that people know that's my bedroom, we got this big, big Moji.

66
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.690
And also we got my roommate greeting people coming in and also my dope

67
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.650
painting. All right. Let's go to my room. Come on in, come on in.

68
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.330
So welcome to my bedroom where all the magic happens and by magic,

69
00:04:36.331 --> 00:04:40.740
I mean the magic of editing. But yeah, anyways, if you look over here,

70
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.750
you're going to see a painting of a girl,

71
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.290
which is probably the closest thing I'll ever get to having a girl. My bedroom.

72
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.070
Anyways, I do like paintings. So,

73
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.510
which is why I have three paintings over here. This is abstract art.

74
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.730
It's pretty hard to comprehend the meaning of this.

75
00:04:56.731 --> 00:05:00.660
So I'm not even gonna bother trying to explain to you guys. All right.

76
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.920
So here's my station, my battle station, where I edit all my videos,

77
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.340
got my microphone and my a tissue box. Stan got my LG monitor,

78
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.000
got my laptop. And Oh my God, we got a Kiwi bird. So cute.

79
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.520
And then we also have the ducks here. Pretty cute. Here.

80
00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:24.810
We have my personal laptop that I use to watch my favorite videos on red too.

81
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.490
I mean on YouTube red.

82
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.010
And then here is a lot of gorilla pods for filming and stuff like that on my

83
00:05:32.011 --> 00:05:36.600
hard drive. Oh wow. Here. I got four iPhone,

84
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.000
you know, one for each girl, not just testing devices, but whatever.

85
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.900
And then finally my beautiful bed.

86
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.810
I do miss my bunk bed. You know? I mean,

87
00:05:48.811 --> 00:05:51.420
you guys complain about my bunk beds saying like, Oh my God,

88
00:05:51.421 --> 00:05:53.790
why you still have a bunk ban or shut a door? Or here we go,

89
00:05:53.791 --> 00:05:55.950
I got a queen size bed. No. And guess what?

90
00:05:55.951 --> 00:05:59.660
It's actually such a waste of space because I literally sleep like this.

91
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.130
So there's so much space time wasting. Oh my God.

92
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:05.570
And it's not like I have a girlfriend.

93
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.120
So if you're a girl I'm watching this video,

94
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:10.970
don't forget to slide into my dance. Cool. My kidding man.

95
00:06:10.971 --> 00:06:13.280
I don't have any girls viewership anyways.

96
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.490
Let's go to the bathroom and onto the bathroom.

97
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.160
Now let's see what I have here. I have some cotton pads, cued tips.

98
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.270
I got toothbrush. I got makeup roof mover for my non-existent girlfriend.

99
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.190
And then also I got these little cloth they're super expensive,

100
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:33.830
but I thought there were something else anyways.

101
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.090
And then the great thing about this bathroom is that you can watch a videos.

102
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.400
Wow. You get ready.

103
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.440
And also the cool thing about this surface book is that you can actually detach

104
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:46.490
it. Look at this.

105
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.160
<v 1>Oh my.</v>

106
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.520
<v 0>God. I hate surface books, man. They always break.</v>

107
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.050
Okay. So I can't attach it right now because the surface book sucks.

108
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:01.120
<v 1>Oh.</v>

109
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.980
<v 0>My God. It's Oh my God. Okay. It's working now.</v>

110
00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.440
And you get to attach it and watch your favorite videos while you take a

111
00:07:08.441 --> 00:07:11.440
shower, you know, so you can be entertained.

112
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.910
And then it's also attached to this. Uh, what is it? Youi boom speaker.

113
00:07:15.911 --> 00:07:17.050
So you can make it real loud.

114
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.570
<v 1>Are you kidding? Right.</v>

115
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.590
[inaudible].

116
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:35.260
<v 0>All right. In case you're wondering why I bought a surface book.</v>

117
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.570
I did not buy a surface book. Okay.

118
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.440
I got the surface book for free when I did an internship on Microsoft.

119
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.440
And the reason why they gave it out for free is because they know that this

120
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.100
piece of hardware will become irrelevant. Just like my YouTube channel.

121
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.210
But anyways, so, okay, this. Let's put it back.

122
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.240
And this is the worst tour ever.

123
00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.213
<v 1>Okay.</v>

124
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:00.580
<v 0>Uh, anyways, let's talk about this mirror.</v>

125
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.660
A lot of people love this mirror because it's perfect for selfies,

126
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:08.800
but I think it's a little bit too Bryce because it covers all my flaws,

127
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.910
my complexion, and also my deep insecurities that repressed 20 years ago.

128
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.260
But it also makes my abs look good. So I guess that's fine, but yeah,

129
00:08:17.261 --> 00:08:21.880
let's wrap up the tour. So come on out. All right.

130
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.030
Thank you so much for checking out the tour with me. Now,

131
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.930
if you liked this video, don't forget to like and subscribe. So yeah.

132
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.070
Hope you enjoyed the tour and have a great day. Peace.

133
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.540
Can you feel me a little bit again? Okay. Peace out.

134
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:43.210
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

135
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:46.780
<v 0>That's about it. Can you do it? We'll sakes, man.</v>

136
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.530
That's it for new form of the tour. Thank you so, so much.
