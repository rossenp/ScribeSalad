00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.510
<v 0>Previously on startup. I started a company called not [inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:03.510
, which is a platform to share 6.1 second videos. I have a rich nemesis called 

3
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:03.510
Aria

4
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:03.510
 who embarrassed me in a game of chess. I started to work on not fine. And then suddenly Aria 

5
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.343
launched and returned before us allowing people to share 5.9 second videos.

6
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.240
<v 2>You beat me to it, man. He launched Revine to,</v>

7
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.540
for not buying what a sly man.

8
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.300
<v 1>He knew exactly.</v>

9
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.030
<v 2>What he was doing and he just cut me off just like that.</v>

10
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.880
And now I'm not the first anymore. It's crazy. Like, you know,

11
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.250
I don't even know why he asked to do that. I mean, it doesn't,

12
00:00:49.251 --> 00:00:50.540
he have already enough money.

13
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.490
It's just crazy, man.

14
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.730
Like every time I feel like I hit a brick wall and then I get so close to what I

15
00:00:58.731 --> 00:01:01.790
want and then boom, another brick wall.

16
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.243
<v 1>It's frustrating.</v>

17
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.330
<v 2>Sometimes just feels like a, like a stupid game.</v>

18
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.590
Like someone's looking over my shoulders, just like making a fool out of myself.

19
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.290
It's making me running around like an idiot

20
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.730
And that you're hungry, man. I kind of forgot you were here. Nah, I'm good.

21
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.153
<v 1>Cool.</v>

22
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.313
<v 2>Do you ever feel like</v>

23
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.720
We're part of a show or something like old obstacles?

24
00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:42.800
We come up against this so hard. They seem like they're impossible,

25
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.660
but the very last second we always solve it.

26
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.430
It's like the Truman show with Jim Carey. Do you ever feel that way?

27
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.630
Nope. Not at all. I don't know what you're talking about.

28
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.070
<v 1>Not even like a little bit.</v>

29
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.080
<v 2>You mean like imagine if this whole thing,</v>

30
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.730
this whole situation that we're in is all just for a web series for like a

31
00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:15.590
YouTube channel or something. Is that what you're saying? Yeah. Come on,

32
00:02:15.591 --> 00:02:19.670
man. That's so silly and yeah, way too much imagination. I mean,

33
00:02:19.671 --> 00:02:23.600
if we were a web series, it would be a pretty boring web series and worst thing.

34
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.093
<v 1>[Inaudible]</v>

35
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.700
which is why I think you are.

36
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.800
<v 3>Definitely the best school to go to. Right.</v>

37
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.240
Like get here. Um,

38
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.400
we were just outside and then we walked here. Yeah.

39
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.020
But what was the path that we keep from the

40
00:03:19.021 --> 00:03:23.910
path? Dude? We just took the road. Yeah.

41
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.553
Okay. Whatever.

42
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.270
<v 1>Come with me sandwiches. Oh gosh.</v>

43
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.733
<v 3>Yeah. Sure.</v>

44
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.610
<v 1>All right.</v>

45
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.120
<v 3>So let me tell you why Revit as a huge threat to our success,</v>

46
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.350
it all comes down to marketing. Basically the perception of our brands.

47
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.920
Now nobody knows about non-fire, but everyone knows about Revit.

48
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.180
Suddenly he became the first mover and in marketing that is extremely important,

49
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.160
especially for a product like not fine or refined perception to be the

50
00:04:11.161 --> 00:04:14.820
best is actually way more important to actually be the best. I mean,

51
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.920
let's say our servers can handle, you know,

52
00:04:16.921 --> 00:04:21.330
way more requests and our UI slightly better. Does that make us the best? No,

53
00:04:21.331 --> 00:04:22.110
not really.

54
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.970
Because in people's minds where you find what's the first looping video company,

55
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.630
hence the best company. And since they've launched before us,

56
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.470
they can brand themselves as whatever they want because the public will believe

57
00:04:34.471 --> 00:04:36.480
them. Now let's take an example.

58
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.800
Think catch-up what company do you think makes the best ketchup Heinz.

59
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.400
Exactly hindsight, but that's because there were first movers.

60
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.740
That's what you think they're the best. Now you're thinking about it.

61
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.480
Who do you think the second company is for? Catch-ups exactly. You don't know.

62
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.400
Nobody cares. Nobody cares when your second,

63
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.140
everyone only cares when you're at first.

64
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.620
So same thing for Jack Daniel's for whiskey and like Tesla for electric cars.

65
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.400
That's why we need to be the first for the looping videos, but we're not.

66
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
So basically now people think of looping videos. They'll think of Revine,

67
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.240
not non-client that's because they are the market leader.

68
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.020
And no matter what we can't be first anymore, however,

69
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.210
not all is lost though.

70
00:05:15.211 --> 00:05:17.880
We can not be first in the looping video sharing platform.

71
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.220
We can try to be first and something else.

72
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.120
Basically we have to avoid the competition and come up with our own product

73
00:05:24.121 --> 00:05:28.740
category. Here's an example. IBM used to be the leading company for computers.

74
00:05:28.741 --> 00:05:31.920
Right. But then other companies wanted to get in on the action.

75
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.280
Like have you heard of borough control data NCR or Sperry.

76
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.290
<v 1>Shoe company? No, I'm talking about computers right now.</v>

77
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.090
Why would I talk about shoes?

78
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.440
<v 3>Those were companies that want to make computers.</v>

79
00:05:46.441 --> 00:05:51.150
Also the only one who succeeded and often called the second largest computer

80
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.420
company was DEC, why were they successful?

81
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.150
Because they weren't competing in the computer market.

82
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.150
They were competing in the microcomputers.

83
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.210
So they were the first microcomputer product category.

84
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.890
What happened to the other companies?

85
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.880
Those other companies were too focused on getting people to like their brand,

86
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.560
which is extremely hard by the way,

87
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.330
because once a perception is made by a person it's really hard to change their

88
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:15.164
minds.

89
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.550
What they should have done is to try to think of a category that tick a thrive

90
00:06:19.551 --> 00:06:22.670
on and be first that people don't give a what's better.

91
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.960
They care about what's new. So here's my proposal in new category,

92
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.760
we are going to make for our non looping videos on our platform

93
00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.500
for hours changes. That was a joke.

94
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.320
But yeah, and I just haven't thought about anything yet, but I mean,

95
00:06:42.321 --> 00:06:46.580
we have to pivot that TECO drive will really the number on us,

96
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.380
all the VCs, every engineer, they all know about Revit.

97
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.570
Everyone in the Valley knows about Revit. Yeah.

98
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.240
I mean, we basically lost her first mover advantage.

99
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.830
Wait, everyone in the Valley knows about it.

100
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.410
Wait, was it only tech question on what about it? Yeah.

101
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.120
When we tech folks wrote about it, dude, nobody in the family makes videos.

102
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:22.130
Only tech nerds know about Revit. Revit is first in the minds of engineers,

103
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.990
but during all their target.

104
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.820
So we're not too late to be the first in the minds of creators and social media.

105
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:39.813
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

106
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:43.683
<v 2>You know,</v>

107
00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:48.820
always want to weird like why on a boat?

108
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:52.090
If you keep a dock here the whole time, it's like, you're trapped.

109
00:07:52.091 --> 00:07:56.860
You're forever kind of like us. Right. Wait, what do you mean?

110
00:07:58.930 --> 00:07:59.763
I didn't say anything.

111
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:07.540
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

112
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.380
<v 2>You know, if you want to try owning a boat, I got this great game.</v>

113
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.970
Boating simulator. Got it. Try it. It's really realistic.

114
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:20.290
It's really realistic.

115
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.320
It's really realistic.

116
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:30.483
<v 1>Path.</v>

117
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.130
<v 2>Sandwiches kind of like us, right?</v>

118
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.313
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

119
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:03.390
<v 3>Hey Dom, can I talk to you for a sec? Yeah, what's up?</v>

120
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:08.730
So I ran the simulation. You're asking me to and not by one.

121
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.090
Yeah. Um, they're not fine. One.

122
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:16.110
We've got the preliminary results of the experiment and it looks like the

123
00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:19.710
success rate is only about 17% should be terminated.

124
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.130
Now let's keep it running. There's always a chance to metrics will increase.

125
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.530
How are the other simulations going? Well,

126
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.770
some of the other seem promising like vitally and vine book.

127
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.770
I continued to report and highlight the features that are most predictive of our

128
00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:34.560
success. That'll be great, but let's keep an eye on that.

129
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.780
Not by I'm really curious how it ends.

130
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.180
It might just tell us the perfect launch strategy

131
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:53.540
what's popping April 4th, everybody. So yeah. Uh, we are not in assimilation.

132
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:57.530
This episode is not part of the Canon, so don't worry about that.

133
00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.070
So I just want to say, um, thank you for watching this episode. If you liked it,

134
00:10:01.071 --> 00:10:04.640
if you like it, don't forget to subscribe. And then also like this video.

135
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.680
Thank you so much. Uh, just a little bit announcement.

136
00:10:06.681 --> 00:10:10.790
I am going to take a break on the startup series. I'm going to skip episode six.

137
00:10:10.791 --> 00:10:14.600
So instead of doing it next month, I'm going to do it next next month. Uh,

138
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:15.620
sorry about that,

139
00:10:15.621 --> 00:10:18.470
but I need to take a break and the reason why I'm taking a break is actually

140
00:10:18.471 --> 00:10:22.460
because I want to make more videos and these videos take a long time and I kind

141
00:10:22.461 --> 00:10:25.670
of want to try to make two videos a week for the next month.

142
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.590
A lot of exciting stuff that I'm going to do.

143
00:10:27.591 --> 00:10:31.190
So hopefully you're going to enjoy the content I'll put out later. But yeah,

144
00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.750
so of course start-up series.

145
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.730
You're going to have to wait a little bit for that. Thanks.
