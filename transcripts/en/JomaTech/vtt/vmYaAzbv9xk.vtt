00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.170
<v 0>So there was a question on tech interview pro in our private group.</v>

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.300
And there was a question to ask,

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.890
what are your thoughts on career outlook for senior data scientists versus

4
00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:12.360
senior data engineer?

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.380
If someone has a choice between the two rows for their next job advancement,

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.200
which one would you suggest? Um,

7
00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:23.550
so I answered this and I kind of wanted to make a video talking about this

8
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:28.140
question too, because I have a lot of things to say. And,

9
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.580
um, as you know, I worked at Facebook back then. I used to be a data scientist.

10
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.270
I think I could say it now. We'll see. But, um,

11
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.160
personally I do feel that data engineers are sometimes

12
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.720
a little bit like a second class citizen. I mean, sometimes data scientists too,

13
00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:49.740
but I feel like data engineers can feel like that a little bit more.

14
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.650
Now my roommate is a data engineer,

15
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.730
so don't tell him that. But, um,

16
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.660
I personally think in a product heavy company culture, uh,

17
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.400
I'd say that PM's are to first-class citizen and then data scientists

18
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.460
and then data engineer, if we're talking in the data space.

19
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.520
And the reason is because PMs,

20
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.430
they often are the ones who make executive decisions.

21
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.670
They're the ones who kind of own the feature on the product. Right.

22
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.740
And then for that, they tend to ask the DS a lot for product questions like, Oh,

23
00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:27.090
what are user retention? Oh, can we cut this by, um, by country?

24
00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:31.080
Or can we cut this by this? And they have a lot of data asks and in some sense,

25
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.440
it's a little bit of like work because they just want to get it done.

26
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.550
But then they realized that, Oh, you know this information,

27
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.210
they actually don't even care about it,

28
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.320
but they just want to know just because of their curiosity.

29
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.950
And it doesn't actually change the decision of the product that happens a lot.

30
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.310
And then for the DS to do those data, ask,

31
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.420
they need the data to be structured in a certain way. So then because of that,

32
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:57.330
they asked, did the ease to do it, right? So as you can see,

33
00:01:57.331 --> 00:02:01.680
it's a chain of work, right? DS the data scientists,

34
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.360
they don't get impact for helping PM's answer to curiosity Des data

35
00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:06.900
engineers.

36
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.160
They don't get impact from creating these temporary tables or temporary

37
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:15.660
pipelines, just to ask as just to serve this one task for the data scientists.

38
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.540
So that's why, um, you know,

39
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.770
it's like the lower you are in the chain of. Sorry, not,

40
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.020
but like the task, the more it tends to be, uh, not that impactful,

41
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.943
right?

42
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.080
So I believe that politically being a S is better

43
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.200
than being a data engineer. I also talked about, you know,

44
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.720
politics at work a lot. And, uh,

45
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.230
I think a lot of people misunderstood what I said. They think that, Oh, no,

46
00:02:43.231 --> 00:02:46.830
it's terrible. There's lots of politics, but I didn't say that it's a bad thing.

47
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.370
Politics is part of life. Politics is part of society.

48
00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:52.740
When we have multiple people working for different things,

49
00:02:52.741 --> 00:02:53.880
having different incentives,

50
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.050
politics is super important and you should be extremely good at it because that

51
00:02:58.051 --> 00:02:59.920
is how you negotiate.

52
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:04.210
That is how you get together with a lot of people with different incentives so

53
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:07.840
that you can all commonly work on the same goal, right.

54
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.460
Or even if it's on the same goal,

55
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:13.030
you could work on different things such that it's mutually beneficial for each

56
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:17.050
other. Cool. Now the thing is, yes,

57
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:18.970
there's a lot of like crappy work going down.

58
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.940
And then that's usually what DS managers and D managers do.

59
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.410
They try to fend off these ridiculous requests so that their report can be a lot

60
00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:29.740
more productive in real work. Right. Okay.

61
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.270
So let's talk about D S or D E versus D S.

62
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.550
So I have a lot of friends, um, that are data engineers. And to be honest,

63
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.050
they say that they don't really like data engineers that much because, um,

64
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.840
because in some sense it's not intellectually challenging,

65
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.700
especially at a big company where a lot of these hard distributed data

66
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:53.830
problems are already solved, right?

67
00:03:53.831 --> 00:03:57.340
So you're not going to be doing any spark or Hadoop jobs and stuff like that.

68
00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:58.480
These are, these are abstracted.

69
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.460
The thing you do as a D is you mostly write sequel based stuff,

70
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.030
right. SQL based pipelines, because that's the easiest way to write it.

71
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.820
And they have abstracted, everything such that it makes it easy.

72
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.000
And then what you have to do is you just have to organize your product areas,

73
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:17.380
data, and you have to monitor these ETL pipelines and all of these things,

74
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.190
they're basically like, um, like sequel kind of work,

75
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.580
or just like maintenance and using the, um,

76
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.060
the tools that we've already been that have already been built. Right.

77
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.440
And you also get paid less than a software engineer. So I think a lot of people,

78
00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:34.330
a lot of data engineers, at least at Facebook,

79
00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:35.830
I don't know about any other companies.

80
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.550
They're a little bit more dissatisfied because their job is less intellectually

81
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:41.620
stimulating and to get less equity.

82
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.340
So I think that's one of the biggest cons of data engineer,

83
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.920
but I am biased because I was a data scientist.

84
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.520
So I might not know a lot of things about data engineers. Cool.

85
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.170
So for data science, analytics, and I mean analytics,

86
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.530
especially for people who want to get into data science and they don't have a

87
00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:03.400
master PhD in something very particular like in machine learning,

88
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.150
usually you're going to be ending up doing data science, analytics. Now,

89
00:05:07.151 --> 00:05:10.930
most people come into this thinking that it's like big data or like machine

90
00:05:10.931 --> 00:05:11.764
learning kind of thing,

91
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.110
but they quickly get this appointed because they realize that it's

92
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:19.090
not that's, that's not what it is. Right.

93
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:21.310
Especially if you're a new grad coming from school,

94
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.740
unfortunately you're not going to be doing any, um,

95
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.200
innovative machine learning algorithm stuff.

96
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:28.330
You're not going to be inventing anything. Right.

97
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.250
You have to be a little bit realistic. So,

98
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.600
but I do personally think that data science analytics is super rewarding, right?

99
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.063
Like, um,

100
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.290
like the thing about new grads is they focus too much on the technical part

101
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:42.730
of work. You know,

102
00:05:42.731 --> 00:05:47.100
they focus too much on trying to grow in terms of their technical skills, which,

103
00:05:47.101 --> 00:05:49.630
which makes sense, because in the beginning you need technical skills,

104
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:54.310
you need these foundational skills to be useful in work, to do stuff. Right.

105
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.750
But to be honest,

106
00:05:55.751 --> 00:06:00.410
the technical part is usually the easiest part of the job at a large

107
00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:05.150
company, at least like, um, if you want to be a data scientist,

108
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.230
then you're the person that loves to think about the product,

109
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.830
loves to think about what to do next for the product.

110
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.120
And you want to be the expert on the product because you love digging into the

111
00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:19.190
data, finding, uh,

112
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.660
finding insights and then using these insights to help the company or help the

113
00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:27.650
product become better and increase those metrics. Right.

114
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.143
And yeah,

115
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.350
so that is actually what a data scientist is supposed to be.

116
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.550
You are the core of the strategy and direction of the product

117
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.680
and your super power is that you're able to transform raw data

118
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.610
into strategic decisions. That's your job. It's kind of like, you know,

119
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:48.110
when we talk about programmers,

120
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:53.330
they transform red bull into workable software. Right. It's kind of like that.

121
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:58.070
So I do think that it doesn't really

122
00:06:58.071 --> 00:07:02.150
matter what job you choose because the people who advance the most,

123
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.130
the people who succeed at work or people who do not restrict themselves to

124
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.870
dirt job function. Right.

125
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.920
And you should always be striving think like, um,

126
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.750
what can I currently do with my set of skills that would have the most

127
00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:20.420
impact on my team? Like, that's what you're supposed to do.

128
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.120
That's how you're supposed to choose which job do you want to do.

129
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.240
It depends on what skills or interests you have the most,

130
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.480
but then once you're at the job, do not restrict yourself, right?

131
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:33.890
Because the people who do not restrict themselves are the ones who, um,

132
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.230
who succeed the most. For example,

133
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.430
I wrote a few examples like engineers with data analytics skills,

134
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.210
where you can do is as an engineer, you could find user problems yourself.

135
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:48.860
They can to the data, find issues of your product, right? And then now you know,

136
00:07:48.861 --> 00:07:51.830
that there's a great future opportunity because of your data skills.

137
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.300
And then you could argue for it, like, uh, with your, with their PM team,

138
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.370
with your product team and then just build it.

139
00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:02.900
And then that would have a lot of impact. And then if you're a PM with, uh,

140
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.280
with engineering skills, then you can prototype an MVP. You can,

141
00:08:07.281 --> 00:08:11.300
or you can create an experiment for a feature and then just build it out and

142
00:08:11.301 --> 00:08:15.140
then test it out and then see that there's positive metrics or that it's good

143
00:08:15.141 --> 00:08:18.860
for the, or you found product market fit. If that experiment that 1% experiment,

144
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.150
and then boom, there you go.

145
00:08:20.151 --> 00:08:24.710
You you're able to create an MVP and then validate your

146
00:08:24.711 --> 00:08:28.850
hypothesis and then have this project up in the high priority list on your

147
00:08:28.851 --> 00:08:33.200
roadmap, high impact for PMs as a data scientist. If you have PM skills,

148
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:38.330
then essentially you can set the vision and also the roadmap for your team,

149
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:39.470
because you know,

150
00:08:39.471 --> 00:08:43.070
you're able to have the data skills to back up all of your arguments for what

151
00:08:43.071 --> 00:08:46.790
should be the high priority stuff to do for the company or for your team.

152
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.030
And then you're able to prioritize all of these features, because like I said,

153
00:08:50.031 --> 00:08:53.570
you have these data skills and then because you have this leadership skills or

154
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.440
these PM skills that I said, you have,

155
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.830
you're able to launch your team to success because of that.

156
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.600
So even if you have a weak PM, you could carry the team. So, I mean,

157
00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:07.530
in conclusion, pick a job according to your skills and,

158
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.080
but never restrict yourself on your job title.

159
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:13.770
They pay you to invest in you so that in the future,

160
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.420
you could make a huge difference.

161
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:20.520
So take that opportunity to invest in yourself so that you could be a beast

162
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:21.563
at everything.

163
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:31.370
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>
