00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.970
<v 0>Data science is not about making complicated models.</v>

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.140
It's not about making awesome visualizations and it's not about writing code

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:07.591
data.

4
00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:12.450
Science is about using data to create as much impact as possible for your

5
00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:16.110
company. Now, impact can be in the form of multiple things.

6
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.760
It could be in the form of insights,

7
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.200
in the form of data products or in the form of product recommendations for a

8
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:24.450
company. Now to do those things,

9
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.370
then you need tools like making complicated models or data visualizations or

10
00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:32.700
writing code, but essentially as a data scientist,

11
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.050
your job is to solve real company problems using data.

12
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.720
And what kind of tools you use. We don't care.

13
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.850
Now there's a lot of misconception about data science, especially on YouTube.

14
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.800
And I think the reason for this is because there's a huge misalignment between

15
00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:55.400
what's popular to talk about and what's needed in the industry.

16
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.740
So because of that, I want to make things clear.

17
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.640
I am a data scientist working for a gaffa company,

18
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.740
and those companies really emphasize on using data to improve their

19
00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:10.700
products. So this is my take on what is data science.

20
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.130
<v 1>Before.</v>

21
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.580
<v 0>Science.</v>

22
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.780
We popularized the term data mining in an article called from data mining to

23
00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:29.870
knowledge, discovery and databases in 1996,

24
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.220
in which it referred to the overall process of discovering useful information

25
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.420
from data in 2001, William S.

26
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.880
Cleveland wanted to bring data mining to Nutter level.

27
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.360
He did that by combining computer science with data mining.

28
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.540
Basically he made statistics a lot more technical,

29
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.530
which he believed would expand the possibilities of data mining and produce a

30
00:01:51.531 --> 00:01:53.360
powerful force for innovation.

31
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.630
Now you can take advantage of compute power for statistics,

32
00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.650
and he called this combo data science around this time.

33
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.510
This is also when web 2.0 emerged where websites are no longer

34
00:02:05.511 --> 00:02:06.740
just a digital pamphlet,

35
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.270
but a medium for a shared experience amongst millions and millions of users.

36
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.880
These are websites like MySpace in 2003 Facebook in 2004 and YouTube

37
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.150
in 2005, we can now interact with these websites,

38
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.840
meaning we can contribute post comment, like upload share,

39
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.630
leaving our footprint in the digital landscape.

40
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.500
We call internet and help create and shape the ecosystem.

41
00:02:30.501 --> 00:02:34.760
We now know and love today. And guess what? That's a lot of data,

42
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.810
so much data. It became too much to handle using traditional technologies.

43
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.820
So we call this big data that opened a world of possibilities and finding

44
00:02:43.821 --> 00:02:45.140
insights using data.

45
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.130
But it also meant that the simplest questions required sophisticated data

46
00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:52.070
infrastructure, just to support the handling of the data.

47
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.750
We needed parallel computing technology like MapReduce, Hadoop, and spark.

48
00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.260
So the rise of big data in two 10 sparked the rise of data science to support

49
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:06.220
the needs of the businesses to draw insights from their massive unstructured

50
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.293
data sets.

51
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.950
So then the journal of data science described data science as almost everything

52
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:14.500
that has something to do with data collecting,

53
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:19.150
analyzing modeling yet the most important part is its applications,

54
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.760
all sorts of application. Yes,

55
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:26.080
all sorts of applications like machine learning. So in 2010,

56
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.880
with the new abundance of data,

57
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.410
it made it possible to train machines with a data driven approach rather than a

58
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:33.640
knowledge driven approach.

59
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.850
All the theoretical papers about recurring neural networks,

60
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.400
support vector machines became feasible.

61
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.450
Something that can change the way we live and how we experience things in the

62
00:03:43.451 --> 00:03:48.370
world. Deep learning is no longer an academic concept. In these thesis paper.

63
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.140
It became a tangible useful class of machine learning that would affect our

64
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:54.250
everyday lives.

65
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.530
So machine learning and AI dominated the media or shadowing every other aspect

66
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.120
of data science, like exploratory analysis, experimentation and skills,

67
00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:06.730
we traditionally called business intelligence.

68
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.850
So now the general public think of data science as researchers focused on

69
00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:17.440
machine learning and AI, but the industry is hiring data scientists as analysts.

70
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.270
So there's a misalignment there. The reason for the misalignment is that yes,

71
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.170
most of these data scientists can probably work on more technical problems,

72
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.600
but big companies like Google, Facebook,

73
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:32.710
Netflix have so many low hanging fruits to improve their products that they

74
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.330
don't require any advanced machine learning or statistical knowledge to find

75
00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:39.070
these impacts into our analysis,

76
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.660
being a good data scientist isn't about how advanced your models are.

77
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.310
It's about how much impact you can have if your work you're not a data cruncher,

78
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.400
you're a problem solver. You are strategists.

79
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.790
Companies will give you the most ambiguous and hard problems,

80
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.590
and we expect you to guide the company to the right direction. Okay?

81
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.330
Now I want to conclude with real life examples of data science jobs in Silicon

82
00:05:04.331 --> 00:05:07.060
Valley, but first I have to print some charts.

83
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.213
<v 2>So let's go do that.</v>

84
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.880
This is you don't live here anymore. You can't just come in whenever you want.

85
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.310
Can you drive to the office? No,

86
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:35.850
thanks for that.

87
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.380
[inaudible].

88
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.760
<v 0>This is a very useful chart that tells you the needs of the eScience.</v>

89
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.850
Now it's pretty obvious, but sometimes we kind of forget about it.

90
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.030
Now at the bottom of the pyramid, we have collect,

91
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.410
you obviously have to collect some sort of data to be able to use that data.

92
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.360
So collect, storing,

93
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.830
transforming all of these data engineering effort is pretty important. And it's,

94
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.430
it's actually quite captured pretty well in media because of big data.

95
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.880
We talked about how difficult it is to manage all this data.

96
00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.190
We talked about parallel computing,

97
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.900
which means like Hadoop and spark stuff like that. We know about this.

98
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.560
Now the thing that's less known is the stuff in between,

99
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.600
which is right here, everything that's here. And surprisingly,

100
00:06:46.601 --> 00:06:49.240
this is actually one of the most important things for companies,

101
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.900
because you're trying to tell the company what to do with your product.

102
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.280
So what do I mean by that?

103
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.360
So I'm in analytics that tells you using the data.

104
00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.690
What kind of insights can you tell me what are happening to my users?

105
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.890
And then metrics. This is important because what's going on with my product.

106
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.040
You know, these metrics will tell you if you're successful or not.

107
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.010
And then also, you know, AB testing of course,

108
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.990
experimentation that allows you to know which product versions are the

109
00:07:16.991 --> 00:07:19.180
best. So these things are actually really important,

110
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.860
but they're not so covered in media. What's covered in media, is this part, AI,

111
00:07:23.861 --> 00:07:26.980
deep learning. We've heard it on and on about it, you know,

112
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.980
but when you think about it for a company, for the industry,

113
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:34.180
it's actually not the highest priority or at least it's not the thing that

114
00:07:34.181 --> 00:07:36.820
yields the most result for the lowest amount of effort.

115
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:41.230
That's why AI deep learning is on top of the hierarchy of needs.

116
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.350
And these things AB testing analytics,

117
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:46.480
they're actually way more important for industry.

118
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.960
So that's why we're hiring a lot of data scientists that does that.

119
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.690
So what do they, the scientists actually do well,

120
00:07:52.691 --> 00:07:56.890
that depends on the company because of them as of the size. So for a startup,

121
00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.550
you kind of lack resources. So you can only kind of have one DS.

122
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.250
So that one data scientist, he has to do everything.

123
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:07.330
So you might be seeing all of this being a data scientist.

124
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.960
Maybe you won't be doing AI or deep learning because that's not the priority

125
00:08:10.961 --> 00:08:13.120
right now, but you might be doing all of this.

126
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.610
You have to set up the whole data infrastructure.

127
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.660
You might even have to write some software code to add blogging,

128
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.820
and then you have to do the analytics yourself.

129
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:25.570
Then you have to build a metrics yourself and you had to do AB testing yourself.

130
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:29.020
That's why for startups, if they need a data scientist,

131
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:34.030
this whole thing is the science. So that means you have to do everything,

132
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.330
but let's look at a medium sized company. Now, finally,

133
00:08:37.331 --> 00:08:38.530
they have a lot more resources.

134
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.430
They can separate the data engineers and the data scientists.

135
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:46.360
So usually in collection, this is probably software engineering.

136
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:51.580
And then here, you're going to have data engineers doing this.

137
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:55.860
And then depending if your medium size company does a lot of recommendation

138
00:08:55.861 --> 00:09:00.150
models or stuff that requires AI, then DS will do all of this,

139
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.570
right? So as a data scientist, you have to be a lot more technical.

140
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:08.100
That's why they only hire people with PhDs or masters because they want you to

141
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.190
be able to do the more complicated things.

142
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:15.630
So let's talk about large company now because you're getting a lot bigger.

143
00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:18.090
You probably have a lot more money and then you could spend it more on

144
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:18.924
employees.

145
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.050
So you can have a lot of different employees working on different things.

146
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.770
That way the employee does not need to think about this stuff that they don't

147
00:09:25.771 --> 00:09:28.440
want to do. And they could focus on the things that they're best at.

148
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.980
For example, me at my untitled large company,

149
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.810
I would be in analytics.

150
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:37.560
So I could just focus my work on analytics and metrics and stuff like that.

151
00:09:37.561 --> 00:09:41.190
So I don't need to worry about data engineering or AI, deep learning stuff.

152
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:46.830
So here's how it looks for a large company, instrumental logging, sensors.

153
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.550
This is all handled by software engineers, right?

154
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.610
And then here cleaning and building data pipelines.

155
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.710
This is for data engineers.

156
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.710
Now here between these two things.

157
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:03.900
We have data science, analytics, that's what it's called.

158
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.960
But then once we go to the AI and deep learning,

159
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:10.320
this is what we have research scientists,

160
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.060
or we call it data science core.

161
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:19.380
And they are backed by ML engineers,

162
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.760
which are machine learning engineers. Yeah. Anyways.

163
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.160
So in summary, as you can see data,

164
00:10:26.161 --> 00:10:31.020
science can be all of this and it depends what company you are in

165
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.850
and that definition will vary.

166
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.810
So please let me know what you would like to learn more about AI,

167
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.420
deep learning or AB testing experimentation,

168
