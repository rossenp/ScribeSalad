00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.920
<v 0>I'm going to tell you how he got from 50 subscribers to 25,000 subscribers.</v>

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.250
In two months, I'm going to break this down into three sections.

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.080
The first section is what happened.

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.290
I'm going to tell you exactly what videos I posted and how many subscribers I

5
00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:16.800
got. And then the second section, how did it happen? I'll go more into details,

6
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:20.520
into explaining where on YouTube and which videos actually brought me to views,

7
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.000
which eventually led to subscribers. And then finally the most important part,

8
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.990
why it happened,

9
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.500
which I'll explain my thought process in each video I made and also the strategy

10
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.700
execute it and how it paid off. Now, before I start this video,

11
00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:35.910
I just want to say that my growth is not a hundred percent merit.

12
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.290
I use a lot of unfair advantages, but on the last section,

13
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.760
which is why it happened.

14
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.210
I talk about a lot of fundamental concepts that you should understand.

15
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.670
If you want to grow your YouTube channel. All right, are you ready?

16
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.110
I'm going to go pretty fast.

17
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.380
First, I started with 50 subscribers. I haven't touched my account for months.

18
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.230
I was gaining about maybe one or two subscribers a week.

19
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.120
I only had two videos uploaded,

20
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.820
but that was because I was waiting for one thing to happen.

21
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.450
And that thing to happen was a collaboration with another YouTuber.

22
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.810
So on December 7th, when UCO published our collaboration,

23
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.140
she posted a video that was about how to get an internship.

24
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.070
And I posted the video. That was an interview with her. At that time,

25
00:01:19.071 --> 00:01:22.970
she had 60,000 subscribers. So the moment she posted that collaboration,

26
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.710
I got 178 subscribers on that day and the next day 102

27
00:01:27.711 --> 00:01:30.230
subscribers. So basically within two days,

28
00:01:30.231 --> 00:01:33.980
I went from 50 subscribers to 345 subscribers.

29
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.420
And then for the rest of the month,

30
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.790
I was gaining on average 30 subscribers a day,

31
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.580
which is a huge leap for my one to two subscribers a week.

32
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.110
I also posted video called how I got an internship at Citadel on December 23rd.

33
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.660
So with the momentum gained by my Yukos,

34
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.890
co-lab decided to split into two shows, one to start up series,

35
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.510
which is a mockumentary about a fake startup I'm creating and to the tech show,

36
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.230
which is to teach people how to get into Silicon Valley and get a successful

37
00:02:00.231 --> 00:02:01.130
career out of that,

38
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.750
this piece is kind of important to remember when I go through the why section of

39
00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:10.310
this video on January 1st, I hit 1000 subscribers and I released my fifth video,

40
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.090
which is the second video of my startup series, right after I released it.

41
00:02:14.091 --> 00:02:17.810
I gained 100 subscribers that day. And then for the next few days,

42
00:02:17.811 --> 00:02:20.330
I was averaging a Brown, a hundred subscribers also,

43
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.250
but later on on the house section of the video,

44
00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:25.310
you'll quickly realize that it's not because of that video.

45
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.670
It was actually because of something else, even though the timing seemed right,

46
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.520
it's not because of my start-up series. On January 8th,

47
00:02:31.521 --> 00:02:35.930
I celebrate my 1000 subscriber Mark by making a video about AirPod giveaway

48
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.310
and that did not help at all, but gave me Instagram and Twitter followers.

49
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.420
And then three days later,

50
00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:44.090
I made a video called how I got an internship at LinkedIn.

51
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.110
And then on January 18th, many things happen. I posted a video called engineers,

52
00:02:48.111 --> 00:02:52.280
answer your CS questions. And I also started live streaming regularly,

53
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.170
and I made a discord channel.

54
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.970
And the following week I live stream seven times in five days between January

55
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.580
and January 23rd, I average about 110 subscribers a day,

56
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.290
which got me to 3,400 subscribers at the end.

57
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.750
But that was right before the most successful video of ever posted on January

58
00:03:12.751 --> 00:03:13.470
24.

59
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.850
I posted a day in the life of a Facebook engineer and that video

60
00:03:17.851 --> 00:03:20.400
skyrocketed my growth. The day I posted,

61
00:03:20.401 --> 00:03:25.320
I gained 180 subscribers. And then five days later because of that video,

62
00:03:25.321 --> 00:03:29.010
I was gaining about 2,300 subscribers a day.

63
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.310
So within five days I already reached 10,000 subscribers.

64
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.450
And during that time I kept live streaming a lot on February 1st,

65
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.040
I posted my third start-up episode that actually didn't do much at all because

66
00:03:41.041 --> 00:03:44.280
most of my subscribers still came from that day in the life video.

67
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.390
But my growth was slowing down and I was gaining about 1000 subscribers a week

68
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.720
as a group was slowing down. I published a second day in live video.

69
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.110
So that bumped me back up to around a thousand subscribers a day.

70
00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.090
So from February 1st I had about 14 subscribers and now I only took 10

71
00:04:00.091 --> 00:04:04.740
days to get to 25,000 subscribers because I was averaging about 1000 subscribers

72
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.730
a day. And there you have it, 25,000 subscribers in two months.

73
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.350
Now it's all good to know what happened.

74
00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:14.130
And usually it would be pretty obvious to see which video actually caused the

75
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.880
increase in subscribers, but let's dissect the growth a little bit more.

76
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.560
All right. So one fundamental concept. That's pretty obvious,

77
00:04:22.561 --> 00:04:26.490
but you still have to keep in mind is that to grow your subscriber account,

78
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.520
you have to have non-subscriber views,

79
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.310
meaning you have to reach new audiences.

80
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.180
So let's look at which videos start reaching new audiences and how let's start

81
00:04:36.181 --> 00:04:37.200
with the Manuka video.

82
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.230
So why was my interview with my UCO getting so many views?

83
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.980
The first thing is that she had a huge audience. She had 60,000 subscribers,

84
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.551
you know,

85
00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:48.480
it's bound to happen that some of our viewers will be curious enough about me

86
00:04:48.481 --> 00:04:51.690
because I'm in their video to search me up and to look at my videos.

87
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.400
But additionally, when UCO added an end card and that was vital to my growth.

88
00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.210
So that end card linked to my video, the interview with her.

89
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.240
So if you look at the analytics, as you can see for the first few days,

90
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.340
I got my views mostly from end screens and channel pages. But then as you see,

91
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.590
as time goes by, if I look at the week later,

92
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.090
I was getting more views from suggested videos and even recommended videos from

93
00:05:15.091 --> 00:05:16.710
the homepage. That's what they call home.

94
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.890
Browse features the reasons because people watching the Yukos video,

95
00:05:19.891 --> 00:05:24.000
like our co-lab started watching my video right afterwards because of the end

96
00:05:24.001 --> 00:05:24.690
card.

97
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.500
But then later on you to figure it out that a high percentage of people watching

98
00:05:28.501 --> 00:05:32.160
her video went to my video right after. So then because of that,

99
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.790
they boosts in my video up next category of her video.

100
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.090
So then I didn't need to depend on the end cards anymore because I became the up

101
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.750
next video that also started happening with all her other videos.

102
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.010
So that is how I was growing at 30 subscribers a day. And then on January 1st,

103
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.850
if you remember, I was suddenly growing at a hundred subscribers a day.

104
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.090
Now you might think, Oh, maybe it's because of the start-up episode too,

105
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.650
but let's see what really happened. So if we break down videos,

106
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.750
the number one video getting the most views and growing fastest is still my,

107
00:06:01.751 --> 00:06:04.850
my Yukos interview. So how did it suddenly spike up? Well,

108
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.680
if you look at the traffic source of that video,

109
00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:10.220
you'll see that the initial spike came from suggested videos.

110
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.740
And if we dig into that, if we click suggested videos,

111
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.970
you see that when you co just released her get ready for 2018 video.

112
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.830
And then my interview happened to be the up next video. And then after that,

113
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.580
that's when YouTube start promoting that video to people's homepage.

114
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.740
So that's what the browse features are. Now,

115
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:31.490
let's talk about the one video that skyrocketed my channel,

116
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.570
the Dayna life video, that video was posted on December 24.

117
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.670
So how did it get so many views? All right,

118
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.800
let's look at the first bump from December 24 to December 26 for the first two

119
00:06:42.801 --> 00:06:43.071
days,

120
00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:47.600
it did really well with my subscribers and started promoting it on people's

121
00:06:47.601 --> 00:06:49.070
homepage. In addition,

122
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.840
I was able to get up to the up next video of another day in a light video

123
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.861
at that time,

124
00:06:54.861 --> 00:06:59.030
I already considered it as a successful video because in three days I

125
00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:02.510
accumulated 4,800 views. However, after that,

126
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.640
it blew up even more because YouTube decided to shove my video to everyone,

127
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.420
not even subscribed to me on the recommended videos. In addition to that,

128
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.420
my videos were getting suggested on other people's similar video.

129
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:19.040
And then that's how I got to 25,000 subscribers because that one video, Oh,

130
00:07:19.041 --> 00:07:23.240
and by the way, this video format, I just took it from what you go. Sorry,

131
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.270
once again, thanks for Yuko. Now onto the next section.

132
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.780
This section is actually the most important because I actually go through the

133
00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:31.610
concepts and how YouTube think about it.

134
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:35.763
<v 2>Hello.</v>

135
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:38.140
<v 0>Now, if you're a subscriber,</v>

136
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:42.880
you probably just see me as a engineer who had too much time on his hands and

137
00:07:42.881 --> 00:07:45.040
decided to make some fun videos for the internet.

138
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.140
But what really happened was an execution of a plan that I started back in

139
00:07:50.141 --> 00:07:53.710
August, 2017, even before I made my first video.

140
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:57.310
So let's get into it. I was still in New York at that time,

141
00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.170
and I saw a video on my recommended videos,

142
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.950
and that was my glucose day in the life video. Now I didn't watch it,

143
00:08:02.951 --> 00:08:06.760
but after a week I saw that the views increased by maybe 10 times.

144
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.410
And it was still in my recommended videos.

145
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.570
I looked at her channel and she had nothing else.

146
00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.840
So I knew I had to contact her. It was the perfect opportunity.

147
00:08:13.841 --> 00:08:16.240
She was still new, such that my email wouldn't get buried,

148
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.600
but she's also growing such that it's going to give mass results.

149
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.170
So while I was waiting for her to contact me back in parallel,

150
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:27.130
I knew that I had to make a whole new channel dedicated to tech because that's

151
00:08:27.131 --> 00:08:30.340
where she was in reason. Number one, I want them to UCO to agree,

152
00:08:30.341 --> 00:08:32.170
to collaborate with me. Reason. Number two,

153
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.360
when the viewers are coming from her channel,

154
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:37.750
the likelihood that they subscribe is higher. If it's a tech channel,

155
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.170
because it's relevant. I looked at all my skills and my competitive advantage,

156
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.010
and I realized that two of the best skills I have was one.

157
00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:48.250
I had a ridiculous amount of internship experience. And two,

158
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.510
I had filmmaking skills. Those were my two most valuable assets as a creator.

159
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:56.070
So I found my niche and I thought about two distinct one,

160
00:08:56.071 --> 00:08:59.130
the textual and one to start-up series an entertainment show.

161
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:00.990
Now this is another important concept.

162
00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:05.670
I want you guys to understand for a channel there's three main purposes for a

163
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.840
video, one reaching new audience to converting viewers,

164
00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:13.350
to subscribers and three, to engage your current subscribers,

165
00:09:13.351 --> 00:09:15.300
to increase their affinity with you. Now,

166
00:09:15.301 --> 00:09:17.700
the third one didn't really matter to me because I didn't even have any

167
00:09:17.701 --> 00:09:18.960
subscribers to begin with.

168
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.920
So the tech show was meant to give tips and tricks for people who want to work

169
00:09:22.921 --> 00:09:26.880
at Silicon Valley. As you can see, this is obviously for purpose, number one,

170
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.310
reaching a new audience, because when you're new,

171
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.930
you're not going to reach any audience.

172
00:09:30.931 --> 00:09:35.820
The only way you can get a new audience is being searchable and being relatable

173
00:09:35.821 --> 00:09:39.090
from other kinds of videos. So what are people searching for?

174
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.180
They're searching for how to get internships. And I have the knowledge for that.

175
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.470
So for my startup series,

176
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:47.190
these were to convert viewers into subscribers because there were a lot higher

177
00:09:47.191 --> 00:09:49.320
quality videos and there were entertaining.

178
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:53.370
So basically in some ways I reel them in with knowledge and I keep them with

179
00:09:53.371 --> 00:09:55.260
entertainment. So one month later,

180
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:59.250
my UCO finally contacted me and she agreed to meet. At this point.

181
00:09:59.251 --> 00:10:02.850
I didn't have any videos, but I sold her on a dream on creating a new wave,

182
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.340
a YouTube burst in tech fast forward a month.

183
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:09.540
That's when I made my two first videos and then just waited for the collap to

184
00:10:09.541 --> 00:10:09.960
come up.

185
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.790
And the reason for these two videos is that it increases the ratio of viewers to

186
00:10:14.791 --> 00:10:15.510
subscribers.

187
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.510
And the reason why is if you had an empty channel and you just had that

188
00:10:18.511 --> 00:10:21.060
collaboration, they don't know if you're going to keep posting videos.

189
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.270
So there's no reason for them to subscribe, but if you already have two videos,

190
00:10:24.271 --> 00:10:27.120
they know that you're serious and they know what value add to them.

191
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.870
So that will increase the likelihood for them to subscribe. All right,

192
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.070
now let's talk about why I decided to choose to make an interview as a

193
00:10:35.071 --> 00:10:38.580
collaboration with my UCO. But before that, there's a second concept.

194
00:10:38.581 --> 00:10:43.080
I want you to understand, and this is how do I get my videos to the up next?

195
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.470
So a rule of thumb on how to crack these algorithms,

196
00:10:46.471 --> 00:10:49.860
these YouTube algorithms is to put yourself in YouTube shoes.

197
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:51.420
Imagine if you run YouTube,

198
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:55.920
what would you like users to do or to behave on your platform? I mean,

199
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.750
I personally, if I own YouTube,

200
00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.720
I want people to spend as much time as they can on YouTube.

201
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.480
And one of the features is up next. So I asked myself,

202
00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:06.180
what kind of videos do I want to put their videos that are relevant?

203
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:09.000
So maybe they have the same tags or kind of similar titles,

204
00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.460
but I think we can do better than that. So once again,

205
00:11:11.461 --> 00:11:12.630
enough people watching this video,

206
00:11:12.631 --> 00:11:17.610
I want to know which videos are most likely to be watched right after this

207
00:11:17.611 --> 00:11:18.330
video.

208
00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:22.620
And that is how I will choose what videos to put on the up next section.

209
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.440
So back to the Manuka interview, why did I choose that video?

210
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:30.450
Because one thing I saw is that people who watch my Yukos video loved my Yuko.

211
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.940
People are very interested in her personally,

212
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.110
and she did not fill that void in her videos. So I made this video,

213
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:41.070
I completed the void. I made this interview, such daddy was personal.

214
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.180
And the reason why that,

215
00:11:42.181 --> 00:11:45.180
that is because I know that right after they watch a video about my UCO,

216
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:47.910
they want more. And then if my video can provide a day,

217
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.530
we'll click that video right after.

218
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.710
And that is how I got into the suggested videos for all of our videos.

219
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.550
So as you can see, I was very dependent on the up next category.

220
00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:02.560
But when I grew to 2000 subscribers, it was time to change plans.

221
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:07.150
And that is to get on the homepage on the recommended videos. So here we go.

222
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.280
This is the next concept I want to talk about.

223
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:13.510
How do you make YouTube promote your videos onto the homepage for your non

224
00:12:13.511 --> 00:12:17.620
subscribers? Once again, let's pretend we're YouTube again. And what do we want?

225
00:12:17.621 --> 00:12:20.830
We want to increase time spent on our website. What should we put?

226
00:12:20.831 --> 00:12:23.710
Should we put the most popular videos or the videos from your subscribers list?

227
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.070
I mean, those are good, but I think we can do better. And to talk about this,

228
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:30.550
I'm going to use a concept that product managers use often called the user

229
00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:33.700
funnel. So this is what the YouTube choose your funnel looks like.

230
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:38.380
So what does this user funnel have to do with getting onto the homepage? Well,

231
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:39.820
as a YouTube product manager,

232
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:44.860
I want as many users to reach the end of the funnel, which is to,

233
00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:47.950
you know, watch as many videos as possible or like binge watch videos.

234
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:49.840
So how do I optimize that? Well,

235
00:12:49.841 --> 00:12:54.160
every user has to start from the top and that is to click a video and to see how

236
00:12:54.161 --> 00:12:57.430
successful a video is, is to look at the CTR,

237
00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.200
AKA click through rate,

238
00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.720
which means how likely are they going to click that video?

239
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:04.390
So no matter how good your video is, if nobody clicks her video,

240
00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.070
you're not going to watch it. They're not going to see it.

241
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.280
So it doesn't even matter. So that's why we call it the top of the funnel.

242
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:13.150
Next bucket of the funnel is if they watch a video. So if your video is good,

243
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.330
you'll generally get a good watch time on your video.

244
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:20.650
So how does YouTube measure to the measure it by your average video watch time.

245
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.420
And then lastly, the last bucket,

246
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.290
the thing that we care most about is that they start binge watching videos.

247
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:28.060
So basically they want to answer a question.

248
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:32.860
Does your YouTube video increase the time span of the user on this

249
00:13:32.861 --> 00:13:37.420
website? And that could be measured by session time. We can't really see this,

250
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.090
but it means right when they click on your video,

251
00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.300
how long do they stay on YouTube? The higher that number,

252
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.560
the better it is because it means that your video was the catalyst of this

253
00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:48.760
binge-watching session.

254
00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.660
So what YouTube does is they will first take the people who are most likely

255
00:13:52.661 --> 00:13:56.410
going to watch your videos and show it to them. So most likely your subscribers,

256
00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:58.180
and then once it performs well for them,

257
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.940
it will show to people who are less likely going to watch it.

258
00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:03.400
And then they're going to see how it performs with them.

259
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:07.450
And then they're going to keep doing this until they realize your video has no

260
00:14:07.451 --> 00:14:08.860
more marshal benefit for them.

261
00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.410
So how do you make these videos that are promoted by YouTube?

262
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.630
So looking back at the funnel, you have the last part.

263
00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:16.870
And then how do you increase that last part boorish through erasers one,

264
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:20.110
you increase the CTR, your video, which means the click-through rate.

265
00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.300
So that means thumbnail and title.

266
00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.360
And then you want to have a good video that they finish watching,

267
00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.140
which means you want to make sure that you increase your audience retention.

268
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:31.160
And also your watch time artists retention.

269
00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:33.550
Retention's kind of tricky because it depends on how long the video is.

270
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:37.870
So just focus on having a average watch time that is high and that you can just

271
00:14:37.871 --> 00:14:40.270
do by having better videos or more engaging videos.

272
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.160
And the third one increasing session time,

273
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:45.220
that is a little bit harder because you're not really in control of what they're

274
00:14:45.221 --> 00:14:46.054
going to watch next.

275
00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.390
But if you have a lot of good videos and recommended on your own videos,

276
00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.320
then they could start binge watching your video.

277
00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:54.740
So you could single handle it increased session time. All right, finally,

278
00:14:54.741 --> 00:14:58.280
let's wrap it up. So how do you turn those views into subscribers now?

279
00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.170
And the reason why subscribers are important,

280
00:15:00.171 --> 00:15:02.930
because they're the ones that are going to see your videos first,

281
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.920
and they're going to be the judge of them and YouTube are going to take signals

282
00:15:06.921 --> 00:15:11.360
from them to decide if they should promote your video more or not are for the

283
00:15:11.361 --> 00:15:14.660
things I'm going to talk about. Next, I'm going to use another user funnel,

284
00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:19.040
but this time it's not YouTube user funnel. It's my user funnel, my channels,

285
00:15:19.041 --> 00:15:23.120
user funnel. So as you can see, the end of the funnel is not subscribers.

286
00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.180
The end of funnel is actually engaged users.

287
00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.400
We usually talk about getting more and more subscribers,

288
00:15:28.401 --> 00:15:31.760
but I don't believe that numbers represent everything because I see a lot of

289
00:15:31.761 --> 00:15:33.290
people with a hundred thousand subscribers,

290
00:15:33.291 --> 00:15:36.200
but only getting maybe 1000 views for each video.

291
00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:40.220
And I also see good accounts that have a hundred thousand subscribers,

292
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:44.210
but they're getting 50,000 views per video. So there's a big difference there.

293
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:48.410
So this is why I think the bottom of the funnel should be engaged users,

294
00:15:48.411 --> 00:15:50.540
but there are a lot of different proxies to kind of measure that.

295
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:54.350
One way I measure it is I look at when I post a new video,

296
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:58.310
how many views do I get into first 24 hours that are from my subscribers?

297
00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.670
So those are the most engaged users that have, there are other proxies,

298
00:16:01.671 --> 00:16:04.700
like how many people are in your live streams or how many people start following

299
00:16:04.701 --> 00:16:07.790
you on Instagram. Those are your engaged users. All right.

300
00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:11.810
So now I'm going to talk about my channel strategy and how I use the user funnel

301
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.880
to decide on what videos I make.

302
00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:17.000
So obviously it's best to increase the top of the user funnel,

303
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:20.810
because if you increase 10% of the top of the funnel, then it's the biggest pie.

304
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.230
So at the end, you're going to increase 10% of engaged users.

305
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.980
So top of the funnel, we got to increase CTR. Now, how do we do that?

306
00:16:27.981 --> 00:16:32.420
We want to get good thumbnails and good titles and for people to have reasons to

307
00:16:32.421 --> 00:16:33.230
watch your video.

308
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:37.670
So this is why I make videos like how I got an internship day in the life videos

309
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:41.360
and all of those click baity videos, my startup series, um,

310
00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.190
the ones I put the most effort in,

311
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:47.300
they actually don't do that round CTR because they have no context to what it's

312
00:16:47.301 --> 00:16:50.870
about, but this series serve another purpose, which I'll explain later.

313
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:54.680
So the problem of increasing to top of your funnel is that YouTube does not give

314
00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:58.850
you CTR metrics. So that's a little bit hard to see if you're doing well or not,

315
00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:01.160
but there are things that can give you indication. For example,

316
00:17:01.161 --> 00:17:03.830
my video a day in the life of a Facebook engineer,

317
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.260
obviously I put Facebook there for clickbait.

318
00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:09.650
I was getting a lot more views on the first day compared to my other videos.

319
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:13.310
So I would guess that people are clicking more often because once you publish a

320
00:17:13.311 --> 00:17:16.400
video, YouTube does not know, uh, who's interested in it.

321
00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:20.210
So they will probably send it to the same amount of people as previously.

322
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.940
All right. So let's say once they click the video,

323
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.080
probably 75% of them actually watches more than 10 seconds of it. Uh,

324
00:17:27.081 --> 00:17:30.650
you can look at this, uh, using audience retention on your videos. All right.

325
00:17:30.651 --> 00:17:34.400
So another concept I need to bring in is about benchmarking and that's just a

326
00:17:34.401 --> 00:17:38.600
fancy word to say, comparing yourselves to other people and see how you fall.

327
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:39.830
So I would like to do,

328
00:17:39.831 --> 00:17:43.400
is I look at my other videos and also my friend's videos to see what kind of

329
00:17:43.401 --> 00:17:46.610
metrics to get. And then depending on the metrics that they have,

330
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:49.070
it gives me an indication to think about, Oh,

331
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:53.400
is this even possible to move like this metric? So back to the 75%,

332
00:17:53.401 --> 00:17:57.360
I think that's pretty hard to improve because I've looked at every other channel

333
00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.300
and not a lot of them got more than 75%.

334
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.690
So I'd say once they've reached a 10 seconds of the video,

335
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.840
maybe 60% of them,

336
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:10.890
or 50% of them actually finish your video, depending on how long your video is.

337
00:18:10.891 --> 00:18:14.190
Of course, I wouldn't worry too much about how many people finish your video,

338
00:18:14.191 --> 00:18:17.130
but I would worry about your average watch time on your video.

339
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:21.300
That's important because YouTube would probably be using that as a signal to see

340
00:18:21.301 --> 00:18:24.270
how high quality your video is and we'll boost it accordingly.

341
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.760
So to increase that that's just about content quality.

342
00:18:26.761 --> 00:18:28.980
So I can't really help you out there. All right.

343
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:32.880
So next part of the funnel is having your viewers watch more videos or visit

344
00:18:32.881 --> 00:18:36.660
your channel. So this is just, you know, if you have good videos,

345
00:18:36.661 --> 00:18:37.710
they will watch more of it.

346
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:42.450
And a way to measure that is by looking at your suggest videos on your analytics

347
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:46.590
to see if you get a lot of traffic coming from your own videos, if you do,

348
00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:49.620
it means that a lot of people are coming from your videos and then they want to

349
00:18:49.621 --> 00:18:51.600
watch more and are binge watching your videos.

350
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.450
Now finally getting them to subscribe.

351
00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:58.110
So my current strategy is to reel them in with knowledge,

352
00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.150
like how to get internships and stuff like that,

353
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:03.330
and make them stay for the entertainment, which is my startup series.

354
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:07.350
Even if you have one viral video, if your channel is not high quality and has,

355
00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:10.440
or has nothing to do with the viral video, people will not subscribe.

356
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.730
Make sure people have a good idea on what they're subscribing to on what your

357
00:19:14.731 --> 00:19:15.600
channel is about.

358
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.540
So how do you know if you're doing well in converting them to subscribers?

359
00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:23.880
You have to look at your ratio of new subscribers divided by number

360
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.040
of unconnected views, unconnected,

361
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.980
meaning non-subscribers that ratio tells you,

362
00:19:28.981 --> 00:19:32.550
what is the percentage of people watching your video that decide to subscribe.

363
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:33.540
Once again,

364
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:38.220
you should benchmark look at other YouTubers account and see what their

365
00:19:38.221 --> 00:19:39.090
percentages,

366
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.320
this is not going to be a perfect approximation because what you're looking at

367
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:46.680
is their daily subscribers divided by daily amount of views.

368
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:49.080
So you can't really get their non-subscriber views.

369
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.940
So how you do this as you go on social blade,

370
00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:55.020
you type in account that you want to compare yourselves to usually compare

371
00:19:55.021 --> 00:19:59.400
yourself with someone, with a similar subscriber account and also similar topic.

372
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:02.220
And then what you do is you look at how many views they have,

373
00:20:02.221 --> 00:20:05.460
and you look at how many subscribers they have on a daily average.

374
00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:07.560
And then you divide those two and you see the percentage.

375
00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.220
Usually I think 5% is a really good one. Now it's not over yet.

376
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.640
I want to make sure that my subscribers don't get bored of me.

377
00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:19.590
And that is where consistency comes in. And I care about engaged users,

378
00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:20.550
not just subscribers.

379
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:25.350
Some people subscribe to over 50 plus channels and they don't actively watch all

380
00:20:25.351 --> 00:20:29.070
of them. They might watch maybe, you know, at max 10 of them actively.

381
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:32.850
So you have to work really hard to be their favorite YouTuber.

382
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.800
The way you do that is by being consistent.

383
00:20:34.801 --> 00:20:38.160
And you upload often that way you don't become irrelevant.

384
00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:42.090
And I live stream a lot because I can't post every day,

385
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.940
but I can live stream pretty much almost every day.

386
00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.650
And then that's how I keep my subscribers engaged. All right.

387
00:20:47.651 --> 00:20:50.920
So that was super long and I hope that was useful and that some of these

388
00:20:50.921 --> 00:20:52.300
concepts will stick to you.

389
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.930
And I think those are good frameworks to think about how to make videos and how

390
00:20:55.931 --> 00:20:56.920
to grow your channel.

391
00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.580
But if there's only one thing I want you guys to leave with is remembered that

392
00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:04.000
if you have an opportunity or if there's an opportunity that rises,

393
00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.510
you better take it. And then once you take it, you should double down on it.

394
00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:11.590
So this can be in a form of a collaboration or of a viral video.

395
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.770
Make sure you just do that thing again.

396
00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:19.690
So I hope you enjoyed this data science approach to growing a YouTube channel.

397
00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:21.790
I actually have a lot of other tips and tricks,

398
00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:25.000
but this video is already way too long.

399
00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.780
So I'm going to keep that for maybe another time. All right. Good luck.

400
00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:29.980
And thanks for watching.
