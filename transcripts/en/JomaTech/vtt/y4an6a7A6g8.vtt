00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.610
<v 0>Yo what's up. Welcome to my apartment again.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.760
So today we don't have Matt show cause matcha is feeling kind of sick.

3
00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:08.820
So we got this replacement guy, but I know he's, you're hungry.

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.350
I don't think I have much because my roommates are not here, but Oh my God,

5
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:17.730
what the great courses, plus I did not expect you that. Oh,

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.300
so today we are sponsored by the great courses plus,

7
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:23.220
which is a video learning service.

8
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.280
We are going to talk about this at the end of the video,

9
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.280
but for now let's talk about something more important in my room.

10
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.853
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

11
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.891
<v 0>All right.</v>

12
00:00:48.891 --> 00:00:53.780
So the thing I want to talk about today is about self-improvement and

13
00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:55.130
also personal development.

14
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.970
And the reason why I want to talk about this is because it's something that

15
00:00:58.971 --> 00:01:02.600
affected me at work and it's something that I overcame,

16
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.750
or at least I'm trying to overcome. So in my opinion,

17
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.370
the number one blocker for most people to reach their maximum potential

18
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.820
is their ego. And that was especially true for me.

19
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.730
And I recognized it in college and also at work,

20
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.630
it's still something that I'm working on. For example, in college,

21
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.640
my number one blocker was that I was too scared of taking advanced

22
00:01:25.641 --> 00:01:30.140
courses or too scared of partaking in competitions because I was

23
00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:33.890
scared of failing because I had a sensitive ego.

24
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.510
And then at work, I did not ask for feedback that much.

25
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.010
And the reason why is because negative criticism hurt me.

26
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.960
I think the reason why I have this ego problem is

27
00:01:47.961 --> 00:01:52.820
because I never really failed in life when I was a kid. Um,

28
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.560
I think this is also true for most people with this fixed mindset.

29
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.290
So a lot of these people I've recognized them through classmates and coworkers,

30
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.130
that when they were small in elementary school, high school,

31
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.420
they were always the smartest, getting good grades came easy to them.

32
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.220
So it was never a problem for them.

33
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.960
So failing was almost a foreign concept to them, but then once they hit it,

34
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.620
once they had their first failure, it hurts. It hurts a lot.

35
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.980
And what happens when things hurt a lot, you don't do anymore.

36
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.930
You shelter yourself. And then this failure usually bruises their ego.

37
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.440
And because their ego is bruise, they don't want to do it anymore.

38
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.000
They rather not take any risks and do things that are a lot easier so that they

39
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:40.580
can feel comfortable to prevent another failure.

40
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.330
And then feedback in some ways is a form of failure,

41
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.610
or at least it evokes the same emotion because essentially what you're doing is

42
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.480
you're letting yourself be vulnerable because you're letting people say negative

43
00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:58.160
criticism about your work or about you in general. And that is a scary thing.

44
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.410
And I still, I'm still, I'm S I'm still struggling with that,

45
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.450
but I'm working on it.

46
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.820
And the feedback has been great because the work that I've done before getting

47
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:13.480
feedback and the work that I've done after my feedback is day and night.

48
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.500
It's so clear that after getting feedback, my work is so much better.

49
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.740
I communicate better. My analysis is more rigorous.

50
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.400
Everything is just a lot better because I asked for feedback and he,

51
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:27.040
so I hope that was useful. Uh, in conclusion,

52
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.110
the only thing I want you to remember is to ask for feedback and be

53
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:34.840
ego-less all right. So like I said before,

54
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:36.880
this video is sponsored by the great courses plus,

55
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.650
and because this video is sponsored,

56
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.670
I can afford to buy Metro and the iPhone 10. So he doesn't know it yet.

57
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.480
And unfortunately he's a little bit too sick to come over.

58
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.010
So what I did was I hit the iPhone 10 inside the box of a stabilizer,

59
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.310
which he owns and it's at his house right now. So yeah,

60
00:03:54.311 --> 00:03:57.010
I just wanted to buy him an iPhone 10 because, uh,

61
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.920
I just want to thank him for all the work that he has done for me.

62
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.320
And he definitely deserves it. So yeah, this let's, uh, let's call him up. Yo,

63
00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:10.000
Matt. Hello? Yo, what's up, man?

64
00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:14.740
How you doing? I hope you're feeling better. Yeah.

65
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.940
Cool. You, uh, I want you to do something for me.

66
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.780
Uh, you know, that crane that you have go,

67
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:26.860
can you go to it first?

68
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.800
<v 2>Yeah, yeah. Uh, next to it.</v>

69
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.040
<v 0>All right. Open it and dig deep inside.</v>

70
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.870
<v 2>Oh. There's an iPhone 10 in here.</v>

71
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.390
<v 0>It's yours.</v>

72
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.790
<v 2>Boy. It's yours serious.</v>

73
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.910
<v 0>Yo, you had like a crappy iPhone six. I think.</v>

74
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.310
I think I want you to have this iPhone 10.

75
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.490
<v 2>Oh my gosh. You like it? Yeah.</v>

76
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.290
Yeah. Thanks man.

77
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.110
<v 0>You'll no problem, man. But, uh, yeah.</v>

78
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.540
Can you redo that with more enthusiasm for the video?

79
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.440
No, but yeah. I'm glad you like it. I just wanted to say, yeah,

80
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.130
thank you for all the hard work that you've done for me. And uh, yeah.

81
00:05:20.131 --> 00:05:23.790
I just really appreciate you and I hope this gift.

play chess or become a better photographer.

95
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.660
I actually binge watched a course called Saifai science fiction and philosophy.

96
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.400
The course is cool because it takes a Poplar Saifai movie and it relates to a

97
00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:22.160
philosophical topic that the movie touched upon.

98
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.420
So I got to learn the deeper meanings of the movies, like the matrix star Wars,

99
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.850
and many more. I was able to hook you guys up.
