00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>It's not all that happens though,</v>

2
00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:05.040
when they eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,

3
00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:08.280
because it's not called the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of nakedness.

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.370
It's called the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

5
00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:14.100
And I thought about that for a tremendous amount of time.

6
00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:18.720
It's like what in the world, because I assume these old stories make sense.

7
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.660
You know, it's a game I play. It's like, they're old,

8
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.360
they've been around a long time. I'm not sure why they're there.

9
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.670
<v 1>There, but there they are. They're at the basis of our culture.</v>

10
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.750
<v 0>Many, many of the stories that we depend on depend on them,</v>

11
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.620
our whole culture grew out of their roots, let's say.

12
00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:41.210
And so I assume that our ancestors who've managed to survive conditions that

13
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.430
would have done a lot of us in very rapidly.

14
00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:46.430
I can tell you we're a lot smarter than we think,

15
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.920
and that the mysterious processes that,

16
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.720
that produced these stories and compelled us to remember them are a lot more

17
00:00:53.721 --> 00:00:56.810
psychologically significant than we generally tend to presume.

18
00:00:56.811 --> 00:01:01.070
So I give them the benefit of the doubt and try to understand why it is that

19
00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:05.660
they might make sense instead of assuming that they don't and that that's not

20
00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:08.510
easy as they're complicated stories.

21
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.700
And so I thought about this nakedness knowledge of good and evil idea for a

22
00:01:13.701 --> 00:01:16.700
very, very long time, like about 20 years,

23
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.050
puzzling it out was what the hell is the relationship between discovering that

24
00:01:21.051 --> 00:01:24.140
you're naked and discovering good and evil.

25
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.370
And then one day mostly because of studying totalitarianism,

26
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.290
totalitarianism and the atrocity that proclivity for people to commit

27
00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:36.710
atrocity in the service of their group belief,

28
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.030
or maybe just because that's what they were like clued me in.

29
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.350
And I thought,

30
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.640
I see this is one of the things that really makes people different than animals.

31
00:01:46.641 --> 00:01:47.990
It's like, you know,

32
00:01:47.991 --> 00:01:51.650
it's one thing to realize that you're naked to realize that you're naked means

33
00:01:51.651 --> 00:01:52.221
that you know,

34
00:01:52.221 --> 00:01:56.240
that you're limited in time and space that you're mortal and that you're,

35
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.190
you're subject to degeneration and to social humiliation and to your own harsh

36
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.940
judgment,

37
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.680
all of that nakedness to know that you're vulnerable against the

38
00:02:06.681 --> 00:02:07.310
world.

39
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.950
And definitely a source of shame because of that and

40
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.620
felt lack of self-sufficiency and no wonder,

41
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.140
no wonder it's understandable.

42
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.880
But the other thing is is that this is, and this is the rub it's like,

43
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.220
if you're out in the Velt and you're not being very careful and a hungry lion

44
00:02:28.221 --> 00:02:33.200
jumps on you and eats you, you don't really think of the lion as evil. I mean,

45
00:02:33.201 --> 00:02:37.670
you might right at that moment, but you know, philosophically,

46
00:02:37.671 --> 00:02:41.270
it's not evil, it's just hungry. And as soon as it's not hungry,

47
00:02:41.271 --> 00:02:43.880
then it goes and has asleep.

48
00:02:43.881 --> 00:02:48.290
And it's not up to some malevolent trick it's it's done for the day,

49
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.250
but human being that's a whole different sort of creature.

50
00:02:52.251 --> 00:02:57.140
And because human being is capable of doing terrible things to someone else

51
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.070
and consciously, so you think, well,

52
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:04.090
what's the connection between that and nakedness itself. And it seems to be,

53
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:04.924
this is like,

54
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.510
here's the thing is that once I realized that I can be hurt, you know,

55
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.110
I have a self-conscious model of my own vulnerability,

56
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.270
then I can generalize that to other people I can think, Oh, this is interesting.

57
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.950
Here's how I can be heard by myself. Here's how I can be hurt by society.

58
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.370
Here's how I can be hurt by nature and by the unknown.

59
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.680
And what that implies is that, well,

60
00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:33.520
you can be hurt with exactly the same mechanisms

61
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.080
and that immediately becomes part of my,

62
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.040
what would you say? My repertoire of ability?

63
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.770
And then all of a sudden the world is no, uh, Wald

64
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.790
walled garden and a well-watered place,

65
00:03:50.791 --> 00:03:54.780
but it's a moral story because with that ability to

66
00:03:54.781 --> 00:03:59.760
inflict suffering comes the knowledge of good and evil.

67
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.200
As far as I'm concerned,

68
00:04:01.201 --> 00:04:05.190
those are identical propositions because now we have the choice,

69
00:04:05.191 --> 00:04:08.430
a deep choice about how we're going to treat ourselves in each other.

70
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.290
We can inflict tremendous pain and suffering on each other in a

71
00:04:13.291 --> 00:04:15.810
very voluntary and,

72
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.240
and conscious manner in, in, in a way that no other animal can manage.

73
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.310
And that's the dawning of the moral sense that

74
00:04:26.311 --> 00:04:30.300
capacity we now have to choose to

75
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.760
mitigate or exaggerate suffering. And that's not all,

76
00:04:35.761 --> 00:04:36.630
but it's a huge part.
