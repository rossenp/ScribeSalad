00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.620
<v 0>You know, people have like three, well, they have four fundamental fears.</v>

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.480
One is fear of their own inadequacy and malevolence.

3
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.310
That's, that's a big fear, man, that can really, that can really do you in,

4
00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:18.750
if you confront it accidentally and fully

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.330
happens to soldiers sometimes in battle,

6
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.690
when they find themselves doing things they can't believe they do.

7
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.400
And then we're afraid of society. That would be the oppressive patriarchy,

8
00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:33.240
because society judges us harshly and

9
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.430
mercilessly in many ways.

10
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.900
And we don't like to plummet in the,

11
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.460
what would you call it?

12
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.520
We don't like to see our reputation savaged in front of the groups that

13
00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:48.540
we identify with.

14
00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:52.710
It's extraordinarily hard on us emotionally for that to happen,

15
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.740
which I wrote about, for example, in rule one,

16
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.030
which is a chapter, at least in part the details,

17
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.190
the fact that the neurochemical systems that track your comparative

18
00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:09.900
status in competence hierarchies also regulate the balance

19
00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:12.000
between your positive and negative emotion,

20
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.940
such that if you suffer a social defeat,

21
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.060
your proclivity to experience negative emotion,

22
00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:22.320
radically increases and your proclivity to experience positive emotion,

23
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.150
radically decreases and people seriously do not like that.

24
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.800
And it's no wonder because who wants to be completely overwhelmed with

25
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:35.730
sadness and bitterness and anxiety and resentment and disappointment and

26
00:01:35.731 --> 00:01:40.590
frustration and grief. And then also devoid of happiness. You know,

27
00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:42.360
it's the very definition of hell.

28
00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:46.500
And if a status defeat will increase that probability,

29
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.460
then we will fight very hard to maintain our status positions,

30
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.980
which we certainly do. That's another fear.

31
00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:57.780
And then of course we have the fear of nature and we should, because of course,

32
00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.733
nature,

33
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.870
despite being the environment and this thing that we should be striving

34
00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:08.280
to protect and maintain is also trying with all of its might

35
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.260
constantly to make us ill and old and kill us

36
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.280
and is generally very successful at all three.

37
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.260
And so there's every reason to be afraid of nature. And, um,

38
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.960
you know, one night alone in the Bush will pretty much convince you of that.

39
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.560
And then people are also afraid of the unknown.

40
00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:36.540
And so those are the big categories of terror that human beings face and

41
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.550
to be naked on stage is to face at least two or three of those

42
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.050
simultaneously.
