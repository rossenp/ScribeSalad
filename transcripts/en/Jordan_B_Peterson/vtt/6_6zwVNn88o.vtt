00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.023
<v 0>Hi everyone.</v>

2
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.460
<v 1>As some of you may know, but others will not.</v>

3
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.830
It's been a long while since I put up any new content on this YouTube channel,

4
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.300
I've been suffering from impaired health,

5
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.070
severely impaired health,

6
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.530
as a consequence of benzodiazepine use for

7
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.480
anxiety or more accurately from a combination of using that

8
00:00:29.481 --> 00:00:32.810
medication and then ceasing its use.

9
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.260
Once I realized it was dangerous, um,

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.950
that's put me in and out of hospitals for much of the last year

11
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.990
in Connecticut, in the United States, in Toronto,

12
00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:51.470
in Canada, in Moscow, in Russia,

13
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.690
and in Belgrade Serbia.

14
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.213
<v 0>As.</v>

15
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.430
<v 1>My family searched for specialists who could aid me in this severe</v>

16
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.560
post use withdrawal and neurological damage

17
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.240
related consequences of both the benzodiazepine use and,

18
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.180
and its cessation. Um,

19
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.710
I started taking it in 2016, 2017,

20
00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:22.820
early 2017, according to the prescribed,

21
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.853
um,

22
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.960
recommendations and really never give it a second thought. Uh,

23
00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:33.290
that was a mistake, um, to say the least.

24
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.183
<v 0>Anyways.</v>

25
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.830
<v 1>I've learned some things during that trying time, I suppose, or at least I've,</v>

26
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.620
I can tell you what kept me going during what was certainly the

27
00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:51.230
worst period of my life. Um,

28
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.010
family that's for sure. Uh,

29
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.700
friends and the work I was able to continue doing.

30
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.370
So I was able to continue writing, um,

31
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.800
something that all talk about probably within the next month,

32
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.320
my family, my wife, Tammy, my son,

33
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.010
Julian, and his wife Chilean, and my daughter McKayla and her husband,

34
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.020
Andre have been of inestimable value to me and provided me with tremendous

35
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:23.330
support during this period. Um,

36
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.460
McKayla and Andre accompanied me to Russia and to Serbia.

37
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.530
Uh, both of those episodes were extremely grueling and lasted for months.

38
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.963
Um,

39
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.220
but I'm alive and I have plans for the future.

40
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.520
I want to thank those people from the bottom of my heart,

41
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.050
my extended family and friends, whom I will name elsewhere,

42
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.560
went above and beyond the call of duty. In my estimation,

43
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.360
I certainly not convinced that I would have the character to provide to

44
00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.480
any one of them, what they provided to me. So was a humbling lesson,

45
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.530
I suppose. Um, my work,

46
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.570
this sort of work,

47
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:12.160
although it was all writing and not video production was also extremely useful

48
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:17.050
because I could sustain myself by producing

49
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:20.200
and then calling through thoughts that were helpful,

50
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:23.320
despite my anguish, I suppose,

51
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.460
and my lack of hope for the future. Um,

52
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.730
hopefully we'll see,

53
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.950
but hopefully much of that is behind me and I can return

54
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.530
to something resembling a normal life.

55
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.840
I can tell you what my plans are for video production,

56
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:48.550
at least for the next while I completed a

57
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:52.870
biblical series devoted to Genesis in fall of

58
00:03:52.871 --> 00:03:56.800
2017. And that has proved very popular.

59
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.360
I it's a strange word to use for a lecture series like that. Um,

60
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.090
I'm going to start working on the next book in the old Testament,

61
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:10.630
which is Exodus, but in that will take awhile. But in the interim,

62
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.970
I think I'm going to produce videos devoted to Proverbs the book of wisdom

63
00:04:15.971 --> 00:04:20.560
essentially, or a book of wisdom. Um, you've all heard,

64
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:22.780
no doubt that wisdom is proverbial is that,

65
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:26.230
or that there's such a thing as proverbial wisdom. And that

66
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.560
phrase stems from the book of Proverbs,

67
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.490
which are single sentence aphorisms

68
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.820
imparting some truth.

69
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.190
I think the analysis of those which can be done in a relatively short period

70
00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:49.840
of time will prove of benefit to me and perhaps to those who are

71
00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:54.760
inclined to watch or listen to my analysis. Um,

72
00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.130
I would also like to thank all of you for

73
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.330
continuing to support my work.

74
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.120
I have far more followers on YouTube and Instagram and Twitter

75
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.890
for that matter than I did before I became ill.

76
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.420
And my book has sold very well in, in multiple languages.

77
00:05:19.421 --> 00:05:22.120
And that's really amazing and remarkable. And.

78
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.860
<v 0>I hope that.</v>

79
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.150
<v 1>What I produce in the future will</v>

80
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.230
That people will find it of equal or greater

81
00:05:37.231 --> 00:05:41.850
utility. That's an ambitious hope given how much attention,

82
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.490
what I've produced before has garnered, but.

83
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140
<v 0>It.</v>

84
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.690
<v 1>Still seems appropriate and appropriate goal for my upcoming</v>

85
00:05:51.691 --> 00:05:52.530
activities.

86
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.090
I guess I could let you all know as well that.

87
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.100
<v 0>We've put.</v>

88
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.020
<v 1>Together. This is an initiative that was spearheaded by McKayla and Andre.</v>

89
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.530
We've put together the ability to translate the YouTube lectures into

90
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.770
a variety of languages. I think it's six at the moment.

91
00:06:14.771 --> 00:06:16.960
Six will be ruled out over the next few months,

92
00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.060
professionally translated dubbed because our analysis

93
00:06:22.061 --> 00:06:24.100
indicated that in most of these markets,

94
00:06:24.101 --> 00:06:27.070
dubbed videos are preferred to subtitle videos.

95
00:06:27.071 --> 00:06:31.750
And so that will provide the opportunity

96
00:06:31.751 --> 00:06:36.220
for the ideas I've been developing. Um,

97
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.020
many of which I have derived from other sources to be sure.

98
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:43.323
<v 0>To.</v>

99
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.640
<v 1>Have an impact beyond the English language speaking world.</v>

100
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:54.010
Uh, there seems to be some desire for that.

101
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.100
Um, my book, my last book,

102
00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.210
12 rules for life sold 300,000 copies in

103
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.920
South Korea, for example,

104
00:07:02.921 --> 00:07:07.810
which very much surprised me because I wasn't sure that the ideas well

105
00:07:07.811 --> 00:07:10.360
first were translatable, but we're going to be.

106
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:13.773
<v 0>Acceptable.</v>

107
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.790
<v 1>Uh, in a culture with such a different developmental background.</v>

108
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.090
Anyways, I'm not going to make this a long video.

109
00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:27.370
I wanted to tell you that I'm back in Toronto, that I'm in much better health,

110
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.810
although it's still severely impaired, especially in the morning. Um,

111
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:35.740
but I can work again and I really want to, um,

112
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:41.650
and that to let you know that with God's grace and

113
00:07:41.651 --> 00:07:43.270
mercy, um,

114
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:48.580
I'll be able to start generating original

115
00:07:48.581 --> 00:07:52.900
material once again and pick up where I left off.

116
00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.240
Um, thank you very much.

117
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:56.463
<v 0>And.</v>

118
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.570
<v 1>Well, thank you very much. It's probably sufficient.</v>

119
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:03.400
<v 0>Bye-bye.</v>
