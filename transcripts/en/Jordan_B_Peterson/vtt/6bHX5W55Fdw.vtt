00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.350
<v 0>The next story,</v>

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.210
one of Cain and Abel and a play is on that because in a very interesting way,

3
00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:10.230
because it indicates what happens. And I would say it,

4
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.720
it supports my general hypothesis about what the first story

5
00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:19.830
means, because what happens with Cain and Abel is that well they're brothers,

6
00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:20.664
right?

7
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.870
And so hypothetically the first two real human beings,

8
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.000
and they don't really like each other.

9
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.330
Abel is a good guy by all appearances,

10
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.740
God smiles on him. Fate smiles on them. How about if we put it that way?

11
00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:39.390
Everything that he does seems to work out well, he makes sacrifices,

12
00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:44.190
which the texts insists upon and the sacrifices are rewarded by

13
00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:47.850
God. And it's a very, very, very, very important,

14
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.260
crucial document because we already noted that

15
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.030
men and women had discovered time in Genesis.

16
00:00:57.031 --> 00:01:00.810
They discovered the duration of their life and the existence of death and the

17
00:01:00.811 --> 00:01:02.220
necessity for toil.

18
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.960
And by the time we get to Cain and Abel human beings have discovered in this

19
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:11.310
dramatic manner that if they make sacrifices in the present that

20
00:01:11.311 --> 00:01:15.510
hypothetically the future can be better. And that's, that's like,

21
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.110
I don't know if that's not the major discovery of mankind.

22
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.070
It's certainly among the top one or two, because it's very,

23
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.990
it's really something for a creature,

24
00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:29.790
for an animal like us to notice that if we give up something that we

25
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:31.080
want right now,

26
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.880
we can sort of bargain with fate as it were to get something better in the

27
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:38.910
future. And that's really what you do when you work, right?

28
00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:41.010
Because when you work by definition,

29
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:43.710
you're doing things that you'd rather not do right now,

30
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.630
because otherwise it wouldn't be work.

31
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.850
And the reason that you're doing that is because you think, well,

32
00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:51.450
if I give up what I really want to do impulsively right now,

33
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.040
then over the medium to long term, things will be better. And so you learn,

34
00:01:56.041 --> 00:02:00.990
you believe that making the appropriate sacrifices has the propitiate.

35
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.490
God let's say metaphorically and Abel's

36
00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:07.440
sacrifices work, man. Everything.

37
00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:10.770
He touches turns to sheep and camels and women,

38
00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:15.000
and he has everything he wants and everyone likes him and everybody thinks he's

39
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:19.680
a good guy. And you know, that's pretty good for Abel, but Kane,

40
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.770
isn't doing so well. And nothing.

41
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:27.060
He sacrifices appears to have the proper effect.

42
00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:31.680
And there is some idea in this story that maybe the sacrifices he makes

43
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.220
are a little bit on the half-hearted side and that God,

44
00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:40.020
isn't all that thrilled at those sacrifices as a consequence. And that's really,

45
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.540
we're thinking about again for about 50 years,

46
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.520
because it is possible that if you're making sacrifices and they're not

47
00:02:47.521 --> 00:02:49.050
working out that well,

48
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.000
that it's not so much that God hates you it's that your sacrifices could

49
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:57.000
be of a somewhat higher quality, right?

50
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.120
That you're playing a game with yourself and with the structure of reality,

51
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.870
and you think you can get away with it and you can't.

52
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.800
And the fact that you're not getting away with it and that you can't makes you

53
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:13.000
bitter and resentful and cruel and vengeful and homicidal

54
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.070
eventually and worse than that,

55
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:17.500
because there are far worse places than you can go,

56
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.890
that you can go than merely homicidal. Anyways,

57
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.730
Cain has enough of this one day and he says to,

58
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.440
he Kade decides to have a chat with God. And it goes something like this,

59
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.440
it's quite a, an arrogant chat. Really.

60
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.700
It's almost as arrogant as Adams was stupid.

61
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.900
And Kane basically challenges God. He says, look,

62
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.050
I don't know what sort of world you think you put together here,

63
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.760
but we've got Abel and we've got me. And like,

64
00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:51.430
everything's just working out for him. And you know,

65
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.310
he's perfectly delightful,

66
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.230
and everyone likes him and whatever he touches like King Midas

67
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.500
turns to gold and it's all easy for him.

68
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.870
And then there's me.

69
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.550
And I'm like breaking myself in half here and I'm offering up my sacrifices.

70
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.500
And like you turn your nose up at them.

71
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:16.030
And nothing works out for me and implying by the way that it's God's

72
00:04:16.031 --> 00:04:18.850
fault. I would say more than implying,

73
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.290
stating quite forthrightly that it's God's.

74
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.510
<v 1>Fault, which, you know, takes.</v>

75
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.380
<v 0>A certain degree of arrogance. You might think. And that's also,</v>

76
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:31.720
we're thinking about for a very long period of time,

77
00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:36.190
because it is possible that if things are going well for someone that you know,

78
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.590
and not going so well for you,

79
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.550
that it is a consequence of the quality of your sacrifices.

80
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.390
And I don't want to push that too far because I know that people have bad luck,

81
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.700
you know, cause we are fragile creatures,

82
00:04:48.701 --> 00:04:53.530
intrinsically and terrible things can happen to us on a somewhat random basis,

83
00:04:53.531 --> 00:04:58.450
but it's still very much worth considering. That's the rule in chapter six,

84
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.160
put your house in order before you criticize the world,

85
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.440
that the reason that things aren't turning out for you as well as they might

86
00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:13.090
is because your sacrifices just don't have enough

87
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.510
blood in them. They're just not what they should be.

88
00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:20.020
You're not putting your full heart into it. And as a consequence,

89
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.560
you're not reaping the fee.

90
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.950
You're not reaping the crop that you might otherwise. So,

91
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.150
and that's a harsh thing to think, but that's actually what God tells Cain,

92
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.980
which is quite interesting.

93
00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:36.400
I read a lot of different translations trying to understand this and what God

94
00:05:36.401 --> 00:05:37.420
basically says is.

95
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.600
<v 1>Look, buddy, um.</v>

96
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.320
<v 0>Before you dare to criticize the creator of the</v>

97
00:05:49.321 --> 00:05:52.350
world or reality itself, for that matter,

98
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.490
you might give some thought to your own actions. And here's how I look at it,

99
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.000
be in God and all you're in a house and there's a doorway and in the

100
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:02.451
doorway,

101
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:07.310
there's a predatory cat and it's sexually aroused and

102
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:10.970
it's after you and you invite it in

103
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.440
voluntarily and you let it have its way with you.

104
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.980
And something's produced as a consequence of that. That's well,

105
00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:26.660
you might say unholy, and what's the idea. And the idea is,

106
00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:30.380
well, it's sin that crutches at the door. The,

107
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.600
and that means to miss the Mark.

108
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:37.580
It means to make an error and it's something you have to invite into your life,

109
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:39.860
but it isn't just that you invite it in.

110
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:44.350
And it stands with you it's that you invited in this, this,

111
00:06:44.351 --> 00:06:46.400
this malevolent way of being,

112
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.900
and you enter into a creative union with it,

113
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.280
that's symbolized in this particular story using a sexual metaphor.

114
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.990
And it's the combination of your perverse will and this capacity for

115
00:06:59.991 --> 00:07:04.160
cruelty and malevolence that you meld together into something that's

116
00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:07.190
uniquely pathological and yours.

117
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.480
And that's basically what God tells Kane. That's what you've done.

118
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.710
And that's why your life isn't turning out as well as it might,

119
00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:19.510
or as well as your brothers. And so why don't you, uh,

120
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.880
get the hell out of my sight and think about that for a while

121
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.400
and Cain leaves and he's not happy about it at all

122
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.740
is fully understandable because you know,

123
00:07:32.741 --> 00:07:34.420
if you're having a wretched time of it,

124
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.830
then you're having a wretched time of it. And then if your brother's doing well,

125
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.150
you know, that's just salt in your wounds, man. And then,

126
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:47.170
then maybe you could rationalize that because the world's unfair and your

127
00:07:47.171 --> 00:07:50.950
brother is lucky and you're unlucky and all of that. And you can,

128
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:52.540
you know,

129
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.890
reserve a little bit of self-respect as a consequence of that rationalization,

130
00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.180
even though it's pretty thin,

131
00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:00.910
but then you decide to go and have it out with God.

132
00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:06.190
And he just basically says, no, that's all lies.

133
00:08:06.191 --> 00:08:08.500
And it's actually a hundred percent,

134
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.440
not only a hundred percent your fault,

135
00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.970
but something that you've done voluntarily and that, you know, you did,

136
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.840
and that you made far worse by doing it voluntarily.

137
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:24.340
And now you're lying about it and complaining about the structure of

138
00:08:24.341 --> 00:08:25.180
reality.

139
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.790
And so of all the bad news you could possibly get about why it

140
00:08:30.791 --> 00:08:35.110
is that things aren't going well for you. That's the worst,

141
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.200
especially if it's actually delivered by God,

142
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.500
because then it's hard to argue with.

143
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:49.180
So what happens? Oh, you'd think that maybe if Cain had any sense,

144
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.700
which he doesn't, he's too far gone,

145
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:56.490
he'd go sit in a cave for about a decade and eat locusts and honey,

146
00:08:56.491 --> 00:09:01.170
if he could find some and think about all the terrible things he did and then

147
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:06.090
come out and like apologize to Abel and to the people he didn't do well foreign

148
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.850
and like with a little humility,

149
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:13.050
start again and, and maybe have a life.

150
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.820
But that isn't what happens.

151
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.800
What happens is that he decides he's going to take revenge and he takes revenge

152
00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:24.300
in a terrible way. He kills Abel. And then you think, well,

153
00:09:24.301 --> 00:09:27.990
what does that mean? And this is a terrible story, right?

154
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.920
Cause it's really the first story about human beings that we have in,

155
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.010
at the base of our culture because Adam and Eve were made by God.

156
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:38.460
So they don't count Cain and Abel, they were born, they count.

157
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.170
And so the first story is this terrible murder of a brother and a

158
00:09:43.171 --> 00:09:48.170
murder that was motivated by jealousy and spite four,

159
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:53.450
four, four for living positively in the world,

160
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.870
right? It's about the worst story you could imagine.

161
00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:02.060
And so Cain goes and kills Abel and go, God,

162
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:07.040
you know, asks him about it. And Kane says, well, am I my brother's keeper?

163
00:10:07.041 --> 00:10:10.430
And that doesn't work out so well because God has actually figured it out.

164
00:10:10.431 --> 00:10:13.850
And Cain says, my punishment is more than I can bear.

165
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.730
And it might be because God has banished him.

166
00:10:16.731 --> 00:10:20.060
He's put a Mark on him and banished him and told people to leave Cain the hell

167
00:10:20.061 --> 00:10:20.894
alone.

168
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:26.030
And I think that was to stop like a cycle of revenge killings. Let's say,

169
00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.800
although it's complicated to say,

170
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:32.360
but maybe his punishment is more than he can bear because there's a problem.

171
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.890
When you take your ideal, let's say Abel happens to be your brother,

172
00:10:36.891 --> 00:10:37.641
but your ideal,

173
00:10:37.641 --> 00:10:41.210
the person you really wish you could be because that's what Kate wants.

174
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:46.250
And then you kill it. You've killed your ideal. You've destroyed your ideal.

175
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:47.420
And then what do you have?

176
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:50.690
You've got nothing because you need an ideal to live for.

177
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.470
And if you destroy your ideal, then you've got nothing. And Kane says, well,

178
00:10:54.471 --> 00:10:57.980
my punishment is more than I can bear. And maybe that's because life,

179
00:10:57.981 --> 00:11:01.370
without that ideal is more than can be born.

180
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.730
And well,

181
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.140
it gets worse from there really because you know, it,

182
00:11:09.141 --> 00:11:13.520
isn't only the table that Cain killed Abel to get rid of Abel

183
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:16.550
that's bad enough. It's plenty bad.

184
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.940
Even at the cost of his own soul, in some sense,

185
00:11:19.941 --> 00:11:22.730
which was something Kane was apparently willing to sacrifice.

186
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:27.260
But the real reason that he did it was to shake his fist in anger at the

187
00:11:27.261 --> 00:11:31.820
structure of reality itself, the unfairness of being,

188
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.350
and then that's metaphorically represented as the proclivity to take revenge on

189
00:11:36.351 --> 00:11:39.230
God, by destroying God's ideal.

190
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:44.780
And so the story is even darker than mere murder because it goes farther down

191
00:11:44.781 --> 00:11:46.190
than just homicide.

192
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:50.360
And if you're wondering why it is that people do the terrible things they do

193
00:11:50.361 --> 00:11:55.000
that are truly terrible. Things are almost in comprehensively, terrible.

194
00:11:55.001 --> 00:11:59.500
You have to go beyond mere motivation for homicide and even

195
00:11:59.501 --> 00:12:00.790
torture and homicide.

196
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.170
And you have to look at the motivations that will turn human beings against

197
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.580
being itself.
