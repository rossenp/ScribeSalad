00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.080
<v 0>What would you say to a young man looking to get into politics?</v>

2
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.130
<v 1>Well.</v>

3
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.320
<v 0>The first thing I would say is, um,</v>

4
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.880
it's a mistake to be fatally cynical about politics, because

5
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.370
for all the reasons there are to be fatally cynical about politics.

6
00:00:25.371 --> 00:00:30.230
There's much more reason to be fatally cynical about the conflict

7
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.030
that will inevitably arise or the tyranny that will inevitably manifest

8
00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:39.950
itself. If we can't handle the dirty business of politics properly.

9
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.530
So I would say don't become prematurely cynical

10
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.320
about it. The next thing I would say is.

11
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.870
<v 1>What do you know?</v>

12
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.130
<v 0>And that's a very important question. It's like,</v>

13
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.330
what does it mean to get into politics? Exactly.

14
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.910
Does that mean to see political power? Does that mean to seek power? Well,

15
00:01:04.911 --> 00:01:06.950
first of all, you shouldn't be seeking power.

16
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.480
You should be seeking competence and in order to seek competence,

17
00:01:11.481 --> 00:01:14.480
you better know something. And so I would say, well,

18
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.010
if you want to get into politics, you want to educate yourself. You know,

19
00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:22.610
in all the things you need to be educated in life. I mean, you can,

20
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.900
you can start to play the political game to familiarize yourself with it,

21
00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:30.110
but you know, it's not such a bad idea to, well,

22
00:01:30.111 --> 00:01:34.940
it's not such a bad idea to have a job for a while and maybe a career.

23
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.040
And maybe it's not such a bad idea to have a successful career upon in

24
00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:44.060
which people are dependent on you so that you start to understand what that sort

25
00:01:44.061 --> 00:01:45.470
of responsibility means.

26
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.520
And then maybe it's not such a bad idea to have a family because like human

27
00:01:49.521 --> 00:01:53.510
beings, mature adult human beings tend to have families.

28
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.410
And they transform when they have families. Because when you have children,

29
00:01:57.411 --> 00:02:01.400
then someone becomes more important to you than you are,

30
00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:05.600
and you're not mature until that happens. And so that's necessary.

31
00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:10.520
And so I would say, well, make sure that if you're looking to get into politics,

32
00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:14.720
that you're even more looking to get into competence and that you learn

33
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.390
everything you can possibly learn,

34
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.600
that would make you a reasonably wise person.

35
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.400
By the time you attain whatever level of power you might authority,

36
00:02:25.401 --> 00:02:27.590
let's say you might be seeking. I mean,

37
00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:31.180
I've seen lots of people get into politics, you know,

38
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.330
is happens with ideologues and the way they ratchet themselves up the power

39
00:02:35.331 --> 00:02:40.190
hierarchy is by being more effective avatars puppets of

40
00:02:40.191 --> 00:02:43.850
their particular ideological stance. And there's nothing about that.

41
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:48.530
That's useful. There's nothing in it that will solve any real world problems.

42
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.230
And there's plenty that will make it much worse.

43
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.590
And so if that's what getting into politics means, I would say,

44
00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:55.940
stay the hell away from it.

45
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.430
But if it's a matter of developing your character and then some point adopting

46
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:02.170
your social responsibility,

47
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.210
then go for it and more power to you because we need people who are competent

48
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:11.950
and careful and truthful and courageous and forthright to enter the

49
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:16.780
political sphere so that things don't degenerate and hopefully have some

50
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:20.080
chance of at least maintaining themselves or improving.

51
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.890
<v 2>So there's.</v>

52
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.870
<v 0>You need, what do you need to know?</v>

53
00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:29.250
You need to be really good at at least one thing you have to specialize.

54
00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:32.400
You have to be a great networker. You have to know a lot of people.

55
00:03:32.401 --> 00:03:35.400
You have to be honest. You have to be articulate. You have to,

56
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.970
you have to have a vision. You have to have a strategy.

57
00:03:38.971 --> 00:03:42.120
You have to know something about history and economics and politics.

58
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.300
Be good to know something about science. You know,

59
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.770
you have to be a polymath of sorts before you should dare to enter that realm

60
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.540
with any degree of confidence,

61
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.830
because otherwise all you are is a loose cannon and you'll come up with global

62
00:03:55.831 --> 00:03:59.160
proposals to improve, improve the world, you know,

63
00:03:59.161 --> 00:04:02.850
by waving your one that will do nothing, but make everything worse.
