1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.400
<v 0>And then eights in a week because I would thought, Oh, it's wrong. It's wrong.</v>

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.620
It's gotta be wrong. If you think it is wrong.

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.840
But if you take it on playful and that's what I do right now,

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.100
there's no thought I make it to ridiculous this hostile force.

5
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.690
There's so negative. Overwhelming called prime,

6
00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:26.190
orderly primordial early at Gatton to us that it is

7
00:00:26.191 --> 00:00:30.300
dangerous and all, I make it a laugh and joke and that, eh,

8
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.570
you see everybody having fun. That's only in denied.

9
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.310
One day came to me after fatiguing travel from wherever they come

10
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.860
from Hawaii to Australia, to New Zealand, to Japan, to Russia,

11
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.460
they all come there and fatiguing traveling.

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.030
They feel renewed and they sleep like babies.

13
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.210
That is the night number one. And then the,

14
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.130
in the morning they are excited, but they also like,

15
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.660
Oh, what happened? I don't know.

16
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:04.160
Maybe I cannot believe what happened then that I

17
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.540
into the breathing.

18
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.640
And then you had the biggest yelling of a releasing drama.

19
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.280
And I go to the ancestors and everything because I know how

20
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:21.990
to open up the closed up proteins because of drugs.

21
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.370
<v 1>What do you mean that you go to the ancestors? What do you mean by that?</v>

22
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.140
<v 0>That is anything that is genetically encrypted in our gene</v>

23
00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:34.640
expressions and closed up is because of a genetical past.

24
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.500
<v 1>Hey, so why do you write you?</v>

25
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.920
Why do you specifically refer to that as the ancestors?

26
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.300
What made you think that?

27
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.220
<v 0>Because we are the ancestors within our DNA,</v>

28
00:01:46.221 --> 00:01:50.630
we carry every inflammation of our ancestry,

29
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.680
like 13, like possibly a hundred,

30
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.120
as long as it is not solved. It's still within us.

31
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.610
<v 1>I've just, I've just written a new book and there's this I,</v>

32
00:02:04.611 --> 00:02:07.700
it's not out till March. There's a section in there.

33
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.590
There's an old mythological idea that the hero has to

34
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.390
rescue his, his sleeping father from the abyss,

35
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.040
from a terrible monster.

36
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.200
And I construed that in the book as the ability

37
00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:27.830
to awaken sleeping,

38
00:02:27.831 --> 00:02:32.690
ancestral forces likely coded genetically as a consequence of

39
00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:34.790
voluntary exposure to stress.

40
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.210
<v 0>Yes. That we come together. Jonah.</v>

41
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.130
This is what I do right now in San Francisco showing

42
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:44.420
through, uh, uh,

43
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.820
bringing back to you the primal primordial condition of the cell

44
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.640
to get it with the culture shock each up proteins.

45
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.770
What happens when you do practically? Yes, yes,

46
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.340
you do this. If you go record laterally in the cold,

47
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.530
then the activation of those cold shock proteins to the old Joey

48
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.050
chalk, because it's the same thing. It's through the hypothalamus and it works.

49
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.970
Boom, we get connection.

50
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.780
And then suddenly you bring a protective shield around the cell.

51
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.550
What happens inside the war is over guys. We can go into repair.

52
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.070
And then you noodle signaling. We talked about notice sickly.

53
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.840
I was able to bring a cold water under skin, skin temperature, not go down.

54
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.760
That is how can you do that for how long can I maintain it? As long as it takes,

55
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.650
as long as it takes, that is the power of our mind intention.

56
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.000
It's a real undiscovered area of psychiatry,

57
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.650
which I have discovered together with a professor by Bob,

58
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.180
Divakar a professor auto music and a Detroit.

59
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.950
Do you have the universe have to eat more because of that? No, no, no,

60
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.980
absolutely not. It's the power of your intention.

61
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.350
Your intention is able,

62
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.910
this is a general universal principle of our

63
00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:12.130
mind. Only not awakened to,

64
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.040
what's not discovered the first time somebody ran the four miles in

65
00:04:17.041 --> 00:04:21.280
a certain incredible year. Later 20 could do it.

66
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.050
That's the mind.

67
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.150
So what we find is if we expose it to

68
00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:32.920
people, then they begin, they change their paradigm, the paradigm,

69
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.470
this is what they say. We,

70
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.280
when mouth has found the secret of placebo,

71
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.390
placebo is no longer just over their head.

72
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.290
It's now with controllable healing force, whenever you need it.

73
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.560
It's the top down regulated,

74
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.540
entailed reception it's in, within our will. That's the new science.

75
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.500
And that, that brings us back to the ancestry.

76
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.420
So first we make this cell protected by a

77
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:06.910
shield, activating the culture.

78
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.510
Each are proteins that inside the cell,

79
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.260
you get a logically is sick note. Hey, there is no war anymore.

80
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.060
Energy is not needed to get inflammation out of it or to deal with inflammation

81
00:05:19.061 --> 00:05:23.530
or oxidative stress. Oh, let's go into the, uh, uh,

82
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.740
the close-up proteins of our ancestry.

83
00:05:26.741 --> 00:05:30.160
We can work it up now because now it's silent now. It's nice.

84
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.500
Now we got the energy pieces here.

85
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.840
This is the principle at general principle of nature. When you a wound, it,

86
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.790
you re retract, but if you are a war, you do,

87
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.500
you can even a coupon and shoot it with a Lakoff

88
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.920
shot. That's adrenaline cortisol.

89
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.990
That mode just keeps on going. That's what society that is all till wrong.

90
00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.310
There is no, there is no, uh, ability to retract.

91
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.380
No more work needs to be done daily. Uh, uh, uh,

92
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.490
how do you say, uh, uh, these, uh, yeah, what have,

93
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.580
I would need to be done all the time. It projects.

94
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.020
<v 1>Your people in Poland the first day. You,</v>

95
00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:21.250
you have them go outside in the cold for a long period of time with,

96
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.140
with no shoes on, for example,

97
00:06:23.141 --> 00:06:26.680
and they wake up the next day and you introduce them to the breathing. If,

98
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.820
if someone's doing this at home, like if, if I wanted to start this tomorrow,

99
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.790
I get up and have a cold shower and I would,

100
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.990
I would do that voluntarily as facing the stress. Okay.

101
00:06:37.991 --> 00:06:41.140
And then how would I, how would I do the breathing?

102
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.620
Would I do that after the shower? Would I do that in the afternoon?

103
00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:46.683
When would I do that?

104
00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.830
<v 0>You do it whenever you are completely rested,</v>

105
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.780
like relaxed,

106
00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.660
because the breathing will open up your physiology deeply.

107
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.720
If you go into deep stress while being a

108
00:07:04.721 --> 00:07:07.060
kind of, okay, that is the breathing,

109
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.920
the breathing exercises is a workout because the vascular

110
00:07:11.921 --> 00:07:15.670
system is more activated than somebody who's running.

111
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.480
You see, uh, lately I did a,

112
00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:24.100
a research with paralyzed people. Amazing.

113
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.140
<v 1>I can't, I can't do it when I'm relaxed because I'm never relaxed.</v>

114
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.200
<v 0>But you can, you can,</v>

115
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.120
you will directly intervene into,

116
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.240
into the neurological anxiety going on,

117
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:42.370
whatever is on the loose.

118
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:47.590
You will be able to create a extra altered current,

119
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:53.290
uh, within, uh, electrical current, the nervous system does it will be able to.

120
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.410
<v 1>Does it not matter when I do it then, like I could.</v>

121
00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.000
<v 0>Do a dust dock, Metta.</v>

122
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.760
<v 1>I mean, I wasn't able to do it with you.</v>

123
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:06.610
<v 0>Empty stomach. If you need me, I'm there any time you can call me,</v>

124
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:10.840
we have a zoom and we do it, but you don't need me.

125
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:16.060
I like to talk with you. Cause you got, you got a great, uh,

126
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:21.160
experience in words and a contemplation and a lot of expertise.

127
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:26.050
And I think we coincide a lot, like just now about the stress,

128
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.130
the ancestry.

129
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:32.860
<v 1>That took me like 15 years to figure out, because I've read all these stories.</v>

130
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.210
They're ancient stories.

131
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:38.110
That first the core element of the hero's journey,

132
00:08:38.111 --> 00:08:42.280
which is the proper journey through life is voluntary confrontation with what is

133
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:46.060
unknown and terrifying. That's the human way.

134
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:51.490
And one of the consequence of that is the rescuing of the dead father or the

135
00:08:51.491 --> 00:08:54.310
hurt father or the sleeping father. It like,

136
00:08:54.311 --> 00:08:58.050
it's a fundamental of Egyptian mythology, for example,

137
00:08:58.051 --> 00:09:00.310
ancient Egyptian mythology. And it's,

138
00:09:00.311 --> 00:09:03.820
it's part of the idea of the dying and resurrecting God it's, it's,

139
00:09:03.821 --> 00:09:05.700
it's entangled up in that as well.

140
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:10.770
And it wasn't until recently that I figured out that the consequence of

141
00:09:10.771 --> 00:09:15.570
voluntarily facing stress is the awakening of abilities within

142
00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:18.210
you that are part of our ancestral heritage.

143
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:23.070
And so that is how you become a living avatar of the great heroes of the

144
00:09:23.071 --> 00:09:27.510
past, but I never, it never occurred to me that, that,

145
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:32.520
that you could find high stress SIRS of a, of a safe,

146
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:35.100
physical type. So close at hand. I never,

147
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.810
I never really put that together. The idea that cold stress, for example,

148
00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:44.460
would be sufficient to start that process. What about heat?

149
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:49.380
Stress? I found saunas were actually useful for me, fasting, fasting,

150
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:50.573
fasting.

151
00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:57.380
<v 0>All those were great. Fast thing is for me, he says huge stress on me.</v>

152
00:09:57.381 --> 00:09:59.660
He says, uh, the cold stress,

153
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.760
but the breathing really it,

154
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.940
these breathing techniques, let me compare it.

155
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:10.790
It's been compared in brain scan studies of people doing

156
00:10:10.791 --> 00:10:14.540
four hours of mindfulness a day for years,

157
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.390
they could not get as,

158
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:22.430
as deep as a person practicing this type of, uh,

159
00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:26.330
breathing exercises, go into the depth of the brain.

160
00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:30.230
They could not get into the depth of the brain, even after years,

161
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:34.730
four hours of mindfulness a day. And these, uh, what we did,

162
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.920
we went deeper inside the brain, then dose people. So this,

163
00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:44.570
and that's in 30 breaths. Yes, this exercise, uh, which,

164
00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.860
uh, began with going into the cold. It made me

165
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:55.550
that's the first thing. Then you learn that through prolonged,

166
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.140
deep breathing,

167
00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:02.270
you learn to control the biochemistry insight to, uh,

168
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.210
to shake off the, uh, stressor,

169
00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:09.680
which is the cold and dust prolonged time in cold water.

170
00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:14.870
You find that out and it's all based on experience and sensation and it works.

171
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:15.800
Okay.

172
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.540
Then I began to disconnect the breathing from the goal called I

173
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:25.040
still was doing a teacher, but then I did these breathing exercises,

174
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.760
uh, at, Oh, and they blew my mind.

175
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.680
Anything that I had read in all the Asian scriptures,

176
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:38.030
I saw plenty. Oh, Oh, Oh, and deeper.

177
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:43.280
And now I found that these breathing exercises are able to go

178
00:11:43.281 --> 00:11:47.630
with our paradigm with medical science thought of is

179
00:11:47.631 --> 00:11:48.464
impossible.

180
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:53.120
And I'm showing this now I know you are

181
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:54.580
practicing.

182
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:59.530
<v 1>Conscious control over a semi unconscious function when you're exerting</v>

183
00:11:59.531 --> 00:12:03.880
control over your breathing and breathing is strange because it does occur

184
00:12:03.881 --> 00:12:06.610
unconsciously, but we can also modify it consciously.

185
00:12:06.611 --> 00:12:10.120
So it's right at the it's right at the, what would you say?

186
00:12:10.121 --> 00:12:12.880
The border between consciousness and unconsciousness?

187
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.310
<v 0>Interesting. Yeah, it's a good point. A good point. Uh,</v>

188
00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.230
it's a good point of view. It is.

189
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:20.970
<v 1>And we modulator,</v>

190
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:24.690
we modulate our breathing voluntarily all the time when we're speaking.

191
00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.670
And someone's also associated with the.

192
00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.400
<v 0>[Inaudible] amazing. Yes. Uh, that, that is so and done.</v>

193
00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.560
We saw in the brain scans in Germany and Hanover,

194
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:41.280
one of the best two brain scans of the world doing this breathing.

195
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.580
Normally we have a willful control over 60% of our

196
00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.740
neural activity in our brain.

197
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:55.380
And now they saw a hundred percent noodle activation

198
00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.830
within the brain, Don consciously,

199
00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.560
because we were doing the breathing exercises.
