00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.463
<v 0>Hi.</v>

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.320
I'd like to announce my new book beyond order 12 more rules for

3
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:08.640
life, which I've.

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.400
<v 1>Been working on diligently for the past three years.</v>

5
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.000
As of today,

6
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.920
the book is available for pre-order in the U S the UK and Canada.

7
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.380
I've linked to some major retailers,

8
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.850
including international links for Amazon in the videos description below.

9
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.900
I've also included the link to the beyond order page on my website,

10
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.940
Jordan B peterson.com,

11
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.260
where links to book retailers in different countries will be posted as they

12
00:00:36.261 --> 00:00:40.670
become available beyond order will also be published as an

13
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.390
ebook and as an audio book, which I have nearly finished recording,

14
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.780
all formats will be released on Tuesday, March 2nd, 2020.

15
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.910
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.510
<v 1>I want to provide you with a sense of the book in addition to announcing its</v>

17
00:00:56.511 --> 00:01:00.620
existence. So I thought I would read you a section from the overture,

18
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.830
the introduction, which describes the book's contents.

19
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.083
<v 0>Detail</v>

20
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.830
beyond order 12 more rules for life.

21
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.950
Why beyond order, it is simple. In some regard.

22
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.470
<v 1>Order is explored territory.</v>

23
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.760
We are in order when the actions we deem appropriate produce the results we aim

24
00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:23.594
at,

25
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.160
we regard such outcomes positively indicating as they do first,

26
00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:30.860
that we have moved closer to what we desire. And second,

27
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.610
that our theory about how the world works remains acceptably accurate.

28
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.463
<v 0>Nonetheless.</v>

29
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.300
<v 1>All States of order, no matter how secure and comfortable have their flaws.</v>

30
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:43.190
<v 0>Are knowledge.</v>

31
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.190
<v 1>Of how to act in the world remains eternally incomplete,</v>

32
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.760
partly because of our profound ignorance of the vast unknown,

33
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.190
partly because of our willful blindness.

34
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.170
And partly because the world continues in its in Tropic manner to transform

35
00:01:57.171 --> 00:01:58.610
itself unexpectedly.

36
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.913
<v 0>Furthermore.</v>

37
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.150
<v 1>The order we strive to impose on the world can rigidified as a consequence of</v>

38
00:02:05.151 --> 00:02:09.980
ill-advised attempts to eradicate from consideration, all that is unknown.

39
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.620
When such attempts go too far,

40
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.660
totalitarianism threatens driven by the desire to exercise full control

41
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.700
where such control is not possible.

42
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.760
<v 0>Even in principle, this means.</v>

43
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.590
<v 1>A dangerous restriction of all the psychological and social changes necessary to</v>

44
00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:30.680
maintain adaptation to the ever-changing world.

45
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.410
And so we find ourselves in escapable faced with the need to move beyond order

46
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.210
into itself.

47
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.130
<v 0>Opposite chaos, if order.</v>

48
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.390
<v 1>Where what we want makes itself known when we act in accordance with our hard</v>

49
00:02:44.391 --> 00:02:46.310
won wisdom, chaos is where,

50
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:50.810
what we do not expect to remain blind to leaps forward from the potential that

51
00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:51.644
surrounds us.

52
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.330
The fact that something has occurred many times in the past is no guarantee that

53
00:02:56.331 --> 00:02:58.640
it will continue to occur in the same manner.

54
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.920
There exists eternally a domain beyond what we know and.

55
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.260
<v 0>Can predict chaos is.</v>

56
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.050
<v 1>A normally novelty, unpredictability,</v>

57
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.370
transformation disruption, and all too often descent.

58
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.360
As what we have come to take for granted reveals itself is unreliable.

59
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.220
<v 0>Sometimes.</v>

60
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.660
<v 1>It manifests itself gently revealing its mysteries and experience that makes us</v>

61
00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:27.370
curious, compelled and interested. This is particularly likely,

62
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.810
although not inevitable when we approach what we do not understand voluntarily

63
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.030
with careful preparation and discipline.

64
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.280
Other times the unexpected makes itself known terribly suddenly

65
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.450
accidentally.

66
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.860
So we are undone and fall apart and can only put ourselves back together with

67
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:45.694
great difficulty.

68
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.153
<v 0>If at all.</v>

69
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.860
<v 1>Neither the state of order nor the state of chaos is preferable intrinsically.</v>

70
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.600
<v 0>The other that is the wrong way to look at it. Nonetheless.</v>

71
00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.100
<v 1>In my previous book, 12 rules for life, an antidote to chaos,</v>

72
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.240
I focus more on how the consequences of too much chaos might be remediated.

73
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.820
We respond to sudden and unpredictable change by preparing physiologically and

74
00:04:11.821 --> 00:04:13.650
psychologically for the worst.

75
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.910
And because only God himself knows what this worst might be.

76
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.360
We must in our ignorance prepare for all eventualities.

77
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.130
And the problem with that continual preparation is that in excess,

78
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.420
it exhausts us,

79
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.340
but that does not imply in any manner that chaos should be eliminated an

80
00:04:32.341 --> 00:04:34.230
impossibility in any case,

81
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.490
although what is unknown needs to be managed carefully as my previous book,

82
00:04:38.491 --> 00:04:39.090
repeatedly.

83
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.370
<v 0>Stressed, whatever.</v>

84
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.660
<v 1>Is not touched by the new stagnates. And it is certainly the case that a life,</v>

85
00:04:45.661 --> 00:04:46.980
without curiosity,

86
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.750
that instinct pushing us out into the unknown would be a much diminished form of

87
00:04:51.751 --> 00:04:56.610
existence. What is new is also what is exciting, compelling,

88
00:04:56.611 --> 00:04:57.450
and provocative.

89
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.620
Assuming that the rate at which it is introduced does not intolerably undermine

90
00:05:01.621 --> 00:05:03.030
and destabilize our state.

91
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.863
<v 0>Of being.</v>

92
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.960
<v 1>Like 12 rules for life.</v>

93
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.340
The current volume provides an explication of rules drawn from a longer list of

94
00:05:11.341 --> 00:05:16.080
42, originally published and popularized on the Q and a website Quora,

95
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.540
unlike my previous book, beyond order explorers as its overarching theme,

96
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.380
how the dangers of too much security and control might be profitable.

97
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.850
<v 0>Really avoided because what we understand is insufficient.</v>

98
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.510
<v 1>As we discover when things we are striving to control, nonetheless,</v>

99
00:05:33.511 --> 00:05:34.680
go wrong around us.

100
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.270
We need to keep one foot within order while stretching the other tentatively

101
00:05:39.271 --> 00:05:39.660
into the.

102
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.000
<v 0>Beyond. And so.</v>

103
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.410
<v 1>We are driven to explore and find the deepest of meanings in standing on the</v>

104
00:05:46.411 --> 00:05:49.800
frontier, secure enough to keep our fear under control,

105
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.920
but learning constantly learning as we face.

106
00:05:52.921 --> 00:05:55.620
What we have not yet made peace with or adapted.

107
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.460
<v 0>To it is this instinct.</v>

108
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.080
<v 1>Of meaning something far deeper than mere thought that orients us properly in</v>

109
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:07.940
life so that we do not become overwhelmed by what is beyond us or equally

110
00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:12.620
dangerously stultified and stunted by dated too narrow or too

111
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.050
prideful, fully paraded systems of value.

112
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.023
<v 0>Belief.</v>

113
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.260
What have I written about more specifically.

114
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.700
<v 1>One describes the relationship between stable,</v>

115
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.560
predictable social structures and individual psychological health and makes the

116
00:06:29.561 --> 00:06:33.130
case that such structures need to be updated by creative people.

117
00:06:33.131 --> 00:06:35.140
If they are to retain their vitality.

118
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:37.090
<v 0>Rule.</v>

119
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.950
<v 1>Two analyzes, a centuries old L chemical image, relying on several stories,</v>

120
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.200
ancient and modern to aluminate,

121
00:06:44.201 --> 00:06:47.470
the nature and development of the integrated human personality

122
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.380
Rule three warns of the dangers of avoiding the information vital to the

123
00:06:53.381 --> 00:06:57.760
continued rejuvenation of the psyche signaled by the emergence of negative

124
00:06:57.761 --> 00:07:01.150
emotions, such as pain, anxiety, and fear.

125
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:03.160
<v 0>Rule.</v>

126
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.300
<v 1>Four argues that the meaning that sustains people through difficult times is to</v>

127
00:07:07.301 --> 00:07:10.270
be found not so much in happiness, which is fleeting,

128
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.470
but in the voluntary adoption of mature responsibility for the self.

129
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.930
<v 0>And others rule.</v>

130
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.340
<v 1>Five uses a single example drawn from my experience as a clinical</v>

131
00:07:21.341 --> 00:07:25.780
psychologist to illustrate the personal and social necessity of attending to the

132
00:07:25.781 --> 00:07:27.250
dictates of conscience.

133
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.030
Rule six describes the danger of attributing,

134
00:07:31.031 --> 00:07:35.590
the cause of complex individual and social problems to single variables

135
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.790
such as sex.

136
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.600
<v 0>Class or power rules.</v>

137
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.070
<v 1>Seven outlines,</v>

138
00:07:42.071 --> 00:07:46.450
the crucial relationship between disciplines striving in a single direction and

139
00:07:46.451 --> 00:07:50.380
forging of the individual character capable of resilience in the face.

140
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.350
<v 0>Adversity rule eight.</v>

141
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:57.940
<v 1>Focuses on the vital importance of aesthetic experience as a guide to what is</v>

142
00:07:57.941 --> 00:08:02.290
true, good and sustaining in the human world of experience.

143
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:08.890
Rule nine makes the case that past experiences whose current recall remains

144
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:13.750
Laden with pain and fear can be stripped of their horror by voluntary verbal

145
00:08:13.751 --> 00:08:15.850
exploration and reconsideration.

146
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:18.910
<v 0>Okay.</v>

147
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:20.620
<v 1>Rule 10 notes,</v>

148
00:08:20.621 --> 00:08:25.180
the importance of explicit negotiation to maintenance of the Goodwill mutual

149
00:08:25.181 --> 00:08:30.130
regard and heartfelt cooperation without which no true romance can be

150
00:08:30.131 --> 00:08:30.964
sustained.

151
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:36.550
Rule 11 opens by describing the world of human experience in a manner that

152
00:08:36.551 --> 00:08:38.860
explains what motivates three common,

153
00:08:38.861 --> 00:08:43.630
but direly dangerous patterns of psychological response, delineates,

154
00:08:43.631 --> 00:08:48.190
the catastrophic consequences of falling prey to any or all of them and lays out

155
00:08:48.191 --> 00:08:49.024
an alternative.

156
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.600
<v 0>Route. Rule 12 finally.</v>

157
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:57.900
<v 1>Makes the case that thankfulness in the face of the inevitable tragedies of life</v>

158
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:02.700
should be regarded as a primary manifestation of the admirable moral courage

159
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.240
required to continue our difficult March uphill.

160
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:12.930
I hope that I am somewhat wiser in my explication of this second set of 12 rules

161
00:09:12.931 --> 00:09:14.430
than I was four years ago.

162
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:19.050
When I wrote about the first dozen not least because of the informative feedback

163
00:09:19.051 --> 00:09:22.980
I received in the course of my efforts to formulate my ideas for audiences

164
00:09:22.981 --> 00:09:27.960
around the world, in person on YouTube and through my podcast and blog.

165
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:33.210
I hope in consequence that I have managed to clarify some of the issues that

166
00:09:33.211 --> 00:09:36.870
were perhaps left less than optimally developed in my previous work,

167
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:41.100
as well as presenting much. That is original. Finally,

168
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:45.240
I hope that people find this book as helpful personally,

169
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.030
as they seem to have found the first set of 12 rules,

170
