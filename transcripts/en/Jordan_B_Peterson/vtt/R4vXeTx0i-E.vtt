00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.220
<v 1>Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry to interrupt.</v>

2
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.060
I want to welcome you to our VIP reception with Dr. Jordan Peterson.

3
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.570
We're so glad to have you all with us. I'd just be brief. Uh,

4
00:00:19.571 --> 00:00:24.260
I do want to especially thank Don Sebastiani. Don's a boss,

5
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.240
Johnny and sons for very generously donating the wines that we have

6
00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:33.170
tonight for the reception. And I hope you'll enjoy them. Um,

7
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.310
Dr. Peterson will be here momentarily to take photos. Um,

8
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.060
for all those who are interested, um, right afterward,

9
00:00:41.061 --> 00:00:45.650
we're going to have a Q and a session where you can personally ask a questions

10
00:00:45.651 --> 00:00:50.360
with him and have a conversation. Uh, so please enjoy yourself and, um,

11
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.040
thank you again for joining with us.

12
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.053
<v 2>Thank you.</v>

13
00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.800
So my question is related to an interview you did with Camille Paglia

14
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.490
not long ago. And he referring to Robert Sapolsky,

15
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.500
his work about the zebras and how the lions don't go after the zebras,

16
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.040
because they're camouflaged into the herd, not to the landscape.

17
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.410
And it's a Polsky would put a red dot on a haunch and the lions would then go

18
00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:23.410
after that zebra. And I get that. I believe that's true, but my question,

19
00:01:23.411 --> 00:01:28.400
how did the lions communicate with each other to go after the one zebra

20
00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:31.940
with the red dot? Well,

21
00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:35.030
I think the answer to that is that lions are lugged smarter than we think they

22
00:01:35.031 --> 00:01:38.450
are. You know, when you think about it, you know,

23
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.300
like hunting animals have to be very,

24
00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.670
very intelligent when they hunt in packs,

25
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.480
because they're obviously communicating with one another constantly and they

26
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.930
isolate an individual that's identifiable in some sense.

27
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.320
And they seem to be able to determine perhaps from its behavior,

28
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.460
perhaps because of the behavior of the hunters, what, what that animal is.

29
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.680
But I mean, to be a predator means to manifest substantial intelligence,

30
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.120
science. Think we understand it very well at all. Yeah. Well,

31
00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:11.360
animals are strange, you know, you know how they can pick up your emotions.

32
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.150
They're, they're very good at decoding nonverbal behavior.

33
00:02:14.151 --> 00:02:16.490
And so they're communicating through their posture and so forth,

34
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.440
but I don't think we understand it very well at all.

35
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.470
So you bet another question.

36
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.480
<v 3>Dr. Is there college professor here in California,</v>

37
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.800
you said some things that are a little bit disheartening to me as an educator

38
00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:35.480
for our youth who are bringing them up into this new society and educating them

39
00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:39.530
to think deeply about what the meaning is for themselves as individuals.

40
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.070
How do you see current

41
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.710
academics as failing our students now?

42
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.381
<v 2>Well, you know,</v>

43
00:02:51.381 --> 00:02:55.220
I really think they'll faculties of education should probably just be burned to

44
00:02:55.221 --> 00:03:00.160
the ground. You know, I mean, they're failing them.

45
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.881
They're,

46
00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:05.320
they're failing the faculties of education in particular are failing them in a

47
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:06.190
variety of ways.

48
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:10.390
The first is that I've seen no evidence coming from the faculties of education,

49
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.400
that our understanding of how to educate children more efficiently has

50
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:19.780
progressed at all in the last 40 years. In fact, I think it's gone backwards.

51
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.550
And a lot of the things, the faculties of education had pushed like self-esteem,

52
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.820
which actually doesn't exist because it's measured in properly,

53
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.690
like whole word learning, for example, like multiple intelligences,

54
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.500
all these things have actually set the cause of education back substantially

55
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:38.590
because they're not there. They're not based on anything that's real.

56
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.090
And then the introduction of, of weld this,

57
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:46.150
this very complex gender education to me is,

58
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.410
is nothing but ideology. It's,

59
00:03:48.411 --> 00:03:53.110
it's being introduced to children who are far too young and who have enough

60
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.340
confusion in their life without adding that additional dimension. But more,

61
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.880
most importantly, I think that the education system,

62
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.960
it doesn't teach kids to read, well, it doesn't teach them to write well,

63
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.530
it doesn't teach them to think about thinking. So they can't think critically.

64
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.330
And it does almost nothing to help them understand that they have a character

65
00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:15.760
that they could develop. You know, I mean,

66
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.260
this has been true for a very long time and there's historical reasons for it,

67
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:23.890
but be very good, you know, to, to have what,

68
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.450
what grade do you teach college? All college? Well,

69
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.010
even with the college kids,

70
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.760
like no one's ever sat down with most of those kids and ask them for example,

71
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:35.820
to write an essay of any length of,

72
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.990
with any degree of seriousness on who they would like to be.

73
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.490
And I don't mean career wise,

74
00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:47.320
although that's part of it and why to justify that it's an unbelievably useful

75
00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:49.210
exercise. And so,

76
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.220
especially if you're in the humanities here, your job is to teach character,

77
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.250
the character development, and we just don't do that. Well,

78
00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.310
we take it and we tear everything apart and put nothing back together.

79
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:04.660
And it's a terrible thing for, for young people. So that's,

80
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:05.583
that's some of the.

81
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.550
<v 5>Hi Dr. Peterson. Um, another education question. Um,</v>

82
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.550
we have a daughter who's in fifth grade in San Francisco.

83
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.240
She's in a private school because the public schools here are by and large

84
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.390
abysmal. Um, and they are,

85
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.020
I recall hearing a lecture of yours where you said, um,

86
00:05:31.021 --> 00:05:35.100
as soon as the school starts teaching your kids, things like equity, diversity,

87
00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:39.050
and inclusion, pull them out. And our daughter's school is,

88
00:05:39.051 --> 00:05:43.350
is deep and wide into that. And there seems to be no escape.

89
00:05:43.351 --> 00:05:46.980
So my husband and I agreed that we would do whatever you say tonight.

90
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.240
So he said.

91
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.630
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>

92
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.400
<v 5>So the solution is that we just need to teach her our values,</v>

93
00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.800
our individual system at home. Well, I say, let's think about pulling her out.

94
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:01.880
So what do you say.

95
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.740
<v 6>Um, how, how good are you at teaching her your individual values at home?</v>

96
00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.100
Like, can you, can you help her think it through? Is she confused by it?

97
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.530
<v 5>Um, she, she is confused by it,</v>

98
00:06:14.531 --> 00:06:16.810
but she's mostly rebelling and whenever I try to bring it up,

99
00:06:16.811 --> 00:06:17.890
she gets very angry.

100
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.473
<v 6>And is she,</v>

101
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.130
is she rebelling against your attempts to counter it or is she what's she saying.

102
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.550
<v 5>She's angry because she loves, she loves her friends at her school.</v>

103
00:06:27.551 --> 00:06:31.720
She's afraid of us pulling her out and she's defensive of her school.

104
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.350
<v 6>Well, okay.</v>

105
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.980
So the first thing I would say is that I wouldn't give you advice because I

106
00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:41.770
don't know the particularities of your situation. Well enough.

107
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.630
I think that you're given what you just

108
00:06:46.631 --> 00:06:47.464
told me,

109
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:52.780
your attempts to provide her with the values that you can provide her with at

110
00:06:52.781 --> 00:06:55.900
home are probably her best longterm defense in any case,

111
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.470
it isn't obvious to me that you're going to find a place where this isn't a

112
00:06:59.471 --> 00:07:02.200
problem. So, and she's in grade five.

113
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.530
<v 5>She is. And by the way, my husband keeps whispering, uh,</v>

114
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.850
tools are so in my head.

115
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.250
<v 6>Is one of the prerogatives of being married, at least from time to time.</v>

116
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:16.000
So I would, I think it's pretty,

117
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.850
you could try the values,

118
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.060
move for a good while before you do anything more radical. You know,

119
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.930
there's something to be said for minimum necessary force and you don't want to

120
00:07:25.931 --> 00:07:29.800
set up any more rebellion on her part then is absolutely necessary.

121
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.940
I don't know if that'll be sufficient, but hopefully it will. Yeah. You bet.

122
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:34.923
You bet.

123
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.080
<v 5>Hi. Um,</v>

124
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:42.880
how do as a student at this university, how do I, I mean,

125
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:46.600
it's hard to me sometimes. I mean, I see the university like crumble,

126
00:07:46.601 --> 00:07:49.920
like everyday it's like in all these ideology, like how,

127
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:53.980
and I just find it hard to like, how do I keep myself like motivated or like,

128
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:57.850
like, like finding meaningful to continue and like.

129
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.470
<v 6>Well, your best bet in university is you at least have the chance to read.</v>

130
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.940
You know, what you need to do is to, I have a list of books on my website,

131
00:08:06.941 --> 00:08:11.410
which you may know about, or may not. You could go read all those books. Good,

132
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:15.070
good. Well, the thing is, is that the best thing you can do if you're,

133
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:15.760
if you're,

134
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.740
if you're inundated by foolish teaching is to go

135
00:08:20.741 --> 00:08:24.010
read all the books that people have thought have are great,

136
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:28.300
because lots of them are great. And then you can make your peer group,

137
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:32.590
the people who wrote those books and hopefully that'll be enough.

138
00:08:32.591 --> 00:08:36.010
So that you'll be a lot more than you were, and that'd be something,

139
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:40.750
but you have the opportunity to do that. Even if you're not encouraged to do it,

140
00:08:40.751 --> 00:08:44.710
you can do the reading. And I don't know of any better that.

141
00:08:44.711 --> 00:08:49.240
And I would also say to write, you know, write, read something, great,

142
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.020
write about it, get your thoughts in order, and that'll help straighten you up.

143
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.840
And you might as well read best since it's there and it's free,

144
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.420
which is also something quite remarkable.

145
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.560
I don't know anything better than that. So thank you. Yeah.

146
00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.880
<v 7>Dr. Peterson, a lot of what you say really resonates with me.</v>

147
00:09:10.881 --> 00:09:12.200
And so I listened to it quite a bit,

148
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:16.730
but sometimes I feel as though you take the position that these people who are

149
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.070
concerned about sexism, racism,

150
00:09:19.071 --> 00:09:22.250
and other kinds of discrimination are a bunch of whiners.

151
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:25.370
And I wonder what you really feel about that and how, what you would have,

152
00:09:25.371 --> 00:09:26.570
how you would address that issue.

153
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:31.310
<v 6>Oh, I think it's true. I mean,</v>

154
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.900
it's not that I don't think that there are forms of arbitrary prejudice that are

155
00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.690
counterproductive, obviously that's the case. And,

156
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:42.860
and I think that that's detrimental to everyone. I mean, we,

157
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.840
it would be wonderful to build a society where people were invited and

158
00:09:47.841 --> 00:09:52.730
encouraged to participate based on their level of skill in relationship to

159
00:09:52.731 --> 00:09:55.670
the required tasks, right? That's, that's what we'd want.

160
00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:00.340
And there are arbitrary barriers, but two, but the, the,

161
00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:05.240
the victim culture that's been generated on the university campuses is not

162
00:10:05.241 --> 00:10:07.880
only unwarranted in my estimation,

163
00:10:07.881 --> 00:10:12.860
given how much better things are say in the United States on the

164
00:10:12.861 --> 00:10:17.000
sexism and racism front than say 50 years ago or 40 years ago,

165
00:10:17.001 --> 00:10:21.380
or 30 years ago or 20 years ago, there's been unbelievable improvement.

166
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.030
And not only that,

167
00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:27.980
the emphasis on microaggressions and safe spaces and, and, uh,

168
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:33.230
and, and interferes with freedom of speech are definitely making students less

169
00:10:33.231 --> 00:10:35.600
resilient rather than more resilient. I mean,

170
00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:40.220
every psychotherapist worth his salt knows that because

171
00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:45.470
the way that you help people overcome their anxieties is by exposing them

172
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:50.180
voluntarily to things that they neither things that they're afraid of and are

173
00:10:50.181 --> 00:10:52.880
disgusted by. And it's the core,

174
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.090
it's the core apart from getting your story straight,

175
00:10:56.091 --> 00:10:59.090
it's actually the core of all successful psychotherapies.

176
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:01.610
And so by protecting students, there's just,

177
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:06.050
there's there isn't anything you can do that would make them less resilient than

178
00:11:06.051 --> 00:11:10.550
what's being done in the universities and Jonathan height and Greg glucan off in

179
00:11:10.551 --> 00:11:13.640
their book, coddling of the American mind laid that out pretty nicely.

180
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:17.660
The American psychological association and the American psychiatric association

181
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.480
should have put out statements in this regard years ago,

182
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.520
because everyone knows if they're trained properly, that,

183
00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.550
that this is just not how you go about doing it.

184
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:29.780
It doesn't mean that it doesn't mean that if you're concerned with arbitrary

185
00:11:29.781 --> 00:11:34.310
discrimination, that that somehow makes you whine. Like I don't,

186
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:38.060
I don't believe that because discrimination is real and it's, it's,

187
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.330
it's pointless. It's harmful. How do we,

188
00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.950
how do we address it? I think, well, I think,

189
00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:47.900
I think we are addressing it first of all,

190
00:11:47.901 --> 00:11:52.790
because we're much less prejudice than we were like at any other point in known.

191
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:57.160
So that's the first thing is that things have improved at a rate that's so

192
00:11:57.161 --> 00:11:58.990
dramatic that it's almost unbelievable,

193
00:11:58.991 --> 00:12:02.800
but the way I think that we improve it is that we crush it out inside our

194
00:12:02.801 --> 00:12:06.340
individual souls. You know, for me, this is,

195
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:08.350
that's why I concentrate on the individual,

196
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.620
organizing ourselves into tribes and, and,

197
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.600
and making that our paramount identity.

198
00:12:13.601 --> 00:12:17.110
And then teaching students that the appropriate way to view history as,

199
00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:20.920
as the battleground between identity groups is just a reversion to tribalism.

200
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:25.210
And that's like, whenever a society reverts to tribalism,

201
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.340
all that happens is that violence breaks out.

202
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:31.690
There's obviously because tribal groups are violent.

203
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.840
And if you can't speak between your tribes,

204
00:12:34.841 --> 00:12:39.100
because there are so clearly different demarcated and there's no communication,

205
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:43.480
all there is left is violence. And so I just don't see that as, I mean,

206
00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:44.830
even if the people let's,

207
00:12:44.831 --> 00:12:49.360
let's give 50% of the people who are complaining about discrimination

208
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:52.840
there do, as people who are genuinely concerned,

209
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.130
their solution is inappropriate. All it's going to do is cause more trouble.

210
00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:01.450
And the idea that, you know, there shouldn't be a uniting narrative.

211
00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:05.890
I think that's completely observed because it's a uniting, we're all here.

212
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.150
And we're all peaceful at the moment, despite our pathologies,

213
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:14.590
because there's a uniting narrative, everyone knows what they're doing here.

214
00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:18.670
And so everyone acts in a manner that allows everyone to predict each other.

215
00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:22.780
And that's why we're peaceful because we're all half crazy, you know?

216
00:13:22.781 --> 00:13:24.670
And there's lots of times, we're not peaceful.

217
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:28.480
You need those uniting narratives and they have to be super to the group

218
00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:29.680
identity. And.

219
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:33.180
<v 7>I'll look inside ourselves. Every single one society seems to say,</v>

220
00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:36.630
everybody look at yourself carefully and see if you're doing discrimination.

221
00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:39.600
And if you are being discriminatory, stop it. Yeah.

222
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:43.200
<v 6>Yeah. Well, that's it. And it's not just discriminatory. I'm, I'm sure that,</v>

223
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:44.220
you know, the,

224
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:49.470
my sense is that the average person myself included has more than enough sins

225
00:13:49.471 --> 00:13:51.360
on their conscience to keep themselves busy,

226
00:13:51.361 --> 00:13:53.610
polishing themselves up for the rest of their life.

227
00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.450
And so I think that's a really good place to start because, you know,

228
00:13:57.451 --> 00:14:01.260
you take the responsibility on yourself and if you're looking outside for

229
00:14:01.261 --> 00:14:02.370
someone to blame, then,

230
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.540
then that's the first sign that there's probably something wrong.

231
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.330
And it's not like, I don't know that some people have it rough.

232
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:11.520
Some people have it rough. And, and,

233
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.550
and it's because of external things that have happened to them,

234
00:14:14.551 --> 00:14:19.530
but their best bet still is to take the responsibility for fixing

235
00:14:19.531 --> 00:14:22.950
that onto themselves. And you weaken people,

236
00:14:22.951 --> 00:14:26.040
if you say that they're the passive victim of external forces,

237
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:30.990
and then they become the passive victims of external forces and it's

238
00:14:30.991 --> 00:14:32.850
not good. So, yeah.

239
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:33.840
<v 7>Um,</v>

240
00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.470
is there a generational divide in the themes of the questions that you get and

241
00:14:37.471 --> 00:14:39.090
which ones do you find the most entertaining?

242
00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.070
<v 6>I really think there is a generational divide, particularly.</v>

243
00:14:44.071 --> 00:14:48.480
I haven't noticed it. Um, most entertaining.

244
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.160
God, that's a tough one. I mean.

245
00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:56.573
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

246
00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:01.180
<v 6>I mean a lot,</v>

247
00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:04.810
I wouldn't say that what I've been doing for the last three years has been fun,

248
00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.380
but it's been unbelievably worthwhile and meaningful, you know, like it's,

249
00:15:10.381 --> 00:15:14.560
it's, it's definitely been I've,

250
00:15:14.561 --> 00:15:19.060
I've continued to do it because I can't think of anything better to do than to

251
00:15:19.061 --> 00:15:23.620
come to an event like this and to talk seriously to people about issues that

252
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.820
I hope are fundamental. And the evidence seems to be that it,

253
00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.810
as far as I can tell that it's doing a substantial number of people,

254
00:15:31.811 --> 00:15:35.920
a substantial amount of good. And so that's not fun precisely,

255
00:15:35.921 --> 00:15:40.240
but it's better than fun, but I can tell you one thing that, well,

256
00:15:40.241 --> 00:15:43.960
this is how it's better than fun. In some sense, you know,

257
00:15:43.961 --> 00:15:45.670
I mentioned this in my talk tonight.

258
00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:50.200
It's very affecting to

259
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:54.910
travel all over the world and to have people that I don't know,

260
00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:59.950
come up to me constantly. Like if I was outside during the day,

261
00:15:59.951 --> 00:16:04.690
it would happen 50 times and say, look, I was having a hell of a time.

262
00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:10.240
And here's why, and here's the things I've done to change and it's way better.

263
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:11.890
And you know,

264
00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:15.640
there isn't anything you could hope for that would be better in your life than

265
00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:19.030
to be able to travel to places you've never been everywhere.

266
00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:24.250
And for perfect strangers to come up to you on the street politely and tell you

267
00:16:24.251 --> 00:16:27.880
that their lives are much better than they were. And,

268
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:32.410
and that it was because of, uh, paying some attention to what,

269
00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:37.480
to what I've been communicating, not originating, but communicating.

270
00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.920
So that's, that's a great thing. And as long as that continues,

271
00:16:41.921 --> 00:16:45.820
then I'll continue doing this and I'll be content with whatever fun I managed to

272
00:16:45.821 --> 00:16:47.230
extract from the process.

273
00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:52.630
<v 8>[Inaudible].</v>

274
00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:56.620
<v 6>We'll just do one more cause I'm starting to, to not be very coherent.</v>

275
00:16:56.621 --> 00:17:00.100
And so that's always a good place to stop. So who's got the mic.

276
00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:02.770
<v 3>I think I got the mic. If logos speaks,</v>

277
00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:07.390
habital order into chaos and we reflect that by speaking truth. And that's good.

278
00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.220
Then when we fail to speak truth,

279
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.270
is that evil and how is it differentiated from the original chaos that was being

280
00:17:13.271 --> 00:17:14.104
spoken to?

281
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:20.770
<v 6>Well, it's definitely, I would say that it's, I would say yes, that it's evil.</v>

282
00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:22.600
That that's the right way of thinking about it.

283
00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:30.070
The adult, the initial chaos is more, it's more,

284
00:17:30.071 --> 00:17:35.020
pluripotential like it, it has the alternatives of going many ways.

285
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.440
If you like, I've dealt with families,

286
00:17:37.441 --> 00:17:42.190
say in my clinical practice who who've practiced many generations of deep lies.

287
00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:47.230
And so there's a potential there, right? That, that the lies generated,

288
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:52.200
but it's almost impossible to set it straight. Like once,

289
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:54.900
once you cast something like that into being,

290
00:17:55.230 --> 00:18:00.000
it's much more difficult to turn to the good, you know,

291
00:18:00.001 --> 00:18:04.380
you know, it's obvious, you know, you, you think, Oh,

292
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:07.710
this is the day I'm finally gonna tell off my boss. And it's like,

293
00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:09.810
maybe you should have had, uh,

294
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.470
an intelligent conversation with him at a slightly lower voice,

295
00:18:13.471 --> 00:18:16.170
voice tone three years ago, you know?

296
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.620
And so it's a little late and you go there and you, you,

297
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:23.070
you sacrifice your job because you can no longer control your anger.

298
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:26.220
And now you're unemployed and you don't have a record,

299
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.500
a good employment record for your next job.

300
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:32.760
And now your family doesn't have anything to rely on. So like, that's chaos,

301
00:18:32.761 --> 00:18:37.260
man, but it's not easy to set straight. Whereas normally,

302
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:40.950
as long as you haven't done anything to pathological,

303
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.870
what opens up in front of you is, is past that could go in either direction.

304
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:50.190
You know, it's not that hard to set it straight it's,

305
00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.730
but once you've made the mistake, well,

306
00:18:53.731 --> 00:18:56.730
you have to fix the mistake and then you have to recast the potential.

307
00:18:56.731 --> 00:18:58.410
And that's, that's hard.

308
00:18:58.411 --> 00:19:01.350
It requires you have to admit that you did something wrong.

309
00:19:01.351 --> 00:19:05.250
You have to have the humility to note that you, that you're the one in error.

310
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:08.970
You have to calculate the strategy for setting it, right.

311
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:11.370
You have to implement it. And then you have to decide,

312
00:19:11.371 --> 00:19:16.230
you're not going to do it again. Right? That's the full, what do you call that?

313
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.280
When you go to Catholic church and you confess,

314
00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:25.260
you have to confess and you have to repent and you know, and you have to atone.

315
00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:30.660
And that's what you do to eradicate evil is you confess and you repent and you

316
00:19:30.661 --> 00:19:35.520
atone. And those out to a tone is to that's at one,

317
00:19:35.521 --> 00:19:40.140
right? To Reester that initial unity. It's very, very difficult.

318
00:19:40.141 --> 00:19:41.280
And the more things like that,

319
00:19:41.281 --> 00:19:45.510
you pile up around yourself that lower the probability that you'll straighten it

320
00:19:45.511 --> 00:19:50.490
out. So that's how it's different. Yep. All right.

321
00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:56.930
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>
