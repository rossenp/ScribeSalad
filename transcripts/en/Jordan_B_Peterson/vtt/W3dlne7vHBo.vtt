00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.610
<v 0>Like right now. And right now,</v>

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.740
the last conversation I had with Dr. Kevin Tracy,

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.560
it was in the board and for the jewelry, uh,

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.950
four Nobel prize winners or medical in the medical area.

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.830
He tested me in 2007 and he sold me influencing deeply into the

6
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.080
Vegas nerve and the Vegas nerve that is considered to be autonomy outside of

7
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.340
our will. Right?

8
00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:30.960
If you are able to control or influence deeply into the Vegas nerve,

9
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.450
you are able to bring down inflammation,

10
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.020
which is cause and effect of disease.

11
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.600
We found the answers in nature.

12
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.170
Can you describe in any way that would be comprehensible to someone who didn't

13
00:00:45.171 --> 00:00:46.004
know how to do it,

14
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.240
how you manage such things as control over the vagus nerve?

15
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.080
Yes, the vagus nerve and the autonomous nervous system,

16
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.140
the immune system and the endocrine system,

17
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.630
all those were thought to be out of our willful

18
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.170
patrol. And 2014,

19
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.450
I showed four as the first one in medical science to be able to be

20
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.700
injected and then have no sentence with equal light

21
00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:19.040
bacteria, which can be lethal.

22
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.050
It's a strong bacteria and it causes

23
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.390
the cytokine storm.

24
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.730
Cytokine storm is inflammatory markers go and be Zurich within

25
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.380
our buddy because it doesn't not know what's happening and everything is in our

26
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.720
lab and it can damage our system.

27
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.060
That's a side to get stalk and we could not do that stuck.

28
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.860
And that day he tested me and I showed as the first one to be

29
00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:51.350
injected and have no idea.

30
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.650
And so what did you do after you were injected to, to,

31
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.190
to stop doing things? Okay. I did two things. First of all,

32
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.690
I used my mind

33
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.800
and not just explained what the mind is capable of.

34
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.120
If it is connected to distress mechanisms, I will willful control.

35
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.520
Then you can give a neuro-psych know to the neurology

36
00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:21.230
of the rest of the body to do whatever is necessary to,

37
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.600
uh, to, uh, neutralize physical impact of any kind.

38
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.150
That is, that is the real connection we possibly all have.

39
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.310
But I did that.

40
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.300
Then I used my will and I used breathing

41
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.550
and this breathing technique, apparently it's an amazing technique,

42
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.710
which has not known no way because I found it out by going into cold water

43
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.580
and cold water, you are directly

44
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.210
exposed to deep stress, freezing water, deep stress.

45
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.530
Are you buddy? What do you do? You don't think you do.

46
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.490
You learn to regulate biochemistry by deep breathing,

47
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.640
you jump into cold water and then you breathe the automatically like you,

48
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.920
like you demonstrated. And then you've,

49
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.600
you've played with that breathing and learned what I learned that

50
00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:26.040
through deep breathing, I was able to prolong my,

51
00:03:26.041 --> 00:03:30.240
stay into an cult water like tenfold.

52
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.430
How long did it take you?

53
00:03:32.431 --> 00:03:35.580
How many months or years did it take you to only a couple of months,

54
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.300
a couple of months, couple of months. And I could stay,

55
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.130
I also did my breathing exercises and I could state

56
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.170
for five to seven minutes, breath, hold that's another thing.

57
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.740
And it's not sports. It's just,

58
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.990
our capacity is much more than we normally use. Right,

59
00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.910
right in. You're making the,

60
00:03:59.911 --> 00:04:04.320
you're making the case that if we expose our still ourselves to relatively

61
00:04:04.321 --> 00:04:08.760
extreme stressors, that we become more integrated psychophysiological. Yes.
