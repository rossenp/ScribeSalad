00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.890
<v 0>No, I've met lots of people who were suicidal because of that,</v>

2
00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:07.590
but also unwilling to take care of themselves, you know,

3
00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:10.440
because there was so guilty about who they were and,

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.390
and their motive being in the world that they just felt that they weren't worth

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.310
the dam. You know, and, and

6
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.270
while in there all have their own particular reasons for,

7
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.630
for believing that their own failures,

8
00:00:26.631 --> 00:00:28.880
their own improper sacrifices,

9
00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:31.730
let's say their own acts of individual malevolence,

10
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.880
but there are some DAP in a lovely metaphorical manner,

11
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.140
a horrifying metaphorical manner in those ancient stories.

12
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.920
And those stories explained to us to why as well,

13
00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:47.510
that our consciousness don't sit well with us and why we always feel that

14
00:00:47.511 --> 00:00:50.840
there's something undone that we should be doing in the world,

15
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.480
which is a much better pathway to take by the way,

16
00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:57.740
then to degenerate into nihilism and, and catastrophe.

17
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.780
And so, and that's really ruled too. It's like, well,

18
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.890
you should treat yourself like you're someone responsible for helping.

19
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.690
And the first question is, well, why don't you? And the answer is,

20
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.650
well, there's a lot wrong with you, you know,

21
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.780
and it's hard to exercise

22
00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:23.600
enough, love and care.

23
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.760
They're in a deep and non naive way to care properly

24
00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:31.700
for something like that. But, you know,

25
00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:34.850
you do it for people that you love despite their inadequacies.

26
00:01:34.851 --> 00:01:38.990
And there is this idea that there is a spark of divinity within us,

27
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.730
and it is possible that the fact that you have that spark of

28
00:01:43.731 --> 00:01:47.990
divinity with you within you also means that you have the

29
00:01:47.991 --> 00:01:52.220
capability to withstand that terrible vulnerability.

30
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.890
That's what I was trying to get at in chapter one,

31
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.740
which was to stand up straight with your shoulders back,

32
00:01:57.741 --> 00:02:02.210
that you could actually voluntarily accept the onslaught of the

33
00:02:02.211 --> 00:02:06.800
tragedy of being and that you can constrain the proclivity for

34
00:02:06.801 --> 00:02:10.520
malevolence. That's part of you and that's part of the world.

35
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.880
And in that you can discover your own value,

36
00:02:13.881 --> 00:02:16.730
your own intrinsic value in your own nobility and,

37
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.770
and all of that might be more powerful than the forces of vulnerability

38
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.240
and malevolence themselves, which I also happen to believe.

39
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.860
And I think that that is in some sense, the fundamental hallmark of faith.

40
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.450
And so chapter two, and to some degree, chapter three,

41
00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:39.980
which is to surround yourself with people who want the best for you is

42
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.940
a,

43
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.700
it's an encouragement to assume to act out

44
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.530
the proposition that even if life is as difficult

45
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.300
as it seems to be,

46
00:02:53.301 --> 00:02:57.860
and if you're as vulnerable and weak in a fundamental sense,

47
00:02:57.861 --> 00:03:02.260
as you definitely and characterized by this terrible

48
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.090
propensity for the infliction of voluntary

49
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:11.350
suffering on yourself and others, and that destructive tendency,

50
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.520
that there's still something within you. That's so remarkable.

51
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.870
So aligned with,

52
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.450
with orders and being in the proper manner that you can climb above that,

53
00:03:24.451 --> 00:03:28.740
let's say like a table and that you can make the proper sacrifices and that you

54
00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:32.040
can set yourself, right. And you can set your family, right.

55
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.080
And you can set the world, right.

56
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.130
And that the mere possibility that that might occur,

57
00:03:38.131 --> 00:03:42.840
that that might be within the realm of potential means

58
00:03:42.841 --> 00:03:47.370
that you have a moral obligation to exercise the responsibility,

59
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.840
to take care of yourself as if you're something that matters.

60
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.720
And that if you did that properly,

61
00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.090
it might turn out that what you did would matter that it would matter to

62
00:04:00.091 --> 00:04:03.960
you that it would be meaningful in the way that things that matter are

63
00:04:03.961 --> 00:04:07.380
meaningful and that it would matter to everyone around you.
