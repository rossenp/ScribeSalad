1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.190
<v 0>I think actually that people are quite hard on themselves. And you know,</v>

2
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:09.150
this is one of the reasons that I believe that the presumption of innocence that

3
00:00:09.151 --> 00:00:13.830
characterizes our legal system is such an absolute, bloody miracle.

4
00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:18.560
I can not figure out how in the world that idea ever came

5
00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:22.790
about and developed universal acceptance.

6
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.550
It's so unlikely. You know,

7
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.140
if you deal with people in a clinical setting and they're somewhat depressed,

8
00:00:30.141 --> 00:00:31.550
which is not uncommon,

9
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.070
and they've done something that they guilty about, independent of weather,

10
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.980
they've done something that they feel guilty about,

11
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.760
independent of whether they're actually guilty,

12
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.670
they to take themselves apart.

13
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.950
Now that's especially true if you happen to be high in trait neuroticism,

14
00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:55.070
which is one of the big five traits extroversion,

15
00:00:55.071 --> 00:00:58.490
which is a positive emotion dimension, neuroticism,

16
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.430
a negative emotion dimension, agreeableness,

17
00:01:01.431 --> 00:01:05.060
which is compassion and politeness conscientiousness,

18
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.300
which is orderliness and industrious and openness,

19
00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:12.590
which is intellect and openness, proper something like creativity.

20
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.020
If you're higher than normal in neuroticism,

21
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.780
it's very easy to take yourself apart.

22
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.460
If you're feeling guilty about something that you've done and people,

23
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.170
many people will feel guilty about what they've done at the drop of a

24
00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:28.760
hat. I mean, first of all,

25
00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:32.390
they accused themselves of their own shortcomings.

26
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.070
And then if they are accused by someone else, it's often very,

27
00:01:37.071 --> 00:01:41.330
very difficult for them to wow, their own defense, you know,

28
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.420
to believe in their own innocence. You know, cause you'd think, well,

29
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.780
the police come to your door or a mob comes for you,

30
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.790
let's say on Twitter and you know,

31
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.040
your stalwart sort of person and you pronounce your innocence.

32
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.120
And you know, you're, you're a brick wall. Nothing gets through that.

33
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.460
And that's just not how it goes, man.

34
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.730
If the mob comes from you for you on Twitter,

35
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.560
the probability that if you're a reasonably well socialized person,

36
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.760
that you're going to be wondering what you did wrong,

37
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.860
how you should apologize and what you should do to put yourself back in the

38
00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:23.300
good graces of the community is extraordinarily high. You know,

39
00:02:23.301 --> 00:02:27.320
because while you probably have done some things wrong in your life and you

40
00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:29.390
probably are guilty about this and that,

41
00:02:29.391 --> 00:02:32.450
and perhaps you didn't conduct yourself perfectly.

42
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.560
And so it's very difficult for you to Mount your own

43
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.810
defense, to presume your own inner innocence and Mount your own defense,

44
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.860
which by the way,

45
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.750
is why it's a very good reason to have a lawyer.

46
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.900
And one of the things I would say I'm dead serious about this.

47
00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:55.310
I've worked with legal cases a lot and learned a lot about the limitations

48
00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.640
and lack thereof of police ability to question

49
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:01.720
you for example,

50
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.820
and if you're ever accused of something

51
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:07.870
serious,

52
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.910
then do not talk to the police until you

53
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:17.830
have a lawyer because you will definitely get yourself in

54
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.920
all sorts of trouble. And so you might think, well,

55
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:23.110
if you're innocent and the police will tell you this too,

56
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.820
then you have nothing to be afraid of.

57
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.650
Of course that's complete bloody rubbish because you always have something to be

58
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:33.250
afraid of and innocence and guilt are relative things.

59
00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:34.990
And they're not that easy to determine.

60
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.130
So don't be so sure that you can defend yourself,

61
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.650
especially for reasons we'll go into,

62
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.270
but also don't be so sure that you don't need someone who's professional to

63
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:48.250
stand sort of outside of you.

64
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.350
And to look at you like an individual among other individuals and to adjudicate

65
00:03:53.351 --> 00:03:57.190
your relative guilt or innocence in that manner, you know,

66
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.810
in our legal system, you're actually not required to be perfect.

67
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.280
And thank God for that.

68
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.410
What you're required to be is reasonable and like

69
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.070
a reasonable, and let's say somewhat normative human being.

70
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.330
You're not required to go above and beyond the duty with regards to heroism.

71
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:19.810
For example, I was involved in a court case.

72
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:24.670
It was quite a terrible case where a woman was up on trial for murder.

73
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.870
And she happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.

74
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.640
Shall we say she was in a motorhome,

75
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:36.370
in a junkyard waiting for her boyfriend. And

76
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.610
she happened to walk out of the motor home just as a gang was killing

77
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.390
an enemy, I guess an enemy gang member with, with rocks, very,

78
00:04:49.391 --> 00:04:50.260
very brutal.

79
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.920
And they stripped her naked and told her that they would rape her and that they

80
00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:55.390
would kill her child.

81
00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.490
She had one child unless she participated in the murder. And so she did,

82
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.440
and she ended up dropping a rock on the unfortunate gentleman's

83
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.230
head, although by all appearances,

84
00:05:08.231 --> 00:05:11.680
he was well on the way to being dead at that point.

85
00:05:11.681 --> 00:05:14.830
And at that point in Canada, the law was,

86
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.360
there was no excuse for participating in homicide, regardless of the,

87
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.070
what would you call a ameliorating preconditions?

88
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.260
But they did decrease her culpability substantially because they

89
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.640
believed there was genuine reason for her to believe that her life was

90
00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:38.500
threatened and that she was going to be subjected to sexual assault and

91
00:05:38.501 --> 00:05:40.960
that her child, I don't think they did threaten her child,

92
00:05:40.961 --> 00:05:45.220
but they did certainly threaten her child with no longer having a mother.

93
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.590
So, um,

94
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.940
and then in case we can get involved in very terrible things.

95
00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:55.030
And it's very difficult for us to defend ourselves.

96
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.980
You need a lawyer to do that.

97
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.970
And so that's a good piece of practical advice and I would strongly

98
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:06.320
recommend that you follow it. If you ever happen to find yourself in trouble,

99
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.030
it's also the case.

100
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:12.860
If you find yourself in trouble at work or on

101
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:14.570
social media, you know,

102
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.640
it's hard to sit and remind yourself that you deserve

103
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.500
the benefit of the doubt and then to try to make a coherent case for

104
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:28.340
that. One of the things I often did for my clients

105
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.590
who were in trouble at work for one reason or another often,

106
00:06:33.591 --> 00:06:36.590
because well, for a variety of reasons,

107
00:06:36.591 --> 00:06:40.370
sometimes because they hadn't done everything they should have at work,

108
00:06:40.371 --> 00:06:43.490
you know? And so they carried some burden of responsibility for that.

109
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.900
But sometimes because there were people who were genuinely malevolently

110
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.890
predisposed towards them, bullying them in terrible ways.

111
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.760
And they just weren't good at mounting their own defense,

112
00:06:55.761 --> 00:06:57.830
which was also one of the things by the way,

113
00:06:57.831 --> 00:07:00.140
that made them prone to being bullied.

114
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.670
And so we would work for hours on at least hypothetically

115
00:07:04.671 --> 00:07:08.930
outlining a story that involved the

116
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:13.430
possibility that the person who was being accused.

117
00:07:13.431 --> 00:07:18.140
So that would be, my client was actually innocent of the charges, you know,

118
00:07:18.141 --> 00:07:20.930
and that, that's something that's useful to do for yourself.

119
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.460
If you ever run into trouble, it's,

120
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.970
you don't have to believe that you're innocent to begin with,

121
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.620
but you could make the strongest case possible that you

122
00:07:30.621 --> 00:07:34.430
are right, because everyone's entitled to a strong defense.

123
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:39.260
And then just see how that flies, you know, see if it's coherent.

124
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.410
I mean, you could make the opposite case too, just so you know,

125
00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:44.960
what you might be in for, but, you know,

126
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.430
we have an adversarial system for a reason. And part of the reason is,

127
00:07:49.431 --> 00:07:53.510
is that one of the easiest ways to get at the truth in so far as that's

128
00:07:53.511 --> 00:07:58.100
possible, and that's not an easy thing is to attack, you know,

129
00:07:58.101 --> 00:08:02.780
with a certain degree of intensity and viciousness and defend

130
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.740
with a certain degree of intractability and, and,

131
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.580
and coherence. And you need both of those.
