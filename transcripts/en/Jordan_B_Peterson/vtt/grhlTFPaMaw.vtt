<v 0>Hi,</v>

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.260
this is the first of a 12 part series of short videos based on my new

3
00:00:07.261 --> 00:00:11.220
book beyond order 12 more rules for life.

4
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.950
Each video features one of the rules as well as a paragraph from the

5
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:18.690
chapter. Based on that rule

6
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.210
rule one do not carelessly denigrate,

7
00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:27.750
social institutions or creative achievement.

8
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.260
This paragraph is from a section entitled.

9
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.360
What should we point to it is worth considering deeply just how

10
00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:41.070
necessity limits the universe of viable solutions and implementable

11
00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:43.440
plans. First,

12
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.850
a plan must in principle solve some genuine problem.

13
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.800
Second,

14
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.690
it must appeal to others often in the face of competing plans or those

15
00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:57.960
others will not cooperate and might well object.

16
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.690
If I value something,

17
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:05.400
therefore I must determine how to value it so that others

18
00:01:05.401 --> 00:01:09.720
potentially benefit. It cannot just be good for me.

19
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.700
It must be good for me and the people around me and even that is not enough,

20
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.120
which means that there are even more constraints on how the world must be

21
00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:22.500
perceived and acted upon the manner in which I view and value the world.

22
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.570
Integrity associated with the plans I am making has to work for me,

23
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.650
my family, and the broader community. Furthermore,

24
00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:36.060
it needs to work today in a manner that does not make a worst house of tomorrow

25
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.100
next week, next month. And next year, even the next decade or century

26
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.070
a good solution to an important problem must be repeatable without

27
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:49.500
deterioration across repetitions,

28
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.340
Iterable in a word across people. And across time,

29
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.800
these universal constraints manifest biologically and imposed

30
00:01:58.801 --> 00:02:03.060
socially reduce the complexity of the world to something approximating a

31
00:02:03.061 --> 00:02:06.240
universally understandable domain of value.

32
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.760
This is exceptionally important.

33
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.720
Although there are an unlimited number of problems,

34
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.290
as well as an unlimited number of potential solutions.

35
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.840
There are a comparatively limited number of solutions that work practically,

36
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.680
psychologically and socially simultaneously

37
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.530
the fact of limited solutions implies the existence of something like a natural

38
00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:35.790
ethic. Variable, perhaps as human languages are variable,

39
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.220
but still characterized by something solid and universally recognizable at

40
00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:42.054
its base.

41
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.950
It is the reality of this natural ethic that makes thoughtless denigration of

42
00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:51.060
social institutions, both wrong and dangerous, wrong,

43
00:02:51.061 --> 00:02:54.930
and dangerous because those institutions have evolved to solve problems.

44
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:57.630
That must be solved for life to continue.

45
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.340
They are by no means perfect,

46
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.530
but making them better rather than worse is a tricky problem. Indeed.

47
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.350
And order will be available in print and audio format March 2nd, 2021,

48
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.860
but can be pre-ordered before that details can be
