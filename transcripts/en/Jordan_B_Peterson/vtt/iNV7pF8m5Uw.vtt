00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.643
<v 0>Hi,</v>

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.180
perhaps you are viewing this video because you are in fact looking for a last

3
00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:07.014
minute gift.

4
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.400
Perhaps you also know someone to whom you would like to give that gift.

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.170
Who's familiar with my work.

6
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.270
You might also be aware that I have a new book coming out on March 3rd,

7
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.300
2021 beyond order 12 more rules.

8
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.243
<v 1>For life.</v>

9
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.970
<v 0>Beyond order can be pre-ordered. At many booksellers,</v>

10
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.070
you can find a list of them by country and corporation.

11
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.790
On my website, Jordan B peterson.com.

12
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.450
The more precise URL is listed in the video's description.

13
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.320
If you would like to pre-order this book as a gift,

14
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.600
you can download and print out a one page purchase announcement PDF

15
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.310
indicating that you have done.

16
00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:57.260
So that could be slid inside an envelope and delivered to the person to

17
00:00:57.261 --> 00:01:00.350
whom the pre-order delivery has been scheduled.

18
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.360
The PDF can be found@jordanbpeterson.com as well,

19
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.170
and a more precise URL for that is also in the video description.

20
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.720
So to recapitulate, you need to buy a gift. You know,

21
00:01:14.721 --> 00:01:16.280
someone interested in my work,

22
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.620
you pre-order the book from a bookseller listed on my website and have it

23
00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:23.030
delivered as a gift.

24
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.770
You print out the purchase announcement on my website and send it to the gifts.

25
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.720
Eventual recipient here is a one paragraph selection

26
00:01:32.721 --> 00:01:33.740
from beyond order.

27
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.420
This is from the first chapter rule one do not casually

28
00:01:38.421 --> 00:01:42.140
denigrate social institutions or creative achievement.

29
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.030
It's from a section called the utility of the fool.

30
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.890
It is useful to take your place at the bottom of a hierarchy.

31
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.820
It can aid in the development of gratitude and humility,

32
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.550
gratitude. There are people whose expertise exceeds your own,

33
00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:04.130
and you should be wisely pleased about that.

34
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.930
There are many valuable niches to fill given the many complex and serious

35
00:02:08.931 --> 00:02:10.550
problems that we must solve.

36
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.380
The fact that there are people who fill those niches with trustworthy skill and

37
00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:19.220
experience is something for which to be truly thankful,

38
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.510
humility.

39
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.330
It is better to presume ignorance and invite learning than to assume sufficient

40
00:02:26.331 --> 00:02:29.390
knowledge and risk the consequent blindness.

41
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.010
It is much better to make friends with what you do not know than with what you

42
00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:37.400
know, because there is an infinite supply of the former,

43
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.310
but an all to finite stock of the ladder.

44
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.710
When you are tightly boxed in or cornered all too often by your own stubborn and

45
00:02:45.711 --> 00:02:49.190
fixed adherence to some unconsciously worshiped assumptions,

46
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.850
all there is to help you is what you have not yet.

47
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.713
<v 1>Yeah, learned.</v>

48
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.370
So that's a sample paragraph beyond order.

49
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.450
<v 0>Which can be pre-ordered now from the booksellers on my website.</v>

50
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.710
And if you like given as a gift, uh,

51
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.760
thank you. Happy holidays.
