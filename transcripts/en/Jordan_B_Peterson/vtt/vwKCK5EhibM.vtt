00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.163
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.540
<v 1>So I think I'll tell you what I've</v>

3
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.820
learned over the last year.

4
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.320
Um, I've traveled to

5
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.430
about 160 cities since last January with

6
00:00:37.431 --> 00:00:40.070
my wife damning and, and, uh,

7
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.350
spoken to about 300,000 people of live events.

8
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.420
And so the first thing I learned was that for some reason,

9
00:00:50.421 --> 00:00:55.340
I can travel to 160 cities and speak to 300,000 people.

10
00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.770
And that was a shock in itself that it's a continual

11
00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:04.430
shock that everywhere we go,

12
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.740
there's a massive hunger for

13
00:01:09.741 --> 00:01:14.150
whatever it is that I happen to be talking about. And,

14
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:16.161
you know,

15
00:01:16.161 --> 00:01:21.050
I think about that constantly when I'm discussing what I'm discussing with

16
00:01:21.051 --> 00:01:25.100
my audiences, trying to understand what it is that's

17
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.330
driving this. Um,

18
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.390
I do that a variety of ways. You know,

19
00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:35.120
one of the things I do is listen for silence.

20
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.130
If you have 3,500 people in the auditorium

21
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.820
and they all fall dead silent,

22
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.270
what that means is that you've touched on something of,

23
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.910
that's a universal importance in that moment, anyways,

24
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.260
because if it's supersedes the topic supersedes,

25
00:01:57.261 --> 00:02:00.080
anything else that's being considered, right?

26
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.380
It's supersedes the desire to shift your position in your chair,

27
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.610
supersedes the desire to whisper to your neighbor. It,

28
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.530
it grips your attention completely and, and forces the silence.

29
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.140
And it's a very interesting thing to, to,

30
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.160
to listen for that because you see that people are in the grip of something

31
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.400
and then you have to puzzle out what it is that they're in the

32
00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:29.234
grip of.

33
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.080
I can tell you some of some about that. Um,

34
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.310
you know, there's this idea that became very popular in the 1960s.

35
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.430
I just talked to Bishop, uh, Bishop,

36
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.620
Bishop Barron about a week and a half ago for my YouTube

37
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.460
video channel and for my podcast. And

38
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.740
I told him that I was a strange psychologist because I never told my audiences

39
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:02.710
that now I speak to individuals in the audience.

40
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:05.530
I never tell someone that they're okay, the way they are, you know,

41
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:08.710
there's this idea that came up in the sixties, that you're okay.

42
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:13.260
The way you are. Yeah. And well,

43
00:03:13.261 --> 00:03:17.940
I like that idea very much. And I think it's a very bad idea,

44
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.820
especially,

45
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.680
especially when you're talking to young people who are lost and nihilistic and

46
00:03:22.681 --> 00:03:26.970
depressed and suffering and aimless and ideologically

47
00:03:26.971 --> 00:03:29.880
possessed and prematurely cynical,

48
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.550
because they're not okay the way they are. And if you tell them that they are,

49
00:03:35.551 --> 00:03:38.580
then they think, well, this is it, that's it that's life. It's like,

50
00:03:38.581 --> 00:03:42.450
I've hit the pinnacle at 18. I don't know anything about the world.

51
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.890
I haven't contributed anything to it, but there's no op because I'm okay.

52
00:03:46.891 --> 00:03:51.540
The way they are, the way I am. It's like, you know,

53
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.360
okay, the way you are, especially if you're 18,

54
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.320
you've got 60 years to put yourself together and you better,

55
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.440
you better be better at the end of that than you were at the beginning or

56
00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:03.510
something has gone seriously wrong.

57
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.740
And so it's not an optimistic thing to tell people that they're okay,

58
00:04:07.741 --> 00:04:09.810
the way they are. It's a pessimistic thing,

59
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.040
because what you do is denigrate what they could be for what ER,

60
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.580
and I know that is a terrible idea.

61
00:04:17.581 --> 00:04:20.940
Technically speaking from a psychological perspective,

62
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.890
because it's who you could be that imbues your life

63
00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:28.680
with meaning it's not the only thing. I mean,

64
00:04:28.681 --> 00:04:32.160
you have your friends and your family, but they expect something from you too.

65
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.410
You know, they expect the best from you.

66
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.130
They expect a certain amount of improvement, especially if you have children,

67
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.200
but even if you're are a child,

68
00:04:40.201 --> 00:04:44.400
you might expect some improvement from your parents as well. Um,

69
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.230
but that's what you hope for is you hope that the person can manifest what's

70
00:04:49.231 --> 00:04:52.350
best in them. And if they don't do that,

71
00:04:52.351 --> 00:04:55.290
then you're disappointed in them just like you would be

72
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.600
inexorably or are inexorably disappointed in yourself.

73
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.730
If you don't manifest what's best in you.

74
00:05:02.731 --> 00:05:07.680
And I think that that's very moral law. No.

75
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.113
Um,

76
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.790
I talk a lot to my audiences about what I believe to

77
00:05:14.791 --> 00:05:16.920
be in controvertible facts.

78
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.570
And I think that the fundamental in country,

79
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.090
or in controvertible fact is that life is suffering.

80
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.950
And I think that that's why that's a primarily primary

81
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.080
Axiom of religious belief in some sense,

82
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.160
almost regardless of the faith and the life is suffering.

83
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.920
And everyone knows that,

84
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.780
although they don't necessarily like to admit it or to talk about it. I mean,

85
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.770
you don't have to scrape beneath the surface very far in someone's life to find

86
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.120
a tragedy.

87
00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.260
If the person that you're with doesn't have something pretty

88
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.460
awful happening to them, right at the moment,

89
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.270
economically or socially or within their family or physically or mentally,

90
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.280
the probability that someone they love has a problem of that sort is

91
00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:14.330
extraordinarily high.

92
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:18.680
And if you happen to be among the fortunate minority for whom that isn't true,

93
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.580
well, all you have to do is wait and it will be true

94
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:29.060
soon enough and sooner than you think and worse than you imagine.

95
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.960
And so, and everyone knows that.

96
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.530
And so it's easy to understand

97
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.980
why people become cynical and bitter and hurt and

98
00:06:42.981 --> 00:06:47.570
nihilistic. I think there's a progression in life.

99
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.530
You know, if you're naive, you think that

100
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.550
life will be easy and that people are basically good.

101
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.690
And then you have some experiences if you're not sheltered too much,

102
00:06:59.691 --> 00:07:04.490
and that gets taken away from you because you betray yourself or

103
00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:06.050
other people betray or,

104
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.040
or you encounter a tragedy and then your negativity is shattered.

105
00:07:10.041 --> 00:07:13.700
And the most likely place that you'll go from there is into something

106
00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:15.260
approximating cynicism,

107
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.030
because you don't know the alternative and your initial faith,

108
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.790
which was not faith, but naive.

109
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.610
It is shattered by the terrible reality of what you encounter.

110
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.820
And then you, as a cynical person,

111
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.970
you're more wise than you are as a naive person.

112
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.410
And then that's a strange thing because you're worse in some sense than you

113
00:07:36.411 --> 00:07:38.360
were, you know,

114
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.860
you're not as optimistic and you're not as filled with hope and your life is

115
00:07:42.861 --> 00:07:43.730
more difficult.

116
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.780
And you're probably harder on other people and with more of a tendency towards

117
00:07:47.781 --> 00:07:50.270
cruelty. And none of that seems positive,

118
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:54.470
but there's a wisdom in cynicism that the naive lack,

119
00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:00.680
but the problem is there that cynicism is not a

120
00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:04.730
useful antidote to let's say,

121
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:06.440
tragedy and malevolence,

122
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:11.060
because there are places that you go past cynicism as you approach

123
00:08:11.061 --> 00:08:14.390
wisdom and it's wisdom that you need

124
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.410
in order to fabricate yourself,

125
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.820
this sort of vessel that will keep you afloat during

126
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.090
stormy times.

127
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.820
And so I talked to my

128
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.640
audiences about wisdom

129
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:40.060
and I think I tell them other things that I believe to be true.

130
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.490
It's like, well, life is difficult,

131
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.920
mean it's tainted by malevolence and it's cast and

132
00:08:50.921 --> 00:08:51.754
tragedy,

133
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:57.330
and you need something to offset that because otherwise they'd embitters you.

134
00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:59.310
And if you're embittered,

135
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:03.780
then you become vengeful and cruel inevitably,

136
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:09.210
and then you make everything that's made you worse, worse in turn.

137
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:13.950
And there's no bottom to that. You know, as, as anyone who's Steven him,

138
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.300
moderate student of history soon comes to understand,

139
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.930
well, there's an idea that hell is a bottomless pit.

140
00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:25.050
And the reason for that is that there's no situation.

141
00:09:25.051 --> 00:09:29.490
That's so terrible that there isn't some fool thing that some idiot can do that

142
00:09:29.491 --> 00:09:33.960
will make it far worse. And it's reasonably probable.

143
00:09:33.961 --> 00:09:34.794
That you're that.

144
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:45.560
And so the question is what might constitute an alternative to that?

145
00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:50.000
And if there is an alternative and you know,

146
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:54.080
I learned a while back a long while back reading religious mythology,

147
00:09:54.081 --> 00:09:58.940
mostly that there's a difference between thinking

148
00:09:58.941 --> 00:10:02.960
and paying attention and of the two paying attention is much more important.

149
00:10:02.961 --> 00:10:06.800
It's not the same thing as thinking like when you pay attention,

150
00:10:06.801 --> 00:10:09.080
you're looking for what you don't know. Like you,

151
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.580
you kind of detach yourself and you watch and you listen and you see if things

152
00:10:13.581 --> 00:10:15.710
are the way you think they are and you,

153
00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.470
you hope they are because life is easier. If,

154
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:22.880
if things are the way you think they are, but if you find out that they're not,

155
00:10:22.881 --> 00:10:24.560
and you're paying attention, then you can,

156
00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:28.220
you can weave and you can Bob and you can adapt and you can learn.

157
00:10:28.221 --> 00:10:31.970
And so you have to learn to pay attention. And

158
00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:38.150
I just ask people when I'm speaking to pay attention to what they

159
00:10:38.151 --> 00:10:40.370
already know,

160
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:46.610
here's something that everybody knows, No,

161
00:10:46.611 --> 00:10:50.810
in a world that's consists of suffering and malevolence,

162
00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:55.460
who is it that you admire, or who is it that you don't admire?

163
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:59.540
Those are the same question. If you know who you don't admire, well,

164
00:10:59.541 --> 00:11:02.930
then you have a negative model and you can go for the opposite.

165
00:11:02.931 --> 00:11:05.780
And if you know who you admire, well, then you can copy that.

166
00:11:05.781 --> 00:11:09.680
And the instinct for admiration is an instinct for imitation.

167
00:11:09.681 --> 00:11:12.620
And we're very imitative creatures. And

168
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:15.703
our,

169
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:20.090
our instinct for admiration is the instinct for imitation.

170
00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:24.500
And what would you call it deeply? Biologically admitted,

171
00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:29.810
physically rooted guideline to the proper path of life. The question is,

172
00:11:29.811 --> 00:11:33.500
is there a proper path of life? Well,

173
00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.170
there are certainly pathways that make things worse.

174
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.280
That's something to know you could avoid those.

175
00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.600
And if there's something that if there are pathways that make things worse than

176
00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.030
there, there, there are the opposite pathways,

177
00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.020
even though those might not be so clear, I think that's why we're often.

178
00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.590
So enamored of, of evil characters in,

179
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:56.950
in fictional representations is because it's clearer.

180
00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.750
It's easier in some sense to make what constitutes the dark path clearer.

181
00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.340
It's easier for people to understand,

182
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:07.840
whereas the path that's positive is murkier and more difficult to

183
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.480
ascertain, but at the very least, you know,

184
00:12:10.481 --> 00:12:14.650
it's the opposite of that say, well, who do you admire?

185
00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.060
Or we could start by who don't you admire? Well,

186
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:24.610
you don't admire an adult who won't take responsibility for himself

187
00:12:24.611 --> 00:12:26.620
or herself. And could, you know,

188
00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:31.180
I understand there are people that are so broken and hurt that they need

189
00:12:31.181 --> 00:12:35.050
help constantly because they can't take responsibility for themselves,

190
00:12:35.051 --> 00:12:38.650
or they can in small ways, but not, not completely,

191
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.370
but you don't admire someone who won't take responsibility for themselves.

192
00:12:42.371 --> 00:12:44.650
In fact, you have a sense of contempt for that.

193
00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.600
And if you happen to be that person,

194
00:12:46.601 --> 00:12:49.330
then you'll wake up in the middle of the night and berate yourself with what's

195
00:12:49.331 --> 00:12:53.800
left of your conscience for failing to undertake your moral duty,

196
00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:59.190
intrinsic moral duty. And you can't escape that.

197
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.650
And that's so interesting. No,

198
00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:05.160
that you can't escape that if you were the creature who could invent your own

199
00:13:05.161 --> 00:13:09.720
values, as Nisha suggested as an antidote to the death of God,

200
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:14.340
then you just forgive your transgressions and you wouldn't suffer the bitter

201
00:13:14.341 --> 00:13:16.860
pangs of conscience, but you do.

202
00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:21.900
And the reason you do is because you're doing things that are wrong and you

203
00:13:21.901 --> 00:13:25.080
should stop. And you know, it, maybe you can't

204
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.720
and then, well, let's say then the opposite, isn't it.

205
00:13:30.721 --> 00:13:34.680
You admire someone who can take responsibility for himself or herself.

206
00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:38.580
That's a start. And then maybe you admire someone even more.

207
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:43.860
If they've forged their character sufficiently to move past cynicism so that

208
00:13:43.861 --> 00:13:47.760
not only they take responsibility for themselves,

209
00:13:47.761 --> 00:13:51.360
but they can take responsibility for their family. No. And,

210
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:55.860
and they're there for the people who love them

211
00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.120
when it's necessary. And if you do that,

212
00:14:00.121 --> 00:14:04.200
then you have something I wouldn't say necessarily to be proud of,

213
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:08.730
but at least you have one less thing to upgrade yourself with

214
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:14.850
not something. And then you can move past that.

215
00:14:14.851 --> 00:14:16.230
And you can say, well,

216
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:21.360
maybe if you put yourself together enough,

217
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:26.760
carefully enough spoke the truth enough. We're courageous enough. In,

218
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.440
in spite of the reasons you have not to be that you could also be

219
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.580
someone of benefit to yourself and your family and your community.

220
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:40.380
You partake in structuring things in a harmonious manner

221
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:45.210
by living in that way. It's, it's, uh,

222
00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:50.130
it's not an individual focused ethos.

223
00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:55.010
It's an ethos of harmony among levels. You should do.

224
00:14:55.011 --> 00:14:56.600
What's good for you, but it has to be,

225
00:14:56.601 --> 00:14:59.240
what's good for your family at the same time. And it has to be,

226
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:02.330
what's good for you and your family and your community at the same time.

227
00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:06.770
And that works musically. You know, it makes all the levels work in harmony.

228
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.710
And, and you can tell when that's happening.

229
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:14.630
And this is another thing that's a great utility to note is that when you're in

230
00:15:14.631 --> 00:15:19.370
that place where you're acting in the proper manner and you're facing

231
00:15:19.371 --> 00:15:22.580
things courageously, and you're speaking the truth,

232
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:28.280
you're imbued with a sense of fundamental

233
00:15:28.281 --> 00:15:29.150
meaning.

234
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:34.790
And that meaning is the antidote to the catastrophe of life. And it's,

235
00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:39.710
it's the antidote psychologically because you have to have that meaning because

236
00:15:39.711 --> 00:15:44.570
otherwise your life is too dark and too dreadful, and it will corrupt you.

237
00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:47.270
So it's the end to dote psychologically,

238
00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:52.430
but it's also the antidote practically because we're not nothing

239
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:55.130
us human beings. You know,

240
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.390
they say that we're made in the image of God.

241
00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:01.460
It's hard to say what that means,

242
00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:06.230
but it means at least in part to participate in the process

243
00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:08.720
of bringing the good into being,

244
00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.390
and we can all do that and the opposite.

245
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:16.910
And if we accept our responsibility to ourselves

246
00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:22.250
and to other people and to our communities, and we lift that load up,

247
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:25.280
then we live lives that are meaningful.

248
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:28.160
And that stops us from being corrupt hit.

249
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:33.380
It provides us with a medication against catastrophe and it also

250
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.590
practically improves the world.

251
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:40.640
That's the other thing it's not just psychological it's,

252
00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:44.510
you can make things worse. Everyone knows that.

253
00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:47.420
And no doubt you have in many ways,

254
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.350
but you can make things better and they actually get better.

255
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:53.300
And there's reason for hope.

256
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.590
And there's something to be said to know that you're the sort of creature that

257
00:16:57.591 --> 00:17:01.850
can look mortality and catastrophe and

258
00:17:01.851 --> 00:17:04.160
malevolence straight in the eye,

259
00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:08.810
so to speak and nonetheless stand up and do what's

260
00:17:08.811 --> 00:17:12.950
right. And that all there is in that

261
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:19.040
is good. And that's what I've been telling people.

262
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:23.060
Thank you very much.

263
00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:41.080
