1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.770
<v 0>It just seems unfathomable that an entire app that's used by a hundred</v>

2
00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:06.930
million users across America,

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.490
and that's only America not across the entire world would have the possibility

4
00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:14.490
of being banned. That's insane. However,

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.440
my mom sends me so many news articles and I read about it

6
00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:24.150
so much and people just like the news. Y'all the news. They just be saying like,

7
00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:25.050
it's coming tomorrow.

8
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.060
<v 1>We're looking at TechTalk. We may be banning tech docs in less than one year.</v>

9
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.000
We have almost 35 million followers on Tik TOK.

10
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.210
It's one of the most popular social media apps out there.

11
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.720
[inaudible] hi everyone. My name is Betsy. See my ad. Is that just that fee?

12
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.420
And I'm a comedian slash Mike yeller.

13
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.290
<v 2>Hello. My name is Sean Sitara, Donna from Shonda's magic and I make combi.</v>

14
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.540
<v 0>Hey, I'm Allen chicken chow. My ad is Alan chicken chow and I make comedies.</v>

15
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.910
<v 1>Hello. My name is Hilda.</v>

16
00:01:10.911 --> 00:01:14.090
My aunt has put Tilda tomorrow and I'm all about self love,

17
00:01:14.091 --> 00:01:16.940
baby and storytelling. Hi, my name's Ashley.

18
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.860
My username is pithy and Festus and I frequent which talk and a cult talk.

19
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.580
I utilize my great Danes. I'm a bathroom.

20
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.710
I am nervous about a potential Tik TOK ban,

21
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.890
The first take top gear ban or whatever I want to alive or whatever.

22
00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:49.280
I was like, I was crying so much

23
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.900
on my Instagram. I was,

24
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.000
I was a wallet and it was so embarrassing.

25
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.730
My friends looked like screenshots of me crying and stuff like that.

26
00:01:58.731 --> 00:02:03.620
It was so bad. But at that point in time is when I was like burst growing fast.

27
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.230
Like I was growing fast and I was like, kind of nervous. Cause like,

28
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.950
I'll put in all this hard work just for it to be taken away. Yeah.

29
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.220
My first reaction to I like took the tech talk and I like, it was almost,

30
00:02:13.221 --> 00:02:16.670
I put my bootstraps on and I was like, they can not take us down. You guys,

31
00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:20.240
they will not touch us. I went in for a second and I don't know.

32
00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:22.130
What I kind of realize is with our brands,

33
00:02:22.131 --> 00:02:25.160
especially people who have developed an emotional connection with us enough that

34
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.390
they'll find us afterwards. Also, where were these thoughts, words,

35
00:02:29.391 --> 00:02:31.550
ideas come from. They can't just die.

36
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.360
<v 2>Me. Uh, first and foremost, I honestly have a lot of faith and Tik TOK.</v>

37
00:02:35.361 --> 00:02:37.550
I think that they're actively working hard. I mean,

38
00:02:37.551 --> 00:02:41.090
they're not going to just let go of this gigantic app. You know,

39
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.250
if tick-tock goes away today, like,

40
00:02:43.251 --> 00:02:46.010
I feel like I feel confident in not just myself, but like all of us,

41
00:02:46.011 --> 00:02:49.010
we're going to find a platform somewhere else and we're going to thrive in that

42
00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:50.720
platform. So that's why I don't,

43
00:02:50.721 --> 00:02:53.590
I don't really feel like any nervousness or pressure.

44
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.470
<v 0>My professional answer is that I completely agree with that.</v>

45
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.840
I think conceptually, like there is no basis for this band to go through Tik.

46
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:04.750
TOK is like a huge, huge tech company.

47
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:09.490
It just seems unfathomable that an entire app that's used by a hundred

48
00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:14.110
million users across America and that's only America not across the entire world

49
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.190
would have the possibility of being banned. That's insane.

50
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.210
However,

51
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.160
my mom sends me so many news articles and I read about it

52
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:28.870
so much and people just like the news. Y'all the news. They just be saying like,

53
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:30.970
it's coming tomorrow. And I'm like, Oh my God,

54
00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:34.780
like my apartment is going to be gone at this. Like, no.

55
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.350
<v 1>I spent seven years in the air force.</v>

56
00:03:37.351 --> 00:03:41.160
And a big thing that we all have to do is we have like requirements for security

57
00:03:41.161 --> 00:03:42.000
and stuff like that.

58
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.100
The big tell for me is that tick-tock is banned on government devices,

59
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.250
not personal devices for the military members.

60
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.180
So it was really that big of a security risk.

61
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.850
They would have had a bad audit for personal use as well.

62
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.690
We have things that are blacklisted every day when they have actual evidence

63
00:04:00.691 --> 00:04:02.430
behind them. And if they're not banned,

64
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.800
if we're still making tick talks on deployment,

65
00:04:04.801 --> 00:04:06.210
we're still doing it here and there.

66
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.370
I don't see where the substantial evidences anyone can get tech talk

67
00:04:11.371 --> 00:04:12.204
famous.

68
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.130
<v 3>I feel like it's easy to go viral, but to like maintain a fan base,</v>

69
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.280
they got a really mash up energy. They gotta put you if they're not,

70
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.160
then you're just not fun to keep getting used.

71
00:04:29.161 --> 00:04:34.050
Like it's just not going to happen. I think that it was a lot easier when we,

72
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.000
before the algorithm change one, they look for the first three seconds movement.

73
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.390
And if you don't move, you're not going to get on FYP page.

74
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.490
Your lighting is incredibly important as well as like being able to

75
00:04:47.491 --> 00:04:48.510
engage your audience.

76
00:04:48.511 --> 00:04:52.530
So the way that the Ted talk algorithm decides whether or not your video will

77
00:04:52.531 --> 00:04:56.340
continue to get used, it's only through rewatch now. Not through likes,

78
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.540
not through comments and not through.

79
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.300
<v 2>I also feel like it's kind of relative. Um,</v>

80
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.490
I feel like in terms of like Tik TOK thing, cause like,

81
00:05:02.491 --> 00:05:06.150
no one's tried to touch on like Charlie familiar, like the upper, like 1%,

82
00:05:06.151 --> 00:05:07.770
like I think like, you know what I mean?

83
00:05:07.771 --> 00:05:10.740
Like a couple hundred thousand people that like really rock with you, um,

84
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.160
is manageable. And I also feel like it, like, I completely agree with you.

85
00:05:14.161 --> 00:05:17.070
Like it is a thousand percent about authenticity, but because of that,

86
00:05:17.071 --> 00:05:20.820
anyone literally anyone can get to talk famous. If you have like a niche,

87
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.970
if there's something you're passionate about, Tik TOK has an audience for it.

88
00:05:23.971 --> 00:05:26.490
And I feel like that's, what's different compared to any other platform.

89
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.680
If you compare to YouTube, it's so hard to grow on YouTube.

90
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.820
So you even Instagram, like there's not very much organic growth, but I mean,

91
00:05:32.821 --> 00:05:36.120
like take talk, you post one video, you could get a hundred thousand followers.

92
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.850
My attractiveness plays a role.

93
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.290
<v 1>And my success,</v>

94
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.840
the years I spent,

95
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.830
I'm going to be someone I wasn't on Instagram and doing my makeup up and all of

96
00:05:52.831 --> 00:05:55.170
those things, it wasn't until I said like,

97
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.040
so I took off the makeup now I just don't.

98
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.610
<v 4>Give up. Like, and that those were the videos at first started popping up.</v>

99
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.530
<v 1>It is a component that can help creators. I mean, there are, you know,</v>

100
00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.300
girls and guys who, you know,

101
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.530
they're shopping literally just stand in front of a camera and can get millions

102
00:06:11.531 --> 00:06:14.500
of views. Um, not my case,

103
00:06:14.501 --> 00:06:18.580
but if I didn't have my personality nor nor my own,

104
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.130
like my own talent, I wouldn't be in the position I am today.

105
00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.180
<v 0>I think it does help. Like if, if your intention is to be like a trapper,</v>

106
00:06:25.181 --> 00:06:30.070
which by the way is like a very viable option for many people. And like,

107
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.370
you can have success. I mean, even outside of tech talk,

108
00:06:33.371 --> 00:06:38.290
like there are celebrities like actors and singers who literally sell

109
00:06:38.291 --> 00:06:41.580
that. That is like all they are. So it is a big selling point. If you,

110
00:06:41.581 --> 00:06:42.780
if you want to go that.

111
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:48.280
<v 4>I think looking different, uh, takes a big role on it.</v>

112
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.700
Cause like, I look pretty mobile right now, but I had like green hair.

113
00:06:51.701 --> 00:06:55.300
Then I had pink and I had blue and red and all types of colors and that kind of

114
00:06:55.301 --> 00:06:58.750
drew attention towards me, like matching your hair with your eyebrows.

115
00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:00.130
And like you get more compliments,

116
00:07:00.131 --> 00:07:03.070
which gets people to see your videos and like start liking you.

117
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.113
Cause you're different.

118
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.540
So I think if you don't look like other people or you have your own type of

119
00:07:07.541 --> 00:07:11.260
style to yourself, that's different. That definitely plays a role too.

120
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.860
<v 3>I totally agree with you. I think that there's been like a big movement.</v>

121
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.280
If you look different, like there's, mid-size tech talk,

122
00:07:18.281 --> 00:07:22.270
which is what I'm a part of. I am not average size. I'm not plus size,

123
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:27.520
but people being able to see my very small five foot compact

124
00:07:27.521 --> 00:07:31.480
body is what they like to see because it reminds them of like,

125
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.100
everyone is different.

126
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.530
<v 1>That does add to your attraction is like, you know,</v>

127
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.140
how to your personality attraction, isn't all looks.

128
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.840
I think attraction is kind of like the whole package and, and yeah,

129
00:07:40.841 --> 00:07:41.710
it definitely like

130
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.410
what attracts you to somebody like it could be anything they could smell nice.

131
00:07:47.411 --> 00:07:51.550
And it would be an attractive thing. I can fully support myself with money.

132
00:07:51.551 --> 00:07:52.870
I make off tech talk.

133
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.870
<v 3>I personally don't make a lot of money through the app, but I do.</v>

134
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:09.400
I am able to funnel customers and clients through tech talk,

135
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:13.720
but I don't make money through tech talk, the creator fund for me. Um,

136
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.060
I've only made like $20 off of it.

137
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.050
So all of my support does not come from the internet.

138
00:08:20.051 --> 00:08:21.880
I actually have two regular jobs as well.

139
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.800
<v 5>Wow. I'm nowhere close to supporting myself fully off and pick doc. Um, I,</v>

140
00:08:26.801 --> 00:08:30.220
I, I made a couple of bucks off of that talk creator fund,

141
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.030
but then my views also started to dip and I don't know if that was,

142
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.600
I'm just like tuning it or whatnot,

143
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.000
or if it's because like now we're paying any preview,

144
00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:39.160
your content has to be like top tier.

145
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:43.720
I think you could ultimately end up supporting yourself through other avenues,

146
00:08:43.721 --> 00:08:45.310
like starting your own business.

147
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.850
<v 4>Like dedicated myself to doing that.</v>

148
00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.460
Then I could make it happen some way shape or form,

149
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.490
but I'm like really helping people at the capacity that I am right now.

150
00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:56.010
Then I'm, I'm.

151
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:56.910
<v 6>Personally emotionally.</v>

152
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.430
<v 4>Like I'm thriving. I live with my sister, so I don't pay rent.</v>

153
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:03.120
So I don't have to worry about rent, but like if I do have a job,

154
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.950
I work at target, but if I didn't work there,

155
00:09:04.951 --> 00:09:09.150
I felt like I could like get the stuff that I need and stuff like that.

156
00:09:09.151 --> 00:09:11.160
Cause I do like get brand deals and stuff like that.

157
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:12.990
Like this wig is a promotion. Video is free.

158
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.650
I don't have that many things that I need though. Like I'm not living by myself.

159
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:21.030
I don't pay for my car. So it's like in my lifestyle,

160
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.920
what I do need, I could.

161
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:28.160
<v 0>Like make the leap of quitting my full-time job going without money for like</v>

162
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:33.160
three months in order to be able to actually now like literally now

163
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:37.280
be able to like, like, um, to sustain myself.

164
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:41.060
It's definitely crazy to be able to do it. Um, but yeah,

165
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.390
I'm grateful for the, for, you know, the, the freedom.

166
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:48.500
<v 2>I'm in like a really interesting boat because I started to talk last year and I</v>

167
00:09:48.501 --> 00:09:52.370
was, um, you know, a junior in high school. So I just graduated this year, um,

168
00:09:52.371 --> 00:09:57.080
a high school. So I've actually never had like a quote unquote real job, um,

169
00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.470
besides, you know, like social media or whatever, anything. Um,

170
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.710
but it wasn't until, you know, this year that I actually started to, you know,

171
00:10:03.711 --> 00:10:06.500
make money and, um, it was, you know, through the live streams,

172
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:10.490
through brand deals, through, um, branded opportunities. Um, and you know,

173
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:15.140
now I'm able to, you know, I moved out and I have my own place now and uh,

174
00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.680
all all through Tik TOK. So I'm very blessed. I'm very grateful for everything.

175
00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.520
<v 0>Tuck community feels safe.</v>

176
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.850
<v 6>Who's accidentally ended up on a porn site.</v>

177
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:36.590
I've had like multiple videos that have been taken off of multiple social media

178
00:10:36.591 --> 00:10:41.060
platforms that people then go and upload to PornHub or X videos

179
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:42.440
I'm fully clothed.

180
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.980
I don't really ever do things in like a sports bar or a bikini or whatever.

181
00:10:45.981 --> 00:10:50.660
It's just not my thing, but yeah. How did you find them? Um,

182
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.780
I had a follower of mine who

183
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:59.810
messaged it to me and they're like, Hey, um, you know, you're on porn up.

184
00:10:59.811 --> 00:11:01.580
And I was like, I am. And they're like, yeah,

185
00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.430
you've got like a a hundred percent rating right now. And I was like, wow,

186
00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:09.170
where's my cut. Like where's my money. Come on. So,

187
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:12.020
um, yeah, I accidentally became a porn star.

188
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.110
<v 2>Or you page it's very particular to you, you know,</v>

189
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:18.500
you're rarely going to find a video that you strongly disagree with with that,

190
00:11:18.501 --> 00:11:20.150
the comments and all of the, you know,

191
00:11:20.151 --> 00:11:23.330
kind of the community and the vibe going around is like, you know,

192
00:11:23.331 --> 00:11:27.860
it's going to be relatively the same as yours. Um, and I compare that to like,

193
00:11:27.861 --> 00:11:29.390
when I G uh, sorry,

194
00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:32.930
Instagram released IgE reels when they released reels,

195
00:11:32.931 --> 00:11:36.290
like I was looking through the comments and they're just way harsh or then

196
00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:43.340
there's so much like just compared to, um, to Tik TOK.

197
00:11:43.341 --> 00:11:47.330
So, um, in that, in that respect, um, yeah, I feel like it is, you know,

198
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.870
somewhat, somewhat pretty safe. Um, there are definitely instances where,

199
00:11:50.871 --> 00:11:51.670
you know, like we've,

200
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.910
we've seen like with a lot of drama and stuff where it can get really toxic and,

201
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.350
um, like, you know, not the best space for, uh, for users influencers and,

202
00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:01.660
you know, just like the kids in general who consume this content.

203
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:04.840
But in general, I think, I think tick-tock has done a pretty,

204
00:12:04.841 --> 00:12:07.330
pretty decent job on keeping a safe community.

205
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.850
<v 3>I've experienced both a lot of negativity and a lot of positivity.</v>

206
00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.730
Somehow one of my videos, um,

207
00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:18.810
ended up on straight tech talk and I got body shamed really hard.

208
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:23.850
And I was like, this is not what I'm used to. I also,

209
00:12:23.851 --> 00:12:28.590
as a spiritual minority, I get a lot of hate.

210
00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.270
I get a lot of clown emojis.

211
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:35.040
I get called a psychopath I've been called mentally ill. Um,

212
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.940
so I actually use common blockers now to make sure that that kind of stuff

213
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.100
doesn't, um, filter through,

214
00:12:41.101 --> 00:12:45.300
especially because I work really hard to try to keep a safe space for people who

215
00:12:45.301 --> 00:12:49.770
are curious about spirituality and they don't need to see people who,

216
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.860
who are gonna put you down for X self exploration.

217
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.610
<v 1>I feel in competition with other creators.</v>

218
00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.050
<v 4>I'm like a comedian, a Mike yeller. I do all this like funny stuff.</v>

219
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:10.500
So there's so many people who do what I do. And it's like crazy.

220
00:13:10.501 --> 00:13:12.060
And like a specific tech talker.

221
00:13:12.061 --> 00:13:16.380
He wanted to like block me and call me out for stealing his content when I never

222
00:13:16.381 --> 00:13:18.240
saw him in my entire life. And like,

223
00:13:18.241 --> 00:13:21.450
we even talked about it and he still posted our stuff about me.

224
00:13:21.451 --> 00:13:22.620
So I was just like, okay.

225
00:13:22.621 --> 00:13:25.920
So I felt like at some point I was competing with him cause we were doing the

226
00:13:25.921 --> 00:13:29.970
same thing and our followers were like picking sides, choosing. So like,

227
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.130
that's like the personal experience I had.

228
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.210
<v 3>Spirituality is not a competition. So in that way,</v>

229
00:13:36.211 --> 00:13:40.050
I think my niche of Tik TOK, uh, it's a little bit less competitive,

230
00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.750
but maybe not necessarily not dramatic.

231
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:48.120
The Wichita community has this awful reputation being called witch toxic because

232
00:13:48.121 --> 00:13:52.800
there's a lot of infighting and it really hurts to

233
00:13:52.801 --> 00:13:57.180
see people who try to attack each other over something like personal beliefs.

234
00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.180
Uh, I think that that's really silly.

235
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:05.100
I also would like to say that not every person is going to like everybody and

236
00:14:05.101 --> 00:14:09.510
that's okay. So if I have never act on the people that I disliked,

237
00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:10.980
I simply block and move on.

238
00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:12.230
<v 2>I personally believe that, you know,</v>

239
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:16.020
there's so much opportunity in this world for everybody. So like, um, you know,

240
00:14:16.021 --> 00:14:18.840
just because someone else succeeds or is doing well doesn't mean, you know,

241
00:14:18.841 --> 00:14:21.930
you can't either. So I don't ever see as like, you know, a competition it's,

242
00:14:21.931 --> 00:14:24.570
you know, it's my own personal gain. And if someone else has done well,

243
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:27.510
all power to you, you know, a good job, that's all you.

244
00:14:27.511 --> 00:14:29.790
And there's so much more opportunity for everybody else.

245
00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.840
<v 1>I think my content makes a difference in people's lives.</v>

246
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:42.750
I get a lot of messages from like parents,

247
00:14:42.751 --> 00:14:46.710
a little kids that just broke their back or just broke their neck.

248
00:14:46.711 --> 00:14:49.980
Or they were born with CP and they're like going through their school years.

249
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.100
They didn't want to do, they didn't want to do.

250
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.580
<v 6>That. And they stopped me driving my truck with hand controls and they're like,</v>

251
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:59.360
mommy, I want to drive a truck like that. I thought I could only have a minivan.

252
00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:03.500
I'm able to like show them a whole new world that a lot of people don't think

253
00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:04.490
could even exist.

254
00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.680
<v 4>The fan pages I have, or like the DMS or like the, um,</v>

255
00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.890
comments on Tik TOK. They really do mean a lot. I just wanted to say,

256
00:15:11.891 --> 00:15:14.290
I love you so much. You brighten my day.

257
00:15:14.291 --> 00:15:17.350
Like hearing them physically say that is just something different.

258
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.090
<v 3>Right? Seeing the things I've struggled with,</v>

259
00:15:19.091 --> 00:15:20.890
and maybe me not speaking directly on them,

260
00:15:20.891 --> 00:15:24.790
but maybe the energy or just collectively the things I'm saying, adding up.

261
00:15:24.791 --> 00:15:26.860
And then it translating with people.

262
00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:30.250
One of the things I've kind of always dealt with in the last, like, you know,

263
00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.280
throughout my journey and self-love and eating disorders and all of this stuff

264
00:15:33.281 --> 00:15:34.300
is like looking in the mirror.

265
00:15:34.301 --> 00:15:37.330
And that was always a really big thing for me that just in seeing a super

266
00:15:37.331 --> 00:15:39.420
distorted version of myself, um,

267
00:15:39.421 --> 00:15:41.890
and I got a video from a girl not too long ago and it was her speaking.

268
00:15:41.891 --> 00:15:45.190
So like Duchess C said about really hearing it. That's so different.

269
00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.200
This girl said that she stared in her.

270
00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:51.700
She stared at herself in the mirror for 30 minutes and saw how beautiful she was

271
00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:55.420
after watching my videos. It's perfect. I'm so happy with what I with.

272
00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:58.810
I don't know if Tik TOK were to go tomorrow, whatever happens.

273
00:15:58.811 --> 00:16:01.660
I'm so happy to be where I'm at and be doing what I'm doing.

274
00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:06.100
I'm excited to go make a video after this.
