WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.710
<v 0>We make assumptions about people all the time. It's not necessarily a bad thing,</v>

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.910
but how often are we actually right about the assumptions we make and how often

3
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:13.170
are we right about the assumptions other people make about us to find out.

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.350
We decided to put someone in the hot seat and have 100 strangers,

5
00:00:16.351 --> 00:00:21.300
rate them one to 100 based on various levels of first impression in doing so we

6
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:24.510
would hopefully be able to see how different ways of communicating could

7
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:28.830
drastically change the way we perceive others. Welcome to one-to-one hundred.

8
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.070
<v 2>Hi everyone. My name is DJ Cornado. Um, I'm a college student.</v>

9
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.250
I'm 20 years old and I also am in a fraternity.

10
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.110
What would you rate yourself? Uh,

11
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.810
I'd give myself like a high B,

12
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.700
so probably like 87 for intelligence. Yeah. Alrighty.

13
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.700
Yeah. Our first group is just going to be looking at you.

14
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.940
I don't know if I come off as, as an intelligent person, I guess we'll see.

15
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.790
It really depends on the questions that they asked me and stuff like that. So

16
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.450
Can you show what kind of pants you're wearing? If you're wearing pants,

17
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.430
are you wearing underwear? Can we see your closet? Can we see your clothes

18
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:35.683
Organized?

19
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.890
The faculty had fiercely present him,

20
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.560
made him feel like he was more into,

21
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.690
rather than academics. He looked sweet and like, you know,

22
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.660
typically like whenever you like, see people in classes, you're like, Oh,

23
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.330
this person is smart and he didn't have glasses,

24
00:01:56.331 --> 00:01:58.130
but like he still looked like he was like.

25
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:17.300
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

26
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.940
<v 2>Uh, I think, I think I took a hit, uh,</v>

27
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.390
when they all saw kind of like the frustrated flag at the end. Um,

28
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.120
but like other than that really, really nice people. I liked it.

29
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.790
<v 1>Well, yes, yes.</v>

30
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.930
<v 2>Oh, we ain't got that many pictures. That's all right.</v>

31
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.050
<v 1>Oh, he's been to Barcelona.</v>

32
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.950
<v 2>He is very independent. Yeah.</v>

33
00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.160
Independent because he only got like one to like, not to Pepperdine though.

34
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.640
That don't mean nothing, but this one doesn't have any of the, um, activism,

35
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:08.080
posts, Adrian.

36
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.300
[inaudible] just travels.

37
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.890
<v 3>To me. Um, if someone's traveling, especially if they're in college,</v>

38
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.390
all that means to me is they have the means to travel. Like there's no,

39
00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:26.100
like depths like that picture. It was like answer ban with a capital D again.

40
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.890
<v 2>Well, I would hope that he, you know,</v>

41
00:03:28.891 --> 00:03:31.170
he has a lot of knowledge because since he travels so much,

42
00:03:31.171 --> 00:03:34.590
I would hope that he knows the culture and it's not just for show.

43
00:03:34.591 --> 00:03:38.580
And he did travel a lot and he seems like someone who is way up going.

44
00:03:38.581 --> 00:03:42.090
So I would assume that he knows a lot about different cultures and how different

45
00:03:42.091 --> 00:03:42.630
people work.

46
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.890
<v 3>It was pretty like deeply rooted and everyone's experiences,</v>

47
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.940
whether they want to call it or not on how they perceive having the means to

48
00:03:50.941 --> 00:03:53.400
travel and, um,

49
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.760
prioritizing travel over like studying or an internship.

50
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.350
I would have scored him higher if there were more social justice posts.

51
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.470
<v 1>We're to.</v>

52
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.730
<v 3>We'll move on to the next section, then conversations over voice.</v>

53
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.730
Hi Sam. Hi. Hi, my name is David. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, David.

54
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.150
Um, what are you? So, yeah, um,

55
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.300
I'm a student of integrated marketing communications, um,

56
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.260
at Pepperdine university in Malibu. All right, cool. What's your GPA?

57
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.690
My GPA is a 3.7 right now, so yay. Okay. Okay.

58
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.100
Where did you actually go? I went to Wheaton college in Chicago.

59
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.780
<v 2>Um, but now I'm a law student.</v>

60
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.500
<v 3>And you get your news from, um,</v>

61
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.730
it just really depends. I try and honestly do BBC,

62
00:05:08.731 --> 00:05:11.100
just because I feel like they're the least bias. Um,

63
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.310
I don't really like bleed reading, uh, politically charged, uh,

64
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.250
articles from either spectrum. So yeah,

65
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.100
I get a lot of news from BBC for sure. Um,

66
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.280
so what do you think about like COVID and, uh,

67
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.360
like Trump's administration trying to like silence of data and like yeah.

68
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.890
Try and all that. Yeah. I, I don't agree with it whatsoever. Um,

69
00:05:31.891 --> 00:05:36.090
I think everyone needs to be wearing a mask, a self quarantining. Um,

70
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.560
do you have any hobbies? Yeah, hobbies. Um, I love reading. Um,

71
00:05:40.561 --> 00:05:43.260
I love reading anything from nonfiction or fiction.

72
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.230
What would you say is your favorite book? That's the great Gatsby.

73
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.790
That was just my favorite. Growing up.

74
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.870
<v 2>You have very good taste. Great.</v>

75
00:05:48.871 --> 00:05:51.530
Gatsby is actually my favorite book as well as for my whole life.

76
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.030
<v 3>Oh man. I hate the Greek guy. Oh, well.</v>

77
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.690
Where do you prioritize most in your life? Um, I would say family, you know,

78
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.250
I wouldn't be where I am without them. Um, so I'm a very family oriented person.

79
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.490
What do you think denotes,

80
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.410
like someone who is truly intelligent? Um, I think that,

81
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.440
you know, it's not so much just academically, you know, if you're,

82
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.930
if you're book smart, uh, quote unquote, book smart.

83
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.160
I don't think that's a true judgment, uh, intellect at all. I think, you know,

84
00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.870
a real judgment would be, um,

85
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.990
whether or not that person applies himself to whatever they're passionate about

86
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.360
and are able to problem solve throughout their journey.

87
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.390
<v 4>Even a pretty high score,</v>

88
00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:36.160
because I was able to have a conversation with him about what his work

89
00:06:36.161 --> 00:06:36.700
was.

90
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:41.650
And he said that he was in a business field and I feel like that involves a

91
00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:42.730
lot of education.

92
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.410
<v 3>We talked a lot about, um,</v>

93
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.400
his education experience and just the way he talked about it.

94
00:06:48.401 --> 00:06:53.170
He was very confident, but not in like a arrogant way, I guess.

95
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:28.900
Hi. Hi. How are you? Good, good. How are you? I'm good. I'm Darien.

96
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.410
Nice to meet you, Darien. My name is David virtual and virtual handshake,

97
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:37.450
virtual handshake. So I started, yeah,

98
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.170
of course. Thank you. Or done your dreams.

99
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:46.240
I dreams. Um, I hope to one day own my own marketing firm. Um,

100
00:07:46.241 --> 00:07:48.760
I would say that's probably like my 15 to 20 year dream.

101
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:53.890
I believe you can do so much. I appreciate it. Do you know,

102
00:07:53.891 --> 00:07:58.870
like your States and capitals? Um, I can name all the States.

103
00:07:58.871 --> 00:08:00.430
I don't know about every single capital,

104
00:08:00.431 --> 00:08:02.440
but I can name every state what can be broken,

105
00:08:02.441 --> 00:08:06.730
but it's never how well it can be broken, but it's never held, um,

106
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:13.630
spirit a promise. Promising was people.

107
00:08:13.631 --> 00:08:16.600
I do feel that you connect well with people like you very easily,

108
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:21.220
or like sometimes it's really hard to, yeah, I would say I,

109
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.730
uh, you know, a blessing and a curse. I run my mouth 24 seven,

110
00:08:24.731 --> 00:08:27.400
so I just get talking. And so hopefully, you know,

111
00:08:27.401 --> 00:08:30.670
that makes other people kind of more comfortable to be able to communicate with

112
00:08:30.671 --> 00:08:31.504
me as a person.

113
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:33.730
<v 4>It has to happen for change.</v>

114
00:08:33.731 --> 00:08:35.770
Like it was something you could suggest it could make a change.

115
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.500
<v 3>Um, I think it starts with, you know,</v>

116
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.770
this newer generation teaching the generation after us,

117
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.190
what ideals we should have as Americans. And that, you know,

118
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.090
that if you believe that there isn't a problem with racism in America right now

119
00:08:49.091 --> 00:08:52.090
that you're completely wrong because there is a problem. Um,

120
00:08:52.091 --> 00:08:55.680
so I think the ultimate change would definitely be this generation taking

121
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.390
accountability for, you know,

122
00:08:57.391 --> 00:09:01.920
the older generations actions and passing those ideals that we want our children

123
00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:06.150
to have in the next generation. So, yeah. All right. And that is two minutes.

124
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:07.670
Yes, sir.

125
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:11.900
<v 2>A hundred for me is like someone who is already great.</v>

126
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.130
Like they are already thinking outside of just themselves and just the things

127
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.370
they learned in walks, they are able to grow.

128
00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.750
They kind of seemed nervous when I was talking to him and asked him a question.

129
00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.140
And I think like he was just talking really quickly.

130
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:31.220
So I didn't really see him as that intelligent.

131
00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.610
<v 3>So I think that, you know, a camera or not, like,</v>

132
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.150
I think when I was able to actually communicate back and forth with the person,

133
00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.930
um, that they, you know, found value in that. Um, and I think that, you know,

134
00:09:59.931 --> 00:10:02.090
my social media appearance and, um,

135
00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.990
just my general like room appearance and just me without talking. Um,

136
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.290
I don't think that was too bad, but it didn't really show who I was as a person.

137
00:10:09.291 --> 00:10:12.560
So yeah, if you can guess within three points,

138
00:10:12.561 --> 00:10:17.330
either direction of the average score you got today based on the

139
00:10:17.331 --> 00:10:20.930
interactions you had, then you win $100. Oh, wow.

140
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.440
Okay. Um, I'd go with,

141
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:28.370
I'm going to say 86.

142
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:36.400
<v 1>Oh.</v>

143
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.760
<v 3>Wow. Okay. Interesting. What do you think,</v>

144
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.790
um, caused the disparity? Um,

145
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.280
I think it was definitely maybe the first two groups. Um,

146
00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:50.840
I definitely saw that like the fraternity thing came into play and I knew that

147
00:10:50.841 --> 00:10:52.100
was going to happen. Um,

148
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.740
hopefully I kind of broke that stereotype a little bit today.

149
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.120
<v 2>Looking back at it,</v>

150
00:10:56.121 --> 00:11:01.070
I feel like I judged him a little bit too harshly and I feel like everyone

151
00:11:01.071 --> 00:11:04.790
else did as well because it's social media.

152
00:11:04.791 --> 00:11:08.150
And I think we were being pessimistic instead of optimistic.

153
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.100
What would you rate yours?

154
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:14.910
<v 1>Oh, like a 20.</v>

155
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:21.050
<v 2>If he knows better as a marketing major, he should know how to sell himself.</v>

156
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.330
Essentially. He didn't have photos with friends.

157
00:11:23.331 --> 00:11:25.610
He didn't have photos with animals, pets.

158
00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.570
He wasn't posting about all of the horrible things we could have going on in the

159
00:11:29.571 --> 00:11:33.080
country right now, which we need to be talking about. He's just like, yeah,

160
00:11:33.081 --> 00:11:37.670
here's the, my favorite shots of me in Italy. I definitely get.

161
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:42.290
<v 3>That fraternity and I guess, stories, um, aren't really, uh,</v>

162
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:45.860
seen as like the brightest on campus and whatnot. Um, as in terms of like,

163
00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:48.350
you know, stereotypes among Greek life and whatnot,

164
00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.300
I think they're all pretty justifiable. I mean,

165
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.440
hopefully I was able to kind of change a little bit of the stereotype least for

166
00:11:53.441 --> 00:11:58.180
myself. Um, and yeah, like I overall love the experience. I,

167
00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:00.070
um, appreciate everyone for.

168
00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:01.950
