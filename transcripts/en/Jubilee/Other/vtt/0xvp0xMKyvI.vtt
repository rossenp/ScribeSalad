1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.580
<v 0>Yeah. I don't know what to say, but just tell me what song you like better,</v>

2
00:00:02.581 --> 00:00:05.310
never too much, or a house, not a home from Luther Vandross.

3
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.860
<v 1>Mike is black. Mike is black without seeing someone.</v>

4
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.810
How can you tell if they are black and white,

5
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.640
when you ain't black through their name,

6
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.310
through their knowledge of black television shows,

7
00:00:16.311 --> 00:00:19.670
black movies and black culture, is it their voice?

8
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.160
We brought together six black people and one secret white person with no

9
00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:27.830
cameras. Can they find the odd man out?

10
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.410
<v 2>My questions would be experiential, but one sticker,</v>

11
00:00:33.411 --> 00:00:38.360
white person will probably be a white person who knows R and

12
00:00:38.361 --> 00:00:39.380
B. Who knows the class.

13
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.100
<v 3>You got to want to learn. I'm going to figure it out</v>

14
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.020
is telling a fib just based off of how they're communicating with us.

15
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.370
Hopefully that works. It might not work today.

16
00:00:52.371 --> 00:00:54.380
I'm just going to be asking like mostly,

17
00:00:54.381 --> 00:00:58.550
very popular black pop culture questions. I'm just going to be,

18
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.670
to look for like a little generic stereotypes. And most people associate,

19
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.660
because I feel like the mold is going to try to play some, you know, black,

20
00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:09.650
stereotypical things. I'm just gonna start calling people out. Hey everyone.

21
00:01:09.651 --> 00:01:13.220
My name is James Jessica, and my pronouns. Are he him? His I'm super,

22
00:01:13.221 --> 00:01:14.240
super excited to be here,

23
00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:17.600
but also obviously very nervous and not really planning on using this strategy.

24
00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:20.360
I'm just going to be me. Um,

25
00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:23.360
I just have like a inappropriate profile picture at the moment.

26
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.270
<v 1>This moment that he knew he.</v>

27
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.800
<v 0>Oh God, Oh, camera's black. I would say that.</v>

28
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.390
<v 3>Really quickly. We can't figure out where the mall is.</v>

29
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.460
<v 2>Where we're all from. Someone's from San Francisco.</v>

30
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:45.980
<v 0>I can't tell him, you know,</v>

31
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.110
I like Karen. Alrighty. Okay.

32
00:01:54.111 --> 00:01:55.910
The conversation is going to lowland. Come on, guys.

33
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.120
They asked about black is King. I see. I don't have that.

34
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.600
<v 2>Where are everyone's period?</v>

35
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.210
<v 3>No, I didn't do that. We're going to ask you this. I shouldn't watch a movie,</v>

36
00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:10.940
but see, I don't have a district money.

37
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.570
Parents from the parents from.

38
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.130
<v 2>Black is King. I honestly don't know what black is. Black is.</v>

39
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.080
<v 0>Wait a second.</v>

40
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.920
<v 2>Cami. So she started Jamaica.</v>

41
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.500
<v 0>I'll be really mad if they're lying about being from Navy.</v>

42
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.870
<v 3>People from Dubai, do they consider themselves? But Karen's thinking now,</v>

43
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.300
Karen don't do this to me. That I were to say,

44
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.810
my parents are from Ireland and Poland and it's, it's, it's a, it's an obvious,

45
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.963
um,

46
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.340
the layers of blackness genes. And that is time.

47
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.470
<v 2>That round one round.</v>

48
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.490
<v 3>One was tough. Oh my God. That was so hard on this round.</v>

49
00:02:58.491 --> 00:03:02.110
I felt kind of okay. Um, I was just trying to be super casual with it.

50
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:03.580
I think we were all just kinda chatting.

51
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.600
It didn't feel like anyone was like aiming Porsche in person or camera

52
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.690
cameras. I'm gonna say James.

53
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.730
<v 1>I think I'm going to vote Micah. Okay.</v>

54
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.530
<v 3>I'm going with Micah because everyone else changed their mojo to black.</v>

55
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.090
Thinking about Cameron. Cameron.

56
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.120
<v 1>I don't know. Kevin sounds like a white name, so I'm just going to vote.</v>

57
00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:27.530
Cameron and Cameron has to go. The person eliminated.

58
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.390
<v 0>This round is Cameron.</v>

59
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.960
<v 3>Oh God. See? Okay. The game moves too fast. People don't think as fast as I do.</v>

60
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.190
That's probably why I'm out.

61
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.680
<v 0>How old is everyone? Oh, 21 years old at 19.</v>

62
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.790
I have a question in there.

63
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.570
<v 1>Forever. Why are you in Dubai? Full-time student.</v>

64
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.400
<v 0>Yo wait, Trevor. James is compensated. He be saying yo too much.</v>

65
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.510
<v 3>I have experienced racism. Jeans. He got every time you experienced racism.</v>

66
00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.873
Oh.

67
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.630
<v 0>Oh, he said no BS. Let's go.</v>

68
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.620
<v 3>Obviously, no one finished. I mean like I don't really get fetishized. Um,</v>

69
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:08.820
but it me off.

70
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.350
<v 0>I love being called articulate a question.</v>

71
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.340
I can relate to that. That not a given.

72
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.040
<v 3>Well, mine was runway skinny solo shop.</v>

73
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.190
<v 0>I did not.</v>

74
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.550
Who didn't answer.

75
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.090
<v 1>Mike has talked about being articulate charter service, Jeremy.</v>

76
00:04:30.091 --> 00:04:32.430
Some best often shot called him the N word and love.

77
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.000
<v 0>[Inaudible] just hit Netflix.</v>

78
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:46.860
<v 3>[Inaudible] this scrubbers.</v>

79
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.210
<v 1>Someone said her hair felt like this scrub.</v>

80
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.200
<v 3>Living single apps.</v>

81
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.430
Oh. Oh. I thought I thought they read like living like,

82
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.190
cause I'm single currently. Nope. Um,

83
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.160
to be honest and not the biggest sit-com.

84
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.810
<v 0>Teammates. James, I don't know.</v>

85
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.320
<v 1>James you're on my list.</v>

86
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.690
<v 0>How do y'all feel about princess and the frog?</v>

87
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.790
How do you type and talk and process so much

88
00:05:29.791 --> 00:05:34.680
stuff here? A couple of years, buddy. Now, LeBron James,

89
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.450
not LeBron James.

90
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.180
<v 3>I get what Disney was trying to do.</v>

91
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.600
I'm really happy about it.

92
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.040
<v 0>I'm mad. Cause she was a frog, never Disneyland.</v>

93
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.660
<v 3>So I know what you're talking about.</v>

94
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.310
Stop making characters into now.

95
00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.280
Why is our.

96
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.790
<v 0>One movie, us being an amphibian?</v>

97
00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:07.540
<v 3>What are we even talking about? And that is time.</v>

98
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.360
I don't want to drink it. So I'm going to I'll come in. Um,

99
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:11.350
I'm feeling a little more calm.

100
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.030
<v 1>James. When I mentioned, uh, nineties black TV shows,</v>

101
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.310
he said he's not made into sitcoms.

102
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.800
I haven't met a black person who didn't watch, you know,

103
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.070
sitcoms. So I'm going to vote for Trevor James prompt.

104
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.490
<v 3>In this round. I think I'm most suspicious of James.</v>

105
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.830
I guess I'm going to have to go with Trevor.

106
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.770
<v 0>Forever. I'm going to go with Trevor</v>

107
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.193
and I don't even know why.

108
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.730
<v 2>This round there is actually a tie. Oh my God.</v>

109
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:48.190
We love a good tie over here. So here we go. The tie is between

110
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.450
Trevor and Jane.

111
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.420
So what this means is you will now vote again between those two people,

112
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.340
Trevor and Jane.

113
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.150
<v 3>Which is in Trevor.</v>

114
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.970
Cause I chose him last time I voted for Trevor because I don't want to be out.

115
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.620
I know it's man and no issue. You're the one coming from me. I'm going to stick.

116
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.630
<v 1>With G. I'm.</v>

117
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.250
<v 3>Not convinced that it's strawberry.</v>

118
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.450
<v 0>On the other hand, we're going to go James. Sorry. I'm changing it up.</v>

119
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:24.340
I feel like Trevor wouldn't lie about someone calling him the N word and leaving.

120
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.900
<v 2>The person eliminated this round is.</v>

121
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.150
<v 3>Obviously like I'm a little I'm upset.</v>

122
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.180
I w I want to personally know why, what gave it away per se?

123
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.760
I mean like obviously, maybe like a ton of things did.

124
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.713
<v 0>The first time</v>

125
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.190
I brought out to the woods.

126
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:53.223
<v 1>For me.</v>

127
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.083
<v 3>Whenever.</v>

128
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.820
<v 0>My mom was holding or.</v>

129
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.530
<v 3>Jeez. All right, Brandon. Definitely.</v>

130
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:05.890
<v 0>My favorite line is it hurts you</v>

131
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:10.860
more than it hurts. My son, my favorite line is ever.

132
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.270
It hurts you more than it hurts me.

133
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:18.850
<v 3>It hurts me more than it hurts. No, it does. It really knows it. I don't know.</v>

134
00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.290
They're typing so fast.

135
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.880
<v 0>It's a secret. My person is still in here.</v>

136
00:08:21.881 --> 00:08:23.620
They're guilty of digital black things.

137
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:34.480
That is Oh, to say, okay, Brandon, Brandon is fine.

138
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:37.240
I'm still going with Trevor bro. There is no.

139
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:41.980
<v 1>And that's all facts. No, one's calling me.</v>

140
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:45.700
<v 0>How do you, Oh, how do you feel about white people in braids?</v>

141
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:49.991
Ooh, like honestly,

142
00:08:49.991 --> 00:08:54.280
Kim Kardashians did not do it first.

143
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.520
Oh, The most BS. Excuse.

144
00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.590
<v 3>Uh, wait his shoppers thing. Sorry.</v>

145
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.300
<v 2>Smart thing would be to vote for Trevor.</v>

146
00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:11.720
<v 0>Well, I'm going to just touch ya. Sorry girl.</v>

147
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.780
I think the person I'm going to go for is Trevor.

148
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.230
I think we're all black in here. I know Brandon's off the mall.

149
00:09:18.231 --> 00:09:20.660
I don't think Cassie has the mall. I don't think Cammie's the mall.

150
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.930
Which leaves rubber.

151
00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:31.010
<v 2>The person eliminated this round is Trevor.</v>

152
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.720
<v 3>It's soft to be eliminated.</v>

153
00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:40.220
I really thought that I was able to like try and show that I have experienced

154
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.840
the black experience and the black experience.

155
00:09:41.841 --> 00:09:44.540
I couldn't really talk and things like boxer briefs and stuff like that.

156
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.790
I don't know. Oxfords. I've never braided my hair.

157
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:51.410
<v 2>Give me a thumbs up. If you want to continue the game or thumbs down.</v>

158
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.100
If you think that you already caught them all.

159
00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.510
Alright so we will continue.

160
00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.010
<v 0>What would you even say?</v>

161
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.070
<v 2>I'm ready? My name is Brandon.</v>

162
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.730
I was actually in another jewelry video in the sixth stomach crosses one secret

163
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.713
or poker video.

164
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:15.350
And I was a guy who said I'm black and I'm off to still black right now. Yeah.

165
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.660
<v 0>I don't know what to say, but just tell me you fall. You like better?</v>

166
00:10:17.661 --> 00:10:22.640
Never too much. Or how it's not a [inaudible].

167
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:23.540
<v 2>Mike.</v>

168
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.910
<v 0>How are you guys? I'm Katsuya. I'll speak a little Creole.</v>

169
00:10:25.911 --> 00:10:26.870
So you know I'm black.

170
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:35.280
Vote me out. Hello? Hello?

171
00:10:35.281 --> 00:10:38.630
Hello? Uh, Cami's here. Um, let me speak Luca.

172
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:42.530
I don't know what else to say.

173
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:48.080
<v 2>I screwed up voting thinking. Micah might not have been a black person.</v>

174
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:49.850
I think we're all black at this point.

175
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.250
<v 0>Oh, what did I do? I said, let's talk about Luther Vandross. Why?</v>

176
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:57.200
And I hope y'all feel dumb.

177
00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.610
I hope y'all feel dumb because none of us were in the mall from the boys alone.

178
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:05.180
I'm more suspicious of Micah. I was so

179
00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:07.573
sure about,

180
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:14.570
and she has a yellow hand emoji, like why not use the black?

181
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:15.763
You know,

182
00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:25.850
if I'm wrong.

183
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:31.040
<v 2>I'm a vote for Micah. Just because that's the person I was suspicious of.</v>

184
00:11:31.041 --> 00:11:31.874
I'm sorry, Micah.

185
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:36.980
<v 0>I'm voting for Brandon simply because he was the first one to</v>

186
00:11:36.981 --> 00:11:37.814
put the thumbs up.

187
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:41.480
<v 2>The person eliminated this round is Mike.</v>

188
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:48.590
<v 0>I was really kicked out, honestly,</v>

189
00:11:48.591 --> 00:11:51.380
though, like I'm not even mad at them. Like I sounded stupid.

190
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.040
If the color.

191
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.400
<v 1>Turns green, you have won the game.</v>

192
00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.700
The color turns red.

193
00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:04.180
The mole is still in the game and you lose three,

194
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:06.820
two, one.

195
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:15.623
Beautiful.

196
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:23.490
You can reveal yourself three, two, one. Oh,

197
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.473
I'm so sorry.

198
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.470
I knew I want them all. I knew y'all went to the mall, but then y'all

199
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:42.330
just respect me. Like if I was a mole, I would have a black lives matter.

200
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:48.750
Your life matters to James James. He doesn't watch.

201
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:54.590
Yeah. Yeah.

202
00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.280
He could have saved yourself the same watch,

203
00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.840
fresh Prince of Bel air or something like that.

204
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:03.090
The fact that I was this close and all,

205
00:13:03.091 --> 00:13:06.990
because I couldn't find the thumbs up. I really like all of the Iowa.

206
00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.870
We just want to be all their friends. To be honest, I wanted to learn.

207
00:13:09.871 --> 00:13:13.410
I want it to be educated. I think it's important to, um, you know,

208
00:13:13.411 --> 00:13:15.060
as white people to continue educating,

209
00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:18.050
not by going to people and being like educating,

210
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:22.410
but like doing your own research and whatnot I learned from this experience is

211
00:13:22.411 --> 00:13:27.060
that there's not a set way or a certain way on how to be black because

212
00:13:27.061 --> 00:13:30.780
blackness is much more than just what meets the eye. Of course,

213
00:13:30.781 --> 00:13:33.720
we're all going to have our individual experiences.

214
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:38.640
But I think when you tap into those things that bring us together while also

215
00:13:38.641 --> 00:13:43.410
find your individuality, I think that's the most important part of blackness.
