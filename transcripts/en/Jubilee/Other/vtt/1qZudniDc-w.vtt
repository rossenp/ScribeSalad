00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.780
<v 0>[Inaudible] hopefully at the end of this challenge,</v>

2
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.900
the two of them are still going to be sleeping in the same bed. Excuse me,

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.130
not fiving. You got to get writing, not even a game anymore.

4
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.180
<v 1>Welcome to song lab,</v>

5
00:00:17.181 --> 00:00:20.990
a show where our talented song lead producers get paired up with musicians and

6
00:00:20.991 --> 00:00:23.840
have only two hours to create an original song.

7
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.380
The most voted salt will be the winner and the team will get a cash prize.

8
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.120
Get ready for song lab.

9
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.740
<v 0>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.880
<v 1>Hi everyone. We have here with us, our super talented song, lap producer.</v>

11
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.970
<v 0>What's up everyone. My name is Tara evergreen.</v>

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.990
I am a producer and I predominantly make vocal driven indie electronica. Hey,

13
00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:50.600
my name is Simon Zurvita and I'm a producer from Toronto, Canada.

14
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.490
I mainly do hip hop production right now.

15
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.860
<v 1>Then we brought two special musicians who also happened to be a couple.</v>

16
00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.383
<v 0>I see.</v>

17
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.600
<v 1>My name is Brian shin. I'm a singer song writer and yeah.</v>

18
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.660
<v 0>[Inaudible]. My name is Kayla [inaudible] and I am a recording artist,</v>

19
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.670
singer and songwriter.

20
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.710
My relationship with Kayla is fire.

21
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.810
I met him at a bar like three years ago and I was just like, Hey, you know,

22
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.050
I'm Kayla. He wasn't into it. Cause I guess I was too bubbly.

23
00:01:30.051 --> 00:01:31.130
And he was like real chill.

24
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.080
He fell in love with me after we both had a bottle of fantasy is a way better

25
00:01:36.081 --> 00:01:39.860
singer than I am. He can play multiple instruments and produced anything.

26
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.890
I do wish I could play an instrument. I did play the harp,

27
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.050
but I don't know how to play that no more. Actually. You know,

28
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.320
if someone brought a Harper round, do you guys live together?

29
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.320
He is in the other room. Yeah.

30
00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.050
<v 1>Well now we need to decide what the teams are going to be three, two,</v>

31
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.740
one. And the results are Brian.

32
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.670
You will be on team evergreen and Kayla you'll be on a team.

33
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.460
It's not even a game anymore for today. Song battle. That theme is

34
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.570
breakups. Mike let's go. Okay. Team Simon.

35
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.680
The three words for your teams lyrics are missing

36
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.570
jealous and ex team evergreen.

37
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.690
And the three words for your team's lyrics are here.

38
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.360
Regret and pain.

39
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.310
Each team will have two hours to create an original song with the theme of

40
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.080
breakups and use the selected three words in your lyrics that were suggested by

41
00:02:42.081 --> 00:02:46.100
our followers. I hope you all have fun and made the best songs.

42
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.290
<v 0>Hey, if anything happens, just go to his room and unplug his computer dude. That</v>

43
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.230
really ants, I haven't had any caffeine like for like the past week.

44
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.930
And then I just drank. Have you ever had a Yerba Hubei? Yes.

45
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.320
I want to take your hip hop influence in the beat and then I will carry it

46
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.310
vocally in an art, like in a nineties, R and B sort of a way. Yeah. Okay.

47
00:03:17.311 --> 00:03:18.480
I think we have to do the step by step.

48
00:03:18.481 --> 00:03:20.040
So let's get any chord progression down first.

49
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.850
What instruments sound do you like? I like the tar. Oh, that's perfect.

50
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.430
Cause I don't know how to do that. You don't okay.

51
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.520
T the words I have to include tear.

52
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.280
Yeah. I'm down to keep it pretty like minor and moody.

53
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.830
Beautiful. Love it. Hmm.

54
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.710
Can I just come what I just did to you? Yeah. Yeah.

55
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.110
That's that's the easiest option. Okay.

56
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.653
Sorry.

57
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:01.830
Yes.

58
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.380
Let's wake it up. Cause I know it's sleepy. Are you thinking,

59
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.350
okay, I'm getting, I'm getting what's going on. Maybe 95.

60
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.981
Wait,

61
00:04:28.981 --> 00:04:32.250
let me just add some hats for some groove and then I'll send this over to you.

62
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.510
It's so weird. Cause I can hear him. He's like already singing. That's crazy.

63
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.320
All these Volcker recording to start to scream.

64
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.770
No shade, no stress, no fear, no fade.

65
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.170
I'm honestly really excited about these scratch vocals.

66
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.710
Cause I already like have something cool that I'm going to do with them.

67
00:05:01.711 --> 00:05:05.700
And I'm excited to show you the idea just like hit me like that across the base.

68
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.480
[inaudible] second. Sorry. I think I burped in your ear.

69
00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:17.790
I apologize when I'm super nervous.

70
00:05:17.791 --> 00:05:21.240
I burp a lot and we're not talking by the way. This is on the internet.

71
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.873
I understand

72
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:41.243
crazy.

73
00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.560
It's taken me two weeks to write that I usually take forever,

74
00:05:46.561 --> 00:05:49.560
but we don't have times. Hey guys, how are you guys doing?

75
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.910
Awful. That just popped in give you guys a challenge. He,

76
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:58.543
yeah.

77
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.360
<v 1>Your team must incorporate a voice message to your song that was sent to us by</v>

78
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:03.223
our followers.

79
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.900
<v 2>And you were willing to do it, but I was a coward and I know that,</v>

80
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.920
but you don't know what is going on inside of me and that's okay.

81
00:06:11.921 --> 00:06:13.420
I'm stuck somewhere else.

82
00:06:13.421 --> 00:06:18.160
And I don't think you'll be able to understand later that this is the best

83
00:06:18.161 --> 00:06:20.050
decision that I could've made for us.

84
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.570
<v 0>Wow. Um, okay.</v>

85
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.680
<v 1>You don't have to use the whole memo, but you have to incorporate somehow. Okay.</v>

86
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.630
Good luck guys. And see you at the end.

87
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.930
<v 0>Thank you. Thank you. It was so sad,</v>

88
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.300
but I think we could keep the indie part where she's like,

89
00:06:37.301 --> 00:06:41.560
I made the best decision for me more than like, I'm sorry. I have to.

90
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.260
I'm not the girl we're writing for is not sorry.

91
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.200
<v 1>My instinct would be to chop it up and trigger it.</v>

92
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.200
Then it could be used kind of like where I would normally do add Linds or

93
00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:50.530
something.

94
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:51.760
<v 0>Let's move in that direction for sure.</v>

95
00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.950
You got to get writing. What are you doing? Stop, baby.

96
00:06:59.951 --> 00:07:02.470
You got to get right in fire. Okay. I'm out. I'm out.

97
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.100
[inaudible] I can't hear him. Huh?

98
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.590
X is the only word I have left. Okay. I'm just going to freestyle. I don't know.

99
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.310
The next time he'll be me. I'll keep you.

100
00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.630
Should I call Brian and I need help with those things. Okay. I'm.

101
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.090
<v 1>Going to get up. Need help.</v>

102
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.470
Okay. I just want to send him these harmonies. Explore.

103
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.810
<v 0>Thank you. Good. We're good.</v>

104
00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:00.250
It looks like we have 30 minutes left. Could you send me the hook? Oh,

105
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.100
you're saying bounce this out. I mean, if it's a convenient time,

106
00:08:03.101 --> 00:08:05.350
you know what I mean? Yeah. So here's the thing.

107
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.570
I think that bouncing it out is going to take too much time.

108
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.630
I'll share the tune with you so you can kind of hear where we're at and then

109
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.230
maybe get an idea. I'm just doing like layers and stacks and stuff.

110
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:18.780
If you can get that over to me within the next 10, that would be phenomenal then

111
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.330
[inaudible] it's not the right harmony, but it's fine. Let's see what happened.

112
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:26.680
How's it coming on your end.

113
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:53.320
You get Brian on some of those vocals over how much time did he say?

114
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.230
Five minutes. Ooh.

115
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.850
Can you say that one out? Simon? Which one? Can you take the bed next time?

116
00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:06.480
Harmony out. I can, I can fish. Correct? It is so annoying though.

117
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:11.370
If you want to, you got this. We got this right here. Ooh.

118
00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:13.950
It's going to get close. I said just delete it. It's okay.

119
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:31.280
<v 1>Yeah. Okay. Gotcha.</v>

120
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.260
<v 0>Okay. Not bad. I think the, I would just make the,</v>

121
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:38.623
I can't believe we did that.

122
00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.390
<v 1>The wave titled box too. Yeah,</v>

123
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.130
it would be the one that starts right at the beginning.

124
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:48.050
That's the first free and then box, hook, inbox, hook to,

125
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:52.100
uh, those can just start at the beginning of the hook. Yeah.

126
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.280
<v 0>Oh, I'm not getting less. I'm sorry.</v>

127
00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.690
I mean, I can share my screen, but we're going have time.

128
00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.660
What are we calling it again? I.

129
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.970
<v 1>Mean, we could call it, break up to break through. We.</v>

130
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:09.110
<v 0>Don't have a name for it yet. Oh my God. Oh God.</v>

131
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:16.220
Okay. I hate corny names.

132
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.520
Let's just call it jealous. How you feel?

133
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:25.430
I feel like I just blacked out for two hours. How are you feeling?

134
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:28.430
Where am I putting it? Oh. Oh, you're doing something. Nevermind.

135
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:33.440
Answer your question. It's a pretend years. I said, how are you feeling?

136
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.840
You doing good?

137
00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.640
<v 1>Yeah, this was, this was stressful. I don't know.</v>

138
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.830
Tell like time went a lot faster this time.

139
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.530
<v 0>You didn't know the song that well to not receive the book,</v>

140
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.700
the vocals from Brian until literally the very last minute. That was really,

141
00:10:46.701 --> 00:10:47.534
really tough.

142
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.600
<v 1>We did what needed to be done within two hours.</v>

143
00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.360
<v 0>I'd say we did a great job.</v>

144
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:54.920
<v 1>Everyone. Welcome back.</v>

145
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.490
I hope both teams were able to get everything done in two hours.

146
00:10:59.090 --> 00:10:59.923
Now's the fun part.

147
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.920
Let's listen to each other's songs and see what each team came up with.

148
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:06.290
Let's begin with team evergreen.

149
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:28.100
<v 0>[Inaudible] already. Oh man. I'm so nervous right now.</v>

150
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.000
I love the vocal mixing on this. Here we go.

151
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:02.283
[inaudible] okay.

152
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.513
Cool.

153
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.300
It's a bop, yo

154
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:32.220
so much great work on the house show. That was fine. I know it was weird.

155
00:12:32.221 --> 00:12:36.120
Like not really getting the chance to even show you that what,

156
00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.100
where the production had gotten to. So

157
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.080
he used to be

158
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.190
[inaudible]. You can keep your thoughts. I hate it.

159
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.173
I keep it

160
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:49.140
[inaudible] Oh my God.

161
00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:03.270
Oh, that was clean. I love those chord progressions.

162
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.870
You got pipes on you seriously. Yeah. She carried it.

163
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.110
<v 1>The songs are all amazing.</v>

164
00:14:10.111 --> 00:14:13.710
And props to all of you for pumping this out in two hours, which is crazy.

165
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:17.820
We have posted these songs online and people are already voting as we speak and

166
00:14:17.821 --> 00:14:20.550
let's find out which one of the two songs will be the winner.

167
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.680
<v 0>This might sound overconfident.</v>

168
00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:30.150
And I don't like sounding like that, but I do think we're going to win.

169
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:34.140
It just had a character to it. You know,

170
00:14:34.141 --> 00:14:37.620
the way that the sounds are picked and the way that it bounces and the way that

171
00:14:37.621 --> 00:14:41.460
the vocals are mixing, it was newer to recording our own vocals.

172
00:14:41.461 --> 00:14:42.540
And I thought she killed it.

173
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:46.650
<v 1>Now for the results. Both songs are very unique with their own flavor,</v>

174
00:14:46.651 --> 00:14:48.870
but there can only be one winner.

175
00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:52.610
The results are in and the song received the most votes.

176
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:57.710
The winning song for today's song lag is break up to break

177
00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:58.693
through.

178
00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:02.290
<v 0>Team evergreen, evergreen</v>

179
00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:05.740
I've been talking so much.

180
00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.470
I don't think we're going to win dear evergreen and Brian,

181
00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:13.270
they had an amazing song. So it was kind of undenying for the time that we had.

182
00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:18.460
I feel like we crushed it. It was kind of interesting seeing their rivalry.

183
00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:20.860
What's crazy. Is that because we could hear each other.

184
00:15:20.861 --> 00:15:24.730
I think that amped up the competitiveness. I was really happy with, uh,

185
00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:28.000
McKayla's production and it was just fun. I mean, I met with,

186
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:32.950
I said like you guys saw him was mad catchy you're all right.

187
00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:39.580
