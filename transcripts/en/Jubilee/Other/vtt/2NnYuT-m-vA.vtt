<v 0>Uh, dreaming.</v>

2
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.300
Let's go. I'm feeling the pressure today.

3
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.020
That was cool. What just happened? Oh my God.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.480
<v 1>Welcome to song lab.</v>

00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:36.350
have only two hours to create an original song.

7
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.160

Get ready for song.

9
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.490

<v 1>Hi everyone. We have here with us. Our amazing song left producers.</v>

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.860
<v 0>What's up everyone. My name is Mikayla. My artist's name is dear evergreen.</v>

12
00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:58.820
Hey guys. My name is Simon.

13
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.310
<v 1>I'm a producer from Toronto Canada. Today.</v>

14
00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:04.670
We brought two musicians from two very different genres.

15
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.550
<v 0>You said you don't want to go that way. I'm not going to go into my mouth. Hey,</v>

16
00:01:10.551 --> 00:01:15.170
what's going on guys? My name is [inaudible]. I am a rapper. I grew up

17
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.450
studying battle rap. I was very focused on my punchlines of ours.

18
00:01:20.451 --> 00:01:23.060
More than anything else. You're still cool.

19
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.250
Hi, my name is Nick Smith and I'm a pop artist and song writer.

20
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.820
And I love finding that balance between a song that's really deep,

21
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.550
but at the same time, it's really easy to listen to.

22
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.150
<v 1>Now you did decide to what the teams are going to be for today. Song battle.</v>

23
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.793
<v 0>Is in my throat.</v>

24
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:45.523
<v 1>Get ready.</v>

25
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.840
And the teams are Lex you're on team Simon and

26
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.790
Maggie team. Evergreen.

27
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.570
We have a specific theme for today's song battle. The theme is.

28
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.333
<v 0>Okay.</v>

29
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.160
<v 1>That's a tough subject to write a song.</v>

30
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.160
I don't have much experience with that one.

31
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.770
I'm not going to talk about how I'm going to take it.

32
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.910
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

33
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.780
<v 1>We asked our audience and followers for word suggestions based on the theme of</v>

34
00:02:20.781 --> 00:02:22.250
death. All right, team Simon,

35
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.480
three words for your team's lyrics are time gone and

36
00:02:26.481 --> 00:02:27.320
heal.

37
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.620
And the three words for your team's lyrics are comfort,

38
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.210
pain and fear. Absolutely.

39
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.040
Each team will have two hours to create an original song with the team of

40
00:02:43.041 --> 00:02:47.180
debt and use the selected three words in your lyrics given by our followers.

41
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.660
I hope you all vibe with each other and made the best song wins.

42
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.800
<v 0>Seriously. Are we going to do hip hop? We're going to go all out.</v>

43
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.060
We're going to go, you know, like with.

44
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.220
<v 2>The death theme, I'm not thinking like sadness,</v>

45
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:06.160
I'm thinking like I'm killing my competition. Like rappers,

46
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.740
like I'm telling them that type of debt.

47
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.470
<v 3>We just literally do something that's like see</v>

48
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.410
she to at her to,

49
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.570
like the most basic progression you've ever heard.

50
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.800
Honestly, like if we're going for like pop, let's go for a pop.

51
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.150
Let's go for pop.

52
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.963
Jump it.

53
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.560
<v 0>Awesome. I love that.</v>

54
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.680
<v 2>I kind of liked that one. Yeah.</v>

55
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.560
I'm going to loop at two minutes. Have fun. Is this a, is this a number one?

56
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.090
Hit song on a billboard. It's up to you. That's not.

57
00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.280
So it's all on me now. That's what you're saying. Exactly. There we go.

58
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.790
Sometimes I get a buzz in the air. Oh no, I lost my stuff.

59
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.380
Oh no. If you open it back up,

60
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.650
it won't be like auto save to the last. Probably not.

61
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.550
That's the first time I saw that air, I'm saving every six seconds now.

62
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.310
<v 3>Lyrica, uh,</v>

63
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.760
death as a metaphor for like an ending relationship.

64
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.070
I feel like that's so it's a ball.

65
00:04:29.071 --> 00:04:33.420
We can use a lot of fun metaphors and like cliche is, and it'll be easy.

66
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.470
It really works for me.

67
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.203
<v 0>Great.</v>

68
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.593
<v 2>Did we lose her?</v>

69
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.260
<v 0>My computer just crashed. Um, God,</v>

70
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.360
this is the worst timing.

71
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.700
<v 2>Yeah. And the me are my enemies. Want me dead? That's funny.</v>

72
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.230
I like starting it off with the hook. Like,

73
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.120
like on some debate they just call me like, Oh, for sure. Enemies.

74
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.790
I trust. I trust you. I trust your, um, your artistry. Okay. Okay.

75
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.433
Enemies.

76
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.390
<v 0>Enemies will be dead. Funny.</v>

77
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.530
<v 2>Yeah. Maybe just this stuff at the beginning. Right. And then me. So my.</v>

78
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.570
<v 0>Enemies would be dead funny.</v>

79
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.920
<v 2>Yeah. So hard. All right. Cool. I'm really excited for this one.</v>

80
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.120
<v 3>My back, my computer,</v>

81
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.920
like fully crashed that's way. Oh my gosh.

82
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.320
I, yeah, I hope it's okay. Yeah, me too.

83
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.280
<v 0>Um.</v>

84
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.170
<v 3>And this just starts on the one. Yeah.</v>

85
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.220
<v 0>Oh, wait, wait. It doesn't. Maybe doesn't start on the one.</v>

86
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.370
<v 2>That was cool, but just happened. That was that. Wasn't what I wrote.</v>

87
00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.290
<v 0>Finished sleep, but I'm killing dreams and stuff.</v>

88
00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.020
<v 2>I'm like blanking right now, but I got this. I got I doing like, Oh,</v>

89
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.560
you know what? Um, I'm like psyching myself out.

90
00:06:17.561 --> 00:06:21.100
But I think that once I get like a rhyme scheme, I'll be able to like, go,

91
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.190
go for, okay. I have to do like funeral lines.

92
00:06:24.191 --> 00:06:28.360
I have to do like death lines and trying to think like, yeah. Right.

93
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:33.490
But I want to get this flow down first and then work on my next flight to be

94
00:06:33.491 --> 00:06:36.400
stressful though. Isn't it look at you. I know I'm getting stressed out.

95
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.410
I swear. It's not distressful to work with me on a normal shirt.

96
00:06:40.411 --> 00:06:42.850
It's not actually making something fires.

97
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.360
<v 0>What do you feel about a vocoder? Chorus moment.</v>

98
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.870
Love it. Awesome.

99
00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.660
You killed it all.

100
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.450
Oh, wasn't it fun?

101
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.330
<v 2>That's perfect. Yeah. Literally that gives me so much inspiration, so, okay.</v>

102
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:18.653
<v 0>[Inaudible] killed it.</v>

103
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.350
<v 2>Like so stripped out just like the chords and like the vocoder.</v>

104
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.630
Yeah, totally. Okay. Got this.

105
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.320
<v 1>Oh, team evergreen. Hi team Simon. Sorry.</v>

106
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:33.430
<v 0>We're a challenge. Isn't it?</v>

107
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:40.090
<v 1>Today's challenge is the household objects challenge.</v>

108
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.410
Our followers have suggested different household objects and your team must find

109
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.970
record and use. The sounds made from that object in your song,

110
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:54.040
your team must use a zipper for today's challenge.

111
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:58.990
Your team must use a blender for today's challenge.

112
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.040
<v 2>I don't have, I do have a blender.</v>

113
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.590
<v 1>All right. Good luck guys. Thank you. Cool.</v>

114
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.830
<v 0>Record one. That's slow. And then one that's like fast.</v>

115
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:10.720
Cause what I'm going to do is turn into a percussive element.

116
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.740
Zipper jeans. Oh, jacket, easy a jacket.

117
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:20.710
Let me go grab the blender real quick.

118
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:28.390
Can't get the zipper. Okay.

119
00:08:28.391 --> 00:08:32.740
I'm sending the zipper to now tell me this anymore.

120
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:42.573
It's like it's right here.

121
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.990
<v 2>Yeah. I love it. It's like perfect.</v>

122
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.380
<v 0>You killed it.</v>

123
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:57.330
The most stressful thing I've ever. God,

124
00:08:57.331 --> 00:08:58.650
my computer crashed again.

125
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.390
<v 2>Camera's on the one on down. I know. I know. I know. All right,</v>

127
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:19.340
<v 3>Okay. I'm back. My computer crashed again. I'm going to attract some harmonies.</v>

128
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.050
You catch it?

129
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:23.270
<v 0>Yeah. Killed it.</v>

130
00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:31.730
You killed it. Oh, all right. Let's go. It sees this can pick it up the coat.

134
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.820
What she's feeling, whereas him asleep, lying on me, but the truth parts killer.

135
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.600
Right. But then I said as parts to Brazil who the young and maneuver. Oh, sorry.

136
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.690
Pick up your new arm. Cause I've been to take since the grim abuser. Cool.

137
00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.370
That's going to have to be good enough.

138
00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.800
<v 3>I need to like remember to breathe.</v>

139
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:06.290
<v 0>Oh dude. Comfort. Yeah.</v>

140
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.270
Yes. Yes.

141
00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:12.710
<v 3>Oh, I forgot to use the zipper. Hold on. Okay. All right. Oh,</v>

142
00:10:12.711 --> 00:10:14.210
let's get that going.

143
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.900
I'm feeling the pressure today for sure. I'm really feeling.

144
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:26.593
<v 0>Oh my God.</v>

145
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:31.070
<v 2>I always say the first words before I come in. Oh, why do you do that?</v>

146
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.190
It just helps me kind of gain the same payment.

147
00:10:34.191 --> 00:10:38.630
So I make sure I'm kind of body's about the seasons. My cohort. I'm like,

148
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:39.920
Ooh girl, her competition.

I got scared. Oh no. Make sure you saving. I don't

150
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:51.560
know what you're doing.

151

<v 0>Oh my God. This is crazy.</v>

<v 3>Swan song, right? Yeah. So I was on that. Okay.</v>

153
00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.580
It's like flappy song for like how sad, depressing.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:03.213
<v 2>You. The truth.</v>

155
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:08.000
You are definitely the true quickest mastering you've ever seen in your life.

156
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.880
Love it. What do you wanna call it?

157
00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:20.030
<v 3>Good. It's so good. It's an edit that like it didn't even listen to, so.</v>

158
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:25.930
<v 2>That first hour I could not think of anything. And then it finally came to me.</v>

159
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:30.080
What? I was getting a blender. The blender got blended that got me.

160
00:11:30.081 --> 00:11:31.130
It gave me inspiration.

161
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:35.630
<v 3>Well, I feel like we did really well given everything for this track,</v>

162
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:39.350
it was all about making her voice pop shot.

163
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.510
<v 0>The song we made is a bit short,</v>

164
00:11:41.511 --> 00:11:44.510
but there's a clear sense of structure and we kind of wrapped it up in a ribbon.

165
00:11:44.511 --> 00:11:48.830
So it's this nice, concise little sock. I hope that when people hear the song,

166
00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.680
they don't think it was something that was rushed.

167
00:11:51.681 --> 00:11:53.890
And then it sounds like a really song.

168
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.520
<v 2>Enjoy your session. Sure. Yeah. Okay.</v>

169
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.640
All right. Hi everyone. Welcome back.

170
00:12:03.641 --> 00:12:07.690
I hope both teams were able to get everything done in two hours.

171
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.510
Let's now hear team every.

172
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:27.930
<v 0>Oh no. I love that back on vocals. Beautiful.</v>

173
00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:32.573
Oh my God.

174
00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:38.783
Oh

175
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:47.910
God. Why?

176
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:50.580
This sounds so great.

177
00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:02.180
Thank you.

178
00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:06.250
<v 2>Have such a nice voice. Thank you. Beautiful voice feels like,</v>

179
00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:10.950
like a feather is tickling my ear or something. As soon as I heard Meg's voice,

180
00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.160
I knew that that's going to be a great pairing with a dear Evergreen's

181
00:13:14.161 --> 00:13:18.210
production. And it was a mix. Vocals were gorgeous. And um,

182
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.270
dear evergreens production was fantastic. So.

183
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:26.610
<v 0>Like shouts out to them. Whoa,</v>

184
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:29.580
enemies are my enemies. Want me dead funny?

185
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:34.650
And a G really in and all of these heads running and it deems gone. Tell me,

186
00:13:34.651 --> 00:13:36.540
get to that bread. Money.

187
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.290
Enemies are, my enemies will be dead. As funny.

188
00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:49.560
My inner game has gone. Somehow. They smoked us,

189
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:54.630
has been asleep and I'm killing dreams and stent and haunting all my enemies.

190
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:55.583
When me, dad

191
00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.510
[inaudible] me to get Ben. Cause they going to be gone by Tom I'm here.

192
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.400
Then John fall, spring, summer, winter,

193
00:14:05.401 --> 00:14:08.880
I find the bodies about the seasons picking up my cohort. I'm like, Ooh, Ooh,

194
00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.670
[inaudible] pick up your new arm because I'm going to take lives on abuse or a

195
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.750
mass funeral row. You won't get that.

196
00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:21.360
Still get to live frog and don't matter what you are. Yeah.

197
00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:24.630
And it means that my enemies will be dead as funny. And

198
00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:32.370
[inaudible] they get to that breath. They finish asleep,

199
00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:35.190
but I'm killing dreams instead that hunting hole.

200
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:40.230
<v 2>Holy like, wow, like, Whoa,</v>

201
00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:43.200
your vocals are insane.

202
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.600
Sound like literally a superstar. I'm Brian.

203
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.250
<v 0>Dream team right there.</v>

204
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.850
<v 3>So I think maybe we need to work on a project.</v>

205
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.060
[inaudible] that was crazy good.

206
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:06.350
Like from the first like two seconds, I knew like, okay,

207
00:15:06.351 --> 00:15:07.670
this is a really good song.

208
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.000
You could just tell from their energy and from the music that they played,

209
00:15:11.001 --> 00:15:15.740
that like these two were like, meant to collaborate together.

210
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.610
This is going to be a hard one. They're so different.

211
00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:25.930
<v 1>Well, we've posted the songs online for voting and people already picking their</v>

212
00:15:25.931 --> 00:15:27.520
favorite track as we speak.

213
00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.810
And soon we're going to find out which team is going to win today.

214
00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:41.860
Honestly, you do think your team is going to win. This one is really tough.

215
00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:44.380
Our songs are completely completely.

216
00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:47.080
<v 3>So I'm, I'm convinced we're not winning,</v>

217
00:15:47.081 --> 00:15:49.690
which is fine because I'm still very proud of the work that we did.

218
00:15:49.691 --> 00:15:54.040
I'm proud of myself, but I definitely think their song. It was like, cool.

219
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.610
<v 2>I was super nervous about this experience.</v>

220
00:15:57.611 --> 00:16:02.440
And so the idea of my team winning would kind of make me feel a lot better as a

221
00:16:02.441 --> 00:16:03.160
writer.

222
00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:07.870
<v 1>How the results with me, it was very, very close.</v>

223
00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:13.150
Okay. Very close. But there can only be one winner.

224
00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:20.230
Look, everyone's so tense. The winning song for today,

225
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.970
song lab is head hunting from team Simon and

226
00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:26.170
means of my enemies.

227
00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:32.470
Now we have to make an AP.

228
00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:38.980
<v 3>Exactly. I'm really happy with everything to be honest.</v>

229
00:16:38.981 --> 00:16:42.700
Like I think it all went really well. I'm proud of myself. I think they totally,

230
00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.640
totally deserve to win. They absolutely.

231
00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:49.990
<v 1>That's a big sigh of relief. Just big,</v>

232
00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:52.660
massive weight off my shoulders now, you know, it's definitely,

233
00:16:52.661 --> 00:16:56.140
obviously it's not about winning, but it's nice to finally get a win for once.

234
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:58.870
<v 2>Oh, my biggest takeaway is, uh,</v>

235
00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:03.430
I think I would say like not underestimate myself. Um, yeah,

236
00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.380
doing that in two hours was kind of crazy.

237
00:17:05.381 --> 00:17:08.200
And the fact that I was able to do it is pretty great.

238
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:11.740
Simon absolutely killed it and I would love to work with him in the future.

239
00:17:11.741 --> 00:17:16.240
So siren, when you, when you hear this, I want to work with you, you killed it.

240
00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:19.150
And I think that collectively as a group and within two hours,

241
00:17:19.151 --> 00:17:20.290
I think we did a pretty good job.

242
00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:23.830
