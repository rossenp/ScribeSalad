<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.200
<v 1>How can you tell if someone is anatomy superfan through their knowledge of</v>

3
00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:18.140
different enemy series? Is it by their collection of figurines,

4
00:00:18.141 --> 00:00:21.680
posters and flushes? Maybe it's by how they dress, or even if they cost a fight,

5
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.780
we brought together seven enemy superfans, but one is alive.

6
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.080
If the group discovers who the liar is, they'll win the cash prize.

7
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.510
If the life survives, they win the cash prize.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.390
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

9
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.860
<v 1>This is odd men out.</v>

10
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.420
<v 2>I'm sure like the first question that's going to get asked is what's your bigger</v>

11
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.100
enemy, you know, obscure.

12
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.110
<v 0>Or animate that really, really helps you.</v>

13
00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:11.390
Can't tell him your favorite underrated animate.

14
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.470
Cause you clearly haven't watched enough animate to be an enemy super fan.

15
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.050
<v 1>You had to watch the show to know.</v>

16
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.740
I think it's very hard to actually try and pretend you're an enemy fan.

17
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.460
<v 0>I'm really excited to play his game and see how my detective skills are.</v>

18
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.610
<v 2>Ooh, obscure. Let's see how obscure can we get?</v>

19
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.040
<v 0>Goodness. COVID doesn't have a lot of dialogue, which makes it special.</v>

20
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.420
I don't know. I love lots of animals.

21
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.150
<v 2>Category circus.</v>

22
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.630
<v 0>There's too many people don't get this.</v>

23
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.660
<v 2>Oh, banana fish is not really that obscure.</v>

24
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.210
<v 0>All right. Kurt banana fish is solid. Hot take least favorite anime,</v>

25
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.100
hot take least favorite database.

26
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.550
Do I have news for you buddy

27
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.850
off Amazon demon, Slayer hoodie feels a little bit generic.

28
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.900
<v 2>Sailor moon bottle opener.</v>

29
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.610
<v 0>Dang. That's a popular animate though. Kurt.</v>

30
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.500
I really don't think it's current discovered after this round

31
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.590
for the rediscover up to this round.

32
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.950
<v 2>Where does everyone watch animate?</v>

33
00:02:48.951 --> 00:02:51.860
So where you might get some illegal sites, you might get like crunchy roll Hulu,

34
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.380
Netflix. So we're going to see.

35
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.580
<v 0>Oh, where does a room anywhere? I.</v>

36
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.300
<v 2>Prefer Hulu, mostly.</v>

37
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.870
<v 1>Flicks these days up till a few weeks</v>

38
00:03:06.871 --> 00:03:08.850
ago. And no.

39
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.950
<v 2>Either Netflix or illegal sites. Suzanne may kiss. M R I P.</v>

40
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.093
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

41
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.040
<v 2>I am with Chad.</v>

42
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.600
[inaudible] yeah, let me get in there. I feel okay.

43
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.620
<v 0>Okay. Who should I vote for?</v>

44
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.060
Please tell me I'm most suspicious. I think I'm going to vote Antwan out.

45
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.390
I'll vote for Katie. I'm sorry for Jennifer.

46
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.320
<v 2>Well, for Sunil, she was the last one to say rip kiss animate.</v>

47
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.470
When something is big to the community as kiss anime dies,

48
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.360
like that's the way you react. I think I'm going to go with.

49
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.040
<v 0>Katie. I'm going to vote for Katie. Sorry.</v>

50
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.390
<v 2>The person eliminated this round is</v>

51
00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.753
Katie.

52
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.480
You will have 10 minutes to prove that you're an enemy super fan by

53
00:04:15.481 --> 00:04:20.220
taking a photo of your enemy related possessions or collectibles.

54
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.720
I already got it on my desktop.

55
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:26.850
You guys will have 10 minutes to do this and the time starts now.

56
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.053
<v 0>Cause I was like, what?</v>

57
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.820
<v 2>We're let me grab this nice Coco figure. Cause.</v>

58
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.470
<v 0>This is Mario scrunchie. Oh, included all my is my favorite.</v>

59
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.870
So I'm just going to cover this dude's face anyway,

60
00:04:42.871 --> 00:04:44.550
because he's a trashed character.

61
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.520
<v 2>Table's a mess. Why is there a random toothbrush?</v>

62
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.880
Anime fans should understand this, that there's late nights of bingeing.

63
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.950
I have this it's my panel badge because I was on a panel for anime NYC.

64
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.630
I think my Comic-Con badge counts.

65
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.440
I'm a little worried because a lot of these things are like pretty mainstream,

66
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.410
but that's just because the mainstream anime or what.

67
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.190
<v 0>I want to put this picture. It's an inside joke with my best friend, Bridgette.</v>

68
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.090
No, one's going to understand it, but it has anime on it.

69
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.610
I have a normal closet in my room and then I have a second closet and this

70
00:05:14.611 --> 00:05:17.100
closet is purely for cost.

71
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.100
<v 2>Time to take my photo. Now I should have this the other way around.</v>

72
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.770
<v 1>See the covers. I</v>

73
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.600
put out my truth. Oh, okay. Here's a nursery toast.

74
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.970
<v 2>He's got a, uh, Joe just bizarre venture hat. Okay. And dragon ball hat.</v>

75
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.670
<v 0>Not from spirit away. I'm screwed.</v>

76
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.490
<v 2>I don't know. I'd be like, guys don't buy as much stuff unless it's on Farid.</v>

77
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.600
Oh. Ooh. Cos play.

78
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:49.291
<v 0>Sorry.</v>

79
00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:53.580
I'm not understanding the things in this picture made me poor for loving anime.

80
00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.610
I think I'm gaining the trust of the people.

81
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.080
<v 2>And physical Chan.</v>

82
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.330
That is definitely animated. Flax.

83
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.040
<v 0>Definitely anime. It's like, wow. I feel like septic.</v>

84
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.960
Oh my God. We got here.

85
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:16.120
<v 2>Classics.</v>

86
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.370
<v 0>I don't think it's Gabriel anymore. He has, I trust.</v>

87
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.140
<v 2>Did. Everyone's gotten a at them and then a body pillow.</v>

88
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.080
<v 3>Character. The rest I can respect though.</v>

89
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:29.403
<v 0>Bro.</v>

90
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.730
<v 2>I know this is anime, but I love the frog way. This is a NovoTAL wall.</v>

91
00:06:33.731 --> 00:06:37.900
This is not what it was like froggy wallet. This is animate. Oh Jennifer.

92
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.210
Oh Jennifer.

93
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.620
<v 0>Ah. There's the full metal Alchemist. It's too soon.</v>

94
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.410
He had a good shoe shopping King factor.

95
00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.873
It's the float.

96
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.760
<v 2>I love that shame Kings though, to me, Gabriel,</v>

97
00:07:00.761 --> 00:07:04.060
we're going to bite on the classics man. Me and Tony. We would vibe together.

98
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.040
I can vibe well with Antonie.

99
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.100
<v 0>But why doesn't he have any like new stuff every day.</v>

100
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.890
<v 3>Things cool. And then they bring in one thing to bring it down. What is.</v>

101
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.110
<v 0>If y'all don't know that he's talking about? Um,</v>

102
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:19.930
uh it's okay. You don't have to know.

103
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:27.040
<v 2>She got some plus she's. Ooh. Okay. Okay. Ah, I trust them.</v>

104
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.030
<v 0>Some of this is animated though. These are just, um,</v>

105
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.460
a man I'm suspicious of Jennifer. Now.

106
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.600
I feel like everyone's going to react and be like, it's not enough.

107
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:42.430
<v 2>Did you play dang on Rabo or just wash the</v>

108
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:45.160
anime for sure. Better than the show.

109
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:49.870
<v 0>Oh my gosh. I have had the Pekichu clock for many years.</v>

110
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.420
He's mine now. I'm still like Pete. Good. You thought.

111
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:58.390
<v 2>Oh wow. She has hell of a Nana Fitch. Oh the phone.</v>

112
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.230
<v 0>I love the cheese.</v>

113
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.780
<v 2>Shooter. I'm crying.</v>

114
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:09.160
<v 0>Is that.</v>

115
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.350
<v 3>A wait? Is that a body pillow or a regular pillow?</v>

116
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.320
<v 0>Is that a body? Pillow? Filler. Regular pillow. Okay. I think Kurt is a Weaver.</v>

117
00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.320
<v 2>Don't be surprised if your body pillow is missing tonight.</v>

118
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.350
<v 0>Okay. Now that's a threat.</v>

119
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:25.270
<v 3>Everything came out strong and that's why I'm concerned.</v>

120
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.100
<v 2>Tony's collection. I love it.</v>

121
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.060
<v 0>And what had to get stuff, but it was all like anime from like 10 years ago.</v>

122
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:34.570
So that's why I'm like a little suspicious.

123
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:36.340
<v 3>Right now. I have to go with cat.</v>

124
00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.550
They could just be a cosplay or not necessarily like a real anime fan.

125
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:44.890
<v 0>His closet was very low key. It didn't have much. I'm so sorry.</v>

126
00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:46.180
And Toronto, I'm going to vote for you,

127
00:08:46.181 --> 00:08:50.320
but it's I'm voting for you because I feel like you're voting for me actually.

128
00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:52.840
A little suspicious of Jennifer faced on the picture though.

129
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.880
Her merge is very little.

130
00:08:54.881 --> 00:08:59.490
It's more of James than MMA. I'm sorry, Jennifer.

131
00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.920
<v 2>I am most suspicious of Jennifer. I got to vote for Jennifer.</v>

132
00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.060
I've got to trust my heart.

133
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.510
I got to believe in the heart of the cards you get a reference.

134
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:13.130
The votes are and the person eliminated this round

135
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.740
is Jennifer

136
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:27.140
Sinead. Good luck everyone. I'll be playing fire one. Faith's revelation.

137
00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.970
<v 1>[Inaudible] Kurt. I knew it. I knew it. Sorry.</v>

138
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:41.930
<v 2>Each person will get 30 seconds to tell everyone the story about an</v>

139
00:09:41.931 --> 00:09:44.030
experience you had related to anime.

140
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.170
<v 0>Susan, I went to eight Cod in Fort worth, Texas, if you guys haven't been there,</v>

141
00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:49.880
it's kind of like cowboy city.

142
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.510
And so none of my friends cos played at all and we went to go get dinner.

143
00:09:53.511 --> 00:09:57.190
And because I was a poor student, we had to stay far away from the con centers.

144
00:09:57.191 --> 00:10:00.050
So you went to get breakfast at this like old timey diner.

145
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:04.250
And I was the only one in cosplay and I was just surrounded by like grandmas and

146
00:10:04.251 --> 00:10:05.360
grandpas who had like,

147
00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:09.980
no idea why this weirdo girl was just like so out of place.

148
00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.740
And I think that was like probably one of my most embarrassing stories.

149
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.930
That's kind of related to like a Cotter animate, whatever,

150
00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.040
and just like live your life.

151
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.280
<v 3>I was actually introduced to anime by my parents. Not,</v>

152
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.110
they didn't know it was that though. Uh,

153
00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.720
my dad showed me speed racer because he grew up watching that.

154
00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.440
And then I didn't know it was anime. He didn't know it was anime. I watched it.

155
00:10:27.441 --> 00:10:29.450
And then I was like, Oh, this is cool. They're talking a little funny,

156
00:10:29.451 --> 00:10:30.260
but it's cool.

157
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:34.280
And over time I started to learn about it and I really enjoyed it. Uh,

158
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.460
got into proper with criminal alchemists. I feel like a lot of people, uh,

159
00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:41.270
and in drag Waze and then, you know, show on track. Then I like, I,

160
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:42.980
I liked it so much for being a part of my career.

161
00:10:42.981 --> 00:10:45.350
I make videos of all the time I talk about all the time. I,

162
00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.270
I mess with you in my time.

163
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:52.970
<v 0>I'm normally a very shy person and I don't really, I'm not that social at that,</v>

164
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.900
but I have this friend who I cost play the, my hero, academia, moms with,

165
00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:00.410
and we make like public target, Tik TOK videos.

166
00:11:00.411 --> 00:11:02.990
And what you've seen on me probably have, because they always blow up.

167
00:11:02.991 --> 00:11:03.890
For some reason.

168
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:09.110
She actually got me out of my shell and cause playing in public either way.

169
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.830
It got me out of my shell. And so now here I am talking to a lot of people.

170
00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.620
Oh, I also got into anime. Oh, okay. Because of South park.

171
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:20.960
<v 1>For me, it's uh,</v>

172
00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.830
any expo I went to about two years ago and one of my favorites is a champagne

173
00:11:24.831 --> 00:11:27.370
shampoo. And I like Jean. Cause I think June is completely underrated.

174
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.840
Moving gets all the attention. And I went as him. Right.

175
00:11:29.841 --> 00:11:30.860
So when I went to the convention,

176
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.230
everybody kept coming up to me and asking me like, Oh,

177
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.020
where are you at for a samurai? But like with the Yas gala,

178
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:39.080
I ended up getting there yesterday, but he's the black samurai. He was in Japan.

179
00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.540
And most of the commission I had to like correcting people,

180
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.310
but I had the long hair. So I thought that would work in the hair,

181
00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:44.211
tied back and everything.

182
00:11:44.211 --> 00:11:48.080
So I thought it would have been fine gene for life though.

183
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.550
He's my he's my husband.

184
00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.810
<v 0>I totally relate to the getting up with cause plays at convention because like</v>

185
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:59.080
cosplay shorter, he always gets mistaken for Moneta somehow. And I'm like.

186
00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:02.850
<v 2>People are really mean disrespecting Moneta. Oh yeah.</v>

187
00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:04.890
<v 1>So like we're gonna fight right now.</v>

188
00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:09.480
<v 2>So me and my friends were at a bowling alley and then two of my friends got to</v>

189
00:12:09.481 --> 00:12:12.150
the side of me and like I held out the ball like, um, uh,

190
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.300
raises Shuriken from Darren.

191
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.050
So when he started like throwing like the shocker in there and I started like

192
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.270
streaming, like super loud in the bowling alley.

193
00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:22.800
And then I sent the ball and it would have been super cringy if it wasn't for

194
00:12:22.801 --> 00:12:27.060
the fact that I got a strike strike on my life,

195
00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.380
I will never try it again. If I do it, it'll just soil it's memory. I saved it.

196
00:12:31.381 --> 00:12:35.670
The video will never leave my phone, posted it online. What kind of viral?

197
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.133
That's how.

198
00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.100
<v 1>That now I felt the best because I feel like we all vibed with each other. Okay.</v>

199
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.740
<v 3>It just resonated with the stories like with Anthony, like,</v>

200
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.290
Oh I think he gets me safe.

201
00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:49.370
<v 2>I'm going to go for Curt. Just cause I need a vote for someone.</v>

202
00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:51.780
<v 3>Tried to get someone out. I'd say Gabriel.</v>

203
00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:54.180
<v 1>I think it's this time. I think it's again.</v>

204
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:58.770
<v 0>So few of us left. Anyone who gets like two votes. It's like, God,</v>

205
00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:01.620
I'm going to choose Gabriel. Just because he said shorter,

206
00:13:01.621 --> 00:13:04.710
couldn't compare to a Minetta and don't kiss Moneta like that.

207
00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.380
I'm coming for you buddy. You should already know I was coming for you.

208
00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.460
<v 2>And the person eliminated this round is Gabriel.</v>

209
00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:13.470
The Minetta comment.

210
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.820
I stand by what I said, Moneta is a King among Kings.

211
00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.860
And there is nothing that can take that away from him.

212
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:30.060
Everyone feels confident that you already caught them all. You can end the gig.

213
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:34.770
Now give me a thumbs up. If you want to continue the game or a thumbs down,

214
00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:38.640
if you think you caught the mole and wants to end the game.

215
00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:43.890
<v 3>I down for stop. Right? Okay. If it's one of y'all Hama,</v>

216
00:13:43.891 --> 00:13:46.700
be livid. I saw.

217
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:53.030
<v 2>If it's green, you guys went like that.</v>

218
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.960
Y'all if the box is red,

219
00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.830
the mole is still in the game and you guys lost you guys ready

220
00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:03.720
in three, two.

221
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:13.543
<v 0>[Inaudible] the mall.</v>

222
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.320
<v 3>The real class trial.</v>

223
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.850
<v 2>We're going to have the mall reveal cam or herself.</v>

224
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:26.730
<v 3>Three, two, one top 10.</v>

225
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:34.943
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

226
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.090
<v 1>I am a geek, but I'm just not an animate geek. I like Harry Potter.</v>

227
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.820
Star Wars is big for me. I also love game of Thrones.

228
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.790
I do like some anime and I'm very,

229
00:14:47.791 --> 00:14:49.860
very much in love with avatar the last Airbender,

230
00:14:49.861 --> 00:14:53.000
but that isn't actually considered anime.

231
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:56.390
I've only watched a samurai Champloo bebop. Uh,

232
00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.330
most of me is AKI and that's pretty much it. Yeah.

233
00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:04.630
<v 0>Whose shirt is that dog? Oh, this bra, this cert belongs.</v>

234
00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:09.170
<v 1>To my friend Devin. [inaudible].</v>

235
00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:11.530
<v 0>That was the most malicious thing you could have done.</v>

236
00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:18.010
Can we all be friends?

237
00:15:18.011 --> 00:15:22.780
Can we all like make a discord together or something and like lock down

238
00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.650
and Antwan, you can come to, I guess.
