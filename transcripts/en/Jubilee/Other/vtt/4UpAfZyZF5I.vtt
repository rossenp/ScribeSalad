00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.710
<v 0>We make assumptions about people all the time. It's not necessarily a bad thing,</v>

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.910
but how often are we actually right about the assumptions we make and how often

3
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:13.080
are we right about the assumptions other people make about us to find out.

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.350
We decided to put someone in the hot seat and have 100 strangers,

5
00:00:16.351 --> 00:00:21.300
rate them one to 100 based on various levels of first impression in doing so we

6
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:24.510
would hopefully be able to see how different ways of communicating could

7
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:28.830
drastically change the way we perceive others. Welcome to one-to-one hundred.

8
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.270
<v 2>Hi, my name is Julia and 20.</v>

9
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.530
What would you rate yourself average to good, like kind of in between seven,

10
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.780
10 and a half at 70 or 75,

11
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.890
this first group of people will only be able to look at you kind of

12
00:00:48.891 --> 00:00:50.930
nervous. I've never like been graded.

13
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.220
<v 1>Um, can she show her ears?</v>

14
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.593
Okay, cool.

15
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.080
<v 2>He wants to like a better fit for me, like a a hundred slides difficulty,</v>

16
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.440
or like a model she's flawless. And then I was like, well, you know,

17
00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:35.690
I can't just go on looks. I gotta look at other stuff.

18
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.720
And this is the most shallow thing. I Dr. Five points.

19
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.440
Cause she had some Wal-Mart in the background. I don't know if that's my vibe.

20
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.290
She wasn't really my type. She didn't look like a plain regular type of.

21
00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.473
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

22
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.220
<v 2>It was weird to kind of like people were like looking at me.</v>

23
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.880
I've never kind of experienced being like on a, like a display like that.

24
00:02:13.881 --> 00:02:14.930
I guess. I don't know.

25
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.580
Julie has given me fashion fun and quirkiness and I'm loving it and

26
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.020
she's absolutely stunning.

27
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.660
And then one of the most beautiful people you could have chosen,

28
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.670
she's super pretty. And she's also like not afraid to be herself.

29
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.680
And she also sounds like really funny.

30
00:02:48.681 --> 00:02:52.580
Like I just listened to a part of one of her videos and she was telling like a

31
00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:56.300
funny story and that just made her even more pretty, but I'm going to cry.

32
00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.220
There's some nice, obviously she's very like.

33
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.580
<v 3>I see some of her posts where she's advocating for black lives matters.</v>

34
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.130
I'm privileged and I will never understand what it's like to be black.

35
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.240
That's what's most important to me sort of is that sometimes people can look

36
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.360
extremely beautiful or attractive until they open their mouth.

37
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.120
It's a brave thing to do, especially in class. And you would see backlash.

38
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.020
<v 2>It just makes it like.</v>

39
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.370
<v 3>I did like my own special rating between one and a hundred,</v>

40
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.200
150 and pop track.

41
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.600
If she was obviously I gave her a fit because she's beautiful.

42
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.070
The rest was like bonus points, 10 points for having a cool pose.

43
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.640
10 more points for, you know, talking about black lives matter.

44
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.880
Everybody else was saying that she was beautiful. I don't know.

45
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.580
I didn't really find her or anything.

46
00:03:41.581 --> 00:03:44.340
It's not the type of girl I usually like go for.

47
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.720
<v 1>So we can speak about your score. Um,</v>

48
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.510
what about her Instagram led to you giving that score?

49
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.450
<v 3>I did not realize that it was one to 100 that you thought it was a scale out of</v>

50
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.250
10. Yeah. Especially by societal standards. She's incredibly attractive,

51
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.850
but I'm not too fond of like perfection.

52
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.860
<v 2>There's people are so nice. I was looking to cry. They're so sweet.</v>

53
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.230
I love how they were like really putting the importance on,

54
00:04:31.231 --> 00:04:34.760
not just like the outside, but like on the inside. There's some, some kind.

55
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.490
<v 1>We are going to head over to the next section now, which is the phone call.</v>

56
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.440
<v 2>Hi Julia. Okay. Hi. How are you? Where are you from?</v>

57
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.010
So I'm from Vancouver. Oh, cool. Don't they have a good don't.

58
00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.150
You'll have to a Naval syrup. Oh my God.

59
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.680
I love your energy. Yeah. Hang on. I'm here to have a good time.

60
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.550
I like hearing your voice. I'm trying to guess how old you are. I'm 20

61
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.440
or what about it? Like makes us think that was, I talk really fast.

62
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.430
I've been twice. So I don't know. I've always used a blabber and I hate it,

63
00:05:17.431 --> 00:05:21.090
but like that's just me Canadian bacon. Is that it's ham,

64
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.340
but then why is it like hogging and making it so misleading?

65
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.110
Like it's actually in Canada too. I have no idea. I'm a pescatarian, so. Okay.

66
00:05:28.111 --> 00:05:32.490
Nice. Amazing. Are you from I'm from Mississippi. Oh,

67
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.680
okay. Well we do. So I'm like a model and like a musicians and a student.

68
00:05:37.681 --> 00:05:40.170
So I kind of like, I'm all over the place. So I was in New York,

69
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.930
then I was in LA and I went to Turkey and I went to India.

70
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.040
<v 3>I just recently graduated. I didn't employ the current light bulb.</v>

71
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.230
<v 2>Well, the world we're all in employed at some point, I suppose. So.</v>

72
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.350
Yeah, definitely. Um, what else? Even food.

73
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.520
Favorite food. I'm not really picky. Any hobbies?

74
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.600
<v 3>Oh man. Well, I'm taking five classes right now, so.</v>

75
00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:07.463
<v 2>No free time.</v>

76
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.390
<v 3>Make the world a better place.</v>

77
00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.070
<v 2>Hm I'm a Christian. So like, I believe that like being a light in the world,</v>

78
00:06:15.071 --> 00:06:17.350
like wherever I go, it's holding the door open or smiling.

79
00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.440
I can change someone's whole life. Oh yeah. That's awesome.

80
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.360
<v 3>Hey man, I can already tell even without, without no face cams.</v>

81
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.470
Yo great personality. That's all right. That's two minutes.

82
00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.310
<v 2>I dunno. I felt that she was just a really down to earth person,</v>

83
00:06:33.311 --> 00:06:37.600
but in that two minutes, I mean, I wasn't able to see any of her flaws, right?

84
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.450
<v 3>Like her voice. Wasn't going to do anything for me in that way.</v>

85
00:06:40.451 --> 00:06:44.350
It's like a 62 off someone's voice and a two-minute conversation to me is like

86
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.213
pretty high.

87
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.700
<v 4>Um, obviously she seemed like a really nice approachable person,</v>

88
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.290
but without seeing someone,

89
00:06:50.291 --> 00:06:53.800
I can only assume really that she falls somewhere around the normal curve.

90
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.540
You know, I enjoy talking to her.

91
00:06:55.541 --> 00:06:58.150
So that's why she scored more than the 50th percentile.

92
00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.380
<v 2>My instinct tells me that was probably the lowest, but I could be wrong,</v>

93
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.480
but that's kind of like where I'm thinking.

94
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.150
I am a little insecure in how I talk.

95
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:30.010
I just hate listening to myself talk and I talk really fast and sometimes I like

96
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:31.720
mess up my words and that kind of stuff.

97
00:07:31.721 --> 00:07:35.320
So I guess I can be kind of like self-conscious about that. I talk a lot.

98
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.770
<v 3>This one videos on so you can just stay on camera.</v>

99
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.140
<v 2>Hey, how are you? Okay. Oh, is this an actual person? Oh</v>

100
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.630
God. Hi. I'm Julia. Hi there. I'm from Spain.

101
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.130
Maybe the accent. Yeah. I love you.

102
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.630
That's a beautiful accent. What's your sign Aries.

103
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:12.940
Ooh, fire queen. I'm a Virgo, but I'm a Sagittarius moon. Um,

104
00:08:12.941 --> 00:08:13.774
any hobbies?

105
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:20.200
<v 3>Um, all I do is study. I'm going to be a pre-med student over there.</v>

106
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.310
<v 2>I'm part of a dance to you on a singer songwriter. What about you?</v>

107
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:32.020
Play me a song really quick. Um, can I see it?

108
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:38.080
You look so beautiful by the way. I love your hair. Like your short hair.

109
00:08:38.081 --> 00:08:41.530
I wish I could pull it off. I cannot be like, Oh girl, you could work it.

110
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.560
So what kind of doctor or like medical question do you want.

111
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.960
<v 3>I'm thinking about, uh, being a cardiothoracic surgeon,</v>

112
00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.630
a neurological surgeon or both preferably Alrighty.

113
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.910
That's two minutes. He is a very pretty so. And you know, she,

114
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.370
uh, asked me about myself. Like honestly,

115
00:09:05.371 --> 00:09:09.780
think that was a really sweet aspect of her making me feel.

116
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.110
So that's also a plus.

117
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:18.060
She was really nice and I think would push it up the score more was that she was

118
00:09:18.061 --> 00:09:21.720
interested in like my dad's team. And um,

119
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.250
when I mentioned K-pop.

120
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.160
<v 2>I got a little more comfortable, I think,</v>

121
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:47.390
because I talk with my hands and I use gestures and facial expressions. Um,

122
00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.480
so I feel like maybe it went a little better because I could kind of like be,

123
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.630
you know, show like expressions and all that kind of stuff.

124
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.050
<v 3>Thinking back to every section and how you felt it went.</v>

125
00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.400
If you can guess the average score within three points of it,

126
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:02.990
then you went a hundred dollars.

127
00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.530
<v 2>Okay. Let me just, I'm going to go 83.</v>

128
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:15.643
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

129
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.243
<v 2>Oh, really.</v>

130
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.620
<v 4>Scoring someone from one to 100. Obviously. That's really hard to do,</v>

131
00:10:24.621 --> 00:10:26.360
especially if you can't see the person.

132
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:33.260
<v 2>Just so you know, this is against everything I stand for. I'm here.</v>

133
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:35.810
I'm I'm in a committed relationship. Like I was like, this is

134
00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.350
what I was like. No, no, no. I Dr. Five points for Walmart. Okay.

135
00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:45.350
<v 3>The average for that round was 86.</v>

136
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:50.390
<v 2>Oh shoot. Well, I'm just a Savage.</v>

137
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:52.280
I feel bad, but

138
00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.500
I would actually have to get to know the person for that person to be like more

139
00:10:57.501 --> 00:10:58.334
attractive.

140
00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.030
<v 4>Attractiveness is really subjective.</v>

141
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.540
I think ultimately these numbers are kind of just numbers and it really just

142
00:11:05.541 --> 00:11:08.810
matters like how you feel about yourself and how you portray yourself.

143
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:12.590
And I think the other thing is that, you know, when we're at evaluating people,

144
00:11:12.591 --> 00:11:17.400
we're always afraid of offending them. But you know, ultimately I,

145
00:11:17.401 --> 00:11:21.110
I think it's important to be pragmatic and, and to, um,

146
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.700
score how you feel they should be scored.

147
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.650
<v 2>Overall. It was so funny,</v>

148
00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.470
interesting to kind of get to interact with these people and see how they,

149
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.420
how they saw me, because I'm always like wondered,

150
00:11:29.421 --> 00:11:32.180
like what do I look like from somebody else's perspective?

151
00:11:32.181 --> 00:11:35.150
And if you can meet ourselves from somebody else's eyes, that'd be so cool,

152
00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.330
but also not putting too much stress on that because I can't change that.

153
00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:39.493
I'm gonna keep being me.

154
00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:45.860
<v 1>Okay.</v>
