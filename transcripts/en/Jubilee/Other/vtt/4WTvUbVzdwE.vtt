00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.900
<v 0>I guess what I'm trying to say. Okay. Sorry.</v>

2
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.873
<v 1>Hello.</v>

3
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.610
Oh my gosh. It's happening.

4
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.110
<v 2>A second high school has now closed truth schools. We opened first.</v>

5
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.880
You can't have one basic answer across the country because we have so many,

6
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.370
much variability. It can not be done unsafely,

7
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.400
or we'll be right back where we started. I've just feel like that's the risk.

8
00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:31.130
Some of us seniors are willing to take, to have our senior year.

9
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.850
<v 0>My name is Charlie. I'm going into my seat.</v>

10
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.740
<v 2>And I'm from Los Angeles, California. My name is NILAH. I live in Philadelphia,</v>

11
00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:47.030
Pennsylvania, and I am going to meet. Hi. My name is [inaudible]

12
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.030
. I'm from the greater Boston area, Massachusetts, and I'm going to be a sophomore. I'm 

13
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.030
Sophie

14
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.030
. I live in Omaha, Nebraska, and I'm going to be a sophomore in high school. My name's Jacob. 

15
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.030
I live in Michigan. I'm

16
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.030
 going into my junior high and Vanessa, I am 70 years. So, and I live in Florida. I'm Hannah. I'm going into my senior year and I'm in Spokane, Washington. 

17
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.863
Tech-Talk is life three, two, one.

18
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.620
<v 0>I used to spend so much time on Tik TOK,</v>

19
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.560
but it got to a point where it became a problem.

20
00:01:27.561 --> 00:01:31.610
I sometimes spent four hours on Tik TOK, just like scrolling.

21
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.990
<v 2>For me. It's like clearly a problem, but I see like roll with it.</v>

22
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.650
Like the enjoyment that I get out of tech talk is like, so immense, like,

23
00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:42.140
I don't know what I do with my six extra hours.

24
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.310
I never even like got Tik TOK or had Tik talk.

25
00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:48.200
I just don't really get it. Honestly.

26
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.890
It really depends on like what content you watch. Once you get past the skinny,

27
00:01:51.891 --> 00:01:54.290
hot girls dancing, like commentary, teak talk.

28
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.670
<v 0>I mean, those tech talks end up everywhere. And those references slip in.</v>

29
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.180
It's definitely not something that you can ignore because it's so there.

30
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.860
<v 2>My school to go back to in-person learning</v>

31
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.880
three, two, one,

32
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.190
And if one of the worst things, when you come

33
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.220
and everyone is doing whatever they want, you're not ready right now to go back.

34
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.620
I'm a senior this year and I just, I love school. So I really,

35
00:02:30.621 --> 00:02:31.550
really want to go back.

36
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.620
But I definitely don't want to go back at the risk of like spreading COVID.

37
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.900
I'm actually like really happy with my school's plans.

38
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.020
Cause we have like four options that if you don't feel comfortable going back to

39
00:02:42.021 --> 00:02:45.350
school, you have the option to not go back to school.

40
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.140
<v 0>I really do would want to go back to school.</v>

41
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.350
But at the same time I have to commute to school.

42
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.110
<v 2>Yeah. I agree with you, Charlie. I want to go back,</v>

43
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.260
but I have to take three buses, public transportation.

44
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.210
I'm not for that right now. The hybrid schedule half will go in Monday, Tuesday,

45
00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:02.860
the other half we'll go in Wednesday, Thursday.

46
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:07.450
Everyone's home Friday for me to plan is unacceptable because about the kids who

47
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:11.050
aren't going in, like, what do we do? I feel like right now online school,

48
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.390
is it being part of the solution?

49
00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:17.320
It's almost just like a punishment for like the government not taking enough

50
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:22.000
steps. I live in Nebraska and we were like the last city out of the biggest,

51
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:24.460
like a hundred cities to like get a mask mandate.

52
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.930
They said we were going to go back. And then like a week before school started,

53
00:03:28.931 --> 00:03:31.240
they like completely changed their mind,

54
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.520
which in my opinion was like a good thing to do.

55
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.490
Cause like our numbers are just like, keep going up.

56
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.790
The schools are acting like they know what's happening, but like deep down,

57
00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:43.330
like it's like clear that they have no clue either. Yeah,

58
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.950
I totally agree.

59
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.030
Because the teacher's union is so strong where I'm from the teachers wanting to

60
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:51.280
stay home. It's overpowering. The students needs,

61
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.830
they gave us the first month off to prepare.

62
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.800
But then that only resulted in them throwing a fit.

63
00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:58.090
He worked for the rest of your money.

64
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.500
You need to adapt the medium and serve your students. I don't care.

65
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.300
That happens. I do agree with that at the same time,

66
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.330
that teaches all also an enormous amount of stress.

67
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.010
I definitely want to go back,

68
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.400
but I haven't seen firsthand how China dealt with it.

69
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.150
It's like coming back to the U S infection rate is incredibly high.

70
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.510
Having tested a fifth of the people to me, it's too steady.

71
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.450
And if every single kid went back to school,

72
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.820
I have missed out on major life milestones because of the pandemic

73
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.580
three, two, one

74
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.950
the summer after your junior year,

75
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:38.860
before your senior year is the one that's most important that colleges are going

76
00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:43.750
to look at. I've tried so hard to like get a job or volunteer. I can't,

77
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.310
it's so frustrating.

78
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.420
Cause I track and gymnastics and like captains on both those teams super,

79
00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:54.280
super excited to be a captain just like really turned everything upside

80
00:04:54.281 --> 00:04:55.300
down. It kind of sucks.

81
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.920
<v 3>I moved from my country about three years ago.</v>

82
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.200
I was a lot of stuff behind everyone else.

83
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.590
I literally learned about college application. Last year,

84
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.880
this year I was going to do all those things that people started doing freshman

85
00:05:08.881 --> 00:05:12.150
year, but because of the pandemic was everything got canceled.

86
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.070
And I was very sad. I felt like I was even more step behind everyone else.

87
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.193
<v 2>Or where you're from.</v>

88
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.460
<v 3>I'm from Venezuela.</v>

89
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.023
<v 2>I was.</v>

90
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.010
<v 3>Well for me when I was leaving there,</v>

91
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.780
the lie would just not work nor water or not good internet connection.

92
00:05:30.781 --> 00:05:34.290
And they are doing, um, only school. So it is a mess, but I'm glad I'm.

93
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.920
<v 2>Yeah. First of all, you're so brave for like leaving your country.</v>

94
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.820
I'm a first generation and my family had to go through something similar to you.

95
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.450
You're the best. So the main thing I missed out on was the musical,

96
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.840
which was crushing because I've been wanting to be in it since first grade.

97
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.650
Once I actually thought about it, I was actually kind of miserable at school.

98
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.100
Um, I was always the black sheep of migraines. So to not get weird.

99
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.940
<v 1>Stares is like, Oh my God, I'm actually a person who matters.</v>

100
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.160
It's actually been quite good for my mental health.

101
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.340
I have experienced mental health issues due to the pandemic

102
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.340
three, two, one.

103
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:22.090
<v 3>This pandemic was extremely damaging to my mental health</v>

104
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.070
on so many different levels.

105
00:06:24.071 --> 00:06:27.100
And black lives matter movement was like hitting headlines again. Um,

106
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.690
because of the death of George Floyd,

107
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.260
it was very uncomfortable for me because I had people like DM-ing me personally,

108
00:06:32.261 --> 00:06:36.520
like questions, Oh gosh, it makes me cringe. What can I do?

109
00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:39.550
How can I be a better person? I don't understand what's going on.

110
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.620
And I was like, I understand that because you know,

111
00:06:41.621 --> 00:06:43.810
some people just don't truly know what's going on in the world.

112
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.660
But being like the little girl I am like,

113
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.840
I didn't know how to explain to people why my life matters.

114
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.930
And then not to mention with my school, I was asked like,

115
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.860
how do we help make our students of color more comfortable? I was just like,

116
00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.690
shouldn't I already be comfortable. Like,

117
00:06:58.691 --> 00:07:00.400
I feel like it should be a space for everyone.

118
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.520
You shouldn't have to like accommodate to me. And then that moment,

119
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.750
like I realized that some people who claim to be my friends warrant, they saw,

120
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.690
um, the black lives matter movement more as like a trend. So I was like,

121
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.850
kind of telling everyone, please just give me some space.

122
00:07:12.851 --> 00:07:16.090
I'm really overwhelmed. I don't know how to process this. Like as teenagers,

123
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.150
like I feel like we shouldn't have to have like a care in the world,

124
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.640
but it almost feels as if so much stuff has been like shoved at us that it's

125
00:07:24.641 --> 00:07:26.740
like, we don't know how to deal with this.

126
00:07:26.741 --> 00:07:29.950
And it feels like we have to deal with this like way sooner than we should like

127
00:07:29.951 --> 00:07:30.880
have to deal with it.

128
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.130
<v 2>My country is basically a bubble.</v>

129
00:07:33.131 --> 00:07:36.370
You don't realize you are in that bubble until you get out of that.

130
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:41.080
They are worried for other things that thankfully we don't have to worry about

131
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.730
like if you're safe or if you were

132
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:50.890
going to eat something tomorrow. So when I came here,

133
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:55.240
I realized he knew years have more time and more

134
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:59.980
rights and platforms to voice what they want to say.

135
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:04.630
And a lot of people are watching them and listen to them while in my

136
00:08:04.631 --> 00:08:06.850
country just cannot do that.

137
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:07.330
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

138
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:11.380
And that's why I feel like this quarantine is maybe taking us out of that and

139
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:16.000
sort of opening our eyes like 20, 20, 20, 20 vision.

140
00:08:16.001 --> 00:08:17.560
Like that's what I think of.

141
00:08:17.561 --> 00:08:22.420
We're sort of realizing that we aren't going to like stick through

142
00:08:22.421 --> 00:08:26.080
with this system and we really need to be like living our lives. At some point,

143
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.400
I think the us is handling the pandemic properly.

144
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.850
Three, two, one,

145
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.650
no, not at all.

146
00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:44.710
The government failed their class. You should be kicked out of the classroom.

147
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.570
Like we need a refresher here.

148
00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.720
<v 3>Our state is practically just a cornfield.</v>

149
00:08:49.721 --> 00:08:54.550
People think that like the world doesn't like reach us exactly a

150
00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.250
week ago, a mask mandate.

151
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.700
<v 2>Like finally in my city, it's not being enforced like at all,</v>

152
00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:03.900
like our own like governor is against it now more than ever like

153
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.330
change needs to happen.

154
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.770
And that change can happen November 3rd, everybody go out.

155
00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.360
Yeah. They basically did everything that they could wrong.

156
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.090
First after that the politician decide what, uh,

157
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.800
motion should we pass and what should it be?

158
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.680
And then they let it go down to the local and state levels.

159
00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.870
So you can't make a uniform decision. And the,

160
00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:28.520
at least the people themselves who were like, no, what my light is,

161
00:09:28.521 --> 00:09:31.280
I don't have to wear a mask. So I'm not going to wear it.

162
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.800
And then for people in China, my feds were like,

163
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:36.440
what in the world are they thinking? Are they out of their minds?

164
00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:40.520
And for them to say, this is, this is the pinnacle of a Medicaid,

165
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.720
like from the outside bullet, this is America at its best. They, okay.

166
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:45.590
It's worse.

167
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.520
I noticed that we're holding Australia on New Zealand on such a pedestal.

168
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.540
However,

169
00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:54.650
I get a little fishy because they have crazy curfews and they're installing

170
00:09:54.651 --> 00:09:56.420
cameras to track their citizens.

171
00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.880
Like it's extremely important to protect people,

172
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.270
but like the people will question things. They do have a point,

173
00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.900
like how much of our personal freedom are we going to sacrifice for this virus?

174
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:09.470
What rights am I willing to have stripped away throughout history when rights

175
00:10:09.471 --> 00:10:12.140
are taken away, they don't typically come back. I mean,

176
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:17.810
you can pack the social distancing 110%. Correct. And have all of you, like,

177
00:10:17.811 --> 00:10:20.510
you can still talk on social media, right? Like,

178
00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:25.730
no nobody's picked lodged gatherings. Well, dude, it's a pandemic. I mean,

179
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:28.970
it's sorta like, that's exactly what you're not supposed to do.

180
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:30.620
I think levels to it though.

181
00:10:30.621 --> 00:10:35.450
I think it's very fair that like there are certain levels and degrees into

182
00:10:35.451 --> 00:10:37.340
which it's like, Oh,

183
00:10:37.341 --> 00:10:40.460
well that's like a little aggressive.

184
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.720
One of the reasons why America has struggled so much with mandates and

185
00:10:44.721 --> 00:10:49.550
everything is that people believe so strongly in the idea of personal freedom.

186
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:54.230
They don't understand that in order to have personal freedom.

187
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.630
And in order to live in a society, you have to give up other things.

188
00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:02.990
The pandemic has affected my future plans. Three,

189
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.880
two, one.

190
00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.950
Before when I was younger, I was like,

191
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:13.640
I'm going to go to USC film school and I'm going to become a film director.

192
00:11:13.641 --> 00:11:15.200
And I was just like, that's my goal,

193
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.980
but I don't really know how what's going to happen after high school,

194
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:23.090
but I'm also have faith that whatever happens I'll be happy with.

195
00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.420
And then I just found out recently that like USC is handing out free tuition.

196
00:11:26.421 --> 00:11:29.560
And I actually may have an opportunity if I get in to pursue that.

197
00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.450
I have no clue what I want to do with my life,

198
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.650
which is so hard for me because growing up, like I wanted to be a singer.

199
00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.200
I want to be an edge just because I wanted to be a criminal justice defense

200
00:11:39.201 --> 00:11:42.530
attorney. I have no clue where I want to go.

201
00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:46.580
But I do believe in me and is manifest manifestation,

202
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:50.540
manifesting, I believe in manifestation.

203
00:11:50.541 --> 00:11:54.040
So if I know that I'm going to end up good.

204
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.140
<v 3>I'm going to look at that. I'm going to be great.</v>

205
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.350
It's just that I don't know what I'm going to be great in it.

206
00:11:58.351 --> 00:11:59.800
And I'm okay with it. I'm okay.

207
00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:05.430
<v 2>Snaps for that. Very well said very well said.</v>

208
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:10.200
That is it for our conversation. Thank you guys. Good.

209
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.300
It was so nice talking to you all.

210
00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:18.300
Should we all chat like our Instagram handles? Yes. That

211
00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:23.190
is so long. You can change it, you know? Oh, wait.
