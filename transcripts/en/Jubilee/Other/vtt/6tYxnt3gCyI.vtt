00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.610
<v 0>Saying the word of God is not absolute or sovereign. You already have an agenda.</v>

2
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.000
You're trying to fit the Bible into that agenda. Without the gospel,

3
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.880
people are going to help. And that's a very serious issue,

4
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.820
more serious than sexual orientation or a boarded baby.

5
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.403
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

6
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.130
<v 0>It says in Romans that if you confess with the mouth and believe in the heart,</v>

7
00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:35.060
that Jesus is Lord, then you will surely be saved, praying, reading your Bible.

8
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.130
I think following the commandments is a minimum.

9
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.600
<v 2>Someone who tries to reflect God's love in their life.</v>

10
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.930
<v 1>Welcoming people to love each other and be compassionate.</v>

11
00:00:44.931 --> 00:00:48.290
And listen is essentially what Jesus asked us to do.

12
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.610
<v 0>When we're approaching different topics like homosexuality,</v>

13
00:00:52.611 --> 00:00:54.050
or like pro-choice pro-life.

14
00:00:54.051 --> 00:00:56.390
We have to go into them thinking about what the Bible says.

15
00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.130
<v 1>I would prefer to have the world or society or culture or their peers dictate</v>

16
00:01:01.131 --> 00:01:05.060
their life. There are rules that are associated with being progressive.

17
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.400
The problem comes in when people try to create unnecessary

18
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:11.683
boundaries.

19
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:23.240
[inaudible].

20
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.890
<v 0>I'm angel. I'm a worship leader and I'm excited to be here. I am Jason.</v>

21
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.790
I'm the YouTuber known as pastor Jason answers. I'm happy to be here.

22
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.540
<v 1>I'm Siara um, I do hair and I work with children.</v>

23
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.570
<v 2>Hi, I'm Olivia. I'm a college student.</v>

24
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.820
<v 1>Hello. My name is Kurt. I am a senior pastor. I am Brenda.</v>

25
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.160
I am the YouTuber known as God is gray.

26
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.030
And I'm so excited to have a civilized conversation with you all

27
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.180
step forward. If you agree with the statement,

28
00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.550
the Republican party embodies Christian values more

29
00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:03.260
than the democratic party.

30
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.760
<v 0>I don't know a whole bunch about politics,</v>

31
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.540
but when I see like pro-life things like that,

32
00:02:17.541 --> 00:02:22.130
I would have to just deduce from that, that Republican is more Christ centered,

33
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.400
right? I'm not talking about big government versus small government regulation.

34
00:02:25.401 --> 00:02:29.450
I'll talk about specifically, pro-life talking about education,

35
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.480
public education of transgender. I'm talking about marriage.

36
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.040
<v 2>I grew up in a very conservative far right church.</v>

37
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.070
I used to be a Trump supporter, although I wasn't even,

38
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.660
I'm not even a us citizen,

39
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.760
but one thing that really hurt me and changed my perspective was

40
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.950
how they talk about immigration and poor people like

41
00:02:54.951 --> 00:02:55.700
myself.

42
00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.490
I grew up in poverty and planned Parenthood is my PCP because

43
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.920
they take Medicaid.

44
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.000
But when I found out that my friends actually, um,

45
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.240
the silent protest in front of planned Parenthood,

46
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.310
that really changed my perspective a lot,

47
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.930
like over 75% of people who get abortion are low

48
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.670
income. I like you have been in not poverty,

49
00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:24.190
but in situations where I couldn't afford health insurance,

50
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.180
universal health care is the most Christ-like thing I can imagine.

51
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:30.460
It's it's full of compassion. It's saying, yeah,

52
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:32.260
maybe you have to take this out of my pocket,

53
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.920
but it's for the poor who can't afford it. I'm like that's Jesus to me.

54
00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:38.040
I don't see what's going on there.

55
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.170
<v 0>In regards to abortion specifically.</v>

56
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.040
I do think that that is someone's future in there.

57
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.630
And I think that the choice between if that future has played out or not as

58
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.260
gods,

59
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.010
and I take that from Psalms where it says that his eyes saw our substance being

60
00:03:53.011 --> 00:03:56.430
yet informed and he fashioned our days when yet there were none of them.

61
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.360
And so the moment at conception, when that baby exists,

62
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.690
no matter how small they are, their whole future is lined up.

63
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.010
And I know that sometimes circumstances on how those babies come about suck and

64
00:04:08.011 --> 00:04:11.370
I've met someone that was a product of that, okay?

65
00:04:11.371 --> 00:04:16.110
Their biological father raped their mother and she doesn't know who her

66
00:04:16.111 --> 00:04:20.880
biological father is, but I just couldn't, I couldn't imagine life without her.

67
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.830
<v 3>What about the mother that finds out that she's pregnant and she goes to the</v>

68
00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:28.890
hospital and they tell her that it's a high risk pregnancy.

69
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.900
And that if she does take the baby to term that she runs the risk

70
00:04:33.901 --> 00:04:36.570
of, of giving birth and actually dying.

71
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.800
<v 0>I think that in those circumstances, in those situations,</v>

72
00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:41.880
I think that they should trust.

73
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.300
<v 3>The Lord. So what if the Lord tells him to have an abortion?</v>

74
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.530
<v 0>I'm just going to have to say, trust the Lord. And I'm not a woman.</v>

75
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.600
I will never be put in that place. So.

76
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.820
<v 3>I asked that because I have a, I have a friend that his daughter,</v>

77
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.250
um, went through that and he chose his daughter over the

78
00:05:02.251 --> 00:05:03.084
baby.

79
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.950
And so they ended up having an abortion and he was pro-life prior to

80
00:05:07.951 --> 00:05:09.930
that circumstance.

81
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.830
<v 1>I would still trust God. I think if I was in that situation,</v>

82
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:19.020
I would pray with my husband and call on my church and my family let's

83
00:05:19.021 --> 00:05:22.620
come together and pray about this. And whatever God like God's will,

84
00:05:22.621 --> 00:05:24.120
will be done. If my life be taken,

85
00:05:24.121 --> 00:05:27.690
then I pray that this baby will be used and that he would give me the comfort

86
00:05:27.691 --> 00:05:29.460
and the peace to get through that situation.

87
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.050
<v 2>LGBTQ plus couples should be allowed to get married in the</v>

88
00:05:37.051 --> 00:05:37.884
church

89
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.680
Personally. I think they should be able to,

90
00:05:49.681 --> 00:05:53.280
because they can have a marriage that glorifies God,

91
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.070
just like any straight couples can. Well, I do believe that homosexuality.

92
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.540
<v 1>Is a sin. I can't tell you what you can can or can't do with your life.</v>

93
00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:06.230
And I do think that you should have the same rights that I have in the same way

94
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:08.660
that I have the right to believe differently.

95
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.180
I have to also extend that right to you.

96
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.890
<v 4>Well, I'm married to a wonderful man. And so, um,</v>

97
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.540
so of course I would have to agree with the LGBTQ, um,

98
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.850
be allowed to get married in the church.

99
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.500
<v 5>When I was deep in evangelicalism, the narrative was being gay as a sin.</v>

100
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.570
And then I saw the church sort of like soften up or change the narrative to

101
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.420
okay, being gay. Isn't a sin. God made you gay,

102
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.700
but you can never act on homosexuality. That's the sin in the act. But again,

103
00:06:39.701 --> 00:06:41.200
I don't see the harm.

104
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.830
I see beautiful couples like this gentleman here.

105
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.680
So when we look at suicidal ideation,

106
00:06:47.681 --> 00:06:51.610
we look at trans women being murdered because of the bigotry in this nation,

107
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:55.930
a lot propagated by Christians, evangelicals,

108
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.530
conservatives, the fruit of that doctrine.

109
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.530
We've been planting for not only decades, but centuries.

110
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.340
<v 4>First, what LGBTQ people do with their lives is none of my business.</v>

111
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.270
And I believe they should have the same rights as other couples do in terms of

112
00:07:13.271 --> 00:07:18.160
government assistance, uh, freedoms of tax benefits, of course,

113
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.440
that there should be no discrimination,

114
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.440
but when they come to the church and they're saying,

115
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:27.400
can you approve our marriage before God?

116
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:31.600
I can't disregard what I believe the Bible says and say, Oh,

117
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.020
forget what the Bible says. So that could be more accepting of people.

118
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.970
I respect totally as individuals as

119
00:07:39.971 --> 00:07:43.990
Americans. I think you have rights. However,

120
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.980
I have to go based off of the Bible and the Bible equates homosexuality to

121
00:07:47.981 --> 00:07:52.600
sexual immorality. And so I care about you guys, as,

122
00:07:52.601 --> 00:07:55.630
as people that that's not gonna, that's not gonna make me justify.

123
00:07:55.631 --> 00:07:59.220
I know that you mentioned like murders and suicide rates. I,

124
00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.630
I don't agree with any of that. And I think that's terrible.

125
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.790
<v 5>But why do you think those are happening?</v>

126
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.480
You can no longer say I that's horrible.

127
00:08:07.481 --> 00:08:12.430
What's happening over there because this theology is the basis

128
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:17.440
of that suicidal ideation. In many cases, it is the basis of transphobia.

129
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:18.370
In many cases,

130
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:22.750
if you see all of this atrocious pain we're causing the LGBTQ plus community,

131
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.110
then we need to look at the plank in our own eye and say, wait,

132
00:08:26.111 --> 00:08:27.770
why is this happening? There's a.

133
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.870
<v 1>It mentions all of the people who won't enter the kingdom of heaven.</v>

134
00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.940
And I can talk about what Leviticus says about homosexuality or the people who

135
00:08:36.941 --> 00:08:40.210
engage in that. But I just base off as Christians.

136
00:08:40.211 --> 00:08:44.620
If our goal is to get to heaven. I know that if I'm a drunk,

137
00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.950
I know if I'm a foreigner cater. I know if I'm an adulterer, if I'm homeless,

138
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.730
living a homosexual lifestyle, I will not enter the kingdom of heaven.

139
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.470
That's what the Bible says.

140
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.250
<v 4>The word, homosexuality not even.</v>

141
00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.170
<v 3>Entered into biblical texts until probably like the</v>

142
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:02.480
1900.

143
00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.990
<v 2>And the original texts are Santa coy, Thai and mallow.</v>

144
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.300
Koi are in our English rendition. It says homosexuality.

145
00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:15.560
But those literally translate to pedophilia it's relationship between an older

146
00:09:15.561 --> 00:09:16.550
man and his young son.

147
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:17.571
<v 4>Verses that, say,</v>

148
00:09:17.571 --> 00:09:21.380
a man shall not sleep with another man for it is an abomination that

149
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:24.620
there's no word for homosexuality.

150
00:09:24.621 --> 00:09:26.870
And Matt is just no dudes sleep with other dude.

151
00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.800
I can see how you can see that relating to first Timothy passage.

152
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.860
But if you look at Romans chapter one, verse 26 and 27,

153
00:09:33.861 --> 00:09:37.630
it's clearly in context is talking about quote, unquote unnatural relationship.

154
00:09:37.631 --> 00:09:39.530
It doesn't say homosexual,

155
00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.380
but it's talking about men having committing acts with them.

156
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:46.490
<v 3>Yeah. Well, the problem with that is that.</v>

157
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.970
So in Romans that's Paul writing, right?

158
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.570
And so Paul is writing. Yes, no, it was Paul writing.

159
00:09:59.570 --> 00:09:59.700
[inaudible].

160
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:04.040
<v 2>Letters to churches. God's saying it's not the same thing.</v>

161
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.260
<v 3>No, no, no. You didn't let me finish because</v>

162
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.540
the text says natural affection. Well,

163
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:15.050
my natural affection is not towards a woman.

164
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:17.420
My natural affection is towards a man.

165
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:22.130
<v 4>Are dividing things in the Bible and progressives want to get rid of that</v>

166
00:10:22.131 --> 00:10:25.040
because they want to focus on God loves you,

167
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.560
accepts you and puts his arms around you.

168
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:32.540
But in the process have also watered down the gospel also, uh,

169
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.540
deleted some things that they know what the Bible says,

170
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.920
and because we don't want to cast people away.

171
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.840
So I love that heart.

172
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.320
But I think in the process of watering down the gospel,

173
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:49.100
you've set the bar so low that do they even see the real guy?

174
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.690
<v 3>You have to be very careful when we talk about the literalism of the Bible.</v>

175
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:58.010
Because if we do that, then basically everyone in this room is saying,

176
00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.600
because we have mixed tweets.

177
00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.380
<v 4>Do we know the context of Leviticus? Yes. I know the context of it.</v>

178
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.260
<v 2>Context and little bit, but not contact.</v>

179
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.720
<v 4>Well, no. What I'm saying is Leviticus.</v>

180
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:12.560
The law that came was for the people of Israel when they were rescued from the

181
00:11:12.561 --> 00:11:16.280
captivity of Egypt. But we see in Jeremiah 31 31,

182
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.730
that the Lord says that he will build a new covenant under the house of Judah

183
00:11:19.731 --> 00:11:21.800
and under the house of Israel, which is still scripture.

184
00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.780
So if we go based off of what we see in Exodus and Leviticus, that law has gone.

185
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.540
<v 2>You're allowing for context in history, which you don't allow for.</v>

186
00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:34.250
That's not fair. I've gone through some sort of conversion therapy myself.

187
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:39.380
Although they called it counseling to serve as a leader or to

188
00:11:39.381 --> 00:11:41.180
serve in different department.

189
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:45.470
And I always questioned why are divorced people

190
00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:48.650
able to serve and do things?

191
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.460
And it's not really a big of a deal in most churches.

192
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:57.010
Whereas a lot of churches, they have a statement of faith that says, if you,

193
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.000
if you disagree with our, um, marriage,

194
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.540
or like the traditional marriage model, you can not serve.

195
00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:09.460
I've never heard any pastor telling someone who's divorced to go back to

196
00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:13.750
their ex-husband or ex-wife like, they say, it's the same level of sin,

197
00:12:13.751 --> 00:12:16.990
but how come this people are like, okay, and this people are not.

198
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.550
So that's the problem. I see.

199
00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.250
<v 4>I'm not going to be a literal list here,</v>

200
00:12:20.251 --> 00:12:24.450
but please don't be offended because I do admire your courage in coming out.

201
00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.960
But I believe homosexuals will not be in heaven.

202
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.580
I believe homosexuals transgenders people break the speed limit.

203
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:33.900
We'll all go to heaven.

204
00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:38.130
If they put their faith in Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and savior. But,

205
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.760
but when they get to heaven, they will no longer be homosexuals.

206
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:43.350
There was no longer be law breakers.

207
00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:47.580
They will no longer be drunks based on first Corinthians six first nine.

208
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:52.650
We can actually see what God's will is clearly based on what it is in heaven.

209
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:58.320
<v 0>So when it comes to tendencies with homosexuality,</v>

210
00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:02.430
that's something that I've dealt with since I was very young. However,

211
00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:06.210
I don't choose to identify with those tendencies that are within me.

212
00:13:06.211 --> 00:13:08.850
I choose to identify with what the Bible declares that I am.

213
00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:13.680
<v 3>And are you miserable? No. No, not at all. You're not. No,</v>

214
00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.540
because the joy of the Lord is my strain.

215
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.880
<v 2>Could I ask a, an invasive question? You can say now, are you bisexual?</v>

216
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:26.280
<v 0>No, there's a big possibility. I may never get married. Okay.</v>

217
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.570
<v 3>There's a big possibility. You may never get married because of what.</v>

218
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:35.310
<v 0>Because I choose to trust in the Lord and I choose to do as the scripture says</v>

219
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:36.530
and believe as the scripture.

220
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:41.130
<v 3>So do you have inclinations and desires to like,</v>

221
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.090
to be with a guy.

222
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.600
<v 0>Have desires and inclinations to follow the voice of the Lord?</v>

223
00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.520
<v 3>And I, and I respect that. Like I honestly did.</v>

224
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.760
<v 2>That's a lot of self-control to say, basically you're down to the,</v>

225
00:13:53.761 --> 00:13:54.630
have a life of self.

226
00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.240
<v 0>I was kinda nervous that we'll talk about it a little bit,</v>

227
00:13:57.241 --> 00:14:01.950
but I feel like it's a topic that's a lot more in the dark when it comes to the

228
00:14:01.951 --> 00:14:03.150
church. And I don't know,

229
00:14:03.151 --> 00:14:06.810
I just feel like we need to move forward in a different approach than the way

230
00:14:06.811 --> 00:14:08.670
we've been going, because it does break my heart,

231
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.340
seeing people committing suicide and,

232
00:14:11.341 --> 00:14:15.810
and hearing about some of the violent conclusions that some people's lives have

233
00:14:15.811 --> 00:14:16.644
gotten to.

234
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:21.360
I feel like if anybody has any reason to find like an

235
00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:26.250
explanation for how I could get around scripture and marry a male,

236
00:14:26.251 --> 00:14:29.070
it just, I just can't. I, I.

237
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:29.730
<v 2>Okay.</v>

238
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:33.630
Could I also just ask you where you received that message for the first time.

239
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:38.670
<v 0>Some people in church that would say like, you know, that that was a choice.</v>

240
00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:43.500
And I realized that I had no control over what I like or what I

241
00:14:43.501 --> 00:14:46.080
don't like, literally I don't. And I can agree with you with that.

242
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:50.190
I think the choice comes in is choosing to identify with those beliefs and

243
00:14:50.191 --> 00:14:52.400
choosing to identify with tendencies.

244
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.850
<v 4>Inside of you. That's where I believe it becomes.</v>

245
00:14:55.450 --> 00:15:00.190
<v 3>For me. I try to suppress that. Um, for a years, I, you know,</v>

246
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:02.110
um, I had a girlfriend, I, I,

247
00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:06.070
I did all of these different things and it was like, Oh no, it's a sin.

248
00:15:06.071 --> 00:15:11.020
It's that? But I had a relevatory moment when the

249
00:15:11.021 --> 00:15:14.740
church was mean to me, put him over here.

250
00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.830
We don't want them with anybody, kick him out, do that.

251
00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:22.480
It wasn't no one showed me the authentic love of Christ.

252
00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:25.360
But you know, who showed me the authentic level of Christ,

253
00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.870
my friends who were gay,

254
00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:32.080
I had to go to counseling because of what the church did to me.

255
00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.350
And the counselor is the one who was not a Christian,

256
00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:39.820
helped me to understand people in the church hurt you,

257
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:43.600
not God. And so, because God did not hurt me,

258
00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:48.250
I could stand in a church and get married to a man because God did not hurt me.

259
00:15:48.251 --> 00:15:53.080
I can stand up every Sunday and preach to transgender, straight people,

260
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.943
gay people.

261
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:58.930
I can do all of that because of the authenticity of who and what I

262
00:15:58.931 --> 00:16:00.760
know God is.

263
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:03.303
<v 1>Jesus.</v>

264
00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:06.370
<v 4>Protest for the black lives matter movement.</v>

265
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:15.970
<v 3>Jesus cares so much about everyone that I think that</v>

266
00:16:15.971 --> 00:16:20.140
he, he may, we see him making stance stances,

267
00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.580
um, especially in the synoptic gospels, you know, throughout texts.

268
00:16:24.581 --> 00:16:27.580
We see him like actually standing up for people.

269
00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.220
<v 4>The gospel is not about black lives matter,</v>

270
00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.640
but Jesus often stood up for those who are oppressed for those who are

271
00:16:33.641 --> 00:16:35.560
discarded. Those were marginalized.

272
00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:40.390
I'm not saying everything about the black lives matter is perfect or good as if

273
00:16:40.391 --> 00:16:45.160
any movement is, but he would stand up for those who are voiceless. Yeah.

274
00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:46.023
I think Jesus.

275
00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:50.320
<v 5>Foot protest for the lives of one lost sheep.</v>

276
00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.340
My struggle with not stepping forward was really like,

277
00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:01.900
we all have a different voice and a way that we can protest in a way that would

278
00:17:01.901 --> 00:17:04.210
be best. Like I had a newborn child,

279
00:17:04.211 --> 00:17:07.300
so I couldn't get out on the streets because of Corona. Like,

280
00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:10.150
that's why I wasn't there. So anyone that wasn't there,

281
00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:14.410
I wouldn't say was on the wrong side of history it's but it was like,

282
00:17:14.411 --> 00:17:16.930
what are you doing to actively advocate in your life?

283
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:20.110
Or you're educating yourself about white supremacy?

284
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.080
Are you becoming actively anti-racist.

285
00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:26.500
<v 1>I wouldn't envision like Jesus out there with like a sign,</v>

286
00:17:26.501 --> 00:17:28.450
because I do believe that black lives matter.

287
00:17:28.451 --> 00:17:29.950
I do believe that all lives matter,

288
00:17:29.951 --> 00:17:34.240
but I don't think I need to protest in order for me

289
00:17:34.241 --> 00:17:35.074
to.

290
00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:40.330
<v 3>Prove that you have to remember that this same Jesus whooped the hell out of a</v>

291
00:17:40.331 --> 00:17:42.430
temple because,

292
00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.870
because they were in there doing things that, that they, um,

293
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.760
that they should not have been doing.

294
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:53.820
And we see him go in and be very vengeful in his approach of turning,

295
00:17:53.821 --> 00:17:58.410
flipping over tables and doing different things to protest that

296
00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:02.400
God's house was supposed to be a house of prayer and that they had made it into

297
00:18:02.401 --> 00:18:03.300
a den of thieves.

298
00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.940
<v 4>I mean, I get it historically,</v>

299
00:18:04.941 --> 00:18:08.060
if this happened in the first century in something like a black lives matter was

300
00:18:08.061 --> 00:18:08.780
happening,

301
00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.330
I don't think Jesus would be part of that because that was not part of his

302
00:18:11.331 --> 00:18:12.320
mission. That's not,

303
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:17.570
but today what Jesus want me to be part of it as he's living his life

304
00:18:17.571 --> 00:18:21.770
through me, then I would answer yes. To stand up for those who are oppressing.

305
00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:27.020
<v 1>The other side, misrepresents Christianity.</v>

306
00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.490
<v 5>I feel misrepresented in that. Um,</v>

307
00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:42.380
I often say that the evangelical or conservative church has built an idol to

308
00:18:42.381 --> 00:18:45.110
sexual purity and sexual integrity,

309
00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:48.530
which is why the gay issue is so high on the agenda.

310
00:18:48.531 --> 00:18:53.390
And the pro-choice pro-life issue. The Bible is not a sex manual,

311
00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:58.130
but so often I see it being presented as like the utmost issue

312
00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.750
and what we're talking about earlier about social justice and all of these other

313
00:19:02.751 --> 00:19:05.900
beautiful things that I believe Jesus would be a part of, you know,

314
00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:09.620
Jesus himself was not harping on people's sexuality constantly.

315
00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:15.080
<v 1>I think a lot of people turn to the progressive side because they're hurt by the</v>

316
00:19:15.081 --> 00:19:18.200
church and what the church did to them and how the church treated them.

317
00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:23.150
It's showing people come as you are and stay as you are instead of

318
00:19:23.151 --> 00:19:27.890
come as you are and let God change you and let God work in you to

319
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:30.650
not live the way you were before,

320
00:19:30.651 --> 00:19:34.790
but to change and have a new life and become a new creation

321
00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.550
and join me in heaven.

322
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.930
<v 4>Well, I feel misrepresented because like you said,</v>

323
00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:46.160
you think it's about the issues like sexuality or social justice.

324
00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:51.200
I feel like because they want to accept it because they want people to know

325
00:19:51.201 --> 00:19:55.430
about the love of God. They're misrepresenting the love of God.

326
00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.850
And that's what conservatives care about the word of God and the gospel.

327
00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:02.930
<v 5>Again, I go back to like the inerrancy of scripture,</v>

328
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:04.670
which I see a lot in conservative church.

329
00:20:04.671 --> 00:20:07.910
I do not believe the words of Paul are the words of God.

330
00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:11.870
And that's definitely where we veer off for a lot of people. That's a big thing.

331
00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:14.960
Like we believe that just all scripture, including that,

332
00:20:14.961 --> 00:20:17.720
which Paul wrote was inspired by God. And so, no,

333
00:20:17.721 --> 00:20:20.690
I believe it's all inspired by God, but I don't believe it's literally God,

334
00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:25.130
the only reason I'm going in on this is to clarify that we love and honor the

335
00:20:25.131 --> 00:20:29.150
Bible too. We really do. I read my Bible every single day.

336
00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:32.780
And I think that is the thing that most conservatives don't understand about.

337
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.510
Progressive's more than anything. Welcome.

338
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:41.630
<v 3>Are ambiguities of like this and that. And our, this is the way you see it.</v>

339
00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:45.560
That's an age old thing. If you go back and you look,

340
00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.930
that's why Martin Luther posted the 95 thesis on the

341
00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:51.010
Catholic church,

342
00:20:51.011 --> 00:20:55.750
because he had all of these issues or all of these problems with what they

343
00:20:55.751 --> 00:20:58.990
thought religiously. And he goes on and to start the Lutheran church.

344
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:03.850
And then like, um, my sister said, we read the same Bible. We,

345
00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:07.330
I get up. And I re I read that study my Bible every week.

346
00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:12.600
<v 2>Progressive Christianity is seeing the Christianity that we grew up in</v>

347
00:21:12.601 --> 00:21:15.870
and then seeing a problem and that we realize, okay, let's fix it.

348
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:19.020
So we come up with new ideas and new ways to fix it.

349
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.830
But based on the scripture that we all grew up reading.

350
00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:26.880
<v 4>When I, when I pastor my church and they're having a hard time understanding the</v>

351
00:21:26.881 --> 00:21:30.540
scriptures, I'm gentle with them because they're trying to learn.

352
00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:35.910
But I feel like it'd be harsh with progressive Christians. Because if they,

353
00:21:35.911 --> 00:21:39.720
if you claim to be a Christian, you should know better. And I believe,

354
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:44.610
especially after this talk, you don't know how to interpret the word.

355
00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:48.660
You are dishonoring God, because you are not doing his will. Now.

356
00:21:48.661 --> 00:21:52.650
I firmly believe that because saying the word of God is not absolute or

357
00:21:52.651 --> 00:21:53.484
sovereign.

358
00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.760
You're saying you're picking and choosing based on your interpretations.

359
00:21:56.761 --> 00:21:58.710
I think your hermeneutics is off.

360
00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:02.130
See that my church members are trying to learn.

361
00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.010
It seems like you already have an agenda.

362
00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:08.940
You're trying to fit the Bible into that agenda instead of accepting the gospel

363
00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:12.390
for what it is that without the gospel, people are going to help.

364
00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.950
And that's a very serious issue,

365
00:22:13.951 --> 00:22:17.130
more serious than sexual orientation or aborted babies.

366
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.450
And I think that's the key issue between conservatives and progressors.

367
00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:23.760
It's not a bathroom issues. It's about the word of God.

368
00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:27.960
And when you disrespect the word of God, like you are doing it.

369
00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.340
<v 3>Like Mr. POWs.</v>

370
00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:34.290
<v 4>Because your hermeneutics is wrong. Not necessarily.</v>

371
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:38.040
<v 0>Though. I probably wouldn't have said it as Kurt.</v>

372
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:42.270
I do believe that the gospel is essential above topics of,

373
00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:43.710
and though the church,

374
00:22:43.711 --> 00:22:47.640
hasn't done a great job with capitalizing on some sins and not really talking

375
00:22:47.641 --> 00:22:51.300
about the other, like I know that we mentioned divorce earlier. Um,

376
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:55.950
I do think the gospel is of primary importance. And I,

377
00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:57.750
I would have to second that,

378
00:22:57.751 --> 00:23:02.730
like my biggest thing is just like taking parts of scripture and then not taking

379
00:23:02.731 --> 00:23:05.040
the other. Um, but.

380
00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.100
<v 4>I would probably missed this Curt, but yeah.</v>

381
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.630
<v 3>As an African-American, we dealt with slavery.</v>

382
00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:18.120
And if you go back and you study history and you look at the,

383
00:23:18.121 --> 00:23:21.160
the history of black people, we were in doctrine,

384
00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:26.370
NYSED by the Bible, slaves obey your masters.

385
00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:31.500
And they indoctrinated that into us to, to keep us oppressed.

386
00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.260
When you talk about literalism, when it comes to scripture,

387
00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:38.970
you have to be very careful because if you, because if you do that,

388
00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:43.350
then, then you open up something that is catastrophic.

389
00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:46.760
<v 0>I think it's terrible that people scripture out of context,</v>

390
00:23:46.761 --> 00:23:50.540
because all man was created in the likeness of God, all men,

391
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:55.610
all men, all people. So when they were quoting verses about slavery,

392
00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.560
they disregarded what was said in Genesis.

393
00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:01.160
In the beginning that all people were created in the likeness of God.

394
00:24:01.161 --> 00:24:05.900
If all men were created in the image of God, then that's gay people.

395
00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:10.520
That's transgender people. That's, um, African-American people,

396
00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:14.570
that's Asian people. That's all you're talking about race,

397
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:18.260
sexual identity. Those are completely different. They're, they're idle.

398
00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:23.270
Here's the energy I choose to walk outside and identify as being black

399
00:24:23.271 --> 00:24:25.160
or not. I got black skin.

400
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:30.290
Whether I choose to identify with behaviors on how I feel is a completely

401
00:24:30.291 --> 00:24:31.310
different thing. Well,

402
00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.890
that's when you're going into a lifestyle and orientation and,

403
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:35.300
and that's an argument.

404
00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:39.730
<v 5>There is a danger. I agree in, in interpreting scripture,</v>

405
00:24:39.731 --> 00:24:43.810
literally because it can be so easily weaponized against people.

406
00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:48.370
Interracial marriage was illegal in this country until 1967.

407
00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:53.230
And there were Christian women protesting because white Christians thought it

408
00:24:53.231 --> 00:24:55.630
was unbiblical. And it was in the Bible.

409
00:24:55.631 --> 00:24:58.600
It was clear that we're not supposed to be mixing with other races.

410
00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:01.930
<v 1>I can't say you're going to hell. I can't say that.</v>

411
00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.730
Cause I don't know her relationship with God.

412
00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:05.920
And I can't say the same for you or you.

413
00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:09.130
And even between us as conservative Christians,

414
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:12.220
we identify a different belief systems.

415
00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:15.460
I think just this world is not our home.

416
00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:20.620
Our focus is on making it to heaven

417
00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:24.760
and doing what we can to get there and making sure that we're reaching people

418
00:25:24.761 --> 00:25:25.594
along the way,

419
00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:29.920
the church does need to do a better job of reaching people in a

420
00:25:29.921 --> 00:25:32.410
respectful, caring, loving way,

421
00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:37.000
not just throwing scripture down someone's throat are not just throwing

422
00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:40.900
standards or what they think is right.

423
00:25:40.901 --> 00:25:45.880
But what Jesus showed us to live by loving our neighbor as ourselves and to

424
00:25:45.881 --> 00:25:50.320
make connections with people and truly care about the person and the soul,

425
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:52.750
because this life is just temporary.
