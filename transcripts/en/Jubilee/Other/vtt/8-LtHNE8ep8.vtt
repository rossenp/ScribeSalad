1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.160
<v 0>People were really upset and men were really upset.</v>

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.890
<v 1>Like it's literally the closest thing I've ever heard of.</v>

3
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.070
Audio pornography heard a lot of men rap.

4
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.170
<v 0>It's aimed at young American girls. Can you even imagine what it's doing to that</v>

5
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.280
clean, wet P word, people are like, this is vulgar inappropriate.

6
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.350
What about the children that look up to them?

7
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.450
Do women achieve equality by aspiring to and replicating the

8
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.230
values that have been established by male? Try our best to enjoy it.

9
00:00:36.231 --> 00:00:41.180
But it's been a lot of politics that a female rabbit that'd be bad golf.

10
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.370
And Tommy talking about the dolphin us got not the one

11
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.353
that horny.

12
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.930
<v 2>My name is Brandy blaze.</v>

13
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.560
I primarily do a lot of trap music rooted in feminism.

14
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.350
It's really important for me as a fat black woman.

15
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.100
<v 0>That's Joey natto.</v>

16
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.790
<v 1>Again, most of my following from YouTube, I make positive.</v>

17
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.530
<v 0>Motivational music, hard to see through the lies. No, I don't get the picture.</v>

18
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.350
<v 2>I'm black Muslim and I care about activism.</v>

19
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.040
<v 0>My name is pinky ring [inaudible].</v>

20
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.420
I am an MEC and hip hop cultural ambassador for the United States.

21
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.040
I am queen Herbie.

22
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.290
The messages in my music are definitely centered around self care and building

23
00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:46.820
confidence and knowing your worth on the CNCS. If you lose such a pleasure.

24
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.550
<v 1>My name is Ruslana.</v>

25
00:01:48.551 --> 00:01:51.740
I'm a Christian and the vision for what I do is to encourage, empower,

26
00:01:51.741 --> 00:01:54.680
inspire people to live God's dream for their life.

27
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.040
<v 0>My name is Mike Savage. I represent weird kids like myself,</v>

28
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.440
who didn't necessarily fit in, in school and stuff.

29
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.860
And the first prompt is wrap should only send uplifting and

30
00:02:09.861 --> 00:02:14.150
meaningful messages. Brandy, I'm going to disagree,

31
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.410
Joey.

32
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.610
<v 1>I think I'll say strongly disagree. I actually disagree too.</v>

33
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.640
<v 0>Pinky, strongly disagree queen.</v>

34
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.350
I disagree or son agree. Some-odd.

35
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.560
<v 1>Strongly disagree as, as a father,</v>

36
00:02:30.561 --> 00:02:34.640
as someone who has kids as someone who has little nieces and sees the

37
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.380
consequences of there not being enough uplifting and meaningful music,

38
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.350
I think it should. I think there should be substantially more.

39
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.480
<v 2>I don't think that lyrics have to be uplifting and</v>

40
00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:49.400
meaningful. I feel like, you know,

41
00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:54.200
like the police that wasn't uplifting to some, but it was uplifting to others.

42
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.180
<v 0>Shouldn't only be an always be because ain't sweet all the time, right?</v>

43
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.040
Particularly.

44
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.700
<v 3>In communities of color is not right. And we need to talk about that.</v>

45
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:05.050
We need to report on that.

46
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.700
I've heard someone like in being a rapper as the weather man or weather woman,

47
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.920
um, where you just tell it how it is outside.

48
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.780
I think that we put undue pressure

49
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.500
on rappers to be role models for young people.

50
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.160
We're never really telling these rock stars who were out here doing Coke and

51
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:28.570
like having sex with all these women that they need to be a role model for their

52
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:32.100
community. So why are we always putting this heavy, heavy pressure on rappers?

53
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.840
<v 4>And I said, strongly disagree,</v>

54
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.790
but like really like stuck out to me a lot because I hate when female

55
00:03:38.791 --> 00:03:42.000
artists are like oversexualizing themselves.

56
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.500
And I think my same reaction happened with Nicki Minaj and Cardi B. I was like,

57
00:03:46.501 --> 00:03:48.900
they're doing too much like oversexualizing themselves.

58
00:03:48.901 --> 00:03:53.730
Like I do not like them now, but you know that they're not there to,

59
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.830
you know, be all rainbows and butterflies.

60
00:03:55.831 --> 00:03:59.730
So I think that was just a great point and it really, you know,

61
00:03:59.731 --> 00:04:01.050
shifts my perspective.

62
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.450
<v 1>My thing is when the,</v>

63
00:04:02.451 --> 00:04:07.320
the culture as a whole start shifting and going darker and darker and

64
00:04:07.321 --> 00:04:08.550
darker, and this is what I mean.

65
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.680
Can we all agree that illicit drug use is bad popping pills, heart.

66
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.200
We're not talking about smoking week. What can we all just say? Yeah,

67
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.560
no good big bet. Drugs bad. Right? Well,

68
00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:21.840
you have one of the biggest pop stars. Who's a,

69
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.790
who's a grown man in his mid thirties and a father and the chorus of

70
00:04:26.791 --> 00:04:30.120
his song is him about talking about popping pills. I take a half,

71
00:04:30.121 --> 00:04:32.170
she took the whole thing and we, we, we,

72
00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:35.640
we take that and it just goes over our heads and we're just so numb to it.

73
00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:39.180
We're so desensitized to it. Look, Drake is not my son's role model.

74
00:04:39.181 --> 00:04:43.200
He will never be my son's role model. I, my son's role model, I'm the father,

75
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.550
but let's be honest. There are kids there, a lot of them,

76
00:04:47.551 --> 00:04:51.090
black and Brown kids from poor areas where single parents are prevalent,

77
00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:53.820
single parent homes are prevalent. You think that these, these,

78
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.930
these icons don't have massive influence on them. So you guys are right. Yeah.

79
00:04:57.931 --> 00:04:59.850
I don't expect Drake to be a role model,

80
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.010
but I expect that 34 year old dad to be mindful of who's listening.

81
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.980
<v 4>I have been listening to Eminem and I mean,</v>

82
00:05:07.981 --> 00:05:10.950
old school Eminem who did not give a about anything,

83
00:05:10.951 --> 00:05:15.000
seeing whatever he wanted since I was a baby, as I was born,

84
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.050
I don't know if it was playing in a hospital room as I was coming out as all

85
00:05:19.051 --> 00:05:21.600
I've been listening to. And I'm still who I am today.

86
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.380
And the reason being is because my mom has always allowed me to watch and listen

87
00:05:25.381 --> 00:05:27.900
to these things and has always pulled me to the side and said,

88
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.180
Eminem could rap about killing people and popping pills,

89
00:05:30.181 --> 00:05:32.010
but that's not real life. That's not what you're going to do.

90
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.220
You were really blessed. Your mom is a real one. Yeah, thank God. You know,

91
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.090
my mom at the same time that she told me these things, every once in a while,

92
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.070
my father wasn't around.

93
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.700
So she was in and out of the house working and going to college.

94
00:05:44.701 --> 00:05:48.330
She wasn't really around like that either. Uh, I did get into some,

95
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.200
some things that I wasn't supposed to get into. I had older cousins,

96
00:05:52.201 --> 00:05:55.560
older siblings who were affiliated with gangs, uh,

97
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.100
family members who were drug dealers and stuff like that. Like I may.

98
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.260
<v 1>Have grew up in a decent neighborhood,</v>

99
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.830
but every single person in my family was not in the neighborhood that I was in.

100
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.970
<v 2>Growing up. I had a really incredible single mom,</v>

101
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.580
but my mom didn't censor any music I listened to.

102
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.500
I ended up listening to a lot of Missy Elliot.

103
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.780
A lot of little Kim little Kim is my icon.

104
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.630
So I grew up with a lot of those messages.

105
00:06:16.631 --> 00:06:20.470
And I think sometimes people just boil it down to, Oh my God,

106
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.990
they're influenced the kids to have sex. This is bad.

107
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.580
One of the messages that I got out of listening to little Kim intimacy, Elliot,

108
00:06:27.581 --> 00:06:29.890
that I kept with me as an adult.

109
00:06:29.891 --> 00:06:34.330
And I still keep with me is things that they don't teach them when sex ed

110
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:35.650
or your parents,

111
00:06:35.651 --> 00:06:38.140
probably not going to teach you when they teach you about the birds and the

112
00:06:38.141 --> 00:06:38.501
bees.

113
00:06:38.501 --> 00:06:43.330
Like one thing that I learned from media that I wasn't protected from was that

114
00:06:43.331 --> 00:06:47.290
you have just as much ownership as insects that you are just, Oh,

115
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.620
just as much pleasure. And they're supposed to deliver it to you.

116
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.080
That really kept me from having sex. Cause I was like,

117
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.650
this little rusty boys was coming around, talking about again, you know,

118
00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.150
come to my house after school, you know, what's up. Then I was like,

119
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.190
Oh no. Cause Kim said, Aw.

120
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.100
<v 0>I am happy with the state of our industry today. Brandy disagree,</v>

121
00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:14.410
Joey, I'm going to say somewhat agree. Neelum. I strongly disagree. Pinky.

122
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.810
I somewhat disagree queen. I disagree Russa.

123
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.520
<v 1>Uh, strongly disagree, disagree.</v>

124
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:26.020
<v 0>I teach a hip hop program and an entrepreneurship program to my students.</v>

125
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.190
And I'm still having to tell them, you need to have another hustle, right?

126
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.910
I want people to be able to function within the music industry and make enough

127
00:07:33.911 --> 00:07:38.530
money. I'm not a hundred percent an artist yet. And that's really frustrating.

128
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.630
<v 1>We approached this entire thing as small business owners. And we said, Hey,</v>

129
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:48.010
I know that the first year of the business, the second year, the third year,

130
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.370
listen, I'm just trying to survive. But I mean, Tik TOK right now,

131
00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:55.080
it could happen within a week or two where you can legitimately build an,

132
00:07:55.081 --> 00:07:57.670
a new audience on sick talk that you could transition over.

133
00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.091
<v 2>You know,</v>

134
00:07:58.091 --> 00:08:01.030
you built this whole thing yourself and got to a point where it's like actually

135
00:08:01.031 --> 00:08:01.541
making money,

136
00:08:01.541 --> 00:08:04.240
which nowadays like you have to be huge on Tik TOK or they have to see

137
00:08:04.241 --> 00:08:08.080
opportunity to get, to pull that money out of you right away.

138
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.770
2% of those artists actually recouped,

139
00:08:10.771 --> 00:08:14.980
which means only 2% get to make a second album. Once you get in the machine,

140
00:08:14.981 --> 00:08:18.850
it's like your chances of surviving. It are very slim.

141
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.290
<v 1>I'm biased because I wouldn't have been able to flourish in a different time in</v>

142
00:08:23.291 --> 00:08:27.850
the music industry because my come up was on, um, primarily from YouTube.

143
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.830
<v 2>I live in Boston and I'm from Boston.</v>

144
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.920
If you just Google the press coverage on Boston, hip hop,

145
00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:37.060
you'll primarily see women and you'll primarily see non binary artists.

146
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.050
And that's really something that I hope can be replicated within the bigger

147
00:08:41.051 --> 00:08:45.370
industry. Like I think we're making strides towards that. We also have, um,

148
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.110
supportive foundations.

149
00:08:47.111 --> 00:08:51.850
I received like a five figure grant to completely fund my third album.

150
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.560
And before that I've been a hundred percent self-funded I still have a day job.

151
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.360
Y'all okay. I was at work this morning.

152
00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.260
<v 4>There's a specific kind of men that run this,</v>

153
00:09:00.261 --> 00:09:03.080
that armed black men that are putting out these negative stereotypes.

154
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.520
No offense to anybody.

155
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.180
If we're talking about the negative portrayal of any race and whatnot,

156
00:09:11.181 --> 00:09:13.670
we have to talk about who owns these labels, who's funding,

157
00:09:13.671 --> 00:09:16.760
these labels and funding the industry. And that's what made me say,

158
00:09:16.761 --> 00:09:18.440
I don't really care if I'm in an industry or not,

159
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.540
as long as I'm getting my back to support my family.

160
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.460
<v 2>So that's why I strongly disagree because the music industry to me is</v>

161
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.130
it's a joke. And it's the agenda.

162
00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.600
The song wop is a feminist Anthem strongly. Yeah.

163
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:36.080
<v 4>I feel like I'm going to be shifted, but for now just say disagree.</v>

164
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.830
<v 2>Strongly disagree. I somewhat agree. I agree.</v>

165
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:45.500
<v 4>Strongly disagree with the caveat that I actually have never heard the song</v>

166
00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:47.990
somewhat agree.

167
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.630
<v 2>As a woman. If you're going to reduce me down to a wop,</v>

168
00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:58.040
it's a part of me. But for that to be the Anthem of, Oh,

169
00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:02.240
this is what just brings us liberation as women.

170
00:10:02.241 --> 00:10:03.950
That's a little joke to me.

171
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:09.200
And it also is kind of offensive because you're downplaying

172
00:10:09.201 --> 00:10:13.730
me to a physical thing and I am a being that is just way too much for you

173
00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:14.660
period.

174
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.390
<v 4>Females that made that song. As far as I know.</v>

175
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.850
I don't know if anybody else wrote it cause it's the music history.

176
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.210
<v 2>Well, what's interesting about that is actually there are,</v>

177
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.340
there are male writers in that song,

178
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.330
which is very funny because we call that our liberation, but men are telling us,

179
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.550
I want to gag. I want to choke.

180
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:36.560
<v 4>Is this song the only Anthem for feminism? No,</v>

181
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:37.730
not at all.

182
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:41.930
There are songs that go way beyond and talk about the actual powers that women

183
00:10:41.931 --> 00:10:46.100
have beyond physical appearance and physical parts. Um,

184
00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:51.200
but I know that some women find empowerment in their sexuality

185
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:55.220
and if it brings power to those women that listen to it,

186
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:57.080
then it's supporting feminism.

187
00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.740
<v 2>I definitely a hundred percent agree with that. Like I love law.</v>

188
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:04.910
I did a remix to walk. I let us on. I don't care. But, um,

189
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:09.500
I don't the only person that said strongly agree because it is about ownership

190
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.350
of body and ownership of sexuality.

191
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.290
Sometimes I feel like when you are a rapper that does that,

192
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:19.040
either people assume that it was put onto you by men, which it wasn't,

193
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.330
or they assume that you can't do anything else or you're not as smart or you're

194
00:11:23.331 --> 00:11:26.300
not as good. And for me personally,

195
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:30.500
sex being such a predominant theme of my music is very personal for me.

196
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:34.190
For two reasons. One being a plus sized, black women,

197
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:38.330
not only representation I've seen in myself and media is the sassy,

198
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.690
a sexual best friend. That's never the love interest.

199
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:45.680
That's never viewed in a sexual way. My music and watch it's.

200
00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.670
It's just kind of like me exploring my sexuality and having that ownership.

201
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.440
I'm also a rape survivor.

202
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:56.380
And one way that I to cope with that was ownership of my sexuality and

203
00:11:56.381 --> 00:11:59.170
ownership of my body because I was taken away from me.

204
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:03.850
And obviously that's not the way that a lot of people are going to cope,

205
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.510
but for me, that was how I coped. And I got through that trauma.

206
00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:12.460
That's as intense as getting those things ripped away from you is that it's mine

207
00:12:12.461 --> 00:12:13.294
now.

208
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.290
And I have a hundred percent ownership of it and how I choose to display it is a

209
00:12:17.291 --> 00:12:19.120
hundred percent on me.

210
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.510
And I feel a lot of power and a lot of liberation from that.

211
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.980
And I think it's okay if you don't,

212
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.530
but I don't think you should just count women not to.

213
00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:30.660
<v 3>And facts on facts on facts. Um,</v>

214
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.690
I just wanted to say so I somewhat agreed. Um,

215
00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:38.370
because there are other songs that I would say are probably better feminist

216
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.450
anthems, right? But when we think about what feminism is, period,

217
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.210
it's just believing the equality of both genders, right?

218
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:49.260
So if we can have dudes talking about their and seeing,

219
00:12:49.261 --> 00:12:51.270
and sucking and all of this stuff,

220
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:56.550
then like people were really upset and men were really upset at

221
00:12:56.551 --> 00:12:59.790
why they went honey. They were mad, mad, mad, mad, mad.

222
00:12:59.791 --> 00:13:04.560
Why can't I show my young girls that owning their sexuality is powerful then.

223
00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:08.820
Right? Like I wish someone told me that. And um,

224
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:10.500
I Brandi,

225
00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:14.070
thank you so much for sharing that because I share the same experience. Um,

226
00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:18.840
why can't we have someone

227
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:22.020
telling us that so that we know to own it before someone else is taking that

228
00:13:22.021 --> 00:13:22.830
from us?

229
00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:27.810
<v 2>For me, the wop song is, is another. I also covered it for me.</v>

230
00:13:27.811 --> 00:13:29.760
It was like a huge liberating moment.

231
00:13:29.761 --> 00:13:33.150
And this is coming from an artist that has a song called BDE,

232
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.860
which stands for big Dick energy.

233
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:39.600
Because this whole time I've been trying to liberate myself sexually and like be

234
00:13:39.601 --> 00:13:43.470
comfortable with who I am and what my desires are. As a woman,

235
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:46.860
I thought I needed to put on a fake Dick, you know,

236
00:13:46.861 --> 00:13:49.740
and write a song about like that. My energy has a big dig.

237
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:53.730
It was just so liberating for me to hear women. And by the way,

238
00:13:53.731 --> 00:13:57.060
shout out to mega stallion who is a prolific freestyler.

239
00:13:57.061 --> 00:14:01.080
I'm pretty sure she probably wrote her bars. I just wanted to add that my,

240
00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:04.290
my little lens of perspective from a little Nebraska.

241
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:06.840
<v 4>For the first time, it feels like in a long time, it's,</v>

242
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.620
she's talking about what she wants to do and what she likes instead of talking

243
00:14:10.621 --> 00:14:14.220
about what a man likes into what a man wants and stuff like that.

244
00:14:14.221 --> 00:14:16.330
And that's why I feel like the power comes from.

245
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.470
<v 2>I also think that men were upset because of the sample.</v>

246
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:23.730
So the original song that has, there's some holes in that house. That's great.

247
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:27.660
It's a classic. Everybody knows it, but a woman took it and flipped it.

248
00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:31.710
And now it's not about degregation anymore. It's about liberation.

249
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:32.820
Then now it's a problem.

250
00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:37.770
<v 4>As expected. This conversation did really shift my view on the wipe.</v>

251
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.000
I've only heard it once because once was enough for me because it didn't make me

252
00:14:42.001 --> 00:14:43.890
mad, but it was just too much.

253
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:48.690
Like it's literally the closest thing I've ever heard. The audio pornography,

254
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.260
you know, I was bounced into it and everything like everybody's flow.

255
00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.490
Like I could appreciate.

256
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:53.323
<v 1>The artistic nature.</v>

257
00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.230
<v 2>You must not have heard a lot of men rep because that's.</v>

258
00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:58.143
<v 3>What do you see?</v>

259
00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:04.000
<v 1>Yeah, no, I guess maybe because it's the shock value and I'm wondering,</v>

260
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:06.550
what do you think the intent was behind the song?

261
00:15:06.551 --> 00:15:10.540
Do you think it was to like empower women or do you think it was to shock people

262
00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.300
and get views and clicks? Just from the shock factor?

263
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.390
<v 2>A lot worse comes from men. So I was like,</v>

264
00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.150
y'all are y'all are scandalized by this

265
00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.460
I a hundred percent agree with you brand new. It was like, Oh my God.

266
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:27.160
It was like, first of all, too, it's consistent with what car do you do?

267
00:15:27.161 --> 00:15:31.330
Why are you guys so like, Oh my God, like you haven't heard her. That's crazy.

268
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.380
Cardi was being Carney.

269
00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:36.610
<v 1>Is this notion that men were upset. Like I wasn't upset. I saw the promo for it.</v>

270
00:15:36.611 --> 00:15:39.070
And I was just kinda like, I've seen this story before.

271
00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:43.990
This is little cam pass for me in this being an Anthem for feminism.

272
00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.290
Uh, what, uh,

273
00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:51.160
what other modern songs are better representation or what are modern feminist

274
00:15:51.161 --> 00:15:52.540
anthems that don't degrade?

275
00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:55.270
<v 3>I believe it was rolling stone,</v>

276
00:15:55.271 --> 00:16:00.130
like declared Rhapsody's last album Eve as like, uh, the,

277
00:16:00.131 --> 00:16:03.880
a masterpiece in hip hop feminism or something like that. The fact that,

278
00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:04.300
you know,

279
00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.180
some people don't know that about her or don't know that about her album or

280
00:16:07.181 --> 00:16:11.680
having listened to her album means that as women we're losing the fact that wop

281
00:16:11.681 --> 00:16:15.280
comes out and now we're celebrating our sexuality and men are up in arms and

282
00:16:15.281 --> 00:16:19.630
upset about it, but don't check their own when it comes to that. We're losing.

283
00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:24.700
As long as we continue to function within a patriarchal society and a genre of

284
00:16:24.701 --> 00:16:28.210
music that is inherently misogynistic, we're losing,

285
00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.930
I have felt discriminated against in my industry.

286
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:35.560
I strongly agree. Somewhat agree. I agree.

287
00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.940
Strongly agree, somewhat agree, somewhat agree.

288
00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.313
I agree.

289
00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.790
<v 2>So I've had a lot of doors shut just based on the way that I look,</v>

290
00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:50.380
no one even cared. If I could rap, it was automatically,

291
00:16:50.381 --> 00:16:53.140
you're a woman. And then if people could get over that,

292
00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:58.150
they couldn't get over my size and being a plus size woman that wraps a

293
00:16:58.151 --> 00:17:02.350
lot about a lot of sexual things. I got a lot of notes just based on that.

294
00:17:02.351 --> 00:17:05.530
Like no one wants to hear that from a woman that looks like you.

295
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:08.470
So not necessarily that they don't want to hear it from a woman at all.

296
00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:10.630
It was very much a woman that looks like you.

297
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:14.380
But I also get a lot of love from people that are like, you look like me,

298
00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:15.400
you look like my family.

299
00:17:15.401 --> 00:17:20.200
You look like my friends and we all want to do the whole, Popolo some song.

300
00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.400
So we want to hear it.

301
00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.460
<v 3>I'm just living for you. I just love you so much.</v>

302
00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:27.400
<v 2>We know.</v>

303
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.940
<v 3>That representation matters, right? We see it all the time. And yet,</v>

304
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:35.860
for some reason, when it comes to bigger women, it's just, no,

305
00:17:35.861 --> 00:17:37.600
but not that kind of representation,

306
00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:40.060
but there are women out there that want to hear that,

307
00:17:40.061 --> 00:17:43.750
that want to feel empowered in their bodies and their sexuality.

308
00:17:43.751 --> 00:17:46.300
So my friends are rapper rappers, right?

309
00:17:46.301 --> 00:17:49.830
And so they are constantly like pink.

310
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.080
I don't understand what the problem is. And I'm like,

311
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:56.250
it's because I have a vagina. That's really all it is.

312
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:58.850
<v 1>Gender. I think in like hip hop,</v>

313
00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.880
especially is the most common description.

314
00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:07.640
<v 2>There's a prototype of a female rapper. And if you don't fit it naturally,</v>

315
00:18:07.641 --> 00:18:09.140
you're getting discriminated against.

316
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:12.020
I'm kind of like a full pot in this industry. Cause it's like,

317
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:17.030
not only are you not hypersexualized, you're fricking Muslim. So it's like,

318
00:18:17.031 --> 00:18:20.540
dude, you don't even fit in this category. You know what I'm saying?

319
00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:21.141
Back in the day,

320
00:18:21.141 --> 00:18:25.490
I used to be able to listen to little Kim and Lauren Hill on the radio, both,

321
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.820
you know? And I just feel like there's just a need of balance.

322
00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:33.320
<v 3>Yeah. And even when you do have your Cardi and you have someone like a Rhapsody,</v>

323
00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:37.010
why isn't she getting as much funding or as much airtime and as much play

324
00:18:37.011 --> 00:18:41.600
because she is the opposite. She is something that we need and want. So,

325
00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:45.140
um, I teach, uh, hip hop, mostly young women.

326
00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:47.390
And a lot of them didn't even know who she was.

327
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.560
Didn't know a lot of these sort of underground women MCs that are doing really

328
00:18:51.561 --> 00:18:54.350
dope stuff. And it's like, why aren't we putting money towards that?

329
00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:57.710
<v 1>I have to still put myself in agree because of the content that I choose to rap</v>

330
00:18:57.711 --> 00:19:00.410
about. I rap about real things that are going on in the world.

331
00:19:00.411 --> 00:19:04.370
I rap about how there they're more than 75,000 black women missing in the world

332
00:19:04.371 --> 00:19:08.300
ever have about the thing that's going on in China,

333
00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:10.700
Israel and Palestine. I write about all of that stuff.

334
00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:15.260
So a lot of people are afraid to get on tracks with me because they think that I

335
00:19:15.261 --> 00:19:19.220
might get blackballed in that might get them black bolt. So it's by choice.

336
00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.270
I love this discrimination.

337
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.600
<v 2>Wow. I'm so happy that I'm a part of this conversation.</v>

338
00:19:23.601 --> 00:19:27.590
You guys already pointed out so many lenses that I don't even see.

339
00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.670
And I think definitely as a white woman making black music,

340
00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:33.410
I think it's important to acknowledge that.

341
00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:37.970
<v 3>Do you feel like you've been discriminated against for being a white woman in</v>

342
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.690
rep?

343
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:42.860
<v 2>The first deal that I signed was with LA Reid and one of the first things he</v>

344
00:19:42.861 --> 00:19:46.910
said after the ink was dry, was like, we're not going to rap. Like you are,

345
00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.910
you're gonna fit into this like Katy Perry box much better.

346
00:19:49.911 --> 00:19:53.060
Like if you want to get the bag, this is what you do. And you know,

347
00:19:53.061 --> 00:19:56.870
when LA Reed tells you that, that's what you, you listen for the longest time,

348
00:19:56.871 --> 00:20:01.190
I had to sort of unpack what that meant and what my lesson was leading me to.

349
00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:02.570
And I had to be honest,

350
00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:07.580
a lot of work to do in terms of learning the art form of

351
00:20:07.581 --> 00:20:07.910
rap.

352
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:08.743
<v 1>Just personally,</v>

353
00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:13.640
a motto that I do my best to live by is I go where I'm celebrated and not

354
00:20:13.641 --> 00:20:17.570
just tolerated. Like I'm an, I'm an immigrant refugee.

355
00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:21.440
English is not my first language, but I'm viewed white by society.

356
00:20:21.441 --> 00:20:24.200
So I have a degree of white privilege. I'm a white guy in hip hop.

357
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:26.540
Who's an independent artist, who's a Christian.

358
00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.880
So it's just like all those different things.

359
00:20:28.881 --> 00:20:33.770
There's a degree of discrimination that I faced because of all

360
00:20:33.771 --> 00:20:35.630
that. But I would say it,

361
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:40.400
the privilege that I've had of being viewed as a white male in society has far

362
00:20:40.401 --> 00:20:44.930
outweighed the, any consequences or any negative sides of,

363
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:48.040
you know, being the minority in a black art form.

364
00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:50.050
<v 4>Music can lead to real life.</v>

365
00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:54.630
<v 2>Violence against women disagree. I agree. I agree.</v>

366
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:57.420
Strongly agree. Somewhat disagree.

367
00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.280
<v 4>I agree. Somewhat agree.</v>

368
00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:05.070
<v 2>If I'm saying everyday hope, slip, trip, hope slip trick.</v>

369
00:21:05.071 --> 00:21:09.600
And I'm listening to that over and over again as a woman to

370
00:21:09.601 --> 00:21:13.590
constantly hear that. And as a man or a young boy to constantly hear,

371
00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:18.240
that's how you talk to talk about a woman and then your perception that you have

372
00:21:18.241 --> 00:21:21.630
on women and you see a girl and you're like, Oh,

373
00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.420
it's only because I hear that over and over again. She's, she's a whole,

374
00:21:24.421 --> 00:21:26.160
she's a. You know what I'm saying?

375
00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:30.870
And then even changes how I treat her now I treat her like, she just nothing,

376
00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.240
you know what I'm saying? Cause I constantly had that in my ear.

377
00:21:33.241 --> 00:21:36.390
I just think it would be foolish to think that incantations and grill and that

378
00:21:36.391 --> 00:21:39.390
those songs have that type of power. When we think about violence,

379
00:21:39.391 --> 00:21:43.590
like it doesn't have to mean physical violence all the time.

380
00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:48.810
Right. Um, I feel personally traumatized sometimes when I hear some,

381
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:51.060
some music or certain things that are said,

382
00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:55.170
I think it was Rick Ross that had like a line that was about like, you know,

383
00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:58.350
raping a woman or, you know what I mean? That traumatized me.

384
00:21:58.351 --> 00:21:59.670
So when we think about violence,

385
00:21:59.671 --> 00:22:02.700
like we have to understand that it's not just actual physical harm that's

386
00:22:02.701 --> 00:22:04.530
happening. It could be mental, emotional.

387
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:08.610
She made me like kind of think of kind of like that spiritual or like emotional

388
00:22:08.611 --> 00:22:09.960
violence, which I really didn't think of.

389
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.970
So I'm not going to say change with disagree.

390
00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:15.090
I'm going to say somewhat disagree because I still do. Um,

391
00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.950
just that violence against women mindless in general is the

392
00:22:19.951 --> 00:22:20.910
beginning of time.

393
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.720
A lot of the biggest influences are right in our neighborhoods right on our

394
00:22:24.721 --> 00:22:29.460
block. You know what I mean? Like if I know my father got killed on a block,

395
00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:30.121
then yeah.

396
00:22:30.121 --> 00:22:33.540
I'm much more likely to have a gun and much more likely to probably go kill

397
00:22:33.541 --> 00:22:36.540
somebody else. I don't think that has anything to do with gangsters.

398
00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:41.040
I agree with you. I feel like it, you can't blame violence on music,

399
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:45.720
but I like I'm like in South central and stuff like that, I just know like,

400
00:22:45.721 --> 00:22:50.370
as far as the suggestion is a suggestion just in the

401
00:22:50.371 --> 00:22:51.180
psyche.

402
00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.580
<v 4>A lot of this stuff is theme music.</v>

403
00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:57.960
I've been on rides where people were saying really snitching on myself.

404
00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:01.260
I've been on rides where people were like have evil intent and whatnot.

405
00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:06.330
And they were on their way to go do some evil stuff. And what were they playing?

406
00:23:06.331 --> 00:23:10.560
What were the theme songs? You, you guessed it some gangster rep.

407
00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:15.180
So can it influence and encourage? Yes,

408
00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:20.040
but it's not the blame. Um, I listened to shoot them up,

409
00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:22.500
rap music. Whenever I listened to that,

410
00:23:22.501 --> 00:23:27.330
while I'm cleaning the dishes in my suburban home and it

411
00:23:27.331 --> 00:23:28.710
doesn't make me say, you know what,

412
00:23:28.711 --> 00:23:31.230
let me stop doing these dishes and go run outside and kill somebody.

413
00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:31.950
<v 2>Great.</v>

414
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:35.820
I just want to say I'm grateful for all these perspectives because I chose

415
00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:39.000
somewhat disagree because I don't want it to be true.

416
00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.840
I don't want to think that music can influence violence in that way.

417
00:23:42.841 --> 00:23:46.190
So I just am grateful because I am how.

418
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.970
<v 1>My brain actually processes that I'm thinking about the next generation.</v>

419
00:23:49.971 --> 00:23:51.230
I'm thinking about my nieces.

420
00:23:51.231 --> 00:23:54.290
I'm thinking about my nephews that aren't there yet where they don't understand.

421
00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:54.621
Yeah.

422
00:23:54.621 --> 00:23:58.580
I consume this song for escapism and I consume this song to be in touch with my

423
00:23:58.581 --> 00:24:01.190
inner freak. I think there's a balance there,

424
00:24:01.191 --> 00:24:04.430
but I definitely think that if you're not in the right frame of mind,

425
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:09.200
you can definitely be triggered to go do some wild stuff by a song or the song

426
00:24:09.201 --> 00:24:11.330
is just playing. And if you're mentally weak,

427
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:14.450
then you're going to be influenced your eat.

428
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.930
You're more prone to be influenced by music to do, you know,

429
00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.460
carry out violence and stuff like that.

430
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:22.640
But also remember drive-bys did definitely happen in the seventies when

431
00:24:22.641 --> 00:24:25.850
everybody was listening to funk music. So anything can happen to anything.

432
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:27.980
I'm going to be thinking about a lot of things.

433
00:24:27.981 --> 00:24:29.480
I feel like I'm just going to be looking at a wall,

434
00:24:29.481 --> 00:24:32.750
thinking about life for the next three hours after this whole conversation.

435
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.650
And you guys were all really fun to talk to and listen to.

436
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.980
<v 2>You can learn something from everyone.</v>

437
00:24:38.981 --> 00:24:43.510
And I really loved it and I wish the industry can be as diverse as

438
00:24:43.511 --> 00:24:48.040
this all y'all span. Now that's just, it. That's all I have to say. Period dot.

439
00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:53.170
<v 3>Let's give women MCs their flowers now, please.</v>

440
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:54.850
Right. Let's support them.

441
00:24:54.851 --> 00:24:58.150
Let's uplift them because how are we going to get to the next phase?

442
00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:01.330
Unless like we all said, we are the ones that we have to support.

443
00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:05.530
Like the more we're going to start seeing this resurgence of other young women

444
00:25:05.531 --> 00:25:08.300
who come up and are able to do it because we are paving the way for.

445
00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:11.210
<v 2>Hey guys, thanks so much for checking out this episode.</v>

446
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:15.760
<v 3>The music we consume directly influences how we participate in a culture that</v>

447
00:25:15.761 --> 00:25:18.100
accepts the oppression and violence against women and girls.

448
00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.690
<v 2>Spotlight initiative and the social good club have teamed up on a mission to</v>

449
00:25:22.691 --> 00:25:26.230

450
00:25:26.231 --> 00:25:28.420
to help shape a culture without male dominance,

451
00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.020
to create safe spaces for everyone to live in peace and thrive.

452
00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:34.540
