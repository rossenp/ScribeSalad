00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.920

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.430

I know what you're thinking.

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.260
Electric braces are annoying because the blades get dull. But guess what?

7
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.700
Manscape also has a replenishment tack, boom,

8

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.470
And we hope you enjoy this episode on man.

18
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.880
<v 1>We brought together seven sorority girls.</v>

19
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.380
<v 2>I'm in a sorority sorority, I'm in a sorority and I'm in a sorority.</v>

20
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.600
<v 1>Except everyone is a liar. Like really all of them, they're all lying.</v>

21
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.820
This is odd man out.

22
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.900
<v 0>So my game plan going in is to give a buddy buddy with one of the girls as quick</v>

23
00:01:29.901 --> 00:01:32.840
as possible. You're like, yes, girl, I'm on your side.

24
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.470
Don't even worry about it. It's important that I like to get the specifics,

25
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:40.460
right? Because if I can get details early, then they're going to trust me.

26
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.250
I plan on kind of diverting the girl's attention.

27
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.850
Maybe talk more about girly things instead of just green.

28
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.000
<v 2>But also if I start getting heat or anything like that,</v>

29
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.420
I'm gonna just start pulling everything out of my back pocket because I'm not

30
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.020
going to.

31
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.600
<v 0>The name that I chose was Marsha. It's close to Martin.</v>

32
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.430
<v 2>Rachel is a character that I created now.</v>

33
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.220
I think that the sorority for all the information about her chapter,

34
00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:04.070
her sorority philanthropy's state functions, but day.

35
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.310
<v 0>Uh, I worked on a bunch of notes. You've got everything in here. Uh,</v>

36
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.550
I also did some research about just girls in general, in case, you know,

37
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.820
they try to ask me any questions about girls.

38
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.100
<v 2>I think a lot of research actually, but that's because like,</v>

39
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.720
this is the first time it's going to be in the bowl.

40
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.270
So of course I'm going to be like, Oh my God, what's going on?

41
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.290
<v 0>I'm going to have to type like a girl. I'll use the all lower case.</v>

42
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.391
<v 2>All lower case.</v>

43
00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:30.470
Now I'm going to try and go a little over the top with messages as far as like

44
00:02:30.471 --> 00:02:33.380
how I'm reacting. I know this is my second time to be up and out,

45
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.260
but I am sweating. It's not good.

46
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.940
Just got to not say anything stupid. All right, let's do this.

47
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.900
All right. Round one. Let's go. Let's start with,

48
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.110
I want to do multiple eyes on hi.

49
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.570
I'm not going to be the first one to ask a question.

50
00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:54.140
There's no way that's happening. They'll pick up and I'll just go ahead.

51
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.730
<v 0>So I'm going to ask where everyone is from. I'm not weak mentally.</v>

52
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.270
Ah, where's everyone from.

53
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.540
<v 2>I'm in San Jose.</v>

54
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.800
I'm from Missouri state LA,

55
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.350
but go to school at UCS B.

56
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.430
I'm going to capitalize while knocking use proper punctuation. Sona for school.

57
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.540
Oh my gosh, Arizona. That's where Nicole's from.

58
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.630
<v 0>Nobody's talking. Anything that matters right now,</v>

59
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.400
more takes less testing.

60
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.140
<v 2>I am a man. I think they're already answering that. Okay.</v>

61
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.930
What sorority is everyone in? Yeah. Obvious question.

62
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.700
<v 3>Okay. So the first role is you don't ask what sorority you're in. I don't know.</v>

63
00:03:38.701 --> 00:03:41.700
That's just a sorority girl thing, especially when I go out.

64
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.020
So that's kind of a red flag. I think I would vote for Katie, but we'll see.

65
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.370
Catholic gamma, Delta.

66
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.670
<v 0>Hi, all red hot. That's something that like,</v>

67
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.130
that's like a term that most high was used.

68
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.660
<v 2>Okay. So I'm an AOP, but you got to do the double eyes, but catcher,</v>

69
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.040
if you ride out PI, they will catch them on with PI beta Phi. Here.

70
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.240
<v 0>He move. If I move nice. Ooh,</v>

71
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.860
there's an ADPi. Thank God. I was, I always chose ADPi as my fake sorority,

72
00:04:10.861 --> 00:04:14.460
but thank God I didn't because Nicole would have just ripped me a new one.

73
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.790
Looks last Epsilon, new.

74
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.560
<v 2>Loser class. Are you in like chapter? Okay.</v>

75
00:04:22.561 --> 00:04:25.740
So I'm in the gamma XY chapter Epsilon,

76
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.140
new alpha PSI chapter.

77
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.210
<v 0>Okay. Okay. What?</v>

78
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.240
<v 2>This is so interesting. What?</v>

79
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.360
<v 0>Good. I feel like an opera now. Like I feel like they can,</v>

80
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:40.583
they're going to stick me. Yeah.

81
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.820
<v 3>How's your chapter found it?</v>

82
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.150
I feel like this should be a pretty common question.

83
00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:48.510
Everyone should know this in an org that you're in. So for instance,

84
00:04:48.511 --> 00:04:49.950
five year is.

85
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.360
<v 2>1852.</v>

86
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.960
<v 0>It's really all out on, I don't know the number. Exactly.</v>

87
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:00.443
Uh.

88
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.600
<v 2>Okay. So she means like the chapter.</v>

89
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.900
<v 0>Say some random random one 1895.</v>

90
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.040
That seems okay. Here. Okay. This is,

91
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.110
I think like 1895. Isn't too far off from the numbers that they hit.

92
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.120
1892, 1851.

93
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.500
<v 2>Well, I can't spell. We have six founders overall.</v>

94
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.610
<v 0>Was girls, girls, girls,</v>

95
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.880
not answering my question. I freaked up, uh, out of this world.

96
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.730
What was my theme? What was my bid date? Theme? And they're like raced home.

97
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.830
This girl wants to go into the founders.

98
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.160
I hope we can just skip past that. Just move it to the side. Cause uh,

99
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.600
I'm just going to give a random, yeah.

100
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.050
<v 2>It was breaking records.</v>

101
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.730
<v 0>I love what I did today. Okay.</v>

102
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.770
Trying to try to not be a mole here. Like.

103
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.021
<v 3>Well,</v>

104
00:06:01.021 --> 00:06:03.790
I didn't want to leave out the founder's question just cause I didn't want to

105
00:06:03.791 --> 00:06:07.990
get anyone suspicious. So I brought it back in and I said that, uh, Mary, Mary,

106
00:06:07.991 --> 00:06:11.920
Martha are the three founders of finding a sorority, which is very true.

107
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.650
It's on their, uh, buying you website.

108
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.110
<v 0>Oh God. I made something up.</v>

109
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.210
Hopefully they hopefully they didn't notice or see right through me.

110
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.740
What's everyone's philanthropy. Oh bet. Baby bed.

111
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.780
<v 2>Oh, what does our philanthropy Ronald make dog food.</v>

112
00:06:31.781 --> 00:06:35.320
I give myself away on that one. Um.

113
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.820
<v 0>Oh wait. Okay. She named him. She named him,</v>

114
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.990
I think called me like three people said they're they're founders today.

115
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.760
Three Mary, Mary and Martha hundreds fricking killing this dude.

116
00:06:48.761 --> 00:06:52.600
No one's going to suspect me. And if they do screw that stupid.

117
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.880
<v 2>When people started talking about philanthropy,</v>

118
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.720
all the other sorority girls were able to just, you know, type freely.

119
00:06:58.721 --> 00:07:01.690
Whereas I was like having to think about it a little bit and it delayed my

120
00:07:01.691 --> 00:07:02.380
answers.

121
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.760
<v 0>I think my downfall was the founder's question. I think I survived that round.</v>

122
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.100
Um, there were other girls who didn't talk that much.

123
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.140
<v 3>I threw in some messages here and there.</v>

124
00:07:11.141 --> 00:07:13.590
I didn't want to take control of the chat too much.

125
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.930
<v 2>I really had nobody to vote where like nobody said anything such,</v>

126
00:07:16.931 --> 00:07:19.390
but I think I'm going to go with Nikita. Sorry girl.

127
00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.390
I just don't want to be the first one to like be voted out. To be honest,

128
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.070
I think I'm going to vote for.

129
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.110
<v 0>Nicole. Definitely.</v>

130
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.850
There's a lot of questions and I gotta be the person to ask questions that way.

131
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.580
I don't think it's me. Stephanie. She's an OB. I was so specific.

132
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.040
She gave them ammunition for them to go on to you.

133
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.320
<v 3>I think I'm going to have to vote for Kate.</v>

134
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.560
She might be the person to vote me out in that later rounds.

135
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.380
And I kind of just want to get the strongest personality.

136
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:49.210
<v 0>Nicole seems a little stressed to me just cause like Ronald McDonald house</v>

137
00:07:49.211 --> 00:07:53.890
charities come on. And she said, I loved bid day. You want to be the mall?

138
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:58.150
I think I'm going to put Nikita. She didn't talk like a girl.

139
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.510
I guess I swear I did all this work. Get kicked out of me.

140
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.513
I'll be upset.

141
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:08.440
The three way tie Nicole Nikita and Stephanie,

142
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.900
you guys are going to have 30 seconds now to type out a paragraph which States

143
00:08:13.901 --> 00:08:18.310
your case. You do not deserve to be voted out right now.

144
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:26.290
<v 2>This is not good at all. This is not good. I am scared. I am.</v>

145
00:08:26.291 --> 00:08:29.980
So I love my sorority. I'm like, gosh,

146
00:08:29.981 --> 00:08:33.550
I can't type when else I can't hold on. Not okay. I'm not,

147
00:08:33.551 --> 00:08:35.590
there's no way I'm not getting out right now.

148
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:40.240
<v 0>I think I should be kicked out.</v>

149
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.840
So I screwed up. I screwed up so bad.

150
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.950
I said, I said, I'm a girl. Why did I say that? Honestly, I'm a girl.

151
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:52.090
All right.

152
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:56.670
So everyone other than them now gets a chance to read

153
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:57.983
vote.

154
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.690
<v 2>Let's wait. I know they're all telling the truth, but if I had to pick one,</v>

155
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.450
I thought was lying. Probably pick Nicole.

156
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.450
<v 0>I'm still gonna vote for Stephanie. I was gonna be my downfall.</v>

157
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.900
She stays in this competition. So Kate, when you watch this,

158
00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:13.640
I think you're the strongest person in this chat.

159
00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:18.890
And Stephanie has a garbage, garbage case. Also.

160
00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:23.510
I'm a girl. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Stephanie. You're probably really good person.

161
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.330
It was just really bad. All right.

162
00:09:26.331 --> 00:09:30.740
So the first person voted out is going to be stuffing.

163
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.673
<v 2>Hi Stephanie.</v>

164
00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.730
<v 0>Everyone was, everyone was talking about why they joined the sorority.</v>

165
00:09:37.731 --> 00:09:40.760
I should have done that instead. I'm just talking about like, Oh,

166
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:45.170
I did everything correctly. And then to top it off, I say, and I'm a girl. Yeah.

167
00:09:45.171 --> 00:09:48.980
I messed up big time. I folded under pressure. I cracked like a,

168
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.360
like a fragile, fragile, uh,

169
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.070
last, I don't know I was supposed to return home to my sorority after this.

170
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:04.190
<v 2>Okay. So I know I answered it to fit. Uh, why didn't you rush to your sorority?</v>

171
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.960
I got to think why. Um, okay,

172
00:10:11.961 --> 00:10:15.830
so they're asking why they just wrote in, um,

173
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:20.360
I joined because I was on,

174
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:22.520
um,

175
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:27.230
my cheer team in high school and I

176
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.820
really wanted a sense of community and

177
00:10:31.821 --> 00:10:36.230
support on such a large campus.

178
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:41.990
All right. So I'm going to drop a legacy car. How long do you want to send?

179
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.340
I got, so I'm going to say that.

180
00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.990
<v 0>Started talking like, all right, saying that rushed. Cause you know,</v>

181
00:10:47.991 --> 00:10:52.730
I love the girls made a huge connection with everybody and let's say,

182
00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.880
let's say I have reading problems when I was little.

183
00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:01.370
<v 2>What are some of your favorite TG themes?</v>

184
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:10.220
Let's just skip over that. So a TG is a theme gathering.

185
00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:14.120
It's like when a fraternity pairs up with a sorority for a night and they like

186
00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:15.350
have an event together.

187
00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.300
<v 0>You're coming in late. You're too late.</v>

188
00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:25.340
<v 2>He's sniffing you out. Um, I wanna keep the contract ramping.</v>

189
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:27.430
Y'all do lie.

190
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:32.350
<v 0>All right. Big question. Can you all answer at once is one of my one,</v>

191
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:36.290
my sorority friends told me they only wear white to initiation.

192
00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.200
<v 2>I mean, I could keep talking about our philanthropy, but okay.</v>

193
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:42.560
Kate said big question. Can you all answer at once?

194
00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:49.070
Okay. Thank you, Marcia. Um,

195
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.860
what color did you wear to initiation?

196
00:11:53.861 --> 00:11:57.650
I don't know if she's talking about initiation or like just getting like pinned

197
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.930
in because they're two different things. And one of them is very secret,

198
00:12:01.931 --> 00:12:02.800
which I have no clue.

199
00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:04.140
<v 4>The first you said white.</v>

200
00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.260
And then I was thinking that the rest of them were going to say white and that

201
00:12:07.261 --> 00:12:10.110
was going to be the thing that they do across all sororities.

202
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:11.580
And then this girl said burden.

203
00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:13.620
They're going to sniff the bus with both of us out.

204
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.700
<v 2>Kay said every sorority here, whereas white, um.</v>

205
00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:22.080
<v 0>I'm throwing all the suspect on Marsha and Nikita right now.</v>

206
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:28.310
<v 2>Okay. I'm not going to ask that big little reveal coming to clear so far. Oh.</v>

207
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:33.450
<v 0>Nikita Nikita says, Oh, we didn't have ours yet because of Corona.</v>

208
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.220
But she said burgundy.

209
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.210
<v 2>Everything already here wears white.</v>

210
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.600
<v 4>I saw some sororities on campus. Had designer brands.</v>

211
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.200
<v 0>The reveal thing. Oh no, I got no notes on that one.</v>

212
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:53.790
<v 4>They had designer brand big a little bit.</v>

213
00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.600
<v 2>Okay. We have like one minute. Um, and nobody's really typing.</v>

214
00:12:57.601 --> 00:13:01.260
They asked big little reveal theme and I simply don't know the answer to that.

215
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.080
I don't even know what a big little reveal thing would be. Okay.

216
00:13:04.081 --> 00:13:05.850
I'm just going to skip that question really quickly. Okay.

217
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.790
<v 0>I think I'm good. I honestly think I'm doing really good right now.</v>

218
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.390
<v 4>Barbie. All right. I'm going to upperclassmen.</v>

219
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.190
I had my big little reveal.

220
00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:19.140
<v 0>It just like I was cheating because I talked to my sorority friends like, Oh.</v>

221
00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.500
<v 2>I said, where are using zoom? I totally missed type that.</v>

222
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:26.040
Every story girl wears the white to their initiation. That's the thing.

223
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.990
How am I supposed to know that? I don't even have initiation.

224
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.170
<v 0>I gonna go after Mikita just cause she,</v>

225
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:34.020
she said the color of her initiation and then she's like, Oh wait,

226
00:13:34.021 --> 00:13:35.070
we didn't have initiation.

227
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:39.120
<v 2>I'm going to vote for Nikita. Just because she said burgundy.</v>

228
00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:42.900
<v 4>For McKayla. Kate is Kate is speaking a lot.</v>

229
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:45.630
She's being very specific nitpicky.

230
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.780
I don't like that because then they're going to sniff me out and she's going to

231
00:13:48.781 --> 00:13:52.260
be asking the wrong questions. Unfortunately, Kate, you must be terminated.

232
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:56.190
<v 2>I'm gonna be voting for Marsha because she was the only one that was said blue.</v>

233
00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:57.240
But I said Bernie. And he said,

234
00:13:57.241 --> 00:13:59.190
it's probably going to be a tie between me and her.

235
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.960
Caitlin's really coming for our next though.

236
00:14:00.961 --> 00:14:03.060
She said every sorority here wears white.

237
00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:07.590
And I don't know if that's like a question or she was just really saying like,

238
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:11.400
you guys wore blue and burgundy, like liars. There's been another time.

239
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:14.820
It's between Nikita and Kate. Why am I going to be doing.

240
00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:19.260
<v 0>That's not good. What did I do? No please. No,</v>

241
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:24.840
no, no. I thought I was doing so good.

242
00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:27.840
Did I Alrighty up? Thank you guys.

243
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.260
Just because I feel like it keeps going. I get the boot.

244
00:14:31.261 --> 00:14:32.820
I'm going to vote for Kate out now.

245
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.810
<v 4>Why not? Yeah. I'm still gonna to. Okay.</v>

246
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:39.520
<v 2>All right. So I'm going to actually be voting for Kate this time. Our next.</v>

247
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:43.140
<v 0>Person eliminated is Katie.</v>

248
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.430
Like basically I'm going to ask the questions you had hard times.

249
00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:51.980
I promise you're laid low. The second round and then was sealed.

250
00:14:51.981 --> 00:14:55.720
My fate is I couldn't type or think of anything for the life of me. I got,

251
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:56.563
I just got merged.

252
00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:01.630
<v 2>All right. We got three minutes. Um, I have a you,</v>

253
00:15:01.631 --> 00:15:04.240
but being put on a vote twice in a row is a scary.

254
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.333
<v 0>Scary.</v>

255
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.830
<v 2>I'm gonna hit her with a low Mau Mau.</v>

256
00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:17.440
Um, what are you guys into? Marsha wants to know?

257
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:22.420
<v 4>I'm asking good question too, because I already have what I'm going to say.</v>

258
00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.120
And then if they bring the competition somewhere else.

259
00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:30.160
<v 2>And make mood boards, my dance, my dance is a sorority thing.</v>

260
00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:35.020
At least it isn't Florida state. Hey, love to serve, make mood boards. Um,

261
00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:36.090
what other quirky things.

262
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:37.400
<v 0>Keep in mind the answer.</v>

263
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.580
We don't sound like an idiot if they don't do this anywhere else,

264
00:15:39.581 --> 00:15:42.730
I'm kind of screwed the pooch on that one. But.

265
00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.290
<v 3>So I'm going to ask if there's sororities a local or national a sorority.</v>

266
00:15:47.291 --> 00:15:48.880
This is actually a pretty big one. Oh.

267
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.740
<v 0>We're just talking. Oh, I thought it was talking about hobbies.</v>

268
00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:55.630
<v 2>Okay. UCS be I like to surf. That makes sense. Right.</v>

269
00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.830
<v 3>Um, so basically now we're getting into the girl talk. Uh, Oh,</v>

270
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:04.630
I guess it might just be a photo state thing. Okay.

271
00:16:04.631 --> 00:16:08.590
So now they're just talking about line dancing. Yes, though.

272
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.600
She is literally two minutes from my apartment.

273
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:15.040
<v 2>Yeah. Beauty. Oh,</v>

274
00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.980
okay. Yeah. The ocean flirty to miss my apartments,

275
00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:21.580
but I want the little twinkly lights. Um, or the, I don't know what the star.

276
00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:23.950
<v 0>The hashtag.</v>

277
00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.510
<v 4>Like my typing style is good. I've gone to.</v>

278
00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:33.520
<v 3>And try to plan to this one just because I asked the question and we're kind of</v>

279
00:16:33.521 --> 00:16:36.780
rolling on now about just girl talk. I.

280
00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:40.570
<v 4>I seem so legit right now. So legit. I love this,</v>

281
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.310
these mutual connections that I have.

282
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.640
<v 0>Let's go with Georgia, Georgia.</v>

283
00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:54.220
<v 2>Bro. I can't spell what's going on wrong. What's your initiation.</v>

284
00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:56.300
I'm going to say, Ooh.

285
00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.990
<v 3>It's so hard to type on my laptop with long nails.</v>

286
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:06.400
Say, I'm going to say girl, I feel your pain.

287
00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:09.280
<v 2>Keep having, Oh my gosh.</v>

288
00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:12.370
I can't having to retype everything.

289
00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.880
Ours is a long process. It was moved.

290
00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:21.970
<v 4>We're talking about nails. I don't know. I ignored though.</v>

291
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.240
This initiation question could hurt me,

292
00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:28.410
but I'm going to wait. Okay.

293
00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:31.150
<v 2>Yeah. All right.</v>

294
00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.940
Let's say you want to process it has moved through the virtual platform halfway.

295
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.570
<v 3>I said, I almost broke a nail the other day.</v>

296
00:17:37.571 --> 00:17:40.060
I got so frustrated when I was typing my essay.

297
00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:45.610
<v 4>The charts thing is what stuck out to me. It's like workout group, all girls.</v>

298
00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.180
Oh, regular dude would not know about that. Me and Mikayla were homeys.

299
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:50.100
Cause uh.

300
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.780
<v 2>You know, Todd jump charge up. Let's do it.</v>

301
00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:55.260
Everyone's suspicious of her already would probably just going to vote for

302
00:17:55.261 --> 00:17:58.590
Nikita. I'm going to go with Nikita. I think if we got her out this round,

303
00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:01.170
we might just conclude the game and say, you know what? No more moles.

304
00:18:01.171 --> 00:18:02.610
I believe you guys Nikita.

305
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:06.230
<v 0>Is going to be gone only because the last two rounds.</v>

306
00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:08.300
<v 2>We were suspicious. I think it was Rachel.</v>

307
00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:11.150
It's less suspicious then because she did line dancing.

308
00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:13.040
I started I'm voted out during prep.

309
00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:18.530
The person voted out is it. Um,

310
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:20.720
I have a terrible bowl.

311
00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:24.860
I was already put on the spot literally twice if you're put on the spot.

312
00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.950
And like everyone else was like incentivized to like, you know, go for all that.

313
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:30.860
I am satisfied with the fact that like I passed two rounds.

314
00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.690
Give me a thumbs up. If you want to continue and a thumbs down,

315
00:18:35.691 --> 00:18:38.750
if you think you've caused them all in one to end the game now. Okay.

316
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:42.170
Majority thumbs down, thumbs down. Oh my God. Right?

317
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:46.790
Let's go. I am so sorry.

318
00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:50.540
Y'all they're about to be mad. Oh man. I can't believe,

319
00:18:50.541 --> 00:18:51.980
I didn't even think I was going to win it.

320
00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.840
Whoever's the mall reveal when you feel ready to do so

321
00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:09.673
nice.

322
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.120
<v 0>[Inaudible] dude, everyone's a dude.</v>

323
00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.250
Are you all in a fraternity?

324
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:34.100
<v 2>Kappa Sigma, California, Krono, mega chapter five side of this.</v>

325
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:37.610
So I'm in Phi Delta Epsilon pre-medical fraternity.

326
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.440
I thought it'd be really cool for me to join them.

327
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:42.740
Cause like I'm in a coed fraternity. So like, you know, boys, girls.

328
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.430
<v 0>Who was the person who said, I'm a girl</v>

329
00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:51.530
that I mess up big time. I was like, I'm a girl.

330
00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:55.040
So I thought it made sense in my mind. I was like, wow.

331
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:57.740
A girl is really trying to get away with that. Well,

332
00:19:57.741 --> 00:20:00.830
you guys are all gonna get 50 bucks as a

333
00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.360
[inaudible]. I need that money for rent.

334
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:09.320
There's been a ton of people asking for this episode for a while. Yeah.

335
00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.350
<v 2>I like, I always see those in like comments and I'm like, Oh.</v>

336
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:18.260
<v 0>Okay. Definitely hella good.</v>

337
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.950
All right guys. Take care. All right. Thanks guys.

338
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:28.670
<v 2>I have no words. I have no words. I'm so mad. I don't.</v>

339
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:32.510
We were all surprised. We were all. We do not expect this whatsoever.

340
00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:36.320
Y'all in the comments pile. You're like how'd you not be there as a yet?

341
00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.080
Awesome. Tik TOK, famous. Steve wears pants. Follow me.

342
00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:42.410
Shameless plug moral of the story. Men are trash.
