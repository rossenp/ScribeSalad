1
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.880
<v 0>How badly do you want to have sex? Very badly, very,</v>

2
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:10.410
very, very badly.

3
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.240
This is going to be interesting. How do you define virginity?

4
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.760
Um, it's making me think here.

5
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.070
<v 1>We're talking like heteronormative. I it's so complicated. Um,</v>

6
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.950
uh, penis.

7
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.470
<v 0>I feel like a two year old talking about this right now. Penetrative sex,</v>

8
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.300
whether that be Dick tongue, you know,

9
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.350
toy kind of thing.

10
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.120
<v 1>No, that's actually an interesting question.</v>

11
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.360
Cause like if you read the technical definition, I'm pretty sure. It says like,

12
00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.350
even like oral sex is considered losing virginity and even kissing can be

13
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.550
considered losing your virginity.

14
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.110
<v 0>Consent to is pretty much what defines your own virginity.</v>

15
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.390
<v 1>I'm a man of faith. And so I'm a believer.</v>

16
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.580
And so I definitely see sex as a responsibility.

17
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.030
Abstinence even goes further to that. When you've been looking at a girl,

18
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.840
Leslie, and looking at a girl, um, in a sexual manner,

19
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.850
just like keeping your eyes pure.

20
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.400
<v 0>How badly do you want to have sex? Very badly. Very,</v>

21
00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:29.300
very, very badly. I mean, I'm a teenager, but I'm on it.

22
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.500
I'm not a horny teenager.

23
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.520
I just never had the need or want to be honest. I haven't done anything.

24
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.240
I haven't had a boyfriend or I haven't even had my first kiss. I'm not.

25
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.340
<v 1>On the scale of how horny am I. I'm not that horny,</v>

26
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.790
but it definitely needs to happen. Definitely needs to happen.

27
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.380
It's something I get to look forward to. And so once that moment happens, uh,

28
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.000
it's going to be really amazing,

29
00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.130
but I hear that there's like an attachment and I don't want to gain that

30
00:02:01.131 --> 00:02:02.990
attachment when I'm not ready for it.

31
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.470
I've seen actually a lot of drama from it too. And so with me, I'm like,

32
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.450
I just want to get a part of that drama.

33
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.450
I feel like the only times I really like,

34
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.950
actually think about romantic relationships for sex

35
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.610
is like, when I see it in a movie and it's like, Oh, look at that.

36
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.020
And then I'm like on the couch by myself and I'm like, Oh, that would be nice.

37
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.090
Why are you a Virgin straight up? It's that just hasn't happened to me.

38
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.350
And like natural progression of life.

39
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.150
<v 0>I grew up in a Christian family that, um, believes in abstinence.</v>

40
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.170
If I have sex, I'll go to hell. So that's the only time I ever heard about it.

41
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.190
Yes. I love Jesus.

42
00:02:40.191 --> 00:02:43.850
But also I completely know I'm going to be a freak when I like lose my virginity

43
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.700
and I don't want to unleash on anyone. Who's not my husband. I'm just saying

44
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.340
I was always scared to just because like, um,

45
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.320
my parents were really young when they had me.

46
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.410
So it was just something that I didn't want to repeat. Um,

47
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.540
me and my twin were assaulted.

48
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.130
So I am a bit more careful about it, I guess,

49
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.743
in a sense,

50
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.090
I guess I am the way I am because I've been through what I've been through.

51
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.260
<v 2>I'm a Christian and I think a large part of my life.</v>

52
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.230
I like believe that premarital sex was a sin.

53
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.950
I'm like in this middle stage where I'm trying to figure it out and like reading

54
00:03:19.951 --> 00:03:23.430
books and having conversations with people as people I think are doing more

55
00:03:23.431 --> 00:03:24.241
research into that,

56
00:03:24.241 --> 00:03:27.870
they're realizing that what they believed to be like condensed.

57
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.640
Isn't exactly condemned.

58
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.560
<v 1>It says, have you ever had an orgasm? I'm a guy, you know, I fall short.</v>

59
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.710
<v 0>Yeah. Just skip it. No, I have not. Which is,</v>

60
00:03:40.711 --> 00:03:45.270
I guess that's probably why I'm like so anxious about that

61
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.600
is I don't, like, I've never done that.

62
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:49.623
<v 1>In school. Growing up,</v>

63
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.900
people would always make fun of those people who were like masturbating all the

64
00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:53.940
time. So I thought it was something stupid.

65
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.790
So I honestly never did it till I was 18 years old.

66
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.620
<v 0>I don't think I actually knew what I was doing though.</v>

67
00:03:58.621 --> 00:04:01.770
I just knew that like I would do something and it would feel really good.

68
00:04:01.771 --> 00:04:04.290
And then I was like, I should do that more. Like,

69
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.180
so my mom offered to buy me my first vibrator. She was like, Hey, um,

70
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.600
so I know you're like older and you're independent and you have like needs,

71
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.520
please try to like, make sure it's not like $200,

72
00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:18.540
but like I'll buy you like your first vibrator. And yeah. So she's amazing.

73
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.070
<v 2>Would you rather, your first time deal with a Virgin or someone experienced?</v>

74
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.840
Well, I haven't thought about that. Preferably someone with experience. I mean,

75
00:04:27.841 --> 00:04:29.850
I feel like one of us should know what we're doing. Right.

76
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.460
I feel like I'm fine either way. I don't know.

77
00:04:32.461 --> 00:04:34.920
I think there's just like the whole like insecurity thing that I would

78
00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:39.570
constantly be comparing myself to like the other person's past partners or I

79
00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:43.200
would be thinking like, am I doing this right?

80
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.280
<v 0>Honestly, I'd rather my first time be with another Virgin,</v>

81
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.550
just so I could feel comfortable though. We both don't know what we're doing.

82
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.410
<v 1>It's more about the person, you know,</v>

83
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.380
if you really are in love with them or you really have a connection with them,

84
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.363
it shouldn't matter.

85
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.420
<v 0>Are you ever embarrassed about being a Virgin? Um,</v>

86
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.990
I feel like the older I get I'm already 22.

87
00:05:03.991 --> 00:05:07.890
So it's like kind of weird, but I, I'm not going to lie.

88
00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:12.600
I do get embarrass about it sometimes. Yeah. Stigma against virgins,

89
00:05:12.601 --> 00:05:15.690
right. That you're awkward or you're weird or there's something wrong with you.

90
00:05:15.691 --> 00:05:18.150
You can't make eye contact, you can't hold a conversation.

91
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.150
And while I don't exude any of those things, like that's not me.

92
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.500
It's been my experience.

93
00:05:22.501 --> 00:05:26.460
When I have gone on dates in the past where they will take the time to get to

94
00:05:26.461 --> 00:05:29.580
know me and see like my glowing personality. And then they find out this piece,

95
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.190
I think is a very small piece about me. And all of a sudden,

96
00:05:32.191 --> 00:05:35.400
my entire being is framed by that one thing, you know,

97
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.910
I try to set my expectations upfront and initially they're like, okay,

98
00:05:38.911 --> 00:05:41.610
like I respect that. But the longer that we actually goes on,

99
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.660
they try to press you.

100
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.320
I did have this one guy call me the middle of night for five hours to tell me

101
00:05:46.321 --> 00:05:49.470
that Christianity wasn't to be all God isn't to be old. I was being ridiculous.

102
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.640
So yeah, that ended.

103
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.901
<v 1>So awkward.</v>

104
00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:55.230
Sometimes if there are people around you just trying to brag all the time,

105
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.180
kind of bragging about all the times they've had sex.

106
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.300
Like I don't even want to explain to them why.

107
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.920
So it's better just to hit that white lie. Yeah. I've had sex.

108
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.320
They're probably not going to quit. I think that they're questioning it more.

109
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:07.940
If you told them you were a Virgin,

110
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.030
then if you just lied and told them you're not a Virgin,

111
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.480
whenever we would be at a party or something like that. Oh, you're the Virgin.

112
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.700
<v 0>You're the good guy. You're the goody. Good. You know, but I think.</v>

113
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.580
<v 1>Over time it's like, I'm braced, it's one of those things. It's like,</v>

114
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:23.510
once you get to a certain point, it's like, I'm 29 shoot.

115
00:06:23.511 --> 00:06:27.860
If I'm get to the 40 year old Virgin type thing, like I'm cool with it.

116
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.410
<v 0>Have you had the chance to lose your security? The chose? Not to, yes.</v>

117
00:06:32.411 --> 00:06:36.160
I've had the chance. Yeah. I've had a chance to no.

118
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.860
Yeah, no. Um, I was in a social,

119
00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.380
um, and just very bad at talking to people and also very oblivious to flirting.

120
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.350
There's always just those people that slide into your DMS and are like, Hey,

121
00:06:50.351 --> 00:06:53.320
you want to have sex with me? I'm like stranger go away. No.

122
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.520
<v 1>Yes, yes. It was there. And uh,</v>

123
00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.170
something just told me, like, that's just, it's just not worth it.

124
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.800
<v 0>It was after like winter formal.</v>

125
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.360
And I made out with this guy he, um,

126
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.660
finished and he, um,

127
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.740
wanted to continue and stuff, but I was just like, you know,

128
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.950
I'm okay. Do you ever regret.

129
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:22.961
<v 1>Really?</v>

130
00:07:22.961 --> 00:07:26.320
Because a lot of those chances are like a party situation or like you're drunk,

131
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:26.890
they're drunk.

132
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:30.550
It's not like it was a romantic situation where it was super intimate and you

133
00:07:30.551 --> 00:07:31.780
just missed out because you were scared.

134
00:07:31.781 --> 00:07:35.020
So I really don't feel like I missed out in those scenarios.

135
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:40.480
<v 0>Do you watch porn? When I was like younger, it was, um,</v>

136
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.420
Tumblr born and it was like, this is like,

137
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.700
is anybody watching close my door,

138
00:07:45.701 --> 00:07:49.480
lock my door and make sure no one knows this is happening. And then be like,

139
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:54.850
Oh my gosh, it's so awkward. I'm like, these people are doing it on camera.

140
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.410
<v 2>I don't watch porn now.</v>

141
00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.910
But I think there was like a big part of my like life everyday,

142
00:08:00.911 --> 00:08:05.230
like watching porn. I think like it did get to the point of addiction,

143
00:08:05.231 --> 00:08:07.990
this constant reminding of like, this is really bad. This is really bad.

144
00:08:07.991 --> 00:08:09.550
And you like beat yourself up about it.

145
00:08:09.551 --> 00:08:13.450
And you're like not telling anybody about it because you just assume that none

146
00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:16.150
of your friends are watching porn. Porn is also like something where like,

147
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:20.140
even like, I'm rethinking a lot when I like Morling lean towards, like,

148
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:24.010
I don't know if porn is bad when my viewpoint shifted. I just like,

149
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.700
there wasn't anything that I was fighting anymore.

150
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.490
So I just stopped watching porn.

151
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.140
<v 1>If you can differentiate that porn isn't real life from the fact that it is like</v>

152
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.240
porn as strictly an entertainment thing.

153
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.750
As long as you're consuming and moderation, shouldn't be a problem.

154
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:45.310
<v 2>Are you afraid for your first time? Uh, yeah,</v>

155
00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:50.320
totally me and like someone else just being that intimate with each

156
00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:54.430
other and revealing that much of yourself to someone else is just

157
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.550
intimidating. I am not.

158
00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:00.570
<v 0>Because I kind of dislike. If I trust this person,</v>

159
00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:02.610
then I shouldn't have a reason to be afraid.

160
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.850
I'm afraid of it not meeting my expectations.

161
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.390
I think since I've had so long to fantasize about it,

162
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.900
I have all these like visions of like, Oh my gosh, we're going to be like sat.

163
00:09:12.901 --> 00:09:15.000
And she's with bros, pedals and kettles.

164
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:16.830
And I think I've amped it up a lot in my head.

165
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.670
I'm afraid I'm not going to get any pleasure out of it. Cause there's the huge,

166
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.270
like stereotype is it's pleasure for the guy and the girl doesn't get anything.

167
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.680
Um, I'm pansexual. And if I do end up having a male partner in that happening,

168
00:09:28.681 --> 00:09:29.790
that would really suck.

169
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:33.690
So I did hear from friends that it's not going to be very pleasant and I know

170
00:09:33.691 --> 00:09:34.560
it's going to be awkward,

171
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.080
but that's why I hope it's with the right person just so we can laugh it off

172
00:09:37.081 --> 00:09:37.914
afterwards.

173
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.620
<v 3>I see myself after like the wedding, um, you know,</v>

174
00:09:42.621 --> 00:09:45.170
where it's like going back to the room. Yeah.

175
00:09:45.171 --> 00:09:48.200
And then there's a special moment where I actually,

176
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.140
this is actually something I think that would be really surprising for a lot of

177
00:09:51.141 --> 00:09:55.070
people is I actually want to pray. This is gonna be crazy. It's cause I'm crazy.

178
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.720
I, I think it'll be a beautiful,

179
00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:59.690
beautiful thing to be able to actually like pray and stuff like while do it

180
00:09:59.691 --> 00:10:03.410
sounds crazy, but like, I just think it was so beautiful. I don't, so yeah.
