1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.660
<v 0>With your spells. Do you have like, people drink like pigs, blood or something?</v>

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.130
Oh God. No. Okay. I don't know. Better.

3
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.090
<v 1>Talk about some topics are hard to express</v>

4
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.540
either the subjects are inaccessible

5
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.890
or people are uncomfortable discussing.

6
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.120
So we found those subjects in person rented a space in Los Angeles and invited

7
00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:33.140
our audiences, strangers to come and ask them anything.

8
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.510
<v 2>Hi, my name's Griffin.</v>

9
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.280
I am a professional witch and I'm here today to answer questions on the

10
00:00:40.281 --> 00:00:42.680
topic. Anything anybody would like to ask?

11
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.280
<v 0>Hi Griffin, I'm Erin two A's biblical name, right?</v>

12
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.600
Kind of a Christian name.

13
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.850
<v 2>You didn't bring a Pitchfork today. Did you?</v>

14
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.750
<v 0>Oh, what? Which thing they always would proceed. It just cause you know,</v>

15
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.793
from movies, like.

16
00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.993
<v 2>Female thing,</v>

17
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.790
that was a lot of people think that there is a higher percentage of women,

18
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.080
but not exclusive at all.

19
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.490
And a lot of the people responsible for the revival of witchcraft have been men.

20
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.550
<v 0>Is being a witch. Like you're.</v>

21
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.680
<v 2>That's what I do for a living.</v>

22
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.540
I teach witchcraft and I run a witchcraft store and I sent a

23
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.450
big rituals and do all kinds of things.

24
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.750
<v 0>Or a bad witch. Oh.</v>

25
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.450
<v 2>Yes I am. I'm not a nice wage, but I'm a good wage.</v>

26
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.580
I don't go out of my way to be nice to people,

27
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.800
but I hope my ethics very close to my heart. I would not do magic.

28
00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:39.770
That would use SERP. The Liberty of freedom of others.

29
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.260
<v 0>I feel the way witches are being portrayed.</v>

30
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.350
Do like social media or like in movies?

31
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.680
<v 2>Well, I think it would be portrayed actually in a fun way.</v>

32
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.060
It's it's not very realistic. I don't fly on Brahms and uh,

33
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.350
people really don't understand witchcraft. They see witchcraft from Hollywood.

34
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.440
They see witchcraft through the filter of history, but they don't,

35
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.850
it's very difficult to understand what we're about from the outside.

36
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.930
I've come to accept that. I can't really explain it to people and that's okay.

37
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.980
<v 0>Like Catholic or Muslim or Buddhist. Could you practice kind of the,</v>

38
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.200
which style even though you're not maybe like a Wiccan,

39
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.820
like how does that work out? Religious ones?

40
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.040
<v 2>You can be a witch and you can be a Christian.</v>

41
00:02:19.041 --> 00:02:21.950
You can be a witch and you can be an atheist. Um,

42
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.570
but people who practice old time,

43
00:02:23.571 --> 00:02:28.550
witchcraft very often have the ability to perceive energy and

44
00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:31.190
spirits and manipulate change.

45
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.450
So that's helpful for when communicating with nature,

46
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.890
different kinds of spirits in the land or doing healing work, uh,

47
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.350
being able to work with crystals and stones.

48
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.450
<v 0>How did you fall into being a wedge? Like,</v>

49
00:02:44.451 --> 00:02:47.270
did you feel like you had a gift or something or did you just.

50
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.190
<v 2>My mother, her mother before her, um, had what they call the gifts.</v>

51
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.270
She was in her seventies and decided that it was time to cross over.

52
00:02:56.271 --> 00:02:59.000
So she drowned herself in a bucket of water. Oh.

53
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.380
Which is not an easy thing to do, but she was ready.

54
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.010
It was because she was aware of the spirit realm. And she said, you know,

55
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:07.780
I've had a really long life and I'm done,

56
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:12.430
I'm ready to cross over a year after she crossed I was born and my

57
00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:15.460
grandmother looked at me and basically said, Oh,

58
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.070
you've received the gifts from her mother.

59
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.040
<v 0>Have you ever cast a spell on yourself before? And would you recommend it?</v>

60
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.830
<v 2>Yeah, actually I know it sounds kind of weird.</v>

61
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.520
People come in wanting you to cast spells on other people.

62
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.990
I want that boyfriend or I want that girlfriend and I want you to make them love

63
00:03:33.991 --> 00:03:38.890
me and this, like, no, I'm not going to do that. If you want to be loved,

64
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.510
then you need to start finding a way to love yourself.

65
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.880
People see you differently when you see yourself differently.

66
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.300
So a lot of spoke crafting is actually done on oneself. Strangely enough,

67
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.450
love yourself, love yourself.

68
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.790
<v 0>It's going to be like a dumb question, but like,</v>

69
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.420
have you ever like experienced like sort of like a witch fight?

70
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.600
<v 2>Oh my God, you're going in there. All right. Um, yeah, you know,</v>

71
00:04:03.601 --> 00:04:05.640
I'd love to say that that, which is,

72
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.880
are all wonderfully enlightened and tolerant and loving,

73
00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:12.900
but actually there's a hell of a lot of which was go on where, Oh,

74
00:04:12.901 --> 00:04:16.680
so-and-so said this about you and sciences and that's just normal,

75
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.590
like high school drama. But with witches,

76
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.540
it gets also into where they start throwing spells and uh,

77
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.870
and trying to mess with your life. And the silly thing is,

78
00:04:27.871 --> 00:04:30.210
is if you do witchcraft against another person,

79
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.160
then whatever you do against them opens the door that they can do the same thing

80
00:04:35.161 --> 00:04:39.270
back at you or other people can do that kind of magic on you because once the

81
00:04:39.271 --> 00:04:43.230
door is opened in, in what you endorse in your reality,

82
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.970
then that becomes something that is always going to be a power in your,

83
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.893
in your world.

84
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.920
<v 0>GK exists in a sense of like what we see in movies or anything,</v>

85
00:04:52.921 --> 00:04:55.170
or is it more a spirituality type thing?

86
00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.480
<v 2>You know, uh, both, maybe 90% of my practice.</v>

87
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.430
It is about how to see a bigger universe and to live in a bigger

88
00:05:05.431 --> 00:05:06.870
spiritual based world.

89
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.360
But then there's 10% of the practice where magic becomes very real.

90
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.740
When you see things happen that physically shouldn't be possible,

91
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.120
but it's not something that you are able to conjure up on a daily basis.

92
00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:24.750
It's not like a waste where you wiggle your nose and the housework started,

93
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.770
or the dishes take care of themselves. What do you think of Christianity?

94
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.110
I like Christianity in terms of Christ. And in terms of the, uh,

95
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.010
the scripture, what I'm not a big fan of is churchianity,

96
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.260
I don't like the way in which priesthood in all religions and all mainstream

97
00:05:43.261 --> 00:05:47.040
religions, um, mediate the scriptures, um,

98
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.510
because it seems to be geared towards fundamentalism, um, bigotry.

99
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:52.950
Uh closed-mindedness.

100
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.160
<v 0>Have you faced any like negativity to you being so open? What, well.</v>

101
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.600
<v 2>Yeah, I mean, when I first started, um, I wouldn't admit it to anybody. I mean,</v>

102
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.850
people would think I was nuts and in America,

103
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.390
even where there's still a degree of persecution, so we keep,

104
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.750
we keep kind of quiet about who we are and what we're doing.

105
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.260
<v 3>What's something about like being a witch that most people don't really know.</v>

106
00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.100
<v 2>They're just like regular people. Um,</v>

107
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.050
I know which is who are doctors and surgeons and lawyers and

108
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.120
in every area of the world, there are people who you don't know,

109
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.190
which is so the fact that, you know,

110
00:06:33.191 --> 00:06:37.300
we come in all in all colors in all flavors fact that we actually are decent

111
00:06:37.301 --> 00:06:41.380
people. I want people to realize that we hold value in the world,

112
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.340
that we have a place and that we aren't scary people.

113
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.350
We're actually kind of cool with it.

114
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.420
<v 3>If you could recollect, what is your greatest or fondest journey?</v>

115
00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:55.661
<v 2>Um, well,</v>

116
00:06:55.661 --> 00:06:59.410
there's a number of workings that I've done over the years with other people

117
00:06:59.411 --> 00:07:03.070
where we have been out in nature. And, uh,

118
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:08.080
and we have seen things that have basically taken our

119
00:07:08.081 --> 00:07:10.240
understanding of reality and shredded it,

120
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.190
where we have seen spirits of people become manifest,

121
00:07:15.191 --> 00:07:19.930
where we've watched fire take foam and reach out like a hand and touch

122
00:07:19.931 --> 00:07:20.764
people.

123
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.800
The thing that's the most important to me and the thing that I get the biggest

124
00:07:23.801 --> 00:07:28.210
reward from actually is working with people today and,

125
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:33.220
and seeing the light go on in their eyes when they start to realize that

126
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.640
that there's more to the world and that it can be an adventure.

127
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:42.400
And I feel like I've made a difference and that really makes me feel good. Well,

128
00:07:42.401 --> 00:07:43.540
thanks guys for watching.

129
00:07:43.541 --> 00:07:47.830
I hopefully you learned a thing or two about witchcraft and

130
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.570
continue to seek. If you have interests, seek out your metaphysical stores.

131
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.750
<v 3>And please remember to comment below what you thought of the episode,</v>

132
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.320
consider liking and subscribing as well. And we will see you next time.

133
00:07:59.950 --> 00:07:59.950
<v 2>Right?</v>
