1
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.551
<v 0>Should we rank herself.</v>

2
00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:08.190
She would just like close her eyes and like scoot to where we think we should go

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.980
here. How are we not going to bump into each other?

4
00:00:09.981 --> 00:00:12.290
Did anyone take this into consideration? Sorry.

5
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.680
Can we say like what we do? Or like, so I'm a dancer.

6
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.620
I'm very physical. I use my body a lot. I love baking cakes.

7
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.570
I always just like shove baked goods on my friends.

8
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.340
I teach acting to young kids. I do mostly musical theater because I'm a weenie.

9
00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:51.500
I know. Um, but I'm single as all.

10
00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:55.490
Heck I am a journalism major.

11
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.960
I'm also a student I'm double majoring in psychology and criminal justice.

12
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.240
I'm also an actress. I love to travel. I've been to India five times.

13
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.520
We have to do this. Can we rank herself?

14
00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:11.000
Should we just close our eyes and like scoop where we think we should then?

15
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.870
You know what I mean? Just go for it an individual basis. Very smart.

16
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.110
I feel like my personality is really attractive. My looks, I feel like I'm like,

17
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.980
okay. Like I don't think anyone would look at me and be like, who ha, Oh,

18
00:01:24.981 --> 00:01:27.530
I'm nervous. How are we not going to bump into each other?

19
00:01:27.531 --> 00:01:31.190
Did anyone take this into consideration? Sorry. We're all so humble. But like

20
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.340
what if you don't know?

21
00:01:34.341 --> 00:01:38.690
Like which one is the number I saw almost s'mores too.

22
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.370
I didn't know where y'all were standing.

23
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.870
That girl who I found most attractive was Jordan.

24
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.040
She has a great personality and she's confident, dope. Oh, see,

25
00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:53.930
I thought this is wait,

26
00:01:53.931 --> 00:01:55.600
wait, wait, wait. It's five two.

27
00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:59.570
How did I end up here?

28
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.900
Can we do it off as like immediate first impression and attraction to the

29
00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:06.770
person? I'm just going to put it out there. Just say, just let me do it. One,

30
00:02:06.771 --> 00:02:11.720
two, three, four, Oh, sorry. One,

31
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.530
two, three, four, one, two, three, four. Got it.

32
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.590
Um, one, two, three, four. Okay. One, two, three, four.

33
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.970
Okay. I'll be two because I got all 14. Okay. I think I got three,

34
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.190
four of the most, so I'll stick into that window.

35
00:02:31.191 --> 00:02:32.270
Depending on the other persons,

36
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.960
there were attributes that I saw in the other girls that I didn't see in myself.

37
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.650
And hence I would've put them higher as well over me. So people are like, Oh,

38
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.760
she's so sweet. She's so funny. She looks, but like I wouldn't dinner.

39
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.360
I guess I'll be one. Okay. Okay. Cool.

40
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.250
Thanks so much dearly. And I would date a three.

41
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.670
Okay. Yeah. I'll just stay here. Yeah.

42
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.410
Nobody really wanted to be lost and I could kind of feel that vibe.

43
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.310
So I was just like, you know, it's fine. Like nobody is a five really?

44
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.820
I don't think so. But I mean,

45
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.640
where do you think you would fit yourself into something? Uh, well, I mean,

46
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:15.010
I don't know, because I feel like personality is a big thing

47
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.140
too. I would say three.

48
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.490
Let's say you don't have a personality, but I'm like, Oh, I'm five again.

49
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.280
I think we just put ourselves in order of most extroverted,

50
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:33.550
not the most personality. So this is fine. This is fine.

51
00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.580
Do you want to start over there?

52
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.600
<v 1>Like just shift down. I think Michelle was the most attractive, how she looked,</v>

53
00:04:06.601 --> 00:04:09.750
how she carried herself and it just seems like someone that's going to live an

54
00:04:09.751 --> 00:04:11.100
exciting life. I guess you could say,

55
00:04:11.101 --> 00:04:13.590
or that you can have like a deep conversation with, could you.

56
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.040
<v 0>I forgot. They can't even hear me. Well,</v>

57
00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:25.350
what would you switch? I switched here you go.

58
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.603
Over there.

59
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.710
<v 2>Personally, for me,</v>

60
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.760
she kind of looks like Kristen bell and I really liked Chris and Mel, sorry,

61
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.260
Twitter. And on the one or two position. And I kind of like her vibe.

62
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.010
I think her whole aesthetic is very nice. So for me,

63
00:04:50.011 --> 00:04:51.780
it's either one or two up here.

64
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.390
I think that Maria was the most attractive for me.

65
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.300
It was just like her whole vibe. And like, I liked how her hair was,

66
00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.730
how her makeup was done. Like she looked very nice.

67
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.130
Are we content with five being five Or at least three?

68
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.130
So five goes up. She should be a four because it's like meeting the middle.

69
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.670
<v 0>Five and four switch.</v>

70
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.040
<v 2>We're going to rip the new one.</v>

71
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.580
<v 1>That's a good pointer here. Guys are not afraid to be more blunt.</v>

72
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.520
They were straight up. Hey, you're attractive. You're attractive. You're not.

73
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.040
But girls were like, I don't want to be rude. You know,

74
00:05:23.041 --> 00:05:25.350
we're all beautiful in our own way. Are we good?

75
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:26.850
<v 0>We're good. I'm good.</v>

76
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.463
I feel bad.

77
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.990
<v 1>The way the guys were ranking the girls.</v>

78
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.540
I actually think we were doing it mostly by personality.

79
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.870
I was super anxious about ranking. My hands were getting all clammy.

80
00:05:54.871 --> 00:05:58.130
I was like really uncomfortable being the one to be like putting.

81
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.630
<v 2>Them where I thought it's obviously something that we do like in day-to-day life</v>

82
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.790
would rank people subconsciously,

83
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.410
but having to do it like in front of them and like them watching you ranked

84
00:06:08.411 --> 00:06:11.420
them, was it wasn't fun, but definitely a memorable experience

85
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.533
while I was at five.

86
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.760
<v 0>And now I'm here. So I'm like, thank you. I don't know. It's very interesting.</v>

87
00:06:18.761 --> 00:06:20.650
I feel, I did think coming into this,

88
00:06:20.651 --> 00:06:23.050
like cultural stereotypes would be a factor.

89
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.200
Them raking me first kind of shot that down I guess,

90
00:06:26.201 --> 00:06:29.110
because I didn't think they would choose like an Asian girl first.

91
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:34.000
I think when I think of a male viewing me as attractive or not versus a female,

92
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.600
it's definitely different because in a male setting, if of judging me,

93
00:06:37.601 --> 00:06:40.090
I knew that was going to happen. Like I'm not stupid.

94
00:06:40.091 --> 00:06:43.900
So like I'm aware of how others view me.

95
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.640
I was surprised at them placing me at the bottom. But at the same time,

96
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.660
I know out of a room of beautiful girls that I was put in that from the jump

97
00:06:52.661 --> 00:06:57.040
there was, there was no chance for me. I was, yeah, that chance there,

98
00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:02.140
me being the only black girl, like I knew that I wouldn't be rank,

99
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.193
right? Yeah.

100
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.350
American beauty standards versus what people see people of color it's different.

101
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.450
But guys that I interact with,

102
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.470
they socialize more with black women and they think more black women are

103
00:07:14.471 --> 00:07:15.310
attractive.

104
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.810
I think that the guys ranked the woman from appearance more than personality.

105
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.100
Most of the time,

106
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.200
I feel like it just confirms that attractiveness is so subjective and circled

107
00:07:29.201 --> 00:07:32.200
and presented in one way. And always has been,

108
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:35.140
even though I have my days where I'm like, Oh,

109
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:39.400
you not really that cute and days where I'm like, Ooh, you like you,

110
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.510
you cute. I would say I wouldn't change.

111
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.090
I wouldn't change.

112
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.140
I feel like he, he would give you flowers, timeout

113
00:07:59.860 --> 00:07:59.860
movies.
