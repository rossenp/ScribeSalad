00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.710
<v 0>What's your favorite animal? Oh mom. Oh my God. She's so cute.</v>

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.290
<v 1>We brought together 17 moms.</v>

3
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.000
<v 0>I am a teen mom. I am a teen mom. I am a teen mom. I'm a teen mom.</v>

4
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.890
I'm a teen mom. I'm a teen mom.

5
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.160
<v 1>No one is a liar. If the group discovers who the liar is,</v>

6
00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:25.940
they'll win a cash prize. If the liar survives, they win the cash prize.

7
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.510
This is old man out.

8
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.810
<v 0>Having a baby, like your life just changes like that.</v>

9
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.220
I think what's going to set the mole and a real teen mom apart. Is the details,

10
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.610
have you lost or have you gained friends? Are you still with your baby's father?

11
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.030
Oh, I definitely wouldn't have known what the hell goes on during the postpartum

12
00:00:47.031 --> 00:00:49.970
stage or like after birth. So off. If I do too much,

13
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.640
people are going to be suspicious of me and think that I'm like overdoing it.

14
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.380
I feel confident, but I'm nervous. The mole will probably be like a nanny,

15
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.060
like a big sister.

16
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.590
Hi, how old everyone is. Wait, the babies are us both.

17
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.240
I turned 18 in August and my baby's 10 months, but he turns 11 months tomorrow.

18
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.850
Almost a year. Oh my goodness. That's so exciting.

19
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.920
I am 15 and my baby is four months. I'm 19.

20
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.510
My daughter just turned 21 months today. I'm 17 and I've got an eight month old.

21
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.890
I am 19 and I have a two-year-old daughter. I just turned 18.

22
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.040
My daughter's two and a half. She just turned two in April.

23
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.700
I'm 14 and I have an eight month old and she turns one in March.

24
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.120
So how about you? His birth story? How long were you guys in labor?

25
00:01:38.121 --> 00:01:42.740
I was in labor for 47 hours. It was miserable, but of course it was worth it.

26
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.100
I was in labor for 11 hours. I'm jealous. Labor is good.

27
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.520
Did you guys have epidurals? Did you guys go natural? I had an epidural.

28
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.110
I can't do natural. Did anybody get induced? Like half and half?

29
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.190
Like they broke my water. I didn't even want an epidural, but at like 38 hours,

30
00:01:58.191 --> 00:01:59.990
I was like, I'm either gonna, yeah, I was like,

31
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:03.830
I'm going to have to have a C-section no strength left in my body.

32
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.450
I only got to six centimeters.

33
00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:09.080
That's why I had to have a C-section your body wouldn't progress? Um,

34
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.980
the umbilical cord was wrapped around her neck. Say my baby.

35
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.340
He came out all blue and purple. It was, he didn't even cry when he came out.

36
00:02:16.341 --> 00:02:20.840
I was literally so slider my baby. Didn't either when I didn't hear him cry,

37
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.800
I was just like, please tell me my baby. I bet your heart just drop.

38
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.070
They don't cry for awhile though. Like you think they'll cry,

39
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.080
but I've heard lots of the movies.

40
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.790
<v 1>We just all seem like we were just.</v>

41
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.550
<v 0>Teen moms just chatting and having a good time.</v>

42
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.260
I like hearing like everyone's stories.

43
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.520
Cause I know not everyone's flavor is the exact same. So it's like nice to hear.

44
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.610
I feel like Emma is actually a mom and I feel like, so Shauna, the other three,

45
00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:50.060
they were quite quiet so far. I'm the most suspicious of Kira.

46
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.970
This is a total random guest. I'm so sorry, girl,

47
00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:55.970
but I will have to vote for you. Emma really stuck out to me.

48
00:02:55.971 --> 00:03:00.070
She is who I will be voting on. I am definitely most of Kiana.

49
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:03.220
I think I'm saying her name, right? I think I'm going to vote for Kimberly.

50
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.420
I don't know I'm going to go off Kimberly. I'm kind of suspicious of Kayla.

51
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.690
I think this round I'm going to vote up Kayla. I'm so sorry, girl.

52
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.550
She was just not giving me mom vibes.

53
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.500
<v 1>The votes are in and we have a tie between Kimberly and Kayla.</v>

54
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.110
So we're going into a tie breaker.

55
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.330
Each one of you will get 20 seconds to state your case. First up is Kayla.

56
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.990
<v 0>So I realized that I was pregnant when I was 16,</v>

57
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.810
gave birth 17 I'm 18 years old.

58
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.100
I'm bouncing school while raising my 10 with baby. My mom was a teen mom.

59
00:03:35.101 --> 00:03:38.730
So like, it was just like really hard having to come out with that.

60
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.690
Cause I feel like it made it seem like I was like following her footsteps.

61
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.300
And she was like really disappointed about that. So that was like really hard.

62
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.380
I found out I was pregnant July 19 with my boyfriend.

63
00:03:49.381 --> 00:03:51.900
He bought me the pregnancy test. I told my mom, well,

64
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.260
she found out because she noticed, cause I was really open about my periods,

65
00:03:55.261 --> 00:03:55.590
her,

66
00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.060
she made me take a pregnancy test in front of her and my dad was outside the

67
00:04:00.061 --> 00:04:01.830
restroom. We told the school,

68
00:04:01.831 --> 00:04:05.910
they had found resources and I'm moving to a school for pregnant teens and teen

69
00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:06.744
moms.

70
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.550
<v 1>The boats for the tie breaker are in and the teen mom eliminated in round one</v>

71
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.980
is Kayla.

72
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.620
<v 0>Hi, sorry girl. I genuinely thought she was a teen mom.</v>

73
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.300
I had the boat for Kayla just because Kimberly had a strong

74
00:04:30.301 --> 00:04:33.960
story. I wish I would've stayed longer. I really want to just show my baby.

75
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.160
She is a pretty good baby.

76
00:04:38.161 --> 00:04:41.730
She only cries when she's trying to go to sleep and you will not stand up. See

77
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.220
right now she's learning how to use her hands and stuff. Cause she's so young.

78
00:04:47.221 --> 00:04:50.580
I don't really have like her favorite things, but she does love cocoa Mellon.

79
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.180
Like if she sleep and I put cocoa melanin, she'll wake up and watch it.

80
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.460
She loves animals. This girl,

81
00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.540
this girl is not afraid of anything. We have a bearded dragon.

82
00:05:00.541 --> 00:05:03.000
Her name is saffron. The second she walks in,

83
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.530
nobody doesn't have a smile on their face. He's currently teething.

84
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.510
So he's having a lot of sleepless nights,

85
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.270
which is why he's actually up this late because I'm in the UK.

86
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.630
He is usually all around a happy little boy, giggling, smiling,

87
00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:17.520
always talking and interrupting.

88
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.720
Her favorite thing is cocoa Mellon and she loves swatch and gloopy.

89
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.290
She loves to do little dance parties. What's your favorite color?

90
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.190
What's your favorite animal? Um, Oh,

91
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.050
well her very animal Elmo. Apparently her dad is not informal,

92
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.370
but she's still thriving. She likes eating a lot. Everything I eat,

93
00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:40.500
she eats too. She crawls a lot.

94
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.360
She's very talkative and very friendly.

95
00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:46.860
Like she won't cry with anyone

96
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.360
she's hungry right now.

97
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.410
Her favorite things are unicorns dressing up.

98
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.890
Being a princess you love is, huh?

99
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.010
<v 2>It was kind of a fight to get her out of a princess dress today.</v>

100
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:08.030
But we managed to do it right? Oh yeah.

101
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.450
Whenever you meet her, she just like, won't say much and she's pretty reserved.

102
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.313
Perfect.

103
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.840
<v 0>I thought he was really cool. Seeing all the babies,</v>

104
00:06:16.841 --> 00:06:19.060
they all looked exactly like their moms.

105
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.960
Like people might suspect me because I have a toddler and the rest of them had

106
00:06:22.961 --> 00:06:25.090
like babies who were like super attached to them.

107
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.940
I don't know if we've got them all now. I don't think Kayla was the moment.

108
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.060
I still have a really weird suspicion about Kimberly.

109
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.680
I'm just going to go with Kim. Really? No valid explanation.

110
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.860
I am going to go with Emma this time. Like I did before.

111
00:06:38.861 --> 00:06:41.370
Just because in this situation against the other girls,

112
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.930
other girls are kind of a little bit calmer than her.

113
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.550
If I had to vote for someone now.

114
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.010
<v 2>I think I would vote for it. Yeah.</v>

115
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.920
<v 0>I want to say I'm kind of suspicious of Kiana.</v>

116
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.320
So I figured out how to say Kian his name.

117
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.070
And I say I'm still most suspicious about birth when I'm scared.

118
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.950
<v 2>I knew it. I thought it was gonna be me.</v>

119
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.670
<v 0>I didn't really have too much to say about my child because she is so young.</v>

120
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:10.660
All the other moms had a lot to say, but we will see,

121
00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.280
I had thought I was pregnant for like a couple of weeks,

122
00:07:15.281 --> 00:07:19.300
but I was kind of in denial. And so my boyfriend, my now fiance,

123
00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.960
but he was my boyfriend at the time. Congratulations. Thank you.

124
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.550
And so we had stopped at seven 11 to grab some candy and some snacks to sneak

125
00:07:27.551 --> 00:07:30.880
into the movie theater. I just got like the cheapest pregnancy test.

126
00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.270
And then I took it in the movie theater bathroom. When I came out,

127
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:38.230
he just could read my face and he said, you're pregnant. Aren't you? And I said,

128
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:42.040
yep. And he goes, well, we'll figure it out. You've never broken up.

129
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.220
He's always been the best dad. So I was so good.

130
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.360
And I hid my pregnancy. My parents found out, yeah, surprise.

131
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:52.840
Literally everybody was like, Oh yeah,

132
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.670
but I didn't show like at all.

133
00:07:54.671 --> 00:07:59.170
And I just wear a sweatshirt and I worked two jobs the whole time I was

134
00:07:59.171 --> 00:08:03.550
pregnant so we could support her in. Yeah, that's my story. My mom,

135
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:07.900
I actually got grounded and I was in trouble and she took away my phone.

136
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.410
I did a text, my friend on messenger on my computer.

137
00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.200
And I was telling her that I had like a bunch of symptoms.

138
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.620
Cause she also a teen mom and she said, yeah, you're pregnant.

139
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.440
And my mom had seen the texts coming through my phone.

140
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:25.180
So she read them and just let loose on me.

141
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:28.780
And then once my dad found out, he was the most supportive.

142
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:32.530
My dad is like very religious. So he's like things happen for a reason,

143
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:34.210
but I stay in supportive parents.

144
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.990
One thing that happened when I was in high school, I wrote a lot of judgment.

145
00:08:37.991 --> 00:08:41.830
So I had to move to online school and some people actually TV in my house.

146
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.100
I was pregnant. That was horrible and row

147
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.280
and Whoa, that's.

148
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.290
<v 2>Terrible. I'm so sorry. I had to go through that.</v>

149
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.440
<v 0>It wasn't in June. I was getting period cramps, but period,</v>

150
00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:57.420
wasn't coming. So I Googled that up.

151
00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:59.490
And the first thing that came up was pregnancy.

152
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.910
I had told my boyfriend and he came over to my house,

153
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:07.710
but this was in July and he brought the pregnancy test and I took it and he was

154
00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:11.250
happy. But um, I kind of had a blank expression on my face.

155
00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:13.920
I didn't really know what to think. I didn't want to believe it.

156
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.540
I'm so emotional.

157
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:24.240
I cry when other people cry and my parents found out in

158
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.980
August because they noticed that I wasn't getting my

159
00:09:28.981 --> 00:09:32.250
period. I told a couple of friends and they told me to abort,

160
00:09:32.251 --> 00:09:34.020
but I knew I wasn't going to do that.

161
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.830
Me and my boyfriend have been together for almost three years in February.

162
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.500
Everyone knows my baby now. And

163
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.030
Oh girl. Yeah. That's it like,

164
00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.790
I'm really happy with how my life is right now.

165
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:52.170
I love that for anything. Okay.

166
00:09:52.171 --> 00:09:54.800
So I was 15. When I found out I was pregnant.

167
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.660
The first person I told was obviously my boyfriend, whose name is duck.

168
00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.240
We didn't plan it. But he was like, no, you've got to keep that.

169
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.130
We're amazing together. We're going to start a life together.

170
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.050
Both my parents were really, really supportive.

171
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.870
They explored so many roots of what I could have gone through.

172
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.600
And it was amazing to have that support, especially from parents.

173
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.480
But then about five months down the pregnancy line,

174
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.690
me and my boyfriend actually broke up. We completely blocked teacher though.

175
00:10:15.691 --> 00:10:18.960
We didn't talk to each other enough, saw each other on his due date.

176
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.990
He actually got back in contact with me and then we got back together and then

177
00:10:21.991 --> 00:10:26.340
our son was born four days later. Um, and we're still together now.

178
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:27.440
So.

179
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.380
<v 2>No, I was pregnant at 15.</v>

180
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:34.220
My school is like a high school that also has an infant lab in the school,

181
00:10:34.221 --> 00:10:35.840
which is like a daycare type thing.

182
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:38.330
So they have a teen clinic where they like do like pregnancy tests,

183
00:10:38.331 --> 00:10:40.340
like STD checks, like literally everything.

184
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:44.150
One day I went there after school with one of my good friends and I found out I

185
00:10:44.151 --> 00:10:45.200
was pregnant there.

186
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.990
The doctor just kind of walked into the room and she was like, stood there.

187
00:10:47.991 --> 00:10:50.750
So I'm like, Oh boy, like, there we go. Yeah.

188
00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:55.610
I kind of knew like from her like expression that I was pregnant and me and my

189
00:10:55.611 --> 00:10:58.880
boyfriend were only together for, it was like a month at the time.

190
00:10:58.881 --> 00:11:00.830
And he was 14 and I was 15.

191
00:11:00.831 --> 00:11:03.620
He was just mainly really scared to tell his parents. Yeah.

192
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:06.980
My parents were super supportive though. My mom was a teen mom herself.

193
00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.830
Thankfully the school I go to has an infant lab, a daycare thing.

194
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:13.310
I'm able to bring her to school with me still. And this year is my last year.

195
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:15.410
<v 0>Woo. I'll wait.</v>

196
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:18.020
<v 2>To graduate. Oh my goodness. I'm going to be the first in my family.</v>

197
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:19.790
It's going to be so it's amazing.

198
00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.990
<v 0>I live the mole is a really good actor or we already got it.</v>

199
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.330
I'm not suspicious of any line. I don't,

200
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:30.440
unfortunately I'm going to vote Shanna out this round.

201
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:35.120
I really hate to because she seems really nice. If we didn't vote out the movie,

202
00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:40.070
I'm going to be mad. I am suspicious of Kira and I'm going to be voting for her.

203
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:44.090
I'm still very, very suspicious of Kimberley in the 20 seconds about me.

204
00:11:44.091 --> 00:11:47.090
Like her tie breaker. I swear. She said her parents found out,

205
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.030
bought her pregnancy test because I have to vote for one.

206
00:11:50.031 --> 00:11:54.490
I'm going to say Kimberly, just for the fact that she had the least.

207
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:58.570
<v 2>Detailed. She was the least descriptive. I think I'm going to vote for Kimberly.</v>

208
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.990
I'm so sorry. I had no idea who to vote for. I feel bad. I'm sorry.

209
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:12.160
I feel like maybe I don't know. I guess when I'm washing her,

210
00:12:12.161 --> 00:12:13.330
whenever I told the story.

211
00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:17.640
<v 1>Give me a thumbs up. If you want to continue the game, if not,</v>

212
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:21.270
give me a thumbs down and you think you caught them all and want to end the game

213
00:12:21.271 --> 00:12:22.104
right now.

214
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:27.240
<v 2>This is so nerve wracking.</v>

215
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.180
<v 1>If the color that shows up is green, you all win. If it's red, the fake team,</v>

216
00:12:33.181 --> 00:12:36.510
mom is still in the game and you all lost in three.

217
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:38.303
<v 2>Two. What</v>

218
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.793
[inaudible], who was it?

219
00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.390
<v 1>The game is over and the teen moms have one.</v>

220
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:58.710
We're also going to be gifting them the akin to experience where they'll get to

221
00:12:58.711 --> 00:13:02.130
pick their favorite basics from our new interactive apparel brand.

222
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.300
I would like the mall to please reveal yourself in three.

223
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.750
<v 2>I knew it. I knew it</v>

224
00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:20.190
did good. Good job. That is one cute baby though. Oh my goodness.

225
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:22.710
Whose baby is it? And my mom's baby.

226
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.560
I knew it. When you go out to people think it's yours. Um, sometimes yeah.

227
00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.260
I babysit him a lot.
