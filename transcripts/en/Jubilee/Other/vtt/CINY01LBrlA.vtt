00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.110
<v 0>Have you ever had anyone be attracted to you just because you have the disease</v>

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.170
or is that all made up internet forums still? I mean,

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.580
I haven't experienced that at all.

4
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:11.810
<v 1>Some topics are hard,</v>

5
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.230
either the subjects are going accessible. HIV does not make people dangerous.

6
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.780
People are uncomfortable discussing them. So we found those subjects in person,

7
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.830
rented a space in Los Angeles and invited our audience and strangers to come in

8
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.050
and pass anything.

9
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.830
<v 0>My name is Ray Ferazi.</v>

10
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.880
I have HIV and I'm here to answer any questions that anyone might have about it,

11
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:38.773
HIV.

12
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.040
Hello? Hi. How are you? I'm good. How are you?

13
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.480
What was your first reaction when you, when you were first diagnosed? You know,

14
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.650
in movies when like it's a really like intense moment and suddenly, like,

15
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.970
it just becomes like tunnel vision and everything kind of like backs away.

16
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.230
I was in the doctor's office,

17
00:01:00.231 --> 00:01:04.250
staring at my doctor and she just like drifted off a hundred feet away and it

18
00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:08.360
was very like earth shattering for me just because I didn't know a lot about

19
00:01:08.361 --> 00:01:12.050
HIV. And I thought I was going to be dead in like two or three years old.

20
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.910
Are you when you found out it was on my 27th birthday, I'm 34.

21
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.350
<v 1>Any type of illness? Um, since being here.</v>

22
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.640
<v 0>Be positive. So when I was diagnosed, I actually was diagnosed with AIDS.</v>

23
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.650
So I was really, um, I was sick. My lymph nodes were swollen.

24
00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:32.690
I had rashes that were just popping up.

25
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.770
I was getting sick all the time with [inaudible] and so I was trying to get to a

26
00:01:36.771 --> 00:01:38.540
doctor, but I didn't have health insurance.

27
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.710
Cause it sucks here and clear that it was important for me to stay on

28
00:01:42.711 --> 00:01:47.420
antibiotics and medicine and to not like put myself in a

29
00:01:47.421 --> 00:01:49.580
situation where I might get a cold or flu,

30
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.070
cause then I could end up in the hospital and possibly die.

31
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.520
Do you know the person who did give you HIV?

32
00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.080
So I don't know exactly for sure.

33
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.400
I could have been infected with HIV from someone that I wasn't using protection

34
00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:08.270
with. Uh, I did test negative after, but I tested so soon.

35
00:02:08.271 --> 00:02:12.560
I wonder if it could have been in that window period where it doesn't show up or

36
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.800
it could have been from the person that I was in a three-and-a-half year

37
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.630
committed, monogamous relationship with who I later found out was cheating.

38
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.180
Oh. So I I'll never,

39
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.710
I'll never know who was the first person you told when you found out you were

40
00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:32.540
HIV positive and how did they react? The first person I told was my mom.

41
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.230
I called her from the doctor's office, sobbing, crying,

42
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.990
and um,

43
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.490
you know, she was,

44
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.930
she was worried of course and upset and um,

45
00:02:47.931 --> 00:02:51.140
and it wasn't coming from like a mean judgemental place. She was just, you know,

46
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.280
mother's fears ever since I came out as gay,

47
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.080
when I was 18,

48
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.040
that was a running fear in the back of her mind that I was going to get AIDS and

49
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:02.560
die. And I think there was jail somewhere in there for some reason.

50
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:06.430
I don't know where she got that connection from, but yeah. Yeah. She was like,

51
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.911
I'm gay.

52
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:10.750
So now you're going to end up in jail and AIDS and die as time went on and she

53
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:12.340
learned more about it and I learned more about it.

54
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.930
Then she realized that I'm going to be okay.

55
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:18.190
And that's kind of when she relaxed and she supports me and you didn't go to

56
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:20.440
jail and I, didn't not yet.

57
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.430
<v 3>As a healthcare professional, I come in contact with, you know,</v>

58
00:03:26.431 --> 00:03:28.830
a lot of people with communicable diseases. Uh,

59
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.090
is there anything I could do to make your life a bit easier when we do meet?

60
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.610
<v 0>Um, wow. I remember the first few times I went to go see a doctor,</v>

61
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.470
the fact that a doctor would shake my hand without putting, sorry,

62
00:03:43.471 --> 00:03:45.060
I'm getting emotional. Um,

63
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.010
without putting a glove on was like really impactful for me in the very

64
00:03:50.011 --> 00:03:52.560
beginning. I think that's a big deal.

65
00:03:52.561 --> 00:03:56.220
Just treating people like they're human and that it's not like an issue.

66
00:03:56.221 --> 00:03:57.120
It's not a thing.

67
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.540
You're just another person with something that they're coming to see a

68
00:04:00.541 --> 00:04:02.370
professional to get treated for. You know what I mean?

69
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.900
What is it like to like date now? It was tricky at first because I'm like,

70
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.360
do I put the status on the app that I'm using or the website or do

71
00:04:12.361 --> 00:04:13.350
I tell them later?

72
00:04:13.351 --> 00:04:17.730
And I decided not to put it on the apps and on my profile,

73
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.480
just because people are so quick to judge.

74
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.100
So I like to wait until there's like a face to face interaction with somebody

75
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.660
and then they can kind of get an idea of my energy and my vibe and like,

76
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.000
see that I'm like a normal human being and I'm quite the catch to in

77
00:04:36.001 --> 00:04:40.560
the U S the CDC agreed that if you're undetectable, do you know what that means?

78
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.710
So if you're taking your medicine for long enough,

79
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.790
it basically stops the virus in its tracks and it stops replicating.

80
00:04:47.791 --> 00:04:49.920
And it's not doing anything in your body. It's like hibernating.

81
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.230
When you're at that place, it's called undetectable.

82
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.350
And when that's the case for six months or longer,

83
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.980
then you can't give it to anybody. So, and I've been undetectable for years.

84
00:04:58.981 --> 00:05:02.580
So I know that I can't give it to people. Um,

85
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.590
but sometimes it's like a psychological hurdle for someone else to get it.

86
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.960
<v 2>Past. So this is sort of phrased weird, but like how much is this a part of you?</v>

87
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.810
It's definitely a part of you. It's not all of who you are. So like,

88
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.210
can you speak anything about that?

89
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.970
<v 0>I love that question. I agree with you a hundred percent.</v>

90
00:05:17.971 --> 00:05:20.730
It's just a small part of who I am,

91
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.900
but at the same time had this like really, really strong sense of purpose.

92
00:05:24.901 --> 00:05:28.680
I know that there's so much stigma and misinformation and there's not enough

93
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.400
visibility out there. And that was like the primary reason why I was like,

94
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.880
I need to start being a voice for it and starting to talk about it on social

95
00:05:35.881 --> 00:05:39.900
media and show the people, Hey, look, someone my age, who's normal and healthy.

96
00:05:39.901 --> 00:05:44.210
And like living his life has HIV and it's it's okay.

97
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.790
<v 2>Have you been discriminated against for having HIV?</v>

98
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.830
<v 0>Totally. Yeah.</v>

99
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.810
I had a barber that I was going was seeing regularly last year, actually.

100
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.210
And the last time that I saw him, I told him that I had HIV.

101
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.260
I did advocacy work ever since that day forward,

102
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:03.140
he wouldn't respond to any of my texts. Any of my calls I'd call the shop.

103
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.003
He'd be there.

104
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.160
Wouldn't call me back and wouldn't tell me why or anything either.

105
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:10.280
So it was really hard for me because I didn't know, you know,

106
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.070
why the sudden silence and I, after a month and a half,

107
00:06:13.071 --> 00:06:16.130
I kind of just figured out it's because of that. And I had to find a new barber.

108
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.880
We need to erase the image that we created in the eighties and the early

109
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:22.730
nineties of what HIV is no longer applies. It's like,

110
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:25.220
it's almost like it's a completely different virus now.

111
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.040
<v 3>Never had anyone be attracted to you just because you have the disease or is</v>

112
00:06:30.041 --> 00:06:31.590
that all made up internet for.

113
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.360
<v 0>I mean, I definitely happens.</v>

114
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.560
There are people I know they're called bug chasers and they're literally look

115
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.340
for people who have HIV. I haven't experienced that at all. Okay. Yeah.

116
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.690
Has there been anything good? That's come out of being a positive.

117
00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.060
It's funny because before I was diagnosed,

118
00:06:49.061 --> 00:06:53.320
I had never bench pressed or dead lifted or squatted before.

119
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.150
And that's like the Holy Trinity of working out.

120
00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.880
And now I'm doing my first pro men's physique bodybuilding competition.

121
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.420
So that was like a big thing for me to kind of like,

122
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.540
it was like a physical manifestation of me taking back my health.

123
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.840
And I don't know. I just, I just, I feel like I'm the happiest I've ever been,

124
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.823
to be honest.

125
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.380
<v 2>Did testing positive reevaluate. How you think about that?</v>

126
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.800
<v 0>It reevaluated how I think about life.</v>

127
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.680
Cause at first I thought I was going to be dead in three years.

128
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:25.360
It made me think about like how on a daily basis am I living

129
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.240
in my fulfilled? Am I doing what's important? What matters?

130
00:07:28.241 --> 00:07:29.710
You know what I mean? When,

131
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:34.210
when I was faced with what I thought was impending death,

132
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.790
I kind of had to ask myself all those questions.

133
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:38.830
<v 2>Well, I'm glad that you're here. Yeah.</v>

134
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.880
It's not your they're not gone in three years and that he can live a fulfilled

135
00:07:42.881 --> 00:07:47.500
life until you can die of old age. Exactly. Right. Very nice to talk to you.

136
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:48.933
Thank you.

137
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.830
<v 3>Thank you, man. I really do appreciate it, brother.</v>

138
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.140
It was lovely talking to you. Yeah, you too.

139
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:53.920
<v 4>Yes.</v>
