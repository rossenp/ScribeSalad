00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.571

5
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.960
Manscaped and I think it's pretty appropriate because the new wee

6
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.270
Wacker is like magic.

7
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.280
It's basically like a magic wand that you put up your nose and then like all

8
00:00:19.281 --> 00:00:22.070
your nose hair managed because it is that powerful.

9
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.880
You can get it as part and the new performance package,

manscaped that.

13
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.100
<v 0>Thank you to manscape for keeping our pubes trimmed and nose free of weeds.</v>

14
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.410
20 episodes, happy Halloween,

15
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.160
only person. Who's going to be entertained by that though. What was your,

16
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.600
it was a two-part.

17
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.320
<v 2>Yo, no way, Bonnie. That's exactly the card. I hope.</v>

18
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.480
<v 1>I would say the two.</v>

19
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.020
<v 0>We brought together seven magicians.</v>

20
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.120
<v 2>I'm a magician. I'm a magician. I am a magician and I'm a magician.</v>

21
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.010
I'm a magician. Hollywood's favorite.

22
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.950
<v 0>I am a magician.</v>

23
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.250
One is a liar. If the group discovers who the liar is, they'll win a cash prize.

24
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.930
If the liar survives, they win the cash prize. This is odd man out.

25
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.570
<v 2>You have much of a game plan at all. You're a real performing magician.</v>

26
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.450
There's things that just experiences that you just would have to have for

27
00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:34.130
yourself. So there's no way you could fake it.

28
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.670
I think the person who was not a magician, it's probably going to say the most

29
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.950
[inaudible] I'm a Spanish, but I am based in London.

30
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.660
I don't know if they're going to think I'm the mom,

31
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.370
just because the fact that I'm a girl,

32
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.780
I'm just excited to see these other magicians and talk about magic.

33
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.630
This is what I do every single day. So it shouldn't be a lot of fun.

34
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.010
<v 0>This is our trick round.</v>

35
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.240
Everyone will get three minutes to perform a trick for the group.

36
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.830
Let's begin with member one.

37
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.910
<v 2>First off I'm magic. What's up. Let's try something here. Um, I got a bunch of,</v>

38
00:02:07.911 --> 00:02:10.940
a bunch of different random cards. Now these are all Halloween themes.

39
00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:15.050
We've got things like candy, go score. Mummy, pumpkin, clown, goblin,

40
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.440
gravestone. Just to name some. Um, now you can have any one of these.

41
00:02:18.441 --> 00:02:21.830
I want it to be a completely fair choice. So whichever one that you want, uh,

42
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.720
I'm going to go through and you can name one. Whichever one.

43
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.840
<v 1>It seems like it already, just by the performance.</v>

44
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.700
<v 2>You want to go with skull and see, where was that?</v>

45
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:29.690
I'm going to give you one chance.

46
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.550
Do you want to change your mind or do you want to keep it skull?

47
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.690
You like knows how to do.

48
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.000
<v 0>Like video magic. Keep it skull. You want.</v>

49
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.310
<v 2>To keep it? Okay. Interesting. I'm going to leave it right here. Uh,</v>

50
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.040
hopefully we can see that the entire time. Now look, I'm going to try something.

51
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.410
Um, you could have had anyone that was completely fair.

52
00:02:42.411 --> 00:02:44.060
I'm going to show you that the backs of these ones,

53
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.100
all of these cars are completely blank on the back of them. But, uh,

54
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.830
but last night I had a vision. Okay. I had a vision. In fact,

55
00:02:51.831 --> 00:02:54.950
I was so confident that you're going to keep it skull,

56
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.950
that I actually took a marker and I wrote a big black X on back of one

57
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:03.060
card. I love it.

58
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.950
And that is your selection skull, right? Yeah. I love that's my trick.

59
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.110
I almost thought I almost thought goblin.

60
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.760
I know you could have changed your mind,

61
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.540
but moving it out of it and not have an awkward number two.

62
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.550
<v 0>How you doing? Okay. It's same.</v>

63
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.260
I was thinking to do because a lot of people aren't doing cut tricks,

64
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.210
but I mean, it's pretty cool, right? Just a little bit with the iPhone.

65
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.970
Okay. Now let's, let's say, um, a little bit with a coin. Let me say,

66
00:03:32.971 --> 00:03:34.890
let me show you something cool. All right.

67
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.460
So she's got like magic props.

68
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.140
The guest magicians knows the rising card, but this is,

69
00:03:43.141 --> 00:03:47.010
I call it the rising cone, because watch, when I shake my hand,

70
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.260
you'll see how, Oh, that's really good.

71
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.000
I watch the next one. I like,

72
00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.860
even if I take a little bit more slowly to shams all the way to the top,

73
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.350
bam. Right?

74
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.810
<v 2>That was dope. I get some, I get some confetti. Let's go. Number three.</v>

75
00:04:09.811 --> 00:04:10.860
Let's go to Ali.

76
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.520
<v 0>Hi. So I'm going to show you this magic trick and you see that all the courage</v>

77
00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:16.860
addiction. Oh, look at that spread. He's legit.

78
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.700
So what I'm going to try to do is I want to actually try to find the four ACEs.

79
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:25.140
The first one, if I give it a cut and I give it two more cuts,

80
00:04:25.141 --> 00:04:29.670
I think the first one happens to be Friday six from the top so I can try to get

81
00:04:29.671 --> 00:04:33.540
it right. The second one,

82
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.160
I think probably it's only five from the top. So we'll try and do it.

83
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.690
I'll try and do something a little different.

84
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.820
I just try and check the deck happened to pop up as the next day

85
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.580
I get the deck voted kit out. This is so good. Another cut.

86
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.300
I should be able to find the next day.

87
00:04:54.301 --> 00:04:58.050
So can you see that the deck of chef was here? Right? I'll get that one fat bowl

88
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.420
and I'll take the deck. And one in 52 chance.

89
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.900
I'll use my phone just to pull at one time. That happened to be the last days.

90
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.550
<v 2>Okay. Awesome. Thank you. Number three.</v>

91
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.040
I'm glad I don't have to follow up that kid.

92
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.590
The future of magic is in good hands.

93
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.070
I'm going to switch it up for the rest of the order. What student numbers? Six.

94
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.390
<v 3>Um, okay, so we've got a deck of cards, um, and I just want you to free select,</v>

95
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.970
to say stop whenever. Right? So, um,

96
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.210
I'm looking away, right? We're going to pick two cards.

97
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.980
Here's this and then this card as well. Okay.

98
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.150
You see this? Yeah. Okay. So, um,

99
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.290
you've got this two cards in your head. I'm going to try to remember, uh,

100
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.120
figure out what they are. So, um, bold move.

101
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.030
Okay. All right. Was one of

102
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.000
the ACE of spades. It was. Okay.

103
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.910
So we're going to find the other card. I know you're probably not that, that,

104
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.280
uh, amazed because this is zoom and everything and nothing's amusing over zoom,

105
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.610
but, uh, we're going to try to do this. So if you can see,

106
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.090
I'm drawing it to be like 3d kind of thing. Right.

107
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.630
And so it looks like a 3d card box. Right. And you'll see,

108
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:23.210
it's kind of cool because if I take this card box, right.

109
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.490
And I just kind of shake it like this, it looks as though

110
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.390
out of the card box and, uh,

111
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.950
that is the four diamonds. Okay, cool. Yeah.

112
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.050
All right. Number six. Had a great trick.

113
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.620
<v 4>Oh, for that either. Let's go. Number five.</v>

114
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.900
<v 2>Am I allowed to say my name? I get paranoid. Yes. Yeah. You can figure it out.</v>

115
00:06:51.901 --> 00:06:56.620
Okay. Hi. Okay. I'm Zach mirrors. I would like to show you something, Bonnie,

116
00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.210
uh, in theater class,

117
00:06:58.211 --> 00:07:02.590
have you seen the illusion where someone takes a

118
00:07:02.591 --> 00:07:07.270
sword and they put it through a person's body and on this way it looks

119
00:07:07.271 --> 00:07:11.050
like, you know, but this way it isn't seems legit.

120
00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.180
I want to try something. All right. I've got this, um,

121
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:21.190
a knife right over here. I know danger. And I've got a,

122
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.890
uh, I've got a deck of cards. So check it out.

123
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.490
The knife goes all the way through the deck of cards, just like so,

124
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.900
but what's interesting is, is he stabbing a really nice deck by let go.

125
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.320
It's kind of still there, but if I show you,

126
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:40.300
it actually is all the way through the deck of cards. Pretty interesting.

127
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.610
But there are no cards inside at all. Let's see if I take this out.

128
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:52.000
Can I show you what's inside? It is a solid block.

129
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:57.280
I know that this killer half-inch piece,

130
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:05.560
Steve.

131
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.600
<v 3>Kind of gutsy for him to do a trick like that.</v>

132
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:12.580
<v 4>Yes. Where did he go?</v>

133
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.940
He's a magician that guys, he trusts me. Number seven.

134
00:08:18.941 --> 00:08:22.210
Are you ready? My name is Yvonne. I'm going to show you something really cool.

135
00:08:22.211 --> 00:08:25.750
Bonnie, have you ever had your mind read before? I don't think so. All right.

136
00:08:25.751 --> 00:08:27.670
Great. This is kind of like that, but a little bit different.

137
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:31.720
I used to do Rubik's cubes growing up as a kid. And once I became a magician,

138
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.800
it actually became a lot easier to solve the Rubik's cube,

139
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:39.580
but I'm going to try something with you, right through zoom.

140
00:08:39.581 --> 00:08:42.520
Are you ready for that? I have another cue here.

141
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.370
They say there are six sides to the cube.

142
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:50.320
I'm going to ask you to name the side, front back left. Right?

143
00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:54.700
Top bottom. And add you name a side. I will turn that side. Front back,

144
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.990
left top bottom. It is up to you. Go, go for it.

145
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:03.750
You'll go right bottom, bottom. Let's go. Keep going.

146
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:07.020
Keep going a couple more top, uh, top. Here we go.

147
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.850
Top keeping going up left front three more,

148
00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:16.080
three more back. That would be back. Two more,

149
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:20.070
two more left. That would be left. And one more,

150
00:09:20.071 --> 00:09:24.960
one more bottom and bottom. Now you have no idea what you just did here,

151
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:28.710
but in a way you actually solved this release. Cute.

152
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.450
Let me show you. You'll notice. There's a bag right here inside this bag.

153
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:38.880
There is actually another cue, but I want you to look closely.

154
00:09:38.881 --> 00:09:40.950
I want you to see this. Can you see that?

155
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.930
That's actually a perfect match right there now just on one side,

156
00:09:45.931 --> 00:09:49.740
but check it out. That is two sides. A perfect match. Not just two sides.

157
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.890
That would be three sides of perfect match. That would be four.

158
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.460
So every single side, five sides, six sides of the cube.

159
00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.600
Perfect. A person that is, that is fantastic.

160
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.950
<v 1>Grooves tubes are really popular right now. Number seven is also a magician.</v>

161
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.210
<v 2>All right. And last but not least number four.</v>

162
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:16.850
<v 1>My name is Jeff Black. Jeff Black sounds like a magician.</v>

163
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:20.030
And today I brought a deck of cards, but this one's a little bit strange.

164
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.330
It's actually a blank deck of cards. You ever seen a blank deck of cards,

165
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:26.000
Bonnie. Okay. First time for everything.

166
00:10:26.001 --> 00:10:27.470
We're going to try and do magic with this,

167
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.590
but first I want you to think of any card. Don't even say it.

168
00:10:30.591 --> 00:10:33.740
Just think of it in your mind. Do you have one? Yeah. Okay.

169
00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.970
So I'm going to reach through the camera right into your mind.

170
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:41.990
And I'm going to pull out the one card that you're thinking of.

171
00:10:41.991 --> 00:10:46.370
And I think this is a great choice. I think in fact, I'm going to commit,

172
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:51.290
this is the card right here. I would like this to stay in the frame.

173
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.840
Okay. Um, so for the first time I'm committed,

174
00:10:53.841 --> 00:10:55.730
would you go ahead and just say it out loud? What was your card?

175
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.840
Here's a two-part yo, no way, Bonnie.

176
00:10:59.841 --> 00:11:04.580
That's exactly the card I hoped you would say now I don't want to brag,

177
00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:09.110
but this really is the two of hearts.

178
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.430
And that's the challenge of a blank deck. Obviously,

179
00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.290
if it was printed out would have been it. But thank you for humoring me.

180
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:17.540
In fact, let's use your magic to overcome that challenge.

181
00:11:17.541 --> 00:11:20.300
So if you had a magic word, what would it be? If it could be anything,

182
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.240
what would it be? Sparkle. Sparkle. Okay.

183
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.640
We're going to do this with one hand. Okay.

184
00:11:25.641 --> 00:11:29.510
Can you still see the blank card if I hold it like one, two,

185
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:30.980
three sparkle

186
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:37.190
and it prints one random card. Now of course, I know that isn't your card,

187
00:11:37.191 --> 00:11:40.970
but you did more than that. Bonnie, you printed two cards. Oh,

188
00:11:40.971 --> 00:11:42.020
you didn't stop there though.

189
00:11:42.021 --> 00:11:46.760
You printed every single card in the

190
00:11:46.761 --> 00:11:49.610
deck. Ooh. In fact,

191
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:53.950
I know it's already very impressive. Right. But the best isn't that?

192
00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:56.290
Not that you've printed every card in my hand, but honestly,

193
00:11:56.291 --> 00:11:57.670
the best part is you printed the one.

194
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.110
I wasn't even touching the one that you merely thought of.

195
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.540
The two of.

196
00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:10.830
<v 2>Dude. Yes. It's so good. I love that.</v>

197
00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.870
I think I might get kicked out because everybody else did really good.

198
00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.630
And especially doing it virtual. Let me say that was fantasy.

199
00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.750
<v 0>I mean, I'm just barely safe that I did my truck. Right?</v>

200
00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:23.070
Cause it was pretty difficult.

201
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:24.180
<v 1>The youngest nutrition,</v>

202
00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:27.600
some of the best handling and presentation I've seen with someone his age. So.

203
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:31.380
<v 0>Pieces of car flicks and slight of hand things that take a lot of things.</v>

204
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:35.010
<v 2>The ones who did the arm trick seemed a bit more nervous than a lot of the other</v>

205
00:12:35.011 --> 00:12:37.200
people, which is sign number one to me,

206
00:12:37.201 --> 00:12:40.260
which you might not be a magician because I forget his name. I'm sorry.

207
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:41.850
I'm terrible with names, but.

208
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:47.160
<v 1>The arm guy over one was a great performer. I didn't sense any nerves,</v>

209
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.210
but this trick in my opinion was easiest to perform. Even if he's strict,

210
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.800
he was very great. If.

211
00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.760
<v 0>I'm going to go to number six, I am going to vote for the short guy,</v>

212
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.890
the guy that shored the knife through the cut. I can't remember, sir. I am like,

213
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.140
I have bad memory. I'm pretty suspicious of him.

214
00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:05.430
Cause he could just pull that off.

215
00:13:05.431 --> 00:13:10.170
After about a minute of handling what he had voting for number six,

216
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.470
it seemed like they had a lot of nerves around performing that trick as if it

217
00:13:13.471 --> 00:13:14.304
was brand new.

218
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.400
<v 1>I'm going to vote for knife guy. That's the only trick that's like.</v>

219
00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:20.850
Doesn't use carts and isn't immediately obvious what his skill level is.

220
00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.670
<v 2>I don't know. They're I think they're all magicians,</v>

221
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.600
but I have to vote for someone. The guy that did the arm thing.

222
00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:32.610
<v 0>The votes are in the person eliminated this round</v>

223
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.850
is number six.

224
00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:39.630
Thank you. Number six.

225
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.670
<v 1>Doing it over. Zoom is pretty tough. It was in person.</v>

226
00:13:44.671 --> 00:13:46.530
I think I would have stood a pretty good chance.

227
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:50.490
I should have just had like a deck of cards, like stacked up behind me.

228
00:13:50.491 --> 00:13:53.430
Like who does that? You know what I mean? Like, look at this. Look at,

229
00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:56.550
look at this, look at this. You know, I should have put this up there.

230
00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.073
We'll look at it.

231
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:04.020
<v 2>What's up guys. This is so fun. Nice performance. Hey, Hey</v>

232
00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.880
Ali. You're amazing. You're so good buddy.

233
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.670
Never seen that guys. Where are you based? I'm from Dallas, Texas.

234
00:14:14.671 --> 00:14:17.700
So I say y'all a lot. So go Cowboys, Philadelphia,

235
00:14:17.701 --> 00:14:22.680
PA homie rays on the playgrounds where I spend most of my days. Oh LA. Oh,

236
00:14:22.681 --> 00:14:25.110
right near, um, the what's that place in LA where they do that.

237
00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:28.470
<v 0>You went to the magic.</v>

238
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:30.690
<v 2>Who to you see? Who is your favorite magician there?</v>

239
00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:32.460
<v 0>David Regal like was on.</v>

240
00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:37.950
<v 2>Did he do this trick right here? Now he invented like, Whoa,</v>

241
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.900
we're still up. We're still on. YouTube is YouTube. No, no, no. Uh,

242
00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.990
no methods or the technical. I get nervous about that.

243
00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:51.000
How many years have you guys done magic for the team? Yeah. Eight.

244
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.840
I mean, whenever I saw that Blaine special when I was a kid.

245
00:14:53.841 --> 00:14:55.540
So that was the one for me too.

246
00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:01.810
<v 0>Like an hour now, a year and a half. Probably a year and a half.</v>

247
00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.580
<v 1>You're insane for a year and a half. Number three.</v>

248
00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.790
<v 2>Hey Ali. Okay buddy. You remember me? Okay.</v>

249
00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.580
When you grow older and then if you need someone to work for you,

250
00:15:09.581 --> 00:15:13.750
you let me absolutely. I know you've got an amazing start conventions.

251
00:15:13.751 --> 00:15:18.370
You guys have been to magic, magic live. I have not. First time. Last year.

252
00:15:18.371 --> 00:15:19.204
It was amazing.

253
00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:23.290
<v 0>From Europe is black bull. It's expensive to go all the way to.</v>

254
00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:26.380
<v 2>Do. I want to go to a black hole. Yeah. I want to go to Blackpool as well.</v>

255
00:15:26.381 --> 00:15:28.530
That's one, that's one of my list. I've been the magic Fest.

256
00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:31.600
<v 1>Number one. Who's your favorite magician or what's your favorite magic book?</v>

257
00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.690
<v 2>Um, my favorite magician is I got to give it to David Blaine. I know.</v>

258
00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:38.080
It's kind of like, like everybody's a lot of people's favorite magician,

259
00:15:38.081 --> 00:15:38.831
but yeah, David blades,

260
00:15:38.831 --> 00:15:43.430
my favorite magician favorite magic book would be probably 13, 13.

261
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.480
I'm pretty in the new 13 steps. Steps to, yeah.

262
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:49.900
Mentalism is probably my favorite classic. Why would they be blamed?

263
00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:54.910
I like David Blaine because I feel like he really brought attention to,

264
00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.210
uh, to the, to the whole street magic thing. And I, and he,

265
00:15:58.211 --> 00:16:02.140
he was a really one who went out and recorded it and had that special history,

266
00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:02.651
super special.

267
00:16:02.651 --> 00:16:06.130
And I think that was probably what inspired me to kind of go do something.

268
00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:07.870
<v 0>Okay. We have five seconds.</v>

269
00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:13.090
<v 2>Thanks Ali. Sorry man. Yes. Kind of singled me out and was like, Hey,</v>

270
00:16:13.091 --> 00:16:15.850
what's your favorite magic book? And I was like, okay.

271
00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:20.800
I love talking about magic. I love me. I've never met these. Medallia's awesome.

272
00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.480
I really like Ali a lot.

273
00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:27.550
<v 0>I think we got rid of them all. We'll have to get rid of someone. Yeah. So yes.</v>

274
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.850
I'll say number one.

275
00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.750
<v 2>Yeah. My vote is going to be number two. I'm sorry. Number two. I,</v>

276
00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:37.510
no, wait. That's not right.

277
00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.570
<v 1>Number one. His favorite magician is David Blaine.</v>

278
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:44.470
That is a totally legitimate choice to have for a favorite magician.

279
00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:46.570
It's just rather pub.

280
00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.510
<v 0>I told you at the beginning, no one famous magician.</v>

281
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.510
The magician knew just like just the most popular magician.

282
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.600
Everyone has their own unique one. I think there's something up with him.

283
00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:58.870
<v 2>I'm going to dude, Jeff Black, just because I have to vote,</v>

284
00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:02.830
but I still think he's a magician, but like his math mustache too.

285
00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.070
But number one, smelling kind of mold, mold patrol.

286
00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.970
I definitely feel like I'm about to get voted out for some reason.

287
00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.250
<v 0>The person eliminated this round is</v>

288
00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:20.170
number one. Sorry. Number one,

289
00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.460
guys. That hurt.

290
00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:26.650
<v 2>Nah, it's all good.</v>

291
00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.680
I should have came in with a more powerful trick to kind of show off, you know,

292
00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:33.790
my, my card skills and number two saying David Blaine was my favorite magician.

293
00:17:33.791 --> 00:17:37.540
Because even though that is true, David blades, the most well-known magician,

294
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.200
I could see why they would think that I am not a magician because that's my

295
00:17:41.201 --> 00:17:42.460
answer. As weird as that is.

296
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.090
<v 0>Up. If you wish to continue the game or thumb down,</v>

297
00:17:46.091 --> 00:17:50.880
if you think you caught them all and you went to end for the game three, two,

298
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.800
one go.

299
00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:53.773
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

300
00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:59.330
<v 0>All right. So majority rules.</v>

301
00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.830
If the light behind me turns green,

302
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:07.670
you guys have voted them all out and you have one.

303
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.210
If the light behind me turns red,

304
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:14.120
the mall is still in the game and you have lost.

305
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:28.700
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

306
00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:33.380
<v 0>Can I please have my Mo my fake magician raise his hand</v>

307
00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.360
one, two.

308
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:40.940
<v 2>Oh, it rough guys. I was watching,</v>

309
00:18:40.941 --> 00:18:43.910
I was watching the performances go and I'm like, Oh my God,

310
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:50.120
why did I pick a cartridge? Oh man. That is so fun.

311
00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.450
You did it so well. How long did you work on that for? Well, okay.

312
00:18:53.451 --> 00:18:57.080
So I have like some amateur magic background, but I don't,

313
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:58.550
I've never done it professionally.

314
00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:02.570
So I grew up super shy and magic was a way of kind of being able to walk up to

315
00:19:02.571 --> 00:19:06.590
random strangers and just show them something a moment. And the energy,

316
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:10.580
when I first saw magic, when I was a kid was kind of the reaction,

317
00:19:10.581 --> 00:19:15.350
the energy I wanted to have around me in my job or

318
00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:19.070
art forms. I used to think that I needed to put messages in my tricks.

319
00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.160
And I realized that just bringing out the inner child is enough.

320
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:24.200
It's just all about the audience.

321
00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:28.910
And it's made them forget about the real world for a little like five

322
00:19:28.911 --> 00:19:33.530
seconds. I'm just happy. No, that was awesome.

323
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.680
Number three. How old are you, dude? They just turned nine, like on Wednesday.

324
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:39.830
Oh, you're awesome, dude. You got a card flips and everything already.

325
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:43.970
Amazing birthday man. Once, uh, COVID is over.

326
00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:47.690
I met out reunion at black pool. Let's do it. Hey, we're all family.

327
00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:52.760
We're all family. Even number six. I will ask my mom. I will ask my mom.
