1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.960
<v 0>Do you choose love or money? Oh my goodness.</v>

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.733
<v 1>Um.</v>

3
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.670
<v 0>Finding love, especially during this time can be pretty tough.</v>

4
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.780
Not knowing someone's intentions is pretty scary. Right? So for today's episode,

5
00:00:26.781 --> 00:00:30.110
we asked Taylor to choose between love or money.

6
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.540
What do you think she'll choose? That's fine.

7
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.280
<v 1>Welcome.</v>

8
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.040
<v 0>Hello everybody. And hello to bachelorette. Number one. How are you feeling?</v>

9
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.550
You're feeling excited. You're feeling nervous.

10
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.590
<v 1>Very fine. Before I started seeing all the faces and now my heart is like.</v>

11
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.950
<v 0>I want to get to know you a little bit. Right?</v>

12
00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:54.320
And I'm sure all these guys want to get to know you too.

13
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.540
<v 1>Yeah. So I'm model part-time and then I'm also in grad school for psychology,</v>

14
00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:02.300
because I want to be a therapist. What's a way to your heart.

15
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.560
I'm really emotional.

16
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.300
So somebody who just has a lot of like emotional intelligence or is emotionally

17
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.370
tune, that's really attractive for Bella.

18
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.820
<v 0>Chance to stand out. I'm going to have you guys introduce yourselves,</v>

19
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.830
give us something interesting. That'll make you stand up.

20
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:19.850
Give us your elevator pitch

21
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.040
Advance, um, into per core, trying new things, traveling to new places at once,

22
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.720
bought a pick off of Craigslist. And I lost it in my dorm room over the radio.

23
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.200
And I don't always, if you want to go to a music festival, I'm all game.

24
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.770
If you want to rewatch Harry Potter again, I'm also all game.

25
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.060
[inaudible] like a serenade. You at your house, electric a lot.

26
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.970
I'm from England. And my fun fact is that I died in the past.

27
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.160
I died in the past. If you need someone to take your breath away on your man,

28
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.840
I'm a personal trainer. So if you ever want to get a workout in,

29
00:01:56.841 --> 00:01:59.420
we could do that. I'm living my lifelong dreams and meteorologists.

30
00:01:59.421 --> 00:02:02.210
So if you ever need to know, and there's a 30% chance started raining,

31
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.970
I mean to photography and modeling as well.

32
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:07.910
So hopefully we can get a shoot together. I love skateboarding.

33
00:02:07.911 --> 00:02:11.810
I love doing film photography as well. I enjoy dancing, going to the club.

34
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.480
Really liked the photography so I can definitely picture us together.

35
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.470
I'm British. I'm a creditor. Perfect. You don't want the real camera.

36
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.700
I happen to love therapist and models. So I'm the perfect guide for you.

37
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.970
I'm also a Scorpio. You mentioned your emotional Scorpios. The water's fine.

38
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.030
And we're known to be emotional. Plant-based cook, chill,

39
00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:31.940
laid back guy and a family oriented. I give a ride.

40
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.330
Most of the vehicles that either have wheels or slide.

41
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.610
So I'm a slide to your BMS. After this.

42
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.630
I hope a college degree is no requirement for you because I actually dropped out

43
00:02:41.631 --> 00:02:43.070
of college. Don't eliminate me.

44
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.280
<v 1>Well, I'm pretty cringy. I don't know if you can say already, but.</v>

45
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.030
<v 0>SoundCloud artists or whatever. I like to go camping. Uh,</v>

46
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.960
I'm into photography, um, instructor,

47
00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.220
constructor and actor stand up hiking. I cook a lot. I'm actually going to ask.

48
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.810
<v 2>You if you could close your eyes real quick and you can open that. And well,</v>

49
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:06.940
here I am. I'm the sign that you were looking for.

50
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.230
<v 1>That was really good.</v>

51
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.170
<v 0>Up until now. It was all fun and games. It was all laughter. However,</v>

52
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.910
I am going to put the responsibility on you of eliminating

53
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.290
down to 10 people right off the bat. Half of them have to go home.

54
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.250
<v 1>Um, I'm just going to list them. I don't even want to say why.</v>

55
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.060
Cause I'm so scared, but know that I love you. Okay. Number five.

56
00:03:39.061 --> 00:03:43.530
Number seven number. Where am I at? I don't know where I'm at.

57
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.410
Oh my God. Don't even look at me. Five, five more, five more

58
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:49.483
number,

59
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.910
number six.

60
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.540
<v 0>To the 10. They made her. Give yourself a Pat on the back. Give yourself a hand.</v>

61
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.050
<v 1>Oh my gosh. Certainly laugh is not cute.</v>

62
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.790
<v 0>If you can make her ugly cackle, you know, she likes you. Okay.</v>

63
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.380
So bachelorette number one,

64
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.330
I'm going to offer you a proposition I have with me a hundred dollars right now.

65
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.540
If you choose to take this $200, you can go home,

66
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.090
call it a day and relax by yourself. A nice meal.

67
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.470
Or you can continue on to the next round with these 10 lovely gentlemen.

68
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.980
So bachelorette number one. Do you choose?

69
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.100
<v 1>Where am I choosing this?</v>

70
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.680
<v 0>Well, no hesitation right off the bat. Alrighty.</v>

71
00:04:34.681 --> 00:04:37.980
Y'all we are moving on to stage number two.

72
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.770
Number two is the special skills slash talent portion.

73
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.420
So bachelorette number one.

74
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.850
What's the interesting fact there like a special skill that yeah.

75
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.810
<v 1>I like to lift the most I've ever squatted is 300 pounds.</v>

76
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.350
My gosh, I'm ready to get some lift.

77
00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.000
<v 0>Okay. Okay. Now love her toes. Yeah. Watch out Bella. Watch out.</v>

78
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.030
I'm going to give each of you 30 seconds to showcase the talent.

79
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.990
<v 1>Sorry. That would just, you know, do a self portrait.</v>

80
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.310
I don't know. It just took me three days where you mentioned you love lifting.

81
00:05:17.311 --> 00:05:20.340
So that's why I got my lifting belt with me. Ready?

82
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.050
Do you have like a YouTube channel and stuff like that?

83
00:05:31.051 --> 00:05:32.340
Where I cook and share with me.

84
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.120
<v 0>That cinnamon bun was a little too sensual and made me unbuttoned one,</v>

85
00:05:45.121 --> 00:05:45.954
one boat.

86
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.660
<v 2>And I made this grilled cheese like an hour ago. So it's kind of Lindsey,</v>

87
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.990
but I'm going to pull it just to see if the cheese those out. Okay.

88
00:05:54.991 --> 00:05:56.280
So no that's kind of awkward.

89
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.600
<v 0>Which one are you guys was the personal trainer. I'm calling them out.</v>

90
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.610
I'm the personal trainer. What you got? Show me.

91
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.520
Well more pushups than the personal trainer guy.

92
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.230
I love how competitive guys get. Oh, you do pushups or you do push push go

93
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.910

94
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.360
Time. We'll give you 43 for the benefit of doubt.

95
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.050
Impressive 18 with a hoodie on to number 12.

96
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.990
Are you up for the pushup challenge? I'm going to do something a little better.

97
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.850
So I have a hundred pound dumbbell right now. I could curl it. I could lift it.

98
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.710
You just crawled a hundred pounds. That's like.

99
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:18.970
<v 1>[Inaudible] [inaudible].</v>

100
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.880
<v 2>Well, number nine was moving his fingers. I can do something with my tongue</v>

101
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:29.110
also. Um, uh, 18 did pushups. Great. Um.

102
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.370
<v 0>Okay. All right, Bruce. Please</v>

103
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:37.713
clap your hands.

104
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.520
<v 2>You guys are very talented, but personally I don't have a special talent.</v>

105
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.210
I really don't. The only thing special is the way I would treat you.

106
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.640
<v 0>You just seem to have lines in your pocket. So hit bachelor, red,</v>

107
00:07:51.641 --> 00:07:53.800
number one with one of your finest lights.

108
00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:00.340
<v 2>I don't know what you would do here. I don't know what you're doing here. If ah,</v>

109
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.880
how does it go? I forgot how it goes. Okay. I got it. I got it. I got it.

110
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:07.330
What you're doing here. Okay. I don't understand what you're doing here.

111
00:08:07.331 --> 00:08:08.170
Who's the guardian Kevin.

112
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.690
<v 0>All right. So bachelor number one, instead of eliminating,</v>

113
00:08:16.691 --> 00:08:18.370
I want you to pick your top five.

114
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:24.370

115
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.250
I'm just comfortable with contestant. Number 11.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.030
I really like his charisma contested.

117
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:35.740
Number four was all the classes and stuff. I was like, Oh, snap, number 13.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.920
<v 0>Contested that moves on. Who is it going to be?</v>

<v 0>All right. So congratulations to the five of you. Let's give it up.</v>

121
00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.710
Bachelorette. Number one. Uh let's let's chat.

122
00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:04.940
I know I offered you like $200. I felt like that wasn't enough. Right?

123
00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.740
And these guys seem pretty great, but you know what? Offer sounds great. 300.

124
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:15.080
I mean it does sound kind of nice. You can take this 300, call it a day.

125
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:19.880
Go have some fun or we can continue on to the next stage with these five

126
00:09:19.881 --> 00:09:23.390
gentlemen. So do you choose love?

127
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:37.070

130
00:09:44.801 --> 00:09:46.700
I don't know. I don't know what you see in these guys.

131
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.310
All five of you will have a chance to do an activity that bachelor,

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:55.120
bachelorette number one enjoys of to her picking.

<v 1>And like I said, I'm really emotional.</v>

134
00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.820
I want to see how passionate you guys can get.

135
00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.250
So I want you to reenact like a scene.

136
00:10:01.251 --> 00:10:04.850
If somebody would like shoot you or like stab you. And like,

137
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.100
I want sort to like reenact, like the sub guy.

138
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.530
<v 0>That is so original. How would you die if you were the star of your own?</v>

139
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:18.523
<v 1>Y why?</v>

140
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:29.000
I have Oh, 650 stones. Yeah.

141
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:34.040
You think so, but I'm iron man. And then the golden builds up until the kids.

142
00:10:34.041 --> 00:10:36.260
I love them. I'll see you on the other side.

143
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:45.710
I'll have the rest of your money soon. Just put the gun down here.

144
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.270
I have a part of it. Now.

145
00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:56.120
<v 0>I'll give you a thing. Is that okay? Let's say you just ate a poisonous steak.</v>

146
00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:58.363
I like the flip.

147
00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:07.340

You cheated on me. My own brother

151
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:28.603
always love you forever.

152
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.400
<v 0>That was a long day for someone that just got shot into heart.</v>

153
00:11:37.401 --> 00:11:41.850
You had a monologue, right? Sure.

154
00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:45.380
Number one, we have to eliminate three people.

155
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:49.940
<v 1>Literally counting. Okay. I can do this.</v>

156
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.790
The first person and willing to eliminate

157
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:58.000
13. Oh my gosh. Okay.

158
00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.500
Number 12 said that I cheat on him with his brother.

159
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.270
<v 0>The acting got to use to real.</v>

160
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.863
<v 1>Do that.</v>

161
00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.850
<v 0>Contestant number four and number 11, give it up. Congrats guys.</v>

162
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:19.230
<v 1>Number one. I got it. I got some more money.</v>

163
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.290
<v 0>Clearly, right? For all the effort and time that you've been putting in.</v>

164
00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:23.993
<v 1>$500.</v>

165
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.310
<v 0>Number 11 is like, Oh shoot. You might want to take that girl. I don't know.</v>

166
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.510
He was, I think he would understand. Number four. Not so much.

167
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.590
Come on guys. She's emotion. You guys got to sit for her. You got to be like,

168
00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:41.940
no, I'm worth way more than the 500 baby girl. You either take this 500,

169
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:42.840
go travel somewhere.

170
00:12:42.841 --> 00:12:47.580
If it's safe or you move on and you pick a lucky

171
00:12:47.581 --> 00:12:51.030
guy, bachelorette, number one,

172
00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:52.800
do you choose love?

173
00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:57.923
<v 1>Um,</v>

174
00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:09.590
my integrity keeps telling me.

175
00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:15.210
<v 0>Love. Wow. I am. That's getting me emotional, emotional.</v>

176
00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:17.160
<v 1>Person. I mean that you really are.</v>

177
00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.740
<v 0>You really are. I love that. Okay.</v>

178
00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:21.773
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

179
00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:28.140
<v 0>So each of you guys will have a one-on-one time to talk to our lovely bachelor,</v>

180
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.020
right? And get to know each other on a more personal and deeper.

181
00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:32.663
<v 1>Basic.</v>

182
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.630
<v 3>How's it gone? Hi, isn't this weird?</v>

183
00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:41.820
<v 1>I know this is so weird. I'm so nervous.</v>

184
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:46.740
<v 4>First and foremost, I'm super excited. You're drop dead. Gorgeous.</v>

185
00:13:46.741 --> 00:13:49.380
I love you're a whole goat to your look.

186
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:55.110
<v 3>Um, I didn't think I'll make this far as far as keeping me</v>

187
00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:00.570
standing. So a little bit about myself. I'm Chinese. I'm from China.

188
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:04.920
Went to Brazil when I was five years old. I came to the us when I was 17.

189
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:08.700
I speak Portuguese, um, English and Mandarin. Where are you?

190
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.500
<v 1>I'm in Chino, California.</v>

191
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.370
Like 40 minutes away from where I'm at.

192
00:14:14.371 --> 00:14:16.050
Tell me a little bit for yourself right now.

193
00:14:16.051 --> 00:14:19.710
I'm doing a whole zoom universities tuition because of the pandemic I like to

194
00:14:19.711 --> 00:14:23.970
sing. Um, I'm passionate about modeling. I am religious. Um,

195
00:14:23.971 --> 00:14:25.800
I don't know if they're religious. Are you religious at all?

196
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.860
<v 3>What kind of religion? I'm Christian.</v>

197
00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:31.200
<v 1>And then I also consider myself spiritual.</v>

198
00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:34.650
<v 4>I was raised Catholic. I'm actually from a TJ, Mexico,</v>

199
00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.730
just kind of something that my parents raised me off as I was able to venture

200
00:14:38.731 --> 00:14:42.150
out for myself and see what kind of stuff is out there. And I, you know,

201
00:14:42.151 --> 00:14:43.530
I started going to a Christian Church.

202
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.960
So now religion has become a huge part of my life. You know?

203
00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.210
<v 1>Beautiful. No I'm Christian. So</v>

204
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:54.350
I would identify also a spiritual because I believe in like crystals and like

205
00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.550
meditation and all that.

206
00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:59.290
<v 4>That's something that I've kind of been trying to like venture out and learn</v>

207
00:14:59.291 --> 00:15:02.170
more about it. Cause sometimes just the stress for the world is this.

208
00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.790
<v 1>I mean, I'm happy to teach you. I'm learning too. So don't think.</v>

209
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:14.260
<v 0>You went from 20 guys and you narrow down to two.</v>

210
00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.890
<v 1>And he's gracious. I'm a sucker for a smile. They both have beautiful smiles.</v>

211
00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.740
<v 0>Oh they do. Oh, bachelor, number one.</v>

212
00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:23.740
This is the moment where you have to choose.

213
00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:29.920
<v 1>Um, religion is something that's super important to me.</v>

214
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:34.000
So I'm going to have to eliminate and tested them.

215
00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.080
It's all good. Thank you so much.

216
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:43.270
<v 0>Number 11. Why don't you look at that?</v>

217
00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.520
I can't believe this is what Jews are made of.

218
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.850
So congrats to you too. If only that were at the end, right?

219
00:15:51.851 --> 00:15:54.940
If only there was more, you know what I mean? Come on guys.

220
00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:00.940
I'm going to talk to each of you individually and I'm going to offer a

221
00:16:00.941 --> 00:16:03.130
proposition just to make things a little more complicated.

222
00:16:03.131 --> 00:16:04.420
I'm going to give you more choices.

223
00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:08.230
So I'm going to present you with three options so you can either choose love or

224
00:16:08.231 --> 00:16:12.580
money. If both of you choose love, then you get to split the 500,

225
00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.120
get two 50 each and go on a second date. It's a win-win

226
00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:21.340
however, if one of you chooses love, but one of you chooses money.

227
00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.750
The person that chooses money,

228
00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:26.500
cash it out all 500 and the other person goes home brokenhearted.

229
00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:32.050
But if both of you guys get greedy and try to choose money,

230
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:33.970
you guys both go home with nothing.

231
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:39.400
<v 4>She's carefully. Option three. Sounds like complete duty. Um, I dunno,</v>

232
00:16:39.401 --> 00:16:39.970
man.

233
00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:42.250
<v 0>We chose love every single round,</v>

234
00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:46.660
but go with what you think is best love or money. Is this, this,

235
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.070
this guy worth the love.

236
00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:52.270
<v 1>Honestly, for me, I just, I just, she chose money, huh?</v>

237
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:54.520
<v 0>Hey, we're about to find out.</v>

238
00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:57.003
<v 1>Hi guys.</v>

239
00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:58.483
<v 4>Hello?</v>

240
00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:03.970
<v 0>That was the most nervous. Hi, I've heard from both of y'all. All right,</v>

241
00:17:03.971 --> 00:17:08.380
everyone. Good? Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Loud and clear.

242
00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:10.480
Three, two.

243
00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:14.913
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

244
00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:23.170
<v 4>Uh, it was easy too easy of a question to ask me. I had the feeling.</v>

245
00:17:23.171 --> 00:17:26.390
I felt that connection. I was like, it's a no brainer, man. Love is,

246
00:17:26.391 --> 00:17:30.560
is the way to go. Love, heals all things. That's it.

247
00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:33.790
It was the only, it was the only reasonable choice period.

248
00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:38.350
<v 1>Drops mic. Oh my gosh. I literally, my cheeks hurt from smiling.</v>

249
00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:41.380
<v 4>I was like, man, they're going to offer me like a thousand dollars. If I.</v>

250
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.660
<v 0>Did what? That I've changed your answer. Hell.</v>

251
00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.790
<v 4>No, you could have said a million.</v>

252
00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.910
<v 0>Oh, a million. Okay. All right.</v>

253
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:53.550
<v 4>All right guys. Well, I've done my job. That's it for me.</v>

254
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:58.590
I'm a leave you two lovebirds and thank you bachelorette for choosing love.

255
00:17:58.591 --> 00:18:00.960
At the end of the day, over the moon with the outcome,

256
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:04.200
I was very interested in her. I was hoping she picked me from the start.

257
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:09.170
I wrote her with the, with, uh, my juggling skills. I think it's what.

258
00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.540
<v 1>Even if you would have chose money,</v>

259
00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:14.000
I think I would have still been happy with my decision.

260
00:18:14.001 --> 00:18:15.710
I just think love is a beautiful thing.

261
00:18:15.711 --> 00:18:19.420
And I know I sound super cliche and super cheesy, but keep trying,

262
00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:23.930
keep your heart open and know that living locally.
