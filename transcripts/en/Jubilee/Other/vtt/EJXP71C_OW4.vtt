So given that it's also [inaudible] and moisturizing.

I totally have to get that well, without further ado,

17
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.570
here's our episode on men gamers.

18
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.390
We brought together six professionals. I'm a pro gamer. I play Tekken seven.

19
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.870
I am a professional gamer. I am a pro gamer. I am a pro gamer.

20
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.410
I am a pro one is a liar.

21
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.770
If the group discovers who the liar is, they'll win a cash prize.

22
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.360
If the liar survives,

23
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.220
they win the cash prize with Mike's and camera's off and fake gamer

24
00:01:25.221 --> 00:01:28.070
aliases. Can they find the odd man out?

25
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.810
I am coming into this pretty confident that we're going to come out.

26
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.850
<v 1>My game plan going into this is I really don't have one.</v>

27
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.421
<v 0>Well,</v>

28
00:01:38.421 --> 00:01:42.320
I'm going to be confident about me being a gamer because I am just going to try

29
00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:44.210
to exude that confidence about it.

30
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.330
A lot of liars in the gaming industry throughout my career.

31
00:01:47.331 --> 00:01:49.250
So I'm going to be able to find them I'm the last.

32
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.350
<v 1>Person people would guess at them all. I'm like, yeah.</v>

33
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:52.190
<v 0>Dude,</v>

34
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.830
I feel kind of nervous that I'm just going to get voted out on the first round.

35
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.870
Hopefully you don't seem too sketchy to people.

36
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.020
I don't want to get eliminated at first. Dig it. Okay.

37
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.730
<v 1>I really hope that my what's popping gamers is going to attract too much</v>

38
00:02:04.731 --> 00:02:09.290
attention. I don't want to say the first thing probably going to be like,

39
00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:12.950
what do you guys play? And I play smash. Okay.

40
00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:15.710
Super smash brothers league of legends, both good proteins.

41
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.890
I'll tell type rocket league. Alright. Oh, smash.

42
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.270
<v 0>Okay. CS Valor. And we got rocket league.</v>

43
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.390
<v 1>Okay. This, this, this chick says that she plays Hearthstone.</v>

44
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.460
I used to be pro Hearthstone player.

45
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.930
So kind of have an idea of that scene. Sweet.

46
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.300
I, I mean, of course, you know,

47
00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:44.390
everybody's naming something that is in a fighting game. Of course.

48
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.530
<v 0>Credit saying that I'm from mainly gives me a lot of credit.</v>

49
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.460
<v 1>Uh, it's just nuts.</v>

50
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.720
It's like we trained the Himalayas 10,000 years and to be sports things,

51
00:02:56.721 --> 00:02:59.830
there's like common cities. I want to see what people maybe.

52
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.300
<v 2>Probably Montreal for DreamHack.</v>

53
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.780
<v 1>Even city. We there's only so, Oh wait.</v>

54
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:10.620
Oh, what favorite.

55
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.230
<v 2>City you've been to? Um.</v>

56
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.780
<v 1>Greenland's feel like</v>

57
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.540
this. I feel.

58
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.790
<v 2>Ah. I'm not really sure. Okay. The league of legends player,</v>

59
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.660
I'm the little suss of that because it's just so easy to say league of legends.

60
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.850
Oh my God. That round is so fast.

61
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.420
<v 1>Nobody mentioned a fighting game. I got too anxious.</v>

62
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.660
Although I was more thinking out loud than I was typing.

63
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.710
Hopefully that doesn't hurt me,

64
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.720
but I definitely did vote for J dizzle because less info given by Dave Bizzle.

65
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.910
I'm probably going to vote for banana just because I don't know who

66
00:03:53.911 --> 00:03:54.744
else to vote for.

67
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.020
<v 2>I wouldn't say it. Hey, are you into pro gaming?</v>

68
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.590
I'm going to vote for a lobster. I think lost watch. There's a little sauce.

69
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.400
Wow. I guess maybe I look kind of sauce. Gotta be banana,

70
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.350
but I gotta go with J bezel. Honestly, she was not talking much fudge, dude.

71
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.680
<v 1>I really hope that I feel like I was the most suspicious.</v>

72
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.130
I'm looking at this objectively and I feel like I was the most suspicious,

73
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.290
I guess Jay Bizzle. Why not?

74
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.420
The first person eliminated in round one is

75
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.990
J Bez. Gosh,

76
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.290
I made it through round one thing. My minute is rough. I'm curious to see why.

77
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.270
<v 2>Good luck charm.</v>

78
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.010
<v 1>I'm putting my ritual. Like what I do.</v>

79
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.393
<v 2>Um.</v>

80
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.930
<v 1>There's something really specific about the data protection. Seven</v>

81
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.153
technique.

82
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.800
<v 2>No fireballs magic is a super dope team</v>

83
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.943
back there.

84
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.570
Um, okay. Some kind of high level strategy that I got to talk about. I mean,

85
00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:01.700
I don't want to mention wave dashing because that's kind of obvious

86
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.593
aerial interrupts.

87
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.830
<v 0>I mean it's true. No, one's good at magic and the scope of the game. No,</v>

88
00:06:20.831 --> 00:06:25.150
one's actually good. On-site of Elron CLG. Oh. Oh, that's pretty.

89
00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:29.430
That's pretty crazy one CLG right now. Woof. Wow.

90
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.110
Wait, what does Larry play? Ghana.

91
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.960
<v 2>Back down, back for a second guys. Okay. So we're getting technical here.</v>

92
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.850
I'm on CLG right now. Maybe we know here.

93
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.850
<v 0>I think I know Greenland's herd. Is it hugs? Is it Hugo?</v>

94
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.070
I think I know what that person is.

95
00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.870
<v 2>I have been unsigned and Valor, but played for CLG.</v>

96
00:06:55.871 --> 00:06:59.710
When I played in CS currently playing as prospects in invalid.

97
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.890
What does that mean? Does that as prospects?

98
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.730
That's I don't know what that means. Okay. I think I know Greenland.

99
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.300
Yes. I'm safe. Okay. Did they have an idea of who this is? Okay.

100
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.110
Um, gaming outlets

101
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.380
or what

102
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.670
G-Force experience. Okay. You all one?

103
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:39.270
I don't know. I'm asking about price.

104
00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:44.050
I was in between late 2017 and most of the 2018 for me. All right.

105
00:07:44.051 --> 00:07:46.690
I'm a little sense of BRN. Um,

106
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.970
you like, okay. Bananas talking about liking combo decks.

107
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:56.263
Okay.

108
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:11.230
<v 0>Oh, this is so, Oh, I'm not voted out.</v>

109
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.550
Oh my God.

110
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.370
<v 2>I think I'm good. Actually. Do I have to vote for someone?</v>

111
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:20.740
<v 0>Honestly, green lantern is kind of sus I kind of got to go with Greenland.</v>

112
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.970
They did not really talk too much. Okay. Well I'm pretty sure BRN is,

113
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.060
which is good vibe banana. I'm going to say Apple cat,

114
00:08:28.061 --> 00:08:30.820
just because like their high level technique doesn't really seem so high level.

115
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.430
I'm gonna go with Larry. Larry, the lobster.

116
00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:38.290
<v 2>For B R N. I I don't care if I look stupid after this video, I am so sure.</v>

117
00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:39.303
It's BRN.

118
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:44.140
<v 0>So the result of Brown two was a five-way</v>

119
00:08:44.141 --> 00:08:47.440
split. Every single person got one boat.

120
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:53.590
<v 2>I called it before it happened. That means I got voted on.</v>

121
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:56.010
Are we.

122
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.030
<v 0>Supposed to do in this power?</v>

123
00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:16.843
<v 2>You have to take a look.</v>

124
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.200
<v 0>Yeah. I honestly don't know.</v>

125
00:09:30.201 --> 00:09:33.860
It is so difficult to tell what anybody is right now. It is such a fast round,

126
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.960
ah, fudge dude.

127
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:03.463
<v 2>[Inaudible]</v>

128
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.460
I'm going to start using this is man. I really can't tell. I play. What's good.

129
00:10:16.461 --> 00:10:21.440
That's literally the correct answer for a pro player. Kind of. Okay.

130
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:30.830
<v 0>What am I supposed to do? Is there more shade on me? I don't understand Larry.</v>

131
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:31.903
I like.

132
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.063
<v 2>13.</v>

133
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.350
<v 0>I forgot us a lot of details. BRN still not saying much</v>

134
00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.160
Ruined names. Some big name wins.

135
00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.820
I'm going to get them to start saying this big game. Big name wins.

136
00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:01.740
<v 2>Uh, alums, uh, uh,</v>

137
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.800
um, laughing duck.

138
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.780
Nobody going? Nobody said anything. Okay.

139
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:22.700
<v 0>I did not expect this to happen. I am helpless. And so unsure.</v>

140
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.090
I can't believe someone voted for me. I feel kind of bad going after Panetta.

141
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.720
Larry doesn't know anything about car games. And so,

142
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.390
and so that's why they're throwing shade on me. Like any specifics?

143
00:11:32.391 --> 00:11:35.060
What do you mean banana has been legit,

144
00:11:35.061 --> 00:11:39.560
like responding last to everything. I don't know. I gotta go banana.

145
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:41.990
I want them on my thing to be around because applicant is getting really

146
00:11:41.991 --> 00:11:45.860
specific. Gotta be banana. If it's not. I'm sorry, banana.

147
00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.770
If you're watching this video, I humbly apologize to you,

148
00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:58.530
Ty. Is

149
00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:06.330
it wasn't me? It wasn't me. I do think bird was way too vague.

150
00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:11.490
Oh man. I thought we had that. Larry. I thought we were good.

151
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.490
I, 100% believe the molds banana.

152
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.350
We're going to turn on Mike's.

153
00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:22.260
<v 1>And everybody will get to interact with each other via audio as they play.</v>

154
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.950
<v 3>Definitely biased towards the fighting game players. By the way.</v>

155
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.600
<v 0>No, I don't think so. Cause I'm playing on a keyboard.</v>

156
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.140
<v 3>Wait, did I just kill myself? Who am I?</v>

157
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.710
<v 0>And my game is so loud that I'm having trouble hearing, but um,</v>

158
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.650
turn your games on off. We could all just like stand still for a second.

159
00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.500
I want to win. Wait. No, but,

160
00:12:43.501 --> 00:12:48.000
but we could all stop for a second so you can turn your names on. Yeah,

161
00:12:48.001 --> 00:12:50.040
let's all. Let's all stop. We can be settled here.

162
00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:52.260
<v 3>I think I accidentally jumped off and killed myself.</v>

163
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:58.740
<v 0>Okay. So you do a tournament out in Bangkok, Thailand. What was the tournament?</v>

164
00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:03.660
Did you get your sound controlled freelancer? What? Oh,

165
00:13:03.661 --> 00:13:06.180
I'm asking, uh, what was the tournament called that you went to in Thailand?

166
00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:11.610
We were, we were waiting for you to, um, get your sound. I'm like, Oh no,

167
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.100
it's cool. I can hear it. It's fine. Yeah.

168
00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:17.550
<v 1>It wasn't that it was for the second world four finals and they had something</v>

169
00:13:17.551 --> 00:13:19.650
called the last chance off people who get it,

170
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.640
get the points to actually make it.

171
00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:26.460
So that's why I went there for the final two lashes qualifier.

172
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.980
And they ended up how'd you place it in?

173
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.430
I got 33rd in the last I bought by her last year.

174
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:34.860
<v 0>It was a class. Remember who you lost him?</v>

175
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:39.360
<v 1>Yes. His name is you and he's a thing way player from Japan. Okay.</v>

176
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.830
<v 0>All. Oh, um, Larry. Okay. How do I, how do we know that?</v>

177
00:13:43.831 --> 00:13:48.120
You're not like just an LCS coach and streamer as opposed to like a player?

178
00:13:48.121 --> 00:13:49.350
Like how can you distinct yourself?

179
00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.740
<v 3>Um, you know, honestly, I don't know.</v>

180
00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.530
And anyone could just be someone who's really knowledgeable in this scene. Well,

181
00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.710
I guess apparently not you guys since apparently, you know each other, but uh.

182
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.980
<v 0>Well, I, I only know, uh, um, banana,</v>

183
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:08.730
but Apple sounded real convincing to me, but Larry, I'm just wondering,

184
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.380
what was the last tournament you answered? Like what was it?

185
00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.710
<v 3>Uh, well, I'll see you us is more like based, right?</v>

186
00:14:13.711 --> 00:14:16.860
So you only qualify for tournaments if you do really well on the Susan, the last

187
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:23.400
four time TL and real championship, where are you in the last? Uh,

188
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.660
and funny. What was the last time you played it? Yeah, 2018. My last land.

189
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:32.820
<v 0>Dude, I haven't hit it like a gear stuff, stuff jumping around. Let me hit you.</v>

190
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.970
<v 3>So for a month before that we got knocked out in group stages,</v>

191
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.040
even though we went three and three sucks.

192
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:41.850
<v 0>Really try not to curse too much because like they want this footage, right.</v>

193
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:46.650
<v 3>My bad, sorry, Jubilee. Um, but yeah,</v>

194
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.630
after that, sorry. So.

195
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.400
<v 0>The last time it was for team looking at 2018.</v>

196
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.580
<v 3>Worlds and before that was kind of PSI</v>

197
00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.450
mid-season invitation and all that was in Berlin.

198
00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.130
And that one sucked because we had to play all our scrims in the hotel.

199
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.250
And for some reason there's no air conditioning in the hotels.

200
00:15:07.251 --> 00:15:11.330
So we were just screaming and like 95 degree heat and everyone was screaming,

201
00:15:11.331 --> 00:15:13.580
shirtless because it was so hot.

202
00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.720
<v 0>Playing games without air conditioning is like.</v>

203
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.280
<v 3>I'm like all the computers in the room and it's really hot,</v>

204
00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.350
really hot or he'd wait, that was it.

205
00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.480
<v 0>Wait, this was the first time we told somebody, okay, we gotta, we gotta get.</v>

206
00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:28.083
<v 3>The round. Just ended it.</v>

207
00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.120
It looks like green lantern and banana know each other.

208
00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:35.020
So I guess my best chance of survival would be to vote for Apple cat.

209
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.510
<v 1>I definitely think the odd man.</v>

210
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:42.100
<v 0>Apple cat was very specific. If I have to vote for anybody,</v>

211
00:15:42.101 --> 00:15:45.040
it's going to be Larry applicant seems pretty convincing. I mean,

212
00:15:45.041 --> 00:15:49.120
I know green lantern is we're friends. And so if we get a majority vote in,

213
00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.670
then it overrides the minority.

214
00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.200
<v 3>Uh, so I will vote for Apple, kept it go for me. So be it.</v>

215
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:58.060
I had my fun. Maybe I get kicked.

216
00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.710
<v 0>Off the Island. We're going to make this money.</v>

217
00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:04.960
<v 1>Is the person who is eliminated for round three is layered.</v>

218
00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:09.910
<v 0>Sorry. I feel bad. I feel bad.</v>

219
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:14.140
<v 3>I guess I kind of felt like I was, you know, people were going after me.</v>

220
00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:18.100
So yeah. That's how I expect to be voted off. So yeah.

221
00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:22.870
<v 1>If the box is green, I think when you win, if the box is red,</v>

222
00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:28.600
it's still in the game and you locked down Apple cat three, two,

223
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.943
one.

224
00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:34.990
<v 0>Winter. Yes, yes.</v>

225
00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.730
Heck yeah, let's go. Yeah, no, it was VR.

226
00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.090
You know what? It was?

227
00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:51.250
<v 1>The mold can raise their hand. Three, two,</v>

228
00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:52.600
one, go ahead.

229
00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:59.200
<v 0>Wow. All right.</v>

230
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:05.200
So set. When, uh, you're going after banana, I thought it was so safe.

231
00:17:05.201 --> 00:17:10.180
I was like, it is what it is. Here's what happened. So everybody was super cool.

232
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:14.260
I wish that I could have been involved in war. I'm sad to get around London,

233
00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:17.320
but you know, it happens. I learned anything from this experience,

234
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.980
no gaming as usual. And we ended up winning. So.

235
00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:24.310
<v 1>How cool is that? It was so awesome. Seeing two other women in the cast,</v>

236
00:17:24.311 --> 00:17:28.930
if people didn't know that women can be and our pro and our amazing this

237
00:17:28.931 --> 00:17:30.880
episode should teach people something.

238
00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.070
<v 0>For gamers, come in, all shapes and sizes.</v>

239
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:38.080
But I think the one thing that everyone has in common is the amount of effort

240
00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:41.290
they had to grind up their game to get to where they are.
