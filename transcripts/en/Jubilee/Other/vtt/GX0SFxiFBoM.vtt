00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.020
<v 1>I don't think through my crushes like that, I'm not like,</v>

2
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.610
I'm like, okay. I like him. Yeah.

3
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.540
But that's the thing you can like them as a friend, not Oh.

4
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.970
<v 0>Using bad words is okay. Three, two,</v>

5
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.440
one go.

6
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.710
<v 1>You shouldn't swear. That's a common fact. But then again,</v>

7
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.800
you have to let your anger out some way.

8
00:00:48.801 --> 00:00:53.600
So that's why I only somewhat disagree using well

9
00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:58.220
words. Can they have meaning? And when you use them, it means something.

10
00:00:58.221 --> 00:01:01.940
So when you use a bad word, it means like you're angry and you're not happy,

11
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.190
but when you need to use them, you can just scream in your pillow,

12
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.050
not yelling at someone.

13
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.780
And I don't think that you should just scream into your pillow.

14
00:01:11.781 --> 00:01:13.460
That's just going to bottle up your emotions.

15
00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:15.110
And that's just going to get worse and worse.

16
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.610
It's just going to eventually burst and you're going to see even more bad words

17
00:01:19.611 --> 00:01:23.120
than you should. Yeah. What if you just get a stress ball,

18
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.230
but that's for a specific, like physical,

19
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.830
or you said that if somebody is like really angry,

20
00:01:30.831 --> 00:01:34.310
so what if you just get a stress ball? But it depends on the person,

21
00:01:34.311 --> 00:01:37.820
in my opinion, squishing something. Isn't going to make me any happier. Like,

22
00:01:37.821 --> 00:01:41.720
let's say like you have like a best friend. No. And then like you, I don't know,

23
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:44.870
like you say like a swear word to them, then maybe they'll just like,

24
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.870
not wanna hang out with you because you like cuss and all.

25
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.030
I'm sorry if people here are not Christian, but it's against the Bible.

26
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.560
You shouldn't swear because it can also hurt a lot of people's feelings if you

27
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.420
swear directly at them. But yeah, you shouldn't do it.

28
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.830
I'm Christian. So I guess I'll just put in disagree.

29
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.010
<v 0>I have a crush on someone three, two,</v>

30
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.690
one go.

31
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.880
<v 1>Uh, okay. Ooh.</v>

32
00:02:21.881 --> 00:02:24.890
We're going to find out some romantic loving today's.

33
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.400
You should not love someone when you're this like,

34
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.650
like this age, it's like more of a mature thing. Like you,

35
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.850
you should just like, like people as friends, you shouldn't like,

36
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.440
love people. Like you want to marry them and stuff. Like,

37
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.980
like that's like high school, college thing at this age,

38
00:02:45.981 --> 00:02:47.630
we just like have crushed. We don't like,

39
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.920
love them to where we're marrying them and we're going to have kids.

40
00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:54.560
And I don't think through my crushes like that, I'm not like,

41
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.400
like, I'm like, I'm like, okay. I like him. Yeah. Yeah.

42
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.300
But that's the thing you can like them as a friend, not, Oh,

43
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.000
it's not like your choice. You can't like make yourself like forced,

44
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:17.590
like not like 'em or have a crush on them. It's a way of the heart though. Yeah.

45
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.550
It's okay. Liking someone is just like, shouldn't be too excited about this,

46
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.400
that you're going to like, so don't keep.

47
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.290
<v 0>Kids should be allowed to have cell phones. Three,</v>

48
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.750
two, one go.

49
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.550
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

50
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.500
I strongly agree because what if let's disagree to disagree?

51
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.420
Oh, sorry. It's okay, bro.

52
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.490
What if you got lost and your parents said that you

53
00:03:50.491 --> 00:03:53.490
couldn't have a cell phone? I wouldn't be able to call anybody.

54
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:54.840
Cause I wouldn't have a cell phone.

55
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.540
I have a phone and I use it for certain reasons.

56
00:03:57.541 --> 00:04:02.010
Like to FaceTime my friends and like face on my family and texts. And then like,

57
00:04:02.011 --> 00:04:06.660
I kind of don't really think we should have one is because we usually want to

58
00:04:06.661 --> 00:04:10.770
hang out with our friends, not stay on really devices all day,

59
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.790
children just, they could break the cell phones and drop it.

60
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.430
It's it depends on what age.

61
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.180
So that's why I believe it should be teenagers can have cell phones because they

62
00:04:21.181 --> 00:04:25.980
actually understand the world how to not break for like some like, um,

63
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.980
kids do have responsibility to from their parents,

64
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.990
but also because children could just access a bunch of really inappropriate

65
00:04:33.991 --> 00:04:38.310
things and you can go into like a like dark web or something on accident.

66
00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:40.350
And then like you could accidentally give your address.

67
00:04:40.351 --> 00:04:45.060
Like while playing like a game you could like accidentally like be like leaking

68
00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:47.730
in social media is in all parents technology.

69
00:04:47.731 --> 00:04:52.110
These days you can put child lock on your phone. Uh, that's a thing on YouTube.

70
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.250
You can put child walk. I'm pretty sure they can't like access certain things.

71
00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.600
If you post something wrong on accident, it stays there forever.

72
00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:03.570
Even though you delete it, it's still up there.

73
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.980
People can see that and then they can get into stuff that you don't want them to

74
00:05:07.981 --> 00:05:08.814
see.

75
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.380
<v 0>I understand what racism is.</v>

76
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.240
Three, two, one go.

77
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.510
<v 1>This is the saying, I feel like I've heard many people say, um,</v>

78
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.580
it doesn't matter. What's on the outside.

79
00:05:29.581 --> 00:05:31.500
That counts it's what's on the inside that counts.

80
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.300
Like what does like the skin like have to like affect you by back in the

81
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.140
forties and fifties, black people in Hispanic,

82
00:05:40.141 --> 00:05:44.730
people were being like harassed by white

83
00:05:44.731 --> 00:05:48.600
people. No offense. And it's fine.

84
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.720
Like they used to get water hose.

85
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.460
I know that black people didn't like that because what if the white people were

86
00:05:56.461 --> 00:05:59.270
black people and they were being treated like that.

87
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.190
Like they don't know what it feels like.

88
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:04.070
They just think that they have all the power.

89
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.390
They can just do whatever they want it because we were helpless.

90
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.810
People are stereotyped over the color of the skin,

91
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:16.070
which doesn't make any sense because everyone's mean at some point everyone's

92
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.950
upset at some point. Everyone's nice at some point,

93
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.670
but I just don't get why people are stereotyped by their skin.

94
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.630
We're all the same. We're all human beings. If we're,

95
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.110
if we're from different places, it's like, if it's alert, there's a lot of sun.

96
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:34.100
You have more melanin in your skin. If it's like more cold, barely any sun,

97
00:06:34.101 --> 00:06:35.990
you have less Mellon.

98
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.130
We have to respect each other with the same ways you want to be respected

99
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.740
and people get killed just by protesting.

100
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.390
And then it just makes me so sad.

101
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.260
Like they're just trying to get their own right. It's a good way to put.

102
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:56.710
<v 0>I'm afraid of climate change. Three, two,</v>

103
00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.210
one go.

104
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.310
I'm born to be here.

105
00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.850
<v 1>Okay. So there's no point of being afraid of climate change.</v>

106
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.000
Like you can be like, concerned about it,

107
00:07:13.001 --> 00:07:17.920
like about the animals that live in like different climates,

108
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.400
like places, but places. Yeah.

109
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.420
There's no point of you to be afraid because you're used to like warm weather

110
00:07:25.421 --> 00:07:29.320
and like a little cooler weather, but you can be concerned about it.

111
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.790
It's actually our fault.

112
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:35.080
We're making more pollution and pollution and pollution. It's making the air.

113
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.820
It's why you're just not concerned about it.

114
00:07:36.821 --> 00:07:40.300
That's why people are switching to electric cars because gasoline is part of it.

115
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.410
But, but people are now like changing to electricity,

116
00:07:44.411 --> 00:07:47.350
but still electricity is made with gas.

117
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.660
And I don't know what it's called, but there's like over the planet,

118
00:07:52.661 --> 00:07:56.170
there's like a big protection from the sun rays.

119
00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.920
It was really extreme on us and burn ourselves to death.

120
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.180
But we're destroying that. And that's why we're endangering ourselves too.

121
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.480
I just really remember. But like grammar, like when we had to like go back away,

122
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:08.860
like from like some of our homes,

123
00:08:08.861 --> 00:08:12.070
like how it was like showing like a couple of weeks ago because like fires,

124
00:08:12.071 --> 00:08:16.900
I was going on wildfire, climate change. Maybe we should be scared.

125
00:08:16.901 --> 00:08:20.080
I'm not saying that you should have to. Well, that's just being concerned.

126
00:08:20.081 --> 00:08:23.890
There's no, there's no point of being afraid. Like, Oh my gosh,

127
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.670
you're going to die. There's like no point because you are going to die.

128
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:30.610
That's the thing. Not for sure. But you might

129
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:38.950
[inaudible] but you will guarantee you have third degree burns be drowned to the

130
00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:40.450
point where you become a fish.

131
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:46.840
<v 0>I miss going to school in person three,</v>

132
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.120
two, one go,

133
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.600
Oh gosh. I'm. So.

134
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:05.270
<v 1>I strongly agree on going to school because you can like</v>

135
00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.490
get more help from your teachers and you get to see your friends again,

136
00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:11.690
in my opinion,

137
00:09:11.691 --> 00:09:16.190
there's just no reason to have to want to do school at,

138
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:16.971
in pretty soon.

139
00:09:16.971 --> 00:09:21.500
And that's just way less safety with this whole COVID-19 going on.

140
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:25.940
But then as for distractions, you can just turn on safety lock or something.

141
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.133
We're get grounded.

142
00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:30.770
There's not only distractions on your phone and your computer like that.

143
00:09:30.771 --> 00:09:34.430
You can just put a lock on. You can also get distracted.

144
00:09:34.431 --> 00:09:35.450
Like if you're in your room,

145
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.660
because I'm sure your parents will be doing something in the other rooms.

146
00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:39.800
But I also like,

147
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:44.180
feel like school is great because your teacher can give you like one-on-one time

148
00:09:44.181 --> 00:09:46.730
and go to your desk and help you with a certain problem.

149
00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:51.450
And you also get to like, see your friends. A bunch of my friends, I know have,

150
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.440
um, do online and are like failing their classes.

151
00:09:54.441 --> 00:09:58.190
And the exact same thing happened to me except like I was winging it like

152
00:09:58.191 --> 00:10:02.030
online. And then I had like straight like F's, but then like,

153
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.480
I like went to like the school school and then changed all my grades to A's and

154
00:10:05.481 --> 00:10:06.314
B's.

155
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:12.620
<v 0>Adult are always right. Three, two,</v>

156
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.300
one go.

157
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.570
<v 1>Don't completely disagree. I'm sure that every adult isn't always right,</v>

158
00:10:23.571 --> 00:10:25.700
because women are always right.

159
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.260
But you can have some credits, telekinetic, mind,

160
00:10:30.261 --> 00:10:34.340
power that lets you be right. A hundred percent of the time.

161
00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:39.320
Sometimes my teacher gets things wrong and sometimes the students have to

162
00:10:39.321 --> 00:10:40.580
correct. My teacher,

163
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:45.650
my grandma has a daycare and one of her helpers that used to work for

164
00:10:45.651 --> 00:10:47.960
her, she didn't go to school.

165
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:52.520
So she kind of didn't know anything. No one's ever like right.

166
00:10:52.521 --> 00:10:55.970
All the time. Like, no matter if you're an adult or a kid,

167
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.760
I feel like parents just say they're always right.

168
00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.150
Because they like want you to do something else.

169
00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.690
Instead of playing video games all day, they want you to go outside. So like,

170
00:11:05.691 --> 00:11:08.470
I feel like that's outside. I run out your energy.

171
00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:13.700
<v 0>Making friends is hard. Three,</v>

172
00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:15.980
two go.

173
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:28.640
<v 1>Really talkative. So I will just like go up to someone and I'll be like, Hey,</v>

174
00:11:28.641 --> 00:11:32.390
what's your name? And then we'll start a full-blown conversation.

175
00:11:32.391 --> 00:11:33.770
And then we'll swap numbers.

176
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.700
And also acting makes it a lot easier to make friends like this.

177
00:11:37.701 --> 00:11:42.650
Like when you're working on set with someone you're literally just like with so

178
00:11:42.651 --> 00:11:44.510
many other kids that you can make friends with.

179
00:11:44.511 --> 00:11:48.050
So I feel like it's easy whenever I'm doing like my magic to like,

180
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.880
like someone I did make like quite a lot of friends and all, um, it was easier.

181
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.070
I was talking and it wasn't like talking about like art stuff.

182
00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:59.740
But I was talking about like what I've loved. And while I was doing Juan,

183
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:04.750
I'm going to have to disagree with you because you said that you did

184
00:12:04.751 --> 00:12:07.660
a magic trick and now people want to be your friend. Right?

185
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.000
What if you are a regular kid,

186
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.650
some people just want to be friends with you because you're either famous or

187
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:19.210
you're rich. I know, but I wasn't rich or famous. You're really cool. So like,

188
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.120
what if you were just like a basic kid,

189
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.840
do you think they would still be friends with you? Well,

190
00:12:25.841 --> 00:12:28.570
most likely because some of it was like out on,

191
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:32.560
like outside was what's on the inside of that counted right there at that time,

192
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.590
I just be myself and I just see if they wanted to be friends with me or not,

193
00:12:37.591 --> 00:12:41.160
because it all, it just depends on what they think of me.

194
00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:45.570
Sometimes I have to act to get friends because

195
00:12:45.571 --> 00:12:50.370
sometimes I, I hear their conversations and they're saying that they like,

196
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.940
don't like to be friends with my type of personality.

197
00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:58.050
I kind of feel like I'm lying because it's like,

198
00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:01.740
it's not like truly me and I just,

199
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:05.910
I prefer getting friends like the way I actually am.

200
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.060
I don't.

201
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:13.080
<v 0>Want to grow up three, two, one, go.</v>

202
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:23.250
<v 1>I honestly want to grow up because it's like part of life and you just get</v>

203
00:13:23.251 --> 00:13:26.850
to experience different things. Um, depending on your age,

204
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.970
I want to be like a kid,

205
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:35.190
but like staying in care forever is like being in school for a long time

206
00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.840
and like re like redoing your grades. And it's like not fun. And you, if you,

207
00:13:39.841 --> 00:13:43.290
when you grow up, you can have a job and do what you love. I mean,

208
00:13:43.291 --> 00:13:45.960
technically as long as you're good at school,

209
00:13:45.961 --> 00:13:47.820
if you just keep repeating the same classes,

210
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.640
it's not the worst thing that can happen is just like, you're,

211
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:54.300
it's like you're reviewing this same thing you learned last year.

212
00:13:54.301 --> 00:13:56.460
And like it you're, and then you get bored of it.

213
00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:58.620
That's why you want to move onto something new.

214
00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:03.600
I strongly agree on not growing up because I won't have to pay any

215
00:14:03.601 --> 00:14:07.410
bills. Once you grow up,

216
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:12.360
you learn a lot more so you can get a job and then it's easier to pay bills

217
00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:13.590
and pay taxes.

218
00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:18.990
I want grew up because at the same time you get older and older life does go

219
00:14:18.991 --> 00:14:22.320
on and you really won't have a childhood again.

220
00:14:22.321 --> 00:14:26.060
And change is good and change can be bad, but you'll know too.

221
00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:28.643
<v 0>Awesome.</v>

222
00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:54.240
[inaudible].
