00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.570
<v 0>Yo no way. Oh my God,</v>

2
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.840
what does success look like?

3
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.210
We found two millionaires and as 10 strangers to tell us who they think is the

4
00:00:14.211 --> 00:00:18.650
more successful one. But we asked our entire audience the same question.

5
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.360
If our strangers choose the same as our audience, they went cold, hard cash.

6
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.100
If they choose the opposite, they win nothing. Welcome to crossing them.

7
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.270
Hello, everybody. Welcome across the Milan. What the game means.

8
00:00:35.271 --> 00:00:40.160
And you've chosen the same person. That's an audience. You win every round.

9
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.800
You will have a chance to switch to the other side.

10
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.930
Although switching to the other side comes with decrease your cash prize.

11
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.050
Every room, that penalty doubles.

12
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.380
We're all absolutely terrified. Middle-class

13
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.620
the first guys in front of wall street. That's the wall street bull behind him.

14
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.940
Yeah, but here's the thing.

15
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.380
I'll show you guys has a tyrant has a literal dinosaur skull next to him, bro.

16
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.130
That's true. Dinosaur Jurassic parks.

17
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.820
So the first one serious, or they expect a millionaire to kind of be,

18
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.700
but the second one is welcoming. Here's the thing. The second one,

19
00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:20.510
the guy in front of the wall street bull. It looks like it's like Photoshop.

20
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.730
What is his watch? No, watch it. Oh, no watches.

21
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.710
Okay. The first one looks like a LinkedIn profile. Like picture like a headshot.

22
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.540
First one looks at younger two.

23
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.770
The first one reminds me more of like a YouTuber rather than I dunno.

24
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.350
It's like the whole homes kind of thing that I like.

25
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.050
If I were to go to YouTube and watch someone

26
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.660
listen to this. Geez, it's hilarious. You got the dinosaur bones.

27
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.880
First person, Sam.

28
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.500
I am going with person to Jonathan or send to da.

29
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.870
I have a good feeling about person too. I'm feeling it in my soul, Adrian.

30
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.550
I am going with the majority person to Ronnie. Uh,

31
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.230
I'm going to go with person one storm, one person to Bryce,

32
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.740
Triston stigma person too. I like the dinosaur Darian. I'll go with person one.

33
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.400
So I'd be going on person one. All right, everybody.

34
00:02:19.401 --> 00:02:24.110
So your initial boats are locked in any switching after this point is going to

35
00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:28.850
result in a penalty. Okay.

36
00:02:28.851 --> 00:02:31.880
I'm looking at GP Stefan and he's with the guy from shark tank.

37
00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:35.900
I think it's Kevin for shark tank. First guy has 1.5 million followers,

38
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.300
crazy 5 million followers. Oh second. Guy's a realtor real estate investor.

39
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.160
Or it turned 12 camp.

40
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.050
YouTube has 2.4 million all over the place.

41
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.610
He's in a private play in the first guy. A lot of things happening right now.

42
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.630
Okay. I think the first guy does stocks. Like that's all I can fight,

43
00:02:56.631 --> 00:02:59.440
but he does charity. You guys often Heim is, is um,

44
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.530
selling sunset on Netflix.

45
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.460
Oh wait by the oftentime group. I'm pretty sure. Yeah. No. The second guy,

46
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.600
he is his, his real real estate company selling sunset associates.

47
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.820
And that's like a TV show. Yeah. He just got a Tesla. I can see that.

48
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.330
I will say, I will say GP. Stefan has more photos with like other people.

49
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.600
He looks like he has more of like a successful life. Not in money,

50
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.530
which is something to consider. First guy seems like he travels a lot.

51
00:03:28.531 --> 00:03:29.364
So there's lots of,

52
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.020
[inaudible] a highlight on donations.

53
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.230
Do you think that the audience likes that? Like someone who's doing charity?

54
00:03:37.231 --> 00:03:39.450
I feel like that could be. I think so.

55
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.240
I think this is the other guy not to a charity. It's not mean.

56
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.210
Yeah. It's not as isolated. Lots of cars on the second guys.

57
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.150
Lots of lots of cars. Very nice house.

58
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.300
The second guy and time is up

59
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.460
now. Would anybody like to cross the line?

60
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.480
I'm crossing the line. I'm crossing the line to Timothy.

61
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.770
I think that might cross the line. Timmy.

62
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.210
It's going good. I have rapid fire questions. One minute and 30 seconds,

63
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.960
gentlemen. There's a lot riding on it. John formalities let's get right to it.

64
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.150
What is it that you do? Your official titles?

65
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.230
I'm a YouTuber real estate investor and real estate agent. Tim,

66
00:04:34.231 --> 00:04:37.500
can you explain what's your job or how you made money? Well,

67
00:04:37.501 --> 00:04:38.880
I'm a stock trader and teacher.

68
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.100
I was in a reality show called wall street warriors.

69
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.900
That was a hit and allowed me to really get into my true love of teaching.

70
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.880
Have you donated any of your money to, um, charities or anything like that?

71
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.380
Absolutely, but I don't post about it. How important is money to you? Really?

72
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.750
It gives you time. You know, freedom.

73
00:04:57.751 --> 00:05:01.140
Like too many people are just working at jobs they hate and they're kind of

74
00:05:01.141 --> 00:05:03.570
wasting their lives away. Just trying to like catch up.

75
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.970
Would either of you categorize yourself as more successful than the other?

76
00:05:05.971 --> 00:05:10.230
I don't know how much you know about each other. You wouldn't say that. Okay.

77
00:05:10.231 --> 00:05:14.100
That's not a good question. Your role model, Joe Rogan for me or Dave Ramsey,

78
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.570
Elon Musk, Richard Branson. Have you had any like struggles?

79
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.590
Both of my parents went through bankruptcy when I was a teenager after I made my

80
00:05:22.591 --> 00:05:24.990
first 2 million in college and I lost a third of it.

81
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.590
It was splashed all over the press and it made me an infinitely better and more

82
00:05:28.591 --> 00:05:29.424
conservative trade.

83
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.900
It was a fast food restaurant that is too expensive for you to be like,

84
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.850
and that's worth it. I think now AAA, because their staples are like seven, $8.

85
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:39.930
Sometimes I'm just starving.

86
00:05:39.931 --> 00:05:43.350
So I don't even care if it's like five bucks or 50 bucks, I just eat.

87
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.400
What is your net worth? Timothy? Um, I mean,

88
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.320
probably you could call it around 20, 25 million Graham. Wow. Uh,

89
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.470
about 7.3 million. And how old are you? Timothy?

90
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.880
I am 39 and gram 30.

91
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.270
What were you saying your biggest accomplishment in building a YouTube channel

92
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.310
has been one of the most rewarding and challenging things I've ever done in my

93
00:06:06.311 --> 00:06:07.144
entire life.

94
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.230
There'll be 70 schools in my charity so far and teaching other people now.

95
00:06:11.231 --> 00:06:15.070
So I have five millionaire students so far. Um, it's a lot of work,

96
00:06:15.071 --> 00:06:19.210
but education changes lives. Okay. Jonathan time.

97
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.470
Wow. Hi. Hi.

98
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.260
She was strict. That was like a job in rapid fire. I hope I pass

99
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:38.380
David bro. There might be millionaires, but I need this money bro. Yeah,

100
00:06:38.381 --> 00:06:41.860
that guy said Chipotle. I was like, yo,

101
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.260
Tim said he'll eat anything.

102
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.140
So I got to switch sides because Tim is too financially,

103
00:06:47.141 --> 00:06:51.490
reckless 20 something million and Graham has

104
00:06:51.491 --> 00:06:54.100
7.6 net worth or something like that. Very good. Cute.

105
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.760
I asked about like their background and they said they both like came from like

106
00:06:57.761 --> 00:07:00.430
modest background. Cause that was one thing I was going to do criteria,

107
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.900
but they're basically the same for that.

108
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.650
Timothy was talking about how he was on a TV show called warriors of wall street

109
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.570
for me. He said that and I was like, okay,

110
00:07:07.571 --> 00:07:11.950
well he was already a warrior of gold street in general to have even been on the

111
00:07:11.951 --> 00:07:16.600
show. I also asked like what they think their biggest accomplishment is. And uh,

112
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.060
Graham, I believe said that his was like the YouTube channel,

113
00:07:19.061 --> 00:07:21.250
like building a huge platform. Timothy asks a question.

114
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.300
He dropped the bomb of being able to build somebody schools like,

115
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.230
Oh yeah. I bought some new schools. That's impressive. Impressive.

116
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:38.650
Now it's your chance to cross the line.

117
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:44.680
I am crossing the line to Tim. I think I'm going to cross the line with him

118
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.890
diagram. You're really nice. I'm crossing the line to Tim. Oh no trusted.

119
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:57.940
Some of you crossed the line and sacrifice some of your prize money in the

120
00:07:57.941 --> 00:08:00.010
spirit of ending up on the right side.

121
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.670
And some of you stuck with your guns all the way through,

122
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.280
but there's only one way to win.

123
00:08:06.281 --> 00:08:08.680
And that is being on the side of public opinion.

124
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.790
I guess you guys kind of put yourself in an all or nothing situation. Wow.

125
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:19.653
[inaudible]

126
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.160
[inaudible] I thought no way even going into it, I was like, it's going to

127
00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:39.130
with it. Oh no. I can't believe we all lost.

128
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.640
I'm kind of in shock that we all lost. Everyone wins in this group.

129
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.410
Everyone wins. No, one's a loser.

130
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.750
I'm personally going to give you the money that you would've done

131
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.890
a lot twist. I got another fun one.

132
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:57.390
I'll add onto that for everyone in the first round,

133
00:08:57.391 --> 00:08:59.100
I'll give you $200,

134
00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:06.870
$201 because Graham doesn't beat me.

135
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.390
<v 1>Wow. This was crazy.</v>

136
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.030
Invest in stocks. Should I get my realtor license?

137
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.270
<v 0>Seriously? Thank you. Thank you guys.</v>

138
00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:21.620
<v 1>Right?</v>
