1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.050
<v 0>I don't think that the legislation was passed definitively in the interest of</v>

2
00:00:04.051 --> 00:00:07.350
putting more black people in jail. That's what it did,

3
00:00:07.351 --> 00:00:10.350
but I don't think Joe Biden was sitting in a room legislating like, hell yeah,

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.790
he's black. And for sure.

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.750
<v 1>With the election upon us,</v>

6
00:00:14.751 --> 00:00:18.410
millions of Americans are gearing up to cast their vote for the next president

7
00:00:18.411 --> 00:00:21.830
of the United States. While some people will be voting independent.

8
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.820
We want it to hear from Trump voters and Biden voters about why they are voting

9
00:00:25.821 --> 00:00:28.010
for their candidate in spectrum.

10
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.670
We bring everyday people together for authentic discussions that represent

11
00:00:31.671 --> 00:00:32.810
what's happening. Now,

12
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.220
these discussions should not be anyone sole source forming opinions on important

13
00:00:37.221 --> 00:00:40.850
issues. Please do your own research, seek out experts,

14
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.630
push yourself outside your bubble and have empathy. Thanks for watching.

15
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.100
<v 2>My name is Christina.</v>

16
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.970
<v 1>And I am 23 years old and I live in Houston, Texas.</v>

17
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.540
I think that the overall civic health of America is just so low.

18
00:00:56.541 --> 00:00:59.030
And I feel like the more we have these kinds of conversations,

19
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.350
the more people will start to think for them.

20
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.670
<v 2>Hi, I'm Piper. I'm passionate about decolonization,</v>

21
00:01:04.671 --> 00:01:06.020
systemic equality,

22
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.770
socialism and environmentalism name is [inaudible].

23
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.680
I'm currently a freshman at the university of Texas at Austin.

24
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.260
It's one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime.

25
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.110
It's going to determine the future of our country and civil rights,

26
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.440
human rights, the climate, and many other issues across the board.

27
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.360
My name is Leah Talas and I'm an environmental activist and the founder of the

28
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.290
intersectional environmentalist platform. My name is Chris.

29
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.690
I currently live in Santa Barbara, California.

30
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.820
I think that a vote for Joe Biden and this election is a vote with the idea of

31
00:01:37.821 --> 00:01:41.120
prosperity for all in mind. Hi, I'm Benjamin.

32
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.710
I work at the democratic coordinator campaign and I help lead a young Asian

33
00:01:45.711 --> 00:01:46.940
Americans for Biden.

34
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.470
We cannot afford to be anything less than passionate as we fight to protect our

35
00:01:51.471 --> 00:01:54.890
families, our friends, our communities, and our futures.

36
00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.030
<v 1>Anti-Trump than pro Biden.</v>

37
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.290
<v 0>Strongly agree, but yeah.</v>

38
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.680
<v 2>Strongly agree. Prinav strongly agree.</v>

39
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.780
Benjamin somewhat disagree. Chris. Strongly agree.

40
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.730
Christine agree.

41
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.070
<v 3>As much as I like absolutely hate Trump, there has to be like young,</v>

42
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.760
especially young people. Like there needs to be that energy there for Biden.

43
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.230
Like I know settle for Biden is huge. Like, well,

44
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.780
we'll take him cause there's two choices. No,

45
00:02:26.781 --> 00:02:31.100
this is like literally a choice between like destruction of the

46
00:02:31.101 --> 00:02:34.760
environment and our futures or building towards better progress.

47
00:02:34.761 --> 00:02:38.660
We have to be more enthusiastic and we have to bring other people along because

48
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.240
otherwise, like we're not going to win.

49
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.310
<v 0>Definitely agree with what you just said, uh, Benjamin. But at the same time,</v>

50
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:50.930
like I can't deny like Joe Biden himself does not make me

51
00:02:50.931 --> 00:02:52.400
respond. Enthusiastically.

52
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.550
Like I volunteered for the candidate I supported in the primary is the first

53
00:02:55.551 --> 00:02:58.610
time had ever done it. And it was because I was so I was driven.

54
00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:00.010
Like I feel like I needed to.

55
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.170
<v 2>At the same time. Um,</v>

56
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.300
I think I would vote for a democratic ticket if it was literally any other

57
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:11.350
democratic candidate. I understand the enthusiasm Benjamin.

58
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:13.810
And I think the reason why, like, so I didn't vote.

59
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.920
I voted for Warren in the primary. I was very involved with the campaign. Um,

60
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.070
and like I, if I could put anyone in the white house right now, it'd be her.

61
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.390
But I think like the supporting cast is so important. Like you said,

62
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:26.590
I'm voting for a better future.

63
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:29.050
And I don't think that Biden encompasses that entirely.

64
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.620
I think that the entire democratic coalition encompasses that.

65
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.250
<v 4>Benjamin, you brought up a good point though. Um,</v>

66
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.900
I've like read a bit about like why Hillary Clinton lost in 2016.

67
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.730
And a lot of it was because she ran on a very like anti-Trump campaign because

68
00:03:44.731 --> 00:03:46.650
Hillary Clinton was like a very hated woman.

69
00:03:46.651 --> 00:03:48.210
Like a lot of people just don't like her.

70
00:03:48.211 --> 00:03:50.640
Like I have my reasons for not liking her as well.

71
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.920
And her whole campaign was just like beat Trump, be Trump,

72
00:03:52.921 --> 00:03:56.790
be Trump and a lot of people that wasn't enough for them to get excited behind.

73
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.520
And so you kind of made me like rethink it a little bit,

74
00:03:59.521 --> 00:04:03.210
but I think also though we can't get too excited about him now because we have

75
00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:05.880
to still make sure that there's room for criticism so we can hold him

76
00:04:05.881 --> 00:04:08.040
accountable. Once he actually gets elected.

77
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.040
<v 2>Joe Biden is too old to be president Piper,</v>

78
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.110
somewhat disagree, disagree, disagree,

79
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.190
Benjamin strongly disagree. Chris disagree,

80
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.330
Christine disagree. Let's say like,

81
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.020
all hell did break loose. And like Joe Biden is now like,

82
00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:34.650
like just suddenly just becomes like cognitively incapable of doing the job.

83
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.620
Kamala Harris. She's a beast. So I mean with the vice presidents for right.

84
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.670
I think the only person who could really say like strongly agree it was is like

85
00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:49.530
a Pete voter. I mean, the person I voted for the primary was also like 70 plus.

86
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.250
So.

87
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.980
<v 3>His age kind of also fits with his,</v>

88
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.300
like his demeanor or like his appeal. He is more like a,

89
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.050
like a grandfather figure of the like entire party.

90
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.170
That age comes with a lot of experience. And like,

91
00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:08.070
I think right now we need to return to some sort of normalcy.

92
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.150
<v 4>I also really hate when people pick out a stutter that he's having for like his</v>

93
00:05:12.151 --> 00:05:14.910
whole life, uh, is incredibly able to yeah.

94
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.000
The candidate that I was supporting was older than him and you know,

95
00:05:18.001 --> 00:05:19.890
Trump's old, so it's fine.

96
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.500
<v 2>I believe abortion is a human right. Piper,</v>

97
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.450
strongly agree. Leah agree. Prinav strong.

98
00:05:30.451 --> 00:05:35.040
Regroup. Benjamin only agree. Chris strongly agree,

99
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.140
Christine. I agree.

100
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.700
<v 4>I feel like there's a separation of church and state and people just keep</v>

101
00:05:41.701 --> 00:05:44.670
forgetting that. I don't know. I don't know why I'm also,

102
00:05:44.671 --> 00:05:48.870
I don't think anyone like likes abortion and that choice is one that is

103
00:05:48.871 --> 00:05:51.900
incredibly traumatic and hard for I'm sure a lot of people.

104
00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:55.380
And I just really don't like when people are like, well, no abortions,

105
00:05:55.381 --> 00:05:58.910
no sex education, no contraception, no nothing. And it's like,

106
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.440
there's so many other things that would actually help decrease the amount of

107
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:06.800
abortions that are had. If we could get better sex education in school,

108
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.450
easier access to contraception and healthcare or to abortion is not in the

109
00:06:11.451 --> 00:06:16.220
Bible. Step one, step two. I'm not having an abortion. I don't,

110
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.580
I would never do that. I'm in a situation. And I just that's what I believe,

111
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:21.980
but that's not my job to enforce that on other people.

112
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.350
And going back to what you said, like sex education,

113
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.700
or why not putting so forth some type of like grant or something.

114
00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:32.300
If people decide not to afford it, why not improving the foster care system?

115
00:06:32.301 --> 00:06:34.760
I mean, they're not giving us any other options.

116
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.320
So you want me to have the baby,

117
00:06:36.321 --> 00:06:38.180
but you're not going to give me anything to support it.

118
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:40.790
You're not getting improved minimum wage and you're not going to do anything in

119
00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:43.550
my neighborhood to make this safe for my child. So.

120
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.010
<v 2>What's next first off. I don't believe that life starts at conception.</v>

121
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.790
I do not believe that constitutionally makes sense for a fully grown woman to be

122
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.780
constituted on the same level as a cluster of cells and that they should give

123
00:06:55.781 --> 00:06:58.960
out. Like they shouldn't have to like sacrifice like the right to their bodily

124
00:06:58.961 --> 00:07:02.740
autonomy. The second thing is also, I kind of compare it to like prostitution.

125
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:07.120
Like it's going to happen to some extent regardless and making it legal and like

126
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.860
having, like having there be like institutions, um,

127
00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:14.110
and like infrastructure for it to be like safe and affordable is a lot better

128
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.830
regardless of whether or not someone thinks that an abortion is good. Um,

129
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.290
you at least want like a woman to be safe.

130
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.190
<v 4>I think this is one of the biggest reasons to vote for Joe Biden, um,</v>

131
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.810
is because Trump has selected a Supreme court nominee who like

132
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.680
is devout at overturning Roe V. Wade,

133
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.370
if you support autonomy, I think you have to vote for Joe Biden.

134
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.040
Joe Biden has.

135
00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.960
<v 2>A racist past.</v>

136
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.690
<v 4>I said, agree, somewhat disagree.</v>

137
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:52.300
<v 2>Somewhat disagree, Benjamin, somewhat disagree. Chris,</v>

138
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.730
somewhat disagree, Christine.

139
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.390
<v 4>Um, what disagree? I think there's just goes back to like,</v>

140
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:03.340
what do we define as racism, but just looking at his policies,

141
00:08:03.341 --> 00:08:07.810
which are kind of the only thing we can go off of like the 1994 crime bill,

142
00:08:07.811 --> 00:08:11.050
like it almost exclusively targeted black Americans.

143
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.690
I know like he also in the Obama administration,

144
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:18.070
when they had a lot of mass deportations war crimes in the middle East and all

145
00:08:18.071 --> 00:08:19.660
these things put together,

146
00:08:19.661 --> 00:08:24.010
like I can't determine like his individual like opinions,

147
00:08:24.011 --> 00:08:26.020
but all I can go off of is his policies.

148
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.200
And he just has a pretty racist history.

149
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:34.270
<v 2>I don't believe that Joe Biden, the person as an individual is a racist man. Um,</v>

150
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:39.130
but I do think like he has had a history of not making choices that were the

151
00:08:39.131 --> 00:08:40.180
most equitable,

152
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.000
but I also think some of those choices were result of like the cultural

153
00:08:43.001 --> 00:08:43.990
zeitgeist at the time.

154
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.800
And I don't think that Joe Biden necessarily should be held to account for like

155
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.900
the worst parts of that legislation.

156
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.830
Because I don't think that the legislation was passed definitively in the

157
00:08:53.831 --> 00:08:56.460
interest of putting more people in jail.

158
00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.820
That's what it did because of the way everything was structured at the time.

159
00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:01.500
Like more black people went to jail,

160
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.710
but I'm hoping Joe Biden was sitting in a room legislating like, hell yeah,

161
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.840
he's black people. For sure, for sure. You know,

162
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.690
even if which I don't believe to be the case at all.

163
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.860
Even if he had like some ball of hatred in his heart against like communities of

164
00:09:13.861 --> 00:09:18.000
color, it's political suicide for him not to help communities of color.

165
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.570
<v 3>Someone who has worked in the Biden campaign,</v>

166
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.410
like he has plans to help like African-American communities.

167
00:09:24.411 --> 00:09:27.620
He has plans to help like Asian American and Pacific Islander communities.

168
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.220
They're like on his website, like they're part of the platform.

169
00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.580
We have like the power to hold them to it and say like,

170
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.140
we elected you to do these things.

171
00:09:36.141 --> 00:09:38.540
Like these are the things you promised us that you would do.

172
00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.270
And now we expect you because you voted for you.

173
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.550
Like we expect you to follow through on those promises.

174
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.860
<v 2>Police department should be defunded Piper,</v>

175
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.970
strongly agree. Leah, strongly agree.

176
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:57.680
Pranav somewhat agreed. Benjamin I'm on agree.

177
00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.570
Chris agree. And Christine somewhat disagree.

178
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:07.850
<v 3>I feel like there's not like if we were to defund the police,</v>

179
00:10:07.851 --> 00:10:12.020
now there's not structures in place to reallocate that funding efficiently.

180
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.750
Like I feel like in order to defund the police,

181
00:10:14.751 --> 00:10:16.910
we need to fund other things first.

182
00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:21.020
And then we can just like build the pipeline so that there's money to go into

183
00:10:21.021 --> 00:10:24.320
wherever we think is best. Like, I just worry that like,

184
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:26.450
if we were to defund the police,

185
00:10:26.451 --> 00:10:29.690
now it would just like get thrown back into the government and then it would

186
00:10:29.691 --> 00:10:31.100
just like go somewhere else to use it.

187
00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:35.360
<v 5>Um, so I say somewhat disagree because like in Houston,</v>

188
00:10:35.361 --> 00:10:38.210
I'm part of like the myrcene and leadership Alliance and something we've talked

189
00:10:38.211 --> 00:10:41.270
about with the mayor of Houston is that he doesn't feel like the police should

190
00:10:41.271 --> 00:10:41.841
be defended,

191
00:10:41.841 --> 00:10:45.560
but he feels like the money that's in the police system right now should go

192
00:10:45.561 --> 00:10:50.240
towards bringing other people into the system to actually handle the issues that

193
00:10:50.241 --> 00:10:52.970
police are getting call for them, nothing to do with police, right.

194
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.520
Homelessness, mental health issues.

195
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:58.370
And so like when I did a lot of like research and looking at what other

196
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:59.750
democratic candidates feel like,

197
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.870
a lot of those people don't feel like there needs to be a defunding of the

198
00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:03.201
police,

199
00:11:03.201 --> 00:11:07.910
but more so I reform of the police structure and how they facilitate the

200
00:11:07.911 --> 00:11:11.900
issue. So I don't think that defunding the police will lead to better policing.

201
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:15.740
I think for me after the aftermath of Ferguson, like,

202
00:11:15.741 --> 00:11:19.340
which impacted my hometown, I just really having some questions, like,

203
00:11:19.341 --> 00:11:22.460
why do they need tanks? Why do they need these grenades?

204
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.910
Why are they at war with us? And that, to me,

205
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:29.600
just made me take a step back with some of the equipment and resources that they

206
00:11:29.601 --> 00:11:33.500
have from the military and Christie and I, I a hundred percent agree.

207
00:11:33.501 --> 00:11:36.470
And I think when I support defending the police,

208
00:11:36.471 --> 00:11:38.180
I support dismantling the police,

209
00:11:38.181 --> 00:11:40.760
which is very different from abolishing the police,

210
00:11:40.761 --> 00:11:43.460
even though people like to spin it as that. And to me,

211
00:11:43.461 --> 00:11:47.840
there's already been enough police reform, especially since 2014,

212
00:11:47.841 --> 00:11:49.940
we've got the cameras, we've got trainings,

213
00:11:49.941 --> 00:11:54.550
but like there needs to be some sort of dismantling restructuring.

214
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:58.480
<v 4>Or something because whatever is happening is not working.</v>

215
00:11:58.481 --> 00:12:00.970
But of course I would never say, get rid of the police,

216
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.670
but I definitely don't think that they need to have tanks,

217
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.520
especially if they're not doing implicit bias training.

218
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:10.780
I think defund the police like has such a bad connotation to it because it does

219
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:13.000
sound like this abrupt, like take away all their money,

220
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:16.330
but you can't fit a whole public policy plan into one slogan.

221
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:22.570
Some of the like top like brains in policy writing that

222
00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.870
support defunding the police don't support just taking away all their funding

223
00:12:25.871 --> 00:12:27.550
and doing nothing with it. And I think honestly,

224
00:12:27.551 --> 00:12:29.410
if you reallocate the funds well enough,

225
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.710
we won't even need police at all eventually because why do police exist?

226
00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:34.030
Because people are committing crimes.

227
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.210
Why does crime exist because of poverty because of, you know,

228
00:12:37.211 --> 00:12:40.270
all these other reasons. So I think obviously not all at once,

229
00:12:40.271 --> 00:12:43.450
but like if we gradually reallocate those funds into other resources,

230
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.360
we could get rid of a lot of the things that even require the need for police.

231
00:12:46.361 --> 00:12:48.760
And maybe still have some law enforcement that exists,

232
00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.340
but it will not be as big of a thing as it is now.

233
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.460
<v 5>I think that is a very good point. That one,</v>

234
00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.610
a lot of these terms have like really strong connotations, right?

235
00:12:56.611 --> 00:12:59.310
So like when Lisa dismantle, I was like, Jesus, like,

236
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:03.240
but like not even really like understanding the perception of this mantle that

237
00:13:03.241 --> 00:13:06.540
she had. And so I think I really strongly agree that like,

238
00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.870
when we say defund the police, where does that money go? Right.

239
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.780
Because in my head, when I hear defund the police,

240
00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:16.320
I don't think that the police force is then going to take away their ability to

241
00:13:16.321 --> 00:13:18.180
buy tanks and all these different things.

242
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:21.210
I immediately think that they're going to pay cops less. Right.

243
00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.640
And that's what I think a lot of people think. Cause I, you know,

244
00:13:23.641 --> 00:13:24.960
cause what does defund mean?

245
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:28.560
And so this is what concerns me because like this is anyone, right?

246
00:13:28.561 --> 00:13:31.230
You get underpaid for something that you're really good at. And you're like,

247
00:13:31.231 --> 00:13:34.260
excuse me. So I think that's a really good conversation to have.

248
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:38.640
<v 2>I am open to conservative ideas,</v>

249
00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:43.650
Piper somewhat disagree, Leah agree.

250
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:48.960
Prinav somewhat agree. Benjamin agree, Chris,

251
00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.390
somewhat disagree. Christine.

252
00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.340
<v 5>Strongly agree. There are some conservative ideals that I do respect, right?</v>

253
00:13:56.341 --> 00:14:01.170
Like I think that a lot of what this was down to is not

254
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.620
the issue itself, but the implementation of the issue,

255
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.890
like when I went to go look at the gun laws that, you know,

256
00:14:07.891 --> 00:14:10.560
the Democrat parent candidates are looking at,

257
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:15.000
a lot of candidates are saying that we should, um, ban assault rifles.

258
00:14:15.001 --> 00:14:17.250
And then most of them said that they're not going to buy them back.

259
00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:20.580
And I'm like, okay, so we didn't prohibit this before.

260
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:24.120
So people spent X amount of dollars on this assault rifle and you're not at

261
00:14:24.121 --> 00:14:25.590
least going to buy it back from them.

262
00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:29.220
Another thing I think about is like the social welfare programs. Right.

263
00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.070
Do I think more people should be eligible for it? Yes.

264
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:36.270
Is there any measure on a lot of these programs that get people off of the

265
00:14:36.271 --> 00:14:38.700
system integrated back into the workforce? No.

266
00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.670
So you have people who specifically take advantage of the system and

267
00:14:41.671 --> 00:14:45.330
specifically take care of, take advantage of us as taxpayers.

268
00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:46.890
<v 2>I just, I think in life,</v>

269
00:14:46.891 --> 00:14:51.560
I'm just generally invested in just giving more food land crops, like money,

270
00:14:51.561 --> 00:14:52.040
whatever it.

271
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.680
<v 0>Is. There, there is plenty in the United States,</v>

272
00:14:54.681 --> 00:14:57.500
we have the infrastructure to support everyone in this country,

273
00:14:57.501 --> 00:14:59.690
like significantly more than, than we do currently.

274
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.930
Warren's wealth tax is something that I was really, really in favor of.

275
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:05.780
And it's not something that those people are going to miss. Like it's not like,

276
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.800
like I'm like you're taking their livelihood from them.

277
00:15:09.801 --> 00:15:14.360
You're simply repurposing a part of their livelihood that they're honestly

278
00:15:14.361 --> 00:15:18.260
probably never going to get the opportunity to use in the first place and making

279
00:15:18.261 --> 00:15:21.740
it so that other people can be at least, uh, a Slingshot closer.

280
00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:22.761
So in that respect,

281
00:15:22.761 --> 00:15:27.620
I think like conservative ideology tends to be stingier

282
00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:28.723
if you will.

283
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:33.580
<v 4>What America needs to do more is to compare itself to other countries and like</v>

284
00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:38.200
entities that have similar wealth, like in my political science class,

285
00:15:38.201 --> 00:15:42.610
like we're comparing the United States to the European union countries in the UN

286
00:15:42.611 --> 00:15:43.061
large,

287
00:15:43.061 --> 00:15:47.170
like provide so many more social services to their people and their people are

288
00:15:47.171 --> 00:15:51.280
so much happier and they're the wealth gap in America is

289
00:15:51.281 --> 00:15:53.920
so much greater than it is there.

290
00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:58.420
I'm always willing to hear what the other side has to say,

291
00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.680
but like I'm pretty well versed in politics at this point. And like,

292
00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:07.270
I know that like I honestly don't really agree with any conservative ideals.

293
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:11.200
<v 5>I think for me, there can be like a lot of unlikely allies,</v>

294
00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:15.880
but I think it depends on what the outcome is of that conservative thinking.

295
00:16:15.881 --> 00:16:19.060
Like whether or not I might be opening the listening to it. So like,

296
00:16:19.061 --> 00:16:21.850
if they're like, okay, I really want to stimulate the economy.

297
00:16:21.851 --> 00:16:23.740
We need more jobs. And then the,

298
00:16:23.741 --> 00:16:27.070
how is through green jobs and green infrastructure,

299
00:16:27.071 --> 00:16:29.980
like that's something that could definitely have bipartisan support.

300
00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:34.570
Like I'm talking with a church that is really passionate and really wants to

301
00:16:34.571 --> 00:16:36.700
take a bold stance on climate.

302
00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:40.480
And if I would have just kind of shut them out because they do have some

303
00:16:40.481 --> 00:16:43.060
conservative ideologies, then I feel like, you know,

304
00:16:43.061 --> 00:16:45.940
maybe we wouldn't be able to, I guess, progress.

305
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:50.860
I don't want my ego to get so big where I think that the only way to be is

306
00:16:50.861 --> 00:16:51.670
like me,

307
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:55.450
but that doesn't justify policies that lead to the oppression of other people.

308
00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:59.620
That's another, that's another situation, but I can have empathy for, for them.

309
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:02.350
I believe Joe Biden.

310
00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:06.460
<v 4>We'll win this election. Somewhat agree,</v>

311
00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:11.290
somewhat agree. I agree. But this is me knocking on wood.

312
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.360
<v 0>I agree. Strongly agree, agree.</v>

313
00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:23.260
I am not willing to let the universe think that I believe anything different

314
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:28.450
and I'm not willing to even let the words from my mouth escape to him, courage,

315
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:32.230
any kind of taking away from that outcome. Uh,

316
00:17:32.231 --> 00:17:34.090
when I get super down in the dumps,

317
00:17:34.091 --> 00:17:38.530
I go on Twitter to add Trump underscore regrets and to see posts from people who

318
00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:41.770
are like, I can't believe I voted for you in 2016 and I'm voting for Biden now.

319
00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:42.970
And I'm like, yeah, dude,

320
00:17:42.971 --> 00:17:47.740
just to see like how many people have have defected and to even see the people

321
00:17:47.741 --> 00:17:50.880
who hold themselves accountable in person, like looking now, they're like, Hey,

322
00:17:50.881 --> 00:17:53.040
I thought, I thought maybe something different will be,

323
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.730
would be by switching it up and not sending a politician office in 2016.

324
00:17:56.731 --> 00:18:01.590
I am so sorry. It makes me hopeful. Um, that like in the same way,

325
00:18:01.591 --> 00:18:03.690
like a ton of people have defected from Trump.

326
00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.060
I literally do not see the opposite at all.

327
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:10.350
Like I don't see anyone like who was like previously like Democrat and he's

328
00:18:10.351 --> 00:18:12.780
like, you know what, it. I'm just going to vote for Trump.

329
00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:16.380
Like no one is saying that, which is like, which makes me like very, very,

330
00:18:16.381 --> 00:18:17.220
very happy.

331
00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.170
<v 3>I mean, it's I put some other because like, it depends, like,</v>

332
00:18:21.171 --> 00:18:25.970
it depends on us doing the work behind the scenes. So like make that happen.

333
00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:30.200
Like elections aren't one. Cause like people get complacent. And so like,

334
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:34.100
I don't feel want people to think for a day between now and November 3rd that

335
00:18:34.101 --> 00:18:37.910
like, we can take our foot off the pedal, but people are like, Oh,

336
00:18:37.911 --> 00:18:40.220
Biden is up 15 points nationally. And I'm like, yeah,

337
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:43.460
Hillary was up like five points nationally. And what did that do for her?

338
00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:46.880
Like we have to just keep working to make this happen.

339
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:50.960
It's what's going to be a fight like literally every single day from now until

340
00:18:50.961 --> 00:18:51.794
election day.

341
00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:54.950
<v 6>Hi, y'all.</v>
