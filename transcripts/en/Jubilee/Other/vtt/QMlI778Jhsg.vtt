00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.780
<v 0>Especially when like older male virgins get ridiculed, like, why don't you like,</v>

2
00:00:06.781 --> 00:00:09.750
you know, having a girlfriend or say, why aren't you getting married soon or,

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.570
Oh, you're an insolvent, right?

4
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.700
<v 1>Oral sex counts as losing your virginity. Three,</v>

5
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.280
two, one go.

6
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.470
<v 0>I mean, I believe that we call it oral sex for a reason,</v>

7
00:00:39.471 --> 00:00:43.580
because you get the same benefits from somebody's mouth as you would from

8
00:00:43.581 --> 00:00:46.040
vaginal intercourse. So it is sex.

9
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.760
<v 2>I think I agree with that. Cause it's like growing up that's that's what sex is.</v>

10
00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:52.130
It's right. It's the full, like the whole thing. But that makes sense.

11
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.210
Cause you're getting to the same end goal. So I'm gonna go here. Well,

12
00:00:56.211 --> 00:01:00.410
hearing you all say that it makes me rethink kind of I've just always assumed

13
00:01:00.411 --> 00:01:01.850
it's just penetration. Yeah.

14
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.490
<v 0>That's what I thought too. I mean, for me,</v>

15
00:01:04.491 --> 00:01:09.320
like losing my Virginia means like receiving it through my backend.

16
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.090
You don't know what I'm saying?

17
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.650
That's just like my own personal definition of like what Virginia Beach is.

18
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.290
<v 1>I am afraid of having sex. Three, two,</v>

19
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.570
one, go scary.

20
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.550
<v 0>You said I'm afraid, right? Okay. All right. I'm definitely not afraid.</v>

21
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.700
I'm Mexicano. Wait, wait. You guys are afraid of sex. Uh,

22
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.790
I know my path. I will get married.

23
00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:43.190
I will have sex with my wife and it's going to be great.

24
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.040
I have no fear about that whatsoever.

25
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.160
<v 3>I feel like exposing yourself at your Ross' former to another human being,</v>

26
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.500
who I love, who you love. Yeah. Okay. That's that's true.

27
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.570
But you're not like at all, like even nervous. No.

28
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.930
<v 0>Not at all. I mean, I mean, I'm talking right now,</v>

29
00:01:59.931 --> 00:02:01.850
so I don't know how be in the room,

30
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.010
but like if it's a person who I love and we've dated and we know each other and

31
00:02:06.011 --> 00:02:10.610
we know how we work, communication is key. Um, no, I would be very comfortable.

32
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.940
<v 2>Just in general. I just feel like I'm going to be extremely awkward.</v>

33
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.090
So yeah, I'm a little scared,

34
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.100
but I'm not really scared of losing it to the wrong person because

35
00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:26.090
no matter what I intend for it to be just this monogamous one-time thing.

36
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.580
But I am scared of that person.

37
00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:32.840
Perhaps not being the one that I'm supposed to be with forever for the rest of

38
00:02:32.841 --> 00:02:33.470
my life.

39
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.320
<v 3>I think like a lot of the pressure does come from like porn because it paints a</v>

40
00:02:36.321 --> 00:02:40.370
picture in your mind that play like 90% of the time can't be fulfilled or

41
00:02:40.371 --> 00:02:43.040
satisfied. So if I'm going to be having sex, right.

42
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.330
She expects like iPhone fro 12 max. And all I have is a 12 mini, you know,

43
00:02:47.331 --> 00:02:49.730
like that's, that's what some guys think. Right. And like,

44
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.550
and you feel like you can't live up to those standards because for the most

45
00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:54.050
part, you probably can't it's fake.

46
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.620
<v 2>I heard you whisper. I don't care. And I felt the same way. Like I just,</v>

47
00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.650
I think that the right person wouldn't care,

48
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.280
maybe we just have too much time to think about these things and we put too much

49
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:07.060
pressure on ourselves for whatever reason to look a certain way or act a certain

50
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:10.990
way. And you're going to figure that out when the time is right. So why worry,

51
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.940
why spend your time worrying about that right now?

52
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.370
So maybe I'm a little bit less scared.

53
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.990
<v 0>I'm saving myself for marriage. Three, two,</v>

54
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.910
one go.

55
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.160
<v 2>Saving myself for marriage was something I was taught growing up.</v>

56
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.100
It was something very indoctrinated to my mind. So, you know,

57
00:03:38.101 --> 00:03:40.140
at a young age I made that decision.

58
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.200
I don't want to give that part of me to somebody else.

59
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.880
That's not going to take that journey with them.

60
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.530
<v 0>I think the energy exchange between me and my future wife will just be so</v>

61
00:03:49.531 --> 00:03:53.790
powerful that when we do get married, I'm just waiting for that moment.

62
00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:56.850
And I know that in the future years after that moment,

63
00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.700
it will just be great sex up to grade sex after grade sex,

64
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.060
just because I've waited for that moment. And it's something special to me.

65
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.770
<v 2>So, um,</v>

66
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.120
I haven't been in a relationship and I'm not sure how I would act in a

67
00:04:09.121 --> 00:04:09.960
relationship.

68
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.970
So that's why I'm on the just agree line because I would love to save myself

69
00:04:14.971 --> 00:04:17.550
from marriage. That's what I am aiming for at this point.

70
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.000
But I also haven't dated anybody or been in any relationship.

71
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.470
So I don't know how I'm going to act.

72
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.550
I don't know if that's going to be my first love or what type of pressure is

73
00:04:26.551 --> 00:04:27.840
going to be on me.

74
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.130
So that's why I'm not on strongly agree because I'm still a human and I don't

75
00:04:32.131 --> 00:04:32.964
know.

76
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.350
<v 0>Have many men like asks you out on dates or like tried to date you?</v>

77
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.240
<v 2>Yes, but I usually run away because I'm scared.</v>

78
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.630
<v 0>Like what causes you to run away? Like what's like.</v>

79
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.060
<v 2>I think my mentality when I was young of just being afraid of</v>

80
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.770
men in general, just because I'm getting pregnant where I'm from,

81
00:04:55.771 --> 00:05:00.180
wasn't abnormal at a young age. So I just never wanted that to happen to me.

82
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:01.120
<v 0>Just like her.</v>

83
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.030
I have like zero relationship experience except no one asked me to go

84
00:05:06.031 --> 00:05:06.864
out with them.

85
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.820
Another compelling thing for me on saving my Virginia a marriage is that,

86
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.650
you know, I had an unfortunate occasion on being sexually

87
00:05:16.651 --> 00:05:19.260
mishandled by a girl. Uh, when I was young,

88
00:05:19.261 --> 00:05:22.650
I didn't know back then it was considered, you know,

89
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.720
not good until later on. And it made me very protective, very selective.

90
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.220
<v 2>I used to have that mentality of wanting to meet, wait till marriage.</v>

91
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.920
That was something when I was younger, I just, for some reason,

92
00:05:34.921 --> 00:05:35.790
that's what I wanted to do.

93
00:05:35.791 --> 00:05:39.450
I didn't grow up in a religious home where that was something that was expected

94
00:05:39.451 --> 00:05:42.840
at all. It was just a decision I wanted to make, but I think for me,

95
00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:45.210
it started to evolve into when I feel comfortable,

96
00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:49.230
when I feel at someone that I want to have that experience with, but I don't,

97
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.000
I didn't want it to be this like checkbox that I needed to have filled before I

98
00:05:54.001 --> 00:05:55.290
decided to make that decision.

99
00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.100
<v 0>I enjoy watching porn three, two,</v>

100
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.750
one go.

101
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:11.170
<v 3>Okay. So porn does release a lot of dopamine, so we technically all do enjoy it.</v>

102
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.340
But it's the, after the fact you realized like how, how horrible that was.

103
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.540
You're watching two people have sex through a phone screen and the bathroom.

104
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.990
It's kind of disgusting. I'm on like over a thousand days, no fat.

105
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.910
I haven't watched porn in over a thousand days.

106
00:06:24.911 --> 00:06:28.030
So I was exposed to it at like 10 years old. It's not natural.

107
00:06:28.031 --> 00:06:28.864
It's not healthy at all.

108
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.660
<v 0>Um, I try not to watch it, but when I do watch it, I do enjoy it.</v>

109
00:06:34.661 --> 00:06:39.010
So I have to be honest here. Um, but I really have been trying to do more,

110
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.880
no fat, you know, but I'm just not to a thousand days or anything like that.

111
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.890
<v 3>I mean, I believe watching porn, it's like a private experience. I mean, y'all,</v>

112
00:06:47.891 --> 00:06:51.990
don't like go out and say, Hey, go, Hey, y'all I watch porn and stuff. I mean,

113
00:06:51.991 --> 00:06:56.830
I see watching porn is like an outlet of like my sexual frustration.

114
00:06:56.831 --> 00:06:59.680
Like it helps me maintain my virginity.

115
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.040
<v 2>Cause I haven't had sex myself and experienced that.</v>

116
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:08.260
It's been almost a tool for me to kind of learn and understand how sex

117
00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:12.040
works. Cause I didn't ever have a sex ed class or health or anything like that.

118
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.230
There are different types of porn, right?

119
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.990
Some are like more romantic and natural.

120
00:07:16.991 --> 00:07:20.710
I feel like in some are a little bit crazy.

121
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.150
There's beauty to some that is natural and how it actually would be.

122
00:07:25.151 --> 00:07:26.230
I don't think it's all bad.

123
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:31.240
<v 0>You believe that what you see in the porno videos is actually how people</v>

124
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.410
have sex in real life.

125
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.390
<v 2>No, not in, not in most.</v>

126
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.090
<v 0>I think about having sex a lot, three, two,</v>

127
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.710
one go.

128
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:47.591
<v 2>For a while.</v>

129
00:07:47.591 --> 00:07:51.250
I kind of low key thought something was wrong with me because I never thought

130
00:07:51.251 --> 00:07:53.710
about it at all. It's not something that ever popped up.

131
00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:57.790
I always knew I was a little different because I just never thought about it or

132
00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:01.330
wanted to think about it. I feel the same way actually.

133
00:08:01.331 --> 00:08:04.360
I thought something was wrong too. And then one of my friends was like, well,

134
00:08:04.361 --> 00:08:08.770
maybe you're asexual. And I thought I took it and I was like, is this me? Yeah.

135
00:08:08.771 --> 00:08:10.510
And I kind of took offense to it.

136
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.850
It made me feel like something's wrong with me. You know.

137
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.610
<v 3>I do think about it a lot. Um,</v>

138
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:20.470
but I thought about it a lot more when I wasn't abstaining from like porn and

139
00:08:20.471 --> 00:08:23.920
masturbation. I instead of just thinking about it and just either, you know,

140
00:08:23.921 --> 00:08:26.650
going to place it out by just masturbating obviously,

141
00:08:26.651 --> 00:08:30.280
or going to find a partner to do it with instead I just sit down crisscross.

142
00:08:30.281 --> 00:08:31.480
I literally just meditate.

143
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:35.500
And then I focus on channeling that sexual desire that we're all born with.

144
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.930
And I channeled it into something that actually would benefit me,

145
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.480
like making YouTube videos, working out for me.

146
00:08:40.481 --> 00:08:43.990
I constantly think more about finding the right partner for me buying the right

147
00:08:43.991 --> 00:08:45.310
guy in my relationship.

148
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:49.780
I went through like really bad fallouts with like other people.

149
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.480
I just don't want to feel like I'm just nothing.

150
00:08:52.481 --> 00:08:56.340
I just want to feel like I'm someone to someone's life outside of my family.

151
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:02.250
<v 1>Our culture focuses on women's virginity more than men's</v>

152
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.240
three, two, one go.

153
00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.950
<v 0>I have no idea. No, no. I just, I just, I don't know.</v>

154
00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.790
<v 2>I feel like men are more praised when they're Virgin.</v>

155
00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.580
I feel like people put more attention on them whenever they are a Virgin.

156
00:09:22.581 --> 00:09:25.640
It's a bigger deal. I know growing up, uh, we,

157
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:30.920
the people who I was taught by put a lot of pressure to keep yourself pure or

158
00:09:30.921 --> 00:09:31.754
to, you know,

159
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:36.890
cover yourself as a woman for the sake of men either were seen as

160
00:09:36.891 --> 00:09:41.180
more promiscuous if we do it or we're seen as more prude. If we don't.

161
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:46.190
<v 0>I would S I would counter that by saying for a guy you're seen as like,</v>

162
00:09:46.191 --> 00:09:48.530
what's wrong with you? Like, if you're still a Virgin,

163
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.310
whereas if you aren't a Virgin, it's like, okay, finally, you're, you're,

164
00:09:52.311 --> 00:09:55.530
you're, you're on our team now. You're normal now. So we,

165
00:09:55.531 --> 00:09:59.240
we almost kind of get like, shame. Like, who's that guy, you know,

166
00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:01.910
we'll take a stuff for you, bro. Oh, I think it's that.

167
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:03.350
<v 2>That's true.</v>

168
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:08.120
So women get shamed for sleeping around men get shamed for not exactly

169
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:09.350
that's messed up.

170
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:13.490
<v 0>Well, especially when like older male virgins get ridiculed, like what,</v>

171
00:10:13.491 --> 00:10:15.420
why don't you let you know, having a girlfriend or, Hey,

172
00:10:15.421 --> 00:10:19.730
why aren't you getting married soon or, Oh, you're or you're an insolvent,

173
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:24.620
right? It's just a different dynamic. When it comes to, you know,

174
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:29.580
being ridiculed as a female Virgin compared to like a male version.

175
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.940
<v 1>Being a burgeon is tied to my religion. Three,</v>

176
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.880
two, one go.

177
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.150
<v 2>It is my decision,</v>

178
00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.750
but it is very much tied to my Catholicism and what we're taught about the

179
00:10:47.751 --> 00:10:48.584
sacred,

180
00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:53.660
just the holiness of the body and the soul and the value that your

181
00:10:53.661 --> 00:10:57.500
virginity is not even just, you know, from a strictly biological sense,

182
00:10:57.501 --> 00:11:01.700
but the fact that you're willing to wait and you're willing to put off something

183
00:11:01.701 --> 00:11:03.950
that the world is trying to push on you.

184
00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:07.910
<v 0>Isn't it being a Virgin tied to every religion. Technically they all say like,</v>

185
00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:08.773
no premarital sex.

186
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.930
<v 2>Well, if you're not religious though, then maybe individually,</v>

187
00:11:11.931 --> 00:11:15.380
it's not tied to your beliefs. Yes. I'm not, I'm not religious.

188
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:20.180
I don't go to church as much as I should, but it's my decision.

189
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:21.980
It's not a religion for me.

190
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:25.760
<v 0>The way I see it is is God put us here for a reasons.</v>

191
00:11:25.761 --> 00:11:28.250
And most people don't follow those reasons,

192
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:33.080
but the few who do they are rewarded, um, for, for following the path.

193
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:37.340
So I almost kind of see it as almost kind of like a superpower, uh, that,

194
00:11:37.341 --> 00:11:40.280
that God is like, Hey man, you're on my side. You're doing my work.

195
00:11:40.281 --> 00:11:45.260
You're walking my path. Good work, like, like is going to be what, I mean,

196
00:11:45.261 --> 00:11:49.760
like sex does create new life, right? So if, if you're abstaining from that,

197
00:11:49.761 --> 00:11:51.260
you're not just going to get it to just about anybody.

198
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:54.220
That is a superpower because it's, it's staying within.

199
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.053
<v 3>Your own self.</v>

200
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.730
And if you can learn how to control it and channel that sexual energy through

201
00:11:57.731 --> 00:12:01.300
different, by other means, you can put more work into your school,

202
00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:05.020
into your job, passion hobby, instead of just having it stay as sex, uh,

203
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:05.883
sexual energy.

204
00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:09.900
<v 2>Right. And we'll, and, and, you know, just relying on that, um,</v>

205
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.240
answer as it's my religion, you know,

206
00:12:12.241 --> 00:12:16.200
staying faithful to what you believe in anything,

207
00:12:16.201 --> 00:12:20.040
not just sex is it can be very difficult because we are human, you know,

208
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:24.360
human nature, just because we have the excuse or reasoning of religion,

209
00:12:24.361 --> 00:12:26.040
doesn't make it any easier.

210
00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:27.083
<v 1>For us.</v>

211
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.080
We still say goodbye, but I'm walking.
