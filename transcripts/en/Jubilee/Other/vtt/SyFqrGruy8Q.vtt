00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.060
<v 0>You know, my life is a, is a strange, strange thing.</v>

2
00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:07.740
So there are those who will think that I'm pure evil and that

3
00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:11.610
I am murdering babies and sacrificing goats.

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.000
And I'm not, I like children.

5
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:16.680
I can just never finish a whole one.

6
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.010
<v 1>Some topics are hard to</v>

7
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.910
either the subjects are inaccessible

8
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.300
or people are uncomfortable discussing them.

9
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.940
So we found those subjects and rented a space in Los Angeles and invited our

10
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.630
audiences, strangers to come in and pass them anything.

11
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.220
<v 0>Hello, my name is Richard Leo Lillard.</v>

12
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.110
Richard Lael is one name and I am a psychic clairvoyant.

13
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.850
And I'm here to answer questions on the top.

14
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.490
<v 1>Hello? Hello. I've never spoken with a psychic before.</v>

15
00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.650
Well, maybe you have, you just didn't know it. Yeah, I guess anyone. Yeah.

16
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:01.543
Anyone couldn't be here.

17
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.050
What was like the first moment you realized that you had like a below, you know.

18
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.180
<v 0>Funny question that people ask frequently when I was four, almost five,</v>

19
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.440
my father was dying in the hospital and they, they, they said, uh,

20
00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:17.360
what do you want for your birthday? And I said,

21
00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:19.190
my father is coming home for my birthday.

22
00:01:19.191 --> 00:01:22.940
My father's coming home for my birthday. And everyone went, Oh, you know,

23
00:01:22.941 --> 00:01:26.450
poor kid. He doesn't really understand what's going on.

24
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.180
And then my father came home from my birthday the day of the night, before.

25
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.620
<v 1>My actual birthday.</v>

26
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.850
<v 0>And they said, well, aren't you excited? Your father came home. And I said,</v>

27
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.833
I knew he was.

28
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.500
<v 1>Going to,</v>

29
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.640
can you give me a rundown on what kind of psychic you are and kind of your

30
00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:42.320
abilities? Well.

31
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.140
<v 0>Uh, I use many tools. I use divining rods and I use crystals and I,</v>

32
00:01:47.141 --> 00:01:49.710
I use all kinds of things, but there's a lot of.

33
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.050
<v 1>What kind of people come to you? What type of people are they people</v>

34
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.510
life I have read for every.

35
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.760
<v 0>Religious viewpoints. I've read for wealthy people. I have read for poor people.</v>

36
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.130
I have read for young people and for older.

37
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.790
<v 2>Wait, just to clarify it, you tell fortunes, is that correct?</v>

38
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.590
<v 0>Um, I, I don't like to,</v>

39
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.640
I don't like people to say fortunes because when I'm doing a reading for someone

40
00:02:16.641 --> 00:02:19.910
else, I do not speak in the absolute,

41
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.010
because if I tell you something,

42
00:02:22.011 --> 00:02:26.360
if I tell you there is something that is coming, and if you step to the side,

43
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.600
you're going to miss it. Then it changes the events in the car.

44
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.290
<v 2>What should someone do if they receive a fortune that they don't like?</v>

45
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.300
<v 0>Well, remember, number one, that you are the director of your own movie.</v>

46
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.610
You are the writer of your own novel.

47
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.620
And you can say for the affirmative, I like that. Or for the negative.

48
00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:46.580
I don't like that.

49
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.950
I would also recommend that sometimes I give things to people that I

50
00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:54.440
know they don't want to hear, but I,

51
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.440
I do so because they need to hear it. If they say well that I don't,

52
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:03.250
I don't like that. I don't do it again. Do it again. And I'll tell them, okay,

53
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:05.860
but that's still how it is.

54
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.230
<v 3>So being psychic is a lot about you being in touch with your intuition, so sure.</v>

55
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.480
Do you have daily rituals that you follow?

56
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.370
<v 0>I do. Yeah. I certainly do. The main thing that I do is breathing.</v>

57
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.690
There is a three-part in the breath. When you inhale,

58
00:03:21.691 --> 00:03:26.370
you are taking in newness and freshness. When you pause,

59
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.460
you are forced to focus on the now.

60
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.650
And when you exhale through the mouth,

61
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.350
you are pushing out all of that negative energy.

62
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.130
<v 3>Do you think like everybody, like,</v>

63
00:03:38.131 --> 00:03:41.430
whether it comes to like coincidence or like deja VU, or like,

64
00:03:41.431 --> 00:03:45.330
do you think that there are like abilities that we can all have,

65
00:03:45.331 --> 00:03:46.620
but we just aren't channeling?

66
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.200
<v 0>I believe. Yes. Um, when children, when they, when children are little,</v>

67
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.330
they believe in magic and fairy tales and,

68
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.500
and wizards and ghosts and spirits and all kinds of wonderful things.

69
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.310
And as adults where we tell the children, no, that's not real. No,

70
00:04:02.311 --> 00:04:03.990
that's not real. No, that's not real.

71
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.500
And so by continuing to say those things, it,

72
00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:12.150
it sort of breaks down their ability to,

73
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.790
to open up to those other worlds.

74
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.470
<v 3>So how do you feel about people who use their,</v>

75
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.260
their gift of being psychic to get on TV?

76
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.160
Because sometimes when it reaches TV and becomes a reality TV show,

77
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.610
you start losing the sense of what's real or not,

78
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.150
and there's so much production behind it.

79
00:04:30.151 --> 00:04:32.490
So how do you feel about celebrity psychics?

80
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.120
<v 0>Don't have a problem with celebrity psychics. I have, I am.</v>

81
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.180
I'm very good friends with many of them as humans.

82
00:04:39.181 --> 00:04:43.590
We oftentimes have this sort of judgment against someone who

83
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.460
makes money off of something that they're naturally talented as,

84
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.590
and the altruistic side is beautiful,

85
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.360
but there are bills that have to be paid and television

86
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.970
pays bills. I know from personal experience,

87
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.380
how have your family and friends reacting to you being a psychic? My friends.

88
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.880
It was no surprise when I started. Many of them knew my mother.

89
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.200
My mother is my dearest friend. She's 80 years old. And, um,

90
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.700
she was very, very clairvoyant back in the fifties. People started calling her,

91
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.100
which so we'll openly discuss things that we do, sort of know,

92
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.320
but they refrain like they do with many other aspects of my life. They, they,

93
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.160
my family pretends it's, it doesn't exist. Wow.

94
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.630
How does that affect you personally? As far as the psychic ability goes,

95
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.550
they call it a gift from God. They call it second side, they call it, they,

96
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.230
they, they, they have different names for it.

97
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.280
As far as the more personal aspects of my life, our,

98
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.290
our conversations have gotten to be very, how are you? How's the weather?

99
00:05:52.291 --> 00:05:53.280
How are you feeling?

100
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.530
<v 3>Have you ever felt ashamed for being psychic?</v>

101
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.450
<v 0>Oh, no. Never. No, I don't. I don't ever feel ashamed for it. I don't, I don't,</v>

102
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.860
I don't feel ashamed about anything growing up. I would try to fit in.

103
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.120
I would try so hard and I was weird and skinny and pale with big teeth.

104
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.490
And I had a strange accent and I wore strange suits. I was odd.

105
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.500
And I would, I would try on occasion to be what everyone wanted me to be.

106
00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:22.070
And I would wear the clothes and I would change my voice.

107
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.360
And I was so unhappy. So no, I'm never ashamed of who I am.

108
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.420
<v 1>Yeah, never. No, thank you so much. It was a pleasure. My pleasure,</v>

109
00:06:31.421 --> 00:06:34.150
Margaret. I really think you are a lovely lady. I,

110
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.810
I would like to meet you in person. I think, I think you're, you're,

111
00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.170
you're quite a lovely human being. Thank you. Welcome.
