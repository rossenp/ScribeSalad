1
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.930
<v 0>We brought together seven people who are parents. I'm a parent, I'm a parent,</v>

2
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.890
I'm a parent. I'm.

3
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.230
<v 1>A parent. I'm a parent. I am a parent and I.</v>

4
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.260
<v 0>Am the parent. One of them is a liar.</v>

5
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.340
If the group discovers who the liar is, the survivors win a cash prize.

6
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.190
If the liar survives, they win the prize.

7
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.650
Can the group find the odd man out right now?

8
00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:36.330
My strategy for this game is I actually wrote down some very specific questions.

9
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.130
<v 1>All I know is I'm not trying to get voted out the first round. So.</v>

10
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.320
<v 0>I'm looking to bond with these other parents.</v>

11
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.090
<v 1>I think I'm a really good judge of, uh, who's a parent and who's not.</v>

12
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.700
<v 0>I have no game plan going into this. I'm going to do my best.</v>

13
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.290
I have no idea what I'm doing.

14
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.500
<v 1>All right. We're about to start. Oh,</v>

15
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.950
and the time starts now.

16
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.280
<v 0>Oh, wow. I don't know what you're supposed to do in these first three minutes.</v>

17
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.160
It's it's pretty crazy. Well, hi everyone.

18
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.400
I am a dad. This is like rapid fire,

19
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.020
45.

20
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.910
I'm 43 and chaotic.

21
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.570
I guess this video is kind of gonna be my, uh, I have a two years old daughter,

22
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.240
my reveal.

23
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.220
<v 1>Okay. Okay. I'm 29 and a death.</v>

24
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.350
24 mom.

25
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.900
<v 0>I remember his first poop.</v>

26
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.120
<v 1>I'm the worst typer. They're going to think.</v>

27
00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:56.480
I'm the oldest because I suck at tubing. Oh my goodness. Everyone.

28
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.110
37. I'm expecting sending this number. Oh.

29
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.060
<v 0>Just started. You get used to lots.</v>

30
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.110
<v 1>My friends. Oh, no clip. You haven't told anybody. Oh no.</v>

31
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.900
<v 0>Which is true. Like, and he sits still for it for the very first time,</v>

32
00:02:17.901 --> 00:02:21.950
which is incredible. Uh, before he would just skip all these videos, videos,

33
00:02:21.951 --> 00:02:24.170
videos, videos, videos, and it was driving me insane.

34
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.563
<v 1>Uh.</v>

35
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.540
<v 0>I feel like so much of this is just trying to prove that your not the one</v>

36
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.660
as opposed to sniffing someone out. Um, but I don't know

37
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.580
how old is everyone's kid.

38
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.500
<v 1>My oldest boy is three.</v>

39
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.930
<v 0>No idea. I have no idea.</v>

40
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.733
<v 1>Uh, parents,</v>

41
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.850
uh, say my house is like a kindergarten.

42
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.890
I don't know Johnny. That seems sus sus

43
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.340
Holy crap. This is going so fast.

44
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.990
<v 0>Crystal's favorite toy story character, I guess does that matter?</v>

45
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.790
<v 1>I feel like I should have a notepad</v>

46
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.070
who is single. I'll keep watching, but they're single.

47
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.900
<v 0>I just feel good. I feel good about that round.</v>

48
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.040
<v 1>I felt great about the round. I'm a little suspicious.</v>

49
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.810
I'm not really sure who to vote for. I kinda want to vote for Dyneesha.

50
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.420
Like her responses were very short.

51
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.540
I think I'm going to have to go with Dyneesha. I'm so sorry.

52
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.750
<v 0>Daneesha actually said that I'm definitely a parent.</v>

53
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.380
I think everyone saw that crystal. I'm so sorry,

54
00:04:22.381 --> 00:04:26.490
but I'm probably going to vote for you for this round because you say my

55
00:04:26.491 --> 00:04:29.520
favorite character of toy story is Boulpaep

56
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.040
probably Johnny. I can tell you all about being a parent.

57
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.310
<v 1>Same what?</v>

58
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.100
I'm going to vote for Johnny this round? Uh, mostly because Johnny said,

59
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.010
I can tell you anything about being a parent. And like,

60
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.700
I don't know that Blaine's statement and cockiness.

61
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.870
<v 0>I'm going to vote for crystal.</v>

62
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.810
And that's probably what that's probably what single people are doing.

63
00:04:54.811 --> 00:04:59.040
Non-parents is they're thinking about themselves and not the kid to

64
00:04:59.041 --> 00:05:03.990
Nisha Janisa just has my vote for this one

65
00:05:03.991 --> 00:05:04.824
is the mole.

66
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.120
She spaced her kids out really far.

67
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.590
I have no idea who I'm voting for it and it's around. I know it's not Johnny or,

68
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.490
uh, I think Daniel's, we'll see what happens.

69
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.070
<v 1>I tally the votes and it came out to three way</v>

70
00:05:23.071 --> 00:05:27.600
tie. What the hell? That's insane.

71
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.450
The three way tie was between the Nisha. Johnny

72
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.820
[inaudible] you too is every

73
00:05:41.821 --> 00:05:43.650
study. We'll vote again.

74
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.753
Voting.

75
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.090
<v 0>Why was I voted out?</v>

76
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.231
<v 1>I don't know.</v>

77
00:05:55.231 --> 00:05:58.130
I have a gut feeling about Johnny and I think need to stick with my vote.

78
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.900
<v 0>I got to stick with my gut and go crystal because people</v>

79
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.270
that are parents instinctively say what their kid likes, not what they like.

80
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.720
I think,

81
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.670
I think it's crystal because I go with my gut.

82
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.770
<v 1>The person who was eliminated in our first round is crystal.</v>

83
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:27.520
Sorry. I should've said that. My daughter liked Vokey.

84
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.640
Not that I liked Bo peep though. It's true. I do. She's great

85
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.140
for this round.

86
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:39.640
Tell a brief story about you and your child and the time they overwhelmed you.

87
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.880
It was probably nearing the end of my second pregnancy when I was like nine

88
00:06:42.881 --> 00:06:46.990
months he's he was two at the time and he

89
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.530
decided that he wanted to clog our toilet.

90
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.290
So he just pooped in the toilet,

91
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.480
stuck the whole bunch of toilet paper in the thing flooded that

92
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.290
I walk out he's covered in water. I feel like that's really gross.

93
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.270
<v 0>Um, my kid just gets hyped.</v>

94
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.960
All of a sudden he's three puts his hands on the wall and starts twerking.

95
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:12.040
And then the one-year-old copies what my kid is doing. I was like,

96
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:14.230
where did you learn that from?

97
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.910
And my wife and I always pointing fingers at each other. That's definitely you.

98
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:22.860
Okay. Hi everyone. So real quick. My, when my daughter was four,

99
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.250
she had a very loud voice.

100
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.690
So every single night she screamed so loud for hours that she doesn't want to go

101
00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:32.770
to sleep. And we even tried to put in ear buds and we're like, hold on a second.

102
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.550
Let me try this. There's no difference. She's so loud that we can never.

103
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.990
<v 1>Whenever I do my makeup, I let my daughter use like a lip gloss.</v>

104
00:07:40.991 --> 00:07:45.550
Because one time she took one of the expensive lipsticks that I have and she

105
00:07:45.551 --> 00:07:50.350
called her whole face with it, her whole face. And it was a matte lipstick,

106
00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:51.860
but it was so hard to get.

107
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.240
<v 0>That was teaching my son how to snowboard.</v>

108
00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:00.010
And we ski down into the line and he

109
00:08:00.011 --> 00:08:03.730
shouts out with no reason to no rhyme. Daddy,

110
00:08:03.731 --> 00:08:08.470
I'm going to marry a man and everybody in the crowd heard it and

111
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.390
looks at me and I'm like, good for you, bud.

112
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.050
Whoever you want to marry is who you want to marry. That's my story.

113
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.370
<v 2>Um, gosh, I can't think of a story.</v>

114
00:08:21.371 --> 00:08:25.030
I guess I'll tell you about the story with my 19 year old. Um,

115
00:08:25.031 --> 00:08:29.890
a few months ago he got frustrated with me and he tried to commit suicide

116
00:08:29.891 --> 00:08:32.140
right in front of me. Um,

117
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:37.480
it was really scary and we couldn't call. I was at work.

118
00:08:37.481 --> 00:08:38.680
We couldn't call nine one one.

119
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:42.160
Cause it was during the time where we thought maybe a cop would shoot him if

120
00:08:42.161 --> 00:08:46.330
they went to my house and I didn't know what to do. So,

121
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:51.520
um, it was probably the worst day or worst time of my life.

122
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:55.860
I w I was really scared. And I don't know if any parents got,

123
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.210
have, have experienced this, but it's the worst feeling you could ever feel it,

124
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.610
even throwing it now makes me want to cry.

125
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.390
<v 1>Thank you for sharing.</v>

126
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.790
It looks nice. Getting to see everybody. No idea after that round.

127
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.580
<v 2>When everybody else was talking about that, it was funny and cute.</v>

128
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:19.100
But when it came to my party, it was just right.

129
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:22.490
<v 0>Dinetia story. Oh my goodness.</v>

130
00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:26.750
That was one of the most harrowing things I've heard in a really long time.

131
00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.850
I think I'm going to go Johnny,

132
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:33.560
just because there was some heat on Johnny from the last, from the last boat,

133
00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:38.540
I would probably vote for Daniel just because of the lack of details and the

134
00:09:38.541 --> 00:09:41.400
lack of description. I might just stick with my gut.

135
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.233
<v 2>Sorry.</v>

136
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.590
Johnny seemed like he was telling more of a generic story.

137
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:50.420
<v 1>I'm gonna have to go with Johnny.</v>

138
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.350
I really feel like you should be the one to raise your kid instead of hiring

139
00:09:54.351 --> 00:09:58.450
people to raise your kid. I'm going to put Johnny again. I pick up your girl,

140
00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:03.350
like the second person eliminated from the game

141
00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:08.000
is Johnny. Oh, I'm sorry, John.

142
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.470
<v 0>Ah, I guess I really don't look like a parent.</v>

143
00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:17.450
I should have addressed in like a polo shirt that

144
00:10:17.451 --> 00:10:18.284
sucks.

145
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.320
<v 1>You will have four minutes to talk to each other.</v>

146
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:29.030
And the time starts now, who is the one who said, um,

147
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:32.570
I don't know what to do with a three plus year old. You've got to me. Okay.

148
00:10:32.571 --> 00:10:37.220
So my oldest is a three year old from, um, in July, July six. And,

149
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:39.890
uh, she just loves a lot of Marvel,

150
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.950
like on Disney plus there's like a whole bunch of Marvel stuff that you can

151
00:10:42.951 --> 00:10:47.210
watch. Um, I don't know who was the one no screen time. Was that Johnny?

152
00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.700
That'd be, we already voted him off, right? Yeah. Um,

153
00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:54.980
how old are you? I'm 20.

154
00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:01.970
I had my first, um, I was 20 and I turned 21 when I had him.

155
00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:03.493
Wow.

156
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.830
How you do it as a young cause I was 36, seven,

157
00:11:09.831 --> 00:11:13.130
eight when it all happened and it just, it's a very different ceiling, dude.

158
00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:16.400
I don't know how you guys do. I feel like I'm tired all the time. Like

159
00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:22.340
I think it's just because like, since we're young, we have a lot of energy.

160
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.920
What time to your kids go to bed? Like,

161
00:11:27.921 --> 00:11:30.950
do you guys have a bedtime for your kids? Routine seven.

162
00:11:30.951 --> 00:11:35.030
O'clock in the bath seven and my wife starts at eight.

163
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:39.800
What's the oldest out of all you guys. Cause I think I have the oldest.

164
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:43.640
I think you did the oldest 19.

165
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.750
We voted, voted the Mola. I sort of hear more from you being

166
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:54.370
in daycare or have any of you guys had your kids in daycare? Yeah,

167
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:58.750
but my kids in daycare, my wife's a physician and I work full time.

168
00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:03.130
So like if he wasn't in daycare, he would take all my energy,

169
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.610
like all, every second of myself just to entertain him.

170
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:07.990
So there's no way we can do both.

171
00:12:07.991 --> 00:12:11.740
And we're just like so grateful that our daycare is staying open with a small

172
00:12:11.741 --> 00:12:14.620
amount of kids. And like every parent is just trying to be careful.

173
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.670
I used to work at a daycare, but now I'm a stay at home mom.

174
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:20.820
So like since I've had, not that there's anything wrong with daycares,

175
00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:24.720
but since I've been there, it's like, I kinda know like what goes on.

176
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:29.550
I just rather would spend time with her at home because daycare is expensive.

177
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.870
<v 3>I'm just struggling with what we're going to do with this distant learning or</v>

178
00:12:33.871 --> 00:12:36.600
hybrid learning. But that that's one that one's terrible. Yeah.

179
00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.540
<v 1>Yeah. Our school districts have already emailed us that we're,</v>

180
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:40.463
we're doing it now.

181
00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.560
<v 3>Clarity. I was just doing a hybrid, uh, at a certain point,</v>

182
00:12:43.561 --> 00:12:44.910
starting off with just some learning,

183
00:12:44.911 --> 00:12:47.400
but then they're going to go into a hybrid if we left.

184
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.490
Everybody's really good. Everybody's convincing. They've got their story down.

185
00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:00.270
<v 1>I am the youngest. I'm the youngest. I'm the youngest one on here.</v>

186
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.260
So hopefully they all have that mentality. Like yo,

187
00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.120
she's not the mole.

188
00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.490
I think it was Daniel Dre and Emily that I was kinda concerned about.

189
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:16.080
But cliff seems like he's definitely a parent Daniel. Gosh,

190
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.990
it's almost Daniel and Emily because Emily was talking too much.

191
00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.690
I think I am going to go with Daniel.

192
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:28.110
I wanted more out of him.

193
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.880
And I wonder if he is just a sophisticated

194
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:38.490
man that knows the ropes of parents.

195
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:44.340
Does that make sense? I feel like cliff was right when he said that we,

196
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.380
we thought the mole without police wanted to talk,

197
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:51.120
but if I had to choose someone, it'd probably

198
00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.830
be Emily. I don't know who I'm going to go with.

199
00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:59.460
I might go with Daniel and I go, cliff, I'm going to go with

200
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:05.520
the results of the last round was we had another tie.

201
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.270
The tie is between Daniel and Emily.

202
00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:14.670
So what we're going to actually do for this round is we're going to have

203
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:20.460
each person gets 30 seconds to state their case. Daniel, you go first.

204
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.650
<v 3>All right, did to get this right.</v>

205
00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.690
You shouldn't believe me because I have the adoption certificate to prove it.

206
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:32.670
I have the divorce financial bills to prove that I fought

207
00:14:32.671 --> 00:14:35.250
for custody. Um,

208
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.880
because I have the smartest little monkey trying to make his little Minecraft

209
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:43.290
world on his YouTube channel. And it's a delight.

210
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.280
Uh, I have all of the poop stories. We try to do, uh,

211
00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:52.040
elimination communication early on. Who's actually potty trained by nine, which.

212
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.000
<v 0>Worked until one year. And then it went all to waste. Um,</v>

213
00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.080
unintended jokes galore. I'm definitely.

214
00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:06.100
<v 1>All right. And your time starts now.</v>

215
00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:08.410
Okay. Also Daniel said that he got probate.

216
00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.130
Does it got proof to show that right now? But I do. I'm 22, the Matthew on 20.

217
00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:16.810
My daughter's two. Right? And I have this tattoo right here. 10,

218
00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.130
1970s. It's her birthday. It's her birthday.

219
00:15:21.131 --> 00:15:22.840
Why would I have just have this random tattoo?

220
00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:26.620
Do the math is her birthday 22.

221
00:15:26.621 --> 00:15:31.330
That's the best proof I could show y'all right now. That's all my body. Um,

222
00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.890
I love you. You're so sweet.

223
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:39.760
She's using a tattoo to prove her case,

224
00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:43.390
but I feel like that could have been like a boyfriend, a girlfriend, you know,

225
00:15:43.391 --> 00:15:46.170
no girl, I'm sorry.

226
00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:51.760
<v 0>What do we do here? What do I do think it was a good guy.</v>

227
00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:53.733
Nice person.

228
00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.110
<v 1>Very close, low.</v>

229
00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:02.800
But the next person eliminated is Emily

230
00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:06.771
guys.

231
00:16:06.771 --> 00:16:10.570
So I just got eliminated and I had a feeling I wasn't going to make it to the

232
00:16:10.571 --> 00:16:13.720
last round. If you really think about it. When you think of parents,

233
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:17.830
I feel like people wouldn't put me in that category unless you see my child's,

234
00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.270
um, standing next to me.

235
00:16:19.271 --> 00:16:22.780
And even then my daughter doesn't really look like me cause she's mixed.

236
00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:27.700
So even then people would still think that I am not a parent.

237
00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.490
If the majority decides they've already popped mall,

238
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:35.650
they can go ahead and end the game.

239
00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:39.070
But if the majority feels they haven't caught them all and they want to keep

240
00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.340
going, they can continue the game.

241
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:46.540
<v 0>Oh, I thought this was going to be a lot easier.</v>

242
00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:52.270
Why would they want to continue? We should end the game. I really think that

243
00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:55.300
Emily was a parent.

244
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.033
<v 1>So</v>

245
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:02.410
Neisha and Dre said and the game and desert

246
00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:06.970
continue. If the image I show you is a green,

247
00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:12.040
you've caught the mall and you won. And if the image is red,

248
00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:15.130
the mole is still in the game and you've lost

249
00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:21.310
because I voted to keep going. All right, here we go.

250
00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.710
Three, two, one.

251
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:39.070
[inaudible] I'm going to have them all reveal themselves.

252
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.840
When I count down to one,

253
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:45.400
the mole can raise their hand and reveal it him or herself. Three, two,

254
00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:48.940
one, go ahead and raise.

255
00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:58.490
Here's what's funny. This is the first time I'm seeing crystal really?

256
00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.230
Oh yeah, because if it's from the chat, right,

257
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.730
I'm a horrible typer and I just couldn't keep up.

258
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.010
It's like I had answers to everything.

259
00:18:08.011 --> 00:18:12.540
I have a lovely three and a half year old niece. I just,

260
00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:13.403
I just can't type.

261
00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.530
It's really easy to talk to other parents. It really is.

262
00:18:18.531 --> 00:18:23.240
Especially when you're in a room together and you have to, it was just nice.

263
00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.780
Seeing other people from a different perspective. I was a lot of fun.

264
00:18:26.781 --> 00:18:27.614
It was fun to me,

265
00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:32.180
to people and have a fun little game and diversion in this crazy COVID times.

266
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:35.840
I think the important reminder we always should have is to not judge a book by

267
00:18:35.841 --> 00:18:36.674
its cover.

268
00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:42.230
I definitely wish that I could have learned more from the

269
00:18:42.231 --> 00:18:47.090
parents on here because one day maybe I will be a parent in some

270
00:18:47.091 --> 00:18:47.900
capacity.

271
00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:52.850
And I would've loved to have heard their honest experiences.

272
00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.650
<v 0>Time is so valuable.</v>

273
00:18:54.651 --> 00:18:58.190
So spend it as best as you can with the kids that you have around you.

274
00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:03.380
Everyone can be a parent, but be a good one. Don't raise. No,

275
00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:09.110
we don't need any more of those. What defines a good parents?

276
00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:13.490
I think it's definitely. Oh my goodness. This is the struggle of a parent.

277
00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.900
They never leave. All right. Well there's nothing else to add.

278
00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.980
This has been a fun and great experience. Say bye-bye.

279
00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:23.300
<v 1>Okay.</v>
