13
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.010
I looked up a S Mar farting, just to see.

14
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.630
Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could do it.

15
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.290
<v 0>Yeah, SMR that's been around for a while.</v>

16
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.320
<v 1>Let's get a little bit on the knife. I must begin.</v>

17
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.640
<v 0>It. Places like pop culture and TV</v>

18
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.240
is running down,

19
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.650
but Duke has transformed in recent years.

20
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.000
The dire media full of controversy, intimacy, innovation,

21
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.250
humor, and humanity.

22
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.920
This is spectrum artists.

23
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.290
We invited six artists to see the range of their beliefs

24
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.820
and experiences.

25
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.210
<v 1>Hi guys, my name is April buckles, also known as April SCAs Martin YouTube.</v>

26
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.400
I do fast aggressive. I'm just really weird.

27
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.630
I have two cats and that's about it.

28
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.850
<v 0>Hello everybody. I am Rafi from Rappi dafis ASMR and uh,</v>

29
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.230
I'm just excited to be here. Hey guys. It's bevy. Wait, can I restart?

30
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.700
Okay. Hey guys, it's Mark.

31
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.650
And I have three gaps. I'd like to add that.

32
00:02:36.651 --> 00:02:37.850
I also have one guy.

33
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.480
<v 1>Hello everybody. My name is GB.</v>

34
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.520
I've been making ASR for four years and my channel is GB a SMR. Also,

35
00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:47.570
I'm more of a dog person.

36
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.660
<v 0>My channel is brutality. I enjoy it.</v>

37
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.540
I have no pets. I want a dog.

38
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.270
I am ASMR glow and I'm a big fan of Jubilee.

39
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.780
I'm really excited. I don't have

40
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.730
a SMR. Is sexual

41
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.370
April strongly disagree, Rafi, strongly disagree.

42
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.833
Vivi disagree.

43
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.610
<v 1>GB, strongly disagree.</v>

44
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.150
<v 0>Tala, strongly disagree, glow disagree.</v>

45
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.300
<v 1>ASR, autonomous sensory Meridian response is not sexual.</v>

46
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.850
They did a study on it. People's heart rates, slow.

47
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.810
People are calmer when you are sexually aroused. It is the opposite.

48
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.190
<v 2>Uh, the kind of intimate aspect of ASMR, the whispering,</v>

49
00:03:35.191 --> 00:03:39.420
and it's a very personal one-on-one type of content can sometimes be

50
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.350
mistaken for a sexual, uh, thing, right.

51
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.170
<v 1>To compare it to is, um, when I was younger,</v>

52
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.080
the first ever AMR experience I had,

53
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.330
I was like nine or 10.

54
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.120
And my history teacher was like trying to teach me how to do something.

55
00:03:54.121 --> 00:03:58.170
And the sound of her clicking in the Sanford whispering, mainly had tingles.

56
00:03:58.171 --> 00:04:00.300
I was like, okay, so how could that be sexual?

57
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.720
I like to compare it to like real life massages out of context. You're like,

58
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.920
I'm going to go into a dark room.

59
00:04:04.921 --> 00:04:07.410
And a stranger is going to rub my body when something new,

60
00:04:07.411 --> 00:04:10.020
like that comes up like ASMR. Nobody understands what it is. You're like,

61
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.170
I really like to listen to people, whispered into my ears. People are like,

62
00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:14.100
well, it's gotta be a sex thing.

63
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.180
And also the point that there is going to be erotic ASR,

64
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.490
but that's kind of a no point too,

65
00:04:20.491 --> 00:04:24.450
because there's going to be sexual anything because that's what we do.

66
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.390
It's just like Hollywood, you know, there's like movies.

67
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.710
And then there's like the sexual branch, which is like porn. Does that make the,

68
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.570
the normal movies sexual? No, it's so it's just the same with ASM art,

69
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.410
like sex in general as its own thing. There's nothing wrong with it.

70
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.000
Can you tell my childhood self that? I mean,

71
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.840
I've gotten a lot of this being the one that did your eating and stuff.

72
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.650
I loved mouth sounds and I was so fascinated with the 3d. Oh.

73
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.290
And I was so nervous before that. Cause I had thought about it,

74
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.820
but then I recognized that no matter what videos I was posting,

75
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.650
as long as my face was in there,

76
00:05:01.651 --> 00:05:04.560
or I was in there in some capacity whispering or whatever,

77
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.240
there were going to be sexualized comments saying inappropriate things or

78
00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:11.640
whatever. So I was like, you know what? I'm recognizing that.

79
00:05:11.641 --> 00:05:14.700
So many people love these sounds too, and it's not sexual.

80
00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:16.230
And if I could help them, I was like,

81
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.240
let's just do it and just kind of accepted it and I'm stoked about

82
00:05:21.241 --> 00:05:22.074
it.

83
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.430
<v 2>Yeah. And I think a lot of it too is just people, sexualizing women. Cause, uh,</v>

84
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.480
I can't say that I get many, uh, sexual comments or in my,

85
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.900
in my comment section. Uh, but that's just because I'm a, you know, I'm a guy,

86
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.100
my friends and family think my job yeah.

87
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:43.110
<v 0>Is weird. April strongly disagree. Rafi.</v>

88
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.150
<v 2>Strongly disagree, freebie.</v>

89
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.520
<v 0>Agree. GB, strongly disagree. But Tala agree.</v>

90
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.110
Glo disagree.

91
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.790
<v 1>It took a lot of time for people around me to understand it.</v>

92
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.550
Like my parents, obviously they're from a different generation on top of that.

93
00:06:01.551 --> 00:06:06.470
Anything that's ASMR because it's so new that how do you describe that to

94
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:09.710
someone when they try to watch my videos is just, uh,

95
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.070
me making sounds. But, um,

96
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.870
eventually I saw that it didn't actually matter that they understood what I was

97
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:21.590
doing. They would still support me in whatever I was doing because they saw it,

98
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:23.090
that it was important.

99
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.760
<v 2>When I very first started.</v>

100
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.630
ACMR when I hadn't shared with anyone when I was doing somehow my parents come

101
00:06:28.631 --> 00:06:32.590
across my channel on their own. And I remember my mom and she was,

102
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.220
she literally cried and uh, you know, was very worried about what I was doing.

103
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.520
She completely didn't understand it, but over the years, it's, it's, uh,

104
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.970
they've seen what, you know, what it is. And now it's literally my,

105
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.450
like my dad shows my videos to absolutely everyone. He comes across.

106
00:06:46.451 --> 00:06:49.540
It's probably a little embarrassing, but he's my biggest fan.

107
00:06:49.541 --> 00:06:51.130
And my biggest supporter.

108
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.690
<v 1>In the beginning, I had many interventions from my family saying like,</v>

109
00:06:55.691 --> 00:07:00.280
you need to stop. I don't know what you're doing. But over time, I think after,

110
00:07:00.281 --> 00:07:04.060
especially I started showing them some of these comments, these emails,

111
00:07:04.061 --> 00:07:08.290
these messages that I was getting from people that had PTSD, tinnitus,

112
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.510
they were war heroes. You know,

113
00:07:10.511 --> 00:07:15.010
like it's just from all different walks of life personally thanking me for my

114
00:07:15.011 --> 00:07:19.120
videos. And so my friends and family, I don't think still understand.

115
00:07:19.121 --> 00:07:20.500
And they definitely think it's weird.

116
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:25.450
I think they respect it now because they recognize how passionate I am

117
00:07:25.451 --> 00:07:28.990
about it and how, even though it doesn't really help them,

118
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.460
they can see how a SMR has affected and helped so many people.

119
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.330
<v 2>My dad will reply to comments. My mom will reply to hate comments too.</v>

120
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.890
<v 1>My mom will delete them. Sometimes my mom checks in on me. She's like,</v>

121
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.310
I saw that really mean comment. And you're saying, I'm so sorry. I was like,

122
00:07:45.311 --> 00:07:46.930
mom, what comment? What are you talking about?

123
00:07:46.931 --> 00:07:49.930
I think you've been scrolling for like, I'll tell him, I'm like,

124
00:07:49.931 --> 00:07:51.400
you don't just stole it.

125
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.110
<v 0>Some SMR grosses me out</v>

126
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:01.150
April at CRI Rafi, disagree.

127
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:07.030
<v 1>Somewhat agree. Somewhat disagree, somewhat disagree,</v>

128
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.553
somewhat agree.

129
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.270
<v 2>For the most part, I kind of enjoy a very broad range of ASMR.</v>

130
00:08:13.271 --> 00:08:15.820
I love the mukbang community. I like watching people.

131
00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.640
<v 1>What do you think about sexually SMR? Right?</v>

132
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.320
<v 2>I don't, I don't consume, uh, sexualized smarter. So maybe that,</v>

133
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:25.870
yeah. It's almost like I.

134
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.450
<v 1>It's so hard for me to be judgmental because like people just see something and</v>

135
00:08:31.451 --> 00:08:33.970
they're like ill and I'm like, just relax.

136
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.630
This is doing something for someone somewhere, somehow, whatever.

137
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:41.290
I get muck bugs. Even sexual ASMR. Yeah.

138
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.600
I'm not like a fan of sexual ASMR,

139
00:08:43.601 --> 00:08:45.970
but it's not something that I'm going to watch.

140
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:50.470
Can I ask why does it make you feel uncomfortable? Does it make you, it's not,

141
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.850
it's just not like, um,

142
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:55.950
an effect that I'm trying to like get like watch ASMR for

143
00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:57.150
relaxation,

144
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:01.650
but not like necessarily to get like aroused.

145
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.880
I would just like to clarify the reason I said this was because you hate my

146
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:07.650
finger flutters, toll lighter.

147
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:12.210
I just get very uncomfortable and I'll like click off of it. It's more, um, I,

148
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.770
this one lady was eating live squid, live animal.

149
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:22.020
But most of it, I think it's really cool. No judgment. Like do your thing.

150
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:26.190
I've come across type of ASMR. You know, she was in a dungeon.

151
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:30.810
She had the whips and Oh, you sit down right here. You've been so bad.

152
00:09:30.811 --> 00:09:35.460
Stabbing you to death. AMR is Angelica's videos.

153
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.480
She's like, I'm your period. And she's like, that you're not pregnant.

154
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.910
So she's like taking eggs and like squishing them.

155
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.830
There is a couple of role-plays that like,

156
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.400
they're like roleplays or like that gives me tingles.

157
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.450
I can't do it because it just takes me back to high school. And I'm just like,

158
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.120
I'm trying to relax here. I don't mean to have like,

159
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:58.320
it gives me tingles because I've been watching ASMR for so long that like the

160
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.230
hello, sweetie. Everything's going to be fine. I'm like, I've seen it.

161
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:02.093
I've seen it. I've seen it.

162
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.980
So they're like sitting her ugly down and let me do your makeup

163
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:11.640
though. One time I did look up, okay, this was my fault because I just,

164
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:13.470
I needed to know. I was curious.

165
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.750
I looked up a S Mar farting. See,

166
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:24.420
I clicked on this guy who had like a jar of jam. And it was just like,

167
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.530
I wish you didn't say it. I wish he didn't say it. I looked this up afterwards.

168
00:10:31.531 --> 00:10:32.364
I hope you guys know that.

169
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:37.250
<v 2>I've had to protect myself from some of my viewers.</v>

170
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:43.490
April agree. Rafi, somewhat agree.

171
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:49.400
<v 1>Strongly agree. GB, strongly agree, somewhat agree.</v>

172
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.450
And Glo strongly agree. I need to preface this with that.

173
00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:57.350
99% of my community are angels. And I love them. Like,

174
00:10:57.351 --> 00:11:02.120
it really upsets me that I can't share everything because of the small

175
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:06.770
minority that lately, legitimately, they want to hurt you. I wanted to meet ups.

176
00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:10.340
I want to vlog. And I cannot. And it frustrates me so much the same.

177
00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.810
<v 2>Yeah. People were sharing my app. My, well, it wasn't even my address.</v>

178
00:11:14.811 --> 00:11:18.380
It was my parents' address around online. And um, just, uh,

179
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:21.710
people adding me on my personal Facebook. And uh, it's just,

180
00:11:21.711 --> 00:11:24.200
it feels really invasive and makes me worry. Right?

181
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.300
Cause it's not even my interests floating around there. It's like,

182
00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:30.050
if there's someone who wanted to do harm to my parents and I'm sure, you know,

183
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:33.830
this is something that people tend to target.

184
00:11:33.831 --> 00:11:36.860
I think women more on YouTube than, than guys.

185
00:11:36.861 --> 00:11:40.430
So I don't see it as much and I've never felt unsafe.

186
00:11:40.431 --> 00:11:44.330
So I have a lot of respect for you, ladies that you put yourselves out there.

187
00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:49.640
<v 1>I will say I've talked to like, uh, I have like guy gamer, friends, YouTubers,</v>

188
00:11:49.641 --> 00:11:54.100
and they still experience it. I had a, actually a recent experience.

189
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.370
I recently posted my address by mistake on Instagram.

190
00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:59.740
And it had already had like over 2000 likes,

191
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.710
like I had messed up things that have been coming to my house.

192
00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:07.030
And like Rafi said, it's not my house right now. It's my parent's house.

193
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.970
It's just something, some of the things that you don't, I guess expect,

194
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:11.890
you don't think to look out for things like that.

195
00:12:11.891 --> 00:12:14.470
And I've always came from like a lifestyle where like you can just post

196
00:12:14.471 --> 00:12:17.080
whatever. And only people that are going to see is people in the city.

197
00:12:17.081 --> 00:12:19.540
And I've lived in a very small town. So like everybody know me already.

198
00:12:19.541 --> 00:12:20.680
So what does it matter?

199
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.490
There is a couple few that just love to mess around and they love to, uh,

200
00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:29.020
do what they do. Yeah. I think some people don't even recognize like, Oh,

201
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:33.760
people might see me outside and they're like, Oh my gosh, this is crazy. Like,

202
00:12:33.761 --> 00:12:36.850
can I take a picture and all that? And then I kind of have to say like,

203
00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:41.260
please don't post where like where we are or whatever,

204
00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:46.060
because I've had like very disturbed people that have been

205
00:12:46.061 --> 00:12:50.530
stalking me and I've had to like ramp up my home security.

206
00:12:50.531 --> 00:12:53.260
I've gone and talked to the police. So they know where I am.

207
00:12:53.261 --> 00:12:57.940
Like I've gone to certain extents to make sure that I am

208
00:12:57.941 --> 00:13:01.450
protected. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah.

209
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:06.460
Maybe we're more of a target and then an AMR because it's more

210
00:13:06.461 --> 00:13:07.870
personal, it's more intimate.

211
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:12.130
I've gotten people who kind of put together something in their head and they

212
00:13:12.131 --> 00:13:13.570
think that we're dating.

213
00:13:13.571 --> 00:13:17.680
And so they got really upset that I got a boyfriend and then there's all of

214
00:13:17.681 --> 00:13:20.830
this, you know, that comes from that. Um, for me.

215
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:22.680
<v 3>Being black in general, in the world,</v>

216
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:25.920
we're dealing with a lot of racism throughout my YouTube career.

217
00:13:25.921 --> 00:13:29.610
I've dealt with a lot of using the N word and then going off saying like how I

218
00:13:29.611 --> 00:13:33.150
want you to die. I want you, you're just ugly. You're this, you're this like,

219
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:35.550
it's very prominent. Um,

220
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.850
as a black ASM artist to get those types of comments.

221
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:44.340
<v 1>I'm, I'm kind of in the same spot where I'm Jewish. So I do,</v>

222
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.430
I do read the same kind of, uh, atrocities.

223
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:51.210
It's getting to the point where you're, you're scared to put yourself out there.

224
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:55.350
I literally stopped taking Instagram pictures like outside, because I'm like,

225
00:13:55.351 --> 00:13:59.370
what if the background, you know, like what if they recognize it or whatever,

226
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.450
like this, this green tree, maybe they're going to like pinpoint that.

227
00:14:03.451 --> 00:14:06.870
It's like where I am literally they would,

228
00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:11.880
I find myself really like paying attention to every little detail of what I do

229
00:14:11.881 --> 00:14:12.661
in a day to like,

230
00:14:12.661 --> 00:14:16.380
make sure that I'm not putting my information out there and like,

231
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:21.350
just like protecting my life. It's just, it becomes insane. The SMR.

232
00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.190
<v 0>Unity, lacks diversity, April.</v>

233
00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.140
<v 1>I'm going to say agree. Roughly.</v>

234
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.580
<v 0>Agree, privy, agree, somewhat agree.</v>

235
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:37.170
Batalla agree. And Glo somewhat agree. I'll tell you why.

236
00:14:37.171 --> 00:14:42.030
I said somewhat it's because I watch a lot of ASM artists and there are

237
00:14:42.031 --> 00:14:45.690
so many amazing small creators, every country,

238
00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:49.590
every like age, like you can see, you can find, you can find it now,

239
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.170
but it's really hard to find what is pushed.

240
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.240
<v 1>At the top on YouTube,</v>

241
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.680
especially the top of the isomer community is disturbingly. Non-diverse.

242
00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:00.260
<v 2>One of the things too is we don't see a lot of Malay,</v>

243
00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.070
smartest kind of grow too big, you know,

244
00:15:03.071 --> 00:15:06.970
to the big channel statuses AMR is a kind of an intimate thing for a lot of

245
00:15:06.971 --> 00:15:09.580
people. And some people feel kind of more uncomfortable with, uh,

246
00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:11.350
having that experience with a male. Yeah.

247
00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.700
<v 1>That's so true. But when I saw like Rafi and I got tangled from,</v>

248
00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:16.660
and he just looks like,

249
00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:19.210
I just want to hug you look like you're such like a huggable person.

250
00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:23.140
He had a cat on his mattress and his helix sponsor. And I was like.

251
00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:25.923
<v 2>Thank you.</v>

252
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.640
<v 1>Um, I feel that, um, as a black person,</v>

253
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:35.500
the algorithm of YouTube or just algorithm in life, it's always white.

254
00:15:35.501 --> 00:15:37.660
And then it just trickles down from there. You know,

255
00:15:37.661 --> 00:15:39.580
if I search into to YouTube,

256
00:15:39.581 --> 00:15:42.640
like the first thing you see is just like the white ASM artists.

257
00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:46.150
And I can speak from experience when I have these blue contacts in.

258
00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:48.460
And when I have my hair straightened,

259
00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:52.420
I get way more views than when I had my hair natural with Brown eyes. Yeah.

260
00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:54.730
It's not like they're doing it on purpose. Like, Oh,

261
00:15:54.731 --> 00:15:57.010
I just want to watch a white person today. Or, you know,

262
00:15:57.011 --> 00:15:58.360
I think it's more of just like,

263
00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:02.410
they kind of unknowingly just choose what they're comfortable with.

264
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:06.520
And I feel like ASMR can be more diverse, but it's getting there though.

265
00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:07.923
It's getting there.

266
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.710
<v 2>SMR is my main source of income.</v>

267
00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:17.290
April Rafi, strongly agree. Freebie.

268
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:22.150
<v 1>Agree. GB, strongly agree, strongly agree,</v>

269
00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:27.700
strongly agree. I entered the ASR space, like just the perfect time.

270
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:31.960
And when it made more sense for me to be filming a video than to sit at my

271
00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.000
minimum wage job, I quit my job.

272
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:38.830
I feel like I have the freedom to be making as much content as I'd like for

273
00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:40.090
people. YouTube, vicious,

274
00:16:40.091 --> 00:16:43.480
kind of like a big old question where sometimes we don't really,

275
00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:46.390
we have no contract. We have no nothing. It just is what it is.

276
00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:51.130
<v 2>Zero transparency as to what is, what is acceptable.</v>

277
00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:51.880
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

278
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:56.590
YouTube can be difficult if you put a sounds or wet or these certain

279
00:16:56.591 --> 00:16:59.470
words, you can get monetized and I've dealt with that a lot.

280
00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.530
Would they being your main income? You kind of struggle with flight. Okay.

281
00:17:02.531 --> 00:17:05.800
So should I post this or should I like do something else?

282
00:17:05.801 --> 00:17:08.980
Because what if it gives, do you mind to high? So you never know with YouTube,

283
00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.760
it's so frustrating and they won't, they won't be transparent about that at all.

284
00:17:12.761 --> 00:17:15.340
It's just been very up and down. Whether they like ASMR or not.

285
00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:19.570
There was moments that I felt I was literally like shadow banned on YouTube

286
00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:23.110
because, you know, I was the ear eating girl, but no matter what,

287
00:17:23.111 --> 00:17:28.000
even from that point, it was like, I was, I uploaded a brushing my hair,

288
00:17:28.001 --> 00:17:31.510
video demonetized, and I'm like messaging them.

289
00:17:31.511 --> 00:17:36.190
And I'm getting so upset because like I was month to month and I'm like,

290
00:17:36.191 --> 00:17:40.210
do I get to quit my job or not? Like, I'm, I'm in the middle here.

291
00:17:40.211 --> 00:17:42.880
And I'm just getting so angry in emails.

292
00:17:42.881 --> 00:17:45.190
Like you are messing with people's livelihoods,

293
00:17:45.191 --> 00:17:48.970
not being transparent and not letting me know what is wrong with this.

294
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.790
I'm brushing my hair as ASM artists. We also deal with the,

295
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.790
like the ads. So, you know, when you watch a regular YouTube,

296
00:17:56.791 --> 00:18:00.330
they have like 20 ads and we got to put like one because it's for relaxation and

297
00:18:00.331 --> 00:18:04.140
they want to sleep so that people are still complaining. Why is your ad in here?

298
00:18:04.141 --> 00:18:08.490
Like, okay, you can just like, let me come over here. So we deal with that too.

299
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.340
And I think the reason why I've now said, um,

300
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.550
agree is because the sponsors have like changed my life.

301
00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.440
I stream on Twitch as well.

302
00:18:16.441 --> 00:18:20.640
And I just had an amazing community that was supporting me that way with subs

303
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:22.080
and donors and stuff like that.

304
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.020
I was always making more from Twitch than I was YouTube.

305
00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:28.650
And people would be so surprised with that with like how many subs I have and

306
00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:31.140
how many views these videos are getting. But it's like,

307
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:33.930
I was getting nothing when it comes to money for those,

308
00:18:33.931 --> 00:18:36.660
for those views and stuff. I think there's a lot of people, um,

309
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:37.510
especially subscribed,

310
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:41.970
especially who think that I'm rich and I own like this huge home and I don't,

311
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.110
you know, like I was able to quit my nine to five, but I still do. Like,

312
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:48.900
I work on sets like with like productions in the areas.

313
00:18:48.901 --> 00:18:53.100
I still need that extra money. I'm sitting here like 22, 23 in college.

314
00:18:53.101 --> 00:18:55.080
I really want to move out in order for me to move out.

315
00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:59.060
I can't rely on YouTube right now. A lot of people ask me if, uh,

316
00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:04.340
they should quit their job to do YouTube full-time and

317
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.901
you know,

318
00:19:05.901 --> 00:19:10.190
like knowing all the highs and lows that we've been through on YouTube,

319
00:19:10.191 --> 00:19:13.790
especially with ASMR, YouTube is such a risk. For example,

320
00:19:13.791 --> 00:19:15.890
I don't imagine myself, um,

321
00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:20.750
still being like the content creator that I am right now

322
00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.990
in, uh, I don't know, in five years,

323
00:19:23.991 --> 00:19:28.190
I imagine that people will have forgotten. I have an expiration date. Exactly.

324
00:19:28.191 --> 00:19:31.790
Like younger people will, will come, will be more creative.

325
00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.210
<v 0>Your money, save your dad money. Like we will.</v>

326
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.210
<v 1>Globally disappear is just like,</v>

327
00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.570
it can be sometimes okay.

328
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:46.100
But it can also can be not. Okay. So it's a gamble.

329
00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.160
<v 0>SMR is therapy.</v>

330
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.980
April strongly agree. Rafi agree, freebie,

331
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.100
somewhat agree. GB, somewhat agree.

332
00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:03.380
Batalla somewhat agree and glow angry. But I think with this.

333
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.000
<v 1>Is the word therapy,</v>

334
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:10.490
like I I've never thought that ASMR is like a substitute for getting

335
00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:15.350
therapy with a professional, but is it therapeutic? Yeah.

336
00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:18.980
<v 0>Absolutely strongly agree.</v>

337
00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.790
Don't underestimate real professional therapy.

338
00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:27.170
<v 1>I feel that some people look to ASMR to solve their problems.</v>

339
00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:31.130
And I've gotten comments sometimes where they're upset that this didn't work or

340
00:20:31.131 --> 00:20:34.670
that didn't work. And it's like, I can't really be your therapist.

341
00:20:34.671 --> 00:20:38.630
I'm just trying to relax you and calm you down. You know, I said,

342
00:20:38.631 --> 00:20:40.340
strongly agree because at least for me,

343
00:20:40.341 --> 00:20:45.260
I didn't really need AMR to aid emotional extent until this past

344
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:50.590
summer, when I had just got a breakup, it was six years. I was engaged.

345
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:53.140
It didn't work out. And I just did not want to wake up anymore.

346
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.890
And people used to request like do videos where you say everything's okay and I

347
00:20:56.891 --> 00:20:57.550
never did it.

348
00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:01.600
And now I understand why people just need to hear everything's going to be okay.

349
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:04.000
Like, you're fine. You're beautiful. You can wake up in the morning.

350
00:21:04.001 --> 00:21:04.721
You can go eat.

351
00:21:04.721 --> 00:21:07.450
You can go get dressed because I wasn't doing any of those things.

352
00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:11.710
And I just really needed someone to wake me up and say, okay, April, get up,

353
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.460
get dressed, go eat your breakfast. It's going to be okay.

354
00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:20.070
We also underestimate how important sleep is. Like it ruined my, my,

355
00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:21.250
my life for many years.

356
00:21:21.251 --> 00:21:25.120
I could not sleep because I was so anxious every single night. I just,

357
00:21:25.121 --> 00:21:27.550
the fact that ASR was there for me.

358
00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:31.600
Like I knew when I was making content that it had the potential to affect

359
00:21:31.601 --> 00:21:35.320
people. But even, I didn't know that it would go this far. Yeah.

360
00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:38.530
It's very humbling. Very, very humbling.

361
00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:42.790
I could go forever on this subject.

362
00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:47.740
I'm really pushing for research in the field of ASMR because I have a lot

363
00:21:47.741 --> 00:21:50.620
of people on the autism spectrum in my community.

364
00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:55.240
And one person told me once something that I will always remember,

365
00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:59.380
autistic people, they crave hugs,

366
00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:01.960
but they hate touch and proximity.

367
00:22:01.961 --> 00:22:06.700
So ASMR is giving them some kind of like a compromise. And I've had all,

368
00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:11.140
a lot of people with depression, PTSD, uh,

369
00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:15.850
suicide problems. So many people who told me how ASMR impacted them.

370
00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:19.360
And I think ACMR can help together.

371
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:21.550
Hand-in-hand with a lot of different therapies.

372
00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:25.290
<v 2>Something to consider as well as that for some people and especially younger</v>

373
00:22:25.291 --> 00:22:29.550
people, sometimes therapy, isn't something that's accessible to them. You know,

374
00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:33.210
it is, it is the only form of therapy that they have access to.

375
00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.090
And that's something that I didn't consider when I started my YouTube channel.

376
00:22:36.091 --> 00:22:39.030
I just kind of started it for fun and to make fun sounds.

377
00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.370
Cause I enjoyed watching sound assortments and stuff like that.

378
00:22:41.371 --> 00:22:44.880
And then you slowly realize how many people you are impacting.

379
00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.710
<v 1>I think society nowadays,</v>

380
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:52.080
we lose more and more touch with people. We lose more and more proximity,

381
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.210
especially doing now quarantine.

382
00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:59.250
And I think a SMR sort of brings back like Phil's a little bit

383
00:22:59.251 --> 00:23:01.980
of a void. I want to give everyone a hug.

384
00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:06.210
<v 0>Yeah. Wonderful. That's a wrap guys.</v>

385
00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:07.270
This has been super fun.

386
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:11.220
<v 1>It's really fun. Thank you for putting it together. It's.</v>

387
00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.950
<v 0>Probably you animal people. I want to show you my dog.</v>

388
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:18.270
This is fun.
