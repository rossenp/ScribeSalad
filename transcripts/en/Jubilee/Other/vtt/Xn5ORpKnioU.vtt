I just wanted to tell you that you're at Jubilee are trying to get to know you

5
00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:15.810
you actually care about for 2021.

6
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.250
So make sure you click on the link below and fill out the anonymous survey.

7
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.260
Now let's get into the episode.

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.720
K-pop K-pop 90 million K-pop fans worldwide.

9
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.013
[inaudible]

10
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.660
we truly have the best fans we brought together.

11
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:47.490
Seven K-pop super fans.

12
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.900
<v 1>I'm a K-pop super fan. I'm a K-pop super fan. K-pop super fan.</v>

13
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.940
I'm a K pop super fan. I'm a K-pop super fan. I'm a K-pop super fan.

14
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.620
I am a K-pop super fan.

15
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.790
<v 0>One is a liar. If the group discovers who the liar is, they'll win a cash prize.</v>

16
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.610
If the liar survives, they win the cash prize.

17
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.250
This is odd and out.

18
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.480
<v 1>The mall is either a fan of like one group, but not K-pop as a whole,</v>

19
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.510
or they live with a K-pop super fan.

20
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.310
I'm just going to try and be myself using that.

21
00:01:22.311 --> 00:01:26.630
Can you ask the most basic questions? Like what group are you into?

22
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.410
<v 2>If someone were to say BTS or black pink,</v>

23
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.900
I'm going to be SaaS. All right.

24
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.840
<v 0>All these people who just found out about BTS.</v>

25
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.600
<v 2>There since the beginning, I'm actually so nervous.</v>

26
00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:42.320
Like if you can see my hands, I'm literally sweating right now.

27
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.240
<v 1>I know my stuff, but at the same time,</v>

28
00:01:44.241 --> 00:01:47.300
I feel like I'm going to blank because I don't know anything.

29
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.090
I don't know dates. I don't know the name of your dog.

30
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.830
I I'm not going to make it.

31
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.540
<v 0>What's everyone's old.</v>

32
00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.790
<v 1>So my favorite group is black. So I got my favorite group is.</v>

33
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.540
<v 2>I really like black PCs.</v>

34
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.350
<v 1>Yeah. I love black paint. Their new album. Oh my God.</v>

35
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.600
<v 2>Yeah. So good. Not a bad track on the new album miles card though. Hidden cards.</v>

36
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.980
<v 1>My current favorite group is BTS. My favorite group absolutely is 21.</v>

37
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.080
Oh God. Yes. Yes. Sales come back.

38
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.570
What got everyone into K-pop big bags. It's a big thing.

39
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.840
<v 2>Orange, caramel, orange caramel.</v>

40
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.790
[inaudible] I love orange Kamal. Nano is like my first celebrity.

41
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.690
<v 1>My daughter is in a dance crew. So that's how I, that's how I got into K-pop.</v>

42
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.960
Oh, that's so cool that your daughter. Oh, I got it.

43
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.500
Kind of a sad way. I used to not have a lot of friends.

44
00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:48.140
So on the tray home from high school, I listened to shiny.

45
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.270
I got into K-pop with my best friend.

46
00:02:50.271 --> 00:02:53.420
She had actually moved from South Korea and was like, look at what we got.

47
00:02:53.421 --> 00:02:56.810
And I was like, okay. Yeah. But I really fell into it with shiny with replay.

48
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.680
I was obsessed.

49
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.420
I was supposed to see BTS coming in Chicago from Apple soul. Oh.

50
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.240
<v 3>Wait, are you from Chicago?</v>

51
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.360
<v 1>I'm from Minnesota. But I was going to drive to Chicago for the days.</v>

52
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.630
<v 3>I was supposed to see monster X, but the shutdown was a week before it started.</v>

53
00:03:15.631 --> 00:03:16.800
It was her worst. I was so.

54
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.560
<v 1>Oh, Brown was just very hectic.</v>

55
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.290
Everybody had such good answers and I thought it was going to be obvious.

56
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.220
I dunno. I feel like some of these, these guys are like, Oh, G K-pop fan.

57
00:03:29.221 --> 00:03:32.250
And I'm not because I only got into K-pop a few years ago,

58
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.240
Amy Marni. I'm just going to go. I'm just going to vote for it. Send us.

59
00:03:39.241 --> 00:03:41.880
I'm really sorry. How may I feel like he didn't really have enough time.

60
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.850
<v 2>I'm going to vote for a Troy? I don't know.</v>

61
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.100
I just seems like he was a little bit nervous. Right?

62
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.740
<v 1>She said her daughter is a K-pop fan.</v>

63
00:03:49.741 --> 00:03:52.470
Everything she's learned could be from her daughter.

64
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.870
I feel like that could just be her daughter.

65
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.110
<v 3>Everything seems so picture perfect and set up with like the frames.</v>

66
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.630
And I feel like a fake fan would like do that much.

67
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.500
<v 1>I think I'm just going to have to pick Andrew because for no reason, other than,</v>

68
00:04:04.501 --> 00:04:07.650
I don't know anyone to pick him, my ex-husband's name was Andrew.

69
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.200
<v 4>The votes are in for round one.</v>

70
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.490
And the person that eliminated this round is Frankie.

71
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.560
<v 1>I can't believe this. I'm actually a bit up. I'm upset about being eliminated.</v>

72
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.840
It couldn't be because I was really enjoying this.

73
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.890
I think I'm eliminated because I'm an older fan. Is she eliminated?

74
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.550
I'm in a blank wall and they eliminated her and all her K-pop March.

75
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.923
There was no hope.

76
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.000
<v 4>You will have 10 minutes to search and gather your most prized K-pop related</v>

77
00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:42.834
merchandise.

78
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.210
<v 3>Okay? Okay. I get it. My stuff, God. So much rummaging.</v>

79
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.260
<v 1>Okay. There it goes. The boa shiny album, monster X two pants. XO.</v>

80
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.250
I made t-shirts for super end because I hated the ones that SM in Capitol

81
00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:57.150
records made. It's literally only BTS March though. I'm going to get flamed.

82
00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.990
People have constantly pointed out, like, do you own socks? That aren't K-pop.

83
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.940
<v 2>Oh, Y if you understand my reference,</v>

84
00:05:05.941 --> 00:05:08.850
your actual true K-pop superfan is my door,

85
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.143
my desk drawer.

86
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.140
<v 1>I already had a bunch of my stuff up and ready for us.</v>

87
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.140
I got this album and this is my bias.

88
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.740
<v 3>This is my K-pop box. It's really bad. Normally this is locked.</v>

89
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.060
So here is my sign stack CD like, Hey, Khan, he's billboards.

90
00:05:27.061 --> 00:05:31.110
Here's the love of my life. Tiffany Young, 70 young Kwan.

91
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.470
I went to the Vancouver show. I went to

92
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.990
Tiffany.

93
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.150
<v 2>Here's the thing I support K-pop through iTunes nowadays.</v>

94
00:05:42.151 --> 00:05:46.530
So I'm going to print out what I have on my iTunes.

95
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.540
Not all of us can afford.

96
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.430
<v 1>Okay. Hey guys. So this is my bow at 20th anniversary, large Soju glass.</v>

97
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.720
I love all my life.

98
00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.410
This is my super empty shirt that I had made 21 all my life crushed.

99
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.313
You know what already?

100
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.650
She's an original fan to PM groan. And then lastly,

101
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.460
my NCT one to seven Apple music event. T-shirt I don't know how I got in,

102
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.260
but God saw me. He said, you're going.

103
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.800
And so I went and I saw them and I got this t-shirt at the end.

104
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.950
<v 5>This is actually a convention it's called K-pop North.</v>

105
00:06:17.951 --> 00:06:19.420
And I was actually a volunteer for it.

106
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.580
So I got to meet a bunch of different people.

107
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.850
<v 3>So volunteered at KACO new door. It was so much fun.</v>

108
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.550
<v 5>Every single ICU album, every single black.</v>

109
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.050
<v 1>Oh, this man has takes. Hold on. I'm never going to doubt him in my life.</v>

110
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:33.220
<v 5>The wallet,</v>

111
00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:38.110
I literally have my up and my dad actually thought this was my girlfriend.

112
00:06:38.111 --> 00:06:40.600
And I had to tell him it wasn't so going to buy that.

113
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.080
<v 2>My first item is ran on the wind by card.</v>

114
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.600
I stand far loving to come watch.

115
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.100
I don't have a lot of merchandise because I am a broke college student.

116
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.820
I'm broke. I am going to show you guys.

117
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.780
I support through iTunes like Luna. Didn't go.

118
00:06:58.781 --> 00:07:03.580
Number one for nothing. So I printed like my purchase list.

119
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:04.443
I don't know,

120
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.040
But there's the black PNC I'll dream catcher.

121
00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:14.190
<v 3>That is dedication. Thank you. [inaudible] yes.</v>

122
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.660
Yes. So I have.

123
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.520
<v 1>To sign the albums from GCU and Jenny. So jealous.</v>

124
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.240
I've never seen signed black pink albums. I've no idea how she got that.

125
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.920
I had this VT tell one it's shimmy. I love that.

126
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.600
And then I have so many albums.

127
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.050
<v 2>I'm conflicted with Sundays. She has items,</v>

128
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.350
but they're very mainstream black teen BTS.

129
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.810
<v 3>Okay. I'll try and go fast. Um,</v>

130
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.370
I have every like limited edition BTS members on Joe board for the

131
00:07:45.371 --> 00:07:47.530
cover. I have every single one.

132
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.370
I went to 16 different Barnes and Nobles to get it.

133
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:53.733
<v 1>Absolutely.</v>

134
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.430
<v 2>We stand Barnes and Nobles. K-pop heaven.</v>

135
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.520
<v 1>Oh, wait, am I a fan of it?</v>

136
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.190
<v 3>Three signed months to X albums.</v>

137
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:07.540
<v 1>I've been wearing it since the beginning.</v>

138
00:08:07.541 --> 00:08:12.430
It's one of my most precious things it has BTS is debut day Shirky and

139
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:17.080
tiny shucky, big socks and BTS socks. It will piggy back.

140
00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:20.860
She who is my bias in BTS.

141
00:08:20.861 --> 00:08:25.300
I bet you can't tell on a bunch of BTS albums from all BTS stuff.

142
00:08:25.301 --> 00:08:28.930
So I'm thinking she's just a BTS fan at night. K-pop super fan.

143
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:34.360
<v 3>Seeing people's merchandise definitely helped me seeing people's merchandise to</v>

144
00:08:34.361 --> 00:08:35.320
not help at all.

145
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.060
<v 5>I'm going to vote for Dara.</v>

146
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.450
I think it's just like the fact that her only albums are just from a long time

147
00:08:40.451 --> 00:08:43.600
ago. I feel like she might not be a current fan of K-pop.

148
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:48.610
<v 1>I'm going to vote for Andrew because I think the most obvious one</v>

149
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.260
maybe sometimes could be the most,

150
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.560
I guess I'm just going to vote for Ava this time.

151
00:08:53.561 --> 00:08:57.930
Just because all of her was BTS, but she did have the big socks.

152
00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.100
<v 2>Does. She has a lot of mainstream merchants.</v>

153
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:05.330
<v 3>I feel like she had two things that were great, but that was it.</v>

154
00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.930
<v 1>Wait, no, I'm not going to vote for her. I like her too much.</v>

155
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:13.060
I guess I'd vote for me again. I feel bad.

156
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:18.230
<v 5>We have counted all the votes and the person that eliminated this round is</v>

157
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:21.320
send us cinder.

158
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.990
<v 1>Good. This sucks.</v>

159
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.500
This is very difficult. And I'm so sorry guys.

160
00:09:30.501 --> 00:09:33.080
But the only music video I can think of right now is afterschool bang.

161
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.820
I literally watch this every.

162
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.160
<v 3>Day, Bob, first of.</v>

163
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.460
<v 1>All, afterschool very talented group. They learned things for the music videos.</v>

164
00:09:40.461 --> 00:09:43.490
They did the tap dancing. They did the drums. They did the pole dancing.

165
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:47.330
They had that iconic hip part where they turned, they hit the hips swing, swing,

166
00:09:47.331 --> 00:09:51.550
swing. [inaudible].

167
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.060
<v 2>What came to mind of course is by cards and gunshot their newest release.</v>

168
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.310
It's actually a really big music video.

169
00:09:58.311 --> 00:10:03.290
And it means a lot because this is the last video of them. Four before JSF, uh,

170
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.550
enlist in the military.

171
00:10:04.551 --> 00:10:09.410
They each write about how online words in bullying her idols and

172
00:10:09.411 --> 00:10:14.360
how toxic the fan base can actually be. Hit me like a gun.

173
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.220
Boom, boom.

174
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:19.820
<v 5>[Inaudible].</v>

175
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:24.320
<v 3>No, I'm going to talk about Luna. Mine is UBS new.</v>

176
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.830
So how it works is they all debuted as singular members.

177
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.830
They reverse engineered how, uh, groups are made.

178
00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.770
The whole song is about accepting yourself and being true to yourself.

179
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.640
And there's also a lot of bisexual coding and it was this moment where I

180
00:10:37.641 --> 00:10:39.890
realized Luna was so important. And how,

181
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.270
how important K-pop is in general because K-pop has pushed so many boundaries

182
00:10:44.271 --> 00:10:46.700
and move so many people forward towards really fast.

183
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.230
<v 1>I agree. I don't think CAPOX a leader is sexuality though. I disagree with that.</v>

184
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.470
Okay.

185
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:52.970
<v 2>He has a company are so strict.</v>

186
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.390
It is a rebellious act for a K-pop Fido to go on stage and say,

187
00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.820
I support LGBTQ and they hold up rainbow.

188
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.570
<v 1>So I think my favorite changes literally every year, of course, right now,</v>

189
00:11:02.571 --> 00:11:05.690
it's not shy by it. See, it doesn't have the deepest story,

190
00:11:05.691 --> 00:11:08.120
but I think it's a really fun video. I'm a film major.

191
00:11:08.121 --> 00:11:11.510
So I think people don't really appreciate how hard it is to shoot some of these

192
00:11:11.511 --> 00:11:14.570
videos. They have these insane cut shots. I learned the whole dance.

193
00:11:14.571 --> 00:11:18.890
Like not shy until thing like I can watch when I'm feeling down,

194
00:11:18.891 --> 00:11:21.350
when I'm feeling happy, it like really cheers me up. But yeah.

195
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.040
<v 2>Okay. She, she knows she's a fan. I'm not sophisticated.</v>

196
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.410
<v 5>Afterschool sub unit orange caramel.</v>

197
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.660
I'm specifically talking about the Cadillac and music video.

198
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.610
What I love about it is that they kind of push the boundaries.

199
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.300
They literally dress as sushi. They're literally swimming in soy sauce.

200
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.520
They incorporate comedy into their music videos,

201
00:11:37.521 --> 00:11:39.500
which is not something a lot of members do.

202
00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:46.430
<v 1>It was like, he knows it. I don't know. Truly, truly.</v>

203
00:11:46.431 --> 00:11:48.890
I find it hard to believe that any of these people are the malls.

204
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.590
I think I'm going to go with Andrew again. Everyone had like a unique group.

205
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.110
And then he said, what Darren had.

206
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.430
<v 3>I'm definitely most suspicious of Ava. Now, you know,</v>

207
00:11:59.431 --> 00:12:02.280
she only talked about BTS and then she just mentioned Etsy.

208
00:12:02.281 --> 00:12:04.350
She's only talking about the main level group.

209
00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:08.390
<v 2>Sorry, Andrew much love. I think you're the moment actually. I think I'm going,</v>

210
00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:09.270
if you don't mind.

211
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:12.480
<v 4>I'm sorry, Tara. I love you, Tara. I literally love you.</v>

212
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:16.320
I just feel like Darren just isn't into K-pop as much as she.

213
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:21.360
<v 1>I'm not sure. I think I'm going to vote for Troy just to mix it up.</v>

214
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:28.170
<v 4>And the person eliminated this round is Andrew.</v>

215
00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:29.653
<v 3>I knew it</v>

216
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:37.320
was going bye-bye.

217
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.940
<v 4>And the question is, do you guys want to continue the game?</v>

218
00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.270
If everyone feels confident that you already caught them all,

219
00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:49.050
you can end the game now, but if majority has doubt,

220
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:50.760
the game will continue.

221
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.070
<v 3>I don't know. I don't know.</v>

222
00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.700
<v 1>I don't suspect these people, but I feel like four is like a high number.</v>

223
00:12:56.701 --> 00:12:58.320
You know, guys, I'm exhausted.

224
00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.710
<v 2>What should we do, guys? What do you guys think at home?</v>

225
00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.840
I have still suspicious of Daraa.

226
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.030
<v 1>There's one more question. I just kind of want to get out there.</v>

227
00:13:09.031 --> 00:13:11.340
So I feel like being a K-pop super fan,

228
00:13:11.341 --> 00:13:16.140
like is also recognizing that there are many things wrong in the K-pop industry.

229
00:13:16.141 --> 00:13:18.090
For example, the suicide.

230
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:21.780
I was a huge fan of shiny and I was a really big fan of AOA.

231
00:13:21.781 --> 00:13:26.520
So hearing about the bullying between GMN and Nino was really hard to

232
00:13:26.521 --> 00:13:27.330
hear.

233
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.420
And I was wondering if there's any sides you guys have seen that like you were

234
00:13:30.421 --> 00:13:32.730
willing to work to change within the K-pop.

235
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:37.800
<v 2>I think that SaaS things like are super toxic to be so obsessive and not let</v>

236
00:13:37.801 --> 00:13:39.300
them have their freedom.

237
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.710
The like really crazy like stock green.

238
00:13:43.711 --> 00:13:47.550
It's just crazy to me. And also I'm not an anti fan. I don't like that.

239
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:51.600
I'm not going to go on VTS age or someone pays you just click this slide. Yeah.

240
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.580
<v 1>One thing in particular, um,</v>

241
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:58.290
I'm really big on like cultural appropriation saying

242
00:13:58.291 --> 00:14:03.180
certain wards and things. Like, I really fight about these things. Um,

243
00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:07.290
just because I feel like, you know what you're doing, you just don't care.

244
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:10.140
And that to me says that you don't want me to be your fan.

245
00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:11.820
<v 2>The members from secret code.</v>

246
00:14:11.821 --> 00:14:15.330
I believe she posted black lives matter on her Instagram and her company like

247
00:14:15.331 --> 00:14:20.040
took it down. Did you guys hear about that secret number?

248
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:23.340
<v 3>That's messed up. I do have a really good question for you guys.</v>

249
00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:27.240
Who do you think is responsible for the blowup of K-pop like I know some people

250
00:14:27.241 --> 00:14:30.120
say VTS. I know some people say boa girls' generation.

251
00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.450
<v 1>Okay. I will say boa.</v>

252
00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.340
I remember her dropping did it for love. And I was like, now

253
00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:41.790
what? Like I just blown away.

254
00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:45.180
I feel like BTS got to where they are because these other groups kind of opened

255
00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.780
in a way I'm not suspicious of anyone.

256
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:52.100
I'm probably going to vote for him. Jaime. I knew.

257
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.890
<v 3>A lot. He really understands K-pop Dar is good.</v>

258
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.980
Like there's no doubt in my mind that Dar is not a super fan.

259
00:14:57.981 --> 00:14:59.300
I've known since frickin round table.

260
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.630
So I'm going to have to vote for Ava this round.

261
00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:07.330
<v 6>Okay. We shouldn't have done another round. I'm so sorry. Dari. Like,</v>

262
00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.040
I feel so bad voting for you.

263
00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:12.550
<v 1>Guys. We made a mistake. We're all K-pop stands. This is no,</v>

264
00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:17.440
I don't know why we continued on forgive us. I will vote for,

265
00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:18.873
um.

266
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.350
<v 6>My heart is pounding. You guys I'm so nervous.</v>

267
00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:28.120
<v 4>And the person that eliminated this round is Ava.</v>

268
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.823
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

269
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:37.780
<v 4>We have three people left. Are we going to round five or not?</v>

270
00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:38.740
No.

271
00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.720
<v 1>We definitely caught them all. I'm.</v>

272
00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.340
<v 3>Very competent in this final three weeks.</v>

273
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:46.510
<v 6>I feel you, Troy. I know you.</v>

274
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:53.890
<v 4>So if the color that shows up behind me is green. You all win. If it's red,</v>

275
00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.350
the mole is still in the game and you will.

276
00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.470
<v 1>I'm looking at Jaime right now and you don't mad suspicious right now.</v>

277
00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.290
<v 6>Oh, Martin.</v>

278
00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.050
<v 3>It's not dark. It has to. Behind me.</v>

279
00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.000
<v 6>I knew it was dark.</v>

280
00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:22.173
<v 1>Oh,</v>

281
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:27.580
I know exactly who the mole is. I know it's hi mate.

282
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.610
<v 4>The game is over and the K-pop super fans have lost.</v>

283
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:40.540
That means the mole has won and will be receiving a cash prize.

284
00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:44.950
We're also going to be gifting them all the akin to experience where they will

285
00:16:44.951 --> 00:16:48.400
get to pick their favorite basics from our new interactive apparel brand.

286
00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:53.590
We'll the mole. Please raise your hand in three, two,

287
00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:54.903
one.

288
00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.273
<v 3>Hi guys.</v>

289
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.600
<v 6>[Inaudible] I suspected everyone except you like</v>

290
00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:10.630
[inaudible].

291
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:14.230
<v 3>I'm a music publicist. I've been in the industry for quite a years. Now.</v>

292
00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:18.970
I honestly only know the basics. I couldn't name a single member of BTS,

293
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.920
but I definitely respect you guys. You know,

294
00:17:20.921 --> 00:17:25.900
working as a publicist K-pop would not be what it is today without its fans.

295
00:17:25.901 --> 00:17:28.960
Like did you go to K con as like a publicist? No, I didn't.

296
00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:30.550
Those were my friends, brothers slits that I got.

297
00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:38.980
<v 6>[Inaudible].</v>

298
00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:43.850
<v 1>We literally voted out for super fans and kept them all.</v>

299
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.441
Well,

300
00:17:44.441 --> 00:17:47.770
I guess a true K-pop super fan is honestly someone that's just willing to have

301
00:17:47.771 --> 00:17:50.220
some fun. Someone who loves music, it doesn't.

302
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:54.870
<v 6>Trash other groups. We are all races, all genders, all ages,</v>

303
00:17:55.310 --> 00:18:00.090
and it's really much bigger than most people think. I think for so long,

304
00:18:00.091 --> 00:18:04.680
we've lived in a world where we've treated music and mainstream music,

305
00:18:04.681 --> 00:18:07.890
especially in Western markets is only an English thing.

306
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:12.060
K-pop has literally changed my life.

307
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:14.610
It's given me the excitement back to actually go out and do things.

308
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:15.171
<v 5>You know,</v>

309
00:18:15.171 --> 00:18:19.970
I just used to be so insecure about my ethnicity and who I am as a Korean.

310
00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:20.270
Uh,

311
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:25.040
seeing how popular K-pop has gotten over the 10 years and seeing how many people

312
00:18:25.041 --> 00:18:28.970
are interested in K-pop that's made me proud to be South Korean. So for that,

313
00:18:28.971 --> 00:18:31.040
