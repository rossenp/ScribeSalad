WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.880
<v 0>Yeah, Jason from Jubilee here, and we have a big announcement.</v>

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.740
We're partnering with good to vote,

3
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.280
and we're trying to get a hundred new voter registrations.

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.260
If you help us to hit this goal,

5
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.120
we're going to do one new episode of odd man out with any topic that you guys

6
00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:16.380
help us choose. Uh,

7
00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:19.500
we think that the election is super important and it's really important for all

8
00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:21.810
of us to just be involved with a political process.

9
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.610
We hope to see you out there voting,

10
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:27.870
and we're excited to make a new episode for you fraud man, out for now.

11
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.823
Enjoy the episode.

12
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.300
<v 1>How can you tell if someone is a fifth grader through their knowledge of video</v>

13
00:00:32.301 --> 00:00:35.060
games, TV shows or social media influencers,

14
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.220
maybe it's by how much they know about slime.

15
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.000
Is it through the subjects they might be learning in school or is it just by how

16
00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:44.810
they look? We brought together six, fifth graders.

17
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.640
I am fifth grader.

18
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.410
<v 2>I'm a fifth grader. I am a fifth grader. I am a fifth grader.</v>

19
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.850
I am a fifth grader.

20
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.310
<v 1>And tried something different. On this episode,</v>

21
00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.380
we brought two moles where college kids with no cameras,

22
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.660
can the fifth graders find the odd man out.

23
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.720
<v 2>I feel like the college student is going to have a bigger vocabulary.</v>

24
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.580
And also going to ask if you guys have ticked off,

25
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.910
because I think a lot of people have ticked off at our age to take a college

26
00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:20.930
student. I don't know, we're both tutors.

27
00:01:20.931 --> 00:01:23.390
So we kind of have that little inside scoop.

28
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.530
I don't want to have any suspicions of anyone yet, but that's true to change.

29
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.050
I'm going to go, Hey Gordon,

30
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.370
is that what a child looks at? What is your

31
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.400
face? People just have like 10 questions. I'm a mama, mama, mama,

32
00:01:43.401 --> 00:01:46.880
mom at the mall. Where am I?

33
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.300
If it's a college kid,

34
00:01:50.301 --> 00:01:55.010
I feel like they wouldn't be in school because college is

35
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.710
called to that. Amy misspelled something.

36
00:01:57.711 --> 00:02:01.490
So she can't be coached a lesson. She's trying to art.

37
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.740
I've never seen a fifth grader uses multiple exclamation or

38
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.410
I think I suspect Gordon is typing.

39
00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:13.550
It's all uppercase letters and that's college student typing.

40
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.780
I'm this girl with people who names sound like college names.

41
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.050
It's talking about biology. We haven't stood bales yet.

42
00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:27.860
So I'm not sure about that. Oh, he's interrogating people.

43
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.200
Gordon seems suspicious.

44
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.340
Who said they weren't biology. They're going to Feb.

45
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.050
I think what Kayla is going to get out and Zoe is not

46
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.420
okay. I'm trusting now. Okay. I think we're good. I think that they will be,

47
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.590
I don't know how we're going to read.

48
00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.800
So I'm going to vote for Gordon.

49
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.940
He used writing that I would use in like school.

50
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.960
I'm probably going to vote for McKayla. Okay.

51
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.640
That was a college student names. I don't trust you. College unit.

52
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.970
There's a lot of strong vocabulary or what?

53
00:03:17.971 --> 00:03:21.510
He says his ages Akila, because you know,

54
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.310
she's more suspicious than McKayla because I all edgy and everyone

55
00:03:26.311 --> 00:03:30.420
else was like biology. Cause he said, yeah,

56
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.110
I haven't done that yet. Fifth grade. And I was like,

57
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.640
why would you say in fifth grade,

58
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.190
are you trying to make me think you're in fifth grade.

59
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.501
<v 3>The votes are in.</v>

60
00:03:40.501 --> 00:03:45.180
And we have a tie to the two people with the most votes right now

61
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.460
are Gordon.

62
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.480
<v 2>[Inaudible]. I am doing Gordon again. McKayla, McKayla.</v>

63
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.910
I'm doing boarding again.

64
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.490
<v 3>And the person eliminated this round is</v>

65
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.403
Gordon.

66
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.000
<v 2>They didn't expect that. I probably shouldn't have used as much grammar.</v>

67
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.750
Okay. Charlie Mila. Your favorite YouTuber, if you watch YouTube, of course.

68
00:04:18.751 --> 00:04:23.180
Cause I know not everyone watch it. You choose YouTube.

69
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.350
Let's see what they ask us. Yeah. And then we'll add, I'll ask I'll answer.

70
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.240
I'm nervous. I like noodles,

71
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.600
singles, stranger cheese.

72
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.370
I only get an hour

73
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.890
a day,

74
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.610
four screens an hour,

75
00:04:50.611 --> 00:04:54.600
only four screens through blocks. Don't play road blocks.

76
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.640
But I feel like if I say that,

77
00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.320
they'll think that in the college student I've been really tied up on this chat.

78
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.580
I love robots. I love tech talk.

79
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.990
My favorite show is stranger things. That's

80
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:23.040
my favorite take. Took her. I don't have tic-tac for hours, but more on weekend.

81
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.320
I can stay on for as long as I like. Oh my mom says to get off. I don't know.

82
00:05:28.321 --> 00:05:31.620
I'm going crazy. You guys in this chat, I'm going crazy.

83
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.300
Did you guys know custom plays? You're grounded grabbed it.

84
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.360
You're grounded. You're grounded.

85
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.500
I don't know anything that they're telling me about. Yes.

86
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.740
I love Preston Preston. Oh,

87
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.690
Kristen's like a game. So

88
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.230
hang on here. This is going too fast.

89
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.020
Everyone was spoken about the Mason, roadblocks, Minecraft.

90
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.760
We didn't really answer any tech top questions because we thought their age.

91
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.580
They're not allowed to have to call because you're asleep 13 and older.

92
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.680
I don't know. I just kept saying like, yeah. So funny. Ha ha.

93
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.300
I'm surprised I made it. I think I choose Zoe.

94
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.320
She didn't talk very much. Makeda I'm suspicious of

95
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.050
Sandra because she talks a lot and she just trying to get people to not think

96
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.460
she's talking Micah. He is very, very suspicious.

97
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.400
Okay. The person eliminated this round.

98
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:46.060
McKayla. It doesn't feel good to be eliminated. It's more words.

99
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.100
I don't know how they keep letting her slide. I did not see the name.

100
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.680
This is such a cheesy photo.

101
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.210
It looks a lot like is an emoji. No,

102
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:09.250
it looks like greater. And second of all, it wasn't taken long ago.

103
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:13.270
Amy said, you look so cool. So I said, cool. Oh, Sandra said,

104
00:07:13.271 --> 00:07:18.250
do you play basketball? I said, yes. You can't run over. Like I say guys,

105
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.950
Oh my goodness gracious.

106
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:30.910
Wow, man,

107
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:35.200
that looks like very good quality. So all Sandra's a girl.

108
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.440
If I look at it, like it ease a college student,

109
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:40.540
then I can see it being a college student.

110
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.980
But if I look at it as a fifth grader, I can also see it as a fifth grader.

111
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.580
Nice. That means a lot.

112
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.220
She said so cute. So I need you to live with me. Same type of camera's me. Wait,

113
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.290
what? Use the same type of camera as me. How does he know that? Oh goodness.

114
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:06.310
I don't know. I don't know. No, no, no.

115
00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:08.740
I got, I think it's her.

116
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.150
She's got pink tails are really worn over

117
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:15.880
Amy. I'm going for you.

118
00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.230
[inaudible] yeah, we don't want that to get into that.

119
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:32.830
It's not like a sixth grader though. I'm probably voting Micah for this round.

120
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.550
I'm the only person that my full body in the picture. How

121
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.870
they're definitely going to suspect me or aren't they, I suppose. Nice.

122
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:48.010
You want me to set up you swag?

123
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:55.120
Well, all of them looked like a child. This is going to be a very hard decision.

124
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:59.310
It's Amy. Cause I seen that picture before.

125
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.620
I've seen it somewhere. Micah,

126
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.860
because in his photo he looks very mature.

127
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.950
All of a sudden in her picture.

128
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:12.530
I couldn't really tell whether she was a college student or a fifth grader, Amy.

129
00:09:12.531 --> 00:09:16.280
Because usually when people look back at their old photos, we say do,

130
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:20.930
and that's what she said and why it's not Amy.

131
00:09:20.931 --> 00:09:25.160
Then I don't know. I seen it somewhere.

132
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.800
I've seen it somewhere.

133
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:33.740
<v 3>And the person eliminated on round three is Amy.</v>

134
00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:35.923
Amy.

135
00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:42.830
<v 2>I knew that this was an IVR. And why didn't you say</v>

136
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:49.310
well, now we could have found another picture. Oh my gosh.

137
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:55.970
And a fifth grader because I play with slime. I do roadblocks.

138
00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.950
I ride my scooter. I like fantasy books. And lastly,

139
00:10:00.951 --> 00:10:03.350
because I do ballet,

140
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:08.000
I'm a fifth grader because I just graduated from fourth grade last year and I am

141
00:10:08.001 --> 00:10:08.870
working on double,

142
00:10:08.871 --> 00:10:13.670
double doubles and I love to play Roblox and Minecraft and I love to watch plus

143
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:17.180
in plays and think noodles and Ninjago and Phineas.

144
00:10:17.181 --> 00:10:21.710
And I'm a fifth grader because last year I was in fourth grade,

145
00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.140
my favorite movie is frozen too.

146
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:28.940
And my favorite TV show is avatar. Last Airbender.

147
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.250
If you don't believe me, my class,

148
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.460
my fifth grade classroom number is five three, two, four.

149
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:39.860
I am a fifth grader because I liked to play way too many

150
00:10:39.861 --> 00:10:40.940
video games.

151
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:45.830
I knew way too many classes and I hate them.

152
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:49.040
I hate them with all my heart. Um,

153
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:53.780
teachers said that he has too many classes and I played way too much roadblocks

154
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:57.710
on my computer. She is a fifth grader guys,

155
00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:02.360
my friends, fifth grader right there. We're all fifth graders. We

156
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:14.750
Go for Micah. It's not him, but I'm gonna vote. Prem. Mike has said,

157
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:19.880
I have too many classes and I hate them too many classes

158
00:11:19.881 --> 00:11:21.560
means he's hot with college.

159
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.420
I would choose Micah just because his voice sounds a little bit older than any

160
00:11:26.421 --> 00:11:30.290
of ours. Everyone's voice talent different. It didn't sound like they were like,

161
00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:37.070
[inaudible].

162
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:41.660
<v 3>The person eliminated this round is Micah.</v>

163
00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.430
<v 2>Ooh, really feel bad for Mike.</v>

164
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.880
<v 3>All right. In Zoe and Hollis. Sandra,</v>

165
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.220
give me a thumbs up.

166
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:02.230
If you want to continue the game or give me a thumbs down.

167
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:07.090
If you think you caught the mole and you want to end the game here.

168
00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.440
<v 2>I think we've caught them all. I think we're all fifth graders take.</v>

169
00:12:10.441 --> 00:12:11.274
Everyone's been saying

170
00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:18.600
this is rarely. I'm very, very nervous.

171
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:23.280
<v 3>Okay. Everyone has done thumbs down. You guys have voted. No.</v>

172
00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.160
So we are going to end the game theory.

173
00:12:26.161 --> 00:12:28.770
You guys believe that you guys already caught. The mole.

174
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:37.770
<v 2>Really helped me feeling</v>

175
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.380
and confident. Let's go, come on. Let's do it.

176
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:48.480
<v 3>The box is green. You win. And if the boxes are red,</v>

177
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:53.370
the mall is still in the game and you guys lost. Okay.

178
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.410
In three.

179
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:05.783
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

180
00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:13.290
<v 3>So everyone turned on your cameras in three, two, one.</v>

181
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:25.980
<v 2>[Inaudible] it's Amy. Katie I'm Iris.</v>

182
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:29.753
Wait,

183
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.390
how did you guys know? Do you ever not grammatical at all?

184
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:40.950
It was all because of the picture. The photo you posted. Yeah.

185
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:45.450
Do we look like we're in college? No.

186
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.870
You look like at the end of high school. True younger.

187
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:57.090
I think he was like a year in middle school. Oh, is that a compliment?

188
00:13:57.091 --> 00:14:01.890
Yes. Thanks guys.

189
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:07.410
Something about being special about a fifth grader is,

190
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:13.050
I don't know. It's like the head of the elementary school. You're the top.

191
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.520
We're not too young to be considered a tiny child.

192
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.240
It's basically the midway in life. No.

193
00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:25.500
And say that like 30 years old is the midway, but yeah.

194
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:29.460
Close to like the midway between child and teenager,

195
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:34.470
they were all really funny. A lot of them are very intelligent. I don't know.

196
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.710
It was fun. It was great experience. Obviously want to win,

197
00:14:37.711 --> 00:14:39.750
but I'm glad the kids got money. Yeah.

198
00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:43.320
It seemed like bad college students stealing money from little kids.
