00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>Hey guys, I just watched this video and trust me,</v>

2
00:00:02.491 --> 00:00:05.190
you're going to want to stick around until the end. Also a reminder,

3
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:08.010
if you follow us on Instagram, you can guess who the mole is.

4
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.260
And we put the poll results in the video,

5
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.300
enjoy the episode and remember to vote.

6
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.800
<v 2>How can you tell if someone is an American through their knowledge of American</v>

7
00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:22.070
history and political views, maybe it's by the type of food they eat.

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.150
Is it through their consumption of American pop culture and sports?

9
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.570
Or is it just by how they look? We brought together seven American.

10
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.830
<v 1>I am an American. I'm an American, I'm an American, I'm an American.</v>

11
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.180
I am an American.

12
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.880
<v 2>I am an American one is a liar. If the group discovers who the liar is,</v>

13
00:00:43.881 --> 00:00:48.770
they'll win a cash prize. If the liar survives, they win the cash prize.

14
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.520
Oh,

15
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.390
and by American we're specifically talking about us citizens on this episode,

16
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.220
this is odd man out.

17
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.120
<v 1>So something that makes me an American is I believe America is one of the</v>

18
00:01:02.121 --> 00:01:06.380
greatest countries in the world. I'm American, but by name only.

19
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.240
<v 3>I was born in Hawaii.</v>

20
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.560
So being American is like a totally different context to say, white,

21
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.800
CIS gendered. And those in Ohio, I was born in America.

22
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.380
I've always lived in America and I love my free time.

23
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.080
<v 1>Lived here all my life. I've just lived the stereotypical American experience.</v>

24
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.790
<v 2>I'm related to spot the Lakers.</v>

25
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.130
<v 1>There is no one definition of what an American is.</v>

26
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.980
<v 3>I don't know why I'm so nervous. I'll try. I'm pretty confident.</v>

27
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.380
<v 1>I'm ready to win. I w I want the money.</v>

28
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.790
<v 3>I'm going to type out. H E S L.</v>

29
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.510
<v 1>Let's do it simple. Nice and sweet</v>

30
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.260
on Warren. That was my first question.

31
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.560
Age, sex location, everything lines.

32
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.070
One is 30 and Alex is only 18.

33
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.420
<v 3>And there's another person went from Hawaii. He's also has the same vote, uh,</v>

34
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.470
like math on his emoji. So I met, like, I think maybe later I'm going to like,

35
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.670
be like, okay, maybe what are some Hawaii things you grew up with?

36
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.980
So that'd be interesting, I guess. I dunno,

37
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.220
naturalized as a baby at six weeks old.

38
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.710
Does that even a Kenyan mean naturalized as a baby.

39
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.480
<v 1>Adopted. She just said that,</v>

40
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.830
uh, uh, actually had that for lunch today too.

41
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.550
<v 3>Oh, you're not talking to you. These are all really American chains.</v>

42
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.790
They know doing other stuff. Buffalo, wild wings. Yeah.

43
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.370
<v 1>Oh, Glen's parents are from Nigeria. My parents are actually from Nigeria.</v>

44
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.330
Someone someone's going after Glen, Alex, there we go. 30 seconds.

45
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.000
<v 3>Cause this a sauce. Like if they moved after then, you know,</v>

46
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.700
these rounds are so short.

47
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.093
<v 1>Okay. Well.</v>

48
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.220
<v 2>It seems like everyone is American.</v>

49
00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:10.890
So there's actually another person who's from Hawaii.

50
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.350
<v 4>Sean, we kind of clicked. Cause we're both from Hawaii.</v>

51
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.300
<v 2>Tim is kind of on my list to be like, eh, I'm not. And get it right now.</v>

52
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.070
Alex is coming from me. So I'll kind of give him like a little bit of actual.

53
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.890
<v 4>Oh and who am I going to vote for this route? Oh.</v>

54
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.050
<v 2>I'm probably going to book for Alex.</v>

55
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.830
I think I might vote out Glen for this round. Sophia.

56
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.750
Cause she was naturalized in six weeks. Sorry Glen. It just can't be me.

57
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.740
I think I'm going to vote for 10. I'm going to vote for Glenn.

58
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.300
<v 4>I don't want to vote for Glenn, but I think that's what I'm going to go for.</v>

59
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.040
It just cause I think some other people were gunning for him.

60
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.260
<v 5>The person who eliminated this round is here. It goes.</v>

61
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.270
Yeah. Eliminated. Sorry.

62
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.830
<v 1>I'm pretty sorry. I'm really sorry. But I'm glad it wasn't me.</v>

63
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.670
<v 2>I knew the Nigeria stuff took me out.</v>

64
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.870
<v 5>So round two, this is the American meme route.</v>

65
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.670
So we'll have four minutes to search the internet for the best

66
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.620
American meme you can find. Oh my God. Yes. I'm going to check tumbler.

67
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.680
Your time starts now.

68
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.540
<v 2>I love memes. So I feel like I'll be good at it. Oh, not Trump.</v>

69
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.403
That's too obvious.

70
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.590
<v 4>I got to find something. That'll impress people.</v>

71
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.470
<v 2>I like all the news on Google. Like I don't want to,</v>

72
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.600
I don't want them to think that I'm thinking like,

73
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.940
I think I'm going to go with turducken.

74
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.150
<v 4>Oh wait, wait, where do you go?</v>

75
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.660
<v 5>Let's start with Sean.</v>

76
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.760
<v 2>I feel like Sean's name is stupid. Oh, it's Turkey.</v>

77
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.043
Chicken.

78
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.570
<v 4>You're not gonna lie, Sean. It's pretty like last year. All right.</v>

79
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.890
Let's see what you got me on employee disagrees, caring. Oh God. You did. Okay.

80
00:05:01.891 --> 00:05:03.840
That's a good one. That's a really good one.

81
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.350
Although I wouldn't say cared is like strictly American.

82
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.760
<v 2>That was good. That was good. Mila. What's the male version of Karen.</v>

83
00:05:11.761 --> 00:05:12.594
Is it Keith?

84
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.070
<v 5>Next up is Tim. [inaudible].</v>

85
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.920
<v 4>You call it people liking it. Okay. I was a little worried.</v>

86
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.660
<v 1>What can I say about this meme though? I don't know.</v>

87
00:05:24.661 --> 00:05:28.260
These memes are not a little dry, you know?

88
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.110
<v 4>Oh, I didn't mean to put this in a political thing.</v>

89
00:05:31.111 --> 00:05:32.160
I thought it was funny though.

90
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.670
<v 2>Dad jokes are my specialty.</v>

91
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.910
<v 4>Oh, okay. This is a touchy subject.</v>

92
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.530
<v 1>Are you afraid of white people becoming a minority?</v>

93
00:05:46.531 --> 00:05:50.880
Why are minorities created like second class citizens or something?

94
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.450
Bro. Shots fired.

95
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.620
<v 2>I hope it was good enough, Sean. So.</v>

96
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.720
<v 1>She has someone order</v>

97
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.570
that one's pretty good too.

98
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.750
<v 2>I man, that's pretty American. It's a stereotype.</v>

99
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.480
It's not funny. That's the thing like, come on. We all have funny ones. Like.

100
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.540
<v 1>It must be indigenous people.</v>

101
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.530
<v 2>That must be tough. Ooh. Oh my goodness.</v>

102
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.420
Oh no. Want you to hope for it? I really enjoyed this round. Um,

103
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.750
the memes were all right. They weren't as funny. They just made me kind of sad.

104
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.970
I'm not gonna lie. So the meme that I chose,

105
00:06:36.971 --> 00:06:41.680
I tried to choose something that is like unequivocally without

106
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.190
a doubt. American who has had a turducken. I mean,

107
00:06:45.191 --> 00:06:48.610
I could eliminate him just based off his knee. I think I might go with Mila.

108
00:06:48.611 --> 00:06:53.320
She was very quiet this round. I don't know.

109
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:59.020
I kind of feel like this guy, Alex, he's kind of a, um, a caricature.

110
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.320
I'm not convinced Shawn. I'm gonna vote for Sean.

111
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.760
I'm gonna vote for Alex actually. Last minute change. Last minute change.

112
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:07.780
I'm voting for Alex.

113
00:07:07.781 --> 00:07:12.580
I think I'm going to vote for Sean because a turducken is also Canadian.

114
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.210
I'm wanting to shine. Sorry, Sean. It just can't be me.

115
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:21.340
<v 1>So the votes are in and the person eliminated this round</v>

116
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.140
is Shaw.

117
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.690
<v 2>I'm actually kind of shocked to be honest.</v>

118
00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:32.830
I don't know what I could have done differently. Yeah. you guys,

119
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.620
you guys eliminated an American. What is wrong with you?

120
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.290
Hey everyone. Hi.

121
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.710
<v 3>What are you? Guys' favorite things about being American, I guess?</v>

122
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.610
<v 1>Um, yeah, I'm a very like big.</v>

123
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:56.290
<v 3>First amendment person. So that's good. Yeah.</v>

124
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:02.590
<v 1>I wouldn't say I'm very happy to be an American, to be honest.</v>

125
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:08.080
And I, I actually know a lot of Americans also feel this way that it's like,

126
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.390
it's where I was born. It's where I was raised. But uh,

127
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:15.100
I have no real attachment. It doesn't feel like home. If that makes sense.

128
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.050
<v 3>I'm a libertarian.</v>

129
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:21.580
So I'm super into the first amendment and pretty much most of them.

130
00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:27.280
Um, so freedom is the big thing. But as a libertarian right now is terrible.

131
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.750
Freedoms are being stripped dude. And I think people don't get this,

132
00:08:31.751 --> 00:08:33.940
but libertarians do not like cops.

133
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.380
Like we're not just right-wingers or something. We do not like cops.

134
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:42.820
<v 1>Hmm. I feel like because I'm adopted,</v>

135
00:08:42.821 --> 00:08:46.390
like I was growing up like, and I wanted to fit into that thing.

136
00:08:46.391 --> 00:08:48.190
Like all my friends growing up or way,

137
00:08:48.191 --> 00:08:52.690
like there was no diversity in my little town. I can sort of relate to that.

138
00:08:52.691 --> 00:08:53.530
I'm not adopted,

139
00:08:53.531 --> 00:08:58.230
but I grew up in a very white and so I can relate to wanting to

140
00:08:58.231 --> 00:09:02.910
conform to something that you think is the ideal American.

141
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:03.870
And then when you get older,

142
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:08.790
you kind of realize there is no one definition of

143
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.800
being an American. And I agree with you there.

144
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.100
Cause like we're obviously not perfect right now. Um, but yeah,

145
00:09:14.101 --> 00:09:14.521
like you're saying,

146
00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:16.380
like we can definitely work towards things and that's like the,

147
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:18.360
one of the cool things that I enjoy about being American too,

148
00:09:18.361 --> 00:09:20.670
is that we have the ability to change things like that as well.

149
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.150
I have families with ties and like the black Panthers and everything.

150
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:28.230
And I was never really, I wasn't taught to be proud to be American. I mean,

151
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:30.030
it is what it is. I feel like as Americans,

152
00:09:30.031 --> 00:09:32.280
we should probably be proud of being ourselves first,

153
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:37.110
but then thing of course the individuality and we're all different and yeah.

154
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.640
Is everyone registered the boat?

155
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:39.803
<v 5>Yes.</v>

156
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.930
<v 1>It doesn't require you to register actually. Oh yeah. I know</v>

157
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.930
I haven't voted yet because I just turned 18, but uh,

158
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.780
definitely gonna vote in the election.

159
00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:01.190
<v 2>I honestly have no idea who is not American in this group. If anything.</v>

160
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:03.860
<v 3>Anything's a little harder.</v>

161
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.800
<v 2>Felt like we're still trying to feel each other out.</v>

162
00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.200
<v 3>Think I'm going to vote for, um,</v>

163
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:12.320
Sophia surely because she didn't talk as much.

164
00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:17.090
<v 2>I think I'm just going to vote for Alex because he's the most aggressive this</v>

165
00:10:17.091 --> 00:10:17.361
round.

166
00:10:17.361 --> 00:10:22.010
I think I'm going to vote for Alex because he seems like the most likely to be

167
00:10:22.011 --> 00:10:25.580
the mole to me. I think I'm going to have to go with Lynn. Actually.

168
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:28.610
I just asked if I could change my vote. I feel bad,

169
00:10:28.611 --> 00:10:33.230
but I feel like she didn't give a lot of information in the beginning. I think.

170
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.950
<v 3>I'm going to vote for some here this round. I still got my eyes on you Mila,</v>

171
00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.860
but I'm thinking and so the, uh.

172
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.120
<v 5>No,</v>

173
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.770
the votes are in and the person eliminated this round

174
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.870
is Sophia.

175
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:56.600
<v 2>I played myself with my vote. Like if I had kept it with Alex,</v>

176
00:10:56.601 --> 00:10:59.570
like would he have had other votes? They just knew.

177
00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:02.450
They just knew that I was American. So they had to vote me out.

178
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.160
<v 3>Hey guys, again, I have.</v>

179
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.150
<v 2>A question. I have a question, Alex, how were you?</v>

180
00:11:11.151 --> 00:11:14.690
The one that knew the turducken was from Canada.

181
00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.500
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

182
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:22.250
because I have a lot of Canadian friends and they always went back to their

183
00:11:22.251 --> 00:11:23.750
homes to do turducken,

184
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.320
but I've never had a Thanksgiving with terduk and we just do Turkey.

185
00:11:27.321 --> 00:11:29.570
I've I've heard that like people in America do,

186
00:11:29.571 --> 00:11:32.780
but I think it's more North near, near Canada.

187
00:11:32.781 --> 00:11:35.180
I'm guessing I've only been to Canada once,

188
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.280
so I don't have that much information on it, but yeah.

189
00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:40.220
<v 2>We'll have a lot of Canadian friends.</v>

190
00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.810
<v 3>Uh, DC man. There's a lot of international schools around, you know,</v>

191
00:11:44.811 --> 00:11:46.640
there's waste there's yeah.

192
00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.960
<v 2>Quick question. Quick question. Yeah. Okay. Tim and Alex,</v>

193
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:54.100
you both have been to DC and you know, the.

194
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.240
<v 1>DC area, right?</v>

195
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.190
<v 4>Relative. I've lived there a couple of years.</v>

196
00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:01.960
<v 1>How do you and you claim that there are diplomats children there, right?</v>

197
00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.960
How can you prove that you are not one of them?

198
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.210
<v 3>I've uh, I've lived there for 18 years. Um,</v>

199
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:14.940
and I didn't really live in somewhere where a diplomats live.

200
00:12:14.941 --> 00:12:18.630
Although I knew them because I feel like they're more Northwest. Uh,

201
00:12:18.631 --> 00:12:22.830
and I was more like central, I guess, like downtown, uh, near,

202
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:23.790
near Georgetown.

203
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.880
<v 4>Yeah. So I didn't actually live in DC. I just, my dad worked there. Uh,</v>

204
00:12:26.881 --> 00:12:29.870
we lived in Virginia, so he would commute up there a lot. Like most people do.

205
00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:32.550
<v 3>Whereabouts in Virginia, like Arlington I'm guessing. Right.</v>

206
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.140
<v 4>Uh, I actually lived in Stafford. It's like right by Fredericksburg, you know,</v>

207
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:39.780
that is 30 minutes away. So yeah, he would commute up there. So yeah,

208
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.320
I'd been to the DC area quite a bit. Well, I lived there for a few years. Um.

209
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.830
<v 1>I'm going to vote out Alex.</v>

210
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:51.630
He was just trying to like prove himself a little too much. That's all.

211
00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:55.830
<v 4>I think Alex is pretty safe on me. I think Mila is a little more successive.</v>

212
00:12:55.831 --> 00:12:58.370
Me and Alex. I think the girls are siting together.

213
00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.420
I think the guys decided together, but this is just turning into,

214
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.010
I think I'm going to go with Mila.

215
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.320
<v 1>I am still most suspicious of Alex.</v>

216
00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.010
<v 3>I don't know if that round went as well as the last one.</v>

217
00:13:08.011 --> 00:13:12.090
I felt kind of attacked. Yeah. I'm going to vote off Mila because um,

218
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.530
I think what she's doing is deflecting from.

219
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:19.290
<v 5>The votes are in and we have a tie.</v>

220
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:28.470
What the tie is between Alex and Mila.

221
00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:33.630
So you're going to have 20 seconds to prove to us why you're embarrassed.

222
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.560
<v 1>Okay. This is wild because I don't even care for being an American,</v>

223
00:13:37.561 --> 00:13:38.394
but it is what it is.

224
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:43.080
My family is generations from the same area in California,

225
00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:47.640
literally from Mississippi. Uh, I don't like, I don't know what else to say.

226
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:51.690
That is my, I was born and raised in America.

227
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.780
I know what time.

228
00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:59.940
<v 3>I was born in DC, raised in DC Sibley hospital. That's where I'm born. Uh,</v>

229
00:13:59.941 --> 00:14:02.310
I've got an American flag right there, but I cannot show you that.

230
00:14:02.311 --> 00:14:03.810
I don't think, um,

231
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:07.380
I don't think you find many libertarians outside of the U S I think is pretty

232
00:14:07.381 --> 00:14:11.930
pro you know, American. Um, and I know a lot of international people because my,

233
00:14:11.931 --> 00:14:13.290
my parents worked for the government.

234
00:14:13.291 --> 00:14:16.020
That's why you've got Virginia and New York coming together.

235
00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.520
<v 1>Um, I feel like because I was onto them, they're threatened.</v>

236
00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:22.350
So now they're just like what to vote her out.

237
00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:26.100
<v 3>Hopefully they've got my back and I am, and they won't vote me out.</v>

238
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.010
I'm an American, I promise.

239
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:33.540
<v 1>We got to know more about you other than your libertarian, who was born in.</v>

240
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.990
<v 4>I don't, I'm not really suspicious of anybody. I know for a fact,</v>

241
00:14:36.991 --> 00:14:38.100
Lynn's not going to change her answer.

242
00:14:38.101 --> 00:14:42.900
And Alex and I don't want to do to Alex and dirty like that either. Um.

243
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:48.360
<v 5>The votes are in and the person eliminated on round four</v>

244
00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:51.180
is Alex. Um.

245
00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:57.340
<v 3>Uh, it's a shame. I'm not going to get my money. Nina is on her game though.</v>

246
00:14:57.610 --> 00:14:58.443
Got to give her that.

247
00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:02.590
<v 5>Thumbs up on zoom. If you want to continue to gain, if not,</v>

248
00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.860
you think you've covered them all and want to end the game right now,

249
00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.670
if the color that shows up behind me is green. You all win.

250
00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:19.900
If it's red, the mole is still in the game and you lost.

251
00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.593
<v 1>And sweaty.</v>

252
00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.560
<v 5>In three, two, one.</v>

253
00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:34.773
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

254
00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:41.380
<v 5>The mall can raise your hand and reveal him or herself in three,</v>

255
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:42.850
two, one.

256
00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:45.513
<v 1>I knew</v>

257
00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:56.290
[inaudible]. I voted for Alex for like the past three rounds. I know.

258
00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:00.640
<v 3>You are 100%, right?</v>

259
00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:01.803
<v 1>I'm not American.</v>

260
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.900
I believe we got him.

261
00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.360
We got him all my God.

262
00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.450
That last round was just so important that tie,

263
00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:17.350
if that tie had not have happened, we would've lost.

264
00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.540
<v 3>I memorized the pledge of allegiance.</v>

265
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.340
I should have asked someone to recite that.

266
00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.960
<v 1>I'm really upset. I'll probably regret it forever.</v>

267
00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.110
<v 3>The cast is pretty diverse. They'll have really good perspectives.</v>

268
00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:30.630
It was a lot that goes down.

269
00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:35.020
<v 1>What makes someone American being willing to share your culture with others and</v>

270
00:16:35.021 --> 00:16:36.850
also accepting of other cultures that are here.

271
00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:41.350
<v 3>I love Americans, honestly. I think it has great principals, great values,</v>

272
00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:45.820
even though those values might not necessarily be in practice right now.

273
00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.100
I think Americans the greatest, but obviously not everyone.

274
00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.580
<v 1>You know, I sure felt American when we won.</v>

275
00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.420
I that's the only time I felt American when we won. Oh yeah.

276
00:16:55.421 --> 00:16:57.280
That's the most American I ever felt in my life.
