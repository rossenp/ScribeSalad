<v 0>I've gotta be honest. We can be shallow. A</v>

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.900
Jubilee presents spectrum season five,

3
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.660
episode five blind people.

4
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.960
We invited six blind people to see the range of their beliefs and experiences.

5
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.160
Hey.

6
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.530
<v 1>I'm Alicia and I'm 31.</v>

7
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.550
I live in Toronto currently and I was diagnosed 10 years ago at Stargardt's

8
00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:39.020
disease. I'm Christine ha I'm in Houston, Texas United States.

9
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.740
I'm best known for winning master chef season three. I am James Raff.

10
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.210
I'm legally blind since birth. And I'm currently in Los Angeles, California.

11
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.710
I'm Lacey Edwards. I'm 24 and I'm based in the United Kingdom.

12
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.690
And I'm best named for being the first ever blind presenter on BBC Ray J one.

13
00:00:56.691 --> 00:00:58.100
And I'm also a year cheaper. Yeah.

14
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.550
<v 2>I'm Mario bonds. I'm based in Maryland. I am.</v>

15
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.470
Best-known from season two of the glee project and the PBS documentary blind

16
00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:07.190
love.

17
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.630
<v 1>Hi, I'm Molly Burke. I'm 26 years old in Los Angeles, California.</v>

18
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.890
I have retinitis pigmentosa and I'm a YouTuber motivational speaker and

19
00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:16.724
commercial model.

20
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.560
<v 0>The first prompt is being blind has enhanced my other</v>

21
00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:26.000
senses. Elisha, somewhat agree.

22
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.530
Christine, somewhat agree. James, somewhat agree.

23
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.640
Lucy disagree. Mario strongly agree.

24
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.320
Molly agree.

25
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.710
<v 1>Common to say, Oh, are you dead devil?</v>

26
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.170
And I think I just want to smash this misconception.

27
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.580
We don't have like supersonic over senses.

28
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.190
<v 2>Yes. The misconception that we're somehow superhuman. That drives me nuts.</v>

29
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.700
But I think if I leave out of my house and I've ordered an Uber,

30
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.570
I know my driveway, right. So when I walk out of my house, I'm totally blind,

31
00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:04.340
but immediately my ears say, okay, there's the engine of the car.

32
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.760
I hear the incidental click of the doors unlocking.

33
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.660
And I instantly know where to reach out and grab the door handle.

34
00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:14.480
And of course to the driver, they don't know a blind person just got in there.

35
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.440
<v 1>I said, somewhat agree because it's more so that I pay attention to things more.</v>

36
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.500
So I don't think necessarily that you get heightened senses.

37
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.650
It's more so that you have to depend on your other four senses when you lose

38
00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:31.940
your vision. I said, I agree because, um,

39
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.170
I lost the majority of my vision at 14. I've been legally blind from birth.

40
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.050
Um, and when I lost my vision,

41
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.470
I immediately struggled to adapt to my other senses.

42
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.450
I really struggled with taste. Uh, I had to eliminate things like garlic, onion,

43
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.660
spicy foods. I also struggled with smell a lot.

44
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.920
I distinctly remember being in a restaurant and they burnt cheese and I had to

45
00:02:54.921 --> 00:02:58.190
leave the restaurant. This was the same year I went blind. So for me,

46
00:02:58.191 --> 00:03:02.410
that was like a truly, uh, heightening of my senses,

47
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.230
but things like my hearing and my touch,

48
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.050
I would say are more based on paying more attention.

49
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.470
Next prompt is I prefer to date fellow blind people.

50
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.320
Alicia disagree, Christine. I disagree.

51
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.320
James disagree, Lucy disagree. Mario disagree,

52
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.570
Molly, somewhat disagree.

53
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.690
<v 2>I've been told that I'm a pretty beautiful man.</v>

54
00:03:33.691 --> 00:03:36.570
So I need to have somebody keep telling me that I still have myself together.

55
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.070
It's important people to know that just because we are blind,

56
00:03:41.071 --> 00:03:43.470
doesn't mean that we're automatically going to have a blind partner.

57
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.120
We live in the freedom of love coming in whatever condition or situation.

58
00:03:48.121 --> 00:03:48.954
It may be.

59
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.560
<v 1>Only married to someone who is sighted. And then when I think about it,</v>

60
00:03:52.561 --> 00:03:52.891
I'm like,

61
00:03:52.891 --> 00:03:57.360
life is easier because he can drive me around or tell me if like a certain

62
00:03:57.361 --> 00:04:01.560
ingredient is expired in the pantry. Or tell me if I have food in my teeth.

63
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.530
I said, somewhat disagree. Um,

64
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.880
because I don't prefer to date somebody who is or who isn't,

65
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.750
I'm currently in a relationship with a blind person prior to this.

66
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.290
My partner has only dated sighted women and I've only dated cited men.

67
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.680
I don't care that neither of us can drive because we can still get around.

68
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.970
I don't care that he can't see some of the things that I can't either,

69
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.460
because we can find ways around that. Like using apps,

70
00:04:26.461 --> 00:04:29.370
like be my eyes with my sighted partners in the past,

71
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.840
there was only so much understanding they could have of my lived experience

72
00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:38.370
daily. Whereas every day now I get to come home to a partner that completely

73
00:04:38.371 --> 00:04:40.320
understands my life experience.

74
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.070
Me and Ali have a little bit of a different sort of lift story.

75
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.130
I saw him before I went blind.

76
00:04:47.131 --> 00:04:51.090
I went blind two months into our relationship. So this may sound controversial,

77
00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:54.450
but I feel like he lived my blindness with me.

78
00:04:54.451 --> 00:04:59.070
He felt all of the emotions that I felt as a 17 year old girl,

79
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.180
feeling alone and having this loss and grief.

80
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.560
My sighted partner understands me as

81
00:05:07.561 --> 00:05:11.070
Lucy and understands me as a blind woman,

82
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.470
way deeper than I could ever find in any blind

83
00:05:16.471 --> 00:05:19.140
partner, just because of what we've lived through together.

84
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.320
So we're getting married next year. So, yay.

85
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.323
<v 2>Congratulations.</v>

86
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.820
<v 1>I'd love to ask a followup question to people were curious,</v>

87
00:05:29.821 --> 00:05:33.630
are blind people less shallow about romantic partners?

88
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.480
Oh, love that.

89
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.510
<v 2>I've gotta be honest. We can be shallow a F</v>

90
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.560
One of the first things I'm going to notice is what does your voice sound like?

91
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.540
<v 1>Hair is a massive thing for me. I love when Ali has his hair cut.</v>

92
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:55.500
I love his beard.

93
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.960
<v 2>I noticed the feel of hands the same way a sighted person would notice pretty</v>

94
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:00.794
eyes.

95
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.390
<v 1>Well, smell, smell, smell.</v>

96
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.840
<v 3>Clones, gotta be right. You know how like.</v>

97
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.540
<v 1>Girls are like, are you into arms or abs? Like, I've always been like,</v>

98
00:06:10.541 --> 00:06:11.440
I'm an arms girl,

99
00:06:11.441 --> 00:06:14.740
because it's the first impression I have of a man when he gives me set a guide.

100
00:06:14.741 --> 00:06:18.580
I'm like, but how's that arm hair situation? How's that arm fitness? Like,

101
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.870
what's that like, you know, bicep, like, yeah, I get my full scope of his,

102
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.130
you know, his makeup.

103
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.910
<v 2>And there've been times where, you know, the whole side of her was like, Oh,</v>

104
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:28.420
she doesn't look like she belongs with you,

105
00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:33.160
but I did not care because it's what I found to be attractive both by virtue of

106
00:06:33.161 --> 00:06:37.390
personality and what she felt like to me and everything like that was, was fine.

107
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.350
<v 1>As shallow as my sighted friends, it's just in different ways.</v>

108
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.270
I do still experience physical and sexual attraction like any sighted person

109
00:06:46.271 --> 00:06:51.220
would. And so, yes, I do have preferences of height of hair, um,

110
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.540
of body type.

111
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.050
<v 3>Well, I would say the opposite being legally blind actually,</v>

112
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.830
because I've been going through the degeneration of my eye disease for the last

113
00:06:59.831 --> 00:07:00.490
10 years.

114
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.810
Like I was diagnosed when I was 21 and back then I had different preferences for

115
00:07:04.811 --> 00:07:08.590
what I was looking for. And now my preferences are more lifelong. Like,

116
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.340
is this person going to stay by me as my vision degenerate? And because of that,

117
00:07:12.341 --> 00:07:14.560
I don't look so much at what they look like,

118
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.810
because I can't see them as well as I used to.

119
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.110
But also because I need to know that they match me inside.

120
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.340
<v 1>Unsolicited help makes things hard.</v>

121
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.210
<v 3>I would say somewhat agree. I'm also somewhat agree.</v>

122
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.420
Strongly agree, somewhat agree, somewhat agree.

123
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.590
<v 1>Somewhat agree.</v>

124
00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.960
<v 4>This happened the other day at the mall and especially in a post pandemic world,</v>

125
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:38.651
uh,

126
00:07:38.651 --> 00:07:43.390
I don't necessarily want people getting up in my space and it's hard to sort of

127
00:07:43.391 --> 00:07:46.690
police that as a blind person sometimes, uh, had a security guard,

128
00:07:46.691 --> 00:07:49.900
just literally take hold of me, even know where I was going.

129
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.850
Then I told him and I'm like, I know where I am.

130
00:07:51.851 --> 00:07:53.950
And I just wasn't really comfortable with that scenario.

131
00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:58.150
And then I've had past scenarios where I've actually been literally guided into

132
00:07:58.151 --> 00:08:02.350
traffic. It was kind of a scary scenario and it just all happened so fast.

133
00:08:02.351 --> 00:08:03.880
I really didn't know how to react.

134
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.600
<v 2>I've been in situations where I've actually been cursed out for refusing help.</v>

135
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.210
I'll get the door for you. Oh no, please. Don't I have it.

136
00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:13.000
And I'll get the door for you. Oh no, I'm fine. I'm fine. I have it.

137
00:08:13.001 --> 00:08:14.890
I'll get the door for you. Oh no, I'm fine.

138
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.770
I was just trying to help your blind. Whoa.

139
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.660
It was almost like as if I robbed them of a Cub scout moment, but it's,

140
00:08:21.661 --> 00:08:23.290
it's more of a respect thing.

141
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.380
<v 1>I totally agree with you, Maria. I've got Google maps, um,</v>

142
00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:30.940
in my bone conducting headphones and I'm with Olga, my guide dog, you know,

143
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.320
I know where I'm going.

144
00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.550
There's a lady who stroked Olga as I was crossing the road.

145
00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:40.810
There's cars coming and you're just like, wow, like where am I? What am I doing?

146
00:08:40.811 --> 00:08:44.530
Then obviously Olga's distracted. Then you're a bit off work.

147
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:49.390
And I think the motto here should be just ask, don't grab,

148
00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:53.140
just come up to me and say, you know, you look gloss. I'm Sally.

149
00:08:53.141 --> 00:08:57.060
I'm a passer-by. I was you, you, you look like you need help.

150
00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.980
Do you need any assistance?

151
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:03.450
And then that gives the autonomy back to us and to say actually, yeah, I,

152
00:09:03.451 --> 00:09:07.080
I would really love it. Or actually, no, I don't need help right now. Sorry.

153
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:11.960
<v 3>I chose somewhat agree for a different reason being as I don't look</v>

154
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:15.560
blind. When I look at unsolicited help, I think of it as advice,

155
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:18.320
they tend to give me advice. Like, you know,

156
00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.770
maybe you just shouldn't work because this is too much work for you.

157
00:09:21.771 --> 00:09:24.230
It doesn't boost the morale. It doesn't actually help.

158
00:09:24.231 --> 00:09:28.040
And it actually hinders and makes me feel like you don't see me as capable and

159
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:29.143
inter independent.

160
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:33.860
<v 1>I said, somewhat agree. I don't always know that I need help.</v>

161
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:38.900
So sometimes unsolicited advice or help is actually

162
00:09:38.901 --> 00:09:41.990
really beneficial for me, but overwhelmingly,

163
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.700
I generally will ask for help if I do need it. You know, we have our process.

164
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:49.340
I might have to sit through, you know,

165
00:09:49.341 --> 00:09:51.620
three cycles of traffic at an intersection.

166
00:09:51.621 --> 00:09:54.890
If I've never crossed out that intersection before, but I'm not lost.

167
00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:59.240
I'm just doing what I need to do to be safe and to accommodate my disability.

168
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:03.650
And I think all of us like to have as much independence as much freedom as we

169
00:10:03.651 --> 00:10:06.350
can have. And so sometimes interrupting us,

170
00:10:06.351 --> 00:10:09.050
having independence and freedom can be frustrating.

171
00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:13.040
And it does feel like you're underestimating our ability. I will say though,

172
00:10:13.041 --> 00:10:13.970
that I appreciate it.

173
00:10:13.971 --> 00:10:17.270
If my husband tells me my Cane's about to go into dog poo or something.

174
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.850
Fair enough. Fair enough. Oh yeah.

175
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:25.370
That's my pipe unwanted per the city I live

176
00:10:25.371 --> 00:10:29.330
in is easily accessible for me. Somewhat disagree.

177
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.150
<v 4>Strongly disagree, somewhat disagree.</v>

178
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.200
<v 1>Agree, strongly disagree, somewhat disagree.</v>

179
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.510
<v 4>I spent many years in, um, downtown Los Angeles, which I love,</v>

180
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:46.280
but whenever people needed me to like leave downtown to like go towards the

181
00:10:46.281 --> 00:10:49.760
beach side or go into the Valley or, you know,

182
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:54.200
LA is really big and spread out, then it requires me to figure out, okay,

183
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:59.090
can I combo this between like the Metro and Uber with like the cost of,

184
00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:00.680
and then considering the traffic.

185
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.560
And that's why I'm actually in the process of transitioning my life into a more

186
00:11:03.561 --> 00:11:04.730
accessible city at the moment.

187
00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.340
<v 1>LA is not known for having good public transit.</v>

188
00:11:07.341 --> 00:11:09.200
And it's also just very expensive.

189
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.560
They usually have to purely rely on Uber and Lyft.

190
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:17.210
I've chosen to live in a very walkable area of LA,

191
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.540
which is also very rare. We have the sidewalk braille,

192
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.130
the nice bumps on the sidewalk.

193
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:26.780
All of the crossings near me are either vibrating or tweeting.

194
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:30.620
So for those reasons, yes, my little area is accessible,

195
00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:32.690
but LA as a whole, not,

196
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:35.900
not quite because of what Molly and James said,

197
00:11:35.901 --> 00:11:39.470
I'm going to flip from somewhat disagree to somewhat agree.

198
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:40.850
Being that I live in Toronto.

199
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.550
There's a lot of things that I consider blessings here,

200
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:48.410
but there are things that I need that haven't been thought of.

201
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.550
Because again,

202
00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:54.550
a lot of times when they're trying to be accessible.

203
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:57.790
<v 3>Is still an ideology that doesn't encompass all of us. Like,</v>

204
00:11:57.791 --> 00:12:00.280
I love that when the buses come there's audio announcements,

205
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.640
but sometimes the drivers turn them off and I've gone on the wrong bus and gone

206
00:12:03.641 --> 00:12:06.430
the wrong way for half an hour and then had to wander aimlessly.

207
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.430
And because I can't see street signs, I don't know which way I'm going.

208
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:14.130
<v 1>Yeah. I'm somewhat agree as well, where I'm from in the UK, in London,</v>

209
00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:17.370
we don't have tweeting crossings. So that is so cool.

210
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:22.380
We have a little cylinder at the bottom that sort of moves and spins around.

211
00:12:22.381 --> 00:12:26.460
So we know when to cross, but I think London overall,

212
00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:31.440
I'm really lucky because I have the underground and the into ground it's all or

213
00:12:31.441 --> 00:12:34.230
double overall black cabs are amazing.

214
00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:38.730
Me and the copies have a good old chin wag, uh, they're ever so friendly.

215
00:12:38.731 --> 00:12:42.840
So if you're a friend, London definitely get in a black cab, they're so sweet.

216
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:43.380
I.

217
00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.590
<v 3>I said, strongly disagree. I live in Houston,</v>

218
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.440
which is very much a commuter city.

219
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.440
There are many parts of Houston that have either very terrible sidewalks that

220
00:12:52.441 --> 00:12:55.740
need fixing they're very crooked or they're low hanging branches.

221
00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:57.840
I feel like where there are a lot more pedestrians.

222
00:12:57.841 --> 00:13:01.170
It seems to be more accessible for those who are visually impaired.

223
00:13:01.171 --> 00:13:05.190
Whereas like these wider spreads cities that depend a lot on cars getting to get

224
00:13:05.191 --> 00:13:08.130
around like LA or Houston seems to be less successful.

225
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.410
<v 2>As a blind individual.</v>

226
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:14.190
I ended up paying a fortune when I want to be independent.

227
00:13:14.191 --> 00:13:17.460
I ended up paying a fortune in transportation costs. Um, you know,

228
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.910
I look at it like this at any time I want to leave the, leave the house.

229
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.640
It costs me a coin, so to speak.

230
00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.610
<v 3>And not only is it often, you know,</v>

231
00:13:26.611 --> 00:13:30.660
more expensive to be blind because we do have to pay higher rent to live in

232
00:13:30.661 --> 00:13:35.370
these more accessible neighborhoods and just accessible technology and all of

233
00:13:35.371 --> 00:13:37.170
these extra costs in our lives.

234
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.770
But there are also many blind people live in poverty, um,

235
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:45.360
due to lack of job opportunities. So not only is it more expensive, you know,

236
00:13:45.361 --> 00:13:47.040
we're lower income overall.

237
00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.780
<v 2>Yeah. The, the huge point, you know, 80,</v>

238
00:13:49.781 --> 00:13:52.500
80% of working age blind adults are unemployed.

239
00:13:52.501 --> 00:13:55.350
And as the statistics that have risen steadily since the 1970s.

240
00:13:55.351 --> 00:13:56.400
So that's a really good point.

241
00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:01.800
I am offended when blind is used as one of my descriptive characteristics,

242
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:06.510
disagree, disagree, disagree, disagree,

243
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:08.850
agree, strongly disagree.

244
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:15.270
<v 1>I strongly disagree with this because I think if I was to be offended,</v>

245
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:19.830
that means I'm ashamed and I'm not my blindness is, is yes, just a piece of me,

246
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:21.330
but it is a large piece of me.

247
00:14:21.331 --> 00:14:25.470
And it's a large piece that has informed many of the other pieces of me.

248
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.780
So call me blind.

249
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.780
Cause I am call me short cause I am call me pale because I am,

250
00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:34.800
these are just facts about me. Um, and they don't offend me.

251
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:36.030
They don't upset me.

252
00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:39.330
They're things that I'm proud of and that I wholeheartedly own.

253
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.430
<v 3>I do call myself the blind cook.</v>

254
00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:46.110
People do know me as the blind chef so that I do own that because that is a huge

255
00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.250
part of who I am.

256
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:51.500
But I wouldn't say I strongly disagree because I'm of

257
00:14:51.501 --> 00:14:56.330
situations where I'm introduced at something. And then people say like,

258
00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:00.110
she's a chef. Oh, but she's also blind. Isn't that even more amazing.

259
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.110
I don't want to be put on this other pedestal in spite of me.

260
00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.430
<v 2>Yeah. It's interesting because I, I,</v>

261
00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:09.310
I I'm with Christine that where it's a disagree. I do love it.

262
00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:13.900
That in the bio, the bio blindness is the last thing on the list.

263
00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:18.280
I'm, you know, Mario bonds, 32 year old singer songwriter from Maryland.

264
00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.540
And then you can add,

265
00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.840
he lost his sight to morning glory syndrome at blah-blah-blah.

266
00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:24.760
It's done in a respectable way.

267
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:29.140
<v 3>Disagree because I think being diagnosed at 21,</v>

268
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.220
a lot of who I am was still being a sighted person up until 21.

269
00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.230
And because of that, I have to honor that.

270
00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:40.180
<v 1>It's really important that we're all that out there shouting about the blind</v>

271
00:15:40.181 --> 00:15:44.200
message that we're United and we're owning it because for

272
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:47.560
ages, I didn't want to be blind.

273
00:15:47.561 --> 00:15:52.300
I went blind at 17 and I didn't like the word I lost my

274
00:15:52.301 --> 00:15:54.310
vision and I don't know what to do.

275
00:15:54.311 --> 00:15:57.670
And I'm grieving and there's a loss there and you know,

276
00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:02.170
what are these connotations of this word blind? It's scary. You know,

277
00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:06.040
and I was that girl at school that didn't want to use a cane and didn't want to

278
00:16:06.041 --> 00:16:09.760
own it because there is still a lot of people out there that see the tagline

279
00:16:09.761 --> 00:16:12.730
blind and go, Oh, and you know,

280
00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:17.230
it got a lot easier when I owned my mobility aid and said, right,

281
00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.590
I am coming out as blind to the world. And in turn,

282
00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:24.040
I'm coming out as my self I'm liberated, I'm free.

283
00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:25.630
And this is me.

284
00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:30.010
And it just felt like you were breathing a sigh of relief being blind.

285
00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:34.600
<v 3>It's affected my mental health. Strongly agree, strongly agree.</v>

286
00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:39.040
<v 4>Somewhat disagree, strongly agree, strongly agree.</v>

287
00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:40.180
<v 3>Strongly agree.</v>

288
00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:46.630
<v 4>So having been born legally blind, I never knew anything different.</v>

289
00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:50.710
It wasn't until the kids become more aware and stuff and poke out differences

290
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:55.780
and, and really nag on those that that's when I really had that whole

291
00:16:55.781 --> 00:16:58.420
journey of, uh, my mental health and,

292
00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:01.660
and being diagnosed with mental illnesses and stuff. But that really,

293
00:17:01.661 --> 00:17:05.950
I don't blame my blindness. I blame the individuals that may have, uh,

294
00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:09.970
really resulted in my mental health deteriorating.

295
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:14.680
And it wasn't actually until, uh, so I got like a surgery.

296
00:17:14.681 --> 00:17:18.520
It was experimental. I did regain vision, um, for the first time.

297
00:17:18.521 --> 00:17:21.490
And it was considered just visually impaired on the Mark.

298
00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:24.430
And that only lasted for about two years and then overnight,

299
00:17:24.431 --> 00:17:29.260
it all just deteriorated, went back to how it was. And, um,

300
00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:32.740
I didn't find happiness until after I went blind again. Um,

301
00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.830
I think it was just because this is how I'm supposed to experience life because

302
00:17:35.831 --> 00:17:38.470
I feel like there's a greater purpose for it, uh, in my life.

303
00:17:38.471 --> 00:17:39.760
And I got to do something with that.

304
00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:41.740
<v 2>James, I appreciate what you said.</v>

305
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:45.430
I thought that was quite powerful because I hadn't thought of it like that

306
00:17:45.431 --> 00:17:49.860
before being a person who has been in several situations where I was taken

307
00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:54.720
advantage of, um, whether it was by a family member, whether it was,

308
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:58.830
you know, a teacher molesting me as a teenager or even just more recently,

309
00:17:58.831 --> 00:18:01.620
whether it's kids being kids and kids trying to, you know,

310
00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:05.670
kind of get over on their blind parent. Um, of course I'm on it now,

311
00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:09.840
but all of those things, you know, kind of bleed into,

312
00:18:09.841 --> 00:18:14.040
into one principal theme that we are blind. Um,

313
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.050
and sometimes you're,

314
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:20.850
you're going to go to those emotional corners where I resent being blind because

315
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:24.720
of, you know, what people might do to, you know,

316
00:18:24.721 --> 00:18:29.220
weaponized my circumstance. Um, so, you know, James,

317
00:18:29.221 --> 00:18:31.050
you really said something that stuck with me there.

318
00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:35.590
<v 3>Mario. I appreciate how you phrased all that and shared all that.</v>

319
00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.200
<v 1>It's hard, isn't it? It's one of those things where you look back and you think,</v>

320
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:42.230
wow, why me? I guess that's what I did at the start.

321
00:18:42.231 --> 00:18:46.790
I was with my tub of Ben and Jerry's little bed.

322
00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:51.260
Yeah. Yeah. And I was that girl. I was the only girl in my family,

323
00:18:51.261 --> 00:18:54.440
in my friendship group. Everyone cited me,

324
00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:56.960
wishing she had a sight back and you know,

325
00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:00.950
my organ died in front of my eyes. It's like,

326
00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:04.850
of course I'm gonna feel low. You know? I mean, it is a.

327
00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.820
<v 3>The grieving process. It's definitely not just vision loss.</v>

328
00:19:07.821 --> 00:19:10.190
It's a loss of losing a sense of self as well.

329
00:19:10.191 --> 00:19:15.170
It's a loss of having hopes and desires for a future that might not be

330
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:17.060
what it is. It might be better.

331
00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:19.850
It won't be what you envisioned it to be originally. Right?

332
00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.810
<v 1>Blind people are three times more likely to deal with depression and anxiety.</v>

333
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:28.160
So if you are blind and you struggle with mental illness, um,

334
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:29.630
you don't have to feel alone.

335
00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.230
We statistically are more susceptible to struggling with it.

336
00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:34.820
And to me it makes sense. Ultimately,

337
00:19:34.821 --> 00:19:39.290
we're living in a world that isn't designed or created for us and we're making

338
00:19:39.291 --> 00:19:41.540
our way and we're doing it and we're killing it,

339
00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.650
but it does make life in certain, certain circumstances, more difficult.

340
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.830
I have experienced discrimination.

341
00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:53.990
<v 3>And would agree, strongly agree, strongly agree, strongly agree,</v>

342
00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.360
strongly agree, strongly agree.

343
00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:01.490
I was the only one that said somewhat [inaudible].

344
00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:06.350
<v 1>I wonder if the difference is, is given we all use mobility AIDS. Um.</v>

345
00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:11.540
<v 3>No, actually there's this intersectionality between living my entire life as a</v>

346
00:20:11.541 --> 00:20:13.580
black woman and being,

347
00:20:13.581 --> 00:20:17.030
as I've only been diagnosed with this disease and lived with it for the last 10

348
00:20:17.031 --> 00:20:17.301
years,

349
00:20:17.301 --> 00:20:22.130
I can see a clear difference between the discrimination of being black versus

350
00:20:22.131 --> 00:20:23.990
the discrimination of being blind.

351
00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:27.980
When I tell people that I've gone through something or faced discrimination as a

352
00:20:27.981 --> 00:20:29.240
black female,

353
00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:34.100
sometimes I'm met with doubt or kind of like pushing it to the

354
00:20:34.101 --> 00:20:37.430
side or it's in your head, or it's not that bad.

355
00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.970
Whereas I feel like people meet me halfway when it comes to my vision, loss,

356
00:20:40.971 --> 00:20:45.770
people find it admirable and kind of attached to it, identity as inspirational.

357
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:48.040
It's a different energy. It's a different temperature,

358
00:20:48.041 --> 00:20:50.860
which is why I said somewhat not strongly.

359
00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.770
<v 2>As a blind black man.</v>

360
00:20:52.771 --> 00:20:56.640
I can say that I've experienced discrimination on both fronts. Uh,

361
00:20:56.641 --> 00:21:00.420
unfortunately, you know, the crux of me is really the arts.

362
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.690
I did try out for American idol. There's several rounds of auditions.

363
00:21:03.691 --> 00:21:05.640
You have to go through to get on these reality shows.

364
00:21:05.641 --> 00:21:07.170
And this is like the first level of it.

365
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:11.640
They're at my guitar and I sing my heart out. And then the producer,

366
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.710
he stopped me and said, dude,

367
00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:19.260
normally we really don't let blind people through. And even if we do,

368
00:21:19.261 --> 00:21:21.330
we don't usually let them go so far goes there.

369
00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:25.470
They can be so difficult to deal with during production. The man you're so dope.

370
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.580
I got to say yes,

371
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:33.360
That type of stuff really can leave you feeling unaccomplished because obviously

372
00:21:33.361 --> 00:21:35.100
you want to be seen for your ability.

373
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.920
You want to be seen for the content of your character,

374
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:40.110
but unfortunately that doesn't always happen.

375
00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:44.640
And that can do a bigger plug to earlier conversation we had

376
00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:49.560
that can sometimes be a catalyst for a plunge into momentary

377
00:21:49.561 --> 00:21:50.580
depression as well.

378
00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:51.923
<v 1>I do feel like,</v>

379
00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.980
like the bulk of the discrimination that I face is due to my guide dog.

380
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:58.770
And it's only getting increasingly worse as the,

381
00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:03.120
the misuse of service dogs and the use of fake service dogs

382
00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:06.720
increases. I've been a guide dog user for 13 years now.

383
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:11.010
And over the last five year over year, it gets worse and worse and worse.

384
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:13.380
And I face more and more and more discrimination.

385
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:16.650
I strongly agree when I'm entering a say,

386
00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:21.540
people see my guide dog and not the person who needs a

387
00:22:21.541 --> 00:22:24.990
ride. I've had someone spits out me, um,

388
00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:28.650
and tell and swear at me. Um, and you know,

389
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:32.820
even though now I found great taxi drivers in central London,

390
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:35.580
um, it still does scare me.

391
00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.720
<v 4>Job related stuff. Uh, I've been in those interviews. Um,</v>

392
00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:43.530
everything seems to go well, they're giving me an estimation of like,

393
00:22:43.531 --> 00:22:47.400
when I'm going to hear back, Oh, it's gonna be next Tuesday. Yeah. We even want,

394
00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.530
you know, maybe even had this department.

395
00:22:49.531 --> 00:22:53.400
And then when you start mentioning accommodations in the conversation sort of

396
00:22:53.401 --> 00:22:57.000
shifts, and then next thing I know I get an automated, uh, you know, uh,

397
00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:00.000
decline like three email, 30 days later,

398
00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.890
instead of hearing back on that Tuesday.

399
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:06.750
<v 3>Oftentimes people come approach and, you know, want to ask to take a photo.</v>

400
00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:09.210
They'll always ask my husband, like,

401
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:12.840
is it okay if I take a photo with Christine? There's just things like that.

402
00:23:12.841 --> 00:23:14.640
That I think a lot of people don't think about.

403
00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:17.400
I feel like when someone asks somebody else,

404
00:23:17.401 --> 00:23:22.080
if they are allowed to take a photo with me that I'm a lesser person, um, that,

405
00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.600
you know, I cannot make my own independent decision.

406
00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:26.850
<v 2>I know it's a sighted world,</v>

407
00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:30.870
but I always find that amazing that because of the preconceived notion and what

408
00:23:30.871 --> 00:23:34.590
they think blind people should look like, or shouldn't look like that,

409
00:23:34.591 --> 00:23:37.890
I I'll be it. I think it's ridiculous that I even get things like, you know,

410
00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:41.190
there, there's no way this guy is blind. He's muscular. And it's like, what,

411
00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:42.323
what do you mean?

412
00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.030
<v 1>Yeah, blindness is quite rare.</v>

413
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:50.090
I think the main place that people get their opinion on what blindness must be

414
00:23:50.091 --> 00:23:54.530
like is through entertainment because I choose to put myself out there online

415
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.840
and I don't quote,

416
00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:01.310
look blind or look the way people think I'm supposed to. As a disabled woman,

417
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:05.000
I get a lot of she's faking it. You know, this whole Reddit threads,

418
00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:08.510
there's whole blogs devoted to trying to debunk my blindness.

419
00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.850
And that's why representation is so important.

420
00:24:10.851 --> 00:24:15.680
And that's why videos like this one is so important to watch to share,

421
00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:20.540
um, because we need the education to spread. So that, that ignorance is, um,

422
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.250
is combated with education.

423
00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:25.450
<v 0>If I could regain my sight with a cure,</v>

424
00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:30.040
I would want to strongly agree, somewhat agree,

425
00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:35.320
strongly disagree, disagree, strongly agree. Disagree.

426
00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:38.620
If I was to get my sight back,

427
00:24:38.621 --> 00:24:41.740
I would love to see the faces of the children that I've adopted.

428
00:24:41.741 --> 00:24:42.730
That would be amazing.

429
00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:44.050
<v 1>I said, disagree.</v>

430
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:49.060
I might answer probably a good four years ago would have been the complete

431
00:24:49.061 --> 00:24:51.430
opposite. I'm going to have my wedding next year.

432
00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:56.020
And there's so much of me that wants to see Ali's face when I'm walking down the

433
00:24:56.021 --> 00:25:00.940
aisle or my mom's face or my sister's face, or my dad's face again,

434
00:25:00.941 --> 00:25:05.710
because they have now faded from my memory that does hurt me

435
00:25:05.711 --> 00:25:10.540
inside quite deeply. And just thinking of the milestones really in life.

436
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:13.270
Um, having kids is only in the future,

437
00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:18.220
but I think the reason that my answer is disagree is because I have finally

438
00:25:18.221 --> 00:25:23.140
come to accept who I am and the fact that I really do deeply believe

439
00:25:23.141 --> 00:25:27.700
now that life without sight is truly beautiful.

440
00:25:27.701 --> 00:25:30.640
When I embraced that, that's when I don't want my sight back.

441
00:25:30.641 --> 00:25:34.180
I don't need it to feel fulfilled. And to feel that you say,

442
00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:38.710
I said disagree like Lucy, for many of the same reasons. Um,

443
00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:43.300
at the beginning of my vision loss, I dealt with a lot of anger,

444
00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:46.570
resentment. I threw myself pity parties asked why me,

445
00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:48.490
all I wanted was my sight back. In fact,

446
00:25:48.491 --> 00:25:52.660
I was literally the youth ambassador for a charity whose sole purpose was to

447
00:25:52.661 --> 00:25:54.460
fundraise, to find a cure for my disease.

448
00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.700
And along my self acceptance and self love journey,

449
00:25:57.701 --> 00:26:00.370
I realized how toxic that mindset was for me.

450
00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:03.100
And that's where the social model versus medical model comes in.

451
00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:07.810
The medical model is the idea that the answer to disability is curing

452
00:26:07.811 --> 00:26:12.490
it, um, which puts really the onus on the disabled person.

453
00:26:12.491 --> 00:26:15.750
We are the burden on society and we need to change be fixed,

454
00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:20.110
be healed in order to be whole or good enough or fit into society.

455
00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.920
Whereas the social model of disability says actually the disabled person is

456
00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.500
perfectly fine and they aren't the problem at all.

457
00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:31.600
The real problem is societies in accessibility with our infrastructure in terms

458
00:26:31.601 --> 00:26:35.470
of, you know, the design of our buildings and our physical space around us,

459
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:37.720
but also our technology, um,

460
00:26:37.721 --> 00:26:40.750
and just everything we use and interact with on a daily basis.

461
00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:44.400
So for all of those reasons, I don't want to cure. So have.

462
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:49.200
<v 4>Gone through a bit of a process of trying to cure my site,</v>

463
00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:51.000
uh, back when I was about 11 years old,

464
00:26:51.001 --> 00:26:53.730
feeling pressured to do so in order to fit in.

465
00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:55.620
And it reverting back within two years,

466
00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.590
I was never happy during those two years because I wasn't doing it for me.

467
00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:03.480
It really didn't feel like I was myself until I was able to really embrace my

468
00:27:03.481 --> 00:27:07.590
blindness. One in seven people in the world have some form of disability.

469
00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:11.280
And that may only increase as time goes on. I know for me,

470
00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:15.270
and the purpose that I'm here on this earth to do it's to leave this world a

471
00:27:15.271 --> 00:27:18.690
more accessible and accepting place than I found it.

472
00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:22.130
<v 3>I answered somewhat agree. Ideally,</v>

473
00:27:22.131 --> 00:27:26.720
I think I would want my vision back for like maybe a couple days just so I can

474
00:27:26.721 --> 00:27:29.270
watch some foreign films, see what, you know,

475
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:32.150
maybe my friends and family look like now,

476
00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:36.260
but then I feel like I don't necessarily want my

477
00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:41.900
full vision back forever because I think I'm kind of at the halfway point in my

478
00:27:41.901 --> 00:27:45.410
life where I've lived half of my life with vision and half of it without.

479
00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:49.460
So it would be so different in difficult.

480
00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:51.140
And I think losing my vision,

481
00:27:51.141 --> 00:27:55.910
put me in a position where I was forced to think

482
00:27:55.911 --> 00:28:00.590
outside of the box and create opportunities for myself and be more

483
00:28:00.591 --> 00:28:01.341
courageous,

484
00:28:01.341 --> 00:28:05.240
but it would be kind of cool just to see what cars look like nowadays,

485
00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:10.310
I've come more into myself and kind of like what Christine said.

486
00:28:10.311 --> 00:28:13.370
There's a lot about all of our characters that couldn't have been wouldn't have

487
00:28:13.371 --> 00:28:16.280
been, had it not been the challenges of losing her vision.

488
00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:19.520
I feel like I could take the last 10 years and the character development and

489
00:28:19.521 --> 00:28:22.460
take that forward, whether I'm visually impaired.

490
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:26.750
<v 2>Yeah. I don't think I would be the person I am today.</v>

491
00:28:26.751 --> 00:28:29.600
If I hadn't lost my vision. But past that, you know,

492
00:28:29.601 --> 00:28:32.930
I really work hard to be the coolest flying dad ever.

493
00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:35.270
My kids don't miss the beat.

494
00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:39.530
I'm able to chase in play with my seven and 10 year old. Um,

495
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:43.940
I boxed with my team, my, my teenagers, they think I'm Superman. Cause they,

496
00:28:43.941 --> 00:28:47.570
they see me work out all the time and we play and we do this and we do that.

497
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:52.460
I'm content just being I'm super blind, Mario.

498
00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:56.450
<v 3>Any of you. But sometimes when I think about who I would be, if I was cited,</v>

499
00:28:56.451 --> 00:28:59.540
like it's scares me. I'm like, I don't know who that person would be.

500
00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.140
And I'm so happy with this person then I'm like, I don't want to see you.

501
00:29:03.141 --> 00:29:07.780
She would be this person's good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I need to think about that.

502
00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:12.350
<v 4>I wholeheartedly respect everyone's journey and everyone's perspective. Yeah.</v>

503
00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:15.350
<v 3>Yeah. Definitely. Blindness is a spectrum home rules.</v>

504
00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:19.790
<v 2>No, this was great. You guys, this is an amazing bunch.</v>

505
00:29:19.791 --> 00:29:22.520
I'm so honored to meet everybody and, and just.

506
00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:27.800
<v 3>Yeah. Beautiful experience. I loved hearing you guys.</v>

507
00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:33.530
All of you. It's so nice meeting all of you. I hope we can all stay in touch.

508
00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.420
Yeah, it sounds good. It was nice talking to everybody.

509
00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:40.550
I'm going to go to bed now guys. Take care. Everyone, stay safe.
