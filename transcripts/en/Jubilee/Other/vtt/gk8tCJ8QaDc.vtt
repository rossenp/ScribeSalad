00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.680
<v 0>Whenever a question comes to mind.</v>

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.690
Search is one of the first places we turn to Google search has fundamentally

3
00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:11.280
changed the way we access information, but how much do we really know about it?

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.300
We partnered with Google and invited someone from the search team to speak with

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.810
her viewers so that we could ask them anything.

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.330
Thanks to Google for sponsoring this episode.

7
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.280
<v 1>My name is Danny Sullivan. I am Google's public liaison for search.</v>

8
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.090
I worked within our search team to help foster two-way communications with

9
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.920
people who are outside of Google and bring some of the questions and interests

10
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.650
and issues that they may raise back into our search team.

11
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.390
And I'm super excited to answer a lot of the questions people have today. Hi,

12
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.530
I'm Ben. Nice to meet you. Thanks for coming with some questions today.

13
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.360
<v 2>First question is,</v>

14
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.100
is there someone on the other side judging my search history?

15
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.293
No.

16
00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.050
<v 1>Yes. When I first came to Google, I was asking about something and I said,</v>

17
00:01:00.051 --> 00:01:03.620
well here, I just did this. Can you do that again? So I can't. And he's like,

18
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.690
I literally can't look at that because it's your private information.

19
00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:12.550
I don't have the ability to access that. There's no group of people going.

20
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.990
<v 2>That's a big relief.</v>

21
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.370
<v 1>Good, good, good. So, so feel free to, to search your way.</v>

22
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.370
How do you decide what's most important?

23
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.790
It helps if I talk maybe a little bit about the parts of a, of a search engine.

24
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.120
So we go out and we visit pages across the internet.

25
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.170
You store them like sort of a big book of the internet and kind of crawl through

26
00:01:33.171 --> 00:01:36.710
that book and pick out the pages of relevant and different things we use to,

27
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.510
to rank out some of those pages.

28
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.080
If you were to take the index and all the pages that we have found,

29
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.400
I think our statistic is it might go to the moon 12 times and back, Oh wow.

30
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.600
Those are cat videos. And we make use of what we call signals.

31
00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:54.140
Like what other words in the document, how do people link to this page?

32
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.610
Are those good quality links?

33
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.760
Is this page super loaded down with a bunch of ads and popups.

34
00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:01.310
This is page load really quickly on a mobile device.

35
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.290
We put that all together and then that's how we,

36
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.510
we decide what seems to be the most relevant thing to show.

37
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.920
<v 2>It's really like, cool. It's so fast. Yeah.</v>

38
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.760
What happens to my search? Is it something that's saved?

39
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.320
Does it go to an ether?

40
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.290
<v 1>If you're searching with a Google account,</v>

41
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.660
then it'll be stored into your search history.

42
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.710
You have the option to go through and say, I want to delete out all.

43
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.920
If you really, really want to, you can just use Google incognito.

44
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.400
One of the things I think it was really excited about like six months or so ago,

45
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.121
we rolled it out.

46
00:02:32.121 --> 00:02:35.720
So you could automatically delete your search history so that you would say

47
00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:38.630
after three months, or I think the other one is after 18 months,

48
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.330
just automatically delete all this stuff. We don't want to keep it going.

49
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.610
And then I think the other part that's important as well.

50
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.960
Why have that information? And the reason we use it for Google searches,

51
00:02:47.961 --> 00:02:51.050
because it will let us make better search results for you. Yeah.

52
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.400
If you walked into a library and you went backpack, right.

53
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.300
Like, okay. Um, you know, and they would have a conversation with you.

54
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:02.950
We don't kind of have that opportunity,

55
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:06.130
but we do have the opportunity when you do a series of searches.

56
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:07.120
So it's sort of out of.

57
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.260
<v 2>So they kind of like connect the dots for the searches that you make.</v>

58
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.310
And then my second question is, do they track your conversations?

59
00:03:14.311 --> 00:03:15.210
Like when you say stuff,

60
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.630
when I'm talking and like my phone's off and I see ads of something,

61
00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:21.240
exactly thing, like, is that true or no?

62
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.740
<v 1>And it happened to me before as well. And you're like, Oh, how did that happen?</v>

63
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.460
And it's like, no, I'll speak for Google. It's really not.

64
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.480
You got to push something or do something to send us what you're talking about.

65
00:03:33.481 --> 00:03:37.590
Like, you use the wake word, then the wake word will transmit that back to us.

66
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.380
And it's just not going out there and just, you know,

67
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.200
constantly transmitting a stream of information back.

68
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.150
Wouldn't be that useful anyway. Right.

69
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.600
<v 2>Pandemic change. They use her behavior. Yeah.</v>

70
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.670
<v 1>Yes. Um, wow. Did it ever,</v>

71
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.350
we'd never seen so many searches for a single topic or a

72
00:03:55.351 --> 00:03:59.160
sustained period of time. So at first it's like, what are the symptoms of it?

73
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.980
And then it's like what our treatments and what our testing centers.

74
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.400
And then it's, what's open. How do I make a stay at home gym?

75
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.580
How do I make sourdough bread? It's changed. Um,

76
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.700
know the way we've had to react to try to make sure we're getting all the best

77
00:04:11.701 --> 00:04:13.350
information out there, response for people.

78
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.120
<v 2>It's like, we're all,</v>

79
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.680
there's like a kind of union in a kind of set away. Right?

80
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.540
We're all together.

81
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.660
<v 1>It's definitely been so much sadness that there's also been,</v>

82
00:04:24.661 --> 00:04:26.790
I think a lot of hopefulness and in the way,

83
00:04:26.791 --> 00:04:29.880
a lot of people have unified and carried on and found ways to keep going.

84
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.900
<v 2>I feel like the country is in such a polarizing time now.</v>

85
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.820
So I guess one example I'm thinking of is getting the flu shot.

86
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.500
There are people who say it can help prevent COVID-19 and there are people who

87
00:04:43.501 --> 00:04:45.300
say it gives you a greater chance of it.

88
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.520
If someone had previously looked things up related to, for example,

89
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.780
the anti-vaccination side of it,

90
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.220
would it be more difficult for them to find something that could possibly change

91
00:04:56.221 --> 00:04:56.910
their mind?

92
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.590
<v 1>No, it shouldn't be more difficult at all.</v>

93
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.270
So what you're referring to sometimes gets termed as a filter bubble.

94
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.930
So it's like, you've looked at all this information.

95
00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:10.060
And so now you're going to get more information that aligns with say your,

96
00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:11.760
your preconceived view.

97
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.210
A lot of people think that the search results for every individual are super

98
00:05:15.211 --> 00:05:17.820
personalized. They're not, they're really not.

99
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.970
You're really going to get the same information. It's not going to change.

100
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.210
I think one of the reasons why people sometimes get confused is because

101
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.460
sometimes two different people can see very different results for the same

102
00:05:29.461 --> 00:05:32.250
search. That's not personalization where it happens.

103
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.390
That's almost always localization. You said you were in Canada, is that right?

104
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.050
Yep, exactly. Yeah. If we both searched for pizza places,

105
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.640
we're going to get different results.

106
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.070
You don't want to know the best pizza places in a city.

107
00:05:44.071 --> 00:05:48.150
That's a hundred miles away from you. So people can sometimes see that and go,

108
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.970
Oh, my road salts are much different because they,

109
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.540
they personalize them and he's like, no, no. Um, that's why it's.

110
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.130
<v 2>My second question is a big, um, can.</v>

111
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.810
<v 3>The algorithm determine the difference between fact and fiction and</v>

112
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.300
if not, does that worry you a little bit?

113
00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.850
<v 1>Um, so no account human beings can't even figure that out.</v>

114
00:06:09.851 --> 00:06:14.710
Sometimes she's like really complicated, but to the broader point,

115
00:06:14.711 --> 00:06:18.340
it's really that people want to be able to search for things and know that

116
00:06:18.341 --> 00:06:22.900
they're getting good, reliable information. And we think so. We hope so. And we,

117
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.620
we certainly do our best to show the most reliable information we can.

118
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.590
<v 3>Yeah. After all you guys are a search engine, you're not like the fact checkers.</v>

119
00:06:29.591 --> 00:06:30.550
Right. So it makes sense.

120
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.150
<v 1>Yes. But we do do a lot of work to try to make sure we are surfacing good,</v>

121
00:06:34.151 --> 00:06:34.984
like fact checking.

122
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.140
Sometimes if you search for something and we surface a fact check,

123
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.820
we can even have it tell you like true or false, according to that fact checker.

124
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.600
<v 4>So one thing I want to know is can the algorithm be racist?</v>

125
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.930
<v 1>So the algorithm is not designed to be racist. The web,</v>

126
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.240
just like society as a whole can have racist or problematic content that's

127
00:06:55.241 --> 00:06:58.450
on it. That doesn't mean that we just say, well,

128
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.140
that is what's out there. And that's why it happens.

129
00:07:02.141 --> 00:07:03.670
And that's our excuse.

130
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.820
That's really more to explain why it can sometimes happen.

131
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:11.470
There's always the chance that you could possibly do some kind of a search that

132
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:12.880
might bring forward. What,

133
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.410
what sometimes called a data void this referred to the idea that there's not

134
00:07:17.411 --> 00:07:20.350
really good content. That's written about a particular topic.

135
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.220
<v 4>Yeah. I mean, are there any concrete examples where, you know,</v>

136
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:28.660
racism in the world was influencing what was naturally maybe getting aggregated

137
00:07:28.661 --> 00:07:30.520
and you guys had a course corrected.

138
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.120
<v 1>There's one good example. It's been very public that we talked about,</v>

139
00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:38.770
which was a few years ago. Uh, if you searched for that, the Holocaust happened.

140
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.310
We would tend to list a lot of Holocaust denial sites.

141
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:47.290
It was quite simply because it's such a known fact that

142
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.840
authorities were not writing content saying yes, the Holocaust happened.

143
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.620
One of the things that we learned from that was that we needed to do a better

144
00:07:56.621 --> 00:07:59.830
job of understanding in cases where we don't have good,

145
00:07:59.831 --> 00:08:04.630
reliable information that maybe we need to go beyond just the

146
00:08:04.631 --> 00:08:08.230
exact order of the words and the exact phrasing of the words and go more into

147
00:08:08.231 --> 00:08:09.550
the concept. So that,

148
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:14.470
that of surfacing content that is that the Holocaust happened. No,

149
00:08:14.471 --> 00:08:17.980
it didn't happen as denial content. You're surfacing more content about,

150
00:08:17.981 --> 00:08:19.390
say the Holocaust in general.

151
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:24.100
And then that helps people better understand the whole concept. Overall.

152
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.800
<v 5>I'm finding that I'm spending a lot of time on Google these days,</v>

153
00:08:26.801 --> 00:08:28.690
especially leading up to the election,

154
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:32.170
just trying to understand the issues and candidates and all of that.

155
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:36.280
Do you think that the search engine algorithm can contribute to political

156
00:08:36.281 --> 00:08:39.070
polarization? That's kind of occurring sometimes in the States.

157
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.660
<v 1>We hope that they don't,</v>

158
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:45.550
our systems don't understand that any kind of content has any political leaning

159
00:08:45.551 --> 00:08:47.620
or political qualifications. Like we don't know,

160
00:08:47.621 --> 00:08:51.190
like that's a left leaning page or a right-leaning page.

161
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.370
Our sisters also don't understand when someone's searching,

162
00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.190
if they have kind of political leads.

163
00:08:56.191 --> 00:09:00.360
So we don't have any of the ingredients to polarize. If we wanted to,

164
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:01.290
in the first place,

165
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.160
we really believed that there should be a commonality in the search results.

166
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:09.180
And that really our goal is to try to show everybody the best information and

167
00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:11.040
most reliable information we can.

168
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.050
And hopefully if people take from that and they make their own decisions and

169
00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:20.280
they'd look at a variety of information from a variety of resources and come to

170
00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:21.390
their own conclusions from that,

171
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:25.650
I always wanted to know how does the auto-complete feature on Google work?

172
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:30.150
Because so many times it's freakishly close to what I'm actually thinking at the

173
00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:34.740
basic level we're going through and trying to predict what's likely that

174
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:39.390
you're going to type next based on all the searches that we've seen before.

175
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:43.860
It saves, we figure about 25% of the time that you would normally spend typing.

176
00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.460
And I think we even calculated one stat that like all the time savings is like

177
00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:50.700
200 years of typing saved up each day.

178
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.350
Also mentioned by the way that we won't always just show the,

179
00:09:53.351 --> 00:09:55.320
the most common searches that happen.

180
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:59.790
But we won't show things that we think might be harmful or perhaps derogatory,

181
00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:03.270
or that might be advancing stereotypes with soda feels a good thing that I

182
00:10:03.271 --> 00:10:05.880
guess, um, there's a lot of people in the world that think like me.

183
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.060
So that sort of makes the world a bit smaller.

184
00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:11.550
It totally resonated to me when you say I don't feel low because it was exactly

185
00:10:11.551 --> 00:10:14.550
how I felt. I think I remarked to my wife and the cashier, like, Oh,

186
00:10:14.551 --> 00:10:19.110
we're not the only ones about that character or who are.

187
00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:24.290
<v 2>Do you think having access to so much information increases anxiety,</v>

188
00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.630
especially in young adults or young people?

189
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:28.010
<v 1>Um, I hope not.</v>

190
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.700
I don't think it should make you anxious that you have access to lots of

191
00:10:31.701 --> 00:10:33.920
information. I think if you're better informed,

192
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.140
you should make you less anxious. You know,

193
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.550
hopefully sometimes it's pretty straightforward information. Like, you know,

194
00:10:40.551 --> 00:10:43.070
I want to buy a suitcase sometimes it's like,

195
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:46.130
I need to get to an earthquake shelter or a hurricane shelter,

196
00:10:46.131 --> 00:10:49.610
or I need to understand if I have a symptom or something.

197
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:54.590
<v 6>I love that. Especially like now you're not limited to learning just in school.</v>

198
00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.190
Google really does help educate people and like get them resources that they

199
00:10:58.191 --> 00:11:00.140
wouldn't be able to get as immediately.

200
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.880
<v 1>One thing I would say is that it's not, I think so much that we're educating,</v>

201
00:11:04.881 --> 00:11:08.060
but the latter part of what you said, get you to the resources and information.

202
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:12.290
And ultimately it's really that people educate themselves or they have great

203
00:11:12.291 --> 00:11:15.350
teachers or they have great people who support them and brought them up.

204
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.040
So it's nice that we're complimentary, we're part of that overall process.

205
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:20.980
<v 2>Yeah. Critical thinking is,</v>

206
00:11:20.981 --> 00:11:25.790
is like essential to live in a society like this because we will never know.

207
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.790
<v 1>Yeah. Well, it was very, very nice to meet you. Thank you so much.</v>

208
00:11:28.791 --> 00:11:32.810
Nice meeting you, Danny. This has been a, uh, it's been a highlight of my month,

209
00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.110
you know, who talks to anybody anymore, right? I mean,

210
00:11:36.111 --> 00:11:39.440
you're talking about like, it's all new people.

211
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:43.010
I will say hi to you in my next Google search.

212
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.990
I won't see it because of privacy.

213
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:50.061
They good humans.

214
00:11:50.061 --> 00:11:53.030
Thank you so much for watching this video and thanks to Google for,

215

<v 7>This episode.</v>

217
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:59.950
I literally use Google for everything from fact checking statements to

218
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.770
seeing that chinchillas could eat paper. No thank you, Danny,

219
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.160
