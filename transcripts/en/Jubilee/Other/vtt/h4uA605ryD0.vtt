1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.620
<v 0>It is my lady. Oh, it is my love. Oh, that she knew that she were,</v>

2
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.260
we brought together seven actors.

3
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.670
<v 1>I am an actor. I'm an actor. I am an actor. I am an actor. I'm an actor.</v>

4
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.850
I am an actor. I'm a great actor. I'm a confident actor.

5
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.440
<v 0>There is a liar. If the group discovers who the liar is,</v>

6
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.570
they'll win a cash prize. If the liar survives,

7
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.170
they win the entire prize. This is Bob out.

8
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.380
When did you first realize that you wanted to be an actor? Second grade?

9
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.850
I was five when I was in college and I said, he brought in Paris.

10
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.470
<v 1>That's pretty late. You know.</v>

11
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.570
<v 0>I'm being honest. You guys are lying. So.</v>

12
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.060
<v 1>Nobody decides late in life. They want to be an actor.</v>

13
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.350
Otherwise she had to be crazy.

14
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.100
<v 0>Quick intros on just like what we're doing now. Yeah, that'd be really cool.</v>

15
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.950
<v 1>Uh, I currently have a web. Is that right now? Angel city heroes.</v>

16
00:01:00.951 --> 00:01:04.040
So check it out. Where can we find that online fit TV network or Google.

17
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.130
<v 0>At T V network. We're coming down to 20 seconds. Okay.</v>

18
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.930
I also have a web series out called Catlin's Lake.

19
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.590
Do you guys have a TV show out one strange. Happy. Just took it off of Amazon.

20
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.790
Cause we got a distribution deal.

21
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.360
<v 1>I just finished a guest spot on nine one, one on Fox. Thank you.</v>

22
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.220
I played a creepy guy. Exciting. That was my ride.

23
00:01:21.221 --> 00:01:23.120
I just did a Colgate commercial.

24
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.290
<v 0>Corporate stuff. I'm doing a lot of corporate stuff. I don't want to say like,</v>

25
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.790
it seemed like he was trying to push the target.

26
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.860
Someone else try to make us less suspicious of him. It looks like an actor.

27
00:01:42.861 --> 00:01:43.850
She sounds like an actor,

28
00:01:43.851 --> 00:01:47.930
but it just seemed like she isn't necessarily pursuing acting.

29
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.640
<v 1>When we all said, when we've decided to become actors,</v>

30
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.830
she was the only one that made that decision late in life.

31
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.183
<v 0>Okay.</v>

32
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.890
<v 1>Quickest role of my career. I was a creepy guy on the show.</v>

33
00:02:06.891 --> 00:02:10.880
Nine 11 on Fox. Maybe they thought I wasn't creepy, which would be flattering.

34
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.420
You know, I'd like to think that, that they all saw me and they said this guy,

35
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.600
he's not creepy. He's he's a nice guy. What was your face.

36
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.370
<v 0>Today that you've gone? Oh man.</v>

37
00:02:19.371 --> 00:02:22.730
I was just on an episode of the Wonderland murders and a plate,

38
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.870
the murderer for the episode that I was going to be horror movie,

39
00:02:26.871 --> 00:02:29.840
which was a lot of fun. Did you get killed? I did get killed.

40
00:02:29.841 --> 00:02:31.760
I was hacking for a second. Oh, sorry. Spoilers.

41
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.380
<v 1>Uh, is the one I'm currently doing?</v>

42
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.330
Cause I get to play like a crazy action heroes.

43
00:02:35.331 --> 00:02:38.270
A lot of like fighting and somewhere. Um,

44
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.560
mine was a M stoner rom com. It was on Hulu.

45
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.450
<v 0>Interesting. Yeah, he's really quiet. Um,</v>

46
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.020
and he didn't really participate in the conversation and he was very,

47
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:54.710
very vague. Um, I was on a recent episode of shame.

48
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.950
I acted opposite of William H Macy was, was really, really cool. Yeah.

49
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.070
Like the legend is friends, right? He was.

50
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.720
<v 1>He was an easy, Oh, I thought it was friends. I don't know.</v>

51
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.130
Interesting question though. He just had an interesting energy.

52
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.780
It didn't seem like it was connected to being in the industry being established.

53
00:03:13.781 --> 00:03:16.390
Did you guys, uh, train anyone? Go to school for acting?

54
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.970
I went to performing arts high school. Okay, cool.

55
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.070
I took a couple classes over at, uh, SM CC Santa Monica college. Yeah.

56
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.790
Okay, cool. Has that, is that where it ends or you have a future?

57
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.710
I think I learned what I needed to learn. So now I'm just auditioning, you know,

58
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.150
all you guys, you know? Oh, we're out of time.

59
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.363
<v 0>Oh,</v>

60
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.550
something didn't really feel right.

61
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.190
But he just didn't seem as like,

62
00:03:50.191 --> 00:03:54.360
as part of the group kind of made me wonder if he knew what we were talking

63
00:03:54.361 --> 00:03:55.194
about.

64
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.550
I'm a working actor. I'm a great actor. I'm a confident actor.

65
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.720
So much love to everybody, right?

66
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.340
Yeah. Nothing against anyone. Are you guys familiar with Romeo and Juliet? Yeah,

67
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.260
totally. Yeah. But soft. What light through yonder window breaks.

68
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.950
It is the East end. Juliet is the sun arise,

69
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.560
fair sun and kill. The envy is smooth.

70
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.570
Who is already sick and pale with grief that thou art the,

71
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.513
Oh, of course.

72
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.080
<v 1>There's a great way to tell if you're an actor because you can emote at the</v>

73
00:04:43.081 --> 00:04:44.760
right time while you're reading.

74
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.070
It's fair to say that you know what you're doing?

75
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.130
<v 0>None but falls to where it cast it off.</v>

76
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.500
It is my lady. Oh, it is my love. Oh,

77
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:56.910
but she knew that she works

78
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.760
over Romeo Romeo where art thou Romeo.

79
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.590
So there's been a tie between two people, Molly and Reese. Wow.

80
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.090
So we're going to do a rebuilt.

81
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.830
<v 1>I vote between those two. Oh, okay. Sorry. Can I redo mine?</v>

82
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.210
<v 0>Sorry. I'm sorry. Super loud.</v>

83
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.070
We can end the game now. Or do you feel like the mall is still in the box?

84
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.190
We should get it. I think we have. We should continue. We should continue.

85
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.810
<v 1>I think so. We're going to be shocked at the end. We're going to be surprised.</v>

86
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.430
We were really vibing. We had a great energy and that is what threw me off.

87
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.860
That's what kind of put up the red flag in my head.

88
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.930
<v 0>If the lights turn green, voted out</v>

89
00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.990
red box, you can call people. Yeah. Okay.

90
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.903
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

91
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.460
<v 0>Will please step forward now.</v>

92
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.650
<v 1>Right away. I got a man. I thought it was you. I thought it was him.</v>

93
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.040
Yes. I'm not playing. I apparently played the game wrong.

94
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.910
I picked you both times. I thought that was the point

95
00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.360
I made everybody believe me. I think I should have won.

96
00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.210
Took the whole 400 because I fooled everybody.

97
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.810
I basically out acted everyone. And I guarantee you,

98
00:07:07.811 --> 00:07:12.310
if we asked who the mole was, everybody would have picked me at first.

99
00:07:12.311 --> 00:07:15.490
I was a little embarrassed because I was like, it's that obvious.

100
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.490
And then I kind of watched them pick one each other apart. And I was like, Oh,

101
00:07:18.491 --> 00:07:21.760
this is fantastic. Like entertainment wise. I'm so happy. I went out right away.

102
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:22.720
They would have figured it out.

103
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.360
Like I can act if I had to do the Romeo and Juliet thing,

104
00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:26.740
they would've known right then and there,

105
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:31.390
I felt very unprepared about Romeo and Juliet. It's a whole nother skill.

106
00:07:31.391 --> 00:07:33.940
Almost like you have film, you have theater and then you have Shakespeare.

107
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.500
I'm really, really proud of everyone else. Apparently not me because, uh,

108
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.110
I, I didn't know who the mole was.

109
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.340
First game show up in on first time I won. So I'm one for one. So, you know,

110
00:07:45.341 --> 00:07:49.570
that's pretty cool. So yes,

111
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.540
I'm the winner and I hate to say it,

112
00:07:52.541 --> 00:07:55.750
but I out acted and outsmarted everybody up on the stage.

113
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.240
I'm going to be thanked for coffee and ones for like three months.
