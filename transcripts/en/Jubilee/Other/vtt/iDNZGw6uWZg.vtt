00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.730
<v 0>What does it feel like when a man penetrates you?</v>

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.720
Can you explain it in a way where men can understand, Oh wait,

3
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.360
did your first time hurt?

4
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.130
<v 1>I do remember it being a pleasant experience,</v>

5
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.870
but it was painful and I was sore for like days after.

6
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.350
No, it didn't hurt at all. Actually it was really careful about it.

7
00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:42.350
And he made sure to ask me if it did hurt or not. Yeah.

8
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.140
<v 0>I wasn't used to have any, having anything in my vagina.</v>

9
00:00:45.141 --> 00:00:46.790
Like I didn't even use tampons at the time.

10
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.560
<v 1>I don't know bleeding, anything like that. It was like very great. We did it.</v>

11
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.620
It was done. We got burritos after it was very enjoyable.

12
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.540
I wish there was some sort of education on like more of the

13
00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:02.840
emotional side, because after like my first,

14
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.160
it took me so long to even like kiss anyone again,

15
00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:11.270
just because it felt very odd to me because this was like something that had

16
00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:15.650
been reserved for one person for a very long time. And like,

17
00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:18.980
I was trying to navigate like dating and relationships.

18
00:01:18.981 --> 00:01:23.690
And I felt like I couldn't have a normal relationship because any man coming on

19
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.490
to me, even if that's what the setting was,

20
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.030
even if it's something that I would've wanted to do, it just felt wrong to me.

21
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.330
<v 0>What does it feel like when a man penetrates you?</v>

22
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.320
Can you explain it in a way where men can understand? Oh wait.

23
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.330
Oh, that's so weird.

24
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.790
<v 1>And I try my best for a man.</v>

25
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.890
When you really have the urge to go to the bathroom,

26
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.080
that feeling that like relief, except for it's the reverse.

27
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.040
You don't like, feel it in one spot. It kind of like,

28
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.490
you feel it, you know, when you have to, like, you put like a,

29
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.670
like a lid on something it's like oddly satisfying.

30
00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:09.140
When you put a lid on a jar of pickles and S did I really just describe it as

31
00:02:09.141 --> 00:02:13.610
that? Do you ever worry your vagina doesn't look normal?

32
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.290
Yes.

33
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.140
<v 0>I felt like I didn't have any formal.</v>

34
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.320
<v 1>Not anymore. I definitely did at one point,</v>

35
00:02:21.321 --> 00:02:24.890
because then I would hear like this whole rhetoric about like roast beef or

36
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:27.740
whatever. And I was like, my vagina kind of does look like roast beef.

37
00:02:27.741 --> 00:02:31.070
And I don't know why that's a problem. If you're on birth control,

38
00:02:31.071 --> 00:02:34.520
how does it affect your body? So it's not something I'm currently on,

39
00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:38.630
but when I was on it, it, I believed that it was clear my acne,

40
00:02:38.631 --> 00:02:40.430
because that's something I heard for a long time,

41
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.420
but it did the complete opposite. It made it worse. I for sure had mood swings.

42
00:02:44.421 --> 00:02:46.670
And I feel like that's not who I am at all.

43
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.500
It might take you several different tries with birth control to find one that

44
00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:56.090
works for your body. For me, I loved the NuvaRing. My sister tried the NuvaRing.

45
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.460
She gained like 15 pounds and hated it.

46
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.590
The main thing is to make sure you're always taking it because I have a tendency

47
00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:07.000
to forget. And that's when it really messes you up with the implant. Um,

48
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.740
I bled for almost a year straight, so that wasn't fun at all.

49
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.570
If you have any questions, just talk to a doctor about sex on your period.

50
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:20.560
How in all caps? Um,

51
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.560
never have I ever, well,

52
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.590
I did have my period for a year straight,

53
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.780
so that's something I had to figure out.

54
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.920
You gotta use a towel and a condom. Honestly,

55
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:37.870
it feels better because your hormones are so all over the place that it's kinda

56
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.590
it's, it's not as, it's not as bad as everyone thinks it is.

57
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:42.721
<v 2>Personally to me,</v>

58
00:03:42.721 --> 00:03:46.680
sex on my period just seems uncomfortable because I'm already cramping up a lot.

59
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.320
You're already really sensitive by your vagina.

60
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.030
<v 1>Things like diva cups and different types of period products,</v>

61
00:03:54.031 --> 00:03:58.530
per se, that can go inside of you and you can have mess free.

62
00:03:58.531 --> 00:04:02.100
That's how they advertise it. Mass free period sex.

63
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.960
<v 2>Is it normally? I know some people who would say no, it's not.</v>

64
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.080
And I disagree wholeheartedly. I feel like people were like,

65
00:04:10.081 --> 00:04:13.740
I don't mess around. I don't want you. I don't do anything that builds up.

66
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.340
And I feel like masturbation is a way to kind of let it out.

67
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.540
<v 1>I do it probably every day. Have you ever questioned your sexuality?</v>

68
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.170
Yes. I went through like a whole questioning phase.

69
00:04:25.171 --> 00:04:29.760
Like would I ever really be attracted to another woman?

70
00:04:29.761 --> 00:04:32.400
I think that's very normal for people to go through.

71
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.760
Even just like coming to terms with the fact that you're straight.

72
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.760
I had one very strong crush on a girl,

73
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.960
but I think it was more of an infatuation with just the way she looked.

74
00:04:42.961 --> 00:04:45.330
I wanted to look like her more so than being with her.

75
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.500
<v 2>Have you ever had an orgasm? I have not. Yes.</v>

76
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.540
<v 1>Yes. Nope.</v>

77
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.960
<v 2>Growing up, especially during puberty,</v>

78
00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.240
there was sort of like this feeling ashamed tag around girls, um,

79
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.270
going through puberty and feeling horny. Like if I felt a little horny,

80
00:05:03.271 --> 00:05:06.210
I was like, Oh no, like this isn't normal. If I'm horny,

81
00:05:06.211 --> 00:05:08.220
I just sit through it and I don't do anything about it.

82
00:05:08.221 --> 00:05:11.610
And I wait until it passes. But because of that, like later my body,

83
00:05:11.611 --> 00:05:15.360
like just when it's like about to organism my body like shuts down. It's like,

84
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.980
no, you're not going to that's. And that's just my mind blocking it,

85
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.810
which is something I'm working on.

86
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.810
Have you ever faked an orgasm? Hmm,

87
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.570
one time in my early days. Cause I felt so bad,

88
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.080
but never again. I felt like a shame that I was taking too long.

89
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.430
You kind of have this expectation that you're going to act like the girls in the

90
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.420
pornos.

91
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.520
Is it important to find a partner that can make you orgasm if they can't make

92
00:05:50.521 --> 00:05:52.110
you orgasm? At first,

93
00:05:52.111 --> 00:05:56.640
I think you should find a partner who's willing to learn and adjust to what you

94
00:05:56.641 --> 00:05:58.700
want. So you both can have a better time.

95
00:05:58.701 --> 00:06:00.650
And I think if they learn to adjust to what you like,

96
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:02.570
then their partner worth having around them nets.

97
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.850
That's the partner you want to have sex with.

98
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.670
<v 1>For so long, I was with partners.</v>

99
00:06:06.671 --> 00:06:09.190
I mean for five or six years when I was first having sex,

100
00:06:09.191 --> 00:06:12.730
I was with partners again and again, that never made me orgasm,

101
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.100
but I also didn't know how to make myself work as them.

102
00:06:15.101 --> 00:06:18.940
So I wasn't masturbating. I wasn't communicating with my partners.

103
00:06:18.941 --> 00:06:21.220
I didn't know what positions were turn-ons for me.

104
00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.580
I had to have a conversation with him cause I'm like, I'm lying.

105
00:06:24.581 --> 00:06:25.900
I'm lying to me. I'm lying to him.

106
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.460
The whole experience just could be so much better.

107
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.860
And so I remember he was laying in bed and we had the conversation and

108
00:06:32.861 --> 00:06:35.380
he was saying, he's like, Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

109
00:06:35.381 --> 00:06:39.370
So it's not necessarily important for me to be with a partner that makes me

110
00:06:39.371 --> 00:06:40.090
orgasm.

111
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.530
But it is important for me to be with a partner that prioritizes my pleasure.

112
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.850
Do you feel like you mostly just accommodate men and what they want during sex?

113
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.800
I definitely get like nervous in the sense of like, am I performing well,

114
00:06:53.801 --> 00:06:57.070
am I doing a good job at first? Yes.

115
00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.630
As I started to be with more people,

116
00:07:01.631 --> 00:07:04.420
I started to realize they start to ask, well, what do you want me to do?

117
00:07:04.421 --> 00:07:08.230
What do you like? And I was like, what, what do I like?

118
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.090
That's I don't know. What do you consider assault or rape?

119
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.130
I think I may have been, but I don't exactly.

120
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.053
<v 0>I know.</v>

121
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:28.090
<v 1>I know a lot of people are taught rape or assault. Is this big, scary,</v>

122
00:07:28.091 --> 00:07:29.140
aggressive thing.

123
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:34.270
It could be something like with someone you're really comfortable with or

124
00:07:34.271 --> 00:07:37.210
someone you considered yourself to trust.

125
00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.670
Is it okay if I talk about an assault?

126
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.210
Cause like my first time was like a coercion kind of situation.

127
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.230
I knew at some point I wanted to do it with that person,

128
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.650
but I just didn't feel like I was ready per se.

129
00:07:50.651 --> 00:07:53.800
And I was pressured into it, which was something that like,

130
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.450
we're not really taught,

131
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:59.800
taught about like coercion and stuff like that in school and really the depth of

132
00:07:59.801 --> 00:08:03.640
consent. So I didn't really have the understanding. Like I just,

133
00:08:03.641 --> 00:08:08.110
because I did say yes eventually and it did end up going that way that

134
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.150
that's not okay. So many of us have this question.

135
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:18.550
I've had very personal conversations with dear friends who didn't come to

136
00:08:18.551 --> 00:08:22.630
terms with the fact that they had been assaulted or raped until five or six

137
00:08:22.631 --> 00:08:26.950
years later, if you can afford, or if your insurance covers it,

138
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.860
get some professional advice and guidance on this,

139
00:08:29.861 --> 00:08:34.780
because this is a question that really needs to

140
00:08:34.781 --> 00:08:36.010
be talked about more.

141
00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:41.170
<v 2>And then last question. What is something that you wish you were in fact that,</v>

142
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:42.303
that girl's map.

143
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.370
<v 1>[Inaudible] the range of consent and what is no,</v>

144
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:49.630
I wish I was taught more about sex, not being such a shameful thing.

145
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.410
<v 0>For women.</v>
