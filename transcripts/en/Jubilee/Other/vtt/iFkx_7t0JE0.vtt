00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.640
<v 0>Never have I ever, but</v>

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.830
never have I ever had a threesome? Wow.

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.740
Hi everyone. My name is June. I am an actor MC comedian on Instagram,

4
00:00:13.741 --> 00:00:15.900
and I make a lot of short form comedy skits.

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.850
One thing I do genuinely love to do is pair people up. I love playing matchmaker

6
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:23.670
called love lap,

7
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.230
where I bring on two contestants and make them spend 24 hours together on a

8
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:32.160
virtual game. You heard me correctly, 24 hours together.

9
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.370
Could I have possibly tapped into something 24 hours?

10
00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:40.080
Beat the perfect concussions to the finding the love of your life. We'll see.

11
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:44.783
All right, what's your name?

12
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.670
<v 1>I adjourn. I'm drew. Hi,</v>

13
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.480
I'm drew I'm 24 now. Jesus.

14
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.310
I'm an animator. This has got a geeky, but I have like a Google doc set up.

15
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.320
It should be like, okay, if we run out of activities,

16
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.440
but Tensley stuff we could do kind of romantic.

17
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.290
I like that for what I'm looking for in a partner. Ideally,

18
00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:08.090
it'd be nice to have someone else. Who's also nerdy, geeky as I am.

19
00:01:08.091 --> 00:01:11.630
Definitely someone who's ambitious. Hi. Hi. Nice to meet you.

20
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.700
<v 2>Hi, my name is Jordan Chan. I'm 21 years old and I am currently unemployed.</v>

21
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.380
Thanks to coronavirus. What I'm looking for in a partner in a romantic context,

22
00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:25.100
I guess would be somebody who has a good sense of humor.

23
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.080
Somebody who's spontaneous and somebody who's sincere. How was your banter game?

24
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.760
Oh, please.

25
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.090
<v 0>Just hold off.</v>

26
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.980
<v 2>I really love getting to know new people. So I'm really excited,</v>

27
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.550
but obviously I'm rather nervous as well, but that's just like it.

28
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.170
That's inevitable.

29
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.480
<v 0>First. I'll bring in. True next. We'll bring in Jordan. Well,</v>

30
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.250
Jordan, this is true. True. This is Jordan. Say hello.

31
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.413
Hi.

32
00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.380
<v 2>You guys are going to go there.</v>

33
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.910
<v 0>Without further ado. I'm going to let you guys go.</v>

34
00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:04.910
And your 24 hour starts now.

35
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.110
<v 1>Oh my God. Jordan.</v>

36
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.020
<v 2>Nice to meet you too.</v>

37
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.940
<v 1>Nervous all the way up to this. Like I was talking to Judy about it,</v>

38
00:02:16.941 --> 00:02:18.530
but like I couldn't sleep last night.

39
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.880
<v 2>Obviously. We're going to get to know each other fairly well.</v>

40
00:02:22.881 --> 00:02:24.890
Every 24 hours is a very long time.

41
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.440
<v 1>It's going to be a lot of awkward silence.</v>

42
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.440
<v 2>It's okay. You know, we'll just roll through it. Like it's all good.</v>

43
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.243
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

44
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.690
There's the first moment of silence.

45
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.110
<v 2>Hey guy. Sweet. Are you all getting hungry?</v>

46
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.610
I think it's time to share a first meal show your table that you have in your

47
00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:57.530
fridge. I'm going to eat on my front lawn. We're going to have a virtual picnic.

48
00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.443
I'm feeling.

49
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.760
<v 1>I feel like a weird cooking show. Now.</v>

50
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.770
<v 2>Pretend you're on a cooking show. Go.</v>

51
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.420
<v 1>So I take these and then put in so normal</v>

52
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.553
this Crick stuff,

53
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.510
but then a little bit of cinnamon and some almond milk and then put in half a

54
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:17.344
scoop away for it.

55
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.330
<v 2>So healthy master chef over here.</v>

56
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.840
<v 1>Sure. Cheers to her virtual picnic.</v>

57
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.880
<v 2>I'm going to go for a coffee and there's this couple who's like on a date and</v>

58
00:03:29.881 --> 00:03:33.000
they're simply so hard right now. They're both like holding hands. Like

59
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.700
how do you feel about PDA?

60
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.630
I'm normally not like a gushy person in general.

61
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.280
<v 1>I mean, like I like romcoms and romcoms. I can stand in your life.</v>

62
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.970
It's different. I don't know. There's a certain amount of cheese, but like, yes.

63
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.250
Have I hit any of your red flags?

64
00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.050
Uh, not yet. Hey Jordan,

65
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.920
how are you?

66
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.530
<v 2>Okay. How are you? I've been.</v>

67
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.860
<v 1>Anxiously waiting. Um, how was lunch?</v>

68
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.760
<v 2>It was good. I had, we had a picnic.</v>

69
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.220
<v 1>First impressions.</v>

70
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.040
<v 2>I mean, he's, he's cool.</v>

71
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.660
He's he's he seems like a really chill dude, but I,

72
00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:26.310
I don't know if like we're compatible on a romantic level.

73
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.870
<v 1>I feel like she's just as open and honest and upfront.</v>

74
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.490
Like we both can easily talk about, uh, I guess anything with our lives.

75
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.850
<v 2>I don't know. He seems really easy to talk to.</v>

76
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.260
He seems really relaxed and he's really, I don't know.

77
00:04:43.261 --> 00:04:45.570
I like talking to him. He's like, he seems like a really good guy.

78
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.150
<v 1>I think she's probably a little out of my league, but uh,</v>

79
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.490
I think it's really cool. Jabu

80
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.540
how into fashion. Oh, I'm very into perfect.

81
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.670
So I was thinking we could give each other like themes of like a fashion

82
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.580
outfit or something and you can be like, what's your favorite outfit?

83
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.720
<v 2>Oh, cute. That's so cute. So cute.</v>

84
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.580
Let's do something really loud. Okay. Ooh,

85
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.420
you look like you're going to the club kind of same vibe kind of say,

86
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.790
Ooh, Oh my God. Ooh.

87
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.860
<v 1>I love that this shoes are phenomenal. I do the wave a lot.</v>

88
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.020
You go to a club and everyone's grinding and he's like grinding.

89
00:05:31.021 --> 00:05:35.190
So pouring like, okay, like, sure. Like it's stimulating whatever sex,

90
00:05:35.191 --> 00:05:38.010
but like I want to do like cringey spins and escape. You know,

91
00:05:38.011 --> 00:05:39.960
like you have to give me yours.

92
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.290
<v 2>Your Instagram feed really reminds me of my ex.</v>

93
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.230
<v 1>That's good. That was the impression I'm wanting to go.</v>

94
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.990
Professional glitter sheets.

95
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.550
No telling me that this isn't professional.

96
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.100
I think you're really sweet. I don't know. You seem like.

97
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.330
<v 2>A very kind person.</v>

98
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.750
<v 1>[Inaudible] yeah. You're Cynthia.</v>

99
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.120
Um, I'll, I'll go with the very simple response, but um,

100
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.470
I think you're really pretty. I think it's pretty dope, I guess.

101
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.140
<v 2>Hey guys, it's me June. It's five o'clock somewhere.</v>

102
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.660
Oh, are y'all down for a happy hour? Drink up. Hell yeah. I'm going to.

103
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.030
<v 1>Give you the choice of what I'm going to be drinking.</v>

104
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.240
<v 2>Tonight. Tequila jurors, chairs, clink.</v>

105
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:37.000
Never have I ever gone to work high ever.

106
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.020
Never have I ever had a threesome? Wow.

107
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.360
I'm a little tipsy. So I'm not sure. I think it's approaching hour seven.

108
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.820
The more I talked to him, the more I like. Yeah, it's cool.

109
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.460
<v 1>I feel like we're really getting to know each other on a deeper level.</v>

110
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.940
Of course won't be like a fourth of the way through this 24 hour date.

111
00:06:57.941 --> 00:07:00.020
So I think you should give me a list of,

112
00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:04.240
of three possible friends or you'd need just give me one friend and I'm going to

113
00:07:04.241 --> 00:07:07.600
call that friend, put myself on mute. Ask them to describe you too.

114
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.340
<v 2>Awesome. Okay.</v>

115
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:17.440
<v 1>Hi Maria. This is uh, drew. This is the random dude that,</v>

116
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.760
uh, Jordan just told you about.

117
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:23.140
I figured I give you the chance just to tell me about Jordan.

118
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.320
<v 2>He's just nodding.</v>

119
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:41.110
<v 1>Cool. Uh, thanks Mario. I appreciate you taking this random call.</v>

120
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:50.680
<v 2>I want you to tell me why he would be a good person to date and also why</v>

121
00:07:50.681 --> 00:07:52.390
he would not be a good person to date

122
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.400
a good person today. He's extremely loyal

123
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.300
in terms of like his bad side, the

124
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.810
green money. Uh, pretty funny, kind of funny.

125
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:17.350
Okay. Thank you, Amber. It was nice chatting with you. That was interesting.

126
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:22.390
<v 1>That was fun. And also nerve wracking. Hi,</v>

127
00:08:22.391 --> 00:08:23.224
what's your name?

128
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:28.120
<v 2>I'm Jordan. Jordan to meet you guys.</v>

129
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.500
Okay. I dare you to do your makeup or have your, Oh my God.

130
00:08:32.501 --> 00:08:34.150
Have your girl room. I do your makeup.

131
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.060
Can I give you some inspo? I only have Island,

132
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:45.250
but go for it. Oh, you don't have any eye shadow or lipstick. Uh,

133
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.460
I might have some lip gloss,

134
00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:50.830
maybe pop that sucker out.

135
00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.680
And this is the finished look. Amazing. Incredible.

136
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.920
And I want you to put on some makeup,

137
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.660
like raccoon eyes. I told you I will do any hair.

138
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.560
This is so fad.

139
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:20.280
He doesn't have fragile masculinity, which is like,

140
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:26.610
yeah, he's not afraid to, you know, look like a fool and goof off.

141
00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:29.810
<v 1>We've mashed up a little bit with our sense of humor, which is nice.</v>

142
00:09:29.811 --> 00:09:32.120
And you can actually banter back and forth, which I think is important.

143
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.540
I think I'm pretty compatible. We'll see how she feels.

144
00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:42.560
<v 2>Okay. Making PV and J Hey, Skippy's Skippy.</v>

145
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.173
Cheers.

146
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:52.130
<v 1>A romantic dinner. So we got to have a candle if there's a romantic dinner.</v>

147
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:52.791
<v 2>Well, all right,</v>

148
00:09:52.791 --> 00:09:57.380
I'm going to let some candles to who or what might have stopped you from

149
00:09:57.381 --> 00:10:00.890
realizing your full potential. Oh. We're going deep.

150
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:06.310
We're always our own worst enemies. We're we're always our worst critics.

151
00:10:06.311 --> 00:10:08.540
So I feel like the person who holds me back the most is me.

152
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.600
<v 1>Is there a specific moment where you feel like you held yourself back?</v>

153
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.120
<v 2>There've been myriad times in my life where I've not taken advantage of</v>

154
00:10:17.121 --> 00:10:21.520
opportunities presented for me because I'm like, Oh,

155
00:10:21.521 --> 00:10:24.350
you're not good enough to do that. Anyway. Might as well, not even try,

156
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:25.610
you know, what about you?

157
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.010
<v 1>This is like, it's kind of oddly specific,</v>

158
00:10:28.011 --> 00:10:32.570
but it's like a moment in sixth grade where I kind of began more focusing within

159
00:10:32.571 --> 00:10:34.220
myself and not being as social.

160
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:39.290
So I feel like if I had a little more of that time to be able to

161
00:10:39.291 --> 00:10:40.400
socialize and learn,

162
00:10:40.401 --> 00:10:45.170
it would have helped a lot later years where I wasn't as socially developed or

163
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.440
was more socially awkward and had to learn when everyone else had already

164
00:10:48.441 --> 00:10:50.810
figured out social cues and all that kind of stuff.

165
00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:54.320
How are you feeling?

166
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:55.371
<v 2>I mean,</v>

167
00:10:55.371 --> 00:11:00.050
I'm honestly pleasantly surprised because I really thought there would be more

168
00:11:00.051 --> 00:11:04.760
awkwardness, but it's maybe really the organic conversation.

169
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:09.560
So you guys drink a little bit tipsy at all? Yeah. I got drunk.

170
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:15.140
You got drunk. Okay. Did it go up a few points? Well, yeah.

171
00:11:15.141 --> 00:11:18.980
You know what? The more I talked to him, the more I liked him, he seems like,

172
00:11:18.981 --> 00:11:22.430
you know, from our previous talk, you've loosened up a little bit.

173
00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:26.030
Are you saying I was uptight before? No. Come up,

174
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.640
give him a little bit of a chance. Give him a little bit, a little bit.

175
00:11:28.641 --> 00:11:32.070
And it seems like, it seems like you have, so I'm just,

176
00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:36.440
I was open-minded you find yourself a little more attracted to her just as a

177
00:11:36.441 --> 00:11:39.320
person or romantically? Yeah.

178
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.870
<v 1>I mean, I, I think from the get go,</v>

179
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:45.650
I said in my diary that I think she's sadly pretty.

180
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:49.430
<v 2>Much a gentleman.</v>

181
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.580
<v 1>And uh, honestly a little out of my league, but wow.</v>

182
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.390
<v 3>We'll just go and let that show, man. It was my pitch.</v>

183
00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:04.170
<v 2>Every time we laugh, we have to drink. Okay. Ready?</v>

184
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.070
Three, two, one.

185
00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:21.300
I know all the lyrics.

186
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:34.100
We're about to do a virtual room door, the door, the towel,

187
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:39.750
because I'm loud. My mirror, my bucket hats,

188
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.550
my keyboard, my raisin bran, my knitting supplies.

189
00:12:44.551 --> 00:12:48.750
My vinyl records, my photo albums, my book.

190
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.233
Yeah.

191
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:56.550
<v 3>My door VR had set first closet all filled with</v>

192
00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:00.390
all of my crazy button ups that I have. This, uh,

193
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.760
is definitely a deal breaker for a lot of people.

194
00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:07.470
This is my pet I've had since I was six and

195
00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:10.530
he's grown up with me. So he's definitely kind of an essential,

196
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.620
this is my snake. Oh my God.

197
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.290
<v 2>I totally forgot. He had a snake.</v>

198
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.300
<v 3>So how do you feel about snakes? I guess.</v>

199
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.930
<v 2>I mean, I don't like the,</v>

200
00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.090
I don't have an opinion on them.

201
00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:37.290
Like they're cool, but yeah, I'm not crazy.

202
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.330
Can you take your snake out? Do you want me to?

203
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:45.930
You're an interesting fellow.

204
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.033
Oh my God.

205
00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:59.460
Oh my God. That's so weird. Our.

206
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.200
<v 3>Yeah, this dude's pretty normal hour 13. Did I get.</v>

207
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.660
<v 2>I I'm going to admit it. I'm a very difficult person to date.</v>

208
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.020
So I have major clinical depression.

209
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:18.630
And so I know that's obviously a difficult thing to tackle when you're

210
00:14:18.631 --> 00:14:21.810
dating somebody. So usually when I have depressive episodes,

211
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.830
I tend to retreat. I don't like asking other people for help.

212
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:30.120
<v 3>Unfortunately, I'm exactly the same way. I mean, obviously I don't,</v>

213
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.210
I can't to on clinical depression,

214
00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:37.380
I think I have mild depression definitely have anxiety, but uh,

215
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:40.260
when I have a problem or issue, I get really dark.

216
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:45.360
I like get off the grid and like completely want to handle it by myself.

217
00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:48.870
And it's like, I don't want anyone else trying to come from me to talk to me.

218
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.830
<v 2>Each other or a picture that you think represents you,</v>

219
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:09.140
your eyeliner, your mascara and your spiky hair.

220
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.320
This is you writing your pet lizard into war.

221
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:17.330
It took you that long to draw. Shut up. I told you I'm bad at drawing.

222
00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.410
<v 3>There was one day I was really craving.</v>

223
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:25.990
I didn't have anything to eat the Manny's with. So I ate to me

224
00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:31.180
what a combination. How did it taste? First of all,

225
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:34.263
as we went on,

226
00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:39.040
I was able to back pedal away from that and tear down the wall a little more.

227
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:43.990
I don't really see the purpose in trying to put on a

228
00:15:43.991 --> 00:15:48.580
mask and pretend to be this perfect ideal version of myself for what a

229
00:15:48.581 --> 00:15:53.380
man expects a woman should be what hours it is almost

230
00:15:53.381 --> 00:15:54.214
3:00 AM.

231
00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:00.483
17.

232
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.070
Uh, I don't know.

233
00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:12.820
<v 2>Okay. If you believe hard enough, you can walk on water.</v>

234
00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:16.240
And me being like a 10 year old kid, I was like, that's dope.

235
00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.000
I can walk on water if I just believe in Jesus.

236
00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:23.260
But when I was a kid, that story free to meet them.

237
00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:28.360
When you're a kid, you're going to set the scary stories.

238
00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.570
Our 21, our 21.

239
00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:37.690
What are your bad habits?

240
00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:42.940
Staying up 24 hours going out

241
00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:46.930
virtually for 24 hours. Great.

242
00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:52.360
The only cereal I will eat is reason for him. I refuse to eat any other cereal.

243
00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:54.850
Cereal. Okay.

244
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:05.823
<v 3>Jordan.</v>

245
00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:20.110
So bundled up now. It's cute. But also like falling asleep.

246
00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:32.680
Star Wars, Harry Potter, Harry Potter,

247
00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:36.250
Potter, Harry Potter, Harry Potter.

248
00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:40.180
I don't know anything about Harry Potter. You fool.

249
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.990
<v 2>Take one. I am</v>

250
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:53.580
exhausted. I don't recall anything. We talked about this past week.

251
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:58.970
<v 1>I've had a fun time so far. It's it's felt, I mean, it's been exactly a day,</v>

252
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.200
but it's felt more than a day.

253
00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.820
It's felt like we've gone through multiple phases of ourselves.

254
00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.020
Random tired. I'm on Palm sewed hired.

255
00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.830
<v 0>Uh, Jordan, Jordan, you there?</v>

256
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:21.050
Good morning.

257
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:26.180
So how was, how was your night.

258
00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:30.470
<v 2>Super tiring for the last two hours a week or the last three hours?</v>

259
00:18:30.471 --> 00:18:34.160
We were both so exhausted. We weren't even really talking.

260
00:18:34.161 --> 00:18:35.960
We were just kind of like rambling.

261
00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.840
<v 0>Is there any sparks on your end?</v>

262
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.230
<v 2>The more I talked to him Memorial, like, and like,</v>

263
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:47.390
I like it now and he seems really chill and he's very, I don't know.

264
00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:48.403
It was really nice.

265
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:53.660
He was a delight to hang out with.

266
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:59.180
I don't think that this is going to necessarily blossom

267
00:18:59.181 --> 00:19:04.070
into anything like a relationship. Yeah.

268
00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:08.240
<v 0>That it's been pretty much a full 24 hours. How do you,</v>

269
00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.930
how do you feel, do you feel differently? Do you feel the same?

270
00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.990
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, I feel like my first impression has stayed pretty consistent.</v>

271
00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:19.370
I like her a lot. Really cool. Really cute,

272
00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:23.060
awesome general all around favorites.

273
00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.890
I think we have a lot of good similarities,

274
00:19:27.891 --> 00:19:29.630
but also as we were saying, I think,

275
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:32.690
I think we have like the differences as well. Um,

276
00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:35.300
and I think both are important.

277
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:39.920
<v 0>So if I were to offer you guys a second date,</v>

278
00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:45.260
everything paid for both parties have to go in knowing and agree that this is

279
00:19:45.261 --> 00:19:49.100
kind of a romantic second date. Would you take that?

280
00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:52.700
<v 1>Yeah, a hundred percent. I'd definitely like to go on a second day with her.</v>

281
00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:54.590
<v 0>What'd you go on a second date?</v>

282
00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:01.430
<v 2>Romantic. You can be straight up. There's nothing wrong with him.</v>

283
00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:05.930
Like, I'm just like, I don't he's so Simpy like, I don't know.

284
00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.210
<v 0>Hey, what's wrong with that? What if, what if he treats you? Well, you know,</v>

285
00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:11.810
it's just.

286
00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:13.610
<v 2>Not my type. Like okay.</v>

287
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:18.500
<v 0>If I'm hearing you correctly, is that a no.</v>

288
00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:24.190
<v 2>You have to be romantic in a casual sense. Okay. Okay.</v>

289
00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.760
<v 1>So Jordan, here's my pitch. I'd like, do you want a second day with you?</v>

290
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.910
I'd like to go somewhere where we can meet in person.

291
00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:36.740
So I was thinking we could get COVID tests. We could go, uh,

292
00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:41.630
after that go on a hike or nature somewhere Angeles forest,

293
00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.080
watch the sunset or whatever. Just sent out.

294
00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.040
I about that. I go on a.

295
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.180
<v 3>Date with me and can we do a social distance?</v>

296
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:57.490
Sure. Yeah. Okay, cool. Yeah.

297
00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:01.600
Is it weird asking somebody on a date in front of other people?

298
00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:04.210
Very weird.

299
00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:09.330
<v 0>Chemistry is that chemical and emotional interaction that two people have and</v>

300
00:21:09.331 --> 00:21:13.410
it's just there. You can't really pinpoint it. And when you feel it, you know,

301
00:21:13.411 --> 00:21:17.580
it's genuine juicing a little bit more consistent Jordan. On the other hand,

302
00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.560
I don't know if she was really feeling him romantically. Might not to say that.

303
00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:27.090
Sorry. Will they go on a second date? Was there chemistry there?

304
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:30.810
Who knows? So next time we'll see you. Thank you for tuning into love floods.

305
00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:36.360
<v 1>I'm just so uncomfortable. I'm through this right now.</v>

306
00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:41.730
I am fully closed. Thanks.

307
00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:46.620
Ma'am we're on our second date here as I pitched to beach

308
00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:51.660
Rainbird and I'm about to jump in the water, which is why I'm sharing this.
