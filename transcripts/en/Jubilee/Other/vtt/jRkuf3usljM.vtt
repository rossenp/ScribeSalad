00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.290
<v 0>More recently, I did have a hate account on Instagram. They, um,</v>

2
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.940
like told me to kill myself and told me that I like was ugly and I looked like a

3
00:00:16.941 --> 00:00:20.660
clown, but then I realized they're only making fun of me because I'm giving them

4
00:00:20.661 --> 00:00:21.494
attention about it.

5
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.680
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

6
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.670
<v 0>I'm a pro social media because I like to send meme. So my grandma,</v>

7
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.220
I like to keep connected with my friends. But most importantly,

8
00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:36.320
I think it's a useful platform and tool.

9
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.580
I didn't know what a trans guy was before I was on tech talk.

10
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.810
I just thought it was like a masculine girl.

11
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.660
<v 2>Of social media, but like, I don't use them.</v>

12
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.320
I kind of just have enough posts that doesn't make me seem like a loser

13
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.590
Really toxic because everything's based off numbers.

14
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.370
I just want to see how it pro social media has helped their life because it

15
00:01:04.371 --> 00:01:06.380
hasn't really helped me as a person.

16
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.390
I'm a content creator on talk Instagram, Snapchat.

17
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.630
I would say that I would make like 30 to $40,000 a month.

18
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.280
I'm anti-social media because of the present algorithms.

19
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.190
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.550
<v 2>No,</v>

21
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.320
I think Tik TOK is because it's manipulating their users and taking so much

22
00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:29.990
information from them. And they're showing that through the,

23
00:01:29.991 --> 00:01:31.040
for you page and people.

24
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.963
<v 1>I don't care.</v>

25
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.910
[inaudible].

26
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:41.750
<v 2>Hi, I'm Alexa,</v>

27
00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:45.740
I'm 18 years old and I'm pro social media and I love social media just because

28
00:01:45.741 --> 00:01:46.790
of the culture it brings.

29
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.370
<v 0>Hi, I'm Phillips plural.</v>

30
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.810
I am on the pro side and I just like to spread awareness.

31
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.720
I'm Alex, I'm 16.

32
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.640
I'm on Instagram tech talk and a little bit of YouTube and I am pro social media

33
00:02:01.641 --> 00:02:05.600
because it helped me meet a lot of other trans kids when I was struggling.

34
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.130
<v 2>Hi, I'm Ella,</v>

35
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.080
I'm 15 and I'm anti-social media because I find it really toxic and competitive

36
00:02:12.081 --> 00:02:16.820
for myself. Hi, I'm Emma, I'm 18 and I am anti-social media.

37
00:02:16.821 --> 00:02:20.180
And I'm the CEO of a movement that works to kind of promote a healthier

38
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.120
existence on social media. My name.

39
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.900
<v 0>Ms. Emmy I'm 16 I'm anti-social media because of personal</v>

40
00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:28.870
experience and like general things.

41
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.093
<v 1>Social</v>

42
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.283
media.

43
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.500
<v 2>I definitely find myself scrolling for hours when I'm bored and I definitely get</v>

44
00:02:54.501 --> 00:02:55.880
sucked in and I can't stop.

45
00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.190
<v 0>For me. Um, a lot of my school stuff got pushed to media, although.</v>

46
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.090
<v 3>Clubs and orgs. Another one that's more personal than me is that, um,</v>

47
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.560
keeps you in touch with your family. All my family's in Vietnam. So yeah. Yeah.

48
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:09.610
And a lot of my friends are on it.

49
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.790
<v 0>Um, just like on their accounts, you know,</v>

50
00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:14.970
like hyping them up or just like texting them on Instagram. Cause I don't,

51
00:03:14.971 --> 00:03:15.804
I don't like to use it.

52
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.180
<v 2>It's definitely my number one source of entertainment.</v>

53
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.810
I don't watch as much YouTube or Netflix and I kind of just go through tick talk

54
00:03:21.811 --> 00:03:26.130
and like that's what brings me joy sometimes. Yeah. Yeah.

55
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.140
Short attention spans. Oh yeah.

56
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.570
You get sucked in like you go on for like 30 minutes and then you're just there

57
00:03:30.571 --> 00:03:32.340
forever. And that happens to me all the time,

58
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.670
but sometime I spend more time comparing myself to others. Oh,

59
00:03:35.671 --> 00:03:38.880
I'm not getting that many likes and it kind of brings me down. But um,

60
00:03:38.881 --> 00:03:42.660
if I went on to talk and I kind of just analyzed everyone and just was like

61
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.270
trying to compare myself, then it would definitely bring me down.

62
00:03:45.271 --> 00:03:47.790
But just as a content creator, I just have the mindset of like, Oh,

63
00:03:47.791 --> 00:03:49.890
this is what you make. And maybe I can make it differently.

64
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.420
Prior to a movement. I started called logoff.

65
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.800
I spent about five hours on social media day and it was to talk with my sister

66
00:04:01.801 --> 00:04:06.000
who was in college, but I also got really bad repercussions about my body.

67
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.730
And I felt really terrible after scrolling. But you know,

68
00:04:08.731 --> 00:04:11.400
after I rethought about how I wanted to spend my time on there,

69
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.120
it became much more productive. So I still spend time on like Instagram.

70
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.810
It's just to like get a meme from my college sister or to like talk with friends

71
00:04:18.811 --> 00:04:20.070
that really bring me up. I have.

72
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.470
<v 0>I have an Instagram, I have a Tech-Talk,</v>

73
00:04:22.471 --> 00:04:27.180
but like I never opened the app like ever I'm clearly not the skinniest.

74
00:04:27.181 --> 00:04:30.150
And like I have alopecia, so I'm losing my hair and like,

75
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.890
I'll look on social media and like,

76
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.240
I'll see some like K-pop star and they're like a double zero with the longest

77
00:04:36.241 --> 00:04:39.240
hair on the planet. And they're like, see like their skin is silk smooth.

78
00:04:39.241 --> 00:04:41.700
And when I take pictures, no matter what I do,

79
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.010
you can see the whites of my scalp.

80
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.310
So I don't take photos and cause I don't take photos.

81
00:04:47.311 --> 00:04:49.530
I don't have anything to post and because I don't have anything to post,

82
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.540
I don't see a point in opening the app. Plus I'd rather spend my time reading.

83
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.890
<v 3>Well, I used to be more, um, meek and mild. I was just like, Oh no,</v>

84
00:04:58.891 --> 00:05:01.680
they're going to comment. I'm oddly. And they're going to hate on me. But then,

85
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.690
um, the one tick talks started blowing up.

86
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.020
One of my videos blew up and I was just like, Hey, they don't hate me.

87
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.540
And I was just like, Oh, okay. The confidence that's coming in.

88
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.630
<v 2>And I get a hundred notifications a day from my best friend saying,</v>

89
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.480
I found this new video you would love and I'll click on it occasionally.

90
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.190
And I love the video cause it's funny,

91
00:05:17.191 --> 00:05:19.530
it's short and it like matches my personality,

92
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.770
but it makes me really upset when like I faced him with my friend and she's

93
00:05:22.771 --> 00:05:23.670
scrolling through tech talk.

94
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.120
It's really scary to see my friends kind of disconnect with me and just connect

95
00:05:27.121 --> 00:05:28.350
with these people. They've never met

96
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.130
That were narcs and that we kind of hate social media.

97
00:05:38.131 --> 00:05:39.420
Like parents hate social media.

98
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.960
I don't think they really know our stories and know why exactly we don't want to

99
00:05:42.961 --> 00:05:45.000
exist on the platforms and the way that they are.

100
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.850
I've had hurtful things posted about me. And the thing about the internet it's,

101
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.330
it's there forever and it's not like a word that was just said to me on the

102
00:05:51.331 --> 00:05:54.330
playground. It's something that's out there and other people can see.

103
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:06.100
<v 3>Okay.</v>

104
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.500
<v 2>There can be communities found within social media,</v>

105
00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.340
but my personal experience with it and from a lot of stories that I've heard

106
00:06:12.341 --> 00:06:15.730
through logoff is that a lot of kids have lost people because of social media.

107
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.600
And I think that that constant mindless scrolling allows you to kind of go into

108
00:06:19.601 --> 00:06:22.690
this bubble and just hunker down and to not really talk with people.

109
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.040
I know a bunch of kids that like.

110
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.910
<v 4>Don't know how to communicate outside of like an emoji or like outside of like a</v>

111
00:06:27.911 --> 00:06:28.541
picture,

112
00:06:28.541 --> 00:06:31.870
like only have one picture face and like will repeatedly take the same black.

113
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.170
We'll stop everyone in the friend group to pick a wall and just sit there and

114
00:06:35.171 --> 00:06:37.810
pose and take a hundred photos and stand there and wait, it doesn't matter.

115
00:06:37.811 --> 00:06:38.644
I'll take one more.

116
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:43.030
<v 2>I definitely like would base like entire friend groups to hang out and just take</v>

117
00:06:43.031 --> 00:06:44.650
pictures. Like we wouldn't communicate,

118
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.420
it would just be pictures just to post on Instagram.

119
00:06:46.421 --> 00:06:48.070
And then I would find myself that like,

120
00:06:48.071 --> 00:06:49.840
we didn't even connect when we were hanging out.

121
00:06:49.841 --> 00:06:51.910
It wasn't quality time because I feel like, Oh,

122
00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:53.410
I have to get that perfect photo of all of us,

123
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.590
all of us looking like we're having fun. Even if we're not,

124
00:06:56.591 --> 00:06:58.210
I just need to get that so I can post it.

125
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.270
<v 3>After a while you feel the pressure and everything,</v>

126
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.170
people start being people and they're just empty profile pictures.

127
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.390
People will come to me and they won't know my name.

128
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.590
They'll go by my screen name. And then I'm just like, am I human?

129
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:18.130
<v 4>I like to ask questions in comments and ask like, Oh, where'd you get that?</v>

130
00:07:18.131 --> 00:07:21.040
Or you know, like what hair dye did you use? Or something like that.

131
00:07:21.041 --> 00:07:25.360
Because I think it's a lot more engaging or I like to remember, I'll make my,

132
00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:27.490
like my posts I'll make it a question.

133
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:32.260
Like the caption I like to interact with like a lot of my followers through

134
00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.200
comments because I'm uncomfortable, you know, messaging them personally.

135
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.600
It's good to like interact with the people that support you. Yeah.

136
00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.720
<v 2>But what would you say to like bigger influencers? Like Kylie Jenner,</v>

137
00:07:40.721 --> 00:07:43.570
like Kim Kardashian that camp and have that interaction via the comments.

138
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.300
<v 3>Yeah. And then Alex, some people just don't even reply to those.</v>

139
00:07:46.301 --> 00:07:48.070
Just double tap, like the message.

140
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.860
<v 2>Going off, what you said about like making real human connection.</v>

141
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.710
And now have you ever like looked into like social media accounts that like

142
00:07:53.711 --> 00:07:57.130
promote that? Cause I don't know if you guys know, we're not really strangers.

143
00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.530
If you guys know them, they have a card game, you know now. Okay.

144
00:07:59.531 --> 00:08:03.400
So it's basically a card game where you have perception analysis and then

145
00:08:03.401 --> 00:08:07.480
reflection and then you just have conversation, like how are you really? Or,

146
00:08:07.481 --> 00:08:09.730
you know, if it has like what's what do you,

147
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.550
what would you name the chapter of this in your life? And then boom,

148
00:08:12.551 --> 00:08:14.260
we're in a 20 minute conversation that like,

149
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.660
she feels really low and she's trying to change. And the, you know,

150
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:20.050
when I would have never thought that if this social media account didn't push me

151
00:08:20.051 --> 00:08:23.410
or did it and encourage me to have deeper conversations, I agree.

152
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:25.840
But I think the issue is with the algorithm in place.

153
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:28.240
Like that's not popping up on my feed. Like I'm not,

154
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.660
I don't know that those exist and because it's so expansive and because there's

155
00:08:31.661 --> 00:08:33.160
so much hollowness in mindless scrolling,

156
00:08:33.161 --> 00:08:36.160
like I've never found that if I found that I would have loved that with the

157
00:08:36.161 --> 00:08:38.650
algorithm and the fact that you never see those things that I always feel like

158
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.020
we're on a whole different side of tick-tock than you are.

159
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.680
And all it takes is just to look up like deep conversations on the internet.

160
00:08:44.681 --> 00:08:46.890
There would have been a Vogue article about we're not really friends and then

161
00:08:46.891 --> 00:08:49.510
you would have looked it up, you know? So in order to change your algorithm,

162
00:08:49.511 --> 00:08:51.300
you just have to change the things that you're looking for.

163
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.190
Don't you think maybe like the algorithm in place is what's making it so

164
00:08:54.191 --> 00:08:55.470
dangerous. Cause it's like,

165
00:08:55.471 --> 00:08:58.380
they're pumping out these really terrible kind of like content videos,

166
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.320
but also you've got like the attention economy where they're like fighting to

167
00:09:01.321 --> 00:09:03.420
get your information, to then give to people, to like,

168
00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:05.370
to put ads in your feed that you won't notice.

169
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.670
<v 4>If you're not on social media, you know, it's going to do that anyway.</v>

170
00:09:07.671 --> 00:09:09.320
Like if you're searching anything up,

171
00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.830
like if you're searching something up on Safari and you go onto your computer

172
00:09:12.831 --> 00:09:14.600
onto Chrome, the ads would probably be the same.

173
00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.600
<v 2>Just the internet technology. Yeah.</v>

174
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:21.230
<v 3>Um, I sat down here saying that social media makes people antisocial,</v>

175
00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.910
but hearing Alexa and Alex speak it makes me remember that, um, social media,

176
00:09:25.911 --> 00:09:29.660
isn't just, you know, the whole tick-tock scene. It's also schools,

177
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.100
there's clubs and stuff. Um,

178
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:34.550
I've made a couple of new friends from social media because um,

179
00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.650
they live in Ventura. I live in San Diego.

180
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.470
So I don't think it's necessarily just the whole big fame thing.

181
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.590
There's also the smaller group. Yeah.

182
00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:46.220
I'd like to say social media changed my life. I'm I'm more confident.

183
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.890
I actually think about what I wear. I used to just roll out bed,

184
00:09:48.891 --> 00:09:52.250
grab what's near. I do see how social media can be bad,

185
00:09:52.251 --> 00:09:54.800
but I like to think of it in a positive light.

186
00:09:58.850 --> 00:09:59.683
<v 2>Okay.</v>

187
00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.400
I know you guys remember like those musically days,

188
00:10:07.401 --> 00:10:10.460
I feel like that was my biggest bullying because it's like, when you're,

189
00:10:10.461 --> 00:10:12.290
it's just like entering a whole different society,

190
00:10:12.291 --> 00:10:14.030
it's just like we are going on. You're making videos.

191
00:10:14.031 --> 00:10:16.370
You don't really know what you want to post or what you want to do or what you

192
00:10:16.371 --> 00:10:17.180
want to look like.

193
00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.420
So it is going to be cringy at first and it's not going to be great musically.

194
00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.610
<v 4>Definitely a dark time. Um,</v>

195
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:26.810
more recently I did have a hate account on Instagram. They, um,

196
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.480
like told me to kill myself and told me that like,

197
00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:34.340
cause I was upset about my pet dying that I should kill myself and that I like

198
00:10:34.341 --> 00:10:38.030
was ugly and I looked like a clown and yeah, I really, really,

199
00:10:38.031 --> 00:10:41.000
really let it get to me for a long time. But then I realized, you know,

200
00:10:41.001 --> 00:10:44.510
like they're only making fun of me because I'm giving them attention about it.

201
00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:48.140
So I just had to like block them from all my accounts and block all the people

202
00:10:48.141 --> 00:10:51.230
they were following and block all the people that were following them.

203
00:10:51.231 --> 00:10:54.050
And then I just had to stop looking. And if I don't look at it,

204
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:55.130
then I don't know what they saying.

205
00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:59.020
<v 2>Right. And that's the thing. It's just like, once you stop looking into it,</v>

206
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.330
it's you just stop beating the fire and it will die eventually because you just

207
00:11:02.331 --> 00:11:04.250
don't even pay it. No mind. I don't have a big following.

208
00:11:04.251 --> 00:11:06.290
So it's basically mostly people. I know,

209
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.720
usually it's tech talks and it's not with my name in it,

210
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.830
but you can tell that it's implied towards me. And I try not to comment,

211
00:11:12.831 --> 00:11:15.590
but like there's some points where they're coming out and saying like completely

212
00:11:15.591 --> 00:11:19.190
false things about me posting and hating on someone through the internet is

213
00:11:19.191 --> 00:11:22.010
completely different from in-person because it's there forever.

214
00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.010
You don't have control over that because it's up to them to delete it.

215
00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:32.930
So I have had rude comments been made about me,

216
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:36.560
but I've never been like heavily cyber bullied because I don't really have a big

217
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:39.020
following. And because of the community that I'm in,

218
00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.750
I've just read hundreds of stories about kids who like,

219
00:11:41.751 --> 00:11:44.780
felt like they wanted to kill themselves because of the rude comments they were

220
00:11:44.781 --> 00:11:46.130
getting. And I just remember,

221
00:11:46.131 --> 00:11:48.860
like there were nights when I would cry and I'd be so upset because I couldn't

222
00:11:48.861 --> 00:11:49.810
really do anything about it.

223
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.010
<v 3>My cyber bullying experience the first like big one, I.</v>

224
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:58.270
<v 0>Was in like this like dance team. Right. And I was the shortest kid,</v>

225
00:11:58.271 --> 00:12:00.970
the fattest kid and like one of like three Asians.

226
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:05.050
So I clearly stuck out no matter what I did. And you know, like after practice,

227
00:12:05.051 --> 00:12:07.960
like all the girls would like do that like 2014, like out,

228
00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.750
like the duck face thing pose one day,

229
00:12:10.751 --> 00:12:12.760
like one of them like invited me to take the photo with them.

230
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.340
And I thought like, this was the only way you could pose on Instagram.

231
00:12:15.341 --> 00:12:19.210
So like I did it and then they took the photo and they were all like laughing

232
00:12:19.211 --> 00:12:21.880
and they started uploading it. I didn't know why over,

233
00:12:21.881 --> 00:12:23.380
like the next two and a half,

234
00:12:23.381 --> 00:12:26.020
three years they would continuously like bring me into the photo.

235
00:12:26.021 --> 00:12:27.820
Like I would never just go up. They'd always ask me, Hey,

236
00:12:27.821 --> 00:12:29.050
do you wanna be in the photo? You wanna be in the photo?

237
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:30.820
So I felt like I was being included,

238
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.240
but when I like got a phone and when I got an Instagram and when I started

239
00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:37.720
following like my fellow dance team members, I would look at their Instagrams.

240
00:12:37.721 --> 00:12:41.080
And like, from the beginning it's photos of me, they'll zoom in on me.

241
00:12:41.081 --> 00:12:44.110
And they'll be like, look at that fat thing, that gay monster, like,

242
00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:47.530
is it trying to pose? Like, what is like, what does that thing think?

243
00:12:47.531 --> 00:12:51.940
It is like, do they think they're cute? I wasn't like in elementary school,

244
00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:53.590
like, I don't know how to deal with myself.

245
00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.720
Like I barely know how to open a peanut butter jar.

246
00:12:55.721 --> 00:12:57.220
And you expect me to know how to deal with people,

247
00:12:57.221 --> 00:12:59.920
calling me it and like a monster. You know what I mean?

248
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.820
<v 2>Instagram, tic talk. Everything is the highlight reel my Instagram.</v>

249
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.760
I'm not going to post the ugliest picture of me when I scroll through my

250
00:13:17.761 --> 00:13:20.460
friends. I, in the back of my head, I should know that,

251
00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:23.550
but that's the same for them yet. I'm like, they look so pretty.

252
00:13:23.551 --> 00:13:26.610
Why do I not look like that? And I think for younger generations,

253
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.380
it's really scary that they're going to have to do.

254
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.560
<v 0>I have this one photo. That's so vivid in my memory. And like,</v>

255
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:35.700
I'm at like an aquarium and I'm leaning against like one of the fish tanks and

256
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:38.430
my dad and my dad and my brother next to me.

257
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:43.290
And I'm like half of my brother's height by face sagging my

258
00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.870
body. Like my clothes don't fit on me. And I'm like,

259
00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:50.040
at the time I didn't realize how depressed I wasn't home, how much these,

260
00:13:50.041 --> 00:13:52.380
like these like dance photos were ruining me.

261
00:13:52.381 --> 00:13:55.530
That's kind of when I knew like social media is not something I like,

262
00:13:55.531 --> 00:13:56.940
I'm not safe here. You know?

263
00:13:56.941 --> 00:14:00.690
And so an excuse I can make for not pleasing people online is that I don't use

264
00:14:00.691 --> 00:14:03.510
it. And then I'll be okay.

265
00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.210
<v 2>The, the bad thing about social media is like,</v>

266
00:14:06.211 --> 00:14:08.700
if you have a bad friend in real life and your mom's like avoid them,

267
00:14:08.701 --> 00:14:10.350
don't be nice to them and stuff. But on social media,

268
00:14:10.351 --> 00:14:13.830
you almost can't avoid them. And I feel like that's where like a lot,

269
00:14:13.831 --> 00:14:16.680
a lot of kids can get hurt because they comment rude things on your things,

270
00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.290
or they don't share the same opinions. And those friends are horrible. You know.

271
00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:21.570
<v 0>I don't know how Tumblr is now because I don't go on it.</v>

272
00:14:21.571 --> 00:14:25.470
But there are a lot of like self-harm pages and eating disorder pages with like

273
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.330
ideas to make yourself lose weight.

274
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.260
There's so much of that on Tumblr that I had to get off of tumbler. Um,

275
00:14:31.261 --> 00:14:35.040
and I think that definitely will hurt kids now. And in the future.

276
00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:37.490
<v 2>I just couldn't imagine being like 10 or 11 or 12,</v>

277
00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.710
just being so young and looking through this and taking all these suggestions in

278
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.990
I'm 18 now. Like I go through it and I know better,

279
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.270
but I feel like you could get seriously hurt when you're young,

280
00:14:45.271 --> 00:14:46.860
because you really just don't know any better.

281
00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:47.341
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

282
00:14:47.341 --> 00:14:50.580
I'll just play back on what you said about how little kids don't know better.

283
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:52.100
I hack where it was.

284
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.550
<v 3>Like scoop ice cream and then it said microwave, the spoon,</v>

285
00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.630
most children wouldn't know. Yeah. In cases like that,

286
00:14:59.631 --> 00:15:03.320
it does hurt me to be pro social media, but social media,

287
00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:06.830
I think it was always more intended for more discretion.

288
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:10.000
<v 4>Like I, I have this friend named Jesse Page and she is very,</v>

289
00:15:10.001 --> 00:15:14.830
very like pro body positivity and like pro like, like mental health, you know,

290
00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:16.840
like really like, I want to get better.

291
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:20.350
That's why I keep all my posts up because I want people to be able to go back

292
00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:24.550
and look, I wasn't on T for three years, you know, when I was out, you know,

293
00:15:24.551 --> 00:15:28.570
like I was fully out and like fighting for myself to start hormones, my friend,

294
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.920
Jesse too. She also puts before and after she always puts like,

295
00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:37.930
this is the real me a hundred percent.

296
00:15:37.931 --> 00:15:40.870
I don't think I would be the person I am. If it wasn't for social media,

297
00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.680
I first came out on tech talk and my parents didn't even know that's how they

298
00:15:44.681 --> 00:15:45.850
found out, actually.

299
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:46.833
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

300
00:15:58.420 --> 00:15:59.110
Well, um,

301
00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:02.800
it's kind of funny because I talked to a lot of organizations with logoff and

302
00:16:02.801 --> 00:16:05.710
the main point that they try to get across is that they're trying to advocate

303
00:16:05.711 --> 00:16:10.570
for kids to get cell phones and technology and social media at an older age. Um,

304
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.180
and you know, years ago I would've said that's really stupid.

305
00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:15.790
That's like the drug talk, like don't do drugs, don't be on social media.

306
00:16:15.791 --> 00:16:16.750
I'm not going to listen to that.

307
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:20.590
But then after years of kind of self-reflection, I wish someone would have said,

308
00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:22.870
you don't need Instagram to have a social life.

309
00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.180
If I go back to like my 13 year old self and like,

310
00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.330
I didn't have all the experiences I had and I just kinda knew like, Oh,

311
00:16:28.331 --> 00:16:33.220
it's a good place. I would be posting. God knows what. So yeah, kids are dumb.

312
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.640
And if you give kids a platform to do whatever they want,

313
00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:37.870
they're going to be dumb.

314
00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.350
There's no educational advocacy out there to actually allow for that to happen.

315
00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.190
And when they are there, it's this older teacher who like,

316
00:16:45.191 --> 00:16:48.340
has a completely different outlook on social media because they never existed in

317
00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:52.720
an age where it was your life. You know, I just feel like it's almost,

318
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:55.600
it's just unrealistic when I was 13, I was fully on social media,

319
00:16:55.601 --> 00:16:58.690
making videos every single day. So I just feel like if anything,

320
00:16:58.691 --> 00:17:00.190
it helped me more when I was 13. Like,

321
00:17:00.191 --> 00:17:03.220
it really allowed me to just know what things were and not be.

322
00:17:03.221 --> 00:17:06.130
So what is going on? Like, you know, not knowing a lot of things.

323
00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.110
<v 4>Because like I was on social media at like 11 years old,</v>

324
00:17:08.111 --> 00:17:12.490
like I was a child and on social media and my, my dad told me he was like,

325
00:17:12.491 --> 00:17:15.910
you know, but you're also trans. And you're also like LGBT, you know,

326
00:17:15.911 --> 00:17:19.270
you need to be able to meet people because your bubble that you would know of

327
00:17:19.271 --> 00:17:20.800
trans people would be zero.

328
00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:24.670
<v 3>Here's the thing. I think we're underestimating children. They're relentless.</v>

329
00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:28.390
And we put an age limit on Instagram or an age limit on like an adult type

330
00:17:28.391 --> 00:17:30.070
website. They're still going to get through.

331
00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.210
<v 2>I didn't have social media.</v>

332
00:17:31.211 --> 00:17:34.090
I was probably like the last couple people out of my like friends,

333
00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:38.320
because my mom knew the restrictions and how the things that are on the internet

334
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:42.310
is you can't control what other people are posting and you can't control what

335
00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:43.360
your kids are seeing.

336
00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:47.520
But I believe that like other kids mature at different ages and we can't really

337
00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.790
like restrict certain people going on this platform when it's public,

338
00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.060
it's difficult. Cause I,

339
00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:57.740
I do think what you said is true where if I was 13 and

340
00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:01.850
someone said you have to be 13 to get on this app or like, you have to be older.

341
00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:03.650
I would have lied about my age, my age.

342
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.150
And I know there are millions of kids like that that are like, he, he,

343
00:18:06.151 --> 00:18:08.600
he break the system and be like put in a different age. Okay.

344
00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:11.030
<v 3>See, that's the thing with any problem,</v>

345
00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.550
you can't just take the problem and move it over here.

346
00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.780
It's all about the education. It should be a class like how sex ed is.

347
00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:19.340
There should be like tech ed.

348
00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.550
<v 0>Pewter lab days exist. Like, was that just my school?</v>

349
00:18:22.551 --> 00:18:24.350
Like there were computer lab days or something. Yeah.

350
00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:26.840
<v 2>Where we just practice right now you practice typing. Well,</v>

351
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:30.340
instead of just practicing typing practice, how to not be an idiot online.

352
00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:33.770
<v 0>And like how to like learn and understand like the harm of it. Because like,</v>

353
00:18:33.771 --> 00:18:37.550
if I had that education, I know that like I would have like,

354
00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:42.650
at least braced myself for it. Once COVID kind of hit,

355
00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.770
I realized like I need social media or else.

356
00:18:45.771 --> 00:18:49.550
I can't like find anyone. I know some people that kind of think,

357
00:18:49.551 --> 00:18:51.770
like when I say that I don't use social media a lot. They're like, Oh,

358
00:18:51.771 --> 00:18:52.970
do you think you're cooler than us?

359
00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.370
Cause you don't need like social media validation,

360
00:18:55.850 --> 00:19:00.800
but it's more like I'm afraid of if I search for that validation that

361
00:19:00.801 --> 00:19:01.940
I'm not going to get it.

362
00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:14.690
<v 2>I know all schools,</v>

363
00:19:14.691 --> 00:19:18.590
they don't talk about some deep topics that social media brings slight and it

364
00:19:18.591 --> 00:19:21.440
teaches you and it teaches you how to get through it and how to do it without

365
00:19:21.441 --> 00:19:23.240
talking to your family, if you are uncomfortable.

366
00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.100
And without talking to the school,

367
00:19:25.101 --> 00:19:27.320
because sometimes schools don't have that education in place.

368
00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:32.360
<v 0>My teacher told everyone that RuPaul's drag race was a good example of trans</v>

369
00:19:32.361 --> 00:19:36.410
people. Of course, like I got in trouble for like correcting him or whatever,

370
00:19:36.411 --> 00:19:37.640
but it was like,

371
00:19:37.641 --> 00:19:41.390
I could not let him spread fake information like that because those are not

372
00:19:41.391 --> 00:19:44.720
trans people. Those are drag Queens. And that is a totally different topic.

373
00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:48.140
I'm very far in my transition for 16 and it,

374
00:19:48.141 --> 00:19:50.540
social media definitely helped me a lot.

375
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:51.110
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

376
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.920
And then the fact that you even got in trouble for that shows that school is

377
00:19:54.921 --> 00:19:56.420
that like, you know, they're lacking.

378
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.790
<v 2>You know, personal experience is how you learn the most. You know,</v>

379
00:19:58.791 --> 00:20:02.390
you go on social media and there's someone talking about this eating disorder,

380
00:20:02.391 --> 00:20:03.770
this depression that they went to,

381
00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.660
it's just someone actually talking to a camera,

382
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:07.790
giving you real advice at a school really can never do.

383
00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.790
I want to preface it with, I am kind of like, I'm very lucky. Um,

384
00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.290
the school that I go to Altima,

385
00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:17.990
it's like a private school in Alabama and they're very,

386
00:20:17.991 --> 00:20:21.350
very good with kind of integrating these conversations into the academic

387
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:23.870
dialogue. I totally agree with everything you all have said,

388
00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.320
I've learned how to rainbow loom and I've done a bunch of different things on

389
00:20:27.321 --> 00:20:28.154
social media,

390
00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.510
but I've also looked up like election and there has been misinformation after

391
00:20:32.511 --> 00:20:36.500
misinformation and with COVID. So for y'all that answered, how do you,

392
00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.620
how do you kind of outweigh like the chance to learn a bunch of new things with

393
00:20:39.621 --> 00:20:42.380
also the chance of seeing a lot of stuff that isn't necessarily true?

394
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:45.110
I think you just have to look for credible websites. I mean,

395
00:20:45.111 --> 00:20:47.860
it's just like when you're doing an essay, you wouldn't believe, uh,

396
00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:50.110
I'm just feel like blogs, any of that kind of stuff.

397
00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.060
It is easy to get a lot of misinformation,

398
00:20:52.061 --> 00:20:54.460
but it's also easy to see that this information is fake. Like,

399
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:57.040
but what about like a young kid that can't really discern that.

400
00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.270
<v 4>My dad actually, um,</v>

401
00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:04.350
put the Washington post and the New York times on my phone so that I would look

402
00:21:04.351 --> 00:21:06.480
at it more so I would get the notifications, you know,

403
00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.460
all I had to do with put it on my phone.

404
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:12.870
<v 2>Been times when I've disagreed with what the teacher said and that that is true.</v>

405
00:21:12.871 --> 00:21:16.530
But I also think that with social media, with the algorithm in place,

406
00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.600
it's harder to, harder to discern.

407
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:21.120
I disagree with you just because I feel like as kids,

408
00:21:21.121 --> 00:21:22.860
we look up to our teachers for the right answers.

409
00:21:22.861 --> 00:21:25.740
And if they are like providing like a bias answer,

410
00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:27.600
we're getting the wrong information. Yeah.

411
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:29.520
<v 3>If you've taken a political science class,</v>

412
00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:33.450
there will be times where the teacher's own political beliefs might make the

413
00:21:33.451 --> 00:21:37.080
learning bias. So comparable to social media, it's about the same.

414
00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:40.290
<v 2>I think it's more dangerous on social media because I agree it is very dangerous</v>

415
00:21:40.291 --> 00:21:43.140
in the classroom. Especially when you look up to teachers with the algorithm,

416
00:21:43.141 --> 00:21:46.230
they don't have that humanity for, to like, to actually discern like, Oh,

417
00:21:46.231 --> 00:21:49.650
this is an article about how Macs aren't important. So like,

418
00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.440
but I'm going to pump that out. But I would just say this,

419
00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:55.470
I would just say exact reason because,

420
00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.490
because it's just one human one way of life, one perspective, one thought,

421
00:21:59.491 --> 00:22:02.010
you know, but at least when you go on social media and you put up Trump,

422
00:22:02.011 --> 00:22:03.870
it's going to come up both sides of the story, you know,

423
00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.090
and it's up to you to differentiate and read it and see, okay,

424
00:22:06.091 --> 00:22:08.490
this comes from this credible website and this is coming from a blog on

425
00:22:08.491 --> 00:22:09.240
Wikipedia.

426
00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.940
<v 3>What if we're talking about like, just a straight forward thing, like math,</v>

427
00:22:11.941 --> 00:22:12.870
science, or English,

428
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:16.050
sometimes you can get like a cruddy teacher and they won't really teach you

429
00:22:16.051 --> 00:22:18.680
that. Well, it's just type that in social media lowering it.

430
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:21.750
<v 2>Like I've never actually been held by a math teacher. I mean,</v>

431
00:22:21.751 --> 00:22:24.810
photo math was the only thing that helped me. I mean, it's not even like,

432
00:22:24.811 --> 00:22:26.400
it only gave me the answers. I mean, you sweat,

433
00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:29.100
like you scrolled up and it really showed you step by step what it does.

434
00:22:29.101 --> 00:22:30.600
And you look for the reasoning. Here's the reason. Yeah.

435
00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:33.930
<v 4>And sometimes if I have a lot of trouble with like an assignment or something,</v>

436
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:36.660
I'll actually like post a picture of it and I'll be like, Hey,

437
00:22:36.661 --> 00:22:38.600
like I am really bad in this subject.

438
00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:41.040
Every single time people do message me and help me out.

439
00:22:41.041 --> 00:22:42.570
Or like will comment and be like, Hey,

440
00:22:42.571 --> 00:22:45.990
like actually this is what you're doing wrong. And this is how you do it. Right.

441
00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:55.163
<v 3>No.</v>

442
00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:01.530
<v 2>For me on a macro scale, I think there are some really, um,</v>

443
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:06.450
troubling signs that social media is kind of unwinding society and humanity

444
00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.430
in the sense of like the democracy debate,

445
00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:12.440
governments can use social media to then kind of undermine elections. Um,

446
00:23:12.441 --> 00:23:15.450
and I think those are bigger issues when you look at the macro scale, but again,

447
00:23:15.451 --> 00:23:16.284
on the micro scale,

448
00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:18.390
there are so many different people in the world that dive with it.

449
00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:19.800
I know other people that are like me,

450
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:22.890
I think I would thrive more without social media because I kind of,

451
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:26.100
I compare myself and I look for those likes and look for those comments on my

452
00:23:26.101 --> 00:23:28.260
posts. And I feel like if I didn't have that concern,

453
00:23:28.261 --> 00:23:31.470
my mental health and my self love and self image would be so much better if I

454
00:23:31.471 --> 00:23:32.790
didn't see all this stuff on the internet.

455
00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:36.300
<v 4>Part of me wants to ask for like a diff a definition for like thrive.</v>

456
00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:38.130
Cause like, are we talking about like us.

457
00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.100
<v 3>Human race or like people individually.</v>

458
00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:43.560
<v 4>Instagram and things who might put like, you make,</v>

459
00:23:43.561 --> 00:23:46.100
you have poor body image and this, that, but also in the case of like Alex.

460
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.600
<v 0>You know, it helps him, you know,</v>

461
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:50.840
meet other trans people and understand that like he isn't alone. Right.

462
00:23:50.841 --> 00:23:55.610
And so it's such a general question with so many variables that like,

463
00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.150
you can't just like put one answer down it's so case by case,

464
00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.250
you need to know if it's on the micro macro scale. And you know,

465
00:24:01.251 --> 00:24:04.100
like Alex has a following that is a lot of other trans kids are looking for

466
00:24:04.101 --> 00:24:07.430
other trans kids. And if Alex was one Mia for a month, people would panic,

467
00:24:07.431 --> 00:24:09.860
you know? And like, you know, like, I can totally like,

468
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:13.010
sorry to like keep using you. But like, like this is like the easiest, like,

469
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.170
like analogy, right. I'm sorry, Alex.

470
00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:19.600
<v 5>Just like the easiest example.</v>

471
00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:23.560
<v 4>Um, I have a question actually. Um, so I, in the recent months,</v>

472
00:24:23.561 --> 00:24:27.190
especially there have been a lot of protests and stuff that were like,

473
00:24:27.191 --> 00:24:29.020
a lot of them were created online.

474
00:24:29.021 --> 00:24:30.910
And I think that if we didn't have social media,

475
00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:34.780
a lot of them wouldn't have been possible because there wouldn't have been the

476
00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:36.130
word spread so fast.

477
00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:40.630
<v 0>I agree. Yes. These protests got really big and it's really important. But I,</v>

478
00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.870
the thing that I've kind of been looking at is the people that go and take a

479
00:24:43.871 --> 00:24:46.540
picture. I'm like, Oh my God, like I'm so supportive. And like,

480
00:24:46.541 --> 00:24:48.730
they change their profile picture. They do the blackout Tuesday.

481
00:24:48.731 --> 00:24:50.470
And then a week later it gets archived.

482
00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:54.880
When people go with like professional grade cameras and like bring a hair and

483
00:24:54.881 --> 00:24:57.820
makeup team to like sit there and like pose the middle of the street.

484
00:24:57.821 --> 00:25:00.850
Like it's less of the movement and more of the social media.

485
00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:01.601
<v 2>And yeah.</v>

486
00:25:01.601 --> 00:25:04.120
And I think that's also a perspective thing because I think there was maybe one

487
00:25:04.121 --> 00:25:07.300
or two major influencers who were dumb enough to take a production team out

488
00:25:07.301 --> 00:25:08.170
there to take a picture.

489
00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:11.860
And I think that was for people like you guys were anti-social media focused,

490
00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.600
be like, wow, let's see. Look at all these influencers.

491
00:25:13.601 --> 00:25:15.580
It's the whole avatar community is just like them.

492
00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.970
And I was in New York for a couple of days and I was in like Washington square

493
00:25:18.971 --> 00:25:20.560
or something. They were passing out flyers. They're like, Hey,

494
00:25:20.561 --> 00:25:22.630
share this on your Snapchat. If you know anyone in New York. And I,

495
00:25:22.631 --> 00:25:25.240
wasn't only in New York for like two days, but I posted it and I got like,

496
00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:27.670
I don't know, like 40,000 people on Snapchat to watch it and be,

497
00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:29.380
and if they were in New York, they could go by.

498
00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:32.290
<v 0>And he's like, performative parts. I'm not talking only influencers. Like, yes,</v>

499
00:25:32.291 --> 00:25:33.130
that is a big part.

500
00:25:33.131 --> 00:25:36.820
And it is very troublesome when influencers do like kind of go out and like pose

501
00:25:36.821 --> 00:25:39.220
for like the picture rather than, than for the protest.

502
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:43.180
But when people are kind of seeing like, Oh, this is trendy.

503
00:25:43.181 --> 00:25:46.030
And when people have that desire to like go viral,

504
00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:47.650
they'll go out and they'll do it.

505
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:52.690
<v 3>Here's like a scenario. What if I'm me, Alex? I mean, Alex, Alex and I,</v>

506
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:57.400
we all just teamed up. We did like a charity stream and then donated to,

507
00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:00.280
let's say, let's, let's just throw back to like early 2020,

508
00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:04.750
where there was like fires wouldn't California or Australia

509
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:06.790
thrive from us donating.

510
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.040
<v 2>I do agree that, um,</v>

511
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:12.820
social media does like promote awareness and it helps change indefinitely in our

512
00:26:12.821 --> 00:26:15.910
societies. Everyone's on social media. So if they see this and it gets spread,

513
00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:17.350
it's going to make change. Yeah.

514
00:26:17.351 --> 00:26:20.200
And that's kind of why I made like the logoff movement is because I saw that

515
00:26:20.201 --> 00:26:23.320
there was this multifaceted nature about social media and I at least just wanted

516
00:26:23.321 --> 00:26:24.940
to discuss it with teens and to be like,

517
00:26:24.941 --> 00:26:27.970
let's figure out how to exist in a healthier way. And, um,

518
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.310
even though social media, we can talk about the good and bad all day.

519
00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.350
It's just nice to be in one space and have one column.

520
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.570
<v 0>I mean, yeah. Technically social media did bring us here.</v>

521
00:26:34.571 --> 00:26:35.404
So I guess that's like a thing.

522
00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.660
<v 5>Hey, we don't have to talk about that.</v>

523
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.370
<v 2>Hi, everyone Bashir very happy new year and hope you enjoy this episode.</v>

524
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.220
I personally struggled a lot with my social media usage.

525
00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:53.640
So recently I bought an alarm clock so that the phone is not the first thing I

526
00:26:53.641 --> 00:26:56.280
look at in the morning. And I'm not tempted to go on social media.

527
00:26:56.370 --> 00:27:00.300
If you have any suggestions as to how you control your social media usage,

528
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:03.180
feel free to leave in the comment section below. And thanks for watching.
