00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.730
<v 1>I think you've got to watch this video because you watched the first spot and</v>

2
00:00:10.731 --> 00:00:13.070
you said you would tell, yeah, I can't help,

3
00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:16.550
but notice that your reactions to our videos get way more views.

4
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.200
So it's only fair that Jubilee media collaborates with beauty buyer,

5
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.120
maybe the audience can suggest some concepts in the comment section below for

6
00:00:26.121 --> 00:00:27.530
now. Enjoy the episode.

7
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.130
<v 2>I'll take it off. Yeah, there we go.</v>

8
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.480
Okay. All right. I think I'm good here.

9
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.390
You want to like start with introductions or something? Sure. Yeah. I mean,

10
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.320
can do that. Jeremy is my name, fun fact. He used to live in Texas. Uh,

11
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.243
but I didn't like it.

12
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.230
I'm Jorge pursuing a degree in kinesiology. I'm Anthony.

13
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.070
I made like YouTube videos. I workout stuff like that. Uh, I'm Sam,

14
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.690
I'm studying astrophysics and I'm an air force cadet. I'm Roy.

15
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.370
I'm a recent college graduate studying political science or shoot,

16
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.340
I guess. First of all, right off the bat. I don't know about you guys,

17
00:01:34.341 --> 00:01:36.110
but this guy looks like a young VIN diesel.

18
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.490
And have you guys seen his eyes? Yeah. Look at it.

19
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.570
Cause you got blue eyes. I like his eyes. Oh, you got a shiny,

20
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.570
he throws a good shirt. Make my way over here then.

21
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.843
<v 1>Okay.</v>

22
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.150
<v 0>I get a lot of compliments. And even though I don't really take compliments,</v>

23
00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:04.820
well, I guess there's been enough evidence to where I know.

24
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.590
<v 2>That people find me attractive.</v>

25
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.370
I feel like what we should do is just say what we think we are. Okay.

26
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.980
You don't get to say three feet. Yeah. Can we double up?

27
00:02:15.981 --> 00:02:20.240
I think three, I would personally put myself a four or five.

28
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.980
Yeah. I'd say four or five.

29
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.580
I think you guys should do get out and just say why you're at three.

30
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.640
I feel like I'm tall enough. Fair enough. Come the shorter. Does it go real

31
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.470
quick? You put a lot of work into yourself.

32
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.410
I thought he was gonna be number one, to be honest. So for me,

33
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:38.570
he at least has to be a three or a two. Hey,

34
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.350
I don't want to be like rude or blunt, but he kinda looks like a frat boy.

35
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.490
So I think he should be like a three kind of put a word in for myself that I'm

36
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.470
not a bad boy. I feel like we should switch. Like we should switch. I mean,

37
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.870
that's why I disagree. I think you're up there personally.

38
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.920
I'm content with being for four or five. I stick with five.

39
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.100
You're a pretty good looking. I say you're.

40
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.180
<v 3>Too pretty cute too. Roy. I think I'm a pretty attractive person overall,</v>

41
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.600
but seeing them and learning more about their personalities,

42
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:11.230
I wasn't going to argue that they're least attractive than me.

43
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.000
<v 1>I probably feel that you should rank higher.</v>

44
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.100
<v 2>Yeah. I feel like it should be. I don't know if the cameras can pick it up,</v>

45
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.930
but I woke up with blemishes today. I got a crooked nose.

46
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.140
I broke it a few years ago. Man. I've always had problems with my image.

47
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.560
Especially when I was younger, like around middle school, I got like horrible,

48
00:03:28.561 --> 00:03:31.410
horrible acne, you know, I'm left with like the scars and stuff.

49
00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:34.050
So that always like, really like kind of hurt my confidence. Yeah.

50
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.710
That seems like a big deal to you. But none of us, like you gotta be too dumb.

51
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.340
I just, because you're bigger. Like you can't even tell him, man.

52
00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.660
[inaudible] I'll take a three for you.

53
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.410
[inaudible] I would say you two, three, four, five bucks. He's too.

54
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.360
I don't know. Maybe I have a thing for white boys for, from my opinion.

55
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.900
And from my experience, he would be like higher on the ranking.

56
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.340
I think he's number two. We've saved you on two,

57
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.050
three against one he's two. Okay. Yeah. It's your prescription.

58
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.850
I mean, just look at this guy is dripped out. He puts some words.

59
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.840
You can get the beanie and he's got, we forgot about the jeans. Oh yeah.

60
00:04:36.841 --> 00:04:40.770
That's like plus points. He's still going to have more like more appearance.

61
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.220
Yeah. I wish I was a little bit bigger. Little bit stronger. Okay.

62
00:04:44.221 --> 00:04:46.770
So where am I? I think it's basically just them switch.

63
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.670
Where would you put me were an average right here at school.

64
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.310
I still think the wrong and I should be like here that's because you're humble.

65
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.940
We noticed once he took the jacket off and moved up a couple of spots.

66
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.760
I don't want to take it out. It's peer pressure to take off the jacket.

67
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.800
I like this though. I think this is cool. Well, dang.

68
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.610
<v 1>When I saw, when the guys were ranking each other,</v>

69
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.440
it's like a first impression type of thing.

70
00:05:34.441 --> 00:05:39.390
So basing off how you look and the conversation that we heard for a little

71
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.720
time out, I need to say they booties.

72
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:46.140
<v 2>Nothing.</v>

73
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:51.000
<v 1>Nothing, nothing. We need to get the 10 minute, little sweetheart. That is,</v>

74
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.250
that is wrong right now. I feel like he,

75
00:05:54.251 --> 00:05:58.220
he would give you flowers by far. If I was sick.

76
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.630
<v 4>I'd call him to take care of it. He says it like, Oh, Roy's a sweetheart. Oh,</v>

77
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:05.000
I love him. I wanted him to talk more.

78
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:08.800
I felt like all the boys talked over porn. Roy. Honestly, I love a little baby,

79
00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:12.100
Roy. He just kind of shoved to the back of the line every single time.

80
00:06:12.101 --> 00:06:16.040
And I was like this poor kid just for me. And it is a general whole, I was like,

81
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.650
well, my wanting to go hang out with right now.

82
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.590
Like if we were done after this and we went to, I'd be like, go grab coffee.

83
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.320
My number one would be spill the tea killer.

84
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.160
He looks like a bootleg. Michael B. Jordan.

85
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.240
So he will go first. Michael B. Jordan

86
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.800
[inaudible] or he has a nice haircut.

87
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.610
I guess I felt like I had a very friendly vibe from him,

88
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.770
just his like eyes and his smile. I thought Sam was the most attractive to me.

89
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.780
He wasn't striving to be number one. He was just like, place me where I am.

90
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.800
And I'll take that. I feel like he's friends with his mom and I did that. Yeah.

91
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.730
But I feel like also my like cheat on you. No,

92
00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.520
I'm just trying to think of something drastic here.

93
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.940
I don't know. I feel like he probably has a bad temper or something.

94
00:07:06.941 --> 00:07:10.990
He punches drywall when he gets angry. Caitlin gave her one. Who's your two,

95
00:07:10.991 --> 00:07:15.670
three, four. It was one, two, three, four five

96
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.290
one two, three, four, five. Ooh.

97
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:31.000
[inaudible] newsletter blue. Um, two,

98
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:37.090
three, four, five. Just because I'm very big on height. I would go one,

99
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.870
two, three,

100
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.510
sorry, immediately.

101
00:07:46.511 --> 00:07:49.720
I liked the guy in the green shirt who was shorter made eye contact.

102
00:07:49.721 --> 00:07:51.040
And I was like, okay, cool. Like,

103
00:07:51.041 --> 00:07:55.780
I think that's attractive is like connection one, two, three, four,

104
00:07:55.781 --> 00:07:58.630
five. Yay. Okay. I mean,

105
00:07:58.631 --> 00:08:02.590
I feel like I like a guy who is not so skinny just because I like, you know,

106
00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:07.210
protect you. I don't want to break them.

107
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.830
I really like his eyes. Okay. He's for sure one. Yeah.

108
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:20.620
Yeah. I think yeah. Or two or three. See, I think our hand

109
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.620
Jorge, Jorge. How dare you? I really adorable.

110
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:31.780
I don't really like anybody's outfit today. I understand.

111
00:08:31.781 --> 00:08:35.800
We're all comfortable. I dunno. I think dressing is important. Yeah.

112
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:40.090
That's fair. Can't make me picture them naked. That's weird. Do it.

113
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:46.300
Sure. We go and suck it and then everyone would scooch as everyone. Let's see.

114
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:51.070
Yeah, let's do it. Okay. Right. Yeah.

115
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.870
Yeah.

116
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.310
I would just like to say what a little angel.

117
00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.970
<v 1>Angel get somewhere. Not</v>

118
00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:03.330
little wings protective.

119
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:07.010
<v 3>I care more about what the girls thought than the guys,</v>

120
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.570
but that's just my own.

121
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.960
<v 1>Wait, so can we just move up because I, he can't be there.</v>

122
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.920
You little angle for personnel. Yeah. White shirt and white screen.

123
00:09:18.921 --> 00:09:23.480
I would switch, like you heard the ladies.

124
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.780
I kind of feel like maybe they should switch. Yeah.

125
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.300
I am a hundred percent. Okay. With this lineup,

126
00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.950
I feel like I'm walking with this.

127
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:52.730
<v 4>I felt like we did a pretty fair job. Most of the us came to a consensus on it.</v>

128
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.550
It did definitely feel a little degrading and a little uncomfortable.

129
00:09:55.551 --> 00:09:57.410
Don't get me wrong. I don't want to be mean,

130
00:09:57.411 --> 00:09:59.420
but I didn't find any of them attractive.

131
00:09:59.421 --> 00:10:03.530
So it was kind of a lot harder than I anticipated outside of this.

132
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.740
I wouldn't not have looked at any of the guys.

133
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.170
I will walk past each one of them,

134
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:13.490
but being in the same room and seeing this type of

135
00:10:13.491 --> 00:10:17.570
personalities that they have, these are some nice guys to be friends with.

136
00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.190
<v 1>Well, we are real different. Real,</v>

137
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:26.990
mostly goes where a more personality base, which is good. But I mean,

138
00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:28.610
it's still, you can't know.

139
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.190
<v 2>I thought I was going to be lower.</v>

140
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.600
I stayed two throughout the second two rounds. So I'm content with yeah.

141
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.710
<v 4>To track. There is a guy who is attractive, but thinks he's not,</v>

142
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:41.720
someone's looking at, at my confidence. They were like,

143
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.910
maybe this person isn't nice. Or maybe this person,

144
00:10:43.911 --> 00:10:45.300
I wouldn't take him home with my family.

145
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:49.640
People make all those assumptions before they even know anything about you.

146
00:10:49.641 --> 00:10:52.820
So it's cool to see what people see outside of you.

147
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:53.630
<v 3>Your point of view,</v>

148
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:57.980
being judged by other people based off like a minute is kind of like,

149
00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.390
give me like a little bit of anxiety to think that maybe we do that

150
00:11:02.391 --> 00:11:04.130
subconsciously towards other people.

151
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.450
<v 2>Growing up Mexican and being Latino attractiveness is set around this like image</v>

152
00:11:08.451 --> 00:11:13.070
of being like, just really like macho, muscular, you know, Bronx,

153
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.760
chiseled man with like facial hair and stuff like that.

154
00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:21.190
I don't typically see myself or like associate myself with that. So I don't,

155
00:11:21.191 --> 00:11:22.490
I don't think I'm all that adjective.

156
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:27.140
I do not know what the women are looking for because apparently I have some of

157
00:11:27.141 --> 00:11:29.570
it and I hope I figured out what that is.
