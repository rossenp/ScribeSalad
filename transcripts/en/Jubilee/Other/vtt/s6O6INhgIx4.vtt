1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.133
<v 0>Uh, dreaming,</v>

2
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.173
dreaming.

3
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.370
We brought together eight professional models. I am a model.

4
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.990
<v 1>I'm a model. I'm a model. I am a professional fashion.</v>

5
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.700
<v 2>Model. I am a professional model.</v>

6
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.230
<v 0>I'm a professional model.</v>

7
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.500
I'm a model. One is a liar.

8
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.100
If the group discovers who the liar is, they'll win a cash prize.

9
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.980
If the liar survives, they win the cash prize.

10
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.273
Odd man out.

11
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.410
<v 2>My current game plan is to kind of see people that might get confused by certain</v>

12
00:00:54.411 --> 00:00:56.030
terms that average people.

13
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.863
<v 0>Just wouldn't know.</v>

14
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.710
<v 1>Show themselves pretty easily. Everything behind you about being a model.</v>

15
00:01:00.711 --> 00:01:01.850
It's not just posing. Okay.

16
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.360
<v 2>Some things you might think you know from the outside,</v>

17
00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:08.930
but then once you actually work as a model, it's all very different.

18
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.250
<v 1>It could be the more Molly Rams with them. All the twins look moly.</v>

19
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.410
<v 3>It's for Melissa and I and all of these it's home.</v>

20
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.530
I am America's next top model.

21
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.830
<v 0>Hi everyone.</v>

22
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.280
<v 2>So I'm asking where, where is everybody based in Toronto?</v>

23
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.230
I'm based in Orlando. Orlando is like,

24
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.480
I don't know about that,

25
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.830
but I'm not sure I'm from the Netherlands.

26
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.400
What is the number one thing you never want to wear?

27
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.560
How did you guys

28
00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.040
get scouted signed?

29
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.690
I got scouted

30
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.150
working freedoms. Should I say that though?

31
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.810
My friend got me into modeling. Hmm. Okay.

32
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.670
That's got it from a college fashion show.

33
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.210
<v 1>I'm in D pendant. I am not signed,</v>

34
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.320
but book a lot. So.

35
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.320
<v 2>You do everything yourself or another Instagram or?</v>

36
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.250
<v 1>Oh, it's a lot of Instagram. Instagram not signed,</v>

37
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.830
but George books, everything by himself this year. That's so sad.

38
00:02:35.831 --> 00:02:40.100
I got scouted from Instagram. Okay. Yolanda. Absolutely not. You are the mole.

39
00:02:40.101 --> 00:02:43.190
So yours is George George. And say how to, no, I don't want to target.

40
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.360
You don't want to target here, right?

41
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.110
<v 2>All over in New York, but he's from the East coast. What do you mean?</v>

42
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.520
<v 3>We're in New York. All right.</v>

43
00:02:49.521 --> 00:02:53.960
I want to know what do you never

44
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.730
show up to eight shoot. Molly.

45
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.070
What do you never.

46
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.530
<v 2>Show too? She didn't. Why is she asking the same question over and over?</v>

47
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.940
What's your favorite type of monument?

48
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.590
<v 1>Genesis says I'm independent, but I've been signed previously.</v>

49
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.370
<v 2>Oh, 10, nine, eight. No, no Prince lifestyle. No.</v>

50
00:03:17.371 --> 00:03:22.080
One's going to answer my position. It's tight. Ooh. Ooh.

51
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.840
<v 1>This is stressful. My heart is beating.</v>

52
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.800
I don't want to vote anybody out on chat. I'm scared. What if they vote we way?

53
00:03:28.801 --> 00:03:31.200
Because they think I like no too much.

54
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.480
<v 2>George said he books, everything himself.</v>

55
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.630
He probably doesn't know how scouting works and stuff like that.

56
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.600
<v 1>I'm definitely voting for Yolanda. Just because of her Instagram comment.</v>

57
00:03:42.601 --> 00:03:44.850
She said she got scouted from Instagram,

58
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.100
which is definitely a thing.

59
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.600
I wasn't got it through Instagram. Yeah.

60
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.790
<v 2>I'm voting out George this round because he mentioned something about how agents</v>

61
00:03:56.791 --> 00:04:00.660
should get you gigs. Yes. Unless you're not signed like myself.

62
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.070
He sounds very researched.

63
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.990
<v 1>I think I'm going to vote for</v>

64
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.510
Yolanda said she was based in Orlando. I don't know anybody.

65
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.040
Who's based in Orlando and it's working professionally. It's very bad.

66
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.460
That doesn't mean she's not a model. It's definitely Molly or George, I think.

67
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.380
Oh, you want George? Okay. I'm okay. If anything, George,

68
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.880
George is not sorry. That's okay, Molly. We're doing Molly.

69
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.850
<v 2>What are you looking at? I swear if I get bored.</v>

70
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.110
<v 3>Round one, Melissa is going to lose it.</v>

71
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.640
The first person voted out is.

72
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.533
<v 2>George.</v>

73
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.010
<v 1>The reason why I feel like I got voted off was because I said I was independent.</v>

74
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.970
Now being independent, especially in this day and age is kind of a good thing.

75
00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.000
One, your agency doesn't take 10 to 20% of your check.

76
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.410
You get all of that lends itself into honey. If you want to become successful,

77
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.840
you find the work yourself, honestly,

78
00:05:06.841 --> 00:05:10.020
kind of iconic to get eliminated first because you're too pretty.

79
00:05:10.021 --> 00:05:13.020
Or because you like are killing it already.

80
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.080
<v 2>The prize challenge. Okay.</v>

81
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.540
<v 3>10 Minutes to take a photo of yourself. Choose your backdrop,</v>

82
00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:24.630
your lighting, work your angles. How you please, if you want to edit it.

83
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.790
<v 1>Work your angles. This is going to be fun. Ready? Set. Go.</v>

84
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.183
<v 2>Where.</v>

85
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.210
<v 1>We're going to set up the prompts here. Set it up.</v>

86
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.310
That takes away all the iPads until I kind of reflect under your face.

87
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.410
Are you sure of the plants? Yeah. Yeah. Just go on. Go on together. Hold on,

88
00:05:46.411 --> 00:05:47.460
hold on. Hold on. Don't laugh.

89
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.730
<v 2>Outside. It's cloudy. That's such good lighting. Okay.</v>

90
00:05:50.731 --> 00:05:55.320
It's raining outside or not trying to get struck by lightning. Okay.

91
00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:58.010
We're going inside. Inside. Who? Doesn't love a good.

92
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.480
<v 1>Set with an animal who I guess, Oh no. Wait, go.</v>

93
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.470
<v 0>Find a good area to take the selfie. And this would look good</v>

94
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.923
in Priscilla.

95
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.480
<v 1>Quickly, quickly edit the light really quickly.</v>

96
00:06:22.481 --> 00:06:25.810
And the high contrast high contrast. Yes. Touch the skin. Touch all the skin.

97
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.420
Go, go, go, go.

98
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.110
<v 0>Go Showtime. I like those words.</v>

99
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.430
<v 2>Oh, she looks great. I think I did.</v>

100
00:06:39.431 --> 00:06:44.230
Okay with that challenge. I think I got my ankles. Oh my goodness.

101
00:06:44.231 --> 00:06:45.064
She's a model.

102
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.310
<v 0>Oh wow. Oh wow.</v>

103
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.500
That's me and my baby. Her.

104
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.930
<v 2>Hair is huge and beautiful.</v>

105
00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:01.600
<v 0>Um, I always,</v>

106
00:07:01.601 --> 00:07:02.650
when Darlene.

107
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.480
<v 2>[Inaudible] let's give me move me.</v>

108
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.213
<v 0>Uh, please.</v>

109
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:16.413
<v 2>I bet.</v>

110
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.680
She's really looking into that camera with those eyes.

111
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:27.340
She got the props to, I attend no problem. My only problem with this wig girl.

112
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.400
<v 0>Oh, Hey on.</v>

113
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:36.040
<v 2>Don't tell Yolanda she's so gorgeous. So pretty the pose. Okay. Yeah.</v>

114
00:07:36.041 --> 00:07:39.100
I think she's a model. I was trying to go outside and it started to rain.

115
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.960
<v 1>But it's about the same poses. They like,</v>

116
00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:45.900
let me look at Genesis and look at like everyone did

117
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.850
this. I mean, nothing's, it's a nice pose.

118
00:07:48.851 --> 00:07:50.170
I mean it does between you and a lot of stuff.

119
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.350
<v 0>It's not cold enough. It's too hot. It's not just my sweater anymore.</v>

120
00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:00.580
<v 2>Josh. [inaudible] Josh.</v>

121
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:05.530
Very pretty face. Pretty hard eyes. His skin is like glowy.

122
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:06.423
Oh wow.

123
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:11.560
<v 0>This is a lot. You're real cute fellow. But you're not a model.</v>

124
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.600
Certainly your angles. Joshua.

125
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.890
<v 2>Certainly. No, your ankles. Joshua. Why should call him Joshua?</v>

126
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.120
His name is Joshua here. What would you do if you says, wait.

127
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.070
Oh, what's y'all doing,

128
00:08:27.071 --> 00:08:29.170
I didn't expect it to look like that. They definitely.

129
00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.690
<v 0>I don't even know how to respond to that. Wow.</v>

130
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.970
<v 2>Wow. So photogenic. Wow. This is terrible.</v>

131
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.580
We're not worried. We're not worthy. We're not worthy.

132
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:44.050
<v 0>Hire them. Hire them right now.</v>

133
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:49.720
Oh, like two suspects, Convenia. And I'm still on you Josh.

134
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.650
I'm sorry, Josh. She beautiful. He took it like out on his front porch.

135
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.010
I could be totally wrong. Look at me. I look like.

136
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.410
<v 2>A clown. They took it for my streamline high angle.</v>

137
00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:01.850
<v 1>You're given 10 minutes. I don't expect an overhead selfie.</v>

138
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.030
<v 2>Canadia. She had more of a goofy picture. It was funny,</v>

139
00:09:05.031 --> 00:09:07.820
but like the angles look kind of odd and off to me.

140
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.500
<v 1>Gosh, I'm a little suspicious of a brand name on his chest.</v>

141
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:16.100
And that's usually as a model. It's a big no-no.

142
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.990
<v 4>I'm going to go from Molly. You killed it. I wasn't feeling those like model,</v>

143
00:09:20.991 --> 00:09:22.160
model buyers. You know what I'm saying?

144
00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:26.960
I probably have the most basic selfie out of all of them. So we're going to see.

145
00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.510
<v 2>The next person eliminated is,</v>

146
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.810
uh, she really cute.

147
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.570
She hitting on Josh.

148
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.610
<v 4>Honestly. I don't even feel bad about it.</v>

149
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:48.470
Everybody in this entire chat looks amazing and they

150
00:09:48.471 --> 00:09:51.050
kill it at Molly better than I ever, ever.

151
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:54.913
<v 2>Hey guys,</v>

152
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:00.800
now it's really starting.

153
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:05.930
Can you guys hear the clown on the left and we can hear you. Good.

154
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.850
Hear you. Okay, cool. Yeah. So I guess we should start asking questions.

155
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:11.773
What are your rates?

156
00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.260
<v 1>Um, or we have an agency fee. It depends on the game. You know,</v>

157
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:18.290
how long is the media campaign? How long does it go and buy in?

158
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.580
It depends if the agency booked me my job or if I booked it myself and it

159
00:10:22.581 --> 00:10:26.420
definitely depends. Is it half a day? Is it like an e-com day of 12,

160
00:10:26.421 --> 00:10:28.040
10 or 12 hours? It's going to.

161
00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:29.960
<v 2>For me it differs too.</v>

162
00:10:29.961 --> 00:10:33.020
Just cause like I'm also dance talent and stuff like that.

163
00:10:33.021 --> 00:10:35.240
Sometimes they need like background dancers.

164
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.820
Sometimes it's just like a short film.

165
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:41.000
I usually get all the details first and then I'll send them like a quote.

166
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:42.950
And then also like sometimes I'll have a flat rate.

167
00:10:42.951 --> 00:10:46.130
Now when I'm working with the big names, then I'll get paid.

168
00:10:46.131 --> 00:10:50.450
But I usually just do, uh, art trades for now.

169
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:54.800
<v 1>You guys own models or do also things outside of modeling, no model job.</v>

170
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.230
Me personally is not sustainable. You have a part-time job.

171
00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:01.010
So you're working two jobs to I'm sure that if you want to go to the next game,

172
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.420
you have to get someone to cover for your shift.

173
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:08.120
<v 2>Motto. I'm a painter, I'm a performance artist and I am way too much</v>

174
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.120
here. It is just the right amount since I also work at planet smoothie.

175
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:19.010
So if you guys ever need a smoothie, I'm an artist. I do singing.

176
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.320
I play guitar. I play piano singing.

177
00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:27.530
So I model a sing dance teach act basically like everything,

178
00:11:27.531 --> 00:11:30.380
performing arts. Um, and then I also paint. So I love doing that.

179
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:31.730
And I do makeup as well.

180
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:34.820
<v 1>I'm a model and actor and I do styling too.</v>

181
00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:40.010
<v 2>I'm a model. Believe me, is this convincing it?</v>

182
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:43.220
Um, they all seem so genuine,

183
00:11:43.221 --> 00:11:46.460
but I am going to kind of go towards Molly.

184
00:11:46.461 --> 00:11:49.490
Maybe she just seems like old, too much.

185
00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.880
<v 1>It sounded like she was maybe more into art and production.</v>

186
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.400
I think Molly's definitely knows her stuff. I think it's gender system.

187
00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.860
Not a rate question. It doesn't matter what rate you get it,

188
00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:02.470
but it depends on the budget. You have to ask the company or campaign.

189
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.860
So ask the person to be raised. Very influenced your life.

190
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.180
<v 2>Okay. I'm going to vote for Molly on sorry. Draw that gamer headset.</v>

191
00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:12.400
And then also she was trying really hard to convince us though.

192
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:18.180
<v 3>Rhonda, any of my cancels of winning by I think it's leg</v>

193
00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:22.200
because she has led today. That's great. But that picture,

194
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.040
I hope they remember before this building.

195
00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.330
I am with child.

196
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:34.680
So the next person eliminated for round three

197
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.010
is folly.

198
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.770
<v 2>Okay. It was Molly. Molly got eliminated.</v>

199
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.593
<v 3>Real.</v>

200
00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:01.320
I'm done. I'm done killing me.

201
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:04.680
[inaudible].

202
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.990
<v 1>For everyone. How do you guys prepare for a shoot?</v>

203
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:10.860
<v 2>You're mentally as far as like how I would dress,</v>

204
00:13:10.861 --> 00:13:13.410
like for a shoe and stuff like that, just something really comfortable.

205
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.620
Cause I know I'm going to be waiting all day. I bring like a magazine, no oils,

206
00:13:16.621 --> 00:13:20.280
no like sensitive stuff. I want to get on the clothing mentally. I meditate,

207
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:24.530
pray before and I listen to good music and you know, what about y'all?

208
00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:28.320
I definitely always have like three pairs of fluffy socks, like in my bag.

209
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:31.140
Cause like, sometimes like it's so cold,

210
00:13:31.141 --> 00:13:34.410
but usually like a week before I kind of just like distress.

211
00:13:34.411 --> 00:13:38.640
So for me that means like dancing or like doing something that I really love

212
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.560
eating like really clean drinking,

213
00:13:40.561 --> 00:13:43.350
nothing but water trying not to like blow or anything like that.

214
00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.520
<v 1>For me, it's pretty similar.</v>

215
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:49.230
I also just try to be in a good mood because being social with like a stylist or

216
00:13:49.231 --> 00:13:52.800
being social with the makeup artists helps me as well.

217
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:56.700
I always like shave and my hair. That's like the biggest deal.

218
00:13:56.701 --> 00:13:59.220
So if I know I have a shoot the day after tomorrow,

219
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.130
I'm going to like wash my hair to two days before.

220
00:14:02.131 --> 00:14:04.800
And then the second day I'm always tries it for us. I mean,

221
00:14:04.801 --> 00:14:06.540
we prepare a lot too. I mean, for the whole beak,

222
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:10.350
the minute you have like that kind of, you know, like just something messed you,

223
00:14:10.351 --> 00:14:13.890
just like why like a pimple, you have to like study the mood boards so much.

224
00:14:13.891 --> 00:14:16.350
And we do like face mask before like the narrow issue.

225
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:20.730
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

226
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:25.140
<v 2>This round. Um, what's a lot harder. I'm not really suspicious of anyone,</v>

227
00:14:25.141 --> 00:14:28.470
but I'm going to have to go with, um, Genesis.

228
00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:31.560
I feel like I trust the twins the most they're so photogenic,

229
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:33.600
even in the zoom call, like they look so good.

230
00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:38.340
<v 1>Oh my God. It's just nerve wracking to know that someone could do them all.</v>

231
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.110
I think we still agree with Genesis.

232
00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.200
She asked the question like physically or mentally. It's like, well

233
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:50.370
[inaudible], it's not a good reasoning, but so maybe she's more of a tensor.

234
00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:52.340
I Genesis.

235
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:57.320
<v 2>Like her lighting is perfect. Um, maybe not talking about it,</v>

236
00:14:57.321 --> 00:15:00.260
maybe she's a makeup artist. I feel like the target might be on me.

237
00:15:00.261 --> 00:15:03.740
So I'm going to try to throw my boat at Yolanda.

238
00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:08.470
<v 3>The results of round four are tie.</v>

239
00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:12.100
The tie is between Yolanda and Genesis.

240
00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:13.330
<v 2>The ties between.</v>

241
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:19.900
<v 3>Then do next resolve that tie is we're going to have a</v>

242
00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.610
32nd pose off.

243
00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.800
<v 2>Okay. Yeah, this is all I caught. I call it, I call it.</v>

244
00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:38.260
Okay. Yeah.

245
00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:40.840
Yeah. Wow.

246
00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.770
She knows it. She knows it. And she Oh

247
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.150
yes. Oh yes.

248
00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:59.920
Wow. Okay. Oh yeah.

249
00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.530
She's a model. Oh my goodness. Ooh,

250
00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:11.710
fantastic. You can tell that the side profile.

251
00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.750
There's a thing. Give us a second.

252
00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:20.223
Yeah.

253
00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:28.690
<v 3>So we did a revolt after our wonderful ladies were willing to do a pose off.</v>

254
00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.360
Uh, we are hide again.

255
00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:36.190
<v 2>We're at another tie. Oh my gosh, guys, tired again.</v>

256
00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.880
<v 3>You have two options. We can end the game here.</v>

257
00:16:39.881 --> 00:16:44.800
If you give me a thumbs down or we can go into another round with

258
00:16:44.801 --> 00:16:48.730
everyone. If you give me a thumbs up, but again, majority rules.

259
00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.010
<v 2>I want to end the game. I think they're all good.</v>

260
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.130
Everybody here is a model.

261
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.590
I think we got them all out.

262
00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:02.280
I think it's believable at this point. They're scared.

263
00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:08.200
<v 3>All right. We have a unanimous vote down. So we're stopping the game.</v>

264
00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:12.850
So if the color is green,

265
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:17.200
our remaining players won. If the color is red,

266
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.430
our remaining players lost. Ready. Three,

267
00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.830
two, one.

268
00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:30.250
<v 2>It was probably Quincy and Willie.</v>

269
00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:35.980
It was probably Quincy and Willie.

270
00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:39.400
Who was it that I really think you were right? I think we were right.

271
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:41.800
Who did this to me?

272
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:49.240
I want to talk to you. I'm now I'm upset.

273
00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.900
<v 3>I'm going to ask them all to raise their hand.</v>

274
00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:08.720
[inaudible] I'm highly offended. So that's all I have. I'm so sorry, Molly.

275
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:14.510
<v 2>Okay. I'm so sorry. I like, I hate lying to people. This is hard.</v>

276
00:18:14.511 --> 00:18:17.000
I tried to sign to like a modeling agency,

277
00:18:17.001 --> 00:18:18.950
but they turned out to be like a scam and stuff.

278
00:18:18.951 --> 00:18:20.480
So I just never tried after that.

279
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:24.290
All of my knowledge is actually all from my friend. Shauni she's a great model.

280
00:18:24.291 --> 00:18:27.780
I love her. But yeah, none of that is mine whatsoever.

281
00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:31.730
<v 3>You got us girl. The first person I voted for was Yolanda.</v>

282
00:18:31.731 --> 00:18:35.000
So therefore who really won here, the first person out.

283
00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:38.300
Now we can end it.

284
00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:40.850
<v 2>Well, you'd go.</v>

285
00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.540
A professional model to me is someone who works hard like,

286
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:47.510
Oh my goodness model is just always changing,

287
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.540
evolving in so many different types of modeling. As long as.

288
00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:53.810
<v 3>You know how to work, your angles and audience.</v>

289
00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:57.110
<v 0>Um, character.</v>

290
00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:00.350
<v 3>Isn't afraid to take chances.</v>

291
00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:04.100
<v 0>You would have to have a certain look or a certain size to be signed.</v>

292
00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:05.600
You don't have to be working day.

293
00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.990
<v 2>Day. I guess. You know, my posting is good enough.</v>

294
00:19:08.991 --> 00:19:13.700
So if anybody wants to hire me, come at me, baby,

295
00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:17.600
I'm ready. I learned to trust them

296
00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:25.280
Except that you can trust her.

297
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:35.870
<v 0>I gave you silence retired.</v>

298
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:38.803
I told you

299
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.350
[inaudible].
