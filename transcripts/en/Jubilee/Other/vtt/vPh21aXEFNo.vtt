00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.830
<v 0>I feel like society today,</v>

2
00:00:01.831 --> 00:00:05.520
especially millennials were addicted to feeling sensitive and offended.

3
00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:08.700
Like literally people's nipples get hard when they're freaking offended by

4
00:00:08.701 --> 00:00:09.534
something.

5
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.330
<v 1>With the election. Upon us,</v>

6
00:00:11.331 --> 00:00:14.990
millions of Americans are gearing up to cast their vote for the next president

7
00:00:14.991 --> 00:00:18.410
of the United States. While some people will be voting independent.

8
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.400
We want it to hear from Trump voters and biting voters about why they are voting

9
00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:24.590
for their candidate in spectrum.

10
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.250
We bring everyday people together for authentic discussions that represent

11
00:00:28.251 --> 00:00:29.420
what's happening. Now,

12
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.800
these discussions should not be anyone sole source forming opinions on important

13
00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:37.430
issues. Please do your own research, seek out experts,

14
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.240
push yourself outside your bubble and have empathy. Thanks for watching.

15
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.930
<v 0>Hello, my name is Rachel I'm from Dallas, Texas.</v>

16
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.910
I've been a conservative my whole life,

17
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.080
but my views have definitely evolved and I'm happy to be here. Hi, I'm Casey.

18
00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:55.550
I live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

19
00:00:55.551 --> 00:00:58.940
and I actually work in politics and I've watched very closely,

20
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.210
kind of the Republican party turned from republicanism to kind of Trump

21
00:01:02.211 --> 00:01:04.130
republicanism. And I'm excited to talk about that.

22
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.460
<v 2>Hi, my name is Noah. I'm a teenage conservative from the great state of Georgia.</v>

23
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.420
Uh, I've been a conservative for my whole life and I'm really looking forward to

24
00:01:11.421 --> 00:01:14.630
this discussion. My name is Malique I'm from Detroit, Michigan.

25
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.340
I just turned 23. I was always economical. Even when I was very little.

26
00:01:19.341 --> 00:01:21.290
Now I'm a medical student in the theater.

27
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.210
<v 0>Hi, my name is Amie when it comes to social issues and everything, I, uh,</v>

28
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.970
could be considered a little bit more liberal.

29
00:01:28.971 --> 00:01:33.140
I do support our president 100%, four more years was good.

30
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.820
So yeah.

31
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.090
<v 2>Hi, my name's Alicia. I'm 20 years old.</v>

32
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.560
My mom immigrated to America from Nicaragua as a political refugee.

33
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.940
And then my father's side of the family immigrated from Mexico and I am also

34
00:01:46.941 --> 00:01:50.030
eight months pregnant and I'm super excited to be a first time. Mom.

35
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.000
<v 1>Behavior can be offensive. Rachel,</v>

36
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.020
somewhat disagree. Casey agree.

37
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.920
Noah agree, army.

38
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.220
<v 0>Alicia, strongly agree. Agree.</v>

39
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.160
I think that Trump gets a lot of flack more than other presidents for

40
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.090
offending people because he is not politically correct.

41
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.470
The politically correct culture has been shoved down our throats.

42
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.480
And the reason why people like his rhetoric is because he doesn't put

43
00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:31.010
up with that toxic culture.

44
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.130
<v 2>The reason I said agree is because while he hasn't directly offended me,</v>

45
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.040
I do think some of the, some of his rhetoric can be offensive. I mean,

46
00:02:37.041 --> 00:02:40.550
I I'm sure stormy Daniels was pretty offended to be called Horseface even though

47
00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:43.700
it was Epic. When it comes to a lot of his policies, I tend to agree with him,

48
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.040
uh, what he, what he's done with the taxes. I think we can all agree. Well,

49
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.140
if we could just take his Twitter account away,

50
00:02:48.141 --> 00:02:49.820
sometimes I just limit what he says.

51
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.830
You're going to get a good writer in their first tweets.

52
00:02:51.831 --> 00:02:53.450
I think we'd be in a way better place in the country.

53
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.260
I actually enjoy president Trump's tweets. I have at least been set up.

54
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.070
I agree with me. I don't even factor.

55
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.670
<v 3>In the rhetoric, but when it comes to president Trump anymore,</v>

56
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.330
because of all the results that he's gotten and if that's how he has to behave

57
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:11.110
in order to achieve the results, I'm totally fine for it.

58
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:13.180
I see a fighter and that's what I like about him.

59
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.480
<v 0>The one time he offended me, I quickly found out that it was from fake news.</v>

60
00:03:18.481 --> 00:03:23.190
So that was in the beginning of the election when he was running in 2016. Um,

61
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.380
it was the disabled thing. Like the little girl,

62
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.270
that little thing that offended me,

63
00:03:27.271 --> 00:03:30.840
but that quickly dissipated when I found out that's what he does.

64
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.740
Everything else that I have heard him say from this point, um,

65
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.600
I haven't felt personally offended, but when I hear him say certain things,

66
00:03:39.601 --> 00:03:41.850
I'm like, I could hear the screeching. I could hear it.

67
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.670
Re you can just hear like the freaking people freaking out.

68
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:45.270
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

69
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.250
The one thing that I say kind of offended me that I kind of didn't like was when

70
00:03:50.251 --> 00:03:52.950
he, the Hollywood access tape grabbed him by the, you know,

71
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.040
I didn't really like that. But then, um,

72
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.400
I thought about it more about he wasn't running for president.

73
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.190
He was a Democrat at the time. Uh,

74
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.000
and this has nothing to do with who he is today. He was talking about groupies.

75
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.460
And to me, like when I asked, looked at the context and everything like, yeah,

76
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.000
now, now I know who he's talking about. He's not talking about, Oh, army.

77
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.440
I could just grab, no, you can't do that to be able to do that.

78
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.780
I'm going to hit you with a backhand over there.

79
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.740
Exactly what he's talking about. The women that are like, not just any woman,

80
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.540
he was particular women.

81
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.560
<v 0>And think of when he said that stuff to and access Hollywood, by that time,</v>

82
00:04:31.561 --> 00:04:34.320
Donald Trump was being talked about in rap videos.

83
00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:37.650
He was on comedy central during those rails, he was in Hollywood.

84
00:04:37.651 --> 00:04:40.800
We know who he was talking about. So when all these people,

85
00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:44.220
especially in the black community, when you dare you, the grab them by the foot.

86
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.490
<v 2>If he had been black and said it in a rap song</v>

87
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.130
[inaudible] Oh, wait, wait, wait, he's a Republican. Oh no, no, no. We disagree.

88
00:04:56.131 --> 00:04:56.964
We disagree.

89
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.030
<v 3>Yeah. I was only ever offended by Trump once.</v>

90
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.530
And this was whenever he said something about like Mexicans being like animals

91
00:05:04.531 --> 00:05:08.310
or like something like that. And so I was like, Oh my gosh, it's so offensive.

92
00:05:08.311 --> 00:05:11.070
Like, why would he say that? And then my stepdad was like,

93
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.170
did you read like everything that he said?

94
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.010
So I went back and he was talking about like the Ms. 13 gangs that were in

95
00:05:17.011 --> 00:05:18.960
Mexico and stuff. So I like,

96
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.580
kind of learned a lot about fake news and how a lot of people are like

97
00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:26.820
sensitive to his rhetoric and what he says.

98
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.460
<v 0>What do you think? I feel like society today,</v>

99
00:05:29.461 --> 00:05:33.150
especially millennials were addicted to feeling sensitive and offended.

100
00:05:33.151 --> 00:05:36.300
Like literally people's nipples get hard when they're freaking offended by

101
00:05:36.301 --> 00:05:36.840
something.

102
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.160
<v 2>I mean, I mean, I, I think I know why that is. It's because if I'm offended,</v>

103
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.440
if I'm a victim, I get more attention. It's like,

104
00:05:43.441 --> 00:05:46.290
there's a hierarchy of victimhood. Well, I'm black,

105
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.090
but you're black army and a woman. So that means you get more power.

106
00:05:51.091 --> 00:05:55.170
It's like in the lips, it's like the more victimized you are,

107
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.550
the more you should be heard, the more power you should be given. And to me,

108
00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:02.150
I think that's pretty sad. Systemic racism.

109
00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.270
<v 3>That's a problem in America,</v>

110
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.640
strongly disagree, somewhat disagree.

111
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.230
<v 0>Noah. I said, somewhat agree, somewhat agree.</v>

112
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.760
<v 3>I said, strongly disagree, fully.</v>

113
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.170
<v 2>Somewhat agree.</v>

114
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.840
Systemic implies that it's built into the DNA of our country.

115
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.130
And I just don't think that that was why this country was founded.

116
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.350
It wasn't founded to be a racist.

117
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.480
<v 3>Systemic is really that there's laws in place that</v>

118
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.490
prevent people of color from excelling. And while in the past,

119
00:06:42.491 --> 00:06:46.270
there definitely have been laws that were systemically racist.

120
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.110
There aren't any anymore. There's so many examples,

121
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.880
people of color that Excel in America, for example, like Barack Obama,

122
00:06:54.881 --> 00:06:56.680
he's like a black president.

123
00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.570
You also have like AOC who was a bartender. She's a person of color.

124
00:07:01.571 --> 00:07:04.900
And she literally just like came up and became like, you know,

125
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:05.980
house of representative.

126
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.050
<v 0>Can I ask everybody this real quick,</v>

127
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.030
Joe Biden's 94 crime bill that specifically targeted people of color.

128
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.320
You wouldn't consider that to be systematic.

129
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.110
Something that was put into place that is going to target the breakdown. One,

130
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.370
the break down of the fan black family. Sorry to be like a military,

131
00:07:21.371 --> 00:07:24.040
but there's some skid marks. America has some like total skin marks.

132
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.360
<v 3>Yeah. There has been like,</v>

133
00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:28.390
cause like I'm studying history and I'm taking an old South class.

134
00:07:28.391 --> 00:07:30.190
So we're just talking about slavery. Like,

135
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.250
so I'm not denying that there hasn't been systemic slavery before,

136
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:37.870
but I in 2020 today, like there's not systemic racism.

137
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:42.100
<v 0>In the nineties 94. That was the year I was born. That's no, not too long ago.</v>

138
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.840
And the residue, the effects that I had within two generations, um, is,

139
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.470
you know, it looked pretty structured to me. You know what I mean?

140
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.630
<v 2>Like what you had to say with, um, the 1994 crime bill,</v>

141
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.230
because that's exactly where I was going with it. That's why I somewhat agree.

142
00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:57.251
And the other policy,

143
00:07:57.251 --> 00:08:01.390
that thing is also really important would be school choice in the schools that

144
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:01.571
were,

145
00:08:01.571 --> 00:08:05.860
I was growing up the way they teach history and the way they teach the spirit,

146
00:08:05.861 --> 00:08:06.830
you know, that they were teaching.

147
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.850
<v 0>Well, I felt like in the classroom.</v>

148
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:14.470
<v 2>You are determined that you will fail. You cannot succeed.</v>

149
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.260
You will never make it. And to me personally,

150
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.740
whenever somebody told me I can't do something, I said, okay, watch.

151
00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.790
And then I went to medical school, but, uh, for a lot of other people,

152
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:26.680
they don't have what I have, you know?

153
00:08:26.681 --> 00:08:30.550
So I think it is systematic because it's mostly black people in these areas

154
00:08:30.551 --> 00:08:31.031
being caught,

155
00:08:31.031 --> 00:08:35.020
these things that keep them from even thinking that it's possible for them to

156
00:08:35.021 --> 00:08:38.170
achieve. So that's why I say systematic racism is a problem.

157
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.120
And it comes from the democratic side.

158
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:44.740
<v 3>I have to disagree. There's no law saying that you have to teach black children,</v>

159
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:48.730
that they can't make it in the world. The issue is really funding.

160
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.390
And I think people get distracted and tend to blame it on system,

161
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:56.400
on systemic racism. When it's not a, it's a poverty issue.

162
00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:00.060
<v 0>You don't think that systematically white kids are in poor districts as well.</v>

163
00:09:00.061 --> 00:09:04.530
And there are tons of districts around the nation who that are a majority white

164
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.740
and they're poor, but black people are typically, if we look at statistics,

165
00:09:07.741 --> 00:09:09.690
black people are in that lower income.

166
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.110
People of color are in that lower income bubble right there.

167
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.910
I feel like that's systematic. You know what I mean?

168
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.710
It's targeting a specific group.

169
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:21.660
There are tons of white kids in that bubble too. No, I didn't. I didn't. Yeah,

170
00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:25.320
I didn't dis I didn't, uh, disagree on that part. I definitely,

171
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.470
Brian gave a shout out to, you know, there are white kids in the trailer park.

172
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:33.680
<v 3>A lot of it has to do with like the culture or the way that the</v>

173
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:38.600
black like normal, typical black family is set up. The statistics say that, uh,

174
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:42.980
black people don't have like two family households and that has a lot to do.

175
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:47.510
Yeah. That has like a lot to do with like, Oh, the poverty rates there,

176
00:09:47.511 --> 00:09:51.770
like where they end up in school, they go to jail more often.

177
00:09:51.771 --> 00:09:55.760
So I don't think it's systemic racism and like more as the,

178
00:09:55.761 --> 00:09:58.490
that it's a fact of having to like educate.

179
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.060
<v 4>A lot to deal with race in this country. I'll tell my friends on the left.</v>

180
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.450
They literally just see it, that it is a racist country.

181
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.770
We're never not going to be.

182
00:10:06.771 --> 00:10:10.970
And we need like insane change to

183
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.790
just blow up the system. I think that that,

184
00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.160
that would be the most foolish thing.

185
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.810
When you look at who's helping the black community, uh,

186
00:10:19.811 --> 00:10:23.360
I think the president Trump has done a ton for the black community more than

187
00:10:23.361 --> 00:10:25.730
under Emmy, more than under Barack Obama. That's for sure.

188
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:31.340
<v 5>I believe COVID 19 is a serious and real disease.</v>

189
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:37.520
Rachel disagree. Casey. I strongly agree,

190
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.180
Noah. I somewhat agree. Amy

191
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:44.743
Alicia.

192
00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:45.673
<v 3>Somewhat agree.</v>

193
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:48.673
<v 5>Somewhat agree.</v>

194
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.170
<v 4>I mean, anything that can cause the death of somebody is serious.</v>

195
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.980
I can strongly agree with that statement while at the same time being against a

196
00:10:57.981 --> 00:10:59.750
lot of the measures that have been taking place,

197
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:04.280
especially over an extended period of time, it's affected my mental health.

198
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.100
And I have a lot of people who are scared to kind of speak out,

199
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.610
but of course the disease itself. Yes, it's real. Yes. It's serious.

200
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:14.120
<v 5>I've known people who have family members who have passed away,</v>

201
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:18.020
but what if I don't believe it's to the degree that the media made it out to be?

202
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:18.680
I mean,

203
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.520
they said really early on 2 million people will die and we're at 200,000 overall

204
00:11:22.521 --> 00:11:25.760
it's most likely been inflated a lot and is a really interesting question for me

205
00:11:25.761 --> 00:11:27.830
because I'm in medical school, I have access to information.

206
00:11:27.831 --> 00:11:29.120
I like the general public doesn't.

207
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:33.980
So the thing I would say is context is not being given to the

208
00:11:33.981 --> 00:11:37.700
general public. I noticed one a week. There was like, Oh my God,

209
00:11:37.701 --> 00:11:41.450
there's been a surge in this state. Well, I know I drive through, uh,

210
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.570
just opened. Was there really a third in cases?

211
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:46.070
Or was there a third and testing?

212
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.810
<v 0>I think that we are being distracted by the real problem in America.</v>

213
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:54.220
And the real problem in America is we're not healthy.

214
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.810
<v 5>Overall. We're one of the sickest countries who is a first world country.</v>

215
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.140
So I think the media has really blown it out of proportion. Um,

216
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:06.120
I don't think it's as serious as it's made out to be it's being politicized.

217
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.230
<v 0>Um, and I don't know if you guys remember in the very beginning when they talked</v>

218
00:12:10.231 --> 00:12:14.670
about this COVID they said that the African-American community was actually,

219
00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:15.931
uh, you know,

220
00:12:15.931 --> 00:12:20.070
more prone to getting the COVID or the Chinese virus got to say it guys going to

221
00:12:20.071 --> 00:12:21.240
say Chinese virus.

222
00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.270
And it makes sense if we want to look at the black community specifically,

223
00:12:24.271 --> 00:12:27.420
when it comes to high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes,

224
00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.830
we got to take that in consideration.

225
00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.680
And unfortunately we can't really compare ourselves to Sweden.

226
00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.660
You can't really compare ourselves to these other countries,

227
00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:37.980
that one have a smaller population and also with healthier lifestyles than we do

228
00:12:37.981 --> 00:12:38.814
as Americans.

229
00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.630
<v 5>I am open to liberal ideas,</v>

230
00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:46.163
Rachel,

231
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.090
a great Casey great Noah.

232
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:56.430
I strongly agree. Totally agree. Elisia.

233
00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:57.893
<v 3>I said agree.</v>

234
00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.660
<v 5>I totally agree.</v>

235
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.020
<v 3>So I said agree,</v>

236
00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:09.210
but like right now they're just like portraying so many radical views

237
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:13.950
that it's like shutting me down from like listening to them entirely like

238
00:13:13.951 --> 00:13:16.110
socialism. That's like the number one for me,

239
00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:21.180
because I know that socialism leads to communism and people cannot tell me

240
00:13:21.181 --> 00:13:21.990
otherwise.

241
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:26.970
And like my family actually like left Nicaragua because of like the

242
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.420
socialist, like stuff and the communism that was happening. So,

243
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.640
and I know a lot of Hispanic people, like,

244
00:13:32.641 --> 00:13:35.070
that's probably why Joe Biden isn't getting like any,

245
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.100
that much support he is getting support, but not that much support him.

246
00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.580
<v 4>Super conservative, but I'm also an urbanist. And I don't mind, uh,</v>

247
00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:45.030
live in a city I'm totally open to it and even apply some, I mean, I'm,

248
00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:47.910
I'm almost vegan. So I had to say that because I'm almost there yet,

249
00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:48.511
but you know,

250
00:13:48.511 --> 00:13:51.780
it's okay for conservatives to care about the environment and things like that.

251
00:13:51.781 --> 00:13:53.220
Something that you would consider liberal.

252
00:13:53.221 --> 00:13:55.470
I especially liked listening to Andrew Yang.

253
00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.250
I it's hard to hate that guy and you just can't. Um, but I, I,

254
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.440
nothing about Joe Biden interests me. My biggest voting issue of all is China.

255
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.590
And I think that it is the common Chinese communist party is the biggest threat

256
00:14:07.591 --> 00:14:09.960
to the global order, but especially the American way.

257
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:12.150
And Joe Biden has made it very clear that he's,

258
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.000
he's really not going to do too much to handle them.

259
00:14:15.001 --> 00:14:16.740
And in the past has actually enabled them.

260
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:22.060
<v 0>Very, very open to having discussions with literally everybody. Um,</v>

261
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:25.170
I'm in Brexit and down here in our Tennessee chapter,

262
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.080
when we are come across black lives matter,

263
00:14:28.081 --> 00:14:31.980
we cross over the street and we talk to them friendly, peacefully,

264
00:14:31.981 --> 00:14:34.560
great conversation. We find a ton of middle ground.

265
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:38.250
We had each other on freaking Facebook, but I feel like leftist today.

266
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:42.030
She just be open and honest and just call themselves Marxist because there's

267
00:14:42.031 --> 00:14:45.480
literally no, pretty much no difference. Now these days, when it looks at,

268
00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.730
when you look at Bernie Sanders, when you look at black lives matter,

269
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:50.310
and then let's add in a bunch of like illegal immigrants,

270
00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:55.280
when we can even take in our own take care of our own people, there's no logic,

271
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:56.690
there's no logic to it.

272
00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:01.220
I'm open to talking and adopting things like who you decide to marry and all

273
00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:03.530
that kind of stuff. I'm open to that.

274
00:15:03.531 --> 00:15:06.650
Give people equal opportunity to succeed.

275
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:11.000
But if you want to look at the LGBTQ stuff for you as an adult,

276
00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:15.260
talking to another adult and consenting to do whatever you do,

277
00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:19.580
but I'm not for is shoving it down. Children's throats. I'm a mom of three.

278
00:15:19.581 --> 00:15:23.750
I don't play that. No. What do you need to talk about to my kids about your, um,

279
00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.670
being willing Steph and what you decide to identity?

280
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:27.320
We don't care if they want to play with the toys.

281
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:33.490
<v 2>Uh, well I work for the gay Republican group. Uh, so I am,</v>

282
00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:38.380
uh, their political director in Pennsylvania and Ohio. And, uh, as far as,

283
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:39.970
as far as gay issues go,

284
00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:44.500
I think that people looking to pass gay marriage or like repeal gamer,

285
00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:45.790
I think that's big government.

286
00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:50.800
I think the government shouldn't decide what is defined as marriage at all.

287
00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.400
Donald Trump has stood for the gays and gay marriage

288
00:15:55.540 --> 00:16:00.460
for a lot longer than Joe Biden has Joe Biden and enter the 2012

289
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:03.910
presidential campaigns still opposing gay marriage.

290
00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.380
And so if we're going to talk about that issue,

291
00:16:05.381 --> 00:16:09.280
then I feel like public opinion has come around on that. I said,

292
00:16:09.281 --> 00:16:12.400
I strongly agree because the high school I graduated from,

293
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:16.030
I was able to graduate with a kid who I believe he worked on Bernie Sanders

294
00:16:16.031 --> 00:16:16.900
campaign at some point.

295
00:16:16.901 --> 00:16:19.120
And I've been able to talk to them frequently since we graduated.

296
00:16:19.121 --> 00:16:21.490
We've had a lot of discussions and we have to understand there's not liberal

297
00:16:21.491 --> 00:16:24.670
problems and conservative problems. There's American problems that we all have.

298
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.040
We just have to, we all have the same end goal.

299
00:16:27.041 --> 00:16:29.760
We just have two different ways to get there. We all want America to be better.

300
00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:31.090
At least I hope we do. I try to,

301
00:16:31.091 --> 00:16:33.730
I try to say what if I'm wrong and what if they're right.

302
00:16:33.731 --> 00:16:35.410
So I can truly see what they think.

303
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:39.760
<v 5>America is better now than it was four years ago.</v>

304
00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:45.850
Rachel strongly agree. Casey.

305
00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:49.990
I strongly agree, Noah. I strongly agree.

306
00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:54.730
AMI Elysium,

307
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:59.470
strongly agree. Strongly agree.

308
00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:04.690
<v 0>Yeah. So I put, I somewhat agree and that kind of actually sucks to say,</v>

309
00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:09.550
cause I, I wish it was strongly agree, but when, in terms of race relations, um,

310
00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:11.680
I feel like I'm taking so many steps backwards.

311
00:17:11.681 --> 00:17:14.950
I never thought that as a millennial and somebody in 2020,

312
00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:19.900
that I would go outside my door and there would be like tension friends. Um,

313
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.660
just so many each other family disowning, each other. Um,

314
00:17:22.661 --> 00:17:26.560
I know I'm experiencing, I've experienced that. I think we have come a long way,

315
00:17:26.561 --> 00:17:28.570
but when it comes to racial matters and stuff,

316
00:17:28.571 --> 00:17:30.790
unfortunately I think we've taken some steps back.

317
00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:35.620
<v 5>I believe all problems are downstream of economics.</v>

318
00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.810
And I think when Trump says,

319
00:17:37.811 --> 00:17:40.930
we're going to do opportunities on is we're going to invest in billions and

320
00:17:40.931 --> 00:17:44.200
billions of dollars into low income areas. But in Detroit,

321
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:45.970
the gentrification that happened,

322
00:17:45.971 --> 00:17:50.040
which I'm a big supporter of it gave specific family.

323
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:54.240
<v 2>Members and my family jobs that paid like four times what they were making</v>

324
00:17:54.241 --> 00:17:56.700
before. And that's because of Didion.

325
00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:01.230
They're now on like one third of downtown Detroit people complain about it.

326
00:18:01.231 --> 00:18:05.400
But before I bet one third of these buildings were abandoned.

327
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:09.600
That's done more for the black community than any president I've known in my

328
00:18:09.601 --> 00:18:13.110
lifetime. I feel the tension that, um, he feels, um,

329
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:16.320
but I do feel like president Trump's the leader to lead us out of that because I

330
00:18:16.321 --> 00:18:20.250
see the Democrat party, they see the pain,

331
00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.620
they use it. People who are hurting,

332
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:26.970
make them hurt a little bit more and become victims to whatever hurt they have,

333
00:18:26.971 --> 00:18:31.170
whether it's racial or otherwise. And I don't, I don't appreciate that.

334
00:18:31.171 --> 00:18:32.580
And I don't think that that's the answer.

335
00:18:32.581 --> 00:18:36.240
I think president Trump's optimism is the answer to the healing that I really

336
00:18:36.241 --> 00:18:36.800
do.

337
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.400
<v 0>I do think that the economy is the biggest thing and probably the only thing</v>

338
00:18:40.401 --> 00:18:43.760
that president Trump can do for us when it comes to race relations.

339
00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.950
I don't personally think that Trump is the answer to race relations because

340
00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.940
that's a bigger discussion as beyond Trump.

341
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:53.780
The best thing that president Trump can do for black America and people of color

342
00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.000
is to just give them the opportunity to thrive.

343
00:18:56.001 --> 00:18:59.660
And I think he's done that great job at that. Especially, you know,

344
00:18:59.661 --> 00:19:02.810
before the China virus took place and everything. Um,

345
00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:07.400
but when it comes to race relations, the media has such a massive part to play.

346
00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:12.200
And I think a first step that we could do as society is hold our mainstream

347
00:19:12.201 --> 00:19:13.400
media accountable.

348
00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:18.110
If we didn't have to dig to see that Trump has denounced white supremacy

349
00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.160
multiple times,

350
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:23.720
and the mainstream was doing their jobs and not adding fuel to the fire. Um,

351
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:26.890
I think maybe as a society, we could all come together and,

352
00:19:26.891 --> 00:19:31.010
and hold the media accountable for the attention that they have caused when it

353
00:19:31.011 --> 00:19:33.290
comes to race relations. I don't think it has anything to do with.

354
00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:37.670
<v 2>America has always had political polarization. We've always had racial issues,</v>

355
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:42.080
but at least we have these problems and we have a robust economy, you know,

356
00:19:42.081 --> 00:19:43.640
in January and February and March,

357
00:19:43.641 --> 00:19:46.010
once Donald Trump gives a second inaugural address,

358
00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.600
we'll see the economy bounce right back.

359
00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:51.230
<v 6>He's not the president in order to gain power.</v>

360
00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.030
When COVID happens,

361
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:57.620
he did not use the opportunity to assert more power than he already

362
00:19:57.621 --> 00:20:02.510
had. It really concerns me when politicians like Joe Biden say,

363
00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:06.650
he's going to make the entire country follow a mandatory mask mandate.

364
00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.670
That's completely unacceptable. It's an overreach of power.

365
00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:15.560
I think a lot of why America is so strong is because we have such a

366
00:20:15.561 --> 00:20:18.950
strong leader like president Trump and he cares.

367
00:20:18.951 --> 00:20:20.930
He genuinely cares about America.

368
00:20:20.931 --> 00:20:24.800
He loves America so much and he also loves the American people.

369
00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.760
So I think it's like super nice to just see that, um,

370
00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:33.620
a president who is enthusiastic to work for this beautiful

371
00:20:33.621 --> 00:20:37.280
country that I love and the American people, which is like you and me.

372
00:20:37.281 --> 00:20:42.020
So on that note, you guys, that is a wrap, great job,

373
00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:44.000
everyone. Bye-bye.
