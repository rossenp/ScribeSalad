00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.280
<v 0>Cancer is a creepy and mysterious thing in the process of trying to</v>

2
00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:07.440
understand it, to get better at killing eggs,

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.090
we discovered a biological paradox that remains unsolved to this day.

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.430
Large animals seem to be immune to cancer, which doesn't make any sense.

5
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.800
The bigger being the more cancer.

6
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:24.420
It should have to understand why we first need to take a look at the

7
00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:25.860
nature of cancer itself.

8
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.390
Our cells are protein.

9
00:00:35.391 --> 00:00:39.980
Robots made out of hundreds of millions of parts guided only by

10
00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:41.060
chemical reactions.

11
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.160
They create and dismantle structures sustain a metabolism to gain energy

12
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.220
or make almost perfect copies of themselves.

13
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.970
We call these complex chemical reactions pathways.

14
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.480
They are biochemical networks upon networks,

15
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.970
intertwined and stacked on top of each other.

16
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.990
Most of them can barely be comprehended by a single human mind,

17
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.220
and yet they function perfectly until they don't

18
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.770
with billions of trillions of reactions happening in thousands of networks over

19
00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:16.130
many years. The question is not if something will go wrong,

20
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.140
but when tiny mistakes add up until the grandiose machinery gets

21
00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:24.200
corrupted to prevent this from getting out of hand,

22
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.860
our cells have killed switches that make them commit suicide,

23
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.890
but these kill switches are not infallible.

24
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.430
If they fail a cell can turn into a cancer cell.

25
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.120
Most of them are slain by the immune system very quickly,

26
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.390
but this is a numbers game and give it enough time.

27
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.860
A cell would accrue enough mistakes slip by are noticed and begin making more of

28
00:01:45.861 --> 00:01:50.570
itself. All animals have to deal with this problem. In general,

29
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.690
the cells of different animals are the same size.

30
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.720
The cells of a mouse aren't smaller than yours.

31
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.610
It just has fewer cells in total and a shorter lifespan, fewer cells,

32
00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:06.590
and a short life means a lower chance of things going wrong, or cells mutated,

33
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.660
or at least it should mean that humans live about 50 times longer and have

34
00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:14.000
1000 times more cells than mice.

35
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.290
Yet the rate of cancer is basically the same in humans and in mice,

36
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.840
even waiter blue whales with about 3000 times more cells than humans don't seem

37
00:02:23.841 --> 00:02:27.950
to get cancer at all. Ready? This is Petos paradox.

38
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.520
The baffling realization that large animals have much,

39
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.590
much less cancer than they should scientists think there are two main ways of

40
00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:41.420
explaining the paradox evolution and tumors solution

41
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.180
one evolve or become a blob of cancer.

42
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.980
As multicellular beings developed a 600 million years ago,

43
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.230
animals became bigger and bigger,

44
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.090
which added more and more cells and hence more and more chances that cells could

45
00:02:56.091 --> 00:02:56.924
be corrupted.

46
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.970
So the collective had to invest in better and better cancer defenses.

47
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.590
The ones that did not died out, but cancer doesn't just happen.

48
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.510
It's a process that involves many individual mistakes and mutations in several

49
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:12.700
specific genes within the same cell.

50
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.010
These genes are called proto-oncogenes and when they mutate it's bad

51
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:21.430
news. For example, with the right mutation,

52
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.750
a cell will lose its ability to kill itself another mutation,

53
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.660
and it will develop the ability to hide another.

54
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.080
And it will send out calls for resources and other one,

55
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.940
and it will multiply quickly. These oncagenes have an antagonist though.

56
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.860
Tumor suppressor genes.

57
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.810
They prevent these critical mutations from happening or order the cell to kill

58
00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:45.940
itself. If they decided to beyond repair,

59
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.040
it turns out that large animals have an increased number of them because of this

60
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.910
and different cells require more mutations than my cells to develop a tumor.

61
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.940
They are not immune, but more resilient.

62
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.510
This adaption probably comes with a cost in some form,

63
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.000
but researchers still aren't sure what it is.

64
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.040
Maybe tumor suppresses make elephants age quicker later in life or slow down how

65
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:11.680
quickly injuries heal. We don't know yet,

66
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.230
but the solution to the paradox may actually be something different hyper tumors

67
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.520
solution to hyper tumors. Yes,

68
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.870
rarely hyper tumors are named after hyper parasites.

69
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.640
The parasites of parasites, hyper tumors, other tumors of tumors.

70
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.180
Cancer can be thought of as a breakdown in cooperation.

71
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.920
Normally cells work together to form structures like organs, tissue,

72
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.570
or elements of the immune system,

73
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.430
but cancer cells are selfish and only work for their own short-term benefit.

74
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.630
If they're successful, they form tumors, huge cancer collectives.

75
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.310
That can be very hard to kill. Making a tumor is hard work though.

76
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.210
Millions or billions of cancer cells multiply rapidly,

77
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.430
which requires a lot of resources and energy.

78
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.990
The amount of nutrients they can steal from the body becomes the limiting factor

79
00:05:04.991 --> 00:05:05.824
for growth.

80
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.150
So the tumor cells trick the body to build new blood vessels directly to the

81
00:05:10.151 --> 00:05:12.130
tumor to feed the thing, killing ism.

82
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.780
And here the nature of cancer cells may become their own undoing.

83
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.090
Cancer cells are inherently unstable and so they can continue to mutate

84
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.500
some of them faster than their buddies. If they do this for a while,

85
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.513
at some point,

86
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.600
one of the copies of the copies of the original cancer cell might suddenly think

87
00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:35.080
of itself as an individual again, and stop cooperating,

88
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.270
which means just like the body,

89
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.680
the original tumor suddenly becomes an enemy fighting for the same scarce,

90
00:05:41.681 --> 00:05:43.030
nutrients and resources.

91
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.760
So the Nudie mutated cells can create a hyper tumor instead

92
00:05:48.761 --> 00:05:51.730
of helping. They cut off the blood supply to their former buddies,

93
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.820
which will stop and kill the original cancer cells.

94
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.810
Cancer is killing cancer. This process can repeat over and over.

95
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.070
And this may prevent cancer from becoming a problem for a large organism.

96
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.660
It is possible that large animals have more of these hyper tumors than we

97
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:12.830
realize they might just not become big enough to notice, which makes sense.

98
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.310
A two gram tumor is 10% of a mouse's body weight.

99
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.630
One it's less than 0.002% of a human and

100
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.530
2e-06% of a blue whale.

101
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.730
All three tumors require the same number of cell divisions and have the same

102
00:06:28.731 --> 00:06:29.630
number of cells.

103
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.280
So an old blue whale might be filled with tiny cancers and just not care.

104
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.940
There are other proposed solutions to Peter's paradox,

105
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.660
such as different metabolic rates or different Salita architecture.

106
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.650
But right now we just don't know, scientists are working on the problem,

107
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.240
figuring out how large animals are so resilient to one of the most deadly

108
00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:54.200
diseases we know could open the path to new therapies and treatments.

109
00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.600
<v 1>Cancer has always been a challenge today.</v>

110
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.980
<v 0>We are finally beginning to understand it. And by doing so one day,</v>

111
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.230
we might finally overcome it.

we only want to put things into the world that we feel good about coats.

120
