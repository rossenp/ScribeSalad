00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.180
<v 0>What is the largest star in the universe and why is it that large and what</v>

2
00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:10.920
are stars anyway, things that would like to be stars.

3
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.030
We begin our journey with earth, not to learn anything,

4
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.980
just to get a vague sense of scale.

5
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.140
The smallest things that have some Starlight properties are large gas giants,

6
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.020
or sub Brown dwarfs like Jupiter,

7
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.510
the most massive planet in the solar system,

8
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.910
11 times larger and 317 times more massive than earth and more or

9
00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:37.200
less made of the same stuff as our sun, just much, much less of it.

10
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.430
The transition towards stars begins with Brown wolves,

11
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.060
failed stars that are a huge disappointment to their mums.

12
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.290
They have between 13 and 90 times the massive Jupiter.

13
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.280
So even if we took 90 Jupiters and through the mud, each other,

14
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.940
although fun to watch, it wouldn't be enough to create star.

15
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.020
Interestingly, adding lots of mass to a Brown dwarf,

16
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.740
doesn't make it much bigger. Just-it's insides denser.

17
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.750
This increases the pressure in the core enough to make certain nuclear fusion

18
00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:13.160
reactions happens slowly. And the object glow a little.

19
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.590
So Brown dwarfs are a sort of glowy gas giant that don't fit into any

20
00:01:18.591 --> 00:01:23.210
category very well. But we want to talk about stars, not failed,

21
00:01:23.211 --> 00:01:27.950
want to be stars. So let's move on main sequence stars.

22
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.390
Once large gospels pass a certain mass threshold,

23
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.600
their cause become hotter and dense enough to ignite.

24
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.270
Hydrogen is fused to helium and they're cause releasing tremendous

25
00:01:41.271 --> 00:01:45.860
amounts of energy stars that do that are called main sequence stars.

26
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.240
The more massive a main sequence star is the hotter and brighter. It burns.

27
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.340
And the shorter its life is once the hydrogen burning phase is over,

28
00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.380
stars grow up to hundreds of thousands of times, their original size,

29
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.240
but these giant phases only last for a fraction of their lifespan.

30
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.460
So we'll be comparing stars at drastically different stages in their lives.

31
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.920
This doesn't make them less impressive,

32
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.510
but maybe it's good to keep in mind that we'll be comparing babies to adults.

33
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.880
Now, back to the beginning, the smallest real stars are red wolves.

34
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.620
About 100 times the massive Jupiter barely massive enough to fuse

35
00:02:27.621 --> 00:02:32.270
hydrogen to helium because they are not very massive. They are small,

36
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.610
not very hot and shine, pretty dimly.

37
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.350
They are the only stars in the main sequence that don't grow once they die,

38
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.100
but sorta of fizz Laos red door.

39
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.750
So are by far the most abundant type in the universe because they burn their

40
00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:51.980
fuel very slowly. It lasts them up to 10 trillion years,

41
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.600
a thousand times the current age of the universe, for example,

42
00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.970
one of the closest stars to earth is a red star Barnard star,

43
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.790
but it shines to Dimmi to be seen without a telescope.

44
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.100
We made a whole video on red Wolf's. If you want to learn more, the next stage,

45
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.290
our stars like our sun to say the sun dominates the soda system is not doing

46
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:19.090
it justice. Since it makes up at 99.8, 6% of all its mass.

47
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.110
It burns far hotter and brighter than red dwarfs,

48
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.350
which reduces its lifetime to about 10 billion years.

49
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.950
The sun is seven times more massive than Barnard star,

50
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.810
but that makes it nearly 300 times brighter with twice its surface temperature

51
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.150
let's go bigger.

52
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.460
Small changes in mass produce enormous changes in a main sequence stars,

53
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:45.730
brightness. The brightest star in the night sky.

54
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.130
Sirius is two solar masses with a radius, 1.7 times that of the sun,

55
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.930
but its surface is nearly 10,000 degrees Celsius making it shine

56
00:03:55.931 --> 00:04:00.490
25 times brighter burning that heart reduces its total

57
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.890
lifespan. By four times to 2.5 billion years stars

58
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:07.150
close to 10 times.

59
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.800
The mass of our sun have surface temperatures near 25,000 degrees Celsius.

60
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.080
Beta centaury contains two of these massive stars each shining with about

61
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:19.330
20,000 times. The power of the sun.

62
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.950
That's a lot of power coming from something only 13 times larger,

63
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.850
but they'll only burden about 20 million years.

64
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.250
Entire generations of these blue stars die in the time it takes the sun to

65
00:04:32.251 --> 00:04:36.300
orbit the galaxy once. So is this the formula?

66
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.150
The more massive, the larger the star,

67
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.680
the most massive star that we know is our one three, six 81.

68
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.320
It has 315 solar masses and is nearly 9 million times brighter

69
00:04:49.321 --> 00:04:53.730
than the sun. And yet, despite its tremendous mass and power,

70
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.580
it's barely 30 times the size of the sun.

71
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.190
The star is so extreme and barely held together by gravity that it loses

72
00:05:02.191 --> 00:05:06.660
321,000 billion tons of material through its stellar wind.

73
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.000
Every single second stars of this sort are extremely rare

74
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.150
because they break the rules of star formation a tiny bit.

75
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.640
When supermassive stars are born,

76
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.590
they burn extremely hot and bright and this blows away any extra gas that could

77
00:05:22.591 --> 00:05:23.790
make them more massive.

78
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.770
So the mass limit for such a star is around 150 times. The sun,

79
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.440
the stars like are one, three, six, eight,

80
00:05:31.441 --> 00:05:35.550
one are probably formed through the merger of several high mass stars in den

81
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.851
star,

82
00:05:35.851 --> 00:05:40.710
forming regions and burn that core hydrogen in only a few million years.

83
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.540
So this means they are rare and short-lived from here,

84
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.310
the trick to going bigger, isn't adding more mass to make the biggest stars.

85
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.300
You have to kill them. Red giants.

86
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.880
When main sequence stars begin exhaust the hydrogen in their core,

87
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.820
it contracts making it hotter and denser.

88
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.820
This leads to hotter and faster fusion,

89
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.680
which pushes back against gravity and makes the outer layers swell in a giant

90
00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:13.910
phase. And these stars become truly giant. Indeed.

91
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.610
For example, God Crocs only 30% more massive than the sun.

92
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.200
It has swollen to about 84 times its radius still.

93
00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:26.510
When the sun enters the last stage of its life,

94
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.090
it will swell and become even bigger.

95
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.370
200 times its current radius in this funnel phase of its life.

96
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.570
It will swallow the inner planets. And if you think that's impressive,

97
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.160
let's finally introduce the largest stars in the universe. Hyper giants,

98
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.620
hyper giants are the giant phase of the most massive stars in the universe.

99
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:54.440
They have an enormous surface area that can radiate an insane amount of light

100
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.420
being so large.

101
00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:01.430
They're basically blowing themselves apart as gravity at the surface is too

102
00:07:01.431 --> 00:07:06.230
weak to hold onto the hot mass, which is lifted away in powerful stellar wins.

103
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.650
Pistol star is 25 solar masses,

104
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.350
but 300 times the radius of the sun,

105
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.370
a blue hyper giant aptly named for its energetic blue Starlight.

106
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.480
It's hard to say exactly how long pistol star will live,

107
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.790
but probably just a few million years,

108
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.020
even larger than the blue hyper giants or the yellow hyper giants.

109
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:31.160
The most well-studied ISRO Cassiopeia a so bright.

110
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:32.900
It could be seen with the naked eye,

111
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.910
although it's thousands of light years from earth at 40 SOTA masses.

112
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.230
This star is around 500 times the radius of the sun and

113
00:07:42.231 --> 00:07:44.360
500,000 times brighter.

114
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.620
If the earth were as close to RO Cassiopeia, as it is to the sun,

115
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:53.660
it would be inside is and you would be very Dez yellow,

116
00:07:53.661 --> 00:07:56.990
hyper giants are very raveled, only 15 and own.

117
00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:02.540
This means they're likely just a short-lived intermediate state as a star

118
00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:06.080
grows or shrinks between other phases of hyper lists.

119
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:11.060
With red hyper giants, we reached the largest stars known to us,

120
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.850
probably the largest stars even possible.

121
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:19.040
So who's the winner of this insane contest? Well,

122
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.780
the truth is we don't know.

123
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:25.700
Red hyper giants are extremely bright and far away,

124
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:30.140
which means that even tiny uncertainties in our measurements can give us a huge

125
00:08:30.141 --> 00:08:34.550
margin of error for their size worse, still red hyper giants,

126
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.420
our solar system size behemoths that are blowing themselves apart,

127
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:43.550
which makes them harder to measure as we do more science and our instruments

128
00:08:43.551 --> 00:08:46.970
improve whatever the largest star is, we'll change.

129
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:52.070
The star that is currently thought to be among the largest we found is Stevenson

130
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.910
two 18. It was probably born as a main sequence star, a few tens of times,

131
00:08:56.911 --> 00:09:00.090
the mass of the sun and has likely lost about half its mass.

132
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:04.920
By now while typical red hyper giants are 1,500

133
00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:06.450
times the size of the sun,

134
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.530
the largest rough estimate places at Stevenson two 18 at

135
00:09:10.531 --> 00:09:15.510
2,150 solar radiation and shining with almost half a

136
00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:19.620
million times. The power of the sun by comparison,

137
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:21.750
the sun seems like a great of dust.

138
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:26.250
Our brains don't really have a way of grasping this kind of scale.

139
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:31.710
Even at light speed, it would take you 8.7 hours to travel around at once.

140
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.910
The fastest plane on earth would take around 500 years,

141
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.010
dropped on the sun.

142
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:42.060
It would fill Saturn's orbit as it evolves.

143
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:47.010
It will probably shed even more masks and shrink down into another hotter hyper

144
00:09:47.011 --> 00:09:51.390
giant phase accumulate heavy elements in its core before finally

145
00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:54.270
exploding in a core collapses supernova,

146
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.670
giving its gas back to the galaxy.

147
00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:02.370
This gas will then go on to form another generation of stars of all sizes,

148
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:07.740
starting the cycle of birth and death. Again, to light up our universe.

149
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:12.450
Let's make this journey again, but this time without the talking,

150
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.860
the universe is big. There are many large things in there.

151
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:35.953
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

152
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:40.850
<v 0>If you want to play a bit more with size stuff, we have good news.</v>

153
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:45.740
We've created our first app universe in a nutshell together with Tim urban,

154
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.000
the brain behind wait,

155
00:10:47.001 --> 00:10:51.050
but why you can seamlessly travel from the smallest things in existence,

156
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.530
past the Corona virus, human cells and dinosaurs,

157
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:59.690
all the way to the largest stars and galaxies and Marvel at the whole observable

158
00:10:59.691 --> 00:11:00.524
universe,

159
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:05.750
you can learn more about each object or simply enjoy the sheer scale of it.

160
00:11:05.751 --> 00:11:09.320
All the app is inspired by the scale of the universe website,

161
00:11:09.321 --> 00:11:13.100
by the human twins that we spent a lot of time with when it came out years ago

162
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:16.940
and felt that it was finally time to create a wait, but why and coats,

163
00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.550
Zack version, you can get it in your app store.

164
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:24.410
There are no in-app purchases and no ads. All future updates are included.

165
00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.450
