00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.580
<v 0>The desire to be free from the limits of the human experience is as old as our</v>

2
00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:09.450
first stories, we exist in an endless universe,

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.730
only bound by the laws of physics.

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.050
And yet our consciousness is trapped in mortal machines,

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.580
made of meat with the breathtaking explosion of innovation and

6
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:22.290
progress. For the first time,

7
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.390
the concept of leaving our flesh pals behind and uploading our minds

8
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.340
into a digital utopia seems possible even like the logical

9
00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:34.470
next step on our evolutionary ladder,

10
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.350
mind uploading and digital immortality past some of the core themes of the games

11
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:42.000
cyberpunk 2077.

12
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.220
It plays in a grim dystopian future where humanity has progressed far beyond

13
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:51.120
today's technology and explores what this could mean for humanity.

14
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:52.800
About a year ago,

15
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.640
CD Projekt red asked us if we would like to make a video about some of these

16
00:00:56.641 --> 00:01:01.620
ideas and we were immediately on board. So let's explore this topic together.

17
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.870
Is it possible to upload your mind into a computer? Well,

18
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.490
it's complicated.

19
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.283
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

20
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.080
<v 0>Upload what exactly mind is.</v>

21
00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.470
One of those words that are really hard to define,

22
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.290
it's thought to be the collective abilities of your consciousness and

23
00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:28.124
intelligence.

24
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.660
The thing that lets you imagine recognize and dream mind

25
00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:37.040
uploading is the hypothetical concept of making a copy of this in a world and

26
00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:41.210
transferring it into a computer to run a simulation of your consciousness.

27
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.650
But even defining the premise gets really hard, ready, fast.

28
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.910
The possibility of mind uploading is based on three assumptions.

29
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.070
Assumption one, your mind is in your brains structure,

30
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.170
arrangement, and biochemistry.

31
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.790
The idea that everything about the mind can be found in the brain is called

32
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.840
physicalism and it keeps out discussion within the domain of natural law

33
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.710
assumption two. At some point,

34
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:14.000
we will understand the brain well enough and possess the technology to simulate

35
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.650
all of its aspects, to make a digital mind. Copy assumption,

36
00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:22.490
three computer software can host your mind,

37
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.070
which means the mind is computable.

38
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.160
There is no physical property in the brain,

39
00:02:28.161 --> 00:02:31.430
including consciousness that cannot be simulated accurately.

40
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.500
Even if it requires a lot of code.

41
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.150
All of these assumptions have been proposed and challenged by scientists and

42
00:02:38.151 --> 00:02:38.960
philosophers,

43
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.400
and they remain the subject of passionate debate with so many fundamental

44
00:02:43.401 --> 00:02:45.020
questions. Still unanswered.

45
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.960
It's hard to discuss the topic without annoying someone,

46
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.330
whatever your position,

47
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.810
every discussion of mind upload has to begin with the brain.

48
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.390
The brain, in a nutshell,

49
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.860
the brain is the most biological structure known and deserves its own entire

50
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:05.620
video. So let's just take a brief look at it.

51
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.410
Around 100 billion neurons are communicating via 1 million billion

52
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:15.580
connections that are sending signals up to 1000 times each second,

53
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.690
which is one quadrillion events, every second of your waking life.

54
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.970
And it's not just neurons.

55
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.230
There are billions of supporting and immune cells of various types,

56
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:29.110
performing different jobs on a macro level,

57
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:33.280
the brain could be divided into sections with different roles from breathing and

58
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:37.060
heart rate to coordinating movement and involuntary reflexes.

59
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.490
The most developed parts,

60
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.390
the neocortex or the outermost layer of the brain hold memories.

61
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.500
Our ability to plan think and imagine hope and dream

62
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.020
where exactly the you part of the brain is situated is not entirely clear.

63
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.610
We know that areas like the [inaudible] cortex have the greatest influence on

64
00:03:57.611 --> 00:03:58.444
our consciousness,

65
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.320
but also that several areas can network together to share tasks.

66
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.060
None of them can do alone. The brains building blocks are not exactly simple.

67
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.970
Either neurons are not just wires.

68
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.280
They alter and process information.

69
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.410
Signups is where signals are handed over from one neuron to the next contain

70
00:04:17.411 --> 00:04:19.720
receptors. For hundreds of chemical signals,

71
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.850
opening them up to outside influence.

72
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.740
We have a basic understanding of how these work and we can accurately predict

73
00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:28.450
their behavior at small scales,

74
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.570
but there's a lot more to the brain than just nerve signals.

75
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.330
Hormones play a huge role like serotonin, which affects our mood or histamine,

76
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.040
which helps us learn. The brain is influenced by our other parts too.

77
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.080
From heart nerves to gut bacteria.

78
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.460
What seemed like a very complicated system to begin with gets even more

79
00:04:48.461 --> 00:04:53.050
complicated. The more we learn about it to get this worldly, interconnected,

80
00:04:53.051 --> 00:04:55.960
massive cells and meat and chemicals into a computer.

81
00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.850
We need a model that we can simulate in our digital world. Some sort of scam.

82
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.830
Unfortunately,

83
00:05:02.831 --> 00:05:07.480
our scanning technology like FMR machines is not nearly good enough to attempt

84
00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:11.170
such a thing, but there is a different method that seems very promising.

85
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.880
Cutting a brain into tiny slices and scanning them with a high resolution

86
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.740
electron microscope to create an accurate map of all the cells and connections.

87
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:22.570
<v 2>In 2019.</v>

88
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.530
<v 0>Scientists successfully mapped to eight cubic millimeter of mouse brain,</v>

89
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.900
roughly the size of a big grain of sand.

90
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.300
It contained 100,000 neurons with a billion signups is and four

91
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:35.920
kilometers of nerve fibers.

92
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.780
This grain of brain was cut into 25,000 slices.

93
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.130
Five electron microscopes ran continuously for five months,

94
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.590
collecting more than 100 billion images.

95
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.610
It took three months to assemble the images into a 3d model.

96
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.010
The completed dataset fills up 2 million gigabytes of cloud storage

97
00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.540
to scan a whole human brain.

98
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.330
We would have to repeat this effort a million times,

99
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.190
which is much easier said than done,

100
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.730
even worse to correctly simulate a brain.

101
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.360
We might even have to map out much smaller building blocks to include the

102
00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:16.280
billions of underlying proteins or even individual molecules that cause all the

103
00:06:16.281 --> 00:06:18.680
behaviors we see at the cellular level,

104
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.050
which might produce more data than the capacity of all data storage on earth,

105
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:26.780
brain water,

106
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.700
to consciousness wine while all of these issues are annoying.

107
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.960
The real question is how we turn the static blueprint of the brain into an

108
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.830
active thing.

109
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.260
Even if we have a scan down to the level of signups is we need laws and rules

110
00:06:42.261 --> 00:06:46.370
that animate the wiring diagram to endow this static structure with a life,

111
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.320
update it with the various laws of chemical binding of electrodynamics to

112
00:06:51.321 --> 00:06:55.610
animate the simulation. So it becomes a dynamic active thing,

113
00:06:55.611 --> 00:07:00.110
like a brain that exists from one microsecond to the next that can evolve in

114
00:07:00.111 --> 00:07:02.450
time think, see, and act.

115
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.100
The reality is that we just don't know if this is possible to achieve.

116
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.630
If our technology can give rise to real minds,

117
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.660
it all hinges on the nature of the problem are the brain and mind

118
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.330
just complicated and a lot of work to figure out,

119
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.790
or are they complex in a way that we can't solve in the worst case?

120
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.780
Consciousness is more than the sum of the parts of the brain in a way that we

121
00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:34.640
don't realize yet complex in a way that we can't solve by getting better

122
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:36.043
scans,

123
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:40.280
just having a list of the ingredients might not be enough to get a good

124
00:07:40.281 --> 00:07:41.330
consciousness cake.

125
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.790
Right now we have a great starting point with tangible scientific results and an

126
00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:47.624
end goal.

127
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.700
But the road to true simulation is unclear and requires a lot of innovation

128
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:53.563
and research

129
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:59.600
Schumann's have historically been horrible at predicting the pace of progress

130
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:01.483
in the best case.

131
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.730
It's just a matter of doing the work and finding the right solutions.

132
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:09.350
It might not be necessary to simulate every last cell down to the last atom.

133
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:10.431
Instead,

134
00:08:10.431 --> 00:08:14.990
it may be possible to simplify elements into probabilistic models that could

135
00:08:14.991 --> 00:08:19.070
match the behavior of the brain using a more manageable number of simpler

136
00:08:19.071 --> 00:08:19.904
systems.

137
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.680
So we really don't know if we will ever understand our brain and consciousness

138
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:26.990
well enough to upload human minds,

139
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.640
but the science is real and worth pursuing. At the very least,

140
00:08:31.641 --> 00:08:34.940
we will just learn a lot about ourselves and develop a bunch of new

141
00:08:34.941 --> 00:08:37.310
technologies. If we succeed,

142
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:41.270
this might put mind uploading well within the capabilities of our rapidly

143
00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:42.920
progressing computer technology.

144
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:48.590
The consequences for humanity and our future in this universe are vast,

145
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.930
creepy and amazing.

146
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.970
The copy successful mind uploading is functional

147
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.670
immortality unless damaged or deleted. You will continue to, to exist.

148
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.580
As long as the copy is stored somewhere. Of course,

149
00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.790
the scan is corrupted in any of a myriad of ways.

150
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.190
Your mind might get interrupted too.

151
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:15.770
You might be in an eternity of pain or paranoia or having an endless psychotic

152
00:09:15.771 --> 00:09:17.900
breakdown. The question,

153
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:22.640
if this digital mind is you opens another whole can of worms for now,

154
00:09:22.641 --> 00:09:26.510
we'll just assume that your digital mind at least feels like it's you.

155
00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.650
How would mind uploading change your outlook on life?

156
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:36.230
Will you feel safer knowing that death is not necessarily the end or

157
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.400
would you try to be super safe to avoid dying before your mind is uploaded?

158
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.270
If scanning technology does become advanced enough,

159
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:49.160
your biological and digital versions could co-exist,

160
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:53.360
you could help me each other out by making your biological lifespan more

161
00:09:53.361 --> 00:09:56.510
enjoyable. And the future of the copy, more secure,

162
00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:01.490
whatever happens your mind copy will begin a completely new life.

163
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.380
Once it opens their digital eyes for the first time having a functional body is

164
00:10:06.381 --> 00:10:10.940
actually quite nice and you're pretty used to it. Food love,

165
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:15.500
pain and exhaustion. All of these things are parts of us that we must live with,

166
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.550
but in the end, they are the result of neurons firing in your brain.

167
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:23.420
So while you could decide to live in a simulated body,

168
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.760
it might be optional for a digital mind.

169
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.500
Falling in love might lose meaning if you can have it at the press of a button

170
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:35.780
instead, you might end up searching for new extraordinary experiences.

171
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:38.210
Walk on the surface of the sun,

172
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.750
speed up time to skip past a few boring mumps

173
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:45.800
experience, a simulation of the past.

174
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:49.610
Your perspectives and priorities will change.

175
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.940
As you continue to exist in this liberated form,

176
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.940
the longer digital minds exist,

177
00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:00.290
eventually they will likely gain greater knowledge of themselves and inability

178
00:11:00.291 --> 00:11:01.820
to change their own contacts.

179
00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.210
This can be as simple as deleting a memory that bugs you.

180
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:10.370
You might change aspects of your personality, my grudges, addictions,

181
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.730
or laziness without the constraints of biology,

182
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:18.530
your abilities might move up as technology progresses while your priorities or

183
00:11:18.531 --> 00:11:21.860
goals might become more and more foreign to your original brain.

184
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.180
If it's still alive,

185
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:28.430
waking up to the true potential of digital immortality will be gradual.

186
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.360
You can start projects that would take more than a lifetime to complete

187
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:36.800
scientists could accumulate an incredible amount of knowledge leading to

188
00:11:36.801 --> 00:11:39.110
discoveries that could revolutionize the world.

189
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:44.120
Adventurers could upload themselves onto small spaceships and embark on journeys

190
00:11:44.121 --> 00:11:48.950
to the stars. Just putting themselves on pause for thousands of years at a time.

191
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.370
Although it's unlikely that every digital mind will work for the benefit of

192
00:11:54.371 --> 00:11:57.580
humanity. Since our current meet versions,

193
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.710
don't do that either some will seek power and influence and we'll have a literal

194
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:04.990
eternity of trying to create empires.

195
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:09.760
Others will begin hoarding as many resources for themselves as possible as they

196
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:14.110
compete with other minds trying to do the same, the longer they live,

197
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:19.090
the less sympathy they may feel for simple meet beings or imagine

198
00:12:19.091 --> 00:12:23.080
immortal current leaders who propagate lies and invent religions

199
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.800
fine-tuning and perfecting their dogma over hundreds of years,

200
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:32.290
or perhaps none of all that maybe our minds are not made for

201
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:37.150
immortality and digital minds will just become rigid and unproductive

202
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:39.550
and retire. After a very long life,

203
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.100
having experienced to everything they could ever want to.

204
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.740
It's hard to predict how much good or bad a self-improving mind could do

205
00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:51.850
with hundreds or thousands of years of free time.

206
00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:55.150
<v 1>While.</v>

207
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:59.230
<v 0>Mind upload with all its wonders and Horace is beyond our current technological</v>

208
00:12:59.231 --> 00:13:00.064
capabilities.

209
00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.640
You can use some of your free time in the present and experience one

210
00:13:03.641 --> 00:13:08.080
interpretation of this future right away by hitting the streets of night city in

211
00:13:08.081 --> 00:13:09.910
cyberpunk 2077,

212
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:14.050
cyberpunk 2077 is made by CD Projekt red.

213
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.740
The studio that brought us the Witcher series and is one of the most eagerly

214
00:13:17.741 --> 00:13:19.840
awaited games of the last few years.

215
00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:24.700
You dive into a dark dystopian future where incredible technology is redefining

216
00:13:24.701 --> 00:13:25.660
who and what we are.

217
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:30.010
You can become part of this stunningly large world with immersive storytelling.

218
00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:34.240
Here's the thing we haven't played the game yet, but when you see this video,

219
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:38.860
we're probably already doing so if the past work of city project red is any

220
00:13:38.861 --> 00:13:41.320
indication, then this will be an amazing game,

221
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:45.820
which is why we did this collaboration and sat on this video for far too long.

222
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.550
So if it's made you curious, check it out.
