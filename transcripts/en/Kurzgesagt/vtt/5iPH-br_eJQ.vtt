00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.140
<v 0>Playing around with nuclear weapons in videos is fun.</v>

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.250
There's a visceral joy in blowing things up and a horrifying fascination with

3
00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:11.100
things like five balls, shockwaves, and radiation,

4
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.670
and what it does help put out a structure of power and perspective.

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.720
It's not the best way of understanding the real impact of a nuclear explosion.

6
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.120
This isn't about city stacks of TNT or about how bright an explosion is.

7
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.580
Nuclear weapons are about you.

8
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.620
So we've partnered with the red cross and red Crescent movement to explore what

9
00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:35.910
would really happen if a nuclear weapon were detonated in a major city today,

10
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.610
not nuclear war, just one explosion.

11
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.000
We begin our story in the middle of downtown in a major city,

12
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.210
people are going to work studying for exams, uh,

13
00:00:56.211 --> 00:00:59.510
lost in their thoughts and daily lives right here.

14
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.750
A nuclear weapon is detonators and time freezes.

15
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.640
The first phase of the explosion happens within less than a second in a

16
00:01:07.641 --> 00:01:08.420
millisecond,

17
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.530
a ball of plasma hotter than the sun appears and grows in a fireball to more

18
00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:17.210
than two kilometers across within this ball. Everyone is just gone.

19
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.130
Think of water dripped onto a very hot pan, a sizzle,

20
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.020
and then there's nothing. Most buildings, cars, trees,

21
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.150
tacky, sculptures, and people all evaporated. First,

22
00:01:32.151 --> 00:01:36.350
the flash and intense tsunami of light washes over the city. In an instant.

23
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.690
<v 1>If you happen.</v>

24
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.270
<v 0>To have your head pointed in the direction of the explosion,</v>

25
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.520
it renders you blind for a few hours.

26
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.210
The heat of this light produces a thermal pals,

27
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.720
so energetic and hot that it just burns everything.

28
00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:53.390
As far as 13 kilometers from the destination site.

29
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.670
What this means is that everything in an area of 500 square kilometers that is

30
00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:03.440
able to burn starts burning plastic, wood fabric,

31
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.030
hair, and skin. If you happen to be in reach of the thermal pulse,

32
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.990
one moment, you're on your way to work. The next moment you're on fire.

33
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.000
Now, the second phase begins. It happens in a few seconds.

34
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.410
Most people will. Now first notice that something is wrong,

35
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.990
but it's already too late. For hundreds of thousands.

36
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.810
The flash is followed by the shockwave,

37
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.460
the heat and radiation of the fireball create a bubble of superheated and super

38
00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:32.600
compressed air around us.

39
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.040
That's now expanding explosively faster than the speed of sound,

40
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.430
creating winds stronger than hurricanes and tornadoes.

41
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.640
Human infrastructure is no match for its power.

42
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.050
Most major buildings within a kilometer of the fireball are just ground up,

43
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.160
down to their base.

44
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.200
Only steel reinforced concrete is able to partially resist the pressure in the

45
00:02:54.201 --> 00:02:57.290
surrounding parks, where it retirees feed the ducks trees,

46
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.180
blackened and smoldering from the heater. Second before snap like toothpicks.

47
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.470
If you're outside, you get tossed away like a grain of dust and a tornado.

48
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.470
The shockwave weakens as it travels outwards,

49
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.000
but still about 175 square kilometers of houses collapsed.

50
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.380
Like they're made of cards,

51
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.460
trapping tens of thousands of people who didn't have any time to react.

52
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.450
Gas stations, explode and fire spread throughout the rebel.

53
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.040
A mushroom cloud made from the remains of the fireball dust and Ash rises

54
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:31.660
kilometers into the sky in the next few minutes and casts a dark shadow over the

55
00:03:31.661 --> 00:03:36.160
ruined city. This violently pause in fresh air surrounding the city,

56
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.790
destroying more buildings and providing an abundance of oxygen.

57
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.720
It depends on the city. What happens next? If there's enough,

58
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.170
fuel fires may turn into a firestorm that burns the rubble,

59
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.400
everybody trapped in it.

60
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.960
And people trying to flee the devastation up to 21 kilometers from the

61
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:53.650
explosion.

62
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.250
People just like you rush to their windows to take pictures of the mushroom

63
00:03:57.251 --> 00:04:01.510
cloud, unaware that the shockwave is still coming at them about to shatter their

64
00:04:01.511 --> 00:04:04.180
windows and create a blizzard of sharp glass.

65
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.260
The third phase begins in the coming hours and days.

66
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.620
We're used to the idea that help will come no matter the disaster.

67
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.420
This time is different.

68
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.500
A nuclear explosion is like every natural disaster at once.

69
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.910
There are hundreds of thousands or millions of people with serious injuries,

70
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.920
lacerations, broken bones, serious burns in the next few minutes and hours,

71
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.500
thousands more will die because of these injuries.

72
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.470
Countless people at tramped in collapsed buildings like in earthquakes,

73
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.880
all blinded by the flash Def from the blast wave and are unable to fly through

74
00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:40.360
streets,

75
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.190
impossible with rubble and debris that terrified confused and

76
00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:46.840
don't know what's happened to them all.

77
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.280
Why most likely many hospitals have been leveled along with all the other

78
00:04:51.281 --> 00:04:51.910
buildings.

79
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.660
And most of medical professionals are either dead or injured along with everyone

80
00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:56.494
else.

81
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.860
The survivors lucky enough to have been in Metro tunnels or standing in the

82
00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:01.150
right place to be unburned.

83
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.860
And unhurt won't have truly escaped harm yet depending on the type of weapon

84
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.910
where it explodes.

85
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.710
And even the weather an awful black rain can begin with a radioactive Ash and

86
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.640
dust descending on the city covering everything and everyone,

87
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.770
the invisible malicious silent horror of radiation takes its turn.

88
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.020
Every breath carries poison to the lungs of the survivors. Over the coming days,

89
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.950
the people who received the highest doses of radiation exposure will die.

90
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.720
There will be no help,

91
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.640
not for hours or maybe even days civilization doesn't operate.

92
00:05:36.641 --> 00:05:40.960
When there is a total breakdown of infrastructure, roads of blogs, train tracks,

93
00:05:40.961 --> 00:05:45.610
walks, runways clustered with rebel, no water, no electricity,

94
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.900
no communication,

95
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.820
no stores to replenish supplies from help from surrounding cities will have a

96
00:05:51.821 --> 00:05:55.120
hard time entering the disaster zone. And even if they can,

97
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.990
the radioactive contamination will it risky to get too close after a

98
00:05:59.991 --> 00:06:02.060
nuclear attack, you're on your own.

99
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.910
So bit by bit people emerge from the rubble on foot contaminated with

100
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.000
radioactive fallout, carrying what little they may have left.

101
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.800
They are slow in pain traumatized, and they all need food,

102
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.020
water and medical treatment fast.

103
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.030
And the damage done by a nuclear weapon doesn't end when the fires burn out and

104
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:26.270
the smoke clears, the hospitals in the neighboring says is,

105
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.800
are under equipped for a disaster of this scale and overwhelmed with tens or

106
00:06:30.801 --> 00:06:35.240
hundreds of thousands of patients with serious injuries in the weeks, months,

107
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.320
and years to come.

108
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.280
Many of those who survived will succumb to cancers like leukemia.

109
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.690
The reason no government wants you to think about all this is because there is

110
00:06:44.691 --> 00:06:48.290
no serious humanitarian response possible to a nuclear explosion.

111
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.340
There's no way to really help the immediate victims of a nuclear attack.

112
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:57.170
This is not a hurricane wildfire or earthquake or nuclear accident.

113
00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.770
It is all of these things at once, but worse,

114
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.040
no nation on earth is prepared to deal with it.

115
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.900
The world has changed in the past few years with world leaders, again,

116
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.680
explicitly and publicly threatening each other with nuclear weapons.

117
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.750
Many experts think the danger of a nuclear strike is higher than it has been in

118
00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:18.584
decades.

119
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.520
Governments tell their citizens that it's good that we have nuclear weapons,

120
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.070
but it's bad when anyone else gets them,

121
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.990
that it's somehow necessary to threaten others with mass destruction to keep us

122
00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:32.720
safe. But does this make you feel safe?

123
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.100
It only takes a small group of people with power to go crazy or rogue,

124
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.810
a small misstep or a simple misunderstanding to unleash a catastrophe of

125
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:46.280
unimaginable proportions exploding stuff in videos is fun,

126
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.880
exploding things in real life. Not so much.

127
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.370
That is a solution though.

128
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.790
Eliminating all nuclear weapons and vowing,

129
00:07:55.791 --> 00:07:58.640
never to build them again in 2017,

130
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.900
almost two thirds of all the world's countries supported by hundreds of civil

131
00:08:02.901 --> 00:08:06.530
society organizations and the international red cross and red Crescent movement

132
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.650
agreed to prohibit and eliminate nuclear weapons.

133
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:13.250
It's not about who has nuclear weapons and who doesn't.

134
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.500
The weapons themselves are the problem.

135
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:20.300
They aren't deeply immoral and an existential threat to all of us,

136
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.090
no matter what country you come from,

137
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.940
no matter what political side you find yourself on,

138
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.820
we need to demand that they disappear forever.

139
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.740
This will not happen without pressure. If you want to be part of this pressure,

140
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.840
there are things you personally can do to visit Notre nukes.org,

141
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.860
to learn more about nuclear weapons and what you can do about them.

142
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:54.340
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>
