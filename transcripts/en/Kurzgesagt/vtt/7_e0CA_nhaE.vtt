<v 0>Some groups just don't get along everyday.</v>

2
00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:08.310
Billions of soldiers fight a merciless war on thousands of fronts.

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.580
And it's been going on for over 100 million years.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.700
<v 1>The world war.</v>

6
00:00:32.181 --> 00:00:34.280
wide variety of ecological niches.

7
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.360
So successfully that they became one of the dominant animals on planet earth.

8
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.240
Today, they count more than 16,000 different species with over 10,000

9
00:00:44.241 --> 00:00:45.680
trillion individuals,

10
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.900
collectively ants alone make up 20% of the entire animal

11
00:00:50.901 --> 00:00:54.290
biomass on land. Similar to humans.

12
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.320
Their recipe for success is collaboration.

13
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.280
While a single plant is pretty useless together,

14
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.040
they are able to achieve stunning feats.

15
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.650
They construct complex colonies care for livestock, pursue agriculture,

16
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.240
or have complex symbiotic relationships. And of course,

17
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.380
and wage war, even among the same species,

18
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.580
a constant state of conflict is pretty common. Skirmishes,

19
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.120
raids and full on invasions are happening every day,

20
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.130
causing millions of casualties.

21
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.770
Let's look at some of the most interesting ones in a series of videos in

22
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.910
this one, the army and a swarm made for war.

23
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.010
The army and group consists of about 200 different species.

24
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.440
Army ants do not build nests.

25
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.210
They live a sort of nomadic lifestyle with groups of millions of individuals on

26
00:01:50.211 --> 00:01:53.900
a hunt, some species for large columns, up to 100 meters,

27
00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:58.700
long killing and immediately dismembering every insect or small vertebra they

28
00:01:58.701 --> 00:01:59.534
encounter.

29
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.360
The biggest hunting part is can kill up to 500,000 animals per day.

30
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.120
Some army ants specialize in hunting and consuming other social insects

31
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.830
like termites wasps,

32
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.450
and especially other ads wasps our fears and may seem

33
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.750
invulnerable. But if a swamp makes its way to their colonies,

34
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.730
they don't even stand a chance.

35
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.630
The much bigger and stronger wasps might kill a few of them,

36
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.550
but they are quickly overwhelmed.

37
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.140
Even if they're queen survives that attack the army ants steal the colonies

38
00:02:33.141 --> 00:02:37.370
larvae and quickly devoured them. There is no recovery from that.

39
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.410
When army ants discover another and colony, they immediately attack.

40
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.530
Now you might think this would be a more even battle,

41
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.030
but it's not because army ants act as a social unit.

42
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.970
They are especially dangerous and defective.

43
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.600
Most army ants are not particularly impressive individually,

44
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.240
but they can overwhelm their victims with sheer before the victim colony can

45
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:02.740
mountain effective defense.

46
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.140
And so invasions tend to be won by the attackers and the prey colony is damaged

47
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:10.360
significantly or is exterminated.

48
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.300
Interestingly army ants don't fight army ants. When two swarms in country,

49
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:18.970
each other in the wild, they either pass through each other,

50
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.510
ignoring the other swarm or both colonies just move away.

51
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.510
Which makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint,

52
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.670
army ants that fought other army ants probably eradicated themselves millions of

53
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:32.560
years ago. Indeed.

54
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:37.120
They're so deadly that other ant species had to specialize to survive their

55
00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:41.290
presence. Many species, just panic and evacuate their nest.

56
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:45.460
When they notice army and Scouts carrying as many larvae with them as they can

57
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.670
in order to return and rebuild. After the attack,

58
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.040
other species have invented living bunkers since fighting is so futile.

59
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.380
They have worker classes that have big square heads. When army ants show up,

60
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.200
they use them to block the entrances to their nests.

61
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.630
So the attackers have to give up after a while,

62
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.690
but not everybody is afraid of army ants,

63
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.820
leaf cutter ants form some of the largest and most complex societies of any

64
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:16.840
animal. Other than humans. They live in extensiveness,

65
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.130
many meters deep and across harboring millions of citizens with a highly

66
00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:24.970
sophisticated division of labor, like huge soldiers,

67
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.460
100 times more massive than a worker,

68
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.410
their sole purpose might be to defend their colonies against army ads.

69
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.660
They still have a nemesis though. The diet of the army and species,

70
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.010
no murmur mix. As in Becky,

71
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:43.930
I consists mostly of the larvae of the other ants compared to other army ants.

72
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.740
They have a more robust soldier cast so far.

73
00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:51.880
They are the only known species that can successfully attack a mature colony of

74
00:04:51.881 --> 00:04:55.420
leaf cutters. When they find a leaf cutter colony,

75
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.030
hundreds of thousands attack in a long column,

76
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.960
the moment the leaf cutter ants notice the army and attack.

77
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.460
They go into crisis mode and immediately alert their soldiers who very quickly

78
00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:07.930
swarmed the site of attack.

79
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.610
A frontline develops that can be a few meters wide and up to a meter deep,

80
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.890
the leaf cutter soldiers go head to head with the army and look in on them and

81
00:05:17.891 --> 00:05:19.360
try to cut through their heads.

82
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.930
Smaller leaf cutter workers help by grabbing the enemies.

83
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.080
Small teams carry out attacks behind the frontline,

84
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.380
where they dismember there and amazed by ripping their legs from their bodies.

85
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.690
The attackers, meanwhile,

86
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.530
try to swarm their victim soldiers and sting them to death in a mob,

87
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.550
despite the powerful defense and the determined response,

88
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.430
the army ants are still superior in numbers.

89
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.550
So without knowing if the battle can be won,

90
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.650
the leaf cutters prepare for the worst workers rushed to create barricades and

91
00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:54.910
seal off as many entrances to their nest as possible to secure their brood.

92
00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.380
If the leaf cutters are not able to repel the invaders or at least barricade

93
00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:02.030
enough of their entrances in time,

94
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.690
the army ants swarm and asked overrunning all opposition,

95
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.090
they penetrate deep into the hidden chambers and steal tens of thousands of the

96
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:15.590
leaf cutters brew to eat them. Even if the leaf cutter colony survives,

97
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.120
this is a heavy blow regardless who's won the war

98
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.050
thousands,

99
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.820
lay slain on the battlefields when the army ants attack death follows

100
00:06:25.821 --> 00:06:30.110
them, but there are other species that form much more dangerous.

101
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.760
And Thomas species that form super colonies covering thousands of square

102
00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:36.800
kilometers over multiple continents,

103
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.960
engaging in Wars kilometers across they deserve their own video though.

104
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.760
No matter the scale war is a part of ant existence.

105
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.320
Be it between huge colonies or small groups trying to fend off a rate

106
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.550
in tropical rainforests, but also in the cracks of the concrete.

107
00:06:55.551 --> 00:06:56.900
We walk over every day.

108
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.060
Humans have decided that war is not a thing that they want to do a lot anymore

109
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.710
for ants though. The other end will always be the enemy.
