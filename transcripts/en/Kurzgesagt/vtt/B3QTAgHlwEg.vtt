00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.090
<v 0>Deep in tropical jungles life floating kingdoms ruled by beautiful and</v>

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.320
deadly masters. They're sort of the high elves of the ant kingdoms,

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.760
talented architects, the create castles and city States,

4
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.750
but they are also fierce and expansionist warriors.

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.130
And that kingdoms are ensnared in a never ending war for survival.

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.500
It Koffler Weaver ads.

7
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.593
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

8
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.670
<v 0>Oh, it Koffler weavers walk on long legs have slender bodies and large eyes,</v>

9
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.320
which make them look pretty cute.

10
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.780
Although they're strong mandibles and the ability to shoot acid also make them

11
00:00:44.781 --> 00:00:45.800
pretty good at Kenning.

12
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.260
But more on that later that colonies usually have two to three

13
00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:55.910
worker classes that vary dramatically in size majors, minors,

14
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.030
and sometimes even tiny minim workers,

15
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.970
depending on location and species.

16
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.740
They vary in color from dark Brown to Emerald grain other than their

17
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:07.603
fancy Lokes.

18
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.020
What makes weavers special is that they're in the kingdom building business.

19
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.310
They like to build at pretty much all Heights, starting in shrubs,

20
00:01:16.311 --> 00:01:20.300
a few centerpieces above the ground and up to 10 meters in the tree canopy,

21
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.350
but they're not satisfied with ruling. Just one plot.

22
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.390
We've weavers we'll look for twigs,

23
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.860
all the honors that bridge the gap to other trees and expand to every plant.

24
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.170
They can reach this way.

25
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.070
Codon is spread upwards and sideways through the tree tops,

26
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.410
the largest Weaver and kingdoms.

27
00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:43.760
We know of occupy up to 1,600 square meters

28
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.950
around four basketball courts,

29
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.410
a lot of ground to cover for tiny ants and impossibly hard to control.

30
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.870
So we've ants construct dozens of nests scattered all over their territory,

31
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.870
outposts to defend the kingdom tubes or balls made from leaves and ghostly silk

32
00:02:02.871 --> 00:02:03.704
sheets.

33
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.810
These masterpieces of and architecture are created by the Weaver

34
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.610
majors, the larger worker ants,

35
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.440
which are responsible for the more dangerous jobs like fighting foraging and

36
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.470
nest construction. To start a new nest,

37
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.340
a major tries to band different leaves in her surroundings into a tube.

38
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.740
If one of the leaves is flexible enough,

39
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.450
more workers will arrive to help chains of workers pull the Leaf's edges

40
00:02:29.451 --> 00:02:30.284
together,

41
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.460
or reach across gaps and grab distant leaves to add them to the construction

42
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.490
while the bending and pulling is going on.

43
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.390
Other workers carry larvae from the closest nest to the construction site.

44
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.190
Usually ant larvae spend themselves a cocoon to protect themselves,

45
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.380
but the and larvae give all of their soak to the colony as building material.

46
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.980
So when the workers tapped the love, his heads on the leaf,

47
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.770
they released their sticky thread like tiny, cute glue guns, this way,

48
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.120
the workers, so the bent leaf onto itself. So it won't unfold anymore.

49
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.790
This creates a central chamber that's used as the basis for up to 300 more

50
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:12.730
leaves that are wound around it together.

51
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.650
They form little pockets and act as additional rooms for the new outpost to

52
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:19.030
make it even more cozy.

53
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.430
Miner workers use the larvae to weave additional floors and chambers nests are

54
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:28.570
usually constructed as barracks on the territory's borders or a storage for

55
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.180
brood and food supplies. This way,

56
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.510
the ants don't need to cross vast distances to the headquarters,

57
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.250
but have soldiers close to any potential point of conflict apart from one

58
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:41.140
special nest in the middle of the network,

59
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.380
which is reserved for the queen and her guards here,

60
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.360
she produces hundreds of eggs a day,

61
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.600
which get transferred to suitable nests with brood chambers.

62
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.210
So a colony is a network of little castles and moats connected by suspension.

63
00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:56.610
Bridges made from leaves,

64
00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.680
the honors and Twix and establish colony easily has half a

65
00:04:01.681 --> 00:04:05.490
million individuals that need to be fed. Fortunately,

66
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.690
we've answered evolve to have very close and beneficial relationships with their

67
00:04:09.691 --> 00:04:11.550
hosts, shrubs and trees.

68
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.530
The tree gives the answer home and access to sweet SAP to drink,

69
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.600
but maybe even more importantly,

70
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.830
it allows them to cultivate cattle like aphids or caterpillars that produce

71
00:04:22.831 --> 00:04:25.950
honeydew for them. This would usually hurt a tree,

72
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.570
but these insects belong to a small group of VIP's only a few

73
00:04:30.571 --> 00:04:34.380
selected neighbors and the aunt's cattle are allowed on the fruit tree,

74
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.600
many other insects and even larger herbivores or scat off or even

75
00:04:39.601 --> 00:04:42.780
killed and eaten. So most cases,

76
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.430
the tree only has to tolerate acceptable levels of damage while being protected

77
00:04:47.431 --> 00:04:48.840
from more dangerous pasts,

78
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.510
the Weaver ant kingdom could be an ant paradise. If there wasn't competition,

79
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.830
mostly from other kingdoms, slink, medieval humans,

80
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.750
every queen seeks to conquer others and make their land. Their own controlling.

81
00:05:03.751 --> 00:05:06.690
Fertile land is the key to survive in the jungle.

82
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.060
And if a kingdom loses too much of,

83
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.390
as it shrinks and is overrun or starves to death,

84
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.000
so expanding and defending their borders is critical to keep the colony alive.

85
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.550
When a kingdom invades another,

86
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:25.050
it first gathered an army of a few thousand majors who make their way towards

87
00:05:25.051 --> 00:05:26.160
the opposing colony.

88
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.230
The goal is to steal a bit of territory and take it over defending weave

89
00:05:31.231 --> 00:05:35.880
patrols, quickly, spot the invaders and immediately release an alarm pheromone,

90
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.830
some rush to the front,

91
00:05:37.831 --> 00:05:42.000
to defend while others rushed to the closest outposts for help marking their

92
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.450
route with pheromones. Whenever they meet other sisters,

93
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.270
they jerked their bodies as if in a fight to signal them,

94
00:05:48.271 --> 00:05:52.770
to follow the pheromone trail to the frontline at the site of battle

95
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.260
majors from both parties, raise their bodies,

96
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.750
circle each other with mandibles open and try to seize their opponents.

97
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.120
If an ant gets a hold of her opponent,

98
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.080
the victim is pulled into a group of allied majors and pinned down

99
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.080
the ants. Then rip the victim apart,

100
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.310
clipping off antennae and legs and slicing open thereafter modes

101
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.160
to slow down the advance of the attackers.

102
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.840
The defending majors squirt formic acid over the battlefield to chemically Berg,

103
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.913
their targets.

104
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.260
This is soon answered in the same way by the attackers in the chaotic battle.

105
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.550
Both parties lose countless fighters on the increasingly acidic battlefield.

106
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.620
After a few minutes,

107
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.940
the backup from the outposts arrive in the time window for a successful attack,

108
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:38.990
slowly closes.

109
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.430
This is when the battle turns the defenders slowly.

110
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.190
Push-back the attack party. In the end,

111
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.630
the attackers can't keep up and have to retreat for both parties.

112
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.460
It was a costly battle.

113
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.720
Thousands of corpses lie piled up on the ground under the battlefield,

114
00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.130
and many ants are severely injured. The defending colonies,

115
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:03.350
nests and bruise are safe though.

116
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.810
The attacker's attempt to steal new valuable territory has failed for today.

117
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:10.790
They'll try again soon,

118
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.160
but the kingdom will be ready for the high ants of the floating

119
00:07:16.161 --> 00:07:18.320
kingdoms. War is nothing special.

120
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.590
It's just a fact of life because as we know,

121
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.480
empires never ever have enough and the Weaver ants are ready to

122
00:07:26.481 --> 00:07:27.314
fight.

123
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:32.600
This video is part three of a series that was developed with the support of

124
00:07:32.601 --> 00:07:33.590
curiosity stream,

125
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.910
