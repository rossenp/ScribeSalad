00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.210
<v 0>Every living being needs to fight off other living beings that want to feast on</v>

2
00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:10.560
them. So as a multicellular life evolved over billions of years,

3
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.770
it came out with ways to defend itself. Today,

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.790
humans have a sophisticated defense network like physical barriers,

5
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.160
defense cells, and weapons factories.

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.650
But what are the most important defenses of our body is largely unknown.

7
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.630
The complement system. It evolved over 700 million years ago.

8
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.580
And as an army of over 30 different proteins that work together in a complex and

9
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.980
elegant dance to stop intruders all in all about 15 quintillion of them are

10
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:43.860
saturating every fluid in your body right now,

11
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.320
guided by nothing but chemistry.

12
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.430
These proteins are one of the most effective weapons we have against invaders.

13
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.200
Many other parts of the immune system are just tools to activate the complement

14
00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:57.780
system. But it's also really dangerous.

15
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.410
Imagine having trillions of little bombs inside your blood,

16
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.030
that could go off at any moment.

17
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.370
So our cells use numerous mechanisms to prevent compliments from accidentally

18
00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:12.030
attacking them. Okay, what exactly does it do?

19
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.860
And what makes it so dangerous?

20
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.000
In a nutshell, the complement system does three things. It cripples enemies.

21
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.410
It activates the immune system and it rips holes in things until they die.

22
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.080
But how after all these are mindless proteins randomly drifting around

23
00:01:39.081 --> 00:01:43.850
without where Lord direction? Well, this is actually part of the strategy.

24
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.630
Complement proteins float around in a sort of passive mode.

25
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.030
They do nothing until they get activated and change their shape in

26
00:01:53.031 --> 00:01:54.170
the world of proteins,

27
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.880
your shape determines what you can and cannot do because shape

28
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.470
determines what you can interact with. And in what way, for example,

29
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.880
in your passive shape, you might do nothing in your active shape. However,

30
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.030
you might, for example, change the shape of other proteins,

31
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.800
activating them so they can activate others mechanisms like this.

32
00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:19.190
One can start cascades that spread very quickly.

33
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.390
Imagine the compliment proteins as being like millions of matches,

34
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.340
very close together. Once one catches fire, it ignites the ones around it.

35
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.750
They ignite more and suddenly you have a big fire to show.

36
00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:37.010
The actual mechanisms of the complement system is a complicated and

37
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.410
overwhelming. So we'll simplify here.

38
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.550
Now let's imagine you cut yourself and a bunch of bacteria,

39
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.250
enter the wound and make it into the surrounding tissue.

40
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.230
Our compliment attack begins with C3. C3 is the first match.

41
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.550
The initial spark that will start our fire and to do that.

42
00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.310
C3 needs to switch from passive to active. How happens is complex,

43
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.900
but let's just say it can happen randomly through other complement proteins that

44
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:07.090
bind to enemies or through antibodies.

45
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.590
All you really need to know is that C3 breaks into two smaller proteins,

46
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.270
C3 and C3 B that are now activated. One of these parts.

47
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.350
The C3 B protein is like a Sicamous our specialized in bacteria,

48
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.970
funky and viruses. It has a fraction of a second to find a victim,

49
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.100
or it will be neutralized by water molecules. If C3 B does find a target,

50
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.680
it anchors itself very tightly to its surface.

51
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.390
And doesn't let go by doing soap. The protein changes its shape again,

52
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.800
and its new shape.

53
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.360
It's now able to grab other proteins and start a small cascade changing its

54
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:48.100
shape multiple times, adding other complement proteins to itself. Finally,

55
00:03:48.101 --> 00:03:52.810
it transforms itself into a recruiting platform known as C3 converters.

56
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.480
This platform is an expert at activating more C3 proteins that start the

57
00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:02.650
whole cycle. A new an amplification loop begins soon.

58
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.460
Thousands of proteins cover the bacteria for the bacteria.

59
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.870
This is very bad.

60
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.640
It can cripple the bacteria and make them helpless or slow them down.

61
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.610
Imagine being covered by thousands of flies.

62
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.500
But do you remember the other part of C3? The C3,

63
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.980
a protein C3 eight is like a distress beacon.

64
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.270
Thousands of them flood away from the site of battle screaming for attention.

65
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.370
Passive immune cells notice the C3 proteins and awakened from their slumber to

66
00:04:32.371 --> 00:04:34.650
follow the protein tracks to the site of infection,

67
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.230
the more alarm proteins they encounter, the more aggressive they get this way.

68
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.280
Compliment guides,

69
00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:45.720
reinforcements exactly to the place where they're needed the most. So far.

70
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.440
The compliment has slowed down the invaders and called for help.

71
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.040
Now it's beginning to actively help to kill the enemy.

72
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.300
The first immune cells to arrive at the battlefield are phagocytes,

73
00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.130
which means cells. That sweater,

74
00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:02.580
you hold trap you in a tiny prison and then kill you with acid,

75
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.180
but swallow an enemy. They need to grab it first,

76
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.500
which is not easy because bacteria prefer not to be grabbed and a sort of

77
00:05:10.501 --> 00:05:11.334
slippery.

78
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.900
But now the compliment that has anchored itself to the bacteria acts as a sort

79
00:05:15.901 --> 00:05:19.350
of glue that makes it easy for the immune cells to catch their victims,

80
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.100
but it gets even better. Imagine being covered in flies again.

81
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.310
Now imagine them turning into wasps.

82
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.080
Another case is about to begin on the surface of the bacteria.

83
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.900
The C3 recruitment platform changes its shape again,

84
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.930
and begins to recruit new proteins together.

85
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.210
They begin the construction of a bigger structure,

86
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.440
a membrane attack complex piece by piece,

87
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.940
new proteins shaped like long Spears,

88
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.290
anchor themselves deep into the bacterias membranes until they rip a hole into

89
00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:50.910
them. That can't be closed again.

90
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.720
Fluids rush into the bacteria and their insides spill out.

91
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.520
They bleed to death.

92
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.820
The remaining bacteria are maimed and distracted by the compliment and quickly

93
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:04.190
taken care of by the arriving immune cells.

94
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.690
The invasion has been nipped in the bud before it had the opportunity to become

95
00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:11.540
dangerous. You probably didn't even notice it,

96
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.950
but while bacteria are not happy about compliment the enemies,

97
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.370
it might be the most useful against are actually viruses.

98
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.650
Viruses have one problem.

99
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.220
They need to travel from cell to cell outside of cells.

100
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.150
They're basically hoping to randomly bump against a cell to infect by pure

101
00:06:29.151 --> 00:06:29.984
chance.

102
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.610
Here they're completely defenseless and here compliment is able to

103
00:06:34.611 --> 00:06:36.080
intercept and cripple them.

104
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.000
So they become harmless and guide the immune system to disavow them without

105
00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:45.320
compliment virus infections would be a lot more deadly, but wait,

106
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.740
if we have such an effective weapon, why do we have to get sick?

107
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.390
The problem is that in a war, both sides adapt. For example,

108
00:06:53.391 --> 00:06:55.340
when the vaccine virus infects a cell,

109
00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:00.290
it forces it to produce a protein that shuts compliment activation down this

110
00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:04.070
way. The virus creates safe zones around the cells that in fact,

111
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.710
when it kills them and tries to infect more,

112
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.600
it has a higher chance of being successful. Or some bacteria, for example,

113
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.290
can grab certain molecules from the blood that keep the complement system calm

114
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.890
and make themselves invisible. So the complement system,

115
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.840
while being extremely important is only one player in the complex and beautiful

116
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:26.060
organization. That is our immune system,

117
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:31.310
a beautiful example of how many mindless things can do smart things

118
00:07:31.311 --> 00:07:32.144
together.

119
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:39.080
This video was sponsored by you without your direct

120
00:07:39.081 --> 00:07:41.390
support. This channel would not exist.

121
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.710
And it's hard to overstate how grateful we are for that in 2019,

122
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.390
an average quotes cause Kazak video took at least 1,200 hours to produce.

123
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.480
We need months to research and write our scripts,

124
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:58.190
clear them with experts in Australia and animate every scene from scratch and to

125
00:07:58.191 --> 00:07:59.630
compose original music.

126
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.440
This is only possible through a combination of sponsorships,

127
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:08.270
your support on Patrion and selling merge like this poster and postcards we made

128
00:08:08.271 --> 00:08:11.840
about the compliment system. If you yourself want to support us,

129
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:16.520
you can do so by watching, becoming a Patrion and maybe getting a personal bird,
