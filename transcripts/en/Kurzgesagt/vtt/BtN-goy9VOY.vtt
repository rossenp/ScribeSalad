00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.740
<v 0>In December, 2019,</v>

2
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.460
the Chinese authorities notified the world that the virus was spreading through

3
00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:07.680
their communities. In the following months,

4
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.890
it spread to other countries with cases doubling within days,

5
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.260
this virus is the severe acute respiratory syndrome related Corona virus to

6
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.690
the causes, the disease called COVID 19.

7
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.240
And that everyone simply calls Corona virus.

8
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.110
What actually happens when it infects a human and what should we do?

9
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.200
This is really just a Hull around genetic material and a few proteins,

10
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.180
arguably not even a living thing.

11
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.660
It can only make more of itself by entering a living cell.

12
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.270
Corona may spread via surfaces,

13
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.760
but it's still uncertain how long it can survive on them.

14
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.620
Its main way of spreading seems to be droplet infection when people cough or if

15
00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:58.730
you touch someone who's ill and then you'll face say rubbing your eyes or nose,

16
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.440
the virus starts its journey here. And then hitches a ride as a stairway,

17
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.280
deeper into the body. It's destinations are the intestines,

18
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.730
the spleen or the lungs where it can have the most dramatic effect.

19
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.410
Even just a few Corona viruses can cause quite a dramatic situation.

20
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.190
The lungs are lined with billions of epithelial cells.

21
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.320
These are the border cells of your body lining your organs and mucosa waiting to

22
00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:25.040
be. In fact,

23
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.930
it Corona connects to a specific receptor on its victims membranes to inject

24
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.620
its genetic material. The cell ignorant of what's happening,

25
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.300
executes the new instructions, which are pretty simple copy and reassemble.

26
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.860
It fills up with more and more copies of the original virus until it reaches a

27
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.500
critical point and receives one final order.

28
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.350
Self-destruct the cell sort of melts away releasing new Corona particles,

29
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.210
ready to attack more cells.

30
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.490
The number of infected cells grows exponentially. After about 10 days,

31
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.350
millions of body cells are infected and billions of viruses swarm the lungs.

32
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.590
The virus has not caused too much damage yet,

33
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.300
but Corona is now going to release a real beast on you, your own immune system,

34
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.040
the immune system,

35
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.970
while there to protect you can actually be pretty dangerous to yourself and

36
00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:18.260
needs tight regulation.

37
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.510
And as immune cells pour into the lungs to fight the virus, Corona infects,

38
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.430
some of them and creates confusion. Cells have neither ears nor eyes.

39
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.750
They communicate mostly via tiny information proteins called cytokines.

40
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.960
Nearly every important immune reaction is controlled by them.

41
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.000
Corona causes infected immune cells to overreact and yell bloody murder.

42
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.020
In a sense,

43
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.310
it puts the immune system into a fighting frenzy and sends way more soldiers

44
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:50.930
than it should wasting its resources and causing damage to kinds of

45
00:02:50.931 --> 00:02:55.070
cells in particular wreak havoc, first neutral files,

46
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.690
which are great at killing stuff,

47
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.370
including ourselves as they arrive in their thousands.

48
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.360
They start pumping out enzymes that destroy as many friends as enemies.

49
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.280
The other important type of cells that go into a frenzy, Oh killer T cells,

50
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.700
which usually order infected cells to commit controlled suicide,

51
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.770
confused as they are.

52
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.600
They start ordering healthy cells to kill themselves to the more and more immune

53
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:20.434
cells arrive.

54
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.890
The more damage they do and the more healthy lung tissue they kill.

55
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.020
This might get so bad that it can cause permanent irreversible damage that leads

56
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:32.170
to lifelong disabilities. In most cases,

57
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.570
the immune system slowly regains control. It kills the infected cells,

58
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.800
intercepts the viruses, trying to infect new ones and cleans up the battlefield.

59
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.030
Recovery begins the majority. If people in fact it by Corona,

60
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.580
we'll get through it with relatively mild symptoms,

61
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.450
but many cases become severe or even critical.

62
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.200
We don't know the percentage because not all cases have been identified,

63
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.080
but it's safe to say that there is a lot more than with the flu.

64
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.120
In most severe cases, millions of epithelial cells have died. And with them,

65
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.100
the lungs protective lining has gone.

66
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.140
That means that the alveoli tiny ASACs via which breathing occurs can be

67
00:04:10.141 --> 00:04:13.350
infected by bacteria. That aren't usually a big problem.

68
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.240
Patients get pneumonia,

69
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.890
respiration becomes hard or even fails and patients need ventilators to

70
00:04:19.891 --> 00:04:20.724
survive.

71
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.260
The immune system has fought at full capacity for weeks and made millions of

72
00:04:25.261 --> 00:04:29.520
antiviral weapons. And as thousands of bacteria rapidly multiply,

73
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.600
it is overwhelmed. They enter the blood and overrun the body.

74
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.390
If this happens, death is very likely.

75
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.690
Corona virus is often compared to the flu,

76
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.580
but actually it's much more dangerous while the exact staff rate is hard to pin

77
00:04:44.581 --> 00:04:46.440
down during an ongoing pandemic.

78
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.030
We know for sure that it's much more contagious and spreads faster than the flu.

79
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.520
There are two futures for a pandemic like Corona fast and slow,

80
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.270
which future we will see depends on how we all react to it.

81
00:05:00.271 --> 00:05:02.070
In the early days of the outbreak,

82
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.270
a first pandemic will be horrible and cost many lives.

83
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.780
A slow pandemic will not be remembered by the history books.

84
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.700
The worst case scenario for a fast pandemic begins with a very rapid rate of

85
00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:18.240
infection because there are no countermeasures in place to slow it down.

86
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.810
Why is there so bad in a fast pandemic?

87
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.070
Many people get sick at the same time. If the numbers get too large,

88
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.560
healthcare systems become unable to handle it.

89
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.940
There aren't enough resources like medical staff or equipment like ventilators

90
00:05:32.941 --> 00:05:36.180
left to help everybody. People will die untreated.

91
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.390
And as more healthcare workers get sick themselves,

92
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.510
the capacity of healthcare systems falls even further.

93
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:44.880
If this becomes the case,

94
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.480
then horrible decisions will have to be made about who gets to live and who

95
00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:49.314
doesn't.

96
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.390
The number of deaths rises significantly in such a scenario to

97
00:05:54.391 --> 00:05:55.860
avoid this the world.

98
00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.800
That means all us needs to do what it can to turn this into a slow pandemic.

99
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.610
A pandemic is slowed down by the right responses,

100
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.840
especially in the early phase so that everyone who gets sick can get treatment.

101
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.780
And there's no crunch point with overwhelmed hospitals.

102
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.750
Since we don't have a vaccine for Corona,

103
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.700
we have to socially engineer our behavior to act like a social vaccine.

104
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.950
This simply means two things,

105
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.240
no guessing infected and not infecting others.

106
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:27.920
Although it sounds trivial.

107
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.680
The very best thing you can do is to wash your hands.

108
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.470
Soap is actually a powerful tool.

109
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:38.570
The Corona virus is encased in what is basically a layer of fast soap breaks

110
00:06:38.571 --> 00:06:41.600
that fat apart and leaves it unable to infect you.

111
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.790
It also makes your hands slippery.

112
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.740
And with the mechanical motions of washing viruses are ripped away to do it

113
00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:49.340
properly.

114
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.360
Wash your hands as if you've just cut up some jalapenos and want to put in your

115
00:06:53.361 --> 00:06:57.590
contacts. Next, the next thing is social distancing,

116
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.540
which is not a nice experience, but a nice thing to do. This means no hugging,

117
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.270
no handshakes. If you can stay at home,

118
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:09.830
stay at home to protect those who need to be out for society to function from

119
00:07:09.831 --> 00:07:14.060
doctors to cashiers, all police officers, you depend on all of them.

120
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.710
They all depend on you to not get sick on a larger level.

121
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:19.820
There are quarantines,

122
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.660
which can be different things from travel restrictions or actual orders to stay

123
00:07:23.661 --> 00:07:28.160
at home. Quarantines are not great to experience and certainly not popular,

124
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.450
but they buy us.

125
00:07:29.451 --> 00:07:33.530
And especially the researchers working on medication and vaccination crucial

126
00:07:33.531 --> 00:07:36.260
time. So if you are put under quarantine,

127
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:40.910
you should understand why and respect is. None of this is fun,

128
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.040
but looking at the big picture,

129
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.990
it is a really small price to pay the question of how pandemics and

130
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.100
depends on how they start. If they start fast with a steep slope,

131
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:56.450
they end badly. If they start slow with a not so steep slope,

132
00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.510
the end okay-ish and in this day and age,

133
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.000
it really is in all of our hands,

134
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:04.820
literally and figuratively.

135
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.650
A huge thanks to the experts who helped us on short notice with this video,

136
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:11.660
especially our world in data,

137
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.770
the online publication for research and data on the world's largest problems and

138
00:08:15.771 --> 00:08:18.620
how to make progress, solving them, check out their site.

139
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:23.210
It also includes a constantly updated page on the Corona pandemic.

140
00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:32.980
