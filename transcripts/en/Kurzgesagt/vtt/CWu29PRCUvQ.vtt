00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.870
<v 0>Imagine someone coming into your kitchen and taking a few tools,</v>

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.710
a pan and your garbage, then they bury everything in the woods.

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.630
12,000 years later, an archeologist is trying to figure out who you were,

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.080
what was important to you, what video games you played,

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.940
what you believed in and what informed your decisions because you happened to

6
00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:23.970
live during a remarkable time in human history.

7
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.340
The Planetree revolution,

8
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.900
when the humanity transitioned becoming a multi-planetary species

9
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.790
in that time, our numbers would explode by orders of magnitude.

10
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.540
Our technology and standard of living would improve to levels.

11
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.250
Previously thought impossible, and our self-conception would change forever.

12
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.800
And all the future archeologists has to learn about is your junk in the woods.

13
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.110
While we can only hope that this will be someone's problem. In 12,000 years,

14
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.120
we have the same problem today.

15
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.430
We're trying to reconstruct a revolution that took place 12,000 years ago.

16
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.620
Today only shadows remain of the people who experienced our distant

17
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.270
past as they're present,

18
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.810
what remains from our past.

19
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.400
We can look at our present in crispy 4k,

20
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.300
in color and sound three generations ago,

21
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.140
the world was just black and white, one more generation.

22
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.570
And we see the world through blurred photographs,

23
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.000
further back paintings and texts become our main way of experiencing the

24
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:36.750
past Amir 20 generations before us today,

25
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.760
every written word had to be copied by hand and reports became more scarce and

26
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:42.600
less reliable.

27
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.300
The first historian lived Amir 100 generations ago before

28
00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:48.870
him.

29
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.490
There are only epics and legends and dead Kings bracking on pieces of

30
00:01:53.491 --> 00:01:56.910
stone, 250 generations ago.

31
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.500
There are only fragments left in the ground and images stripped to their

32
00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:02.340
original meaning.

33
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.710
Eventually humanity becomes basically invisible. Still.

34
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.170
We do know some things about our ancestors.

35
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.430
Let's try to tell their story and what it means for us today.

36
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.760
The greatest transition in human history for some 2 million

37
00:02:20.761 --> 00:02:23.310
years or roughly 80,000 generations,

38
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.040
the life of our ancestors was basically the same.

39
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.260
It was around 20,000 years or 800 generations ago that the behaviorally

40
00:02:31.261 --> 00:02:34.860
modern humans began a process that would change our lifestyle forever.

41
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.610
At first, gradually for some of us then faster for more of us,

42
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.950
and then suddenly for almost all of us back then there were

43
00:02:45.951 --> 00:02:48.290
about 1 million modern humans on earth.

44
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.700
Most other human species had died out probably with a little help from us.

45
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.780
Our ancestors biology had given them the necessary tools,

46
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.060
a general intelligence to understand things as social intelligence,

47
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:03.250
to understand each other and language,

48
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:06.670
to express abstract ideas and create new concepts.

49
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.670
These were people just like you.

50
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.130
They suffered and experienced joy were bored, cried, and laughed.

51
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.400
They lived in communities of a few dozen people.

52
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.590
They controlled fire and had tools made from wood stone and bone

53
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.550
told stories, born bad dad and created art.

54
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.380
They traded with other tribes from obsidian to shellfish,

55
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.900
some hunted big game and were very mobile. Others relied more on plants.

56
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:41.830
They collected and others mostly stayed in one area with an abundance of

57
00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:42.664
seafood.

58
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.250
This was the common state of humanity for most of our history until a slow

59
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:52.120
transition. Step-by-step turned into a revolution

60
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.690
step by step.

61
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.910
The first solid evidence for this stems from the Jordan Valley,

62
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.990
where our ancestors collected wild wheat, more than 20,000 years ago,

63
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.130
they noticed that seeds in the ground made more plants the next year.

64
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.190
If they put good ones in one place the next year,

65
00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:13.690
they had more of the good ones.

66
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.170
This was a great supplement to hunting and gathering.

67
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.410
You could prepare some crops return next year,

68
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:23.650
build a temporary settlement and have a secure food supply.

69
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.230
Our ancestors used these bonus trumps to bake the first bread and brew the first

70
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.420
beer with every generation.

71
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.470
They gathered deeper knowledge about the plants and animals around them and how

72
00:04:35.471 --> 00:04:37.450
to manipulate them to their advantage.

73
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.970
But there was a lot to learn very slowly from generation to generation

74
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.140
pockets of knowledge expanded and were passed along to be expanded. Again,

75
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.400
this early agriculture started to drastically reduce the space.

76
00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:53.950
Our ancestors needed to feed one individual,

77
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.290
which made it possible to stay in one place longer around 12,000 years

78
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:02.560
ago, these little pieces of progress had reached a critical mass.

79
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.080
Most of the calories we consume today STEM from about 15 different founder crops

80
00:05:08.081 --> 00:05:11.980
that humans began to domesticate in earnest in the next few thousand years,

81
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.870
what we call the agricultural revolution was not a thing that began suddenly.

82
00:05:16.871 --> 00:05:21.100
One day it was a slow process driven by small groups over many

83
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:21.934
generations.

84
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.800
Eventually gradual change gave rise to a new era.

85
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.160
This human error during the next few thousand years,

86
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.120
progress would speed up and turn Hunter gatherers into farmers who lived in

87
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.130
villages, towns, and then cities. When farmers moved into new areas,

88
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.880
they replaced the nomadic tribes or turn them into farmers too.

89
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.500
This was neither easy nor painless. In the early days,

90
00:05:50.501 --> 00:05:55.360
people had a diverse diet made up of up to 250 different plants and animals

91
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.670
for some of the transitioning to agriculture,

92
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.530
the variation in their diets declined drastically and some even seem to have

93
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:06.710
been under nourished and living close together.

94
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.100
And with animals created a breeding ground for disease.

95
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.470
Virtually every infectious disease caused by micro organisms that have adapted

96
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:20.150
to humans arose in the last 10,000 years, cholera smallpox,

97
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.770
measles, influenza chicken box and malaria mortality,

98
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.350
especially among children, Rose drastically,

99
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.600
still loud numbers grew because living in the same place enabled women to bear

100
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:35.210
far more children than before. And for a farmer,

101
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.210
more kids mean more hands to work. The fields,

102
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.430
even with more people dying,

103
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:44.860
younger villages and towns grew the number of humans earth

104
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.550
exploded about 100 generations.

105
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.540
After the beginning of the human era, there were already 4 million of us.

106
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.640
This increased the need for food and people to come up with evermore efficient

107
00:06:57.641 --> 00:07:01.360
ways of producing canneries, solidifying our new life style,

108
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.400
going back to hunting and gathering would have just meant death by starvation.

109
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.630
For most one question remains unanswered. Why,

110
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:15.850
why would we'll exchange the freedom of living off nature with a huge variety in

111
00:07:15.851 --> 00:07:20.020
food for the grind of agriculture and often more limited diets?

112
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.790
Nobody knows for sure.

113
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.420
Climate change seems to have made the transition possible.

114
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.500
And some scientists argue that it was caused by external factors like under

115
00:07:29.501 --> 00:07:31.390
nourishment or overpopulation,

116
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:34.750
both highly contested today.

117
00:07:34.751 --> 00:07:39.280
The most widely accepted idea is that it was a deliberate choice made by

118
00:07:39.281 --> 00:07:41.440
countless communities around the globe.

119
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.040
Maybe it's also connected with what makes us human,

120
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.170
the ability to come together,

121
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.310
develop shared identities and exchange stories and knowledge.

122
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:56.200
Some archeologists think that groups of hunter-gatherers traveled long and far

123
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.840
to celebrate to hold feasts and rituals.

124
00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:03.520
They would have used these occasions to talk about their version of innovation,

125
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.170
better hunting and toolmaking techniques how to catch and read animals and which

126
00:08:08.171 --> 00:08:12.700
plants could be collected and multiplied. Maybe they even exchanged seeds.

127
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.200
It's not unlikely that these gatherings were the catalyst that spread the

128
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.590
knowledge of agriculture through the many isolated groups of humanity,

129
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:25.210
ultimately ending a lifestyle that was common to our species for thousands of

130
00:08:25.211 --> 00:08:29.980
generations. So by being able to come together, celebrate, share,

131
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.480
and learn from one another.

132
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.440
These humans might've taken the steps that led to our modern world.

133
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.780
And we have much to be grateful for.

134
00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:43.210
We are still the same humans today, even if it often doesn't feel that way,

135
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:48.010
maybe it's time to come together to share what we know and celebrate our

136
00:08:48.011 --> 00:08:51.820
existence. Once again, to begin another peaceful transition,

137
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:56.160
maybe the planetary revolution that will change once more.

138
00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.150
So hopefully in another 12,000 years,

139
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.990
our descendants will look back on us today with gratitude,

140
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.530
for the amazing world. They are able to inhabit

141
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.050
to celebrate the achievements of our ancestors in the last 12,000 years.

142
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.450
And to look with hope towards the next 12,000.

143
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:20.310
We present you with the fifth human error calendar for the year 12,021.

144
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:22.350
<v 1>This time.</v>

145
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.510
<v 0>It's all about the journey of humanity.</v>

146
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.990
Beginning tens of thousands of years ago,

147
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:32.850
leading into the revolution of agriculture to ancient high civilizations

148
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.380
and the beginning of modern times culminating in a vision for our future.

149
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:42.600
You can get the limited edition now until we set out and then never again,

150
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:47.040
as always the calendar features 12 illustrated pages printed on high quality

151
00:09:47.041 --> 00:09:51.900
paper in Europe and the U S and this year, the cover is especially shiny.

152
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:56.580
Not only does the calendar look great on walls and makes it easier to dream

153
00:09:56.581 --> 00:10:00.420
about a glorious future and realize how far we've come as a species.

154
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.570
It's also the best way to support cods Cozart.

155
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:08.370
The calendar enables us to put in the timeout videos need and release them for

156
00:10:08.371 --> 00:10:11.070
free for everyone. If you want,

157
00:10:11.071 --> 00:10:14.550
you can get the Canada with a hoodie or infographic posters or plushy.

158
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:15.900
We've met a few deals for you.

159
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.060
Thank you so much to the thousands of people who get the calendar every year and

160
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.700
to the burbs who love what we try to do on this channel.

161
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.050
We wish you a happy year, 12,021,

162
00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:31.860
and let's all hope that it will be less exciting than 12,020.
