<v 0>In and out in and out.</v>

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.640
<v 1>Staying alive is about doing things this very second,</v>

3
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.410
your cells are combusting glucose molecules with oxygen to make energy

4
00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:16.160
available,

5
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.080
which keeps you alive for another precious moment to get the oxygen

6
00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:22.880
to your cells. You'll breathing.

7
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.780
Breathing is an answer to a very hard problem.

8
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.000
How do you get the resources that your cells need to survive from the outside

9
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.070
to the inside of your cells? Every living thing has to solve this problem.

10
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.930
And the solution is surprisingly different depending on one of the most

11
00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:44.870
important regulators of life size,

12
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.530
as we've discussed in other videos of different scales,

13
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.040
the physical laws of the universe have different consequences for its

14
00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:56.060
inhabitants. Simple things like temperature, micro gravity,

15
00:00:56.061 --> 00:00:59.930
or surface tension might not matter to you or be a deadly danger,

16
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.810
depending on how big you are. Living.

17
00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:06.920
Things need a lot of different materials to keep themselves going and they

18
00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:10.430
somehow need to transport them from the outside to the inside.

19
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.020
This was a huge problem for the first things on the verge of being alive,

20
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.470
because doing anything in our universe requires energy.

21
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.390
And the first living beings on earth did not have the abundance of tools and

22
00:01:23.391 --> 00:01:28.100
techniques available that life has today after billions of years of evolution.

23
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.290
So at the very beginning life needed to find a way to get good stuff

24
00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:37.400
inside and bad stuff outside of itself without using energy.

25
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.060
Luckily, the very first forms of life were very,

26
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.450
very small and because they were so small,

27
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.390
they were able to use a free form of transport.

28
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.840
That was based on a physical law called diffusion.

29
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.190
Diffusion is the rule of the universe that molecules,

30
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.720
especially in liquids or gases are constantly moving around in all

31
00:01:59.721 --> 00:02:00.554
directions.

32
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.060
And because they move around and bump into each other and other molecules,

33
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.890
they tend to spread. For example, if you drop a sugar cube into water,

34
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.410
then there is a lot of sugar in one place.

35
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.510
And in another place there's none as sugar molecules dissolve in the

36
00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:18.110
water.

37
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.040
They will start randomly bumping against the water molecules and other sugar

38
00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:23.870
molecules slowly,

39
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.460
all the sugar molecules will spread out and form multiple phases of different

40
00:02:28.461 --> 00:02:29.420
concentrations.

41
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.270
These random movements continue endlessly until at some point the sugar will be

42
00:02:35.271 --> 00:02:36.950
spread evenly in the water.

43
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.570
The great thing about diffusion is that life can use it for free.

44
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.370
It doesn't require energy and life loves free things.

45
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.880
So all life on earth relies on diffusion.

46
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.690
Let's look at the smallest living, being on earth,

47
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.760
a bacterium specifically its surfaces cell

48
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.750
membranes allow for diffusion of certain molecules.

49
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.330
This specific bacterium consumes oxygen to live while carbon dioxide is

50
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:11.710
produced inside as a waste product. So inside the bacterium,

51
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.420
there isn't a lot of oxygen,

52
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.710
but a lot of carbon dioxide because of diffusion,

53
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.440
these molecules will eventually spread evenly.

54
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.630
So the carbon dioxide diffuses out while oxygen is constantly replenished

55
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:26.590
from the outside,

56
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.990
but this kind of breathing only works for the very small world for

57
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:36.400
bacteria or amoeba or your cells, and a few very small animals.

58
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.440
Insects, for example,

59
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:42.970
have a fine network of trickier tunnels with a pressure gradient where AV very

60
00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:46.870
slowly can diffuse in and exchange gases with the insect cells.

61
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.030
But even insects seem to be able to contract that truck here. And at least some,

62
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.900
even half specialized breathing organs like spiracles and ASACs

63
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.540
that certain scales diffusion is just too slow to keep cells alive.

64
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.820
The fundamental problem is that the exchange with the environment can only

65
00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:11.800
happen at the surface and diffusion of materials can only sustain a

66
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:14.350
certain amount of insight.

67
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.780
Tiny living things have only a little bit of inside or volume

68
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.780
and a lot of outside or surface area.

69
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.350
But what if we wanted to create a bacteria,

70
00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:31.030
the size of a blue whale and had a very convenient enlargement machine,

71
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.280
we would sadly be messed up by the square cube law. In a nutshell,

72
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.380
it means that if you make something 10 times larger it's outside or surface

73
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.090
would grow by 100,

74
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.860
but its insides or volume grows by 1000 times.

75
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.930
If we compare the bacterium pseudomonas original. So with a blue whale,

76
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.060
we see that the bacterium has 10 million times more surface in relation

77
00:04:58.061 --> 00:04:59.770
to its volume than the whale.

78
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.870
The bacterium has a lot of outsides while the whale has a lot of insights.

79
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.020
If we make a bacterium, the size of a whale,

80
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.800
our giant bacteria now has too much inside.

81
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.980
And most of it's inside is now very far from its surface.

82
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.530
The oxygen our bacteria needs would never reach the inside before it would run

83
00:05:20.531 --> 00:05:24.940
out of oxygen. Our giant bacterium would just die.

84
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.860
Still being bigger,

85
00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:31.150
has many upsides from making it harder to be eaten,

86
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.550
to making it easier to eat others.

87
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.040
But the size of cells is limited by the distance oxygen and nutrients can

88
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.730
affectively diffuse to provide the inside with enough resources.

89
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.280
So life avoided this problem by forming of multicellular structures,

90
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.150
beings composed of many cells instead of one,

91
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.650
because diffusion works better. If you have many small units, instead of one,

92
00:05:57.651 --> 00:06:00.260
much bigger one over time,

93
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.010
the cell buddies began to share work and specialize.

94
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.620
Some cells concentrated on sensing the environment, others on digestion,

95
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.400
others on movement, but that still wasn't enough.

96
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.680
The problem of diffusion and surface and energy production remained limiting the

97
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:21.920
size. These first multicellular forms of life could attain.

98
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.980
So in order to become even bigger knife solve the diffusion problem by having

99
00:06:27.981 --> 00:06:31.880
holes and caves and tunnels and by folding in on itself.

100
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.680
So diffusion could happen easily in each one of the cells take

101
00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:39.650
yourself. What you consider your outside.

102
00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:43.460
Your skin has a surface area of about two square meters,

103
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.990
but your lungs have a surface area of about 70 square meters.

104
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.000
They aren't like balloons.

105
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.140
They're more like sponges filled with many tiny packs, tiny balloons,

106
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.910
surrounded by blood vessels.

107
00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.710
When you breathe in all these tiny balloons, fill up with fresh air.

108
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.760
Blood filled out with CO2 is pumped around the balloons.

109
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.270
And then the magic of diffusion happens.

110
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.520
The oxygen diffuses into the blood where it's picked up by red blood cells

111
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.650
and the CO2 diffuses out of the blood and into your lungs where it can be

112
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.820
breathed out again. Your blood then carries oxygen,

113
00:07:22.821 --> 00:07:27.410
rich blood into the furthest corners of your body and picks up the CO2 waste.

114
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.000
Diffusion in the body is effective at about one millimeter.

115
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.190
So every cell in your body is at most one millimeter away from a blood vessel.

116
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.770
So medium size animals.

117
00:07:39.771 --> 00:07:43.460
Like you need a lot of blood vessels to reach every cell in the body.

118
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:49.010
Your body has around 100,000 kilometers of cup. Hillary's alone.

119
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.870
The tiniest of your blood vessels with a surface area of around 1000

120
00:07:53.871 --> 00:07:54.710
square meters.

121
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:59.180
This is true for all parts of you that want to exchange something with the

122
00:07:59.181 --> 00:08:04.010
outside world. Your body needs surfaces to take in nutrients from your food.

123
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:08.990
So your gut has the surface area of half a Babington called roughly 40 square

124
00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:13.190
meters. The larger you are, the more hidden surfaces you need.

125
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.500
Take a tree it's way to stay alive is to create sugar out of thin air and

126
00:08:18.501 --> 00:08:22.310
sunlight. So it needs as much surface area as possible.

127
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:27.740
An orange tree with 2000 leaves has a leaf surface area of 200

128
00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:28.574
square meters.

129
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.380
But the surface inside the leaves where the fusion actually occurs is

130
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.390
6,000 square meters.

131
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:40.340
The same with roots where water diffuses from the soil into countless tiny hairs

132
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.110
that maximize the surface area,

133
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.840
the roots of one square meter of grass at up to around 350

134
00:08:47.841 --> 00:08:49.280
square meters of surface.

135
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:54.080
If we look at the breathtaking diversity of life on this planet,

136
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:58.980
it seems like everything is pretty different and it is,

137
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.590
but some basic principles are the same for everybody and have not changed

138
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.970
significantly for billions of years. If we look at the very,

139
00:09:08.971 --> 00:09:10.560
very small, all of the very,

140
00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:14.790
very big waste goes out and fresh fuel comes in

141
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:20.280
big animals just need a lot of complex plumbing to make it possible.

142
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.720
Fresh fuel is something we can all use from time to time,

143
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.730
especially for our creativity audit ready takes is to try something new

144
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.730
and we have the perfect opportunity to get you started.

145
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.770

151
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:57.270
we've made a couple of skills have courses that teach you how we animated scenes

152
00:09:57.271 --> 00:10:00.720
from our videos with video lessons, classes and hands-on projects,

153
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.270
or if you'd rather look into illustration first,

154
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.530
we recommend Adobe illustrator level up your colors by Hayden obey.

155
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.530
But what you pick first doesn't really matter that much.

156
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:14.850
The important part is to get started, have some fun and get new inspiration.
