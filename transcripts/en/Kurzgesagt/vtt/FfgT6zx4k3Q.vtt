00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.810
<v 0>Electricity is all around us all the time.</v>

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.840
It makes our lives easier, safer,

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.360
more fun than most of us never think about it.

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.610
But is there such a thing as too much Alec Tricity could?

5
00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:19.050
The thing that is the foundation of the modern world slowly be killing us

6
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.740
Before we dive deeper.

7
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.910
Let's try to understand what electricity is and how it affects us.

8
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.900
Electricity is the movement of an electric charge.

9
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.730
This movement generates electric and magnetic fields that spread out through

10
00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:47.420
space and carry energy. We call this phenomenon,

11
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.370
electromagnetic radiation.

12
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.850
Radiation is a word that makes people very nervous,

13
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.640
but to radiate just means giving off,

14
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.900
like when the radiator in your house gives off heat in the form of infrared

15
00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:00.734
radiation,

16
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.420
different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum correspond to different types of

17
00:01:05.421 --> 00:01:08.990
radiation. And many of them are perfectly harmless.

18
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.630
Some of them can be dangerous though.

19
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.390
Radiation with very short wavelengths like UV light x-rays and gamma rays

20
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.660
are strong enough to rip electrons out of their atoms,

21
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.240
which can cause burns and genetic damage.

22
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.290
This is what many people have in mind when they hear the term radiation,

23
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.600
the rest of the spectrum covers a large range of longer waves from visible light

24
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.870
infrared microwaves to radio waves.

25
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.730
This is the kind of radiation that's emitted by all sorts of human technology,

26
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.860
mobile phones, Li-Fi rouges electric power lines and household appliances.

27
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.870
This radiation doesn't disrupt molecules in our body. However,

28
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.520
some kinds of radiation can stimulate muscles and nerves and can also make the

29
00:01:55.521 --> 00:01:56.900
hair on your body vibrate,

30
00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.130
which can sometimes cause 18 B feeling above certain threshold values.

31
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.940
Other kinds of useful for making dinner, microwaves,

32
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.060
push the water molecules in your food around, which warms it up.

33
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.450
This happens to us all the time. For example,

34
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.140
the pleasant warmth you feel at the beach is your skin heating up from exposure

35
00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:18.020
to electromagnetic infrared radiation from the sun.

36
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.420
We are surrounded by natural and generally harmless sources of electromagnetic

37
00:02:23.421 --> 00:02:25.880
radiation all the time and always have been.

38
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.670
But since the industrial revolution,

39
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.670
we have added a lot of it to our immediate environment.

40
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.260
The question of whether this is actually dangerous first got public attention.

41
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.610
When a 1979 study linked to leukemia to living near power lines.

42
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.060
This particular study was quickly discredited though.

43
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.070
The connection could not be explained and low direct causal link was confirmed,

44
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.560
but once this had been proposed,

45
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.670
the idea persisted and the thousands of studies about possible dangers

46
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.520
illustrate that it's still seen as a very real threat.

47
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.400
A lot of people came to be sensitive to the radiation coming from our appliances

48
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:07.840
and cell phones. They report symptoms like headaches, nausea,

49
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.750
skin reactions, burning eyes or exhaustion,

50
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.620
but those are just effects reported on a day-to-day basis.

51
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.080
A few studies have found much more unsettling results like possible connections

52
00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:21.280
between the side of the brain,

53
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:24.640
which people use when they're on their phones and the appearance of brain

54
00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:25.474
tumors.

55
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.920
The question that science is trying to answer is not so much about the acute

56
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:32.710
effects of irradiation. We know, for example,

57
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:35.830
that x-rays cause immediate damage to the DNA in your cells,

58
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.560
but that the same doesn't happen with radio waves.

59
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.690
The question is rather is the sort of weak electromagnetic radiation.

60
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:48.490
We are constantly surrounded by harmful in the long run as a result of some

61
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:53.410
as yet unknown mechanism answering this question was much harder than

62
00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:57.340
we first thought. There are thousands of primary sources, reports,

63
00:03:57.341 --> 00:04:00.130
and statements by an onslaught of different organizations.

64
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.290
So we read a lot for this video.

65
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.260
You can take a look at our research in the video description.

66
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.150
What we found is that this debate is a good example of how science should be

67
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:12.100
communicated and how it shouldn't.

68
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.930
Many of the much cited studies that spread panic about electromagnetic radiation

69
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.720
are highly controversial. For example,

70
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.720
a series of population studies based on surveys.

71
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:26.350
And self-reporting what this means is for example,

72
00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:27.760
asking brain tumor patients,

73
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:30.700
how much they think they use their phone in the last few years,

74
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.820
the problem is that people are unreliable.

75
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.510
We tend to misremember things or can be influenced easily.

76
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.430
On top of this studies or media reports may be cherry picking the findings that

77
00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:46.720
best suit their opinion, or make the most exciting headline. For example,

78
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.770
a study looking for cancer in rats and mice from cell phone radiation,

79
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.500
the results seemed to show a connection,

80
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.240
but for some reason only in male rats and none at all in mice,

81
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.010
but it was reported as if this study did prove that mobile phone radiation

82
00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:05.320
causes cancer. Unfortunately,

83
00:05:05.321 --> 00:05:09.130
this is the case for studies with both positive and negative findings on the

84
00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:11.920
issue. Another aspect is that the,

85
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:16.300
who did officially classify radio frequency fields as possibly

86
00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:17.134
carcinogenic.

87
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.640
But what this actually means is that there are some hints that they might cause

88
00:05:21.641 --> 00:05:25.030
cancer, but we can't prove it and that we will keep an eye out.

89
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.880
So if we zoom out a bit, what's the big picture on the whole.

90
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.260
There was no consistent evidence in human studies that electromagnetic radiation

91
00:05:35.261 --> 00:05:38.140
below exposure value limits causes health problems.

92
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.140
There are some statistical associations,

93
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.840
but they're mostly weak and inconsistent.

94
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.030
If there were any definite cause effect relations we would know by now because

95
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:53.020
of all the data we have. So based on the current state of science,

96
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.410
should you worry about the radiation from your laptop or cell phone or TV?

97
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.530
The answer is no you shouldn't,

98
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.110
but what about the people that say is,

99
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.860
is harming them research showed that they could be experiencing,

100
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:09.020
what's known as the Nazi CBO effects.

101
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.650
If you have a headache and happened to start feeling better, right?

102
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:14.030
When you switch off your laptop,

103
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.910
you might see a connection between those two things.

104
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.010
Once you get this suspicion, the idea alone that week radiation might harm.

105
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:26.960
You could be the very thing harming you. It's easy to belittle these people.

106
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.540
Most of them feel they're not being taken seriously,

107
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.920
which makes the situation even worse for them. They should get support,

108
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.110
but it's important to be aware that so far we have no robust evidence that

109
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.890
electricity below safety limits has any negative effect on humans.

110
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.570
In the attention economy we live in talking about unproven.

111
00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:51.350
Dangers can make us neglect things that we know for sure about for us.

112
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.120
Just one example,

113
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.950
outdoor air pollution is linked to 4.2 million premature deaths each year,

114
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.140
and is definitely something we could have a real impact on today still to

115
00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:04.160
make people feel safe.

116
00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:08.240
And just to make sure there are several long-term studies ongoing already.

117
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:09.350
For example,

118
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:13.250
the cosmos study that will look at the possible health impacts of cell phone use

119
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.940
by exactly measuring frequency and duration of phone calls.

120
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.260
But while we wait for the conclusion of these long-term studies,

121
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.990
there are a not more pressing problems to focus on.

122
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.170
Like instead of worrying what devices and networks do to your health,

123
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.680
consider how they can harm you. In other ways, when we shop online,

124
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.930
share photos or watch YouTube videos,

125
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.110
we leave a trail of accounts and passwords all over the internet.

126
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.060
Radio waves may not hurt us,

127
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.630
but people trying to take advantage of our data certainly will.

128
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.500
If a service becomes compromised, hackers can get your password.

129
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.470
And if you use the same login details, anywhere else,

130
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:55.760
they can easily slip in your other accounts. That's why we use Dashlane.

131
00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:00.530
It's just one app to stay safe online on any device operating system or browser.
