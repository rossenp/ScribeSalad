00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.980
<v 0>For most of our history,</v>

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.900
this human population grew slowly until new discoveries brought us more food and

3
00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:09.870
made us live longer in just a hundred years.

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.970
The human population quadrupled this led to apocalyptic visions

5
00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:16.230
of an overcrowded earth,

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.550
but the population growth rate actually peaked in the 1960s.

7
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.860
Since then fertility rates have crashed as countries industrialize and develop.

8
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.111
The world.

9
00:00:27.111 --> 00:00:31.460
Population is now expected to balance out at around 11 billion by the end of the

10
00:00:31.461 --> 00:00:35.420
century. But the big picture conceals the details.

11
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.880
Let's look at one region in particular Sub-Saharan Africa in 2019

12
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.510
teen, it was home to a billion people living in 46 countries.

13
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.200
Although its growth rate has slowed down in the last few decades,

14
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.600
it's still much higher than in the rest of the world.

15
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.130
While some projections expect around 2.6 billion people,

16
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.940
others record with up to 5 billion by 2,100,

17
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.810
the such growth would be a huge challenge for any society,

18
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.680
but Sub-Saharan Africa is also the poorest region on earth.

19
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.070
So is Sub-Saharan Africa dude,

20
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.050
and why to the projections vary by 2.4 billion people as

21
00:01:15.051 --> 00:01:16.760
always it's complicated.

22
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.980
Sub-Saharan Africa is a made up idea and in many ways an unhelpful one

23
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.990
Botswana is as far away from Sierra Leone as Ireland is from Kazakhstan.

24
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.490
And they have about as much in common, but without generalizing a little bit,

25
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.290
this video would be an hour long.

26
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.940
We've also talked to many different scientists for this video and they disagreed

27
00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:42.920
on a lot of things, mainly on how much fertility matters to poverty.

28
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.000
We've done our best to summarize our research and what they told us,

29
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.900
but take it with a grain of salt and check out our sources where we discuss this

30
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.430
in more detail. Okay. Let's zoom out to the global perspective. Again,

31
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.650
a few decades ago,

32
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.850
many countries in Asia were at a similar point to Sub-Saharan Africa. Today.

33
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.320
Large parts of the population were living in extreme poverty and birth rates

34
00:02:06.321 --> 00:02:10.310
were very high. Take Bangladesh in the 1960s,

35
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.130
the average woman had seven children in her lifetime.

36
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.560
25% of them died before they turned five and of the ones that survived only

37
00:02:18.561 --> 00:02:23.390
one in five would learn to read and write life expectancy was around 45

38
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.540
and per capita income was among the lowest in the world.

39
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.120
So beginning in the 1960s,

40
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.710
Bangladesh started a family planning program based on three main pillars.

41
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.140
One education helps to change women's outlook women with a higher

42
00:02:39.141 --> 00:02:39.741
education,

43
00:02:39.741 --> 00:02:44.480
tend to want fewer kids and become mothers later in life to better

44
00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:45.021
health care,

45
00:02:45.021 --> 00:02:49.100
lower child mortality leading to parents wanting fewer children because they

46
00:02:49.101 --> 00:02:50.570
could expect them to survive.

47
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.270
Three fields workers brought contraceptives even to the remotest areas,

48
00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.390
which drove contraceptive use from 8% in 1975 to 76% in

49
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:03.450
2019 together,

50
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.640
these measures greatly slowed down population growth. In 1960,

51
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.230
the average Bangladeshi woman had seven kids in 1995, four,

52
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.840
and in 2019, it was down to two.

53
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.300
This also changed the country's demographics and the economy before many

54
00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:24.600
children were born, but died before they got to contribute to society.

55
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.440
As far fewer kids die and fewer kids are born things,

56
00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:32.250
change kids get an education and turn into productive adults.

57
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.420
The government was able to shift some of their resources from lowering child

58
00:03:36.421 --> 00:03:40.800
mortality to boosting the economy by 2024,

59
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.640
Bangladesh is expected to graduate from the category of least developed

60
00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:47.160
countries to the status of a developing economy.

61
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.300
Other Asian countries like South Korea, India, Thailand,

62
00:03:51.301 --> 00:03:53.850
or the Philippines have gone through a similar process.

63
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.650
Often even faster investment in health and education led to lower birth

64
00:03:58.651 --> 00:03:59.100
rates,

65
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.090
which changed the composition of the population and enabled governments to boost

66
00:04:03.091 --> 00:04:07.980
the economy. Why didn't the same thing happen everywhere in Sub-Saharan Africa,

67
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.540
Africa as a whole has made considerable progress with childhood mortality,

68
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.030
but especially in Sub-Saharan Africa,

69
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.150
education has improved slower than in other parts of the world.

70
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.560
And one in total contraceptive use has doubled in the region since 1990.

71
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.940
The unmet need for modern contraception among adolescents is still at about

72
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:27.870
60%.

73
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.220
The reasons for this are complicated and it's impossible to give a single answer

74
00:04:32.221 --> 00:04:36.000
here. Africa is a big place with diverse cultures and people,

75
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.950
but there are a few main factors.

76
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.900
Many Sub-Saharan nations have suffered under colonization until only a few

77
00:04:42.901 --> 00:04:46.950
decades ago and had a rough transition periods towards independence.

78
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.390
The young nations were often ethnically heterogeneous and lacks unity.

79
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.890
Some areas have been repeated the wracked by civil Wars, military conflicts,

80
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.990
or suffered under unstable governments,

81
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.200
which made it really hard to expand infrastructure and healthcare.

82
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.420
So Africa had a worst starting point than Asia foreign aid and how it was

83
00:05:06.421 --> 00:05:10.200
applied, especially during the cold war is also a contentious issue,

84
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.040
but this topic is too complex to summarize in a few sentences.

85
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.300
So we'll make a whole video about it in the future. And lastly,

86
00:05:18.301 --> 00:05:21.600
there are cultural aspects that make talking about family planning in the

87
00:05:21.601 --> 00:05:24.660
context of Africa, difficult critics say that,

88
00:05:24.661 --> 00:05:28.590
trying to bring fertility down is an intrusion into culture and tradition,

89
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.130
but not speaking about an issue will not help solve it.

90
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.430
Not all of these things apply to every country in the region.

91
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.190
We're talking about 46 countries after all,

92
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.130
some of them deeply troubled others already flourishing,

93
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.560
all different and facing unique problems.

94
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.920
If population growth continues at its present rate,

95
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.990
then Sub-Saharan Africa could grow to more than 4 billion people by 2,100.

96
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.250
Okay. So what can be done actually a lot,

97
00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.010
especially investment and aid that helped to build systems for education,

98
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.990
family planning and health care.

99
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.540
Surprisingly small changes could have an extreme impact. For example,

100
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.510
if women get a better education and have their first child,

101
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:13.070
just two years later in life,

102
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.380
this tiny gap between this generation and the next one would lead to 400 million

103
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:22.400
fewer people in 2,100 with 3.6 billion in total,

104
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.980
if education and family planning are made available to every African woman,

105
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.940
universal access to contraception makes having kids a decision.

106
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:37.460
If families get to choose how many kids they want birth projections fall by 30%

107
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.900
to 2.8 billion people. This isn't just theory.

108
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.310
There are already examples that are reason for optimism, Ethiopia,

109
00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:49.520
the African country with the second biggest population has made a lot of

110
00:06:49.521 --> 00:06:51.770
progress in a relatively short amount of time.

111
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.780
Improving health services led to a drop in child mortality from 20% to

112
00:06:56.781 --> 00:07:01.520
7% since 1990 and up to 30% of the annual

113
00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:03.470
budget was invested in education.

114
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.310
And the number of schools increased 25 fold over two decades.

115
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.690
So summarizing there are serious challenges ahead,

116
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.550
but they are far from unsolvable.

117
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.790
Sub-Saharan Africa does not need petty or gifts,

118
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:21.890
but attention and fair investment. It's a region rich in resources, culture,

119
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.380
and potential. If things go right,

120
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:28.550
we'll see a turnaround similar to the one we've seen across most of Asia in the

121
00:07:28.551 --> 00:07:29.720
last 30 years.

122
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:41.380
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>
