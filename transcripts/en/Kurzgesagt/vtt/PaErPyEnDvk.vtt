00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.410
<v 0>Sometimes the world feels boring.</v>

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.380
We've visited all the remote islands,

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.490
conquered the Arctic and penetrated the deepest jungles,

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.210
but there is still one place to explore.

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.700
It's a wet and deadly desert inhabited by mysterious creatures

6
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.830
living in total darkness.

7
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.430
The deep sea that's dive down.

8
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.710
When we look at the sheer scale of the Earth's oceans,

9
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.510
it's hard to believe that less than 2% of all biomass on earth lives here

10
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.150
and of that small percentage around 90% is located close to the

11
00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:52.490
surface in the first 200 meters.

12
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.580
This is where we begin our journey.

13
00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.790
Headlight can still penetrate the water,

14
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.380
which allows photo synthesis to occur phytoplankton, trillions,

15
00:01:03.381 --> 00:01:05.000
and trillions of single celled,

16
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:09.200
algae and bacteria make up the foundation of the ocean's ecosystem.

17
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.000
And they're consumed by bigger plankton who are consumed by other species.

18
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.670
The sea floor at this depth is akin to the Amazon rainforest and is often

19
00:01:19.671 --> 00:01:22.580
covered with coral reefs, algae, and other seed plants.

20
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.980
These are home to a plethora of sea animals so far we've focused most of our

21
00:01:27.981 --> 00:01:32.510
attention on this comparatively pleasant environment where we fish swim,

22
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.640
pollute and do science. So let's dive deeper,

23
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.230
moving from familiar coastal waters into deeper, more remote waters.

24
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.470
We eventually reached the edge of the continental shelf,

25
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.750
where we're confronted with the continental slope,

26
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.880
the long descent down to the deep sea with every additional meter

27
00:01:52.881 --> 00:01:55.400
of water light fades drastically,

28
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.240
which means there are basically no more plants and the seemingly steep

29
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.810
continental slope begins to remind us of the surface of the moon,

30
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.580
looking out where faced by what seems to be endless open water.

31
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.140
Let's leave the slope behind us and enter. What's known as the Twilight zone,

32
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.070
the portal to the deep sea. As we sink down further,

33
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.830
the water pressure rises to deadly levels.

34
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.600
The deepest scuba dive ever came in at 332 meters.

35
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.220
At that depth,

36
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.900
the pressure is like having 200 cars stacked on top of you yet.

37
00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:34.790
We've only completed 3% of our journey while this region

38
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:36.080
seems pretty grim,

39
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.280
many fish and other animals actually spend at least half their lives down here

40
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.863
during the day.

41
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.520
It's a good place to rest and recover hidden from predators in the vast dark

42
00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:48.290
waters at night,

43
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.040
they can travel more safely into shallower zones to feed in the food.

44
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.050
Rich surface waters in this transition zone between Twilight and

45
00:02:57.051 --> 00:02:59.800
darkness light becomes a powerful tool.

46
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.750
Over 90% of the species indigenous to this deep environment,

47
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.690
use bioluminescence chemicals to create night.

48
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.420
They do set last camouflage against the very faint sunlight to send signals to

49
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:16.570
potential mates or to confuse and scare attackers,

50
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.420
or they use likes to hunt.

51
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.360
Another tool for survival in the dark is teamwork at around 700

52
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:28.570
meters. We encounter a colony of siphonophores.

53
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.180
They can be up to 50 meters in length,

54
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.320
but are only as wide as a broomstick to attract prey.

55
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.210
A colony creates a tragically beautiful bright blue or red light and

56
00:03:40.211 --> 00:03:40.870
deploys.

57
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.640
A curtain of tentacles filled with toxic needles that kill anything that

58
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:46.900
comes to close.

59
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.300
But most species living down here have to rely on an unlikely resource

60
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.111
Marine,

61
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:57.880
snow white flaky stuff that constantly sinks from the surface to the

62
00:03:57.881 --> 00:04:02.200
bottom of the ocean. It consists of dead plant or animal parts,

63
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.320
fecal matter shells, sand or dust,

64
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.410
even though this doesn't sound very tasty without this crucial resource life in

65
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:14.950
the deep sea woodstove it's in this area,

66
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:18.760
that the most fascinating battles between two unlikely enemies could happen.

67
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.650
Sperm, whales, Hunter, and attack giant square to the size of a house.

68
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.660
While the squid fight back ferociously, they probably don't stand a chance,

69
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.870
but they do leave permanent marks on their killer skin.

70
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.480
As we reach 1000 meters deeper than the tallest structure built by humans,

71
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.170
we need to be careful. This is the midnight zone,

72
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.690
a place of utter darkness,

73
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.270
a barely explored wet wasteland consisting of nothing but endless blank.

74
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.370
Open water at these deaths is harder for a human to take a swim than to

75
00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:55.750
take a walk in space.

76
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.440
Finding food down here is really hard.

77
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.220
So life had to adapt and become extremely energy efficient,

78
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.050
like the 30 centimeter long vampire squid that floats through the water without

79
00:05:08.051 --> 00:05:12.880
motion with long than slender catching arms extended they're covered

80
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:16.330
in tiny stiff has which brush food from the water.

81
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.860
This saves a lot of energy compared to activate catching food

82
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.350
for carnivorous fish.

83
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.820
It's much harder to find food since living prey is quite rare down here.

84
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.470
So the hunters have to get a perfect grip on their victim on first strike.

85
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.600
Otherwise it will escape into the dark many deep sea predators have

86
00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:41.740
several sets of long and deadly teeth like the Viper fish,

87
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.970
which uses its long fangs to trap even large prey and swallow it.

88
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.860
Hold all the frill chalk with its impressive set of 300 teeth,

89
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.490
which are curved backwards to hook their victims in their mouths.

90
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.180
We sink further below the 3,800 Mark,

91
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.570
as deep as the grave Titanic.

92
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.070
We are now at abyssal depths here.

93
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.170
Life happens in slow motion.

94
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.210
Preserving every last bit of energy is crucial for survival.

95
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:15.970
Everything down here, hovers,

96
00:06:15.971 --> 00:06:19.660
motionless or swims in a slow elegant fashion.

97
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.690
The only time the animals living in this sonar move fast is when they have to

98
00:06:25.691 --> 00:06:26.590
escape danger,

99
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.200
like the Dumbo Octopod paddling with its airline fins or the Grenederes

100
00:06:32.201 --> 00:06:36.820
fish with its slow eel like tail beets at 4,000

101
00:06:36.821 --> 00:06:39.010
meters, we finally reached ground again.

102
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.250
The abyssal plane it's coveting grain,

103
00:06:42.251 --> 00:06:45.430
modern rocks dusted with the remains of Marine snow,

104
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.280
which is consumed by animals like sea cucumbers,

105
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.890
shrimp [inaudible] and sea worms.

106
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.930
In some regions of the sea floor, small dark mineral deposits can be seen.

107
00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.120
These are manganese nodules, deep sea corals,

108
00:07:01.121 --> 00:07:05.830
and sponges use them to anchor themselves on the bottom of the sea. Though.

109
00:07:05.831 --> 00:07:09.040
Life is sparse on the deep sea floor. Even down here,

110
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.690
there are oases in the rift valleys where tectonic plates are spitting

111
00:07:13.691 --> 00:07:14.410
apart.

112
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:19.270
Magma heats up seawater and creates dump jets of water and minerals as hot as

113
00:07:19.271 --> 00:07:23.350
400 degrees Celsius that form elaborate chimneys and towers.

114
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.990
Extremophile bacteria use the minerals to create organic substances that are the

115
00:07:28.991 --> 00:07:33.370
basis for unique ecosystems. As we descend further,

116
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.630
we reach the deepest point of the abyssal painter at 6,000 meters.

117
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.440
For most of the C4. This is as deep as it gets,

118
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.440
but if we want to get to the deepest point of the oceans,

119
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:49.420
we're actually only halfway there let's enter the Hayden zone,

120
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.220
the underworld of the sea.

121
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.770
It consists of long narrow trenches that only make up around at the 0.2,

122
00:07:56.771 --> 00:08:01.300
5% of the oceans and are among the most extreme environments on earth

123
00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:07.060
only extremophiles exist down here like the Ethereum snail fish that

124
00:08:07.061 --> 00:08:11.980
holds the record for the deepest living fish ever seen at around 8,000 meters.

125
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:17.380
We see spiky and sharp black rocks rush by as we sink down to more than 10,000,

126
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.740
it wasn't until we reached the final slope,

127
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:26.260
a trench inside the larger Mariana trench with gently sloping sides that

128
00:08:26.261 --> 00:08:29.320
in frame of Valley, about 1.6 kilometers wide,

129
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.920
this is the deepest point.

130
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.270
The challenge of deep 11,000 meters below the surface

131
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:44.110
water pressure here is 1086 bar taking

132
00:08:44.111 --> 00:08:48.100
a swim hair is like having to balance 1800 elephants on top of you.

133
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.073
But even here,

134
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:54.430
life has found a way to thrive next to sea cucumbers,

135
00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:57.810
white light pink amphipods wiggle their way through the water.

136
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.240
Their size is astounding while they're shallow water cousins of media,

137
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:04.380
a few centimeters long,

138
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:09.480
the deep sea version can reach up to 30 centimeters and

139
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:14.520
there are other things floating elegantly through the water plastic bags that

140
00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:16.830
were found by scientists in 2018.

141
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.080
Even the remotest place on earth is not safe from human influence.

142
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.180
There is nothing left to do now and our oxygen is running out.

143
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.010
So we begin our set.

144
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:39.320
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

145
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.840
<v 0>After hours of traveling through dark nothingness,</v>

146
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.240
we finally see a glimpse of light.

147
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.150
We arrive back at a calm surface.

148
00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:52.760
The oceans are so deep. There is so much of them.

149
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:58.310
We owe it to ourselves and to our descendants to preserve them as well as we

150
00:09:58.311 --> 00:09:59.180
can.

151
00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.830
There are still so many wondrous things left to be discovered.

152
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:12.980
So you're all tingling now and want to go exploring why not start

153
00:10:12.981 --> 00:10:14.510
off with some juicy science.

154
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:18.830
You can use our friends from brilliant as your springboard for a knowledge deep

155
00:10:18.831 --> 00:10:23.090
dive. Brilliant is a website that helps you approach science in a practical way

156
00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:28.190

go ahead and take the plunge. Do you need more vitamin C?

168
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:18.110
We've also made an Epic poster featuring some of the most fascinating creatures

169
00:11:18.111 --> 00:11:22.460
