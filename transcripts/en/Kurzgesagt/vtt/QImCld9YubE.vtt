00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.460
<v 0>At this very second, you are on a narrow ledge between life and death.</v>

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.830
You probably don't feel it,

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.490
but there's an incredible amount of activity going on inside you.

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.340
And this activity can never stop picture yourself.

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.090
As a slinky, falling down an escalator, moving upwards,

6
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.130
the falling part represents the self-replicating processes of yourselves.

7
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.200
The escalator represents the laws of physics driving you forwards

8
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.180
to be alive is to be in motion, but never arriving anywhere.

9
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.400
If you reach the top of the escalator,

10
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.180
there's no more falling possible and you are dead forever,

11
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.820
somewhat. Unsettlingly the universe wants you to reach the top.

12
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.080
How do you avoid that? And why are you alive?

13
00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.143
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

14
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.990
<v 0>All. Life is based on the cell.</v>

15
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.210
A cell is a piece of the dead universe that separated itself from the rest.

16
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.040
So it could do its own thing for a while. When this separation breaks down,

17
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.460
it dies and joins the rest of the dead universe. Again,

18
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.500
unfortunately,

19
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.610
the universe would like for life to be done with doing its own thing.

20
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.970
For some reason, it's not a fan of exciting things,

21
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.580
but tries to be as boring as possible.

22
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.010
We call this principle entropy, and it's a fundamental rule of our universe.

23
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.500
It's pretty complicated. And counter-intuitive so we'll explain it in detail.

24
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.080
In another video for now,

25
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.440
all you need to know is living things are inherently exciting.

26
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.640
A cell is filled up with millions of proteins and millions,

27
00:01:49.641 --> 00:01:51.530
more simpler molecules like water.

28
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.630
Thousands of complex self-replicating processes are happening up to hundreds of

29
00:01:56.631 --> 00:02:01.070
thousands of times, every second to stay alive and exciting.

30
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.840
It has to constantly work to keep itself from achieving entropy and becoming

31
00:02:05.841 --> 00:02:06.890
boring and debt.

32
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.390
The cell has to maintain the separation from the rest of the universe.

33
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.550
It's doing this for example,

34
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.450
by keeping the concentration of certain molecules different on the inside and

35
00:02:17.451 --> 00:02:22.430
the outside by actively pumping out excess molecules to do stuff like

36
00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:24.530
this. A cell needs energy.

37
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.910
Energy is the ability of things in the universe to do work,

38
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.270
to move or manipulate a thing to create change

39
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.690
visibility cannot be created or destroyed.

40
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.840
The set amount of energy in the universe will never change.

41
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.880
We don't know why it just is that way. So billions of years ago,

42
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.350
one of the most crucial challenges for the first living beings was to get usable

43
00:02:48.351 --> 00:02:51.860
energy. We don't know a lot about the first cells,

44
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.810
except that they got their energy from simple chemical reactions and they found

45
00:02:56.811 --> 00:03:01.330
the ultimate energy transfer system, the energetic building block of life,

46
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.690
the molecule adenosine triphosphate or ADP it

47
00:03:06.691 --> 00:03:10.800
structure makes it uniquely good at accepting and releasing energy.

48
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.620
When a cell needs energy, for example,

49
00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:16.620
to pump out molecules or to repair a broken micro machine,

50
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.510
it can break down ATP and use the chemical energy to do work and create

51
00:03:21.511 --> 00:03:25.620
change. This is why living beings are able to do stuff.

52
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.810
We don't know when or how exactly the first ATP molecule was made on earth,

53
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.450
but every living thing we know uses ATP or something very similar to keep

54
00:03:36.451 --> 00:03:38.040
its internal machinery running.

55
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.970
It's crucial for almost every process plants,

56
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.140
funky bacteria and animals need to survive five

57
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.270
without ATP, no life on earth, possibly anywhere.

58
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.450
Breaking down chemicals for energy is nice and all early life did miss out

59
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.540
on the greatest available source energy, the sun,

60
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.900
the sun, mergers, atoms,

61
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.100
and radiates photons away the carry energy into the solar system.

62
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.650
But this energy is raw. And in there adjustable, it needs to be refined.

63
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.970
After hundreds of millions of years of evolution, finally,

64
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.220
a cell figured out how to eat.

65
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.230
The sun is absorbed radiation and converted much of it into neat metal

66
00:04:25.231 --> 00:04:27.990
chemical packages that it could use to stay alive.

67
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.930
We call this process photosynthesis.

68
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.180
You take photons that are wobbly with electromagnetic energy and use a part of

69
00:04:36.181 --> 00:04:39.420
this energy to merge and combine different molecules together.

70
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.760
The electromagnetic energy is converted into chemical energy stored in the

71
00:04:44.761 --> 00:04:49.020
ATP molecule. This process became even better.

72
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.320
As some cells learn to create better chemical packages,

73
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.420
glucose or sugar,

74
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.040
easy to break down high in energy and pretty tasty.

75
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.080
This is so convenient that some cells decided that instead of doing all that

76
00:05:04.081 --> 00:05:06.240
pesky photosynthesis work themselves,

77
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.920
they will just swallow other cells that days and take their glucose and ATP.

78
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.290
This is widely considered one of the biggest anime betrayals in evolutionary

79
00:05:16.291 --> 00:05:17.124
history.

80
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.350
And so things went on photosynthesizing cells could mostly harness energy and

81
00:05:22.351 --> 00:05:25.770
their surfaces, which limited their maximum energy production,

82
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.420
which limited that evolutionary Avenue somewhat. So time passed.

83
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.670
Some cells made sugar, others ate them. Evolution did its thing,

84
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.930
but overall things stayed pretty much the same for hundreds of millions and of

85
00:05:39.931 --> 00:05:44.550
years until one day a cell ate another

86
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.680
and did not kill it. Instead, they became one cell,

87
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.750
nothing had changed that day, but earth would be different forever.

88
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.990
This cell became the ancestor of all animals on this planet.

89
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.360
Blue whales, amoeba dinosaurs, jellyfish, pink fairy,

90
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:07.610
armadillos, and Sunder colugos.

91
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.980
And of course you all can trace back their existence. To this moment.

92
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.860
The merging of two living beings is so important because when those two cells

93
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:21.500
became one, they became way more powerful.

94
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.780
The formerly independent cell in the inside could stop trying to survive.

95
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.470
It could concentrate on one thing, make ATP.

96
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.000
It became the powerhouse of the cell. The first mitochondria,

97
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.580
the host cells job became to ensure survival in the dangerous world and provide

98
00:06:40.581 --> 00:06:43.880
the mitochondria with food mitochondria,

99
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.050
basically reverse photosynthesis in a similarly complex process.

100
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.160
They take sugar molecules that we got from eating, other living things,

101
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.020
combust them with oxygen and precursor molecules to make new energy rich

102
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.310
ATP molecules.

103
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.860
This process works like a tiny furnace and spits out waste products like CO2

104
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:08.390
water and a little bit of kinetic energy that you experience as body heat.

105
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.000
This first division of labor,

106
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.890
the new cell had way more energy available than any cell before,

107
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:19.630
which meant more possibilities for evolution to enable wall complex sounds.

108
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:21.183
At some point,

109
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:26.470
these cells began to form small groups or communities which led to multicellular

110
00:07:26.471 --> 00:07:30.130
life. And finally to you today,

111
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:34.300
you are a pile of trillions of cells. Each filled with dozens.

112
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.710
If not hundreds of little machines that provide you with usable energy to stay

113
00:07:38.711 --> 00:07:43.150
alive. If this process is interrupted, even for a few minutes,

114
00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.020
you die. But if life is so fragile,

115
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:52.180
wouldn't it be a good idea to store ATP? Like we store sugar in our fat cells,

116
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.820
so we don't die. If we stop breathing for a while,

117
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.350
if life has solved so many problems to make you live today,

118
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.480
what's up with the dying quickly thing.

119
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:07.000
Even simple bacteria like e-coli make about 50 times their body weight in

120
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.920
ATP for every cell division.

121
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:14.050
Your trillions of cells need a lot of ATP to keep you around

122
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:15.610
every day.

123
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:20.230
Your body produces and converts about 19 million billion,

124
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:24.040
billion molecules of ATP about your own body weight.

125
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.380
You need a whole person's worth of ADP just to make it through a single day.

126
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:34.660
Even storing enough ATP to last you a few minutes is basically impossible.

127
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:39.220
An ATP molecule is really good for shifting energy around quickly,

128
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.410
but it's terrible for storage sends.

129
00:08:41.411 --> 00:08:46.000
It has only 1% of a glucose molecules energy at three times its mass.

130
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:51.490
So ATP is constantly produced and used out fairly quickly.

131
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:57.150
This was the short and simplified story of the molecule that allows you to be

132
00:08:57.151 --> 00:09:01.440
different from the dead universe and to be the slinky on the escalator.

133
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.630
It is a weird story.

134
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:07.110
There is this molecule you need to survive at all times.

135
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:11.730
You need it to keep moving because even a short break brings your slinky to a

136
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:14.490
stop and you need to make it yourself.

137
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:19.560
It's like driving a car at full speed while producing fuel in the trunk with

138
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.660
junk that you pick up from the side of the road.

139
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:27.300
As far as we know this all began billions of years ago when tiny parts of the

140
00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:31.200
dead universe came together and became something else for a moment,

141
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:35.880
it could keep itself going. It could grow that moment,

142
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.530
set the slinky in motion.

143
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:42.780
And it's been going ever since from the very first cells to you

144
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:44.070
watching this. Now,

145
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.380
at some point you will merge with the rest of the debt universe. Again,

146
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.880
maybe you'll tell it stories about your adventures, maybe not,

147
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:59.430
but before you find out you get to do what knife does best

148
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:04.170
making a dead universe much more interesting.

149
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.780
If you are currently bored for whatever reason,

150
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.800
and you want to make your life more interesting, we've got something for you.

151
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:15.980
We partnered with Skillshare,

152
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.980
an online learning community that offers thousands of classes for all skill

153
00:10:19.981 --> 00:10:24.600
levels on tons of creative skills like illustration, animation, cooking,

154
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:25.770
creative writing,

155
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:30.930
or film and video learning something while creating stuff for yourself is

156
00:10:30.931 --> 00:10:34.800
pretty fun and fulfilling. If you want to learn animation,

157
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.940
we made a few Skillshare classes where we explained how we animated scenes from

158
00:10:38.941 --> 00:10:42.060
our videos with video lessons and hands-on projects,

159
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:47.100
you can get unlimited access to all classes for less than $10 a month with an

160
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:48.480
annual premium membership.

161
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:52.860
And the first 1000 coats cause out viewers to click the link in the description.

162
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:54.690
We'll get a two month free trial.

163
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:59.010
And if you're just getting started for beginners who want to dip a toe into

164
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.480
illustration, similar to ours,

165
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:05.400
we recommend vector illustration using creative constraints to find your style

166
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:09.690
by Rick Bertelsmann. Just try something to improve your skills.

167
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:14.280
And at the same time fight the boredom of being stuck inside.

168
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.670
If you want to get creative with new skills and support coats,

169
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.960
cause I'd give it a try.
