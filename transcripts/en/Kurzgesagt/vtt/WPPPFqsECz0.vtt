00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.110
<v 0>Everybody is familiar with the feeling that things are not as they should be,</v>

2
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.410
that you're not successful enough.

3
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.020
Your relationship's not satisfying enough that you don't have the things you

4
00:00:12.021 --> 00:00:16.910
crave a chronic dissatisfaction that makes you look outwards

5
00:00:16.911 --> 00:00:21.590
with envy and inwards with disappointment, pop culture,

6
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.311
advertising,

7
00:00:22.311 --> 00:00:26.570
and social media make this worse by reminding you that aiming for anything less

8
00:00:26.571 --> 00:00:29.960
than your dream job is failure. You need to have great experiences,

9
00:00:29.961 --> 00:00:32.120
constantly be conventionally attractive,

10
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.990
have a lot of friends and find your soulmate and that others have all of these

11
00:00:35.991 --> 00:00:39.170
things and aren't truly happy. And of course,

12
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.580
a vast array of self-improvement products implies that it's all your fault for

13
00:00:43.581 --> 00:00:47.840
not working hard enough on yourself. In the last two decades,

14
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.500
researchers have been starting to investigate how we can counteract these

15
00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:52.334
impulses.

16
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.230
The field of positive psychology emerged the study of what makes life worth

17
00:00:57.231 --> 00:01:01.370
living while cognitive behavioral therapy was developed to change negative

18
00:01:01.371 --> 00:01:02.204
feelings.

19
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.100
Scientists began to ask why some people happier and more satisfied than others,

20
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.140
and are there ways to apply what they're doing right to the rest of us in this

21
00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:12.680
video,

22
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.010
we want to talk about one of the strongest predictors of how happy people are,

23
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.850
how easily they make friends and how good they are at dealing with hot chip,

24
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.730
an antidote to dissatisfaction.

25
00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:27.500
So to speak gratitude while gratitude may sound like another

26
00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:30.230
self-improvement trend preached by people who use hashtags.

27
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.830
What we currently know about it is based on a body of scientific work and

28
00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:36.410
studies we'll include them in the description.

29
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.940
Gratitude can mean very different things to different people in different

30
00:01:40.941 --> 00:01:43.220
contexts. It's a character trait,

31
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.340
the feeling of virtue and a behavior.

32
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.650
You can feel grateful towards someone who did something for you for random

33
00:01:51.651 --> 00:01:54.710
events like the weather, or even for nature or fate.

34
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.740
And it's wired into our biology.

35
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.160
How gratitude connects us to each other.

36
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.020
The predecessor of gratitude is probably reciprocity.

37
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.390
It bluntly evolved as a biological signal that motivates animals to exchange

38
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.200
things for their mutual benefits and can be found in the animal kingdom among

39
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.070
certain fish, birds or mammals, but especially in primates,

40
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.030
when your brain recognizes that someone's done something nice for you,

41
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.120
it reacts with gratitude to motivate you, to repay them.

42
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.130
This gratitude makes you care about others and others care about you.

43
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.750
This was important because as human brains got better at reading emotions,

44
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.720
selfish individuals were identified and shunt.

45
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.450
It became an evolutionary advantage to play well with others and build lasting

46
00:02:44.451 --> 00:02:47.180
relationships. For example,

47
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.720
if you were hungry and someone else showed you where to find tasty barriers,

48
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.070
you felt gratitude toward them and a bond to return the favor in the future,

49
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.120
a drive to be pro-social. When you repeat,

50
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.240
they felt gratitude towards you.

51
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.640
This brought your ancestors close together and forged bonds and friendships.

52
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.920
So early forms of gratitude were biological mechanisms that modified your

53
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:15.820
behavior towards corporation, which helped humans to dominate earth.

54
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.800
But over time, gratitude became more than just an impulse to play fair.

55
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.890
The consequences of gratitude,

56
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.110
the scientists found that gratitude stimulates the pathways in your brain

57
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:31.000
involved in feelings of reward,

58
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.680
forming social bonds and interpreting other's intentions.

59
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.730
It also makes it easier to save and retrieve positive memories,

60
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.250
even more gratitude,

61
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.110
directly counteracts negative feelings and traits like MV and social comparison,

62
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.410
narcissism, cynicism, and materialism.

63
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.740
As a consequence, people who are grateful,

64
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.220
no matter what for tend to be happier and more satisfied,

65
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.810
they have better relationships, an easier time. Making friends,

66
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.030
they sleep better, tend to suffer less from depression, addiction, and burnout,

67
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.680
and are better at dealing with traumatic events in a way.

68
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.520
Gratitude makes it less likely that you'll fall into one of the psychological

69
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:19.630
traps. Modern life has set for you. For example, gratitude,

70
00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:23.770
measurably counters, the tendency to forget and downplay positive events.

71
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.600
If you work long and hard for something actually getting it can feel daft and

72
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:29.434
empty.

73
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.580
You can find yourself emotionally back where you started and try to achieve the

74
00:04:33.581 --> 00:04:36.460
next biggest thing. Looking for that satisfaction.

75
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.800
Instead of being satisfied with yourself,

76
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.130
or imagine being lonely and wanting to have more friends,

77
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.420
you actually might have someone or even multiple people who want to hang out,

78
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.880
but you might feel that this is not enough,

79
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.220
that you're a loser and feel bad about yourself.

80
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.300
So you might turn down their attempts to hang out and become more lonely.

81
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.450
If you feel grateful for your relationships, instead,

82
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.810
you might accept invitations or even take the initiative.

83
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.780
The more often you risk opening up the higher,

84
00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:09.730
the chance of solidifying relationships and meeting new people in the best case,

85
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.180
gratitude can trigger a feedback loop, positive feelings,

86
00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:14.890
lead to more pro-social behavior,

87
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.000
which leads to more positive social experiences that cause more positive

88
00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:19.834
feelings.

89
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.310
This is a common experience after serious hardship like chemotherapy.

90
00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:25.144
For example,

91
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.220
life can feel amazing after a crisis is over the smallest things can be

92
00:05:30.221 --> 00:05:34.930
bottomless sources of joy from being able to taste to just sitting in the sun or

93
00:05:34.931 --> 00:05:38.920
chatting with a friend objectively your life is the same,

94
00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:41.260
or maybe even slightly worse than before,

95
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.580
but your brain compares your present experiences with the times when life was

96
00:05:45.581 --> 00:05:49.960
bad and reacts with gratitude. So in a nutshell,

97
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.861
gratitude,

98
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:55.330
refocuses your attention towards the good things you have and the consequences

99
00:05:55.331 --> 00:05:59.300
of their shift are better and more positive experiences

100
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.330
while it is great to know these things.

101
00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.290
Is there actually a way for you to feel more of it,

102
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.860
how to make your brain more grateful?

103
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.340
The ability to experience more or less gratitude is not equally distributed.

104
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:16.391
You have,

105
00:06:16.391 --> 00:06:21.310
what's known as trait gratitude that determines how much you are able to feel.

106
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.660
It. It depends on your genetics, personality and culture.

107
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.210
This discovery made scientists wonder if they could design exercises that change

108
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.940
your trained gratitude and lead to more happiness.

109
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.790
Let's start with important caveats.

110
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.080
It's not yet entirely clear to what degree gratitude can be trained or how long

111
00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:44.380
the effects last. There are no magic pills for happiness.

112
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.840
Life is complicated on some days it feels like you're in control of yourself and

113
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.020
on others, you feel like you're not. And this is okay.

114
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.550
Also sometimes pursuing happiness can make you more unhappy.

115
00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.590
If you put too much pressure on yourself,

116
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.080
gratitude should also not be seen as a solution to depression or a substitute

117
00:07:05.081 --> 00:07:08.440
for professional help. It can only be a piece of the puzzle.

118
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.810
It's not the solution to the puzzle itself.

119
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.300
The easiest gratitude exercise with the most solid research behind it is

120
00:07:16.301 --> 00:07:19.690
gratitude. Journaling. It means sitting down for a few minutes,

121
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.680
one to three times a week and writing down five to 10 things you're grateful

122
00:07:23.681 --> 00:07:27.760
for. It might feel weird at first. So start simply,

123
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.640
can you feel grateful for a little thing?

124
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.880
Like how great coffee is or that someone was kind to you?

125
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.240
Can you appreciate something someone else did for you?

126
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:41.470
Can you reflect on which things or people you would miss if they were gone and

127
00:07:41.471 --> 00:07:44.920
be grateful that they're in your life, we're all different.

128
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.820
So you'll know what works for you and that's it ready?

129
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:52.660
It feels almost insulting. Like things shouldn't be that simple,

130
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.400
but in numerous studies,

131
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:58.690
the participants reported more happiness and a higher general life satisfaction.

132
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:03.610
After doing this practice for a few weeks and even more studies have found

133
00:08:03.611 --> 00:08:05.200
changes in brain activity.

134
00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:10.120
Some months after they ended practicing gratitude may be a real way to

135
00:08:10.121 --> 00:08:11.320
reprogram yourself.

136
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:16.750
This research shows that your emotions are not fixed in the end,

137
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.890
how you experience life is a representation of what you believe about it.

138
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.700
If you attack your core beliefs about yourself and your life,

139
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.560
you can change your thoughts and feelings,

140
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.990
which automatically changes your behavior.

141
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:33.610
It's pretty mind blowing that something as simple as self-reflection can hack

142
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.520
the pathways in our brain to fight dissatisfaction.

143
00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.060
And if this is no reason to be more optimistic,

144
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.390
what is being a human is hard,

145
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.590
but it doesn't need to be as hard. And if you actively look,

146
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:51.010
you might find that your life is much better than you thought.

147
00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.180
If you're curious and want try out gratitude, we made a thing.

148
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:01.110
Please know that you don't need to buy anything from anyone to practice

149
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:04.470
gratitude. All you need is paper, the pen and five minutes.

150
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.180
Having said that we've made eight codes cause out gratitude journal based on

151
00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:13.950
studies, we've read conversations with experts and our personal experiences with

152
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:15.450
gratitude over the last year,

153
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:19.710
it's structured in a way that might make it a bit easier to get into the habit

154
00:09:19.711 --> 00:09:20.820
of gratitude journaling.

155
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.620
There are short explanations and reflections to mix it up and make it more

156
00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:28.530
interesting. We've also made it as pretty as we could.

157
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.680
This video continues the unofficial series of more personal introspective videos

158
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.070
from optimistic nihilism to loneliness and now gratitude.

159
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.380
We don't want to be a self-help channel.

160
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.320
So we'll keep this sort of video at roughly one per year.

161
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:47.220
We hope they're helpful to some of you. Thank you for watching.
