00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.070
<v 0>Today, we're doing something different. Our friend, John Green,</v>

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.700
we'll read a story from his podcast, the Anthropocene reviewed.

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.100
We hope you enjoy it. And we'll be back with a regular video soon.

4
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.360
<v 1>So if you've ever been or had a child,</v>

5
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.960
you will likely already be familiar with hand stencils.

6
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.260
They were the first figurative art made by both our kids,

7
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.810
somewhere between the ages of two and three,

8
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.160
my children spread the fingers of one hand out across a piece of paper.

9
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.300
And then with the help of a parent traced their five fingers.

10
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.430
I remember my son's face as he lifted his hand and looked absolutely

11
00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:47.750
shocked to see the shape of his hand, still on the paper,

12
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.360
a semi-permanent record of himself.

13
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.790
I am extremely happy that my children are no longer three and yet to look at

14
00:00:55.791 --> 00:01:00.680
their little hands from those early artworks is to be inundated with a strange

15
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.240
soul, splitting joy.

16
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.440
Those pictures remind me that they are not just growing up,

17
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.270
but also growing away from me running toward their own lives.

18
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.580
But of course that's meaning I am applying to their hand stencils and that

19
00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:21.500
complicated relationship between art and its viewers is never more fraught

20
00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:26.270
than when we are looking deeply into the past. In September of 1940,

21
00:01:26.271 --> 00:01:28.610
an 18 year old mechanic named Marcel,

22
00:01:28.611 --> 00:01:33.470
Ravi Dodd was walking his dog robot in the countryside of Southwestern France.

23
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.610
When the dog disappeared, done a whole robot eventually returned,

24
00:01:37.611 --> 00:01:38.421
but the next day,

25
00:01:38.421 --> 00:01:42.260
Ravi duck went to the spot with three friends to explore the hole.

26
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.390
And after quite a bit of digging,

27
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.620
they discovered a cave with walls covered with paintings,

28
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.970
including over 900 paintings of animals, horses,

29
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.570
stags, bison, and also species that are now extinct,

30
00:01:56.571 --> 00:01:58.370
including a wooly rhinoceros.

31
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.020
The paintings were astonishingly detailed and vivid with red, yellow,

32
00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:07.760
and black paint made from pulverized mineral pigments that were usually blown

33
00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:09.200
through a narrow tube,

34
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.040
possibly a hollowed bone onto the walls of the cave.

35
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.170
It would eventually be established that these artworks were at least 17,000

36
00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:19.070
years old.

37
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.350
Two of the boys who visited the cave that day were so profoundly moved by the

38
00:02:24.351 --> 00:02:29.210
art. They saw that they camped outside the cave to protect it for

39
00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:32.360
over a year after world war two,

40
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.290
the French government took over protection of the site and the cave was open to

41
00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:38.060
the public in 1948.

42
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.770
When Picasso saw the cave paintings on a visit that year, he reportedly said,

43
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.270
we have invented nothing. There are many mysteries at Lesco.

44
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.510
Why for instance, are there no paintings of reindeer,

45
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.560
which we know were the primary source of food for the paleolithic humans who

46
00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:55.820
lived in that cave?

47
00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.490
Why were they so much more focused on painting animals than human forms?

48
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.850
Why are certain areas of the cave filled with images,

49
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:07.750
including pictures on the ceiling that required the building of scaffolding to

50
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:12.170
create while other areas have only a few paintings and were the paintings

51
00:03:12.171 --> 00:03:16.360
spiritual here are our sacred animals, or were they practical?

52
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.540
Here is a guide to some of the animals that might kill you.

53
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.150
Aside from the animals. There are nearly a thousand abstract signs and shapes.

54
00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:26.500
We cannot interpret.

55
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.870
And also several negative hand stencils as they are known by art historians.

56
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.630
These are the paintings that most interest me.

57
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.050
They were created by pressing one hand with fingers,

58
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:41.770
splayed against the wall of the cave, and then blowing pigment,

59
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.060
leaving the area around the hand, painted similar hand,

60
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:50.500
stencils have been found in caves around the world from Indonesia to

61
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:54.910
Spain, to Australia, to the Americas, to Africa,

62
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.740
we have found these memories of hands from 15 or 30 or

63
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:02.020
even 40,000 years ago.

64
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.150
These hand stencils remind us of how different life was in the distant past.

65
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.660
Amputations, likely from frostbite are common in Europe.

66
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.550
And so you often see negative hand stencils with three or four fingers and life

67
00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:20.440
was short and difficult. As many as a quarter of women died in childbirth,

68
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.580
around 50% of children died before the age of five,

69
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.820
but they also remind us that the humans of the past were as human as we

70
00:04:29.821 --> 00:04:34.230
are their hands indistinguishable from ours

71
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.300
communities hunted and gathered. And there were no large caloric surpluses.

72
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.220
So every healthy person would have had to contribute to the acquisition of food

73
00:04:44.221 --> 00:04:45.054
and water.

74
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.770
And yet somehow they still made time to create art

75
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.880
almost as if art isn't optional for humans.

76
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.100
We see all kinds of hands stenciled on cave, walls, children and adults,

77
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.050
but almost always the fingers are spread like my kid's hand stencils.

78
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.840
I'm no youngian, but it's fascinating.

79
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.220
And a little strange that so many paleolithic humans who couldn't

80
00:05:11.221 --> 00:05:15.630
possibly have had any contact with each other created the same paintings,

81
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.580
the same way paintings that we are still making. But then again,

82
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.560
what the Lesko art means to me is likely very different from what it meant

83
00:05:25.561 --> 00:05:28.440
to the people who made it. Some academics,

84
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.770
theorized that the hand stencils were part of funding rituals.

85
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.940
Then there's always the possibility that the hand was just a convenient model

86
00:05:35.941 --> 00:05:39.360
situated at the end of the wrist. To me though,

87
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.350
the hand stencils that Vesco say I was here.

88
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.440
They say you are not new.

89
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.940
And because they are negative prints surrounded by red pigment.

90
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.630
They also look to me like something out of a horror movie,

91
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.240
like ghostly hands reaching up from some bloody background.

92
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.400
They remind me that as Alice Walker wrote all history is

93
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:09.050
current. The Lascaux cave has been closed to the public for many years now,

94
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.060
too many contemporary humans breathing inside of it led to the growth of mold

95
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.940
and lichens, which is damaged. Some of the art,

96
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.780
just the act of looking at something can ruin it, I guess,

97
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.270
but tourists can still visit an imitation cave called Glasgow two

98
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.250
in which the artwork has been meticulously, recreated humans,

99
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.890
making fake cave art to save real cave.

100
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:37.340
Art may feel like peak Anthropocene behavior,

101
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.450
but I have to confess that even though I am a jaded and cynical

102
00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:44.030
semi-professional reviewer of human activity,

103
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.400
I actually find it overwhelmingly hopeful that four teenagers and a dog

104
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:54.140
named robot discovered a cave with 17,000 year old hand prints

105
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.910
that the cave was so overwhelmingly beautiful that two of those teenagers

106
00:06:58.911 --> 00:07:01.100
devoted themselves to its protection.

107
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.300
And that when we humans became a danger to that, Kate's beauty,

108
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.410
we agreed to stop going. Lesco is there.

109
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.640
You cannot visit. You can go to the fake cave.

110
00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:17.120
We've built and see nearly identical hand stencils,

111
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.230
but you will know this is not the thing itself,

112
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.220
but a shadow of it. This is a handprint,

113
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.260
but not a hand.

114
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.100
This is a memory that you cannot return to.

115
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.530
All of which makes the cave very much like the past it represents.

116
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.370
<v 0>We hope you enjoyed this video, even if it was different.</v>

117
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.320
Check out John Green's podcast,

118
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.470
the Anthropocene reviewed where he poetically reviews.

119
00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:54.880
The human world we live in John is a good friend of course, cause ours. In fact,

120
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.230
without his channel crash course that he and his brother Hank started years ago.

121
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.490
Coats cause art would not exist because it was the original inspiration for what

122
00:08:03.491 --> 00:08:06.400
we do today. And over the years,

123
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.100
John and Hank have helped us in a multitude of ways,

124
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:11.530
from advice to just being friends.

125
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.330
So check out the Anthropocene reviewed or any of their many channels.
