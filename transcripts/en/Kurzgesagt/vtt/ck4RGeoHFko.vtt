00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 0>Humans are proud of a lot of things from particle accelerators to poetry,</v>

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.503
to Pokemon,

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.650
all of them may possible because of something humans value extremely highly

4
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.900
intelligence. We think of intelligence as a trait like height or strength.

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.100
But when we try to define this things, get fuzzy. In a nutshell,

6
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.710
intelligence is a mechanism to solve problems,

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.140
especially the problem of staying alive,

8
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.910
which involves finding food and shelter fighting sexual competitors or flame

9
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.330
from predators. Intelligence is not a single thing.

10
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.390
It includes the ability to gather knowledge, to learn,

11
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.070
be creative form strategies, or engage in critical thinking.

12
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.410
It manifests itself in a huge variety of behaviors from a

13
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.150
hardwired or instinct like reactions to different degrees of learning to some

14
00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:52.200
sort of awareness,

15
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.970
but not all scientists agree where it begins or what even should count as

16
00:00:56.971 --> 00:00:59.730
intelligence to make this even more complicated.

17
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.710
Intelligence is also connected to consciousness sense awareness is helpful for

18
00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:08.340
problem solving, but we're exploring consciousness in other videos.

19
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.580
So today we'll leave it aside. Okay.

20
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.280
Intelligence isn't exactly. Clear-cut.

21
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.600
So maybe we can think of it as more Nike flexible set of skills,

22
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.930
toolbox basic tools with the most basic

23
00:01:23.931 --> 00:01:28.190
tools in the intelligence toolbox are the ability to gather information to save

24
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.300
is, and to use it,

25
00:01:29.301 --> 00:01:33.980
to learn information about the world is gathered through senses such as

26
00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:37.130
vision sound, smell, touch, or taste,

27
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.900
and helps us navigate and react to the external world appropriately.

28
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.100
But living things also need to keep track of the state of their own bodies,

29
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.560
monitoring things like hunger and fatigue

30
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.360
information is the basis of action for all living things.

31
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.480
And without it you're at the mercy of your surroundings,

32
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.490
unable to react appropriately or flexibly information is much more

33
00:02:01.491 --> 00:02:06.170
powerful if we can keep and save it. So the second tool is memory.

34
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.010
Memory is the ability to save and recall information.

35
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.790
So a living being doesn't have to start from scratch every time it perceives

36
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.780
something relevant memories can be about events, places,

37
00:02:17.781 --> 00:02:22.250
and associations, but also behaviors like hunting or foraging methods.

38
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.410
Some of these like flying have to be repeated over and over until they're

39
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.253
mastered.

40
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.780
This is what we call learning the process of putting together a sequence of

41
00:02:32.781 --> 00:02:33.770
thoughts or actions,

42
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.570
basically a string of repeatable behaviors that can be varied and adapted.

43
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.550
These three tools enable seemingly stupid creatures to act in

44
00:02:43.551 --> 00:02:48.380
surprisingly intelligent ways. The, a cellular slow mold,

45
00:02:48.381 --> 00:02:53.240
which is basically just a single huge slimy cell shows behavior similar to an

46
00:02:53.241 --> 00:02:57.410
animal with a simple brain when put in a maze with food at one end,

47
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.960
the slime mold explores surroundings and marks its path with slime trails,

48
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.700
sort of smearing memories on the ground, as it continues,

49
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:10.660
exploring it avoids the Mt pathways and finds its way to the food.

50
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.760
Instead of blindly getting stuck in dead ends the slime mold adapts its behavior

51
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.230
to save time and effort.

52
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.750
This behavior is hardwired and scientists can't agree if that's intelligent,

53
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.660
although it does give the slime mold a certain advantage.

54
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.440
These are an example of more adaptive,

55
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:34.030
smart behavior scientists trained bumblebees to move a colored ball into a

56
00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:37.180
goalpost for a sugar award. Not only with the bees,

57
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:39.850
very skillful at this behavior, which isn't natural to them.

58
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.810
They got more efficient over time. When several balls were available,

59
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.420
B's chose the ball that they closest to the goal.

60
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.360
Even if it was a different color than the ball, they were trained with

61
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.440
challenging problems. We need even more flexibility,

62
00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.000
fancier tools building on the basic tools.

63
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.810
More complex animals have a wider range of problems they can solve.

64
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.120
They can memorize all kinds of associations, connections and mechanical tricks.

65
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.230
We'll call this tool. The library of knowledge take raccoons.

66
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.140
Their favorite kind of food is human food.

67
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.310
Their approach to getting hold of such treats depends upon an assortment of

68
00:04:20.311 --> 00:04:24.120
theoretical and practical skills that makes them master burglars,

69
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.110
able to open windows or pet locks in a study.

70
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.070
Raccoons were given boxes secured with different kinds of logs like latches

71
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.110
bolts plugs or push bars they need.

72
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.370
Is it less than 10 attempts to figure out how to open each box?

73
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.270
Even when different locks were put together into increasingly difficult

74
00:04:42.271 --> 00:04:46.260
combinations that had to be solved in the right order and with different amounts

75
00:04:46.261 --> 00:04:51.030
of strength. A year later, the raccoons still remembered how to open the boxes.

76
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.100
And whereas as fast as when they had solve the puzzle beyond the hour

77
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.230
library of associations and skills,

78
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.530
the most impressive tool in our box is creativity.

79
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.930
This sort of mental ducks tape being creative means producing

80
00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:11.070
something new and valuable from apparently unrelated things.

81
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.500
In the context of intelligence, this means making new and unusual connections,

82
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.570
pairing input with memories and skills to come up with a unique solution to a

83
00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:24.480
problem in another Akuna study.

84
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.230
Researchers showed the animals that by dropping pebbles into a water tank,

85
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.800
they could raise the water level enough to reach a marshmallow floating at the

86
00:05:31.801 --> 00:05:34.980
top one, raccoon came up with a much better solution.

87
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.020
It tipped the tub over another facet of creativity is applying a new

88
00:05:40.021 --> 00:05:44.910
resource to a task physical tools like primates that use sticks

89
00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:48.120
to fish for termites in trees or some octopuses,

90
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.410
which assemble collected coconut shells around themselves as a sort of portable

91
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.970
armor to hide from enemies.

92
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.880
Collecting materials for later use is connected to an even more advanced

93
00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:01.130
dimension of problem-solving planning.

94
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.230
Planning means considering the activities required for a desired goal and

95
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:10.670
putting them together in a plan when unforeseen circumstances and new

96
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:12.260
possibilities present themselves,

97
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.560
they need to be assessed according to whether they match the plan or not.

98
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.000
An example of this intelligent behavior is hoarding food to eat it later.

99
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.150
This is an instinctive behavior in squirrels,

100
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.510
but even though hiding food comes instinctively to them,

101
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.440
they still need to use advanced thinking skills to make the best decisions

102
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.970
squirrels examine every night and weigh the time and effort it would take to

103
00:06:34.971 --> 00:06:39.650
hide it against the benefits they would get from each one damaged or low fat

104
00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:43.550
nuts are eaten right away while nuts that still need to ripen go on the

105
00:06:43.551 --> 00:06:44.384
stockpile.

106
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.850
Squirrels also pretend to bury nuts when they feel watched these empty

107
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.790
caches distract rivals from their real treasure.

108
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.560
This is pretty advanced strategizing because to make a plan to distract someone

109
00:06:57.561 --> 00:06:57.980
else,

110
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.400
you first have to be aware that there are others like you that want the same

111
00:07:01.401 --> 00:07:04.340
things, the more complex, the problem,

112
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.520
the more tools are needed in combination to solve it.

113
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.050
So the more tools there are,

114
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:13.220
the more flexibility of being has to solve the challenges life throws at them,

115
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.800
but even for complex problems,

116
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.060
each animal's individual situation is what counts.

117
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:24.070
Squirrels are omnivores that defend their territories fiercely for them.

118
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.210
It makes sense to remember where there's food and different locations and trick

119
00:07:28.211 --> 00:07:30.550
that animals to improve their chances of survival.

120
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.620
Sheep don't have any such refined tricks up their sleeve that they don't need

121
00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:38.620
to. They are grazers and live in flocks.

122
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.290
The skills relevant to them are social.

123
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.850
They recognize and remember many different sheep and even humans for years,

124
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.130
a completely different skill evolving and retaining a complex set of mental

125
00:07:51.131 --> 00:07:54.460
abilities. They might never use would be a waste of resources for them.

126
00:07:55.690 --> 00:08:00.550
Humans went the opposite way and invested in an unusually diverse intelligence

127
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.790
toolkits. While this was helpful by accident,

128
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.880
we added another set of tools on top culture.

129
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.800
No single person could ever build a space rocket or particle accelerator,

130
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:16.120
but thanks to our ability to work together and to share knowledge across

131
00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:16.954
generations,

132
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:21.160
we can overcome challenges beyond any single individual's ability.

133
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.340
This allowed us to shape the planet to our liking.

134
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.810
We also created new problems in the process, Sudoku tax forms,

135
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:29.853
string theory,

136
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:35.290
but also rapid climate change and antibiotic resistance to solve

137
00:08:35.291 --> 00:08:39.910
these we'll need to look past short term survival and think about the distant

138
00:08:39.911 --> 00:08:44.290
future. We have the toolbox, we just need to use it.

139
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:48.520
Speeding. Speaking. You have tools for learning.

140
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:52.480
We've heard from many teachers that are using our infographic posters in class.

141
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:57.300
So we asked what would help them most and made an education edition for

142
00:08:57.301 --> 00:08:59.490
teachers, students, and everyone else.

143
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:04.020
There slightly larger posters about various things that will expand over time

144
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.740
from a periodic table to a world map or the human body.

145
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.190
You can get them in our shop and support us if you want.

146
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.450
And let us know which post topics you want for your room or classroom.

147
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:20.550
This video was part two of a three-part video series relating to big questions

148
00:09:20.551 --> 00:09:22.860
of life and the universe made possible.

149
00:09:22.861 --> 00:09:25.890
Thanks to a grant from the Templeton world charity foundation,

150
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:29.790
you'll find our sources and further reading in the video description.
