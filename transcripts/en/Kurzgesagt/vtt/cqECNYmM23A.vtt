00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.500
<v 0>In nearly every corner of the earth. And so wage war against each other,</v>

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.790
their weapons are what nature gave them. Some have strong armor,

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.400
deadly stingers or sharp mandibles.

4
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.210
And then there's this tiny and not very impressive ant,

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.610
but it rules the biggest empire.

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.530
Any aunt has ever built a cottony spanning continents and fighting

7
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:24.840
Wars that leave millions of casualties.

8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.610
Let's take a look at this unlikely warrior S then epitomized Humanae,

9
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.080
the Argentina hat.

10
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.610
This story begins in the floodplains around the paranoia river in South America.

11
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.860
It's a crowded and megalopolis where dozens of ant species fight for

12
00:00:51.861 --> 00:00:54.710
dominance, including fire ants, army ants,

13
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.780
and that rather unimpressive Argentina at it measures only two to three

14
00:00:59.781 --> 00:01:02.660
millimeters in length. And with its small mandibles,

15
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.380
it's surprising that it's survived among its buff competitors.

16
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.630
That homes are equally unremarkable their colonies range from fairly small to

17
00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:16.400
very large and could be found anywhere under logs in loose leaf litter

18
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.730
or the former colonies of other ads here.

19
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.930
Argentina ants prepare their most effective weapon against their competitors.

20
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.003
Bodies.

21
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.050
Most ant species have only one queen to produce ants while Argentine

22
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.670
ants went all in on numbers for every 120 workers.

23
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.820
There's one queen laying up to 60 eggs a day.

24
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.010
So that is grow fast and have millions or billions of

25
00:01:43.011 --> 00:01:43.844
individuals,

26
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.280
teams of Queens and workers frequently branch out and found new colonies.

27
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.530
But their strategy has a downside as colonies grow and produce a lot of

28
00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:59.270
offspring mutations occur and new colonies adapt to new environments that

29
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.830
DNA slowly changes from generation to generation and differences accumulator.

30
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.450
So after awhile,

31
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.740
the ants that left the colony will become more like a distant cousins and start

32
00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:14.300
to compete with their mother economy and their native South American range.

33
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.590
This is how Argentine ants behave within that colonies.

34
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.170
They are very co-operative and well-organized,

35
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.180
but they fight vicious Wars against other Argentine and colonies and other and

36
00:02:26.181 --> 00:02:29.750
species with equally strong opponents. On every side,

37
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.520
the Argentine ants became extremely aggressive fighting for every inch of

38
00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:39.170
ground, but it could never dominate its neighbors until humans showed up.

39
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.290
We did what humans do and transported things around the world by ship on one of

40
00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:47.780
them, a few Argentina and Queens hitched,

41
00:02:47.781 --> 00:02:51.560
a rider's stowaways from South America to Madeira and new Orleans.

42
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.630
The Argentina suddenly found themselves in a strange world.

43
00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.690
Instead of being surrounded by deadly enemies, they found only victims.

44
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.810
Nobody could find them effectively because only a few Argentina and

45
00:03:06.811 --> 00:03:09.060
Queens were introduced to the outside world.

46
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.010
The resulting colonies had very low genetic diversity on top of that,

47
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.390
the introduced Argentine ants can up to 90% of their Queens every year,

48
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.480
fewer Queens, less genetic variation.

49
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.870
So as these colonies spread across the landscape,

50
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.640
aunts that left the colony were no longer considered distant cousins as a

51
00:03:29.641 --> 00:03:33.150
result, the new colonies form, not opposing,

52
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.690
but cooperating parties called super colonies.

53
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.590
This is a very uncommon strategy in the United Kingdom.

54
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.300
Only a few of the 16,000 ant species have evolved super colonies.

55
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.520
A super colony was established on the West coast of the USA and became a base

56
00:03:50.521 --> 00:03:53.970
for the tiny ants global conquest today,

57
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.590
the Argentine and inhabits the Mediterranean zones of six continents and many

58
00:03:58.591 --> 00:03:59.424
islands.

59
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.440
This one super colony was especially successful establishing sister locations in

60
00:04:04.441 --> 00:04:06.600
California, Europe, Japan,

61
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.790
New Zealand and Australia forming one massive Intercontinental mega colony

62
00:04:11.791 --> 00:04:16.050
of Argentine ends. This makes them the largest society on earth,

63
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.060
more numerous than even the human one, but their success has changed.

64
00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:22.890
The ecosystems they invaded.

65
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.680
California is a perfect example of this in that greed for more territory,

66
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.660
the invading Argentine ants have overrun and replaced 90% of the native

67
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.920
and species, including several species of California in the carpenter ants.

68
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.130
Although carpenter and workers are giants.

69
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.470
Their colonies have only between 3000 and 6,000 individuals and stand no

70
00:04:46.471 --> 00:04:50.610
chance against an expanding super colony of billions of Argentineans

71
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.620
Argentine ant workers attack by wiping toxic chemicals on their victims,

72
00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.480
which irritates the enemy and marks them as a target for other Argentine ads.

73
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.440
When they attack the Argentine ants wash over their victims,

74
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.340
clinging onto their opponents in groups and pulling apart their lives.

75
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.000
It doesn't matter how many of them die. There are always more.

76
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.420
Once the colony is overrun and exterminated,

77
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.860
the Argentine ants feed them that victims bruise and take over their home and

78
00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:20.694
territory.

79
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.740
The tiny ants numbers allow them to hunt down and devour such an excessive,

80
00:05:25.741 --> 00:05:26.191
massive,

81
00:05:26.191 --> 00:05:30.240
different insects that over time some species do as a peer from the ants

82
00:05:30.241 --> 00:05:30.751
territory,

83
00:05:30.751 --> 00:05:35.460
completely Argentine ants don't care about working with the local flora and

84
00:05:35.461 --> 00:05:38.220
fauna. They consume them and move on.

85
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.700
And if their next job happens to be human property,

86
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.220
they will rudely make themselves at home there too.

87
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.260
They forage in dumpsters bowls of pet food and sneak into kitchens to claim

88
00:05:49.261 --> 00:05:51.660
leftovers, not just our homes,

89
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.440
our gardens and fields are also acted by, by finance.

90
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.250
Since they tend to hoards of aphids as their cattle,

91
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.880
the aphids feed from plants and produce a sweet honeydew,

92
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.950
which they trade with the ants for protection.

93
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.760
Since the ants have no major enemy to fair in their new homes,

94
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.450
the aphids thrive and ultimately kill the plants they live on.

95
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.100
So on top of being a major disruption for the ecosystems, they invade,

96
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.310
they are also a huge past for agriculture,

97
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.570
but the rule of the Argentina is being challenged.

98
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.370
Parts of the super colonies have broken off and become their own empires.

99
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.390
A merciless civil war has broken out. For example,

100
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.680
the Lake Hodges super colony has been fighting against the very large colony for

101
00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:41.630
years in San Diego County. A massive war is going on over eight dynamic,

102
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.970
frontline stretching over kilometers,

103
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.190
an estimated 30 million ants die here each year on other fronts,

104
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.690
an old acquaintance from the Paranal river has risen from the shadows red

105
00:06:53.691 --> 00:06:55.010
imported fire ants,

106
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.180
which were accidentally introduced from their old home to the coast of Alabama.

107
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.480
Not only other red fire ants, fierce fighters,

108
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.550
and more than able to deal with the Argentine.

109
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.910
And they are also able to form super colonies themselves.

110
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.710
Now the old Wars from their distant home have been taken to a foreign

111
00:07:12.711 --> 00:07:15.620
battleground in the Southeastern us,

112
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.240
the super colonies clashed fiercely the Argentina found themselves

113
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.920
outgunned by the fire ants.

114
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.630
The fire ants major workers are more than twice the size of the Argentines and

115
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.400
wield venom injecting stairs.

116
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.810
Even though the Argentine ands fought fiercely the firearms were too much for

117
00:07:32.811 --> 00:07:37.610
them after countless lost battles, the red imported fire and exterminated,

118
00:07:37.611 --> 00:07:41.330
the Argentine ants super colony from much of the Southeastern us.

119
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.700
This is one territory lost,

120
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.470
but the Argentine ants will fight on this amazing network of cooperating.

121
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.440
Super colonies is the biggest success in their history.

122
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.260
And they'll not give it up because of a small.

123
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.450
<v 1>Defeat. They will stand their.</v>
