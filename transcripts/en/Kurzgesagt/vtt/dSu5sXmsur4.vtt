00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.220
<v 0>By the end of the 21st century,</v>

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.170
humanity is becoming desperate decades of heat waves and droughts have

3
00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:11.880
led to unusually poor harvest while the warming oceans yield fewer fish each

4
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:13.980
year in the tropical zones,

5
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.390
millions suffer from famines and resource Wars have made millions more flee to

6
00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:22.650
the North. As things quickly get worse in an act of desperation,

7
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.950
the world's governments decide to enact an emergency plan.

8
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.000
It's far from certain that a grim scenario like this will play out,

9
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.080
but the failure of world leaders to effectively address climate change makes it

10
00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:36.990
far from impossible. So in the near future,

11
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.690
it might become necessary to try something radical,

12
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.730
to slow down rapid climate change,

13
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.060
geoengineering interventions.

14
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.440
So massive in scale that they might undo centuries of human behavior

15
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.760
or make everything much worse. What is geoengineering?

16
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.830
Is it really an option? And what have you.

17
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:56.783
<v 1>Goes wrong?</v>

18
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.280
<v 0>Geoengineering methods vary from fantastic ones like constructing giant light</v>

19
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.350
sails in space to seeding clouds with salt or Wilder ones like fertilizing the

20
00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:19.040
oceans with iron to speed up the growth of trillions of algae cells.

21
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.540
In this video,

22
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.310
we'll focus on an intervention we could see during our lifetimes stratospheric,

23
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.190
aerosol injection, a clunky term.

24
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.210
That means that the spring stuff very high up in the atmosphere to keep the sun

25
00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:33.044
away,

26
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.880
keeping the sun away CO2 doesn't heat up the planet on its own.

27
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.270
Almost all of the energy on earth comes from the sun in the fall of

28
00:01:41.271 --> 00:01:42.740
electromagnetic radiation.

29
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.410
About 71% of this energy is absorbed by the earth surface and atmosphere.

30
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.230
This absorbed energy is emitted again,

31
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.000
as infrared radiation and CO2 is able to trap this infrared

32
00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:58.640
radiation and keep it in the atmosphere for awhile.

33
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.360
You can compare this effect with snuggling under a blanket in the morning,

34
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.130
even in a really cold room,

35
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.030
your body emits infrared radiation and the air between your body and the

36
00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:11.330
blankets trap says and creates a warm and comfy feeling.

37
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.040
So one way to call down the panic would be to prevent energy from getting

38
00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:17.990
trapped under our planet blanket,

39
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.210
which is already happening naturally about 29% of the solar radiation

40
00:02:23.211 --> 00:02:28.130
hitting earth is reflected back to space by bright surfaces, like ice deserts,

41
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.270
snow or clouds, more reflection, less energy,

42
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.433
less warming.

43
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.020
We can look at nature for inspiration specifically the 1991 Mount

44
00:02:39.021 --> 00:02:43.460
Pinatubo eruption. The second largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century,

45
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.890
aside from massive devastation and almost 900 dead scientists noted its

46
00:02:48.891 --> 00:02:50.780
strong impact on the global climate.

47
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.880
The explosion objected millions of tons of particles and gas as high as the

48
00:02:55.881 --> 00:02:58.220
stratosphere, which hung around there for a while.

49
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.500
The that's interesting for geoengineering is Salford ArcSight,

50
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.580
a nasty smelling and invisible gas high in the atmosphere.

51
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.650
It produced a haze of sulfuric acid droplets that mix with water and created

52
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.330
giant veils. These veils reduced the sunlight reaching earth surface.

53
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.060
<v 2>By roughly 1% global.</v>

54
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.540
<v 0>Average temperatures dropped by 0.5 degrees Celsius.</v>

55
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.050
It took three years until this cooling effect had stopped.

56
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.840
Humans could imitate this process by injecting self articles directly into the

57
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:34.450
stratosphere. According to some scientists,

58
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.610
this might be surprisingly easy to do,

59
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.140
and we don't even need a lot of new technology for it. According to one study,

60
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.700
it also might be pretty cheap compared with the costs of rapid climate change.

61
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.740
A small fleet of specialized aircraft could ascend once a year and distribute

62
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:54.460
aerosols along the equator from where they would be spread around the world.

63
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.260
Projections assumed that injecting between five and eight megatons of material

64
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:04.030
per year would reflect enough sunlight to slow down or even stop global warming.

65
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.450
Giving us precious time to transition the way from.

66
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.940
<v 2>Fossil fuels. Unfortunately.</v>

67
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.770
<v 0>There might be a few unhappy side-effects there are a number of potential</v>

68
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:18.520
issues with aerosol injections. Rainfall patterns could change,

69
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.110
which could negatively affect agriculture and cause famine billions of people

70
00:04:23.111 --> 00:04:24.880
could be affected in the worst case.

71
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.720
Also after the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption,

72
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.140
the acid water veils not only cooled down the surface,

73
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.910
they also heated up the stratosphere as it turns out as it is bad for the

74
00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:41.770
ozone layer and the ozone hole over Antarctica was the largest it has ever been

75
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.390
injecting. Sulfur particles over decades could have a similar effect.

76
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.950
The scientists have already suggested using a combination of different minerals

77
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.770
that might have much less harmful effects on the ozone layer,

78
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.670
but more research and experiments need to be done to make sure this could work,

79
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.960
but even if we don't damage the ozone layer, there are other risks.

80
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.180
Politicians and industry might use the cooling effect as an excuse to delay the

81
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:08.890
switch to a carbon neutral economy.

82
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.460
Even if geo engineering slows down global warming,

83
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.850
humanity is still adding extra CO2 to the atmosphere.

84
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.170
More CO2 in the air means that the oceans absorb more CO2,

85
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.640
which makes them more acidic.

86
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.560
This is already beginning to be deadly to huge ecosystems like coral reefs.

87
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.980
And the longer this continues, the more severe the effects will be.

88
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.380
<v 2>But it gets worse. Once.</v>

89
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.590
<v 0>We start pumping particles into the atmosphere on a massive scale,</v>

90
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.990
we might be forced to do so for a long time,

91
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.420
or we could risk eight termination shock.

92
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.370
What that means is that if humanity continues to enrich the atmosphere with CO2,

93
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.730
but at the same time prevents the planet from heating up by blocking solar

94
00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:53.230
radiation. We're sitting on a time bomb. Once we stop geoengineering,

95
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.470
the natural cycle will take over again and earth would heat up.

96
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.200
But after a few decades of keeping the planet artificially cold,

97
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.010
while still releasing massive amounts of CO2, it would heat up much,

98
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:04.844
much quicker.

99
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.320
An increase in temperature that would take 50 years today could happen in just

100
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:10.154
10 years.

101
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.720
Such a temperature shock in such a short time would disrupt every major system

102
00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:18.350
on earth so much that it would be impossible to adapt in time.

103
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.880
The worst case scenario could be dramatic famines and the rapid destruction of

104
00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:25.820
ecosystems humanity might survive,

105
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.960
but the survivors would inhabit an unfamiliar and hostile world.

106
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.910
The best case scenario is that once the world has finally fully understood the

107
00:06:34.911 --> 00:06:37.160
existential danger of rapid climate change,

108
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.770
geoengineering can bias a crucial decade or two time to transition era economies

109
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.740
and maybe even pull CO2 out of the atmosphere.

110
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.890
Maybe with technologies that we'll discuss in a future video conclusion,

111
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:56.650
geoengineering is a scary concept. It's not a solution to climate change,

112
00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.760
and it might even be a welcome excuse for the fossil fuel industry to delay the

113
00:07:00.761 --> 00:07:04.090
end of the fossil fuel age over the last few decades,

114
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.380
geoengineering has been so controversial that it stopped many scientists from

115
00:07:08.381 --> 00:07:11.080
doing the experiments necessary to understand it better.

116
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.070
But blankly opposing geoengineering is short-sighted.

117
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.260
The sad truth is we are already running a geo engineering experiment where

118
00:07:20.261 --> 00:07:24.010
testing how fast the world changes. If we add about 40 billion,

119
00:07:24.011 --> 00:07:25.690
tons of CO2 each year,

120
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.050
this experiment is about to get really exciting.

121
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.710
Hopefully we'll never have to use geoengineering,

122
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:36.760
but if we need to in the future, we better have done the science.

123
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:42.310
We better be prepared or a panicking humanity might

124
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.400
accidentally press the self-destruct button.

125
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.410
You probably won't have to do any of that yourself,

126
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:55.480
but who knows better brush up on your science knowledge just in case and our

127
00:07:55.481 --> 00:07:57.610
friends at brilliant can help you with that.
