00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.900
<v 0>Things a space is hard right now.</v>

2
00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:08.700
It's like going up a mountain on a unicycle with a backpack full of explosives,

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.020
incredibly slow. You can't transport a lot of stuff and you might die.

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.630
A rocket needs to reach a velocity of about 40,000 kilometers now to escape

5
00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:23.520
from earth to get to that speed rockets are mostly containers for fuel,

6
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.820
with a tiny tip of payload. This is bad.

7
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:30.510
If you want to go to other planets because you need a lot of heavy stuff,

8
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.720
if you want to survive and maybe even come back.

9
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.550
So is there a way to get a space with less fuel and more payload?

10
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.503
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

11
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.210
<v 0>The thing that sold most of our transport problems on earth is what you call</v>

12
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.020
infrastructure. Whether it's roads for cars, ports for ships,

13
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.740
all rails for trains, we've made it easier to get to places.

14
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.270
We can apply the same solution to space travel space.

15
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.570
Infrastructure will make getting into orbit and out to the moon,

16
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.680
Mars and beyond easier and cheaper. Great.

17
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.840
But what exactly is space infrastructure? Unlike an earth space elevator,

18
00:01:17.841 --> 00:01:19.400
which is currently science fiction,

19
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.230
that is a simple yet promising technology that does not require new

20
00:01:24.231 --> 00:01:27.290
science, magic materials or huge investments.

21
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.480
And that has been tested successfully in orbit already cable and await,

22
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.470
known as a tether. The concept is so simple.

23
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.240
It's surprising what if we put tethers hundreds or thousands of kilometers

24
00:01:41.241 --> 00:01:45.890
long into space and had spacecraft to use them as ladders to climb to higher out

25
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.880
Judes and gain.

26
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.520
<v 1>Speed. This concept.</v>

27
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.720
<v 0>Is known as the sky hook. It works even better. If we make it spin,</v>

28
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.950
the counterweight holds a long cable in place while it rotates around a circle,

29
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.660
a rotating tether slows down its tip relative to the ground to the bottom and

30
00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:04.670
speeds it up at the top. Like a catapult.

31
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.440
This means that you can transfer energy from the tether and get a massive boost

32
00:02:09.441 --> 00:02:12.500
when released more or less for free, equal to twice.

33
00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:14.030
The tethers rotation velocity,

34
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.810
the specialized fibers already exist that can survive.

35
00:02:17.811 --> 00:02:22.190
The extraordinary stresses a sky hook would be faced with to protect against

36
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.620
cuts and collisions from debris and meteorites.

37
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.800
We can thread our together into a web of redundant fibers.

38
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.940
Since our sky hook would pass over the same spot. Many times a day,

39
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.440
this would allow small reusable shuttles to catch up with it. Of course,

40
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.140
it's not that easy at its lowest point.

41
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.920
The tellers tip is dashing through the atmosphere at around 12,000 kilometers

42
00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:47.090
per hour because of Earth's atmosphere. We can't low the sky hook too much,

43
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.040
or it will get too hot from Africa.

44
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.830
So it will dip to a height of 80 to 150 kilometers and no lower to

45
00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:55.101
match.

46
00:02:55.101 --> 00:02:59.590
This will need specialized space trough that can get to the tether while this

47
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.850
isn't exactly easy.

48
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.170
It's still much cheaper than getting a big tin can filled with rocket fuel to go

49
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:09.430
40,000 kilometers an hour catching the tip will be a challenge too.

50
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.650
There's only a short time window of 60 to 90 seconds to find a tiny thing in the

51
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:18.550
sky. Moving at Mark 12, to make this easier.

52
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.090
The tip could have a sort of fishing line that a kilometer long with a

53
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:24.760
navigation drone that helps the spacecraft connect.

54
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.950
Another challenge is keeping our sky hook in obese as more and more ships latch

55
00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:33.910
onto it and pull themselves up. They use up the momentum that keeps it in place.

56
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.430
If we don't do anything, it will slow down and crash into the atmosphere. Yeah.

57
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.000
And here we can cheat the universe of bet.

58
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.630
The sky hook is a battery of orbital energy.

59
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.820
It's possible to the payloads coming in and being sent off arriving

60
00:03:50.821 --> 00:03:54.990
ships, bringing humans and materials home to earth, add energy to the tether,

61
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.870
which it can give to other ships departing into space.

62
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.100
This way the tether doesn't lose any energy. The more we use it,

63
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.360
the cheaper it gets. If we're still losing energy with each boost,

64
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.110
we can recover it with smaller electric or chemical engines that regularly

65
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.460
correct the tethers position,

66
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.080
a set of Tavers one around earth and one around Mars could make trips between

67
00:04:16.081 --> 00:04:19.890
the planets fast, straightforward, and low cost competitors rockets.

68
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.270
The earth tether would sit in low earth orbit to grab people in payloads and

69
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.380
fling them off to Mars.

70
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.020
Whoever catches them and slows them down for a landing on the surface in the

71
00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:33.390
opposite direction. The tether could pick up the vehicle.

72
00:04:33.391 --> 00:04:37.710
Traveling through Mars is thin atmosphere at only about 1000 kilometers an hour.

73
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.180
Not much faster than our airliners on earth and fling it back to earth to be

74
00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:43.350
caught and lower down.

75
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.150
The tethers could shorten trips between both pennants from nine months down to

76
00:04:48.151 --> 00:04:49.350
five or even three,

77
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.510
and reduce the scale of the rockets required by between 84 and 96 X percent.

78
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.273
Even better.

79
00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.480
People be able to travel in a relative luxury as we could afford to invest in

80
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.770
passenger comfort. Tether travel would be first-class seats to Mars,

81
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.600
tethers around earth and Mars could provide the rapid and cost efficient

82
00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:12.960
transportation backbone that would make space travel affordable,

83
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.890
but let's go further. Start from low Mars or risk.

84
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.350
A tether could boost ships to the asteroid belt.

85
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.640
The first craft sent to a new asteroid would need rockets to slow down at its

86
00:05:23.641 --> 00:05:24.474
destination.

87
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.650
Subsequent arrivals might find a tether waiting to catch them and send them back

88
00:05:28.651 --> 00:05:31.200
for free. Getting to asteroids.

89
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.310
Cheaply is a major factor in opening up the resources of the solar system.

90
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.690
Precious metals and valuable minerals could be delivered to Mars just weeks

91
00:05:39.691 --> 00:05:41.580
after they were cut out of their asteroid.

92
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.630
They would be the perfect building blocks for our interplanetary similar

93
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.460
ization, but why stop here? Mars moons are very convenient,

94
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.120
no other moons in the solar system orbit that close to that planet.

95
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.670
The Phobos is so heavy that we don't need worry about slowing it down,

96
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.700
making it the perfect attachment point for super tethers,

97
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:03.890
just under 6,000 kilometers long,

98
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.630
the lower tip would fly just over the surface of Mars and be very easy to catch

99
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.740
the upper tip can fling ships all the way to Jupiter and Saturn.

100
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.150
The same super tether can also bring the inner solar system closer.

101
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.690
Venus and mercury are a single swing away.

102
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.030
Unlike Mars they're bursting with soda energy and are rich in minerals

103
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.620
in the long term,

104
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.820
nothing is stopping humanity from constructing a zero propellant transport

105
00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:35.300
network for the terrestrial planets centered on the Marsh and moons.

106
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.370
Tethers are a comparatively cheaper and sustainable solution to making space

107
00:06:40.371 --> 00:06:41.450
travel affordable.

108
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.400
And the rest of the solar system accessible for exploitation and exploration.

109
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.730
Considering that we have the technology to build them today,

110
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.880
there's really no good excuse to wait. Any longer.

111
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.770
Parts of the solar system are far away, but they could be very close.

112
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.970
Speaking of stuff, that's hard to reach, but it doesn't have to be knowledge.
