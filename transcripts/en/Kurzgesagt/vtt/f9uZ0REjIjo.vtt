in the last few years,

5
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:15.210
we've looked back at the achievements of our ancestors that paved the way for

6
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:17.850
our modern world. More than 10,000 years ago.

7
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.740
This year we'll turn our gaze to the future of humanity and how we will explore

Mars,

11
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.250

or to distract yourself from the looming void within, you know,

17
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.280
whatever works for you. You can get the calendar together with a dunk, plushy,

18
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.580
a hoodie, or a poster. If you want, we've put together a few deals.
