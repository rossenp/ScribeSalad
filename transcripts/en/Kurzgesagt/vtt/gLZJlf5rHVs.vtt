00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 0>The night sky seems peaceful and orderly, but in reality,</v>

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.540
stars are careening through the galaxy at speeds of hundreds of thousands of

3
00:00:09.541 --> 00:00:12.900
kilometers per hour, not bound by static formations,

4
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.250
but changing neighborhoods constantly. Fortunately, space is big.

5
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.200
And so the stars of the Milky way are very unlikely to hit us. Unfortunately,

6
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.620
they don't have to hit anything to make us have a ready bad time on earth.

7
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.880
And there are already stars starting to get very close.

8
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.033
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

9
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.560
<v 0>To understand how dangerous stars are to us. We need to talk about gravity.</v>

10
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.610
Gravity attracts every piece of master to every other piece of matter.

11
00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:49.490
In the universe, you are attracted by an atom,

12
00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:51.560
a million light years away and vice versa.

13
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.560
Luckily this force gets weaker over distance,

14
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.260
and it also depends on how massive something is.

15
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.380
So things that are close and are very massive,

16
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.430
are more attractive winning the cosmic tug of war this way,

17
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.520
massive things to find how smaller things behave around them.

18
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.130
The sun makes up 99.7, 5% of all the mass and the solar system.

19
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.670
And so it shapes the behavior and orbits of everything else in it.

20
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.610
Billions of years ago, after the son was born,

21
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.220
the soda system was a chaotic and dangerous place.

22
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.310
As the planets were formed through countless little pieces that collided

23
00:01:25.311 --> 00:01:30.020
constantly, but over the eons, a stable balance emerged today.

24
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.860
Most planets and asteroids have settled into safe and predictable August.

25
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.090
We have the inner and outer planets, the asteroid and Kuyper belt.

26
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.520
And at the edge, the Oort cloud,

27
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.330
a giant sphere of comets orbiting slowly in cold storage.

28
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.420
We really don't want this balance to be disturbed.

29
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.870
If another star came too close to us,

30
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.860
it's gravity would put on everything in the soda system, like a spoiled toddler,

31
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.700
messing up the present holder of the planets and asteroids and comets.

32
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.680
This isn't some imaginary danger. Some 70,000 years ago,

33
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.510
a red dwarf Brown dwarf binary system passed through the all cloud and mess

34
00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:13.040
things up. It might even have sent a deadly onslaught of asteroids our way,

35
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.090
but it could take 2 million years until those visitors from the Oort cloud

36
00:02:17.091 --> 00:02:18.650
arrive in the inner solar system.

37
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.390
But there's a much bigger problem on the horizon. Glazer seven 10,

38
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.980
a red Wolf with about half the mass of the sun is currently headed toward the

39
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.290
solar system in about a million years.

40
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.370
It'll pass through the old cloud and become the brightest star in the night sky,

41
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.440
a close fly by like this would unfold over hundreds of thousands of years

42
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.220
disrupting the orbits of millions of objects in the order cloud considerably.

43
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.900
If we're unlucky, it will trigger a new period of planetary bombardment.

44
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.790
Similar to the early solar system.

45
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.410
The night sky could be filled with comments and asteroids raining down on the

46
00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:55.310
inner solar system.

47
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.550
The larger ones could cause dinosaur level mass extinctions and would be bad for

48
00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:03.730
the stock market, but it could get much worse.

49
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.710
The galaxy is an intense place and stars get close to each other regularly.

50
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.660
So it is possible that a star could come much closer and not just pass us,

51
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.390
but fly directly through the inner solar system.

52
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.090
This would be very bad in the extreme,

53
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.640
the chance of another star colliding with a sun is astronomically unlikely,

54
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.560
but that isn't what we're worried about.

55
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.360
If another star were to pass by about as close as the earth is from the sun,

56
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.060
it could easily object the earth from the solar system.

57
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.820
The odds of such an event are estimated to be around one in 100,000 in the next

58
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:43.380
5 billion India is small, but not absurdly.

59
00:03:43.381 --> 00:03:45.990
So as we discussed in another video,

60
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.590
there seemed to be billions of rogue planets doing their own thing and the

61
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.780
galaxy, and this is one way to make them.

62
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.890
So if this were to happen with an average red dwarf, what would happen?

63
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.700
Kicking earth out of the solar system, as the star enters the soda system,

64
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.350
a small orange dot appears in the sky that grows bigger and bigger for months

65
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.510
eventually becoming visible during the day,

66
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.760
it would get bigger and much brighter than the moon too bright to look at

67
00:04:14.761 --> 00:04:18.840
directly. The night sky would be filled with an airy red glow.

68
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.990
After a few months, it would start striking again.

69
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.410
But so would the sun over a few years,

70
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.360
the sun slowly grows smaller in the sky and with it warmth and light start to

71
00:04:30.361 --> 00:04:33.900
dissipate all around the world. As the days turned dark,

72
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.450
the final winter of humanity would begin.

73
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.550
The polar ice caps begin to grow and spread while clouds, shrivel,

74
00:04:41.551 --> 00:04:45.750
and die forests, freeze and animals die in droves.

75
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.660
As the earth passes, the orbit of Mars,

76
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.170
the average surface temperature has plummeted to near minus 50 degrees.

77
00:04:52.171 --> 00:04:56.640
Celsius from space earth begins to look like an icy moon.

78
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.660
The blue green surface becoming the pale gray white of death.

79
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.860
As global infrastructure breaks down, people huddled together,

80
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.290
indoors burning what they can for warmth.

81
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.160
As the temperature continues to drop counting the days until there'll be out of

82
00:05:11.161 --> 00:05:12.870
food, which no longer grows.

83
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.130
Everybody living at the surface is living on borrowed time.

84
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.440
By the time earth reaches,

85
00:05:19.441 --> 00:05:23.970
Jupiter's always surface temperatures sink to minus 150 degrees Celsius

86
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.300
lower than the coldest ever recorded. Temperatures in Antarctica,

87
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.420
needless to say by now,

88
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.980
almost everyone is dead without the energy from sunlight to

89
00:05:34.981 --> 00:05:38.820
evaporate, water clouds, don't form, and the water cycle stops.

90
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.800
The polar ice caps eventually touch to the equator and the oceans become covered

91
00:05:43.801 --> 00:05:48.630
in a thick layer of ice as more and more of its heats leaks out more water

92
00:05:48.631 --> 00:05:50.490
freezes onto the bottom of the ice sheet.

93
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.940
The concentration of salt in the deep ocean grows poisoning.

94
00:05:53.941 --> 00:05:58.370
Most animals that survived here, although hydrothermal vents,

95
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.510
communities of extremophiles that might adapt to even to these circumstances

96
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.760
deep below the surface,

97
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.080
some bacteria would not notice much of any of this as they're still kept warm by

98
00:06:09.081 --> 00:06:11.810
the radioactive decay of elements in the Earth's core.

99
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.800
As the earth reaches the orbit of Pluto and the Kuiper belt,

100
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.320
the sun is still the brightest star in the sky,

101
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.250
but it's one among many with stars now visible during the day,

102
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.560
the temperature is now barely 40 degrees Celsius above absolute zero below the

103
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:29.870
freezing temperature of the gases in the atmosphere.

104
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.800
A weird spectacle enjoyed by no one,

105
00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:38.780
unfortunately unfolds as the atmosphere turns into nitrogen and then oxygen

106
00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:40.760
snow. Over a few years,

107
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.560
it's deposited into an IC 10 meter thick sheet all over the planet surface with

108
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.620
only a thin whisper of gas remaining,

109
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.140
the frozen corpuses of flora and fauna, uh,

110
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.410
buried beneath them as earth leaves the soda system.

111
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.760
It becomes a road Panisse traveling alone through the dark

112
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.740
lifeless and in solitude. But weirdly enough,

113
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:08.930
there is hope humanity would not be surprised by this potential extinction

114
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:12.080
event. We'd notice it thousands of years in advance.

115
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.960
There's not a lot we could do to stop a star,

116
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.770
but we could prepare most of us would perish,

117
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:23.180
but a few million cuts survive in huge artificial complex is powered by

118
00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:26.390
geothermal and nuclear energy, possibly even fusion.

119
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.170
If we can learn to use the ice around us for power here,

120
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.290
humanity might survive for hundreds of thousands of years.

121
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.000
At some point we would become used to our circumstances and new generations

122
00:07:38.001 --> 00:07:42.680
would watch documentaries in disbelief about the time we had our own star and

123
00:07:42.681 --> 00:07:44.150
could walk the surface of earth.

124
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.900
And at some point we might decide to look for another home.

125
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.370
If the earth were lucky enough to pass by another star with a habitable planet,

126
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.370
we could try to make a fresh start. The space flight,

127
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.850
oddly enough would become very easy without the atmosphere in the way.

128
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.860
So it's not unthinkable that the last survivors would leave earth behind and try

129
00:08:03.861 --> 00:08:06.410
again on a new planet around a new star.

130
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.650
Maybe one day thousands of years later,

131
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.970
the descendants of humanity will tell legends about Earth's ancient past

132
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:19.340
stories of our lost home of a mysterious icy planet

133
00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.780
floating alone and empty through the dark of space.

134
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.460
So basically the key to humanity's survival.

135
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.120
<v 2>Letting about what we'll be dealing with. Well,</v>

136
00:08:31.121 --> 00:08:33.820
we'd better get cracking then our friends from brilliant.

137
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.300
<v 0>Oh, the perfect coaches on the way to becoming more science savvy,</v>

138
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.410
brilliant as a problem solving website and app that makes science accessible in

139
00:08:41.411 --> 00:08:44.230
a practical way. While there's 60 interactive courses,

140
00:08:44.231 --> 00:08:46.810
give you the tools to crack problems in maths, logic,

141
00:08:46.811 --> 00:08:50.710
and engineering all by yourself. Instead of a classic lecture format,

142
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.880
brilliant uses storytelling code writing and hands-on problems to keep you

143
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.390
entertained and engaged this way.

144
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:01.290
A small daily challenge can build up to real longterm understanding of science
