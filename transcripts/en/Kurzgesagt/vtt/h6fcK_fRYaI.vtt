00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.860
<v 0>You were on your way home when you died, it was a car accident.</v>

2
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.080
Nothing particularly remarkable, but fatal, nonetheless,

3
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.910
it was a painless death. The medics tried their best to save you,

4
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.170
but to no avail, your body was so utterly shattered.

5
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.150
You were better off. Trust me. And that's when you met me,

6
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.630
what happened? Where am I going? You died?

7
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.980
I said, master of faculty, no point in mincing words,

8
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.390
there was, there was a truck and it was skidding.

9
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.430
Yes, I, I died.

10
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.400
Yes, but don't feel bad about it. Everyone dies.

11
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.240
You looked around, there was nothing.

12
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.980
This just you and me. What is this place?

13
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.690
Is this the afterlife more or less?

14
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.940
Are you God? Yes. I'm God

15
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.910
my kids, my wife. What about them?

16
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.030
Will they be all right? That's what I like to see. And I said,

17
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.930
you just died. And your main concern is for your family.

18
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.150
That's good stuff right there.

19
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.210
You looked at me with fascination to you. I didn't look like God.

20
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.660
I just looked like some man or possibly a woman,

21
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.360
some vague authority figure. Maybe don't worry.

22
00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:46.070
I said, there'll be fine.

23
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.610
Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way.

24
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.300
They didn't have time to grow contemptuous of you.

25
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.330
Your wife will cry on the outside,

26
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.680
but we'll be secretly relieved to be fair.

27
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.880
Your marriage was falling apart. If it's any consolation,

28
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.860
she'll feel very guilty for feeling relieved. Oh,

29
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.680
so what happens now? Do I go to heaven or hell or something?

30
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.550
Neither you'll be reincarnated.

31
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.440
So the Hindus were right. All religions are right in their own way.

32
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.473
Walk with me.

33
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.040
You followed along as we Strode through the void,

34
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.450
where are we going? Nowhere in particular.

35
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.700
It's just nice to walk while we talk. So what's the point.

36
00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:48.560
Then when I get reborn, I'll just be a blank slate, right,

37
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.230
baby. So all my experiences and everything,

38
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.950
everything I did in this life will matter. Not.

39
00:02:57.951 --> 00:03:02.830
So you have within you all the knowledge and experiences

40
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:06.880
of all your past lives. You've just don't remember them right now.

41
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.630
I stopped walking and took you by the shoulders.

42
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.710
Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful,

43
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.410
and gigantic than you can possibly imagine.

44
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.390
A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are.

45
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.520
It's like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it's hot or cold.

46
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.770
You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel. And when you bring it back out,

47
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.890
you've gained all the experiences it had.

48
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.550
You've been in a human for the last 48 years.

49
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.750
So you haven't stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense

50
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:47.200
consciousness. If we hung out here for long enough,

51
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.330
you'd start remembering everything.

52
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.360
But there's no point to doing that between each life.

53
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.510
How many times have I been reincarnated? That well, lots,

54
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.790
lots and lots and lots of different lives. This time around.

55
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.630
You'll be a Chinese peasant girl in five 40, 80.

56
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.000
Wait, was your sending me back in time?

57
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.560
What I guess typically timers, you know,

58
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:22.030
it only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come from,

59
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.330
where, where you come from.

60
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.780
I come from somewhere, somewhere else. And there are others like me.

61
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.630
I know you'll want to know what it's like there,

62
00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:38.770
but honestly you wouldn't understand, Oh,

63
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.520
you sat a little let down. But wait,

64
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.030
if I get reincarnated to other places in time,

65
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.210
I could have interacted with myself. At some point,

66
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.730
Shoal happens all the time. And with both lives,

67
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.840
only aware of their own lifespan. You don't even know it's happening.

68
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.420
So what's the point of it. All. I looked you in the eye,

69
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.640
the meaning of life.

70
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.810
The reason I made this whole universe is for you to mature.

71
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.280
You mean mankind. You want to ask to mature?

72
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.100
No, just you.

73
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.270
I made this whole universe for you with each new life.

74
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.380
You grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect.

75
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.940
Just me. What about everyone else?

76
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.910
There is no one else in this universe. There's just you and me.

77
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.740
You stared blankly at me, but all the people on earth,

78
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.170
all you different incarnations of you. Wait,

79
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.120
I'm everyone.

80
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.760
Now you're guessing I'm every human being who ever lived,

81
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.670
who will ever live. Yes.

82
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.980
I'm Abraham Lincoln and your John Wilkes booth too.

83
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.100
I am a Hitler. You said,

84
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.170
and you're the millions. He killed Jesus.

85
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.820
And you're everyone who followed him. You fell silent.

86
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.890
Every time you victimized someone, you were victimizing yourself.

87
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.450
Every act of kindness you've done. You've done to yourself.

88
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.310
Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human

89
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.610
was or will be experienced by you.

90
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.440
You thought for a long time, why,

91
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.540
why duel this?

92
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.180
Because someday you will become like me because that's what you are.

93
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.200
You'll one of my kind, you'll my child.

94
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.440
Wow. You setting credulous. You mean I'm a God?

95
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.630
No, not yet. You're a fetus. You're still growing.

96
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.590
Once you've lived every human life throughout all time,

97
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.380
you will have grown enough to be born.

98
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.920
So the whole universe, it's just an egg.

99
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.510
I answered now. It's time for you to move on to your next life.

100
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:22.790
And I sent you on your way.
