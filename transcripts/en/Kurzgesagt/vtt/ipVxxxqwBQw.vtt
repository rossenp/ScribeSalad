1
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.430
<v 0>Since the industrial revolution, humans have released over 1.5 trillion,</v>

2
00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:09.450
tons of carbon dioxide or CO2 into the Earth's atmosphere.

3
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.000
In the year 2019,

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.380
we were still pumping out around 37 billion more that's

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.090
50% more than the year,

6
00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:21.930
2000 and almost three times as much as 50 years ago.

7
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.630
And it's not just CO2.

8
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.590
We're also pumping out growing volumes of other greenhouse gases,

9
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.510
such as methane and nitrous oxide combining all of our greenhouse

10
00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:36.240
gases, where a meeting at 51 billion,

11
00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:41.070
tons of carbon dioxide equivalents each year and emissions

12
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.820
keep rising, but they need to get down to zero.

13
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.310
In recent years,

14
00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:52.290
the consequences have become more serious and visible almost every year breaks

15
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.740
some horrible record. We've had more heat waves,

16
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.090
the most classiest melting and the lowest amount of ice ever recorded at the

17
00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:03.120
North pole of the last 22 years,

18
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.460
20 have been the hottest on record.

19
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.860
The only way to limit this rapid climate change is to decrease our collective

20
00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:12.150
emissions quickly.

21
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.110
But although all countries agree on this goal in principle,

22
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.880
they do not agree who is responsible or who should bear the heaviest load.

23
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.140
The developed countries pointed their own efforts to reduce emissions.

24
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.870
And the fact that the large developing countries on the rise,

25
00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:31.590
especially China are currently releasing much more CO2.

26
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.030
On the other hand, developing countries argue that emissions by the West,

27
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.120
our lifestyle emissions, while for developing countries,

28
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.020
they are survival emissions. Others called rich countries,

29
00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:45.960
hypocrites that got rich by polluting without restraint,

30
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.950
and now expect others not to industrialize and stay fall.

31
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.530
So who is responsible for climate change and CO2 emissions.

32
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.990
And regardless of the past,

33
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.890
who leads to do the most today in this video,

34
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.620
we'll talk exclusively about nation States.

35
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.630
We'll look at the fossil fuel industry in another video question,

36
00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:10.590
one of three,

37
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.360
which countries emit the most carbon dioxide today in

38
00:02:15.361 --> 00:02:19.950
2017, humans emitted about 36 billion, tons of CO2,

39
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.770
more than 50% came from Asia,

40
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.570
North America and Europe followed with 18% and 17%

41
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.280
while Africa,

42
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.630
South America and Oceania together only contributed 8%.

43
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.830
China is by far the world's largest emitter with 10 billion,

44
00:02:37.831 --> 00:02:42.150
tons of CO2 every year or 27% of global emissions.

45
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.610
It's followed by the USA with 15% and the European union with around 10%

46
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.040
together. This is more than half of the world's CO2 emissions.

47
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.690
It's clear that without the willingness and action of these three industrial

48
00:02:56.691 --> 00:02:57.350
blocks,

49
00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.570
humanity will not be able to become carbon neutral and prevent severe climate

50
00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:02.404
change.

51
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.570
Next on our list is India at 7% Russia at 5%

52
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.500
Japan at 3% and Iran, Saudi Arabia,

53
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.010
South Korea and Canada, or just short of 2%

54
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.040
together with the first three,

55
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.240
the top 10 are responsible for 75% of global emissions.

56
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.110
But if we only look at the current situation,

57
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.640
we're not getting the full picture question two of three,

58
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.430
which countries have admitted the most in total.

59
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.290
If we look at emissions throughout history, until today,

60
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.970
the outlook changes drastically the us and the EU

61
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.220
both knocked China off the top spot.

62
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.470
The U S is responsible for 25% of the world's historical emissions,

63
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.790
amazing 400 billion tons, mostly in the 20th century.

64
00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.730
And second place is the EU that 22% China comes in

65
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:05.590
third that just under 13% around half of the USA's

66
00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:06.424
contribution,

67
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.560
India's contribution shrinks to 3% along with the whole of Africa and South

68
00:04:11.561 --> 00:04:12.394
America.

69
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.530
The UK is responsible for 1% of annual global emissions,

70
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.420
but takes 5% of the historical response. [inaudible]

71
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.920
Germany producing 2% of emissions per year.

72
00:04:25.921 --> 00:04:30.690
Today has contributed almost 6% as much as the whole of Africa and

73
00:04:30.691 --> 00:04:32.190
South America combined.

74
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.710
So the narrative that rapid climate change is really the responsibility of the

75
00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:41.490
developing world is hard to defend facts matter,

76
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.520
but this is still not the whole story because focusing on countries mixes,

77
00:04:47.521 --> 00:04:51.060
two things, population numbers, and total emissions.

78
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.360
If a country has more people in general,

79
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.560
it's emissions are of course higher things look very different.

80
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.260
If we look at the jewels like you,

81
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.660
dear viewer question three of three countries emit

82
00:05:06.661 --> 00:05:08.880
the most carbon dioxide per person.

83
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.760
The average human is responsible for around five tons of CO2 each year,

84
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.430
but averages can be misleading.

85
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.860
The countries with the largest CO2 emissions per person are some of the world's

86
00:05:22.861 --> 00:05:26.640
major Auden gas producers and 2017.

87
00:05:26.641 --> 00:05:31.410
Qatar had the highest emissions at a hefty 49 tons per person

88
00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.970
followed by Trinidad and Tobago, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates,

89
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.820
Brunei Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia.

90
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.780
But those are outliers Australia. Yeah.

91
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.370
Have one of the highest carbon footprint per person, 17 tons a year.

92
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.140
That's more than triple the global average and slightly more than the average us

93
00:05:52.141 --> 00:05:54.750
American and Canadian at 16 tons.

94
00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.500
The Germans do a little better at close to 10 tons, but this is still twice.

95
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:04.520
The global average China may be the world's largest to matter,

96
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.800
but it's also the world's most populous country with over 1.4 billion people,

97
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.720
18.5% of the world population per person.

98
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.970
It's above average at seven tons.

99
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.690
Historically CO2 emissions have been closely tied to a high standard of living.

100
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.790
Wealth is one of the strongest indicators of our carbon footprint because as we

101
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:32.270
move from Porter rich, we gain access to electricity,

102
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.920
heating air conditioning, lighting, modern cooking, causal planes,

103
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.600
smartphones, computers, and interact with people across the world. Online.

104
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.480
The enormous rise of China's CO2 emissions is coupled with the greatest

105
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:49.340
reduction of poverty in history.

106
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.790
If we order CO2 emissions by income,

107
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.890
we see that the richest half of countries are responsible for 86% of global

108
00:06:57.891 --> 00:07:01.220
emissions and the bottom half for only 14%,

109
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.970
the average German emits more than five times,

110
00:07:04.971 --> 00:07:09.290
as much as the average Indian in just 2.3 days,

111
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:14.120
the average American emits as much as the average Nigerian in a year.

112
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.190
And not only that,

113
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.030
the harsh reality is that it's the countries that contribute least to the

114
00:07:20.031 --> 00:07:23.330
problem that stand to lose the most from rapid climate change,

115
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.980
the developing world will be hit.

116
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.760
The hardest the consequences could be food insecurity,

117
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.500
conflicts over resources,

118
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:37.630
harsher and more frequent natural disasters and large climate refugee movement.

119
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.830
Question four of three.

120
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.530
So who should take responsibility?

121
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.090
Many of today's richest countries are in a convenient position.

122
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.710
They have become rich over centuries of fossil fuel burning and industrial

123
00:07:53.711 --> 00:07:54.544
production.

124
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:59.530
They have a large historical footprint and their wealth means they still are met

125
00:07:59.531 --> 00:08:00.610
a lot per person,

126
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:05.500
but that country's annual emissions are now dwarfed by other countries because

127
00:08:05.501 --> 00:08:10.270
the giant that is China is finally catching up and other giants like India are

128
00:08:10.271 --> 00:08:14.500
on their way. Many Germans. For example, wonder how,

129
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.310
if Germany only accounts for 2% of yearly emissions,

130
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.850
it can have a meaningful impact on reducing emissions.

131
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.860
The answer is simple for one, the richest countries have the resources,

132
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:31.090
highly educated workforces and technology to develop low cost,

133
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.570
low carbon solutions and spread them around the world.

134
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:39.670
If we don't want poorer countries to become as fossil fuel dependent as we are,

135
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.150
we need low carbon technology to be cheap and available.

136
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.160
And we're getting there.

137
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.690
The cost of renewables is falling quickly and the variety of solutions are on

138
00:08:49.691 --> 00:08:51.640
the horizon for many different sectors,

139
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:54.850
but it needs to happen much faster.

140
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:59.490
If the rich countries of the West to scientists seriously tackle rapid climate

141
00:08:59.491 --> 00:09:03.300
change, the rest of the world would follow because it has no choice.

142
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.410
Just like when the European union enforced energy efficiency standards for

143
00:09:07.411 --> 00:09:10.380
technology. The rest of the world adopted them too,

144
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:15.000
because they wanted to be able to continue trading with the blog. Still.

145
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.790
This doesn't absolve others of their responsibility.

146
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.060
China is the largest CO2 emitter today,

147
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:25.560
and it's China's responsibility to grow in a way that will make it possible to

148
00:09:25.561 --> 00:09:28.470
transition to a zero carbon world in time.

149
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:33.900
Others acting irresponsibly yesterday is a horrible excuse for

150
00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:35.790
repeating the same mistakes today.

151
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:40.980
Climate change is a global problem and no country alone can fix it.

152
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:45.300
Working out who's responsible is not as simple as it seems.

153
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.490
And in a way it's a daft question,

154
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:51.750
but one that has played international politics for decades in the end,

155
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.650
it's pretty simple. Everybody needs to do the best they can.

156
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.670
And right now we are all not doing that,

157
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.940
but we can begin today.

158
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.670
This video is part of a series about climate change.

159
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.270
It's supported by a breakthrough energy, a coalition founded by bill Gates.

160
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.990
That's working to expand the clean energy investment and support the innovations

161
00:10:15.991 --> 00:10:18.510
that will lead the world to net zero carbon emissions.

162
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:22.830
Also a special thanks to the team at our world in data for helping us out with

163
00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:23.880
data and research.
