00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.890
<v 0>The sun smooth and round and peaceful,</v>

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.860
except when it's suddenly vomits,

3
00:00:07.861 --> 00:00:10.800
radiation and plasma in random directions.

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.410
These solar flares and carnal message actions or CMS can hit earth

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.360
and have serious consequences for humanity. How exactly do they work?

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.750
How bad could they be? And can we prepare for them?

7
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.963
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

8
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.760
<v 0>While the sun seems pretty solid, it's actually like a very hot ocean.</v>

9
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.780
So hard that it rips atoms into electrons and nuclei,

10
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.090
all flowing around each other in a plasma.

11
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.950
This plasma is pushed around and shaped by the sun's magnetic field,

12
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.240
similar to how the sun's gravitational field reaches out to the planets and

13
00:00:53.241 --> 00:00:57.560
shapes their orbits. But magnetism is very different from gravity.

14
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.500
Magnetism is one part of a dual force.

15
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.300
Electromagnetism electricity creates magnetic fields and

16
00:01:05.301 --> 00:01:08.810
magnetic fields create electricity on the sun.

17
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.400
The plasma made of electrically charged protons and electrons creates a magnetic

18
00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:17.810
field as they move. And this magnetic field then shapes the flow of particles.

19
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.040
They're stuck in a dynamic feedback loop called a dynamo,

20
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.500
which keeps the sun's magnetic field alive.

21
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.260
This magnetic field stores,

22
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.950
enormous amounts of energy and leaks out over the solar system.

23
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.370
It carries with it, a constant trickle of solar plasma,

24
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.540
like a light rain known as the solar wind creating a sort of space weather,

25
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.040
but it isn't always calm and smooth as the sun's plasma,

26
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.570
churns and flows around itself. Its magnetic field gets all Kings and twist it.

27
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.890
This creates magnetic knots that build up enormous amounts of energy.

28
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.420
When the magnetic knots break like a tangle of Springs, exploding outwards,

29
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.560
the sun that can vomit plasma and other awful things into the soda system.

30
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.150
These soda storms come in many times like solar flares,

31
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.400
a tidal wave of high energy radiation.

32
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.490
They race through the soda system at the speed of light,

33
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.680
sweeping up protons in the solar wind,

34
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.400
accelerating them into a high-speed solar proton storm.

35
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.550
Then there are carnal massive junctions,

36
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.780
which rip millions or billions of tons of plasma from the sun's atmosphere,

37
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.340
catapulting it through the solar system at speeds of up to 9 million kilometers

38
00:02:28.341 --> 00:02:31.460
per hour. When these monsters hit us,

39
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.260
nothing happens on earth while even smaller storms can damage satellites

40
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:37.910
affects radio communication.

41
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.390
What will be dangerous to astronauts for people on the surface space?

42
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.920
Weather is harmless Earth's atmosphere protects us from the worst effects of a

43
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.240
soda flare by absorbing the blast of x-rays high up in the atmosphere. Well,

44
00:02:50.241 --> 00:02:51.740
before it reaches the surface,

45
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.080
the electrified plasma from a CME is deflected by the Earth's magnetic field.

46
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.090
Diverting the energy storm to the and South poles were energetic.

47
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:02.770
Particles fall into the atmosphere,

48
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.820
causing the atmosphere to glow and creating beautiful auroras

49
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.200
as with any sort of weather. Most of the time, things are fine.

50
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.110
Sometimes there are hurricanes though,

51
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.450
or in the case of the sun sodas superstorms and we know that they happen

52
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:23.200
once or twice every century. If one were to happen today,

53
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.820
we would first detect a strong.

54
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:29.020
So the flares are sort of flash before the much more dangerous thunder.

55
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.650
The thunder is a CME consisting of billions,

56
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:37.540
of tons of hot magnetic plasma that crosses the 150 million kilometers between

57
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:41.680
the sun and earth in less than a day. When it arrives,

58
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.770
it causes a shockwave that violently compresses,

59
00:03:44.771 --> 00:03:48.610
the Earth's magnetic field and transfers energy into the magnetosphere,

60
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.260
but it can get worse.

61
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.730
If the magnetic field of the CME is aligned to Earth's in just the right way,

62
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.200
the two magnetic fields merge as the magnetic cloud passes over earth,

63
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.020
it stretches the Earth's field into a long tail.

64
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.720
Eventually the energy stored in the tail becomes too much to contain it snaps

65
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.600
and explosively releases its energy towards earth.

66
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.120
A geomagnetic storm has begun a few hundred years ago.

67
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.440
Nobody would have cared.

68
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.820
This storm gushing over the earth is not relevant for machines made out of meat

69
00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:26.740
and bones, but it's very relevant for machines made out of metal and wire.

70
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.260
Remember the dynamo magnetism creates electric currents earth in the

71
00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:35.740
21st century is covered in millions of kilometers of wires,

72
00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:39.940
transporting electricity and a complex grid of machines like transformers that

73
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:41.350
make this transfer possible.

74
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.540
A CMIO energy can induce currents in our power grid that can either completely

75
00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:48.220
shut it down or worse.

76
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.460
Destroy the transformer stations that keep our grid running.

77
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.530
This has happened already like when the Quebec power grid failed after a strong

78
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.920
soda storm in 1989, but in general,

79
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.230
our engineers know how to deal with these storms.

80
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.300
And so we usually don't even notice the last time a solar hurricane washed

81
00:05:07.301 --> 00:05:10.840
over earth was in 1859. The Carrington event,

82
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.530
the largest geomagnetic storms ever observed on earth.

83
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.080
Massive auroras occurred as far South as the Caribbean. In some places,

84
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.560
they were so bright that people got up thinking the sun was rising.

85
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.540
Luckily we only had one sort of modern technology, Telegraph systems.

86
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.970
They failed all over the world,

87
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.960
shopping their operators and chucking out sparks. Today.

88
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.010
We have a tad more technology and our luck may run out soon,

89
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.040
another bad. So the storm is bound to happen.

90
00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:46.510
Eventually a storm as strong as the Carrington event missed earth only by a

91
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:51.400
small margin in 2012 studies projected that it would have inflicted serious

92
00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:56.260
damage to electronic systems globally costing up to $2.6 trillion

93
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.410
to the U S alone.

94
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.480
The time to replace all the damaged systems was estimated at between four and 10

95
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:07.250
years. It's hard to say how bad it could have been experts disagreed.

96
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.720
Some assume there would just be temporary blackouts, but others worried.

97
00:06:10.721 --> 00:06:11.780
It could be much worse.

98
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.680
We won't know for sure until a big solar hurricane hits us.

99
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.540
The probability of such an event is estimated to be 12% per decade.

100
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.950
That's about a 50 50 chance of at least one in the next 50 years.

101
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.010
And there is more unsettling news.

102
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.230
A 2019 paper found that even calm stars like our sun can create

103
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.600
super flares. Every few thousand years,

104
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.070
eruptions orders of magnitude stronger than the strongest storms we have

105
00:06:40.071 --> 00:06:44.180
observed in the solar system. If such a storm hits us unprepared,

106
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.460
the consequences could be catastrophic.

107
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.360
It's hard to overstate how much we depend on electricity.

108
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.310
It's not just the lights at home. It means no computers, no communication,

109
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.510
no navigation,

110
00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.800
a sustained power outage might lead to a breakdown of the supply chain,

111
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.480
water supply systems,

112
00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:06.710
failing and hospital generators running dry supermarkets,

113
00:07:06.711 --> 00:07:09.650
not being refilled while food rots in the fields,

114
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.360
the lack of power might make it extremely hard to reboot our broken power grid,

115
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.590
taking years or decades to restart our starving civilization.

116
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.050
<v 2>Okay. Time to panic.</v>

117
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.490
<v 0>As much as daily newspapers might like for solar storms to send this back to the</v>

118
00:07:25.491 --> 00:07:29.600
stone age, they probably won't. Fortunately, even though solar storms,

119
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:34.010
aren't preventable virtually all of their nasty side effects are the

120
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:38.780
scientists observing the sun have a few hours up to a few days to see a CME

121
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:39.643
coming.

122
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.880
And the engineers working the systems that keep the world running are well aware

123
00:07:43.881 --> 00:07:45.950
of the risks posed by soda storms,

124
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.660
transformers and substations can be taken offline, short,

125
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:54.350
preventative blackouts, or in other words, by unplugging stuff,

126
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:58.910
engineers can open up extra lines to dissipate the extra power and with

127
00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:03.230
investment and upgrades cheap compared to those other natural disasters require

128
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.520
we could protect the world's electric grid against even the nastiest of storms.

129
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:12.020
But we do need to prepare while the risk is manageable.

130
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.610
It is real for one hour. Sunbathes us in warm and pleasant light.

131
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:21.650
One day, it might send a monster our way that we better be ready for

132
