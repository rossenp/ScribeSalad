00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.080
<v 0>Over the last decade, milk has become a bit controversial.</v>

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.510
Some people say it's a necessary and nutritious food vital for healthy bones,

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.060
but others say it can cause cancer and lead to an early death. So who's right.

4
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.673
And why.

5
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.103
<v 1>Anyway.</v>

6
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.030
<v 0>Milk is the basis of every memos diet after birth.</v>

7
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.940
When our digestive systems are immature and small,

8
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.070
basically it's power food to kickstart our bodies and help us grow.

9
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.160
Milk is rich in fat vitamins,

10
00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:45.140
minerals and milk sugar lactose on top of that for a while

11
00:00:45.141 --> 00:00:45.890
after birth,

12
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.240
it also contains antibodies and proteins that protect us from infections and

13
00:00:50.241 --> 00:00:54.560
regulate our immune system. But it's a lot of effort for mothers to produce.

14
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.420
Eventually humans stopped drinking mother's milk and transitioned to the diet of

15
00:00:59.421 --> 00:01:00.254
their parents.

16
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.750
This is how it's been for thousands of years until about 11,000 years

17
00:01:05.751 --> 00:01:09.770
ago. When our ancestors settled down in the first agricultural communities,

18
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.140
soon, they domesticated the first dairy animals, goats, sheep, and cattle.

19
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.300
They found that dairy animals are able to be useless and abundance stuff and

20
00:01:20.301 --> 00:01:22.430
turn it into nutritious and tasty food.

21
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.920
This made a huge difference in terms of survival, especially in hard times.

22
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.590
So groups that had milk available had an evolutionary advantage and through

23
00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:37.910
natural selection, it changed the genes of communities who consumed a lot of it.

24
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.320
This adaptation has to do with a specialized enzyme.

25
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.500
Lactase babies have a lot of it in their system,

26
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.340
so they can break down the milk, sugar, lactose and digest milk easily.

27
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.150
But the older we grow, the fewer lactase enzymes,

28
00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:58.040
our body produces worldwide about 65% of the population do

29
00:01:58.041 --> 00:01:59.840
not have the enzyme after infancy,

30
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.820
which means they are not able to digest more than about 150 minutes is each day.

31
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.040
This lactose intolerance is not spread evenly around the world though,

32
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.250
in some East Asian communities, for example,

33
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.240
it's up to 90% in Northern Europe and North America.

34
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:18.950
The rates are the lowest overall.

35
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.870
There are probably a few reasons for this uneven distribution.

36
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.840
The trade was first introduced by random mutation,

37
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.020
which happened independently of each other in a few populations.

38
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.120
The fact that farming replaced hunting and gathering more and more created

39
00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:36.320
natural selection, pressure,

40
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.300
people who are able to digest lactose had more foods at hand,

41
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.470
which was an advantage, the migration of dairy farmers to the North,

42
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.700
then spread it further,

43
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.150
which probably pushed back populations there that didn't have the trait.

44
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.210
Okay. But if milk has been a valuable part of our diet for thousands of years,

45
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.130
why is it so controversial?

46
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.130
<v 2>There are.</v>

47
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.030
<v 0>Number of claims regarding the negative and positive health effects of milk.</v>

48
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.490
The negative ones cover a wide variety from brittle bones to

49
00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:15.570
cancer and cardiovascular diseases to intolerance and allergies.

50
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.200
<v 2>So how do they hold up? Some.</v>

51
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.180
<v 0>Studies found a connection between milk and a high risk of breast colon and</v>

52
00:03:24.181 --> 00:03:24.660
prostate.

53
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.970
<v 2>Cancer. But.</v>

54
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.740
<v 0>Metro analyses found no impact on your cancer risk on the country.</v>

55
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.150
The calcium in milk might even have a protective effect against colon cancer.

56
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.820
Although this could be calcium in general,

57
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.460
it's not clear milk plays a role in this effect.

58
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.620
Only studies on prostate cancer showed an increased risk for people who consumed

59
00:03:46.621 --> 00:03:49.740
more than one and a quarter liters of milk a day. But again,

60
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.390
the association is inconsistent and other studies don't find any effects.

61
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.800
We discussed these studies in more detail in our sources document.

62
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.080
All in all the research seems to show that if you drink between 100 to 250

63
00:04:04.081 --> 00:04:07.440
milliliters of milk per day, cancer is not a concern.

64
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.163
<v 2>Similarly.</v>

65
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.490
<v 0>Meta analyses could not find any impact from milk or dairy products on your risk</v>

66
00:04:14.491 --> 00:04:17.460
of heart disease stroke, or your total mortality.

67
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.380
Some studies even suggested that high blood pressure might be rarer in people

68
00:04:22.381 --> 00:04:23.430
who eat a lot of dairy.

69
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.880
Although the evidence is not strong enough to claim this with confidence.

70
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.560
The case gets more complicated though. When we look at boats,

71
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.970
a number of studies found neither positive nor negative effects for adults.

72
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.860
What most people worry most about though, are harmful amounts of pesticides,

73
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.030
antibiotics, or hormones. There are hormones in milk,

74
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.140
but only in very low concentrations. For example,

75
00:04:49.141 --> 00:04:51.780
to get the same amount of hormones as from the pill,

76
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.890
you'd need to drink about 5,000 liters of milk. And even if you did,

77
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.820
most hormones would be destroyed by your digestive system before they could

78
00:04:59.821 --> 00:05:00.654
affect you,

79
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.130
which is the reason why so much medication is coated to protect it from our

80
00:05:05.131 --> 00:05:08.760
digestion for pesticides and antibiotics.

81
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.780
There are regulations in most parts of the world that only allow completely

82
00:05:12.781 --> 00:05:17.640
harmless amounts milk that surpasses these thresholds is not allowed to

83
00:05:17.641 --> 00:05:18.474
go on the shelf.

84
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.130
So there's nothing in particular to worry about besides allergies and those

85
00:05:23.131 --> 00:05:27.420
suffering from lactose intolerance is the best known negative effects of milk of

86
00:05:27.421 --> 00:05:31.410
probably acne and general discomfort after drinking milk or eating dairy

87
00:05:31.411 --> 00:05:35.400
products. And here the effects are very real. For example,

88
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.570
skimmed milk has been found to statistically increase the rate of acne by

89
00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:44.220
24% outages against milk products are especially prevalent among children

90
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.510
with one in 18 kids in Germany, suffering from them. In general,

91
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.560
these outages tend to get better or disappear as they grow older, though.

92
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.160
Okay, is milk healthy, then milk? No matter it comes from mothers,

93
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.940
cows, sheep, goats, or camels is a nutrient dense food.

94
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.950
It contains all necessary macro nutrients and many micronutrients,

95
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.940
especially in regions where people struggle to get enough calories,

96
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.840
milk can contribute to a healthy life and lower child mortality.

97
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.910
For those living in the developed world in general, milk is not harmful.

98
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:23.990
If you are not allergic or intolerant to it, especially for children,

99
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.890
it's a good way to get large amounts of calcium and for vegetarians,

100
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.820
it's a good source of vitamin B12 and B vitamins in general.

101
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.870
This does not mean there are not other alternatives with the same effects.

102
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.510
You do not need to drink milk to be healthy.

103
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.220
Milk is also definitely not a substitute for water.

104
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.760
Milk is power food and the additional calories from drinking.

105
00:06:46.761 --> 00:06:49.970
A lot of it on a regular basis can contribute to being overweight,

106
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.190
especially flavored milk or chocolate milk is more comparable to beverages like

107
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.810
lemonade than a healthy snack.

108
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.970
And there's another thing to consider milk production has a significant impact

109
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:03.050
on the global climate.

110
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.670
About 33% of cropland is used to feed grazing animals,

111
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.350
including dairy cattle,

112
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.240
even though the carbon footprint of dairy products has declined since 1990 dairy

113
00:07:14.241 --> 00:07:18.380
production is still responsible for 3% of all greenhouse gas emissions,

114
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:23.560
even more than all aeroplanes combined milk is a huge industry.

115
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:28.030
And most of its production in factory farms causes incredible suffering.

116
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.520
Cows are impregnated over and over separated from their young shortly after

117
00:07:33.521 --> 00:07:37.270
birth and slaughtered. Once they're tortured, bodies are not productive anymore.

118
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.760
We can't ignore that much of the milk.

119
00:07:39.761 --> 00:07:44.230
We consume stems from an industry that is basically torture and contributes to

120
00:07:44.231 --> 00:07:49.150
climate change was about plant based milk in

121
00:07:49.151 --> 00:07:51.670
terms of protein levels and nutritional value.

122
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.280
Only soy milk can compare to cow milk.

123
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.050
The others need to be artificially enriched to reach similar levels of vitamins

124
00:07:59.051 --> 00:08:02.290
and calcium so they can be an alternative to,

125
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.940
and another option might be available. Soon.

126
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:12.040
Several startups have created non-animal milk that is nutritionally identical to

127
00:08:12.041 --> 00:08:16.180
dairy milk. For example, through fermentation by gene modified bacteria area

128
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.340
slapped, grown milk can even be turned into cheese.

129
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:25.570
Something that plant-based alternatives struggle with because they lack casein

130
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.950
and whey protein. The key ingredients that give dairy its taste and structure,

131
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.910
the environmental impacts is a different story though.

132
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:39.820
Many local tentatives use significantly less energy land and less water to

133
00:08:39.821 --> 00:08:43.840
produce. So they have a much lower environmental impact than animal milk.

134
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.710
If you want to have the lowest possible negative impact on the planet,

135
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.130
the best choice is whatever mill called tentative as regional

136
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.490
as with almost any topic. Milk is complicated.

137
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.580
It's not harmful for the majority of the population.

138
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.590
And it's crucial for many people around the world. It's good, nutritious food,

139
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.220
but also harmful to the planet and causes a lot of suffering.

140
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:13.590
We need to decide as a society, how we want to deal with these facts.

141
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:31.790
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>
