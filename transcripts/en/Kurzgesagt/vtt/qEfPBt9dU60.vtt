00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.090
<v 0>What would happen if we were to designate a very,</v>

2
00:00:03.091 --> 00:00:05.550
very powerful nuclear weapon on the moon,

3
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.530
would the explosion knock its orbit towards earth causing tidal waves and

4
00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:13.170
misery, could the moon be destroyed?

5
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.290
Showering the earth in a rain of meteoric death.

6
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:23.563
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

7
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:26.720
<v 0>During the cold war,</v>

8
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.460
the moon was a major target for space exploration and you know, military basis.

9
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.740
So the us air force commissioned a serious study into the effects of a nuclear

10
00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:41.210
designation on the surface of the moon, but just quoting stuff is boring.

11
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.250
So let's conduct a very important scientific experiment with an imaginary 100

12
00:00:46.251 --> 00:00:50.930
megaton thermonuclear warhead about twice as powerful as the most powerful bomb

13
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.823
ever.

14
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.120
Detonators will also place a number of curious astronauts around the moon.

15
00:00:56.121 --> 00:01:00.710
As observers let's push the button and slow down time

16
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.660
for the first few milliseconds, nothing much happens outside our weapon.

17
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.890
Meanwhile,

18
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.540
inside high explosives send a shockwave to a radioactive metal core,

19
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.100
compressing it so much that it reaches criticality and starts a nuclear

20
00:01:16.101 --> 00:01:17.300
efficient chain reaction.

21
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.460
The 100 million degree plasma created in this first stage sets off the second

22
00:01:22.461 --> 00:01:24.230
stage with atomic nuclei,

23
00:01:24.231 --> 00:01:28.220
fusing like they do in the core of a star very briefly,

24
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.970
how weapon contains one of the hottest places in the universe,

25
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.610
and only now barely 10 milliseconds later does the rest of the universe find out

26
00:01:37.611 --> 00:01:41.930
that anything has happened as suddenly the bomb dissolves and the flaming star

27
00:01:41.931 --> 00:01:45.650
of nuclear death is born so far so good,

28
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.790
but everything that happens now is very different from what we're used to on

29
00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:53.300
earth, because of one major difference. There's no atmosphere.

30
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.640
As the fireball shines, it releases a flash of x-rays and thermal photons,

31
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.110
a wave of silent heat,

32
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.060
which rushes outwards in all directions on earth vis heat will char and

33
00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:08.000
burn everything within a 50 kilometer radius, at least,

34
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.780
but on the moon without an atmosphere and oxygen rich air,

35
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.560
there's no burning at all. Also, there are no things to burn.

36
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.900
The crunchy top side of the moon is made from silicate rock and metals chew to

37
00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:25.190
dust by eons of meteorite impacts mixed with tiny traces of water.

38
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.170
When heated by the explosion,

39
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.130
x-rays from the fireball vaporizer thin cloud of rock from the lunar surface

40
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.990
while the unlucky dust that's inside the fireball melt center glass and he

41
00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:40.340
astronauts washing the soap within about 50 kilometers can expect to be fried.

42
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.050
And now we begin to see one of the biggest differences between explosions in

43
00:02:45.051 --> 00:02:47.510
space and on earth on earth.

44
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.210
The atmosphere fights back against the plasma bubble.

45
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.560
Its expansion is violently stomped within moments by the pressure of the

46
00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:58.910
atmosphere, but this is not good news. As the fireball Rams,

47
00:02:58.911 --> 00:02:59.744
the atmosphere,

48
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.370
it produces the most destructive part of a nuclear explosion on earth.

49
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.170
The shockwave compressed air around the explosion rushes out faster than the

50
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:12.400
speed of sound, shattering buildings and roaring so loud. It ruptures organs,

51
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.920
but on the moon, there is no shockwave.

52
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.200
No atmosphere means nothing to impede the expanding explosion in space on

53
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:20.770
the moon.

54
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.330
The fireball just grows in airy silence as there's no atmosphere to stop it or

55
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:29.920
to give to voice. This would be an amazing thing to watch from a safe distance.

56
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.360
Unfortunately,

57
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.140
there's hardly any safe viewing distance for a nuclear explosion on the moon,

58
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.760
without an atmosphere weakening the deadly ionizing radiation that can scramble

59
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:44.320
DNA. Anyone close enough to get a good look will be exposed to fatal amounts of

60
00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:49.060
radiation. But of course that's not all while all of this happens.

61
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.100
The explosion hammers against the moon,

62
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.300
transferring about a 10th of the explosion, energy into seismic waves,

63
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.340
powering and intense moon quake.

64
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.480
The moon is much smaller than the earth and our astronauts will feel an

65
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.190
inescapable, violent shaking,

66
00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:07.510
no matter where they're standing comparable to an earthquake of seven on the

67
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.830
ratio scale, this shaking could seriously damage or even level infrastructure.

68
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:13.660
We might've built anywhere on the moon.

69
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.290
Those who hit on the first side of the moon would have no idea.

70
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:19.990
It was an explosion. The quaking would feel like an asteroid.

71
00:04:19.991 --> 00:04:21.880
The size of the great pyramid had struck,

72
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.500
and it's not over yet where our bomb explodes.

73
00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:28.120
The ground splatters like water.

74
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.620
When a rock strikes upon as the explosion pushes against the surface,

75
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.390
it may excavate as much as a hundred million cubic meters of Dustin rock forming

76
00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:41.530
a crater eight kilometer across while bedrock is pulverized to rubble.

77
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.320
Debris is shot into the sky in every direction. Again, without an atmosphere,

78
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.880
there's no drag to slow any of it down. Much of the debris scattered,

79
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.810
never returns to the moon flying off at faster than escape velocity.

80
00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.640
A flurry of micrometeorites have been cast off to explore the soda system.

81
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.280
Many of which will rain down on the earth though.

82
00:05:03.281 --> 00:05:05.020
Few will be larger than pebbles.

83
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.250
Any satellite astronauts or space station in the way though,

84
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.870
we'll have a really bad time.

85
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.800
Micrometeorites are launched at many speeds and angles,

86
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.440
allowing them to spread all over the surface of the moon,

87
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.670
like bullets they'll punch through our curious astronauts,

88
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.760
no matter where they stand. Finally,

89
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.880
our explosion comes to an end on earth.

90
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.680
The fireball rises like a hot air balloon forming a sort of stalk as it reaches

91
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:36.670
up. Cooler air is drawn in around it, rounding the top into a mushroom clouds,

92
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.080
but on the moon. Well, you know, by now no atmosphere, no mushroom,

93
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.580
the larger the plasma gets the cooler it becomes and the less energy it has to

94
00:05:45.581 --> 00:05:50.050
make interesting or terrifying things happen within seconds of putting the

95
00:05:50.051 --> 00:05:52.900
trigger, the bubble reddens and fades from view,

96
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.010
it would be visible from the earth like a star flickering to life only to fade

97
00:05:58.011 --> 00:06:00.260
out right away, a spark,

98
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.270
and then nothing as the cloud of tiny debris reaches far above the surface of

99
00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:08.270
the moon. It's illuminated by the sun for a few minutes,

100
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.530
giving us an airy beauty for anyone left to observe the spectacle.

101
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.140
What about the moon's orbit?

102
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.550
It's basically unchanged trying to move the moon with a nuke.

103
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.950
It's like trying to move a truck by blowing on it.

104
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.450
Nuclear explosions may be big, but space is bigger.

105
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.610
Our mighty explosion just leaves another traitor. One among millions,

106
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.050
still anyone on the moon will continue to not enjoy themselves.

107
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.370
The material that ends up writing back to the moon is radioactive and without

108
00:06:40.371 --> 00:06:43.010
any natural processes to wash it away or barriers,

109
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.360
the surface of the moon will remain contaminated. Although fortunately,

110
00:06:47.361 --> 00:06:51.080
the worst of the radiation will have decayed to a level comparable to natural

111
00:06:51.081 --> 00:06:55.250
levels from cosmic rays in about a year in conclusion,

112
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.210
we can say with confidence that while the moon itself does not care about being

113
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:04.190
mute and we'll barely notice using the moon as a nuclear test ground kind

114
00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:08.000
of ruins it for everyone trying to spend some time there or to build something

115
00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:11.870
useful. So maybe we should just not do that.

116
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.900
This was our last video of the year, 12,020, and, uh, ODL.

117
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.050
Wasn't interesting in where Jared's been in all the worst ways,

118
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.530
but it's finally over. We want to end it by saying thank you.

119
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.300
We get to do this channel and work on many exciting things because of you burbs

120
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.630
this year, our German channel reached a million subscribers.

121
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.260
We launched our Spanish one and released our first app.

122
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:37.910
If everything goes well,

123
00:07:37.911 --> 00:07:41.210
we can finally start our largest new project to date next year,

124
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.340
but we know better than to promise too much.

125
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:47.660
All of this works because you support us directly. Thank you so much.

126
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.700
We genuinely appreciate it.

127
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.840
If you want to help us out too and get something cool in return to the tune of

128
00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:54.674
nuking, the moon,

129
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:58.760
we've made a new minimalistic infographic poster about the moon and how

130
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:03.560
incredibly far away it is also. There's a baby duck, our cutest plushy.

131
00:08:03.561 --> 00:08:08.390
Yes, a new duck and friends, enamel mug, our new ocean Explorer notebook,

132
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.420
and so much more all made with love and care.

133
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.990
Let us know what you like and we'll make more of it. Okay.

134
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.600
Let's wrap up this video and this year,

135
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:21.170
thank you again for watching and caring and sharing.

136
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:25.430
We hope that you slide peacefully into the year 12,021.

137
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.560
Let's all hope. It will be a really.

138
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:28.660
<v 1>Yeah.</v>
