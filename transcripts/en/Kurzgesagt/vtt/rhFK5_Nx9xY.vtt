00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.100
<v 0>The observable universe is a big place that's been around for more than</v>

2
00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:06.720
13 billion years.

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.030
Up to 2 trillion galaxies made up of something like 20,000 billion

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.560
billion stars surround our home galaxy in the Milky way.

5
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:21.300
Alone scientists assume there are some 40 billion Earth-like planets

6
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.890
in the habitable zone of their stars. When we look at these numbers,

7
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.280
it's hard to imagine that there is nobody else out there.

8
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.710
It would change our perception of ourselves forever. If we found others,

9
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.160
just knowing that this vast place is not dead,

10
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.990
would shift our perspective outwards and could help us get over our irrelevant

11
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.940
quarrels. But before looking for our new best friends or worst enemies,

12
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.360
we have a problem to solve. What are we actually looking for?

13
00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.693
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

14
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.270
<v 0>In a universe that big and old,</v>

15
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.440
we have to assume that civilizations start millions of years apart from each

16
00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:09.260
other and develop in different directions and speeds.

17
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.570
So not only are we looking over distances of dozens to hundreds of thousands of

18
00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:15.404
light years,

19
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.820
we're looking for a civilization ranging from cavemen to super advanced.

20
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.980
So we need a conceptual framework to enable us to think better thoughts that

21
00:01:24.981 --> 00:01:26.480
make us able to search better.

22
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.380
Are there universal rules that intelligent species follow?

23
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.850
Currently our civilization sample size is only one.

24
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.140
So we may make incorrect assumptions based solely on ourselves.

25
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.120
It's still better than nothing.

26
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.770
We know that humans started out with nothing but binds and hands that could

27
00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:49.790
build tools. We know that humans are curious, competitive,

28
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.650
greedy for resources and expansionist. The more of these qualities,

29
00:01:54.651 --> 00:01:55.760
our ancestors had,

30
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.970
the more successful they were in the civilization building game.

31
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.490
Being one with nature is nice,

32
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.020
but it's not the path to irrigation systems or gunpowder or cities.

33
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.030
So it's a reasonable to assume that aliens able to take over their home plan is

34
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.740
also have these qualities.

35
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.550
And if aliens have to follow the same laws of physics,

36
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.490
then there is a measurable metric for progress.

37
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.740
Energy use is human progress can be measured very precisely by how much

38
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.090
energy we extracted from our environment and how we made it usable to do things.

39
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.990
We started with muscles until we learned to control fire.

40
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.250
Then we made machines that used kinetic energy from water and wind.

41
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.600
As our machines got better and down knowledge of materials expanded.

42
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.810
We began to harness the concentrated energy from dead plants.

43
00:02:44.811 --> 00:02:49.340
We dug up from the ground as our energy consumption grew exponentially.

44
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.900
So did the abilities of our civilization between 1,820

45
00:02:53.901 --> 00:02:58.400
15 population size had increased seven fold while humanity was

46
00:02:58.401 --> 00:03:00.970
consuming five times more energy.

47
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.440
It's likely that this process will continue into the far future.

48
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.040
Based on these facts, scientists, Nikolai Carter,

49
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.600
chef developed a method of categorizing civilizations from cave dwellers to

50
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:16.780
God's ruling over galaxies. The Cotter chef scale,

51
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.380
a method of ranking civilizations by their energy use.

52
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.540
The scale has been refined and expanded on over the decades, but in general,

53
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:28.630
it puts civilizations into four different categories.

54
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.520
A type one civilization is able to use the available energy of their home

55
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:34.354
planet.

56
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.610
A type two civilization is able to use the available energy of vest star and

57
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.863
penetrate a system.

58
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.060
A type three civilization is able to use the available energy of their galaxy.

59
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.250
A type four civilization is able to use the available energy of multiple

60
00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:52.084
galaxies.

61
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.810
These levels differ by orders of magnitude and it's linked pairing an ant

62
00:03:57.811 --> 00:04:02.760
colony to a human metropolitan area to ans we are so complex and

63
00:04:02.761 --> 00:04:07.200
powerful. We might as well be gods. So to make the scale more useful,

64
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.980
we need subcategories on the lower end. The spectrum.

65
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.710
There are times zero to type one civilizations,

66
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.880
anything from Hunter gatherers to something we could achieve in the next few

67
00:04:17.881 --> 00:04:22.410
hundred years. These mice actually be abundant in the Milky way,

68
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.480
but a civilization that is not actively transmitting radio signals into space

69
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.830
might be as close as our nearest Stella neighbor, the alpha centaury system.

70
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.620
And we would have no way of realizing they exist,

71
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.980
but even if they transmitted radio signals,

72
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.540
can we do it might not be very helpful on an interstellar scale.

73
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.970
Humanity is practically invisible,

74
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.950
our signals mixed and over an impressive 200 light years,

75
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.010
but this is only a tiny fraction of the Milky way.

76
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.300
And even if someone were listening after a few light years,

77
00:04:57.301 --> 00:04:59.400
our signals decay into noise,

78
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.990
impossible to identify as the source of an intelligent species today.

79
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.380
Humanity ranks at about level 0.75.

80
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.250
We have altered our planet. We've created huge structures,

81
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.360
mind and stripped mountains, removed rainforests and drain swamps.

82
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.830
We've created rivers and lakes and change the composition and temperature of the

83
00:05:19.831 --> 00:05:20.664
atmosphere.

84
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.840
If progress continues and we don't make earth uninhabitable,

85
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.490
we will become a full type one civilization in the next few hundred years.

86
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.340
Any civilization that becomes a time,

87
00:05:32.341 --> 00:05:36.150
one is bound to look outside because it's likely that it's still curious,

88
00:05:36.151 --> 00:05:38.340
competitive, greedy and expansionist.

89
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.500
The next reasonable step towards transitioning to type two is trying to alter

90
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.570
and mine. Other planets and bodies.

91
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.560
This might start with outpost in space,

92
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.980
transition to infrastructure and industries near the home is move on to colonies

93
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.430
and end with terraforming other planets by changing their atmosphere,

94
00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.400
their or position as a civilization expands and uses more and more

95
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.550
staff and space it's energy consumption scales with them.

96
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.960
So at some point they may embark on the largest project to lower type two

97
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:13.610
civilization can take on harnessing the energy of their star by building a

98
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:17.300
Dyson swarm. Once this mega structure is finished,

99
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.170
energy has become practically unlimited for molding the home system.

100
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.400
However they see fit. If they are still curious, competitive,

101
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:29.900
greedy and expansionist, and now have complete control over that home system,

102
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.440
the stellar infrastructure in place and the energy output of a star,

103
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.990
the next frontier moves to other stars,

104
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.440
light years away for a time to civilization.

105
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.310
The distance to other stars might feel like the distance between earth and Pluto

106
00:06:43.311 --> 00:06:46.160
does to us today, technically within reach,

107
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.660
but only with immense investments in terms of time, ingenuity and resources.

108
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.260
This begins their transition towards type three.

109
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.600
This step is so far beyond us,

110
00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.740
that it becomes hard to imagine what exactly these challenges will look like and

111
00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:01.790
how there'll be solved.

112
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.440
Will they be able to find a solution to the vast distances and travel times of

113
00:07:06.441 --> 00:07:08.030
hundreds or thousands of years,

114
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.830
will they be able to communicate and keep a shared culture and biology between

115
00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:15.770
colonies light years apart all?

116
00:07:15.771 --> 00:07:18.650
Will they split into separate type two civilizations,

117
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.930
maybe even different species?

118
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.410
Are there deadly challenges between the stars?

119
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.710
So the closer a species gets to type three,

120
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.920
the harder it becomes to fathom what it might actually look like.

121
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.080
They might discover new physics may understand and control dark matter and

122
00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:38.780
energy, or be able to travel faster than light.

123
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.640
We might be unable to grasp that motives technology and actions

124
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.220
Schumanns are the ants trying to understand the galactic metropolitan area,

125
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:54.890
a high type two civilization might already consider humanity too primitive to

126
00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:59.390
even talk to a type three civilization might feel about as light.

127
00:07:59.391 --> 00:08:01.820
We feel about the bacteria living on the anthill.

128
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.440
Maybe they wouldn't even consider as conscious or our survival relevant.

129
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.950
We could only pray that they're nice gods,

130
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.400
but the scale doesn't necessarily. And here,

131
00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:18.200
some scientists suggest there might be type four and type five civilizations

132
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:22.670
whose influence stretches of a galaxy clusters or superclusters structures,

133
00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:27.590
comprising thousands of galaxies and trillions of stars. Ultimately,

134
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:32.300
there might be a type of Omega civilization able to manipulate the entire

135
00:08:32.301 --> 00:08:37.220
universe and possibly others type Omega civilizations might be

136
00:08:37.221 --> 00:08:41.780
the actual creators of our universe. For reasons beyond our comprehension.

137
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:46.930
Maybe they were just bored. As flawed as this classification may be.

138
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.440
This thought experiment is already telling us interesting things.

139
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:56.070
If our idea it is about the nature of species that form interstellar is sort

140
00:08:56.071 --> 00:08:56.820
of correct,

141
00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.110
then we can be pretty sure that there are no civilizations of type three and

142
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:02.580
beyond near the Milky way,

143
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:07.680
their influence with an unlikely hood be so all encompassing in that technology

144
00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:10.170
so far above our own that we couldn't miss them.

145
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.240
The galaxy should flash with our activity in thousands of star systems,

146
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:19.980
we should be able to see or detect that artifacts or movements between different

147
00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:21.150
parts of our empire.

148
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:26.750
Even if a type three civilization did exist in the past and died a mysterious

149
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.840
death, we should be able to detect some of the remnants of our empire,

150
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.790
but when scientists logs, they didn't find remnants of harvested stars,

151
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.620
decaying, mega structures, or scars of great interstellar Wars.

152
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:45.270
So they're very likely not out there and never were in a sense.

153
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.210
This is very sad, but also very reassuring.

154
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.440
It leaves the galaxy to us and others similar to us.

155
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.250
So the most promising civilizations to look for,

156
00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:00.660
maybe somewhere in the spectrum from type 1.5 to type 2.5,

157
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.620
they wouldn't be too advanced to understand them and their motives.

158
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.730
They may have finished their first mega structures and they might be in the

159
00:10:08.731 --> 00:10:12.660
process of moving stuff between stars and transmitting enormous amounts of

160
00:10:12.661 --> 00:10:16.050
information into space by an accident or on purpose.

161
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:21.480
They would probably also look to the stars and look for others. Then again,

162
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.860
maybe we've got it all wrong.

163
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.990
Maybe progress to type two does not mean expanding outwards and

164
00:10:27.991 --> 00:10:31.080
humanity is still too immature to imagine.

165
00:10:31.081 --> 00:10:36.060
Otherwise for now, all we ready know is that we haven't seen anybody.

166
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.390
Yes, but we've only just started looking

167
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.620
until we finally find friendly,

168
00:10:43.621 --> 00:10:47.310
super aliens and can ask them to explain the rules of the universe to us.

169
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.220
Most of us have to make do with learning stuff ourselves,

170
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.340
