00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.610
<v 0>For years, people have asked how we make our videos.</v>

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.170
So let's finally talk about it, how to make a coats.

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.270
Cause aren't a video in 1200 hours.

4
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.573
<v 1>Well,</v>

5
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.380
first things first.

6
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.090
<v 0>We need a topic. Our potential topic list is already endless.</v>

7
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.150
And every time we research something, it grows longer.

8
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.690
So we just work on whatever we find exciting at the time.

9
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.880
This could be something serious, fascinating, personal, or just really stupid.

10
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.250
The variety is half the fun.

11
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.470
We want to explain complicated things in an easily graspable way and make

12
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.840
sciency topics fascinating and beautiful.

13
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.390
But we also want to tell stories and express how we feel about the universe from

14
00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:58.040
time to time laying the foundation script.

15
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.480
Our search begins by reading books, all scientific papers,

16
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.840
and by talking to different experts who point us in the right direction,

17
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.100
we want to have a fact-based worldview and our videos are trying to reflect

18
00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:14.720
that. So we often have to change our view on an issue while working on it.

19
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.030
Usually after a few weeks of researching, we start writing a script,

20
00:01:20.031 --> 00:01:24.350
begins with a rough first draft that then we resonant and edited over and over

21
00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:27.770
again, to make sure we don't misrepresent something.

22
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.510
We ask experts to fact check and correct us writing is the

23
00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:35.420
bottleneck for our videos and very hard to speed up.

24
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.670
Usually finishing a script takes between a few weeks and literally years to

25
00:01:40.671 --> 00:01:44.510
complete. Let's visualize illustration.

26
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.680
When the script is ready, we begin sketching out the video.

27
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.480
We try to think of visual metaphors transitions between ideas and decide which

28
00:01:53.481 --> 00:01:56.000
scenes need the most attention on average,

29
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.120
200 panels need to be illustrated in Adobe illustrator.

30
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.900
Although we have built up an illustration library,

31
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.040
we still do most illustrations from scratch to give our videos a more unique

32
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:07.874
look.

33
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.710
The general idea is to find the right images to the words in the script to

34
00:02:12.711 --> 00:02:16.940
explain as clearly as possible while also having interesting things to look at

35
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.893
them.

36
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.760
Also here we include all the visual Easter eggs in total

37
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.660
two to three illustrators spend eight to 12 weeks illustrating the video.

38
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.530
Now it's my turn and duration.

39
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.740
When the whole video is illustrated,

40
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.790
the duration is recorded in a small recording studio on a noisy man TLM one Oh

41
00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:41.750
three microphone and pro tools. It's important to keep the flow.

42
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.190
So I try to get one version done and then go back through retaking paragraphs

43
00:02:46.191 --> 00:02:49.760
and sentences until they feel right. And a full version is ready.

44
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.880
It's alive animation.

45
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.710
Now the scenes and audio need to be animated.

46
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.500
We make things in Adobe after effects and recently we've begun experimenting

47
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:03.520
with cinema 4d.

48
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.230
The first thing to do is take the illustrated scenes apart and organize them.

49
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.460
The hundreds of thousands of parts are then imported into after effects.

50
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.290
Each character is rakes so we can move them more naturally

51
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.880
aside from a few plugins that help us save time.

52
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.870
Every single thing that's moving on screen has been moved manually.

53
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.090
So two to three animators animate scene after scene for about eight to 10 weeks

54
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:31.924
in total,

55
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.450
ending on a high note music and sound design.

56
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.630
The funnel step is the music.

57
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.970
Every song is original music composed to the finished video to create a unique

58
00:03:44.971 --> 00:03:47.430
atmosphere and to highlight the important parts.

59
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.990
You can listen to all of the songs on SoundCloud and Spotify,

60
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.230
the icing on the cake, other sound effects.

61
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.500
Many of you might not even really notice them,

62
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.890
which is a shame because they really add an additional layer.

63
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.890
So try watching a video with headphones,

64
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.600
if you want to get the full depth of it, all of these steps happen in parallel.

65
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.980
Since we usually work on two to four videos at the same time in various stages,

66
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.470
what we haven't mentioned are the countless revisions and edits. Every few days,

67
00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:23.670
we sit together and review our work and tweak it until it feels just right.

68
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.550
And that's it at least 1200 hours for a single codes. Cause art video,

69
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.080
as you can imagine, making videos for thousands of hours is a big team.

70
00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:37.410
And then putting them on the internet for free is a weird business model.

71
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.640
Over the years, we've relied on a number of different things to stay afloat,

72
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.770
commercial work for NGOs, startups, all corporations, sponsorships,

73
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.110
and grants by companies or organizations.

74
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.790
We struck a deal with folk from German public broadcasting to revive the German

75
00:04:53.791 --> 00:04:56.400
channel and with Wix to start a Spanish channel.

76
00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.540
But the reality is we can only do what we do because of you.

77
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.760
Our two most important sources of income by far come from your direct

78
00:05:05.761 --> 00:05:08.670
support merchandise and Patriot.

79
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.930
So if you want to help us stay afloat and keep making more videos,

80
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.880
you can directly support coats cause art,

81
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.290
by getting something beautiful from our store all by becoming a Patrion and

82
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.680
joining the bird army, don't feel obligated though,

83
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.330
watching engaging or sharing our videos is already helping us a lot.

84
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.230
But if you want to support us directly, thank you so much.

85
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.630
You're making our videos free for everyone.

86
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.990
You are enabling us to practice and improve,

87
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.170
to stay independent and to work on ambitious projects.

88
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.240
That would be too scary or too big.

89
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.470
Otherwise coats croissants did not start with an end golden mind.

90
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.730
It began as a personal project because it felt good to make something with time

91
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.400
and love. And this is still true today.

92
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.940
Making these videos is our goal doing work every day and getting better

93
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.630
to make science. Beautiful and interesting.

94
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.900
Thank you so much for sticking with us for seven years.

95
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.990
And from our first subscriber to the 10000000th,

96
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.620
this journey has been so wild and so much fun,

97
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.750
and we can't wait to share the stuff we're working on right now with you in a

98
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:19.340
year or maybe two.

99
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.440
We want to make massive videos like this from time to time. Now,

100
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.470
if you want to ask us questions that you want us to answer,

101
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.780
you can do so on Reddit link.
