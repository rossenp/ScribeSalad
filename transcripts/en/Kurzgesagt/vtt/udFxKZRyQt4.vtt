00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.430
<v 0>Neutron stars are one of the most extreme and violent things in the</v>

2
00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:08.790
universe. Giant atomic nuclei,

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.160
only a few kilometers in diameter,

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.320
but as massive as stars and they owe their existence to the death

5
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.790
of something majestic

6
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.030
Stars exist because of a fragile balance.

7
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.580
The massive millions of billions of trillions of tons of hot plasma

8
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.110
are being pulled in woods by gravity and squeeze material together with so much

9
00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:46.760
force that nuclei fuse hydrogen fuses into helium.

10
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.800
This releases energy, which pushes against gravity and tries to escape.

11
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.700
As long as this balance exists, stars are pretty stable.

12
00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.570
Eventually the hydrogen will be exhausted.

13
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.000
Medium stars like our sun go through a giant phase where they burn helium into

14
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:08.870
carbon and oxygen before they eventually turn into white dwarfs.

15
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.491
But in stars,

16
00:01:10.491 --> 00:01:14.540
many times the mass of our sun things get interesting when the helium is

17
00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:16.370
exhausted for a moment,

18
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.590
the balance of pressure and radiation tips and gravity wins squeezing the star

19
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.080
tighter than before the core burns,

20
00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:28.370
hotter and faster while the outer layers of the star swell by hundreds of times,

21
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.350
fusing heavier and heavier animates. Carbon burns to neon and centuries,

22
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.540
neon to oxygen in a year,

23
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.070
oxygen to Silicon and months and Silicon to iron in a day.

24
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.260
And then death. Iron is nuclear Ash.

25
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.380
It has no energy to give and cannot be fused.

26
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.780
The fusion suddenly stops and the balance ends without the outward pressure from

27
00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:57.530
fusion. The core is crushed by the enormous weight of the star above it.

28
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.230
What happens now is awesome and scary particles like

29
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.080
electrons and protons really don't want to be near each other.

30
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.880
But the pressure of the collapsing staff is so great that electrons and protons

31
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.690
fuse into neutrons, which then gets squeezed together as tightly,

32
00:02:14.691 --> 00:02:18.080
as in atomic nuclei, an iron ball,

33
00:02:18.081 --> 00:02:21.770
the size of the earth is squeezed into a ball of pure nuclear matter,

34
00:02:21.771 --> 00:02:24.830
the size of a city, but not just the core.

35
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.000
The whole star implodes gravity pulling the outer layers in at

36
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:30.920
25%, the speed of light.

37
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.280
This implosion bounces off the iron core,

38
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.990
producing a shockwave that explodes outwards and catapults the rest of the star

39
00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:39.824
into space.

40
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.440
This is what we call a supernova explosion and it will out shine entire

41
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.390
Ganek says what remains of the star is now a neutron star.

42
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.660
Its mass is around a million times, the mass of the earth,

43
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.140
but compressed to an object about 25 kilometers wide.

44
00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.000
It's so dense.

45
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.490
The massive all living humans would fit into one cubic centimeter of neutron

46
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:07.540
star matter. That's roughly a billion tons in a space.

47
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:10.750
The size of a sugar cube put another way.

48
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.430
That's Mount Everest in a cup of coffee from the outside.

49
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:17.950
A neutron star is unbelievably extreme.

50
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.200
It's gravity is the strongest outside black holes. And if it were any denser,

51
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.590
it will become one light is bent around it.

52
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.620
Meaning you can see the front end parts of the back.

53
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.900
Their surfaces reach a million degrees Celsius compared to a measly 6,000

54
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:39.310
degrees for our son. Okay. Let's look inside a neutron star.

55
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.810
Although these giant atomic nuclei are stars in many ways.

56
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.650
They're also like planets with solid crusts over a liquid core.

57
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.350
The crust is extremely hard.

58
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.850
The outermost layers are made of iron leftover from the supernova squeeze

59
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:58.570
together in a crystal lattice with a sea of electrons, flowing through them,

60
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.040
going deeper gravity, squeezes nuclei, closer together.

61
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.560
We find fewer and fewer protons as most merged to neutrons until

62
00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:10.960
we reach the base of the crust here,

63
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.910
nuclei are squeezed together so hard that they start to touch protons and

64
00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:19.120
neutrons rearrange making long cylinders or sheets,

65
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.740
enormous nuclei with millions of protons and neutrons shaped like spaghetti and

66
00:04:23.741 --> 00:04:24.490
the Sanya,

67
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.170
which physicists call nuclear pastor nuclear pastor is so

68
00:04:29.171 --> 00:04:32.200
dense that it may be the strongest material in the universe.

69
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.240
Basically unbreakable lumps of pasta inside a neutron star can

70
00:04:37.241 --> 00:04:40.330
even make mountains at most, a few centimeters high,

71
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.310
but many times as massive as the Himalayas eventually beneath the

72
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:46.840
pastor, we reached the core.

73
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.860
We're not really sure what the properties of matter are when they're squeezed

74
00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:54.760
this heart protons and neutrons might dissolve into an ocean of quarks.

75
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.920
The so-called Clark gluon plasma.

76
00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.700
Some of those quarks might turn into strange quarks,

77
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.550
making a sort of strange matter with properties.

78
00:05:03.551 --> 00:05:06.040
So extreme that we made a whole video about it,

79
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.990
or maybe they just stay protons and neutrons. No one knows for sure.

80
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.790
And that's why we do signs. That's all pretty heavy stuff, literally.

81
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.680
So let's go back out into space. When neutron stars first collapsed,

82
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.950
they began to spin very, very fast, like a battery,

83
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.930
no pulling her arms in neutron stars are celestial batteries spinning

84
00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:30.190
many times per second.

85
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.590
This creates pulses because their magnetic field creates a beam of radio waves,

86
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.600
which passes every time they spend these radio pulsars are the best

87
00:05:40.601 --> 00:05:44.710
known type of neutron star, about $2,000 loan off in the Milky way.

88
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.290
These magnetic fields are the strongest in the universe. A quadrillion times,

89
00:05:50.291 --> 00:05:52.150
stronger than earth after they're born,

90
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.080
they're called magnetism until they come down a little,

91
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.310
but the absolute best kind of neutron stars are friends with other neutron stars

92
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.320
by radiating away energy as gravitational waves ripples in space time,

93
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.820
their orbits can decay and they can crash into and hit each other in a killing

94
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:15.620
over explosion that spews out a lot of their guards when they do the

95
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:19.940
conditions become so extreme. That for a moment, heavy nuclei are made. Again,

96
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.650
it's not fusion putting nuclei together this time, but heavy neutron,

97
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:29.450
rich matter, falling apart and reassembling only very recently,

98
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.380
we've learned that this is probably the origin of most of the heavy elements in

99
00:06:33.381 --> 00:06:38.000
the universe like gold uranium and platinum and dozens more.

100
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.730
So then out two neutron stars collapse and become a black hole dying yet. Again,

101
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.630
not only to stars have to die to create elements.

102
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.280
They have to die twice over millions of years.

103
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.870
These atoms will mix back into the galaxy, but some of them end up in a cloud,

104
00:06:56.871 --> 00:07:01.070
which gravity pulls together to form stars and planets repeating the cycle.

105
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.380
Our solar system is one example and the remains of those neutron stars that came

106
00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:08.030
before us are all around us.

107
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.400
Our entire technological modern world was built out of the elements neutron

108
00:07:13.401 --> 00:07:18.230
stars made in Ian's past sending these atoms on a 13 billion year

109
00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:21.770
journey to come together and make us and our world.

110
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.200
And that's pretty cool

111
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.550
until then we can look at them on paper.

112
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.900
The 12,020 human space era calendar has arrived.

113
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:37.010
You can order it now until we sell out and then never again,

114
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.980
visit the cloudy cities of Venus Dyson swarm assembly on mercury

115
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.560
and cross the borders of our solar system,

116
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.970
shipping from the U S and from Europe for the first time.

117
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.150
But we deliver to every country all over the world.

118
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.480
You could also get a plushy or hoodie or poster.

119
00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:01.610
We have some sweet deals for you. Get it for Christmas, for your friends,

120
00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:02.570
families, and kids,

121
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:07.790
or to distract yourself from the fact that there are 100 billion billion

122
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.630
Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of sun-like stars in the observable

123
00:08:11.631 --> 00:08:14.840
universe. And you will never visit any of them.

124
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.920
The last few years we've sold them all. So no rush, but the clock is ticking.

125
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:24.470
Getting stuff from our shop is one of the best ways to support coats because out

126
00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.001
because of you,

127
00:08:26.001 --> 00:08:30.110
we can keep this channel free for everyone and make more beautiful things.

128
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:33.570
A happy InterStudy year, 12,020.
