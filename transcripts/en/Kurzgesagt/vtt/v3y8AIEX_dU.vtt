00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.860
<v 0>Nothing in the universe is static in the Milky way.</v>

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.680
Billions of stars orbit the galactic center.

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.930
Some like our sun are pretty consistent keeping a distance of around 30,000

4
00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:14.640
light years from the galactic center,

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.450
completing an orbit every 230 million years.

6
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.600
This dance is not an orderly ballet.

7
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.360
More like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers.

8
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.960
This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous.

9
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.830
Our solar neighborhood is constantly changing with stars,

10
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:34.200
moving hundreds of kilometers. Every second,

11
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.600
only the vast distances between objects protect us from the dangers out

12
00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:43.290
there, but we might get unlucky in the future.

13
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.843
At some point,

14
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.830
we could encounter a star going supernova or a massive object passing by

15
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.360
and showering earth with asteroids. If something like this were to happen,

16
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.710
we would likely know thousands if not millions of years in advance,

17
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.320
but we still couldn't do much about it.

18
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.600
Unless we move our whole soda system out of the way

19
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.970
To move the solar system. We need a Stella engine,

20
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.020
a mega structure used to stare at a star through the galaxy.

21
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.100
It's the kind of thing that might be built by an advanced civilization with

22
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.780
Dyson's fair level technology.

23
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.260
That's thinking about their future billions of years ahead of time,

24
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.390
but how do we possibly move the hundreds of thousands of objects in the solar

25
00:01:38.391 --> 00:01:42.230
system? The good news is we can ignore all of that.

26
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.570
We only need to move the sun.

27
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.100
All the other stuff is glued to it by gravity and we'll follow it wherever it

28
00:01:49.101 --> 00:01:49.970
decides to go.

29
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.890
There are lots of ideas about what a static engine might look like and how it

30
00:01:54.891 --> 00:01:55.724
would work.

31
00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.020
We've picked two grounded in our current understanding of physics that could be

32
00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:00.980
built. In theory,

33
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.470
the simplest kind of stellar engine is the Scutter thruster, a giant mirror.

34
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.540
It works on the same principle as a rocket like rocket fuel.

35
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.280
The photons released us solar radiation carry momentum, not a lot,

36
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.200
but a bit. For example, if an astronauts turned on a flashlight in space,

37
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.200
it would push them backwards. Very, very slowly.

38
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.850
A stellar engine will work a little better than a flashlight because the sun

39
00:02:28.851 --> 00:02:30.710
produces a lot of photons.

40
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.080
The basic idea of the shuttle thruster is to reflect up to half of the solar

41
00:02:36.081 --> 00:02:40.430
radiation to create thrust and slowly push the sun where we wanted to go.

42
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.770
In order for the scuttle thruster to work, it must be kept in the same place,

43
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.630
not orbiting the sun. Although the sun's gravity will try to put it in.

44
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.410
It will be supported by radiation pressure, which props the mirror up.

45
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.740
This means the mirror would have to be very light made of micron thin reflecting

46
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:02.440
foil from materials like Anna minium alloys,

47
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.440
the mirror shape is important to enveloping the sun in a giant spherical

48
00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:12.040
shell wouldn't work because that would refocus light back to the sun,

49
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.570
heating it up and creating all sorts of unpleasant problems. Instead,

50
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.040
we use a parabola which sends most of the photons around the sun and in the same

51
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:21.820
direction,

52
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.710
which maximizes thrust to prevent accidentally burning or freezing

53
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.000
earth with too much or too little sunlight. The only safe place to build a Scot,

54
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.430
our Forester is over the sun's poles.

55
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.780
This means we can only move the sun vertically in the plane of the solar system

56
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.070
and one direction in the Milky way, which limits our travel options, a base,

57
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.650
but that is basically it for a civilization capable of building a

58
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:50.740
Dyson sphere. This is a relatively simple endeavor,

59
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.130
not complicated,

60
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.210
just very hard to build at full cool.

61
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.870
The soda system could probably be moved by about a hundred light years,

62
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.000
over 230 million years. Over a few billion years.

63
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.840
It gives us near complete control over the sun's albeit in the galaxy.

64
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.640
But in the short term,

65
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.850
this might not be fast enough to Dodge a deadly supernova.

66
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.490
That's why we thought we could do better.

67
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.540
So we asked our astrophysicist friends,

68
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.870
if he could design a fastest at an engine for this video,

69
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.910
he did and wrote a paper about his that's been published in a peer review

70
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.060
journal. You can find it in our sources document.

71
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.370
We're going to call our new starter engine, the Kaplan thruster.

72
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.010
It works a lot like a traditional rocket shoot exhaust one way to push yourself

73
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.873
the other.

74
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.800
It's a large space station platform powered by a Dyson sphere that gathers

75
00:04:49.801 --> 00:04:52.140
matter from the sun to power nuclear fusion.

76
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.300
It shoots out a very fast jet of particles that nearly 1% the speed of light

77
00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.770
out of the solar system.

78
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.730
A second jet pushes the sun along like a tugboat.

79
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.830
The cap and thruster requires a lot of fuel millions of tons per second.

80
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.960
To gather this fuel,

81
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.000
our thruster uses very large electromagnetic fields to funnel hydrogen and

82
00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:17.370
helium from the solar wind into the engine.

83
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.080
The solar wind alone doesn't provide enough fuel though.

84
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.430
And that's where the Dyson's fare comes in using its power.

85
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.660
Sunlight can be refocused to the surface of the sun, this heat,

86
00:05:30.661 --> 00:05:32.670
small regions to extreme temperatures,

87
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.490
lifting billions of tons of mass off the sun.

88
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.320
This mass can be collected and separated into hydrogen and helium.

89
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.380
The helium is burned explosively in Thermo nuclear fusion reactors,

90
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.660
a jet of radioactive oxygen at a temperature of nearly a billion degrees is

91
00:05:51.661 --> 00:05:55.980
expelled and becomes our primary source of propulsion from our Stella engine

92
00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.510
to the engine from just crashing into the sun.

93
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.810
It needs to balance itself to do this.

94
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.400
We accelerate the collected hydrogen with electromagnetic fields using particle

95
00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:12.230
accelerators and shoot a jet back at the sun. This balances,

96
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.170
the thruster and transfers the thrust of our engine.

97
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.740
Back to the sun in as little as a million years,

98
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.800
this engine can move the sun by 50 light years,

99
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.360
more than enough to Dodge a supernova at full throttle.

100
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.890
The soda system can be completely redirected in its galactic obese in

101
00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:35.420
10 million years, but wait, will we use up the sun this way?

102
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.183
Fortunately,

103
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.990
the sun is so massive that even billions of tons of material will barely scratch

104
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:43.640
the surface. In fact,

105
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.590
this mega structure will actually extend our son's life since lower mass

106
00:06:48.591 --> 00:06:50.030
stars, burn slower,

107
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.350
keeping the soda system inhabitable for many more billions of years

108
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.420
with a cabin for us to,

109
00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:01.430
we could turn the entire solar system into our spaceship. For example,

110
00:07:01.431 --> 00:07:06.230
by orbiting backwards in the galaxy and colonizing hundreds or thousands of

111
00:07:06.231 --> 00:07:07.820
stars as we pass by them,

112
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.460
it may even be possible to escape the galaxy and tiny and expand beyond the

113
00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:14.294
Milky way.

114
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.370
Stella engines are the kind of machines built by civilizations thinking not in

115
00:07:19.371 --> 00:07:22.160
terms of years or decades, but eons.

116
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.950
Since we know that our son will die.

117
00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:29.540
One day a stellar engine could allow the far future descendants of humans to

118
00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:33.950
travel to other stars without ever having to venture into the terrifying

119
00:07:33.951 --> 00:07:36.110
darkness of interstellar space.

120
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.740
Until we build a Stella engine where a drift and subject to the whims of the

121
00:07:42.741 --> 00:07:46.730
galactic seat, we may not like where it leads us.

122
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.680
Maybe our descendants will set sail and become an interstellar

123
00:07:51.681 --> 00:07:54.380
species for millions of years to come.

124
00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.680
This was our last video for the year 12,019 of this year in error.

125
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.970
And what a year, it was so much stuff happened to everywhere,

126
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.740
to so many different people,

127
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.610
calendars and holidays adjust imaginary,

128
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.900
but they help us to cut our lives into pieces that our brains can handle.

129
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:20.750
We're leaving 12,019 behind with a weird mixture of disillusion and hope

130
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.790
the world is screwed up, but we can fix it in a few days.

131
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.210
This year will be over and we'll get to try again.

132
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:34.340
Thank you for watching our videos and for sticking around for so many years.

133
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:37.160
See you all in 12,020.
