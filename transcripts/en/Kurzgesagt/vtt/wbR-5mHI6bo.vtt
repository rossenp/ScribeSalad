00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.950
<v 0>Climate change is just too much. There's never any good news,</v>

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.530
only graphs to get more and more rant.

3
00:00:07.531 --> 00:00:12.000
And the angry almost every year breaks some horrible record from the

4
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:15.150
harshest heat waves to the most rapid glassy melt.

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.090
It's endless and relentless.

6
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.040
We've known for decades that rapid climate change is being caused by the release

7
00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:27.960
of greenhouse gases. But instead of reducing them in 2019,

8
00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:31.950
the world was emitting 50% more CO2 than in the year.

9
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:36.840
2000 and emissions are still rising. Why is that?

10
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.800
Why is it so hard to just stop emitting these gases?

11
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.773
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

12
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.470
<v 0>Our collective CO2 emissions can be expressed as a product of four factors and</v>

13
00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:55.850
their relationship with each other.

14
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.530
Two of them explain why worldwide CO2 emissions are still rising.

15
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.420
And to explain how we can stop that population size,

16
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.390
economic growth, energy intensity,

17
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.310
and emissions per energy unit produced. Number one,

18
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.630
population size.

19
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.130
People need food homes and clothing,

20
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.170
and they demand luxury products from iPhones to $1 cheeseburgers,

21
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.730
more people, higher CO2 emissions. It's a very simple equation.

22
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.840
The global population is growing and according to the UN,

23
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.500
it will level off at about 11 billion in 2,100,

24
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.200
which is 40% more than today.

25
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.390
The only way to slow down this growth is investment in health care and access to

26
00:01:44.391 --> 00:01:47.600
contraception and education in developing countries.

27
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.090
But even with massive investment,

28
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.900
it will take a few decades for the effects of lower birth rates to manifest

29
00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:54.734
themselves.

30
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.700
So the global population will keep growing for the foreseeable future.

31
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.290
And as a consequence,

32
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.160
global CO2 emissions will rise over the next few decades.

33
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.940
Number two growth or getting richer,

34
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:13.220
but it's not just about our numbers, the richer and more developed.

35
00:02:13.221 --> 00:02:18.140
We are the more emissions our lifestyle produces a programmer in the U

36
00:02:18.141 --> 00:02:22.070
S has a higher CO2 footprint than 50 farmers in Uganda.

37
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.430
The world's wealth is growing almost everywhere.

38
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.850
And although it's far from evenly distributed,

39
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.930
economic growth has led to the highest standards of living and the largest

40
00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:35.840
reduction and extreme poverty in human history.

41
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.520
Growth has become the dominant mantra of the world's economies,

42
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.190
no matter what kind of political system they have.

43
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.020
It's unlikely that rich countries will give up the concept of growth anytime

44
00:02:48.021 --> 00:02:48.854
soon,

45
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.150
but even if they were to developing countries that want to become rich too,

46
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.740
for billions of people, the end of growth would probably mean staying.

47
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.190
And so developing countries are not willing to stop growing their economies all

48
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:03.551
in all.

49
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:07.960
We can be sure the growth as a guiding economic ideology is not going to go

50
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:08.320
away.

51
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.090
Anytime soon more countries and their citizens around the world will

52
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:14.410
grow and become richer.

53
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.770
While the richer economies will continue to grow their wealth.

54
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.450
There are some signs that growth can be decoupled from CO2 emissions,

55
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.470
but we're not close to that yet. As a consequence of this growth,

56
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.100
CO2 emissions will rise. Okay?

57
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:33.490
So far we've learned that because of population growth and economic growth,

58
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.640
humanity's CO2 emissions will increase,

59
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.520
which is the opposite of what should be happening.

60
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.110
We need to slow peak and then reduce annual emissions.

61
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.610
The next two factors describe how we can actually do this.

62
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.450
Number three energy intensity intensity describes

63
00:03:54.451 --> 00:03:56.340
how efficiently we use energy.

64
00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.680
A street food vendor in rural Brazil might burn coal to cook what a street food

65
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.670
vendor and France might use an induction stove powered by nuclear energy.

66
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.160
The latter is way more efficient.

67
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.990
The more efficient something is the less energy we need to do something.

68
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.100
Be it powering a metropolitan area or grilling a combat.

69
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.720
So making our technology more efficient and coming up with more efficient ways

70
00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:26.130
to organize our societies is one of the most important ways to reduce the modern

71
00:04:26.131 --> 00:04:27.780
world's CO2 dependency.

72
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.430
This can mean everything from reducing power consumption with AI,

73
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.110
the electrification of the transportation and industrial sectors or sustainable

74
00:04:37.111 --> 00:04:38.010
country production.

75
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.950
The opportunities for improvement are almost limitless and human ingenuity

76
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.120
can run wild,

77
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.800
but we know that increasing efficiency alone will not be enough.

78
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.930
Mostly for three reasons. One directs rebound effects.

79
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.340
This means that once something becomes more efficient, it's used more.

80
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.960
And so overall the increased efficiency does not lead to a reduction as

81
00:05:03.961 --> 00:05:06.930
impressive as you would first think or worse.

82
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.190
Sometimes more efficiency makes humans not use less of a resource,

83
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.110
but more of it when planes became more fuel efficient ticket prices,

84
00:05:16.111 --> 00:05:19.080
decreased, and more people started to travel by plane.

85
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.630
So making things more efficient does not automatically mean less energy use

86
00:05:24.631 --> 00:05:27.600
in total. It might have the opposite effect.

87
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.140
Two in direct rebound effects. Sometimes when you save money on a thing,

88
00:05:34.141 --> 00:05:37.890
that's become more efficient, you might spend it elsewhere. For example,

89
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.780
if you buy a more fuel efficient car,

90
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.460
you save money on fuel and end up with extra funds in your bank account that you

91
00:05:44.461 --> 00:05:48.480
might spend on a vacation and take a flight with. So in the end,

92
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.130
you might actually emit more CO2 despite getting a more efficient car

93
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.610
three. And lastly, the more you optimize for efficiency,

94
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.560
the harder and more expensive it becomes to get more efficient. So over time,

95
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.550
the return on investment slows down. And with many technologies,

96
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.680
we are already pretty efficient,

97
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.370
but regardless of how efficient we make our economies,

98
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.740
as long as we need at least some energy,

99
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.760
we will have emissions efficiency alone.

100
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.400
Won't create a zero carbon world.

101
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.110
This brings us to our last factor. Number four,

102
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.300
CO2 emissions per energy unit used, or our global carbon footprint

103
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:38.120
human-ness is global carbon footprint is the CO2 released per energy unit

104
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:41.240
generated. For example, coal plants release much,

105
00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:44.330
much more CO2 than solar power per units of energy.

106
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.640
This relationship is crystal clear.

107
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:52.160
The more fossil fuels we burn the higher our CO2 output fossil

108
00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:56.210
fuels are the greatest lever humanity has right now. Of course,

109
00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.620
it's impossible to shut down coal and oil overnight without throwing society

110
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:01.454
into chaos.

111
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.170
But the reality is that we're not doing nearly enough to keep fossil fuels in

112
00:07:06.171 --> 00:07:09.110
the ground and use lower carbon alternatives.

113
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.090
We need to do two things to speed the transition away from fossil fuels.

114
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.310
First, we need to use the real leverage we have today with today's technology.

115
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.940
There are a lot of things we can do extremely quickly.

116
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.090
We can leave nuclear power plants online longer.

117
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.590
We can cut subsidies to the fossil fuel industry and funnel them into

118
00:07:30.591 --> 00:07:31.424
renewables.

119
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.740
We can price carbon emissions harshly and increase the price each year to create

120
00:07:36.741 --> 00:07:39.530
strong incentives for the world's industries to transition.

121
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:45.110
We can enforce strict standards for energy efficiency and for any type of new

122
00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:48.800
construction, we can phase out fossil fuel vehicles.

123
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.121
Next.

124
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:54.950
We also need to invent new and Vassar technology without new

125
00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:56.600
technologies and innovation.

126
00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.110
It will be impossible to achieve a zero CO2 emission world.

127
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:04.520
Be it from technologies like carbon capture or a new generation of nuclear power

128
00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:08.900
plants to new batteries that revolutionize the energy storage from renewables,

129
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:13.790
but innovation takes time, years, and decades.

130
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.300
And we don't have this time. Every year,

131
00:08:17.301 --> 00:08:19.610
we keep adding more carbon to the atmosphere.

132
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.970
This means we can't keep relying on innovation alone.

133
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:28.280
We need to find ways to reduce emissions today while we invent what we will need

134
00:08:28.281 --> 00:08:32.390
in the future, the less fossil fuel we burn over the next few years,

135
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:37.160
the more time we give innovation to catch up the more low carbon energy

136
00:08:37.161 --> 00:08:38.720
infrastructure we build today,

137
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.920
the more we can compensate for economic growth and the people born today,

138
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.450
the more coal power plants in construction, we stopped from being finished.

139
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.490
The more CO2 we save,

140
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.420
neither innovation nor the alternatives we're using today.

141
00:08:53.421 --> 00:08:55.770
Alone can solve rapid change,

142
00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.390
but innovation together with a decisive move away from fossil fuels,

143
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:03.810
where it's possible today could do is solving.

144
00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:06.000
Climate change will be complicated.

145
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.450
We have to account for the needs of billions of people.

146
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:14.460
And the reality that right now, society runs mostly on fossil fuels.

147
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:19.770
This will not change overnight, but it needs to change as quickly as possible.

148
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.680
And it is still very much possible.

149
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:28.770
We'll look at different aspects of climate change and how to solve it in more
