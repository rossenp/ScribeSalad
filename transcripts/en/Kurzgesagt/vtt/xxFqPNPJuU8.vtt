00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.420
<v 0>For the fifth time we present to you the human error calendar for the year,</v>

2
00:00:03.421 --> 00:00:08.100
12,021 this time. It's all about the journey of humanity.

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.550
Beginning, tens of thousands of years ago,

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.440
leading into the revolution of agriculture to ancient high civilizations

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.970
and the beginning of modern times culminating in a vision for our future.

6
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.190
You can get the limited edition now until we set out and then never again,

7
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.630
as always the calendar features 12 illustrated pages printed on high quality

8
00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:35.490
paper in Europe and the U S and this year, the cover is especially shiny.

9
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.170
Not only does the calendar look great on walls and makes it easier to dream

10
00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:44.010
about a glorious future and realize how far we've come as a species.

11
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.130
It's also the best way to support Kazaks.

12
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.960
The calendar enables us to put in the time our videos need and release them for

13
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:54.630
free for everyone. If you want,

14
00:00:54.631 --> 00:00:58.110
you can get the Canada with a hoodie or infographic posters or plushy.

15
00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.490
We've met a few deals for you.

16
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.650
Thank you so much to the thousands of people who get the calendar every year and

17
00:01:04.651 --> 00:01:07.230
to the burbs who love what we try to do on this channel.

18
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.610
We wish you a happy year, 12,021,

19
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.600
and let's all hope that it will be less exciting than 12,020.
