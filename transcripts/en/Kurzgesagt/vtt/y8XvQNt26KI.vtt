00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.500
<v 0>Casually watching a video on YouTube, on a computer,</v>

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.010
more powerful than anything. Humanity could build a few decades ago,

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.450
this progress and all the wonderful machines you take for granted are built on a

4
00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:17.100
few rare and precious materials with names like Terbium neodymium or

5
00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:17.934
tantalum.

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.320
Getting these raw materials from the ground into your devices is ugly.

7
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.340
The mining industry is responsible for air and water pollution and the

8
00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:28.200
destruction of entire landscapes,

9
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.600
dangerous chemicals like Sinai sulfuric acid or chlorine are used to extract

10
00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:34.410
the resources,

11
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.150
harming biodiversity workers and locals and rare resources are

12
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:43.290
also political tools when countries restrict access to them to get their way.

13
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.940
But what if we could replace the mining industry on earth with a clean process

14
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.240
that can't harm anyone? Well, we can,

15
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.120
all we need to do is look up.

16
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.033
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

17
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.900
<v 0>[Inaudible] are millions of trillions of tons of rocks,</v>

18
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.910
metals and ice leftovers from the cloud that became the planets 4.5 billion

19
00:01:10.911 --> 00:01:11.744
years ago.

20
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.100
They can be as small as a meter or protoplanets the size of entire countries.

21
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.540
Most of them are concentrated in the asteroid belt and the Kuiper belt while

22
00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:24.800
hundreds of thousands more do their own thing between the planets as space

23
00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:28.550
travel is becoming more feasible. Scientists and economists have begun.

24
00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:31.100
Looking at the resources found in these asteroids,

25
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.780
even relatively small metallic asteroids that may contain trillions worth of

26
00:01:35.781 --> 00:01:39.920
industrial and precious metals like platinum and bigger asteroids,

27
00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:44.420
like 16 psyche could contain enough iron nickel to cover the world's metal needs

28
00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:47.930
for millions of years. At current market prices,

29
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.550
the rat rule materials alone would be worth quadrillions of dollars. Well,

30
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.730
not really, but technically for example,

31
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.750
there are more than 20 million tons of gold in the oceans water worth,

32
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.420
roughly 750 trillion us dollars,

33
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.440
but filtering out the gold would be so expensive that you'd lose money sending

34
00:02:06.441 --> 00:02:10.400
it right now. Asteroid mining has exactly this problem.

35
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.950
It's too expensive to replace mining on earth.

36
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.300
Billions of dollars worth of valuable resources in space are worthless.

37
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.080
If it costs trillions to get them what makes it so hard?

38
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.380
The principles behind mining an asteroid, a simple,

39
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.660
the basic idea is to choose the asteroid,

40
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.440
move it to a place where it's easy to process and then take it apart to turn

41
00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:32.900
into useful products. Unfortunately,

42
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.530
all of this collides with fundamental problems humans have yet to solve,

43
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.840
going to space is expensive.

44
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.830
It costs thousands of dollars in rocket fuel for each kilogram,

45
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.630
just to reach a low earth orbit going further out into deep space costs

46
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:48.650
thousands more.

47
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.400
We need cheapest space travel to make asteroid mining profitable.

48
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.470
One solution is to switch from classical rocket to electric spaceships.

49
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.350
We already use rocket engines for many of the space probes on science missions.

50
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.520
In principle,

51
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.510
we only need to build bigger ones while electrical engines are not powerful

52
00:03:07.511 --> 00:03:12.130
enough to fly to space. They require only a tiny amount of fuel to go very far.

53
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.510
Once they're in space,

54
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.430
this means we don't need to spend a lot of money on fuel only to transport fuel

55
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.270
into space. This doesn't solve the whole cost problem,

56
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.610
but it makes it easiest to start our first mission.

57
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.970
Now that we have an electric asteroid mining spaceship,

58
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.400
we need to find the right asteroid and get it there.

59
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.750
We've already successfully visited asteroids with space probes and even

60
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:38.170
collected samples still to make it easier and cheaper.

61
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.310
Our first targets will probably beat near earth asteroids asteroids

62
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.680
well near earth. After a few months of travel,

63
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.600
our spaceship finally arrives at our,

64
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.290
the restaurant weirdly formed littered with small numbers at craters.

65
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.720
It hasn't changed much for billions of years.

66
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.220
The first thing that needs to be done is to secure the asteroid and stop it from

67
00:03:59.221 --> 00:04:00.054
spinning.

68
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.900
There are multiple ways to do this like vaporizing material with a laser or

69
00:04:03.901 --> 00:04:07.800
stopping the rotation with thrusters. Once we have a stable asteroid,

70
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.070
we need to wait. Orbital mechanics are complicated,

71
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.430
but if you push something in the right direction at exactly the right moment,

72
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.980
you can move very big things with very little.

73
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.030
So we wait for exactly the right moment,

74
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.270
fires it thrusters and nudges the astroid into a trajectory that takes it near

75
00:04:27.271 --> 00:04:28.104
our moon.

76
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.980
The moon is useful because we can borrow it's gravitational pull to put the

77
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.900
asteroid in a stable or wet earth, which saves even more fuel. Again,

78
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.280
the trip takes months.

79
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.640
All the time since our ship was launched has not been wasted.

80
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.990
The first space mining and processing equipment has been installed in always,

81
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.570
and is now carefully moving towards the asteroid.

82
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.730
The processor works very differently than on earth. Giant mirrors, focus,

83
00:04:53.731 --> 00:04:58.500
sunlight and heat up asteroid rock to boil out the gases grinders break up the

84
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.760
dry rocks into gravel and dust and centrifuges separate dense from light

85
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.840
elements.

86
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.700
Even if we only extract 0.01% of the asteroids mass in precious metals,

87
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.850
this is still several times more than you'd get from the same amount of,

88
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.280
or on the ground. But what now?

89
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.610
How do we get our precious metals safely back to ground?

90
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.050
There are a few ways like loading it into reusable rockets that return to earth

91
00:05:22.051 --> 00:05:25.710
from space. Or if our processor contains 3d printers,

92
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.470
we can print a faster and cheaper delivery system.

93
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.590
Heat shielded capsules filled with gas bubbles.

94
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.760
These can just be dropped into the oceans where ships tow them away.

95
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.830
This could be the starting point of humanity's first real steps towards

96
00:05:40.831 --> 00:05:42.390
colonizing this solar system.

97
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.980
As our infrastructure and experience grows down,

98
00:05:45.981 --> 00:05:50.550
missions get more and more sophisticated parts and fuel produced on asteroids.

99
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.410
Don't have to be launched from earth at all.

100
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.250
The first mining operation makes the second one easier and so on.

101
00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.170
While space industry grows and precious materials become cheaper.

102
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.810
Eventually we could stop mining on earth.

103
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.150
Even the idea of toxic mining down here might become something weird.

104
00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:11.210
And acronystic like having an open fire in your living room.

105
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.710
Landscapes ravaged by pollution will heal while the technological wonders were

106
00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:20.600
used to get cheaper and less toxic to make none of this is science

107
00:06:20.601 --> 00:06:21.200
fiction.

108
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.100
We don't need fancy materials or new physics to make asteroid mining happen.

109
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.620
We could start building this future today.

110
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.830
All we need is an initial quote.

111
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.880
<v 1>Maybe.</v>

112
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.870
<v 0>You could also use a little nudge not to pursue anything as ambitious as</v>

113
00:06:37.871 --> 00:06:40.750
asteroid mining, just to try something new and fun.

114
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:45.580
Let us give you some tailwind there. We partnered with Skillshare,

115
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.570

skills, like graphic design, music, photography, illustration, and animation.

117
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.260
They have something for every skill level.

For example,

122
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.360
we've made a couple of Skillshare classes that teach you how we animated scenes

123

from our videos, with the video lessons, classes and hands-on projects,

124
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.320
or if you'd rather come up with your own characters to breathe life into,
