00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.030
<v 0>When you think of Australia, you might think of kangaroos,</v>

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.800
koalas or premium Australian beer, like Foster's lager. Sorry,

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:08.460
Aussies.

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.960
But another thing you might think of is that distinct Australian way or ways of

5
00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:13.920
speaking English,

6
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.240
the story of Australian English begins with the arrival of European settlers in

7
00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:20.100
Australia in 1788,

8
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.850
convicts from Britain and Ireland were exiled to new South Wales,

9
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.340
which was founded as an overseas penal colony.

10
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.710
They weren't all ruthless criminals, mind you.

11
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.850
Many of them were only guilty of theft and some of them were children over

12
00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:36.570
160,000 convicts were sent there over the next 80 years,

13
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.840
mainly working class people from the major cities of England,

14
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.910
as well as Scotland, Wales, and Ireland.

15
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.760
There were also many free settlers who joined them.

16
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.290
The significance of this is that people speaking different English dialects from

17
00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:53.490
all over Britain and Ireland were essentially thrown together in the same place

18
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.590
where they had to learn to understand one another.

19
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.940
Remember back then there was no radio or television to familiarize people with

20
00:00:59.941 --> 00:01:02.760
different accents in order to understand each other. Well,

21
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.550
they had to learn to speak in a way that was less regional.

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.740
This resulted in dialect leveling dialectal variations were removed from their

23
00:01:10.741 --> 00:01:11.574
speech.

24
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.570
You could say that the core of Australian English is a compromise between the

25
00:01:15.571 --> 00:01:19.140
various regional dialects of Britain and Ireland. And since then,

26
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.950
Australian English has developed its own features, words, and expressions.

27
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.100
It has also been influenced by additional waves of immigration.

28
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.080
Since the days of the penal colony ended.

29
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.240
There are basically three varieties of Australian English, broad general,

30
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.310
and cultivated Australian English.

31
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.990
They essentially form an accent continuum with the speaker's accent, depending,

32
00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:43.380
mostly on whether they grew up in a rural area or an urban area.

33
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.220
There are socioeconomic background and perhaps the kind of subculture they

34
00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:51.780
identify with broad Australian English has the features that people outside of

35
00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:55.230
Australia tend to associate with Australian English. You know,

36
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:57.630
when they think of Steve Irwin, the crocodile Hunter,

37
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.460
or maybe Paul Hogan and crocodile Dundee, and just a word of warning strains,

38
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.130
never say this, throw another shrimp on the Barbie,

39
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.440
unless they're taking the out of you.

40
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.980
Plaguing the PIs is an expression used in Britain and Australia.

41
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.440
That means to make fun of someone or mess with them.

42
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.060
It's not used in North American English, I'm Canadian. And I sometimes use it,

43
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.760
but that's because I've picked it up from some Aussie friends of mine.

44
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.870
Here are a few examples of broad Australian English that you'll probably only

45
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:28.950
hear in rural areas or maybe amongst older people or amongst, um,

46
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.580
is it politically correct to say Ockers and bogans?

47
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.140
<v 1>And, uh, does that mean no? Nah, yeah.</v>

48
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.890
<v 0>Women are sometimes referred to as Sheilas.</v>

49
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.180
Somehow that one particular name Sheila came to represent women in general.

50
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.100
For example, if I say, Hey man, where's Liam in theory, I might get this reply.

51
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.670
<v 1>Yeah, he's over the Avenue. Chat with some Sheila strewth,</v>

52
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.980
she's a bit of a loca. Struth.

53
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.490
<v 0>Is used as an to show surprise.</v>

54
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.110
It actually originated in the UK and is a contraction of God's truth.

55
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.380
But now it's used much more in Australia Struth. Well,

56
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:12.190
at least in broad Australian English, a similar word is Crocky.

57
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.790
This is also used as an interjection to show surprise. But again,

58
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:18.070
this is limited to broad Australian English,

59
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.320
unless someone's taken the plaguing,

60
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:25.000
the pice cultivated Australian English is spoken by less than 10% of Aussies.

61
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.570
Non Aussies might mistake it for British received pronunciation.

62
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:29.740
It has many fewer,

63
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:34.060
obviously Australian features general Australian English is spoken by the

64
00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:36.610
majority of Aussies. And as somewhere between the two,

65
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.180
these different varieties of Australian English are not regional.

66
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.021
For the most part.

67
00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:43.930
It's hard to tell the difference between people from Brisbane, Melbourne,

68
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:46.270
Sydney, and other cities based on their accents.

69
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.780
Some people also argue that there's a fourth accent,

70
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.630
the accent of the outer suburbs of major cities,

71
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.320
which developed among communities that have immigrated to Australia since the

72
00:03:56.321 --> 00:03:57.250
second world war,

73
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.030
this kind of accent is often perceived as an immigrant accent though.

74
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.510
It's spoken among the children and grandchildren of immigrants and crosses

75
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:06.280
ethnic boundaries in those neighborhoods.

76
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.110
Most of the examples after this point in the video will be more or less general

77
00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:13.420
Australian English spelling,

78
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.320
Australian English normally follows British spelling conventions rather than

79
00:04:17.321 --> 00:04:21.310
American. That means in words like organize and authorize,

80
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.150
the ISC spelling is normally preferred to the Izod. IE spelling,

81
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.050
words like color and flavor are spelled with O U R rather than,

82
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.850
or words like center and liter are spelled with R E rather than ER,

83
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.810
and so on.

84
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.380
The reason why American English uses different spellings from British English is

85
00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:42.220
because of Noah Webster whose dictionary published in 1828,

86
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.880
chose certain variant spellings to be the American ones in order to make

87
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:47.320
American English distinct.

88
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.270
This was specific to the U S so it didn't affect Australia. Pronunciation,

89
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.530
Australian accents are Arliss accents or non rhotic accents,

90
00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.490
meaning that the R sound is not pronounced at the end of a syllable or word,

91
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.070
unless there's a word beginning with a vowel after it.

92
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.400
This is the same as in most accents of England. For example,

93
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.890
K compare that to my rhotic Canadian accent care care.

94
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.980
I don't care. I don't care different.

95
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.490
The sense of English are mainly distinguished by differences in vowels.

96
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.220
And that's the case with Australian English. For instance,

97
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.630
Aussie English basically has two a sounds, ah, and ah,

98
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.820
some words are pronounced with, ah,

99
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.150
in both Australian and North American English, for example,

100
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.790
cat cat nap, nap.

101
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.690
But other words that I would pronounce with an sound are often pronounced

102
00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:41.550
differently with a long, ah, in Australian English. For example, math,

103
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.560
both laugh, laugh.

104
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.390
This is because of a split that occurred in the early modern English vowel app

105
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.640
in Southern England. The sound began to change to a long OSS out as in father,

106
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.380
before certain sounds. This is referred to as broad a,

107
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.570
this change made its way to Australia,

108
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.430
but the vowel became a central vowel rather than a back vowel, ah, path,

109
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.560
rather than the British word boss.

110
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.310
This distinction is not used across the board in Australia, in English though.

111
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.890
It has the most influence in South Australia.

112
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.050
The most noticeable feature of Australian English pronunciation is probably its

113
00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:21.440
diphthongs and Australian greeting. I'm sure you've heard is.

114
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.640
<v 1>Good. Or.</v>

115
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.200
<v 0>It's really only Aussies who use this as a greeting. But if I tried to say it,</v>

116
00:06:27.201 --> 00:06:31.820
it would sound like good day, mate, listen to the difference in the diphthongs.

117
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.080
The vowel sounds good.

118
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.800
<v 1>Good. I mate, mate.</v>

119
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.250
<v 0>The word day is not to be confused with the word die, die.</v>

120
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.430
The equivalent of American and British I is I for example,

121
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.293
price.

122
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.100
<v 1>Price, hide, hide.</v>

123
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.330
<v 0>There's also a different Australian pronunciation of the diff long that I would</v>

124
00:06:52.331 --> 00:06:56.170
pronounce as owl, Australian say something like out.

125
00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.890
<v 1>How, how downtown downtown.</v>

126
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.110
<v 0>There's also a diphthong that I pronounce as oil Australian say something more</v>

127
00:07:05.111 --> 00:07:09.700
like oily boy, boy, the Aussie sound is less open.

128
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.310
Another is the diphthong O as in boat, Australian say,

129
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:20.200
but there are some characteristic features of intonation in Australian

130
00:07:20.201 --> 00:07:23.470
English. One such feature is called high rising terminal.

131
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:28.060
This means that Australians often say clauses within a statement with intonation

132
00:07:28.061 --> 00:07:29.320
that rises at the end,

133
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.860
like a yes or no question and North American or British English.

134
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.760
In the following example, you can hear it at the end of the first clause.

135
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.140
<v 1>Uh, met robo down the pock. Um,</v>

136
00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:45.100
we met up with a couple of mates and uh, played a bit of footy.

137
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.120
<v 0>This kind of intonation is standard in Australia. These days,</v>

138
00:07:49.121 --> 00:07:52.510
you might hear it sometimes in North America and the UK as well though.

139
00:07:52.511 --> 00:07:54.010
A lot of people find it annoying.

140
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:58.870
You might hear it referred to as uptalk vocabulary while the vast,

141
00:07:58.871 --> 00:08:03.160
vast majority of Australian English vocabulary is the same as another varieties.

142
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.080
It does have its own word preferences,

143
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.020
as well as words and expressions that are uniquely Ozzie.

144
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:12.550
The most famous Ozzy phrase just might be good. I might, as we heard before,

145
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.470
just like in the UK, Ozzy is often referred to friends as mates, as in the UK,

146
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.400
the word mate is used in contexts where North Americans would say friend,

147
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.070
or maybe man when addressing someone casually.

148
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.530
But unlike in the UK in Australia,

149
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.220
mate is not limited to casual situations or to your peers.

150
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.390
You can use it with older people or people with a higher rank or position than

151
00:08:34.391 --> 00:08:38.320
you. This reflects the overwhelmingly casual nature of Aussies and the way they

152
00:08:38.321 --> 00:08:41.650
communicate to inquire about someone's wellbeing.

153
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:46.540
You might hear the mask as a North American. This sounds strange to my years,

154
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:50.500
we ask how's it going rather than how are you going? Similarly,

155
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.440
when you apologize and Ozzy might say, you're right,

156
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:55.150
rather than that's all right,

157
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.350
which is what I would say the first time I heard this, I was confused. Like,

158
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.180
why are you telling me I'm all right.

159
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:05.790
Another expression that's likely to confuse us North Americans is who is

160
00:09:05.791 --> 00:09:09.750
she referring to? Well, no one it's referring to the situation.

161
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.290
I would say, it'll be all right, or it'll be fine.

162
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.370
When Aussies want to get someone's attention, you might hear them say,

163
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.330
I would say, Hey instead, amen.

164
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:28.170
Third income. Or just think of this expression means genuine, honest, or true.

165
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.650
It can also be used as a question income for real.

166
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:36.210
And it can be used as an adjective to describe someone he's a fading, Moz.

167
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.910
This is like saying he's a true Ozzie.

168
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.690
I've come across a couple of possible etymologies of this expression.

169
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:46.680
One of them States that it comes from a dialectal word of England, dinkum,

170
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.240
meaning hard work. Another etymology States that it comes from Cantonese,

171
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.500
which was spoken by prospectors in the early goldmines Dean gum,

172
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.180
meaning real gold though.

173
00:09:57.181 --> 00:09:59.730
I tend to think the first etymology is the correct one.

174
00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:04.290
Remember that sentence from a moment ago, he's a fading Moz. Well,

175
00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:05.550
we could expand that a little.

176
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.710
<v 1>He's a fed income, true blue Aussie mate.</v>

177
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.820
<v 0>I might say he's a real genuine Ozzie, true blue.</v>

178
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:17.870
This phrase is kind of like fair dinkum, meaning true as in genuine,

179
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.800
but also has the meaning of loyal and to all the people with that positive

180
00:10:21.801 --> 00:10:26.300
personality trait. I say good on ya. Good on you is what Ozzy say.

181
00:10:26.301 --> 00:10:29.660
When they want to show they're impressed or they respect something good you've

182
00:10:29.661 --> 00:10:33.950
done. I would probably say nice work or good job from what I understand.

183
00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.350
Good Anya comes from high Burno English.

184
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.420
That is Irish English note that good on you can be used both sincerely and

185
00:10:41.421 --> 00:10:43.310
sarcastically. For example,

186
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.970
let's say I'm bragging about how much of a pimp I am and how I scored last

187
00:10:46.971 --> 00:10:47.804
night. You're.

188
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.880
<v 1>Out. I might good on you when.</v>

189
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.120
<v 0>You say thanks and Aussie might reply with no worries,</v>

190
00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.000
which is like saying no problem or don't worry about it.

191
00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.270
No worries can also be used in response to an apology.

192
00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:03.890
No worries is a way of life in Australia and something of a national motto.

193
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.400
Aussies tend to be lighthearted and not take things too seriously.

194
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:10.610
But if you're one of those people who tends to complain or sulk,

195
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:15.320
or if you're easily offended, you might be called a soak or as an adjective.

196
00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:18.950
Soki Aussies love to use diminutive words,

197
00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:21.260
special forms of words that show endearment.

198
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.040
This is usually done through shortening a word and adding a special suffix to

199
00:11:25.041 --> 00:11:29.810
it. Afternoon becomes this afternoon becomes the Saba

200
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:34.790
or Saba BBQ becomes Bobby mosquito becomes

201
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:39.590
Muzzy. Football becomes footy. Cigarette becomes Siggy.

202
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.810
Sandwich becomes Sanger.

203
00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:46.220
Postman becomes posty garbage man becomes GABA.

204
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:50.450
Christmas becomes Chrissy chocolate biscuit,

205
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:55.570
Chucky Beaky surface station becomes server and that's for a service station,

206
00:11:55.571 --> 00:11:59.830
meaning a gas station or a petrol station McDonald's becomes

207
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.860
MCAS. And this is ubiquitous throughout Australia.

208
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:07.170
Isolation becomes also as in quarantine,

209
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.730
due to the 19 [inaudible].

210
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:14.740
There were also some words in Aussie English that originates in Aboriginal

211
00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:16.030
languages of Australia.

212
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:20.650
One example you might hear in particular in broad Australian English is hard

213
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:25.570
yakka, which means hard work. Yakka is a word from the yoga language,

214
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.670
which used to be spoken in the Brisbane region.

215
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:31.990
This word made its way into Australian English through the English based pigeon

216
00:12:31.991 --> 00:12:36.340
language that was originally used between European settlers and aboriginals that

217
00:12:36.341 --> 00:12:39.040
pigeon later developed into Australian Creole,

218
00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:43.270
which is still spoken by around 20,000 people today in the Northern territory,

219
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:47.230
there are some other well-known nouns that represent specific things in the

220
00:12:47.231 --> 00:12:50.710
Australian environment like Dinga or glimmering,

221
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.620
which come from the extinct Dharug language,

222
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.750
which used to be spoken in the Sydney area.

223
00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.490
Australian English is largely the same as other varieties of English,

224
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.930
but with their own accents,

225
00:13:01.931 --> 00:13:05.980
vocabulary and attitude that reflect the laid back nature of Aussies,

226
00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:10.180
endearing and friendly are two words that come to mind when I think of Aussies

227
00:13:10.181 --> 00:13:12.550
and their way of speaking English. Oh,

228
00:13:12.551 --> 00:13:15.850
one final feature of Australian English that we can get into is they're

229
00:13:15.851 --> 00:13:20.230
extremely liberal use of the word though.

230
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.480
YouTube might ban me if I talk about that.

231
00:13:22.481 --> 00:13:27.250
So maybe I should just move on to the question of the day for speakers of Aussie

232
00:13:27.251 --> 00:13:27.910
English.

233
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:31.630
I'm sure there are heaps of Ozzy words and expressions that I didn't have time

234
00:13:31.631 --> 00:13:34.660
to mention in the video. So what other ones would you like to add?

235
