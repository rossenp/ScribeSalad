00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.250
<v 0>Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Lang focus channel. And my name is Paul. Today.</v>

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.940
We're going to talk about a language that partially descended from English,

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.830
but is not actually English.

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.180
The language is talk peace in an English based Creole language,

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.250
sometimes referred to as pigeon or pigeon English talk piecing is one of the

6
00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:22.320
official languages of Papa new Guinea,

7
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.760
which is located in the Southwestern Pacific ocean, just North of Australia.

8
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.400
It's other official languages are English,

9
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.730
which is not spoken by most of the population and Hedy motive,

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.800
but talk piecing serves as the most common lingua franca and a lingua franca is

11
00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:39.870
certainly useful in Papa new Guinea,

12
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.110
because it's the most linguistically diverse country on the planet.

13
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.970
<v 1>Okay?</v>

14
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.480
<v 0>It's the most linguistically diverse country in the whole universe.</v>

15
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.640
Over 800 languages are spoken in Papa, new Guinea,

16
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.500
a country of just around 8 million people with so much linguistic diversity

17
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.310
talk piece in is frequently used for communication between people of different

18
00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:11.090
linguistic backgrounds. Look at the name of the language.

19
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.520
Talk peace in talk means language,

20
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.080
but it comes from the English word talk and also means talk speech, word,

21
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.700
message news, et cetera. The majority of talk in words, come from English,

22
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.210
but are used with different meanings or with a wider range of meanings.

23
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.370
This word peacing comes from pigeon,

24
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.240
but probably developed from the English word business, not in TOK,

25
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.520
but rather in a Chinese language talk. has also sometimes being called TOK.

26
00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:39.740
Boy, boy comes from boy,

27
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.610
but actually refers to someone who was an indentured laborer, servant,

28
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.500
or slave of colonial Europeans because their bosses or masters referred to

29
00:01:48.501 --> 00:01:49.970
them as boy talk,

30
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.310
began as a pigeon language on the plantations of German Samoa between 1880 and

31
00:01:55.311 --> 00:01:56.360
1914.

32
00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.830
When laborers from new Guinea were brought over an English based Creole in a

33
00:02:00.831 --> 00:02:02.540
German territory. Why?

34
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.250
Well laborers from the Solomon Islands and from Vanuatu had already been working

35
00:02:07.251 --> 00:02:11.000
on plantations in the Queensland colony in present day Australia.

36
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.240
And they had already developed an English based pigeon language

37
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.890
in short, they needed a common language for work.

38
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.670
So they adopted a small English vocabulary and use the grammar of their

39
00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:26.420
Melanesian languages to connect the words together in this way.

40
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.870
A Melanesian English based pigeon language arose in Queensland.

41
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.430
Some of these pigeon speakers from Vanuatu and Solomon Islands later worked in

42
00:02:34.431 --> 00:02:38.510
German Samoa alongside the new Guinea and laborers using their pigeon as a

43
00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:39.344
lingua franca.

44
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.370
People from all of these places brought the pigeon language home with them,

45
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.110
where it became widely used as a lingua franca and became Creole lysed meaning

46
00:02:48.111 --> 00:02:52.520
that it became spoken as a native language by some and became used for all

47
00:02:52.521 --> 00:02:53.600
aspects of life.

48
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.890
Not only for the limited functions of the pigeon language till this day,

49
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.160
the forms of pigeon spoken in Papa, new Guinea.

50
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.790
<v 2>The Solomon Islands in Vanuatu are all quite similar though.</v>

51
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:07.270
They have definitely diverged into their own distinct varieties.

52
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.270
After pigeon languages become Creole languages.

53
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.880
They are technically no longer pigeon languages,

54
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.910
but they are still referred to as pigeon in all three countries.

55
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.970
Now let's examine top piece in and see what it's like vocabulary as

56
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:26.170
an English based Creole language talk piecing got most of its vocabulary from

57
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.220
English, but words of English origin are usually pronounced quite differently.

58
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.380
Following phonological rules inherited from Austronesian languages of Melanesia.

59
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.610
For example, brother is pronounced enough.

60
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.460
<v 3>In a before B PL shark</v>

61
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.750
suck, stand or stand up sun up

62
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.060
words.

63
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.690
<v 2>Origin are also generally used differently than they are in English.</v>

64
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.000
<v 3>For example, from.</v>

65
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.190
<v 2>The English word place in TOK,</v>

66
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.220
this means village or hometown area or.

67
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.560
<v 3>Region from the English.</v>

68
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.550
<v 2>Word devil means soul shadow reflection or image.</v>

69
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.380
<v 3>Plus two from.</v>

70
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.660
<v 2>English close to means close to,</v>

71
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.430
but also nearly or almost Chris months from the English word

72
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.040
Christmas. This means Christmas, but in talk,

73
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.630
your age is also measured in the number of Christmases you have been alive for.

74
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.210
For example, you got Hamas Christmas.

75
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.570
This means how old are you and me got 10 Christmas.

76
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.640
This means I'm 10 years old since talk PC and vocabulary stems

77
00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:37.560
from a small English vocabulary.

78
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.120
Oftentimes one simple word is used to cover a whole set of synonyms in English

79
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.280
or a category of items. For.

80
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.380
<v 3>Example, from English.</v>

81
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.000
<v 2>Got or have got this means to have, or to possess in TOK.</v>

82
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.380
There's just this one.

83
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.780
<v 3>Word clueless from English.</v>

84
00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.000
<v 2>Cloths. This means clothes, but also blouse or dress cross.</v>

85
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.080
This means angry or annoyed or cross in English.

86
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.610
Cross means mildly annoyed and many North Americans might be unfamiliar with

87
00:05:08.611 --> 00:05:09.990
that word, but in talk,

88
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.620
it's the common word for all degrees of anger or annoyance

89
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.280
From English too much. This means very, or very much or greatly or too.

90
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.113
<v 3>Much.</v>

91
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.790
<v 2>And some words have expanded beyond synonyms to cover a wider range of meanings.</v>

92
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.710
Stop from English. Stop. This means to be located somewhere,

93
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.510
to remain, to stay,

94
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.530
to rest or to be in progress with this word,

95
00:05:37.531 --> 00:05:40.650
it might be a bit harder to wrap your head around. It's different meanings.

96
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.700
If you stop somewhere, then you are there at that place. You are remaining.

97
00:05:44.701 --> 00:05:48.240
There you are staying there. You are situated there. The meaning of,

98
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.380
to be in progress stems from the meaning of remaining because the action is

99
00:05:52.381 --> 00:05:53.670
remaining in progress.

100
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.880
<v 3>For example, Penn belong me stop long.</v>

101
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.550
<v 2>This means,</v>

102
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.230
whereas my pen pen of me is located at what place

103
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.790
normal talk piece in vocabulary comes from English.

104
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.320
Some words come from German since Samoa was under German control and parts of

105
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:15.530
new Guinea were under German control. When new Guineans returned,

106
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.070
this means to remove or to get rid of this comes from German house,

107
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.990
meaning out this means rubber and comes from the German word,

108
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:28.543
gummy.

109
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.230
<v 3>Musky. This.</v>

110
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.710
<v 2>Means it doesn't matter and comes from the German McNeese,</v>

111
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.300
which means the same thing.

112
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.250
Some vocabulary comes from Malaysia because of contact with Bahasa Indonesia on

113
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:45.110
the Island of new Guinea and contact with regional Molay languages. So soup,

114
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.260
meaning milk. This comes from the Malaysian word, Susu.

115
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.900
Some words also come from Portuguese because of early Portuguese contact with

116
00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:57.590
Melanesia as early as the 16th century. For example,

117
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.230
this means to know, to understand, to know how to, to be able to,

118
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.700
to be cognizant with,

119
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.870
or to be accustomed to this comes from Portuguese Saba,

120
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.810
which means to know Nini,

121
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:17.000
which means child or baby comes from Portuguese pecorino, which means little.

122
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.190
And there are also words from many Austronesian languages grammar.

123
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.790
While the vocabulary of talk PC PCN mainly comes from English.

124
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:30.020
The grammar largely reflects the Austronesian languages spoken by early pigeon

125
00:07:30.021 --> 00:07:33.710
speakers on the plantations. Let's look at a few examples here and later,

126
00:07:33.711 --> 00:07:37.700
we'll see more grammatical features in context, the predicate marker.

127
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.300
All third-person sentences contain a predicate marker E.

128
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.750
<v 3>Plus [inaudible].</v>

129
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.690
<v 2>Village. Doesn't have any water word for word.</v>

130
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.770
This sentence is village predicate, marker. No, have water.

131
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.130
The word he tells us that what comes next is the predicate.

132
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.390
The part of the sentence,

133
00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:59.200
telling us something about the subject and normally contains a verb in the

134
00:07:59.201 --> 00:08:01.540
language with a simple vocabulary and grammar.

135
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.600
It would be easy to hear the predicate as part of the subject.

136
00:08:04.601 --> 00:08:07.420
If there were no predicate marker place,

137
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.920
no gut water could be understood as the village that doesn't have any water,

138
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.130
which would leave the listener waiting for a predicate to follow.

139
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.060
Because that whole phrase sounds like the subject next,

140
00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:23.830
the trends of the verb. Marker. IM when verbs are transitive. In other words,

141
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.100
when they are followed by an object, the suffix IM is attached.

142
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.310
<v 3>Me like in two months, BIA.</v>

143
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.380
<v 2>It means I really like beer.</v>

144
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:37.180
I like really beer like him consists of like from

145
00:08:37.181 --> 00:08:39.820
English, like with the trends that have suffix him.

146
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:43.660
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

147
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.870
<v 2>This means yesterday, I saw you on the street yesterday.</v>

148
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:51.700
I see you on street. Looking consists of look from English.

149
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:54.820
Look with the transit of suffix in the sentence.

150
00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:59.340
Also contains an interesting word long, which brings me to the next point.

151
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.480
Prepositions talk basically has two main prepositions.

152
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.570
One of them is long, which comes from English along.

153
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.670
It's used to cover a wide range of English prepositions in by on with,

154
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.610
from two and at have a look at this exam.

155
00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.830
<v 3>All [inaudible] Monday longly.</v>

156
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.990
<v 2>This means they went by road on Monday to lay they preposition marker</v>

157
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:28.730
go by road on Monday to lay that's the name of a

158
00:09:28.731 --> 00:09:31.700
city. The word oil comes from English all,

159
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.760
but one of its uses is the third person, plural pronoun.

160
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:39.710
The other main preposition is belong, which comes from English belong.

161
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:44.750
It covers the meanings of, and for, and is often used to indicate possession.

162
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:45.913
For example.

163
00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:49.970
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

164
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:53.300
<v 2>This is my brother's car. This it predicate marker.</v>

165
00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:57.350
Car of brother of me next,

166
00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:59.060
the adjective marker pillar.

167
00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:03.020
The suffix pillar is normally added to single syllable adjectives when they

168
00:10:03.021 --> 00:10:05.980
appear before nouns. So a big tree is big.

169
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:11.150
Bella DUI big comes from English big and then the adjective suffix is attached

170
00:10:11.151 --> 00:10:15.920
to it. D Y is a word from one of TOK PCNs Austronesian substratum languages.

171
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:20.000
It's also worth pointing out that this phrase has no indefinite article talk.

172
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.660
PCN has no definite article and no indefinite article. In other words,

173
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:27.740
no equivalent of the or, but for clarity, one pillar,

174
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.380
meaning one can be used. So this phrase could.

175
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.020
<v 3>Be one pillar, big pillar.</v>

176
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.770
<v 2>One big tree.</v>

177
00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:38.420
Notice that one pillar comes from the English word one with the adjective suffix

178
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:42.410
attached to it. Okay. We've seen some of its key features.

179
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:46.250
So now let's look at a couple more top PC in sentences and break them down.

180
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:51.110
<v 3>Suppose me, plan. No, got enough money long by him.</v>

181
00:10:51.111 --> 00:10:54.950
House me Pella can walk him house the soul.

182
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.860
<v 2>This means if we don't have enough money to buy a house,</v>

183
00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.110
we can just build a house word for word it's.

184
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:03.830
If we no have enough money to buy house,

185
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:08.780
we can build house just suppose comes from English suppose

186
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:12.560
and is used to mean if me Pella comes from English, me,

187
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:14.420
which on its own would mean. I,

188
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:19.340
but the suffix pillar indicates that it's the plural form we belong is

189
00:11:19.341 --> 00:11:21.410
used here. To mean for, by him,

190
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.140
comes from English by and has the transitive verb.

191
00:11:24.141 --> 00:11:28.070
Suffix Wakim comes from English work, but means to make,

192
00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:32.870
build or repair tussle means just, or only, and comes from English.

193
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.600
That's all. And one more example.

194
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:39.080
<v 3>And me being sparked, no go through long sing sing.</v>

195
00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:43.940
<v 2>He got really drunk at the party, or she got really drunk at the party.</v>

196
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:48.860
He or she predicate marker past tense marker. Be drunk badly.

197
00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:52.580
Really at party M comes from English, him,

198
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:57.310
but as for both male and female and for subjects and objects in TOK piece in

199
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:02.230
bin comes from English bean and is used as an aspect marker to show completion

200
00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:05.680
of an action effectively indicating past tense in this sentence,

201
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.520
the spark comes from English spark and means to be drunk.

202
00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.070
No good comes from English. No good.

203
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.990
True comes from English true and is used as an adjective or as an adverb,

204
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:21.100
like truly or really long refers to the location of the action.

205
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:25.600
And syncing is a re-do application of the English word sing and is used to mean

206
00:12:25.601 --> 00:12:26.860
sing or song,

207
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:31.330
but also for a ceremony involving dancing and singing or for a party.

208
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.480
Let's think about being again for a minute talk,

209
00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.000
PCN verbs are basically not conjugated.

210
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.240
And the verb form is the same for all persons and numbers.

211
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:44.710
And times to indicate time, you can use a time word like us day,

212
00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:47.320
meaning yesterday to Maura, et cetera.

213
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:51.070
Or you can use an auxiliary verb that shows aspect like bean,

214
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.420
which shows completion.

215
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:57.760
Another option is to place penis from English finish after the verb for

216
00:12:57.761 --> 00:13:01.720
the future you can use, like, which has the sense of is about to,

217
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.410
for things a little farther in the future. You can use the word, buy or buy.

218
00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:08.680
And by for example, by me, come back,

219
00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:13.240
I shall return by and bind by come from the old fashioned English

220
00:13:13.241 --> 00:13:16.540
expression by in, by meaning after a short time,

221
00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:21.700
these words indicating an action's relation to time are not normally necessary.

222
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.300
If the time is clear from the context and the adverbs of the sentence.

223
00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:30.270
<v 0>Hopefully this video and the language samples within it have given you a sense</v>

224
00:13:30.271 --> 00:13:34.500
of what top piece in is like the English roots of much of its vocabulary are

225
00:13:34.501 --> 00:13:38.430
obvious, but it's also quite obvious that talk is not English.

226
00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.990
It's grammar is very different and even it's English based vocabulary is used

227
00:13:42.991 --> 00:13:46.380
quite differently. Talk be seen as a language in its own, right?

228
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:51.000
It's used in the parliament of Papa, new Guinea in TV and radio broadcasts.

229
00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.840
And it's used every day as a lingua franca throughout the country, though,

230
00:13:54.841 --> 00:13:58.560
there are books written in talk piece in it's currently not used much as a

231
00:13:58.561 --> 00:13:59.820
literary language though.

232
00:13:59.821 --> 00:14:03.060
Some people think that it can and should fulfill that role as well.

233
00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:07.350
But with English also being an official language and the language of schooling,

234
00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.430
other people think that English alone should remain the formal and literary

235
00:14:11.431 --> 00:14:12.030
language.

236
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:16.050
<v 2>The question of the day to native speakers of talk PCN for some people,</v>

237
00:14:16.051 --> 00:14:20.280
it's hard to imagine how talk PCNs vocabulary is sufficient for all parts of

238
00:14:20.281 --> 00:14:24.270
life. Do you find that talk is sufficient to say everything you want to say,

239
00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:27.180
are there times when it's not? And for other people,

240
00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:29.190
if you want to hear some more talk PCN,

241
00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:33.300
I will put a link to a talk PC in news broadcast in the description below,

242
00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.630
listen to that clip and let us know in the comments, what you think.

243
00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:39.630
Can you understand any of it? Does it sound like English.

244
00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.400
<v 0>If you enjoyed this video,</v>

245
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:45.090
be sure to check out Lang focus on the various social media platforms like

246
00:14:45.091 --> 00:14:48.660
Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter. And once again,

247
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.920
I want to say a special thanks to all of my supporters,

248
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.230
especially these ones right here on the screen.

249
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:57.590
There might talk to your Patrion supporters, many extra special,

250
00:14:57.591 --> 00:15:02.330
thanks to them and to everyone. Thank you for watching and have a nice day.
