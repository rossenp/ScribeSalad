00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.890
<v 0>Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Lang focus channel. And my name is Paul.</v>

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:05.670
Today.

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.620
I'm going to focus on the influence of the Arabic language on modern Hebrew.

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.910
If you pay too much attention to politics and conflict than you might think that

5
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:18.990
Hebrew speakers and Arabic speakers completely isolate themselves from each

6
00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:22.440
other. And that there's no way that Hebrew speakers would let their language be

7
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:25.830
influenced by Arabic. But this is definitely not the case.

8
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.270
There has actually always been extensive contact between Hebrew and Arabic in

9
00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:33.300
the Holy land. And Arabic has left its Mark on Hebrew.

10
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.710
Arabic influence on Hebrew actually goes back much earlier than the modern

11
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:42.090
Hebrew era. During the height of Islamic civilization in the middle ages,

12
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.420
Jewish scholars translated many Arabic writings into Hebrew,

13
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.620
but there were many new scientific and philosophical concepts that couldn't be

14
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:52.140
expressed using Hebrews existing vocabulary.

15
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.880
New Hebrew words were created using related roots and word patterns from Arabic

16
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.450
that were also lone translations, creating Hebrew compound words,

17
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:04.110
expressions and phrases based on how they were constructed in the original

18
00:01:04.111 --> 00:01:04.830
Arabic.

19
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.610
Many of these borrowings and loan translations are no longer used in modern

20
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:09.870
Hebrew, but some are.

21
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.460
<v 1>Like [inaudible] meaning date from Arabic,</v>

22
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.860
meaning history or date, the medical term, meaning nerve.

23
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.330
This comes from Arabic.

24
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.250
<v 0>This pair of words,</v>

25
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.150
we can see a sound change that took place in the development of modern Hebrew.

26
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.260
In Arabic.

27
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.490
The letter [inaudible] represents a pharyngeal sound that is articulated at the

28
00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:35.390
back of the throat eyes. This sound used to be pronounced in Hebrew,

29
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.400
but in modern Hebrew, it has disappeared.

30
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.850
So I end as pronounced as a simple glottal stop or as silent.

31
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.800
<v 1>Nimesh,</v>

32
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.480
meaning freckle from Arabic Nimesh also meaning

33
00:01:47.481 --> 00:01:51.360
horizon from Arabic here, we can see another.

34
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.560
<v 0>Frenetic change that took place in modern Hebrew in Arabic.</v>

35
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.210
The letter off represents a voiceless uvular stop sound like

36
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.500
KA, but pronounced at the back of the throat in modern Hebrew,

37
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.100
the equivalent letter COF is pronounced like a simple sound.

38
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.410
<v 1>[Inaudible] meaning center from Arabic Marquez.</v>

39
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.760
[inaudible] meaning geometry from Arabic and DISA.

40
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.900
This word now takes on the meaning of engineering in both languages,

41
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.380
but shoot, meaning simple or plain.

42
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.870
This is a lone translation of Arabic here. We see another.

43
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.260
<v 0>Phonetic change in modern Hebrew. The word in Arabic has the letter thaw,</v>

44
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.090
which represents an emphatic T sound call the Hebrew equivalent Tet

45
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.590
used to be pronounced this way,

46
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.860
but is now pronounced as a simple non-empathetic T sound.

47
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.390
<v 1>The CA meaning minute sneer,</v>

48
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.740
meaning second in reference to time also came from Arabic during this time

49
00:02:51.741 --> 00:02:56.630
period, specifically from the words ducky. Okay. And Sonya, and once again.

50
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.730
<v 0>And there's a difference here and pronunciation between the letter off and</v>

51
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:04.390
Hebrew COF hundreds of years later in the 19th century,

52
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.800
Jewish linguists were dedicating themselves to the revival of Hebrew as a spoken

53
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:13.420
native language Eliezer Benyehudah often referred to as the father of modern

54
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:18.130
Hebrew looked to modern standard Arabic as a source of roots and vocabulary that

55
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:21.460
could serve as a model for an expanded modern Hebrew vocabulary.

56
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.370
He suggested to the committee of the Hebrew language,

57
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:27.730
that in order to supplement the deficiencies of the Hebrew language,

58
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.140
the committee coins words,

59
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.280
according to the rules of grammar and linguistic analogy from Semitic roots,

60
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.320
especially from Arabic roots, rather than simply borrowing Arabic words,

61
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.430
he encouraged the construction of new Hebrew words that resembled Arabic ones.

62
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.460
For example, the Hebrew verb, gosh,

63
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.910
meaning to plow was based on the Arabic word. How to,

64
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.030
I should point out that when I introduce verbs,

65
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.010
they are given in their dictionary form.

66
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.920
The third person masculine singular past tense form.

67
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.970
This is a common way to present submitted verbs because it clearly shows the

68
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.440
continent. Usually three continents that make up the root of the verb here.

69
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:09.370
We see another difference in the pronunciation of modern Hebrew in Arabic.

70
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.260
The letter ha is pronounced as a guttural H sound ha in Hebrew,

71
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.320
the equivalent letter cat used to be pronounced this way,

72
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.460
but it's now pronounced.

73
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.630
<v 1>The verb he give meaning to him.</v>

74
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.410
<v 0>Migrate is based on the Arabic verb. In this case,</v>

75
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.960
the verbs routes are used in different templates,

76
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.030
different morphological verb patterns,

77
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.190
but the three-letter roots are equivalent.

78
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.200
The differences that the Hebrew root has Gameau good while Arabic has jeam

79
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.060
Jew, except in Egypt, in Arabic where it's good like Hebrew.

80
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.130
<v 1>So Bo uh, kind of.</v>

81
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.730
<v 0>Cactus known as a prickly pear or Sabra in English.</v>

82
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.740
This comes from Arabic Saba,

83
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.330
but this word and a colloquial form of it [inaudible] are used to refer to

84
00:04:54.331 --> 00:04:58.710
native born Israeli Jews. It's a metaphor for the character of Israeli Jews,

85
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.580
tough and prickly on the outside, but soft and sweet on the inside.

86
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.270
The Arabic word has an emphatic S sound so,

87
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.190
but the letter representing this sound in modern Hebrew is now pronounced like a

88
00:05:11.191 --> 00:05:12.780
T followed by an S.

89
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.000
<v 1>A few more words.</v>

90
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.300
<v 0>That Benyehudah successfully coined include police me,</v>

91
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.910
meaning official from Arabic. Oh, that's.

92
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.190
<v 1>Me. [inaudible] meaning.</v>

93
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.140
<v 0>Serious from Arabic, uh, deve courteous or polite,</v>

94
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.910
which comes from the Arabic word, DB, meaning civil courteous or cultured.

95
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.130
And it also has the meaning of author,

96
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.170
which has probably its main meaning today.

97
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.080
<v 1>Do you belong maneuver.</v>

98
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.380
<v 0>Which comes from Arabic Tammany, an exercise or.</v>

99
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.930
<v 1>A drill. There were also loan.</v>

100
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.880
<v 0>Translations, for example, good moral.</v>

101
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:50.483
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

102
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.470
<v 0>In Arabic, in Hebrew, the person being addressed response bulky, Oh,</v>

103
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.780
meaning mourning of light. This is a lone translation of the Arabic response,

104
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.840
which also means morning of light.

105
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.120
Many new words were created from existing Hebrew roots using this derivational

106
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:11.480
suffix, ER, this was rare in biblical Hebrew,

107
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.410
but very common in Arabic and was used to create some new words in medieval

108
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:18.230
Hebrew. But this became very common in modern Hebrew,

109
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:21.830
based on the example of Arabic, for example, the word for parasol.

110
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.640
<v 1>Shim Shia from Arabic Shamsi.</v>

111
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.850
<v 0>Both come from the root word, meaning son in Hebrew.</v>

112
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.610
<v 1>Shamans and an Arabic shuns.</v>

113
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.250
<v 0>The word from municipality in.</v>

114
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.460
<v 1>Hebrew Yulia from Arabic. [inaudible].</v>

115
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.260
<v 0>The types of influences that I've mentioned so far were carefully planned and</v>

116
00:06:41.261 --> 00:06:45.820
implemented by elite influencers of the language and entered the formal standard

117
00:06:45.821 --> 00:06:47.140
variety of modern Hebrew.

118
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.890
But most of the Arabic influence entered casual vernacular Hebrew.

119
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.940
The two main sources of this influence were the Arabs of Palestine and the Ms.

120
00:06:54.941 --> 00:06:59.710
Rakeem Eastern Jews. As I mentioned before, Jews living in Arab lands,

121
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.600
spoke Judeo Arabic Jewish dialects of Arabic that were influenced by Hebrew

122
00:07:04.601 --> 00:07:06.160
and written in the Hebrew alphabet.

123
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.570
When most of these Jews moved to Israel in the 1950s and sixties,

124
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.950
they spoke forms of Judeo Arabic as their native languages and learned Hebrew as

125
00:07:14.951 --> 00:07:15.940
a second language.

126
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:20.620
These Ms Rakeem formed a majority of the Israeli population from much of its

127
00:07:20.621 --> 00:07:24.610
history. This naturally had an impact on modern spoken Israeli Hebrew,

128
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:26.890
particularly on its more colloquial form.

129
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.610
Some of this influence is mainly heard in Israel's peripheral talents,

130
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.540
which were originally settled by Ms. Rakeem. For example, I'm a Dube,

131
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:38.680
an Arabic word, literally meaning to be hit, but used with the meaning of,

132
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.630
to be crazy. Another exam.

133
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:43.630
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

134
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:47.740
<v 0>Actually comes from an Amazon verbal route. Good. She did it via Moroccan,</v>

135
00:07:47.741 --> 00:07:51.820
Arabic. This originally referred to crying or wailing at a funeral.

136
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.600
This word is now sometimes used casually to mean to complain.

137
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.050
But I understand that this verb is now archaic back in Morocco.

138
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.110
Other words are not limited to peripheral towns,

139
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:06.730
but are apart of Hebrew slang throughout Israel. For example, the word Shavani.

140
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.530
This is short for the Arabic phrase [inaudible] which means look at me,

141
00:08:11.531 --> 00:08:12.820
people in Hebrew,

142
00:08:12.821 --> 00:08:16.900
it means a show off for an attention seeker in the original Arabic word,

143
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:21.010
ni is the first person singular object suffix in Hebrew,

144
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.220
the verb and the object suffix together are all one noun.

145
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.830
And the suffix is normalized and doesn't change.

146
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.760
So you can say he's a chiffony or we are chiffony et cetera.

147
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:35.020
Another example, I'm a stool, meaning drunk or intoxicated.

148
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.770
This comes from the Arabic word mustard with the same meaning.

149
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.740
There's a buttock, meaning be careful.

150
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:46.150
This phrase comes straight from Arabic to Bilich in Hebrew.

151
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.330
It's actually used more assertively than just saying, be careful.

152
00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.640
Maybe it's more like you'd better watch out.

153
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:57.240
Other words have become pervasive mainstream in casual spoken Hebrew to the

154
00:08:57.241 --> 00:09:00.060
extent that some people don't realize they're Arabic though.

155
00:09:00.061 --> 00:09:03.840
It's often hard to know whether these came from Judeo Arabic or Palestinian

156
00:09:03.841 --> 00:09:08.670
Arabic, for example, meaning fun. This comes from the Arabic word,

157
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.280
KF, meaning pleasure or enjoyment.

158
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.630
[inaudible] this right here is a very common modern Hebrew expression,

159
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:20.100
Isla meaning awesome or great. This comes from the Arabic word,

160
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.980
meaning sweetest or most pleasant.

161
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:25.380
<v 1>Soboba meaning.</v>

162
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.300
<v 0>Cool from colloquial Arabic.</v>

163
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:31.080
So Baba with the literary meaning of romantic longing,

164
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.640
but in Palestinian Arabic,

165
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.700
it also has the colloquial meaning of great or excellent,

166
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.500
which is the source of the Hebrew term.

167
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.370
But I've heard that it stopped being used much colloquially after Hebrew

168
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:43.380
speakers adopted it as Soboba.

169
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:45.510
<v 1>Absolute.</v>

170
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:49.830
<v 0>Meaning satisfied from the Arabic word, meaning happy you are well.</v>

171
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:52.543
<v 1>For DECA.</v>

172
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.300
<v 0>Embarrassment or full paw. This comes from the Arabic word,</v>

173
00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.020
meaning scandal, shame, or disgrace.

174
00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:03.343
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

175
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:07.850
<v 0>Arabic. This expression means as you like it, or as you wish Allah Catholic,</v>

176
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:12.290
but Hebrew adopted its colloquial. Meaning of great or awesome bus,

177
00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.540
meaning bummer or disappointment.

178
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:18.020
This comes from the Arabic word for frustration or disappointment.

179
00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:22.550
<v 1>[Inaudible] us.</v>

180
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:27.860
<v 0>Commonly hear this word in its plural form. This comes from the Arabic word.</v>

181
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:29.630
Ottis meaning pimp,

182
00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:34.490
but in Hebrew it's used to refer to how should I say poorly mannered,

183
00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.270
low class men in English. It would be something like, well,

184
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:43.310
but some people don't approve of this word because it's been used to stereotype

185
00:10:43.311 --> 00:10:44.810
men of Ms. Rocky background.

186
00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:49.310
Some of these pervasive mainstream words are such well known Arabic words that

187
00:10:49.311 --> 00:10:52.400
I'm sure Hebrew speakers consciously use them as lone words.

188
00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.080
There's the ubiquitous word,

189
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:58.400
yellow Hebrew speaking Israelis use this frequently in exactly the same way that

190
00:10:58.401 --> 00:11:03.350
Arabic speakers do with the meaning of let's go or come on or hurry up.

191
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.160
Israelis also often use this word casually to say by,

192
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.130
which is another way the words used in Palestinian Arabic.

193
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.440
And at the end of a phone call, you may hear,

194
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.160
or sometimes just yellow in modern Hebrew,

195
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:20.300
doubled consonants are not really pronounced as doubled. So in the Arabic word,

196
00:11:20.301 --> 00:11:24.260
you can hear a long L sound, but not really in Hebrew.

197
00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.630
<v 1>Yellow. How did all of these.</v>

198
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.790
<v 0>Phonetic changes take place in modern Hebrew?</v>

199
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:32.690
Modern Hebrew pronunciation is based on Sephardic pronunciation,

200
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.270
which was more similar to Arabic pronunciation,

201
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:39.500
but because most of the early Zionists who moved to Palestine in the 19th

202
00:11:39.501 --> 00:11:43.430
century and early 20th century were from Europe and spoke languages like

203
00:11:43.431 --> 00:11:44.990
Yiddish, Russian and German.

204
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.710
They naturally found some of the characteristically submitted continents,

205
00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:53.270
difficult to pronounce. In essence, they learned Hebrew with European accents,

206
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.320
which became the basis of modern Israeli pronunciation.

207
00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.930
If most of the early Zionists had been Miserables,

208
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.650
modern Hebrew today might have been pronounced more like Arabic,

209
00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:05.310
well from Arabic. Well,

210
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:10.500
meaning by God where I swear God and also really to show surprise

211
00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:13.260
in Hebrew it's used in that way to show surprise,

212
00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.750
like really no way or wow.

213
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.560
It's also sometimes used when you're listening to someone speak to show that

214
00:12:19.561 --> 00:12:23.430
you're listening the way an English speaker might say, yeah, right. [inaudible]

215
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.420
et cetera. Right. And Walla is also a popular Israeli news site.

216
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:32.130
Some Arabic speakers might be surprised to know that Hebrew speakers even use

217
00:12:32.131 --> 00:12:36.780
the greeting from Arabic as a casual alternative to

218
00:12:36.781 --> 00:12:41.010
Shalom. Then there's Habibi from Arabic heavy,

219
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:45.900
meaning my love for my buddy. And then there's much as noon from Arabic.

220
00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:47.573
Meaning crazy.

221
00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:51.570
Notice that the Hebrew letter Gimel can be modified with an apostrophe to

222
00:12:51.571 --> 00:12:54.060
represent the sound jus rather than good.

223
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.820
This is common in loan words from various languages.

224
00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:01.290
Another one that some people might find surprising is the use of Jani from

225
00:13:01.291 --> 00:13:04.620
Arabic in Arabic. It means it means.

226
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:09.180
And it's used to explain what you mean by adding information or phrasing like

227
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:11.550
that is in other words or meaning.

228
00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:16.290
There are also Arabic words that are used in Hebrew as a consequence of its

229
00:13:16.291 --> 00:13:17.550
middle Eastern environment.

230
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.170
There's the word [inaudible], which comes from Arabic.

231
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:25.560
I'm seeing I'm seeing is a heat wave caused by hot winds coming from the desert,

232
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:29.610
which can cause spring or fall temperatures to rise by 10 degrees or more.

233
00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:32.880
The word hum scene literally means 50 in Arabic.

234
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:37.320
This is used as the word for hot winds because of the exaggerated idea that they

235
00:13:37.321 --> 00:13:38.580
last for 50 days,

236
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.930
the Arabic word for 50 come seen is the source of the Hebrew word.

237
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:43.853
But in Arabic,

238
00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:48.630
the plural form Hamas scene is normally used or a related form. Come on.

239
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:53.190
Any other words include foods like the ever-present falafel

240
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:58.980
and hummus hummus foods native to the Lavant region and others like

241
00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.150
[inaudible] which Ms. Rocky immigrants brought from North Africa.

242
00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.630
I guess you could argue that these words are simply the names of foods and

243
00:14:06.631 --> 00:14:09.210
aren't really a true part of the language, but believe me,

244
00:14:09.211 --> 00:14:10.920
you hear the names of these foods. A lot,

245
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:15.120
the vast majority of modern Hebrew vocabulary is Hebrew,

246
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:19.470
whether it was taken from earlier forms of Hebrew or coined from existing Hebrew

247
00:14:19.471 --> 00:14:23.970
roots, but Arabic has definitely left its Mark on Hebrew supplying around

248
00:14:23.971 --> 00:14:28.860
27% of the loan words in the language and serving as a major source

249
00:14:28.861 --> 00:14:32.160
of slang for modern Hebrew in any language slang,

250
00:14:32.161 --> 00:14:36.630
usually derives first from the innovative speech of the lower socioeconomic

251
00:14:36.631 --> 00:14:38.940
classes and then spreads to the mainstream.

252
00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.670
And this has definitely been the case with Hebrew,

253
00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:45.300
with slang being borrowed from the speech of Ms. Rocky Israelis,

254
00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.930
as well as Arabs in Israel and the Palestinian Territories.

255
00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:52.130
The question of the day for speakers of modern Hebrew,

256
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.950
what words of Arabic origin do you commonly use?

257
00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.880
Can you think of any more that weren't included in the video and other people,

258
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:00.680
are you surprised to hear that Arabic,

259
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.830
lone words and slang are so commonly used in modern Hebrew,

260
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.580
leave your answers in the comments down below. If you enjoyed this video,

261
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:11.270
then be sure to check out Lang focus on the various social media platforms like

262
00:15:11.271 --> 00:15:14.270
YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. And as always,

263
00:15:14.271 --> 00:15:17.360
I want to say a special thanks to all of my Patrion supporters,

264
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.670
especially my top tier Patrion supporters,

265
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.650
whose names you see right here on the screen,

266
00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.530
many special thanks to them and to everyone.

267
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.110
Thank you for watching and have a nice day.

268
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:27.490
<v 2>Yay.</v>
