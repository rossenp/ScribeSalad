00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.310
<v 0>Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Lang focus channel. And my name is Paul. Today.</v>

2
00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:09.120
We're going to look at the differences between two languages that many people

3
00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:12.600
mistakenly think are the same Russian and Ukrainian.

4
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.520
The misconception that Russian and Ukrainian are the same might STEM from the

5
00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:20.160
fact that Russian is widely spoken in Ukraine.

6
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.280
The numbers differ depending on the survey, but according to one, 2015 survey,

7
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.120
60% of Ukrainians consider Ukrainian their native language.

8
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.330
15% consider Russian to be their native language.

9
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.660
And 22% consider both to be their native languages.

10
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.940
These numbers do not include Crimea,

11
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.320
which has been annexed by Russia or parts of the Eastern provinces of Donetsk

12
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.470
and Luhansk, which are not currently under Ukrainian control.

13
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.380
Those areas have a Russian speaking majority.

14
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.640
It's also worth noting that most Ukrainian speakers can also speak Russian.

15
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.560
Even if it's as a second language,

16
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.600
some people may hear you and speaking Russian and think to themselves, wow,

17
00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:01.640
Ukrainian is so similar to Russian,

18
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.250
but what they should say to themselves is wow.

19
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.060
Russian is so similar to Russian on top of that,

20
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.410
some people use a mixture of Ukrainian and Russian called pseudogenes and they

21
00:01:12.411 --> 00:01:16.040
may not be consciously aware of which elements are Ukrainian and which are

22
00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:20.270
Russian. This code mixing may also blur the lines between Ukrainian and Russian.

23
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.230
However,

24
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.520
despite the sometimes unclear delineation between the two languages standard,

25
00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:28.280
Russian and standard Ukrainian are clearly distinct.

26
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.940
And the vernacular speech of most people is also clearly distinct.

27
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.600
Both languages developed from the old East Slavic language,

28
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.620
which comprised a set of mutually intelligible dialects spoken within the

29
00:01:39.621 --> 00:01:43.880
Federation of reus, which later came to be referred to as key roofs.

30
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.020
These old East Slavic speakers are thought of as the ancestors of today's

31
00:01:48.021 --> 00:01:52.130
Russians Ukrainians. And Belarusians when Kevin reus fell,

32
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.660
the Slavic tribes were divided into two separate States and the oldest Slavic

33
00:01:56.661 --> 00:02:00.260
dialects in those separate States began to grow apart from each other and

34
00:02:00.261 --> 00:02:01.820
undergo different influences.

35
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.740
Bribes to the East came under the rule of the grand Duchy of Moscow and their

36
00:02:06.741 --> 00:02:09.860
dialects evolved into Russian standard Russian,

37
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.270
which is dominant today developed with more influence from old church Slavonic,

38
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.440
the old Slavic literary language, which differed from vernacular dialects.

39
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.600
Also under Peter, the great who aimed to turn Russia into a major Western power,

40
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.740
Russian adopted a significant amount of vocabulary from French and other

41
00:02:27.741 --> 00:02:32.420
European languages tribes. The West came under the grand Duchy of Lithuania,

42
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.250
and then the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth standard cranium was based on spoken

43
00:02:37.251 --> 00:02:37.910
vernaculars,

44
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.380
specifically the Southeastern dialects and lacks much of the old church Slavonic

45
00:02:42.381 --> 00:02:47.090
influence that Russian has Ukrainian also underwent a lot of Polish

46
00:02:47.091 --> 00:02:51.770
influence due to geographic proximity and Polish political control with Polish

47
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.810
being a lingua franca for a period of time.

48
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.140
This is especially true in Western Ukrainian dialects.

49
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.060
Now let's cut to the chase and start looking at the languages themselves

50
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.170
vocabulary,

51
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.490
Russian and Ukrainian share about 62% lexical similarity.

52
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.020
I personally found this number surprisingly low Ukrainian has a higher lexical

53
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:14.800
similarity with Polish Slovak and Belarusians than it does with Russian,

54
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.610
especially with Belarusians even among very basic words. There are lots of.

55
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.583
<v 1>Of differences.</v>

56
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.080
The word for paper in Ukrainian and in Russian [inaudible].

57
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.320
<v 0>I suspect the Ukrainian word was borrowed from Polish,</v>

58
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.850
which in turn borrowed it from Germany.

59
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.600
<v 1>The word for sugar Sahar.</v>

60
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.860
<v 0>Of these words are cognates that trace back to prodo, Indo European,</v>

61
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.560
the Russian word traces back to all these Slavic.

62
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.350
While the Ukrainian word was borrowed from Polish, which boy.

63
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.030
<v 1>I wrote it from German. The word for money dingy.</v>

64
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.480
<v 0>This Russian word is a borrowing from a Turkic language,</v>

65
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.210
but Russian also has a cognate of the Ukrainian.

66
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.310
<v 1>Word gushy, which refers.</v>

67
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.260
<v 0>To pennies or a small amount of money,</v>

68
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.630
and is also the name of some older types of coins.

69
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.060
<v 1>The word for morning rock ultra the word for bottle,</v>

70
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.680
this word traces back to Polish. And then the German [inaudible].

71
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.650
<v 0>This Russian word is also a lone word from Polish,</v>

72
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.630
which in turn got it from French in Polish Bouteflika is a more general word.

73
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.160
Wild flashcards is more.

74
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.560
<v 1>For hard liquor. Also.</v>

75
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.780
<v 0>The names of months are different in Russian.</v>

76
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.040
The names of months came from Latin via old church Slavonic in Ukrainian.

77
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.940
The names of the months are original vernacular Slavic words, for example,

78
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.340
January in Russian.

79
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:36.840
<v 1>And then Ukrainian,</v>

80
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.060
she changed and February [inaudible] and so on.

81
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.660
<v 0>With most languages, which are closely related.</v>

82
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.320
There are lots of false friends in Russian and Ukrainian words that appear to

83
00:04:49.321 --> 00:04:50.190
have the same meaning,

84
00:04:50.191 --> 00:04:54.990
but actually don't this Ukrainian word means time chess.

85
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.850
This Russian word means our.

86
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.370
<v 1>This means pumpkin out booths. And this means watermelon.</v>

87
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.790
This means Sunday Magella and this means week sorority.

88
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.800
<v 0>This means to scold in the imperfection of form so that each and this means to</v>

89
00:05:13.801 --> 00:05:15.180
boil in the perfective.

90
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.130
<v 1>Form sheet. This.</v>

91
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.220
<v 0>Word means world Savitt. This means light.</v>

92
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.520
This Russian word does have a secondary meaning of world,

93
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.780
but only in some fixed.

94
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.000
<v 1>Expressions like.</v>

95
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.750
<v 0>This means to scold light. And this word means to.</v>

96
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.880
<v 1>Bark, orthography.</v>

97
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.170
<v 0>And pronunciation, both languages use varieties of the Cyrillic alphabet,</v>

98
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.500
but there are a number of differences between the Russian variety and the

99
00:05:40.501 --> 00:05:44.250
Ukrainian variety. First Ukrainian has this letter,

100
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.170
which represents the sound good,

101
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.060
but Russian doesn't have this letter in Russian GU is represented by this letter

102
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.680
in Ukrainian. This letter is normally pronounced as next.

103
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.120
Ukrainian has this, which represents the sound eat,

104
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.760
but Russian doesn't have this letter in Russian.

105
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.810
This letter represents the sound eat. Ukrainian has this letter,

106
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.160
which represents the sound yet in Russian. This letter represents the similar.

107
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.260
<v 1>Sound yay. But in Ukrainian.</v>

108
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.650
<v 0>This letter represents the sound. And in Russian,</v>

109
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.700
that sound is represented by this letter, a letter which isn't used in.

110
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.980
<v 1>Ukrainian, Russian.</v>

111
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.370
<v 0>Has this letter, which represents the sound E a letter,</v>

112
00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:28.400
which Ukrainian doesn't have instead in Ukrainian,

113
00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:31.730
this letter represents the equivalent sound. In addition to the sound,

114
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:37.460
for example, the words, meaning soap in Russian Manila and in Ukrainian.

115
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.310
<v 1>Ukrainian.</v>

116
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.770
<v 0>Has this letter to represent the sound eat,</v>

117
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.380
but Russian doesn't have this letter in Russian.

118
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.380
This sound is represented by a combination of two letters.

119
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.340
Russian has this letter to represent the sound you'll,

120
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.350
but Ukrainian doesn't use this letter.

121
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.990
Instead it uses a combination of two letters.

122
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.490
Russian has this special letter that doesn't represent a sound but indicates

123
00:07:01.491 --> 00:07:05.630
that the previous consonant is in its hard to consonant form in a context where

124
00:07:05.631 --> 00:07:09.920
you would expect the soft consonant form Ukrainian doesn't use this letter,

125
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.710
but instead uses an apostrophe after the continent.

126
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.970
So in Russian it's written like this object while in Ukrainian,

127
00:07:16.971 --> 00:07:20.240
it's written like this grammar,

128
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.530
the concepts of grammar in Russian and Ukrainian are generally the same.

129
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.190
They both have three genders, masculine, feminine, and neuter.

130
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.300
They both have almost the same set of noun cases that apply to adjectives and

131
00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:36.560
pronouns as well. They share the same major verb, conjugations and so on,

132
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:41.030
but the exact word forms are often different or at least not entirely the same.

133
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.960
Let's look at the different case forms for the now meaning head in both

134
00:07:44.961 --> 00:07:45.680
languages.

135
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.180
These words are cognates in Russian Gullah and in Ukrainian,

136
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.690
these are both in the nominative singular form.

137
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.500
Notice that in the nominative singular, they are spelled exactly the same,

138
00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.580
but sound fairly different. The first consonant is one that I mentioned before,

139
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:05.960
which normally sounds like good in Russian, but in Ukrainian.

140
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:07.730
<v 1>In Russian, the.</v>

141
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.010
<v 0>Old vowel is frequently reduced to ah,</v>

142
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:14.360
or Schwab when unstressed well in Ukrainian, it tends to not be reduced.

143
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.340
Now looking at the case forms.

144
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.760
One thing to notice is that the case endings have some different vowels,

145
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:23.900
some are different letters representing equivalent sounds. For example,

146
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:28.640
the Russian genitive singular and the Ukrainian genitive, singular

147
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.630
others represent different sounds. For example,

148
00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:36.650
the Russian date of singular Gullah and the Ukrainian date of singular.

149
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.880
Another thing to notice is that while Ukrainian has a vocative case,

150
00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:41.930
Russian does not,

151
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:46.070
the vocative form is the form you use when you are addressing or calling someone

152
00:08:46.071 --> 00:08:49.910
or something. The old vocative form was lost from Russian,

153
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.960
except for a few specific words. For example, when addressing God,

154
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:59.460
it seems that it's being used less and less than spoken Ukrainian as well,

155
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:04.350
but it's still used by some. And as part of standard Ukrainian in Russian,

156
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.760
a new vocative form is apparently starting to develop in which the final vowel

157
00:09:08.761 --> 00:09:12.690
is dropped. Usually from names and familial words. For example,

158
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.760
mama becomes mum,

159
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.720
but whether or not it's a genuine vocative case form is debated.

160
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.910
Another common difference is that in Russian, the copula bleach,

161
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.150
the word meaning to be is not used in the present tense.

162
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:31.260
This is often true in Ukrainian too, which has a lot of dialectal variation,

163
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.520
but in formal standard speech and in Western dialects closer to Poland,

164
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.630
the copula is commonly used. For example, let's look at the sentences,

165
00:09:39.631 --> 00:09:42.150
meaning this is illegal in Russian.

166
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.000
At that music in Ukrainian,

167
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:49.440
it could be similar or it might have the copula like this

168
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.490
in Western Ukraine. It might be like, this

169
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:58.470
is similar to tall. Yes. In Polish.

170
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.570
Another difference is that you cranium has some additional verb conjugations

171
00:10:03.571 --> 00:10:06.150
that Russian doesn't have in Ukrainian.

172
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.210
There's an additional way to express the imperfection of future.

173
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.750
That Russian doesn't have take the sentence, meaning they will be eating,

174
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.920
or they will eat in an imperfect of sense in Russian. I need Buddha.

175
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.610
And now when Ukrainian first with any equivalent structure

176
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:26.190
in both languages, there's the subject pronoun, the third person plural,

177
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.350
then the future conjugation of the verb,

178
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.830
meaning to be followed by the infinitive of the lexical verb,

179
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:36.180
the main verb that supplies the core meaning, but Ukrainian also has this form

180
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:42.540
rather than using the verb to be a suffix is attached to the infinitive

181
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.660
followed by the same future inflection that appeared on the verb,

182
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:50.310
meaning to be this alternate conjugation is called the imperfection of synthetic

183
00:10:50.311 --> 00:10:51.144
future tense.

184
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:56.190
Ukrainian also has a PLU perfect conjugation that Russian doesn't have though.

185
00:10:56.191 --> 00:11:00.570
Not everyone uses it in Ukrainian anymore. For example, here's a sentence.

186
00:11:00.571 --> 00:11:04.080
Meaning I had been reading this book, but I forgot its content.

187
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.680
<v 2>Yeah, [inaudible].</v>

188
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.420
<v 0>The blue perfect is formed with the past tense perfective form of the lexical</v>

189
00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:15.530
verb followed by the past tense of the verb. Meaning to be in Russian,

190
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.850
the sentence would be, yes.

191
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:20.870
<v 2>[Inaudible] [inaudible].</v>

192
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:21.500
<v 0>In Russian.</v>

193
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.370
The past tense perfective form of the verb is used rather than a special blue

194
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:26.623
perfect form.

195
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:30.290
This might be a good time to stop for a moment and examine some other

196
00:11:30.291 --> 00:11:32.120
differences between these two sentences.

197
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.910
Before we saw that the words for this are different.

198
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.250
That was in the neuter nominative form.

199
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.760
Here they are both in the feminine accusative form. And again,

200
00:11:40.761 --> 00:11:44.060
they take on slightly different forms. Next notice the words,

201
00:11:44.061 --> 00:11:46.700
meaning book our cognate, but with different forms,

202
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.070
the Ukrainian word is in its diminutive form,

203
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.070
which is the everyday way to say book.

204
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.030
It can also be said with the same format in Russian,

205
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:58.090
but that would be more formal in Ukrainian in Russian.

206
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.880
There is also a diminutive form. Kishka,

207
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.410
it's less common than in Ukrainian and an even more informal word for book or

208
00:12:05.411 --> 00:12:09.610
something like a booklet. Both words are in the accusative singular form here.

209
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.970
Notice that the words for, but are different. However,

210
00:12:12.971 --> 00:12:16.180
it's worth noting that the primary meaning of the Ukrainian word is,

211
00:12:16.181 --> 00:12:19.930
and this word is a more common word for, but,

212
00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.180
and notice the cognate words,

213
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.720
meaning for God that takes somewhat different forms. Next,

214
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:29.500
these are the third person feminine, singular genitive, personal pronouns,

215
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:34.180
and these words are cognates. And finally we see the nouns, meaning content,

216
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.540
the Russian word [inaudible] consists of the verb,

217
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.320
meaning to contain plus Anya,

218
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:46.330
a suffix that forms abstract nouns from verbs. The Ukrainian word is a simple.

219
00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:48.580
Now that isn't composed of these two parts.

220
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.920
Another difference is that Russian at least formal Russian makes use of active

221
00:12:53.921 --> 00:12:58.870
participants to give extra information about a noun phrase while Ukrainian does

222
00:12:58.871 --> 00:13:00.730
not. For example, the phrases,

223
00:13:00.731 --> 00:13:03.760
meaning the woman's sitting on the chair first in Russian.

224
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:06.700
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

225
00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.670
<v 0>This phrase has an active participant, but in Ukrainian,</v>

226
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.550
this meaning would be expressed using a relative clause.

227
00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:17.650
[inaudible] this is like saying the woman that sits on the chair.

228
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:22.330
That's also how this meeting would be expressed in daily speech in Russian.

229
00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:25.560
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

230
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.790
<v 0>In the Russian sentence, the relative pronoun is cut throat, but in Ukrainian,</v>

231
00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:34.230
there are several possibilities, which is cognate with the Russian word.

232
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:36.323
<v 2>Or.</v>

233
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:41.250
<v 0>As in the sentence above and as a side note, look at the different forms.</v>

234
00:13:41.251 --> 00:13:45.630
The word for woman takes in Russian it's Jane Sheena, while in Ukrainian,

235
00:13:45.631 --> 00:13:49.530
it's the preposition meaning on is the same,

236
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.690
except for slightly different vowel quality.

237
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.060
And the words for chair are clearly related,

238
00:13:54.061 --> 00:13:58.260
but take on different forms in the most basic form, the nominative singular,

239
00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:02.010
the Russian word is stool and the Ukrainian word is

240
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.730
here. The are in the locomotive case though,

241
00:14:05.731 --> 00:14:08.940
for Russian it's often referred to as the propositional case.

242
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:14.670
Now let's look at one final sentence and see what we find these sentences mean.

243
00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:17.820
I can't go because I'll be working tomorrow in Russian.

244
00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.140
<v 2>[Inaudible] [inaudible].</v>

245
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:26.730
<v 0>And then Ukrainian [inaudible] Word for word,</v>

246
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.550
both sentences. Are I negative?

247
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:34.440
Can go because tomorrow I will be to work.

248
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:36.840
Notice that the first two words,

249
00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:41.700
meaning I then the negative are basically the same. Next. The words meaning can,

250
00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:44.910
are cognitive, but have grown apart and are now pronounced differently.

251
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:49.290
Notably the second consonant next, the verbs meaning go are cognates.

252
00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.120
There are both perfective infinitive,

253
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.940
both verbs contain a perfective prefix attached to the imperfect verb.

254
00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:01.550
Next there's a compound conjunction meaning because in both languages and these

255
00:15:01.551 --> 00:15:02.660
parts are cognates,

256
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.770
but the Russian compound contains an extra element in Ukrainian.

257
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:10.790
A different conjunction book can also be used. Next.

258
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:14.390
The words for tomorrow are basically the same after that.

259
00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.100
We see the subject pronoun again,

260
00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:20.510
but it isn't necessary and can be dropped because the subject is clear from the

261
00:15:20.511 --> 00:15:24.920
conjugation of the verb. Both Russian and Ukrainian are pro drop languages.

262
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.480
Next, the imperfection of future tents is formed in the same way with the verb,

263
00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:33.110
meaning to be as the auxiliary verb in the future tense followed by the

264
00:15:33.111 --> 00:15:35.660
infinitive of the lexical verb, meaning to work,

265
00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.000
but the lexical verbs themselves are different.

266
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.970
The Ukrainian word was borrowed from Polish.

267
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.590
Now remember that Ukrainian has the alternate way of saying something in the

268
00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:48.410
imperfection of future. So this could also be,

269
00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:55.100
as I'm sure you can see Russian and Ukrainian are very closely related languages

270
00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:58.670
that share a lot of similarities, but they also have a lot of differences,

271
00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:02.570
some of the minor and some of the major, lots of different vocabulary,

272
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.230
different pronunciation and different word forms that have arisen over time.

273
00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:10.280
Make the two languages only partially mutually intelligible to people who don't

274
00:16:10.281 --> 00:16:12.260
have much exposure to the other language.

275
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:16.790
But since most Ukrainian speakers also speak Russian or have extensive exposure

276
00:16:16.791 --> 00:16:20.450
to it, asymmetric intelligibility is the norm. In other words,

277
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.990
Ukrainian speakers can often understand Russian while the Russian speaker

278
00:16:23.991 --> 00:16:28.220
doesn't understand Ukrainian, especially Russian speakers from outside Ukraine.

279
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.760
The question of the day for speakers of Russian and Ukrainian,

280
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:34.160
how similar do you think the two languages are?

281
00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:37.940
To what extent can you understand the other one and for other people,

282
00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:42.380
how similar to Russian and Ukrainian seemed to you, if you enjoyed this video,

283
00:16:42.381 --> 00:16:45.980
be sure to check out Lang focus on the various social media platforms like

284
00:16:45.981 --> 00:16:49.400
Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and as always,

285
00:16:49.401 --> 00:16:52.370
I want to give a very special thanks to my Patrion supporters,

286
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:56.060
especially my top tier Patrion supporters whose names are right here on the

00:16:56.061 --> 00:16:59.630
screen, many special thanks to them and to everyone.

288
00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.300
Thank you for watching and have a nice day.

289
00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:02.960
<v 1>Okay.</v>
