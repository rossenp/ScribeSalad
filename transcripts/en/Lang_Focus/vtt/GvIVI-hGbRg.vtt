00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.860
<v 0>Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Lang focus channel. And my name is Paul.</v>

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.160
Today. We're going to talk about the Caucasian languages.

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.790
The Caucasian languages are named after the Caucasus mountains,

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.270
which are situated between the black sea and the Caspian sea,

5
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.020
and more or less serve as a geographic border between Europe and Asia,

6
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.800
the Caucasian languages are spoken in and around the Caucasus mountains,

7
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.520
the Caucasian languages are actually not a language family.

8
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.300
They are a regional grouping of languages. And within that regional grouping,

9
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.100
there are several language families.

10
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.390
The families normally included within the regional grouping. Our Kartra Lillian,

11
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.060
which used to be referred to as South Caucasian,

12
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.030
Northwest Caucasian and Northeast Caucasian.

13
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.390
There are other language families present in the caucuses,

14
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.870
including Indo-European submitted Turkic and Mongolia,

15
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.400
but they're distributed over a wider area and have indigenous speakers outside

16
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:54.234
of the region.

17
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.350
These particular three language families are indigenous only to the caucuses,

18
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.050
which is what makes the members of this group of languages.

19
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.290
Carillion has around 5.2 million speakers,

20
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.180
mainly in Georgia around 4 million of them speak Georgian in Georgia, of course,

21
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.620
but also by a minority over the border in Turkey, as there by John and Russia.

22
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.190
The other cart really in languages are [inaudible] laws,

23
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.240
which has spoken mainly on the Southeast coast of the black sea in Turkey and

24
00:01:21.241 --> 00:01:22.074
spun.

25
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.490
This fun branched off from Carillion around 5,000 years ago.

26
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.080
And the other branch split into cart or Georgian and Zan around

27
00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:32.280
4,000 years ago,

28
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.960
then Zen began diverging into mean Greeley in at laws in the seventh century

29
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.410
when their speakers were separated into different territories. I mean,

30
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.180
brilliant in-laws are the closest to,

31
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.800
to in languages and have some degree of mutual intelligibility. However,

32
00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:51.120
it's worth noting that many or even most speakers have mean Grillion laws and

33
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.160
spawn the ones who live in Georgia that is also speak Georgian and Georgian has

34
00:01:56.161 --> 00:02:00.600
traditionally been the written language for all Vili and speakers. So of course,

35
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.860
those bilingual speakers can also understand Georgia Northeast Caucasian

36
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:09.420
languages are spoken by around 3.8 million people, mainly in dog Istan,

37
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.290
Chechnya, English Petia and parts of Northern Azerbaijan.

38
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.180
The most widely spoken languages include Czechian with 1.5 million speakers

39
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.020
of our,

40
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.760
with 1 million lesbian with around 800,000 and English with around

41
00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:28.140
500,000 Northwest Caucasian languages are spoken by around

42
00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:29.580
2.5 million people,

43
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.330
mainly in up Kazia the kebab Dino bell calorie and Republic,

44
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.400
the [inaudible] Republic,

45
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.180
and [inaudible] there are four or five main languages,

46
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.400
Cub guardian or Easter Cashin with around 1.6 million speakers OD the

47
00:02:44.401 --> 00:02:48.090
gay or West, sir Cashin with around half a million speakers.

48
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.230
Many of them in Turkey,

49
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.370
in the middle East at the cause with around 190,000 speakers.

50
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.710
And Abaza with around 50,000,

51
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.550
I should point out that the Circassia people also known as the ADI gay people

52
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.960
consider both the East and West branches to be the same language and refer to

53
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:09.220
all varieties as other gay. And they are mutually intelligible with each other.

54
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.870
There's also the extinct language, which was quite an intriguing language.

55
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.800
As we'll see later,

56
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.510
the Northwest and the Northeast Caucasian languages are thought by some

57
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:22.390
linguists to be branches of a single language family,

58
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.840
the North Caucasian languages, but this is still controversial.

59
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.770
[inaudible] is widely accepted to be unrelated to them yet,

60
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.980
despite the huge diversity within these three language families,

61
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.420
there are also numerous shared features due to mutual regional influence.

62
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.870
In other words, the Brock Boont effect common features,

63
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.900
all Caucasian languages are continental languages,

64
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.220
meaning that consonants are heard with more frequency than vowels in cartwheels.

65
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:52.330
And specifically, there are lots of big consonant clusters, for example,

66
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.030
skinny. This means they peel us. Of course the meaning is nonsensical,

67
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.980
but it's an example of how big the consonant clusters can potentially get the

68
00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:06.820
Caucasian languages are also known for their rich continent inventories.

69
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:07.600
In other words,

70
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.530
they have lots of distinct consonants the degree to which this is true,

71
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.710
depends on the language family and on the individual language.

72
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.670
The court really and languages have comparably few distinct consonants,

73
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.640
28 for Georgian and 30 for laws.

74
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.770
That's similar to the 28 of Arabic and the 36 of Russian note that I'm

75
00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:30.130
talking about. Consonant sounds not written consonant, symbols,

76
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.510
the Northwest and Northeast Caucasian languages have much larger inventories,

77
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.520
especially in Northwest Caucasian.

78
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.140
The now extinct Uzbek language had over 80 distinct consonants.

79
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.640
And sir Cashin has 50 to 60 consonants depending on the dialect.

80
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.630
That may sound impossible. How could there be so many consonants? Well,

81
00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:52.510
it's in large part due to secondary articulation.

82
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.480
If a consonant has secondary articulation,

83
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.990
that basically means that it's pronounced in two different places in the vocal

84
00:04:58.991 --> 00:05:02.470
tract at the same time, like two continents at the same time,

85
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.090
one primary continent,

86
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.170
and then one extra continent pronounced along with it that secondary

87
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:12.250
articulation might be palatalization with the tongue raised towards the hard

88
00:05:12.251 --> 00:05:13.060
palate,

89
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.010
liberalization articulation with the lips valorization the back of the

90
00:05:18.011 --> 00:05:22.690
tongue raises towards the vellum, globalization, the closure of the glottis.

91
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.680
And so on one type of continent with secondary articulation,

92
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.510
that's common to the Caucasian language.

93
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.230
Families is ejective consonants in any objective continent.

94
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.460
The glottis at the back of your throat is closed and the larynx is quickly

95
00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:39.100
raised, which raises the air pressure in the mouth.

96
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.820
This creates a popping sound. When the primary consonant is produced,

97
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.800
all of the languages have ejective stops. Let's hear some electives in Georgia.

98
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:53.160
<v 1>Uh, uh, sir, uh, uh, uh,</v>

99
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.010
an example word, meaning water in all of.

100
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.090
<v 0>The languages stops have at least a three way distinction between voiceless</v>

101
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.960
aspirated stops voiced stops and ejective stops.

102
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.073
<v 2>Uh.</v>

103
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.220
<v 0>Here's an example word in Chechen, meaning bridge,</v>

104
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.120
listen for the slight popping sound that accompanies that sound

105
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:23.200
sir Cashin in the Northwest Caucasian family has ejective fricatives as well for

106
00:06:23.201 --> 00:06:26.980
a total of at least 10 objectives, or even more, depending on the dialect.

107
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.450
<v 2>Pull, pull, pull, cheer,</v>

108
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:38.050
cheer, slow, and the word meaning black.

109
00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:44.170
<v 0>Another common feature is contrast between Vilar and uvular stops.</v>

110
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.790
For example, in Chechen.

111
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.630
<v 2>Good, cool con connect.</v>

112
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.730
<v 0>Agglutination. The word agglutination comes from the Latin word,</v>

113
00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.220
a gluten naughty meaning to glue together.

114
00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.540
That gives us an image of how words are formed in a gluten native languages.

115
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.160
Words are created by gluing together a linear sequence of morphemes with each

116
00:07:06.161 --> 00:07:09.970
morphine representing one piece of meaning that's slightly different from

117
00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:13.840
fusional languages in which those additional morphemes can contain multiple

118
00:07:13.841 --> 00:07:17.890
pieces of meaning. Here's an example from Chechen Mola.

119
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.220
This is a verb in the infinitive form, meaning to drink.

120
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.470
<v 2>The law. This means.</v>

121
00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:28.360
<v 0>To start drinking this suffix creates the inceptive form to change to</v>

122
00:07:28.361 --> 00:07:33.100
the past tense. We can first remove part of the ending and replace it with this.

123
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.710
<v 2>Mold delete. This means.</v>

124
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.230
<v 0>Started drinking in the recent past,</v>

125
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.350
but it's something the speaker has no direct knowledge of.

126
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:43.720
<v 2>Delete. This.</v>

127
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.280
<v 0>Means started drinking and I saw it happen with the suffix at all.</v>

128
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.930
The verb is in the witnessed past. The speaker witnessed the action happening.

129
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.320
This type of feature is called evidentiary city.

130
00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.740
All three families have a feature called evidentiary nutty,

131
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.970
which means that verbs are inflected to show whether the speaker has evidence of

132
00:08:03.971 --> 00:08:04.930
the action or not.

133
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.560
This feature entered carte Vivian through Turkic influence though,

134
00:08:08.561 --> 00:08:12.730
in the other families, it likely existed before contact with Turkic speakers,

135
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.160
especially in the Northwest Caucasian family,

136
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:21.400
Caucasian languages also generally display SOV word order though,

137
00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:24.790
this is not equally true for all families or languages. Georgian,

138
00:08:24.791 --> 00:08:26.500
for example has SOV,

139
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:31.120
but also SVO depending on what the focus of the sentence is with the focus

140
00:08:31.121 --> 00:08:34.150
coming before the verb ergots activity,

141
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.940
all three families display or negativity though,

142
00:08:36.941 --> 00:08:39.460
the cart really in language mean Grillion does not.

143
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:43.900
You may be wondering what the heck is [inaudible] sometimes I still ask myself

144
00:08:43.901 --> 00:08:44.830
that same question.

145
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.190
It's a feature that's quite rare among the languages of the world.

146
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.690
Some other ergots of languages include Basque, Kurdish, Hindi, and Tibetan,

147
00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.000
basically in an ergot of language, the,

148
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.790
of an intransitive verb and the direct object of a transitive verb are treated

149
00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:01.980
as the same. They are in the same case,

150
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.760
the absolute of case let's give an example in fake English.

151
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.650
We'll pretend English as ergotism. He sleeps him, loves she,

152
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.940
you can see that the object of this sentence is in the same case as the subject

153
00:09:14.941 --> 00:09:19.170
of this sentence. Why that's so weird. Think of it like this.

154
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:23.430
These two pronouns are in the same case because they both fully received the

155
00:09:23.431 --> 00:09:25.950
verbs action in an intransitive verb.

156
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.190
The subject undergoes the action in a transitive verb.

157
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.880
The object number goes to the action. So they are both in the same case.

158
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.230
The absolute of case,

159
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:38.190
the subject of the transitive verb is treated differently because it doesn't

160
00:09:38.191 --> 00:09:41.460
receive the action it's in the ergotamine case. Yeah,

161
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.910
but that's in fake English, right? Here's an example in Georgian,

162
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.940
meaning the student went student immune reader.

163
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.970
This sentence means the student wrote the letter.

164
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.160
<v 2>Student [inaudible].</v>

165
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.500
<v 0>So you can see that student in the first sentence is in the same case as letter</v>

166
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:02.640
in the second sentence student in the second sentence is in a different case.

167
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.180
Georgian has mixed or Cotivity with the feature,

168
00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:08.910
not appearing in all tenses or with all verbs,

169
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
but other Caucasian languages are more consistently ergotism

170
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:17.190
features shared by two of the three families. As I said before,

171
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:21.210
the Northeast Caucasian and Northwest Caucasian languages are thought by some

172
00:10:21.211 --> 00:10:25.710
linguists to be part of a single language family referred to as North Caucasian.

173
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:30.030
So they have some shared features that Kartra Lilian doesn't have, or does have,

174
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.200
but to a lesser degree,

175
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:34.770
I already mentioned that they have much larger consonant inventories,

176
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.820
then Carter Ilian, for example, they have laryngeal consonants.

177
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.540
These are consonants pronounced in your voice box at the back of your throat,

178
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:47.400
your pharynx or your blotters Northeast Caucasian has the most, for example,

179
00:10:47.401 --> 00:10:48.234
in Chechen.

180
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:53.810
<v 2>Oh, a couple of example, where it's.</v>

181
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.900
<v 0>Custom or habit and meaning swamp or Marsh</v>

182
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.580
and insert Cashen.

183
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.250
It's easier to hear these sounds in an actual word.

184
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.710
This means Bay or Gulf. The only laryngeal sounded Kartra.

185
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.350
Lillian is hut like the H sound in English.

186
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.290
They also have liberalized consonants,

187
00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.040
which means the consonants are produced with the lips rounded at the same time,

188
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.600
for example, in Circassia.

189
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.070
<v 2>Crew crew crew,</v>

190
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:35.780
and an example word.

191
00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:40.460
<v 0>They also exist in Chechen, but in Chechen, they are non phonemic.</v>

192
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:44.120
They are aliphatic, which means they're not perceived as separate continents,

193
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:46.850
merely as variations of an existing continent.

194
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.890
North Caucasian languages often use non finite verb forms,

195
00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:56.950
verb forms that don't any tents like participles in English, such as reading.

196
00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.730
These are normally used as modifiers instead of relative clauses,

197
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.940
Northwest Caucasian. And Kartra really,

198
00:12:03.941 --> 00:12:07.330
and also have some things in common that Northeast Caucasian doesn't have.

199
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.330
One major example is poly personal verbs.

200
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.320
Poli personal verbs can have inflections for more than one person in the

201
00:12:14.321 --> 00:12:18.430
sentence, including the subject direct object and indirect object.

202
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:23.290
Here's an example in Georgia. [inaudible] this means they will show us.

203
00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:27.670
This is the direct object marker. Meaning us. This is the pre verb,

204
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:31.660
which helps distinguish certain tenses. This is the root meaning show.

205
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:36.460
And this is the subject marker. Meaning they, and in sir Cashin.

206
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.030
Yes. Thus, this means I gave it to him or her.

207
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:43.390
This is the indirect object marker. Meaning him or her.

208
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:47.230
This is the subject marker. Meaning I, this is the root meaning.

209
00:12:47.231 --> 00:12:51.430
Give this indicates the predator that form. In other words, the past tense,

210
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:55.090
this indicates the verb. As in the affirmative here,

211
00:12:55.091 --> 00:12:58.690
the direct object is left out because it's clear from the context,

212
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.330
but sentences that include it are also possible.

213
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:06.250
The genetic links of the Caucasian languages to other language families are

214
00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:09.310
completely unknown, which has led to some interesting theories.

215
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:13.030
Some people believe that Kartra salient or the North Caucasian languages,

216
00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.040
or both are related to Basque.

217
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:19.390
That's because of some shared features like ergotism and poly personal verbs.

218
00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:23.290
The basket cart really in connection is not widely believed anymore,

219
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.010
but there are still some who think basket might be very distantly related to the

220
00:13:27.011 --> 00:13:29.830
North Caucasian languages, Denae Caucasian.

221
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.300
This is a proposed language family spanning Eurasia and North America,

222
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:38.290
which includes North Caucasian Buddha Shefsky in Pakistan,

223
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:43.630
see Tibetan Yenisei in the nod, Denae languages and the vest, conic languages,

224
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:44.650
including Basque.

225
00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:48.610
This theory is not widely accepted and remains very controversial.

226
00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.490
The huge linguistic diversity of the caucuses,

227
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:55.180
as well as the difficulty in clearly determining the connection between the

228
00:13:55.181 --> 00:13:59.260
different languages there makes it a fascinating region to examine Caucasian

229
00:13:59.261 --> 00:14:02.830
languages also have quite different features from languages elsewhere,

230
00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.680
which makes learning about them a mind-bending experience.

231
00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.450
The question of the day.

232
00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:11.200
What do you think about some of the unique features of Caucasian languages that

233
00:14:11.201 --> 00:14:14.830
I talked about in this video? Do any of these features appear in your language?

234
00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.860
A big, special, thanks goes out to my Patrion supporters,

235
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.110
especially these ones right here on the screen.

236
00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.090
They're my top tier Patrion supporters.

237
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.660
And that's why their names appear in the video patrons of different tiers get

238
00:14:25.661 --> 00:14:29.950
different benefits, such as access to the private Lang focus online community,

239
