<v 0>Before I start, I want to mention my sponsor for this video.</v>

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.770
Portuguese pod one Oh one pod one Oh one courses are among my favorite language

tools, especially for listening and shadowing.

Why not click the link in the description for a free account and give it a try.

5
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.740
I'm sure you've heard of the Portuguese language,

6
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.250
but I know that some of you have never heard of the Galician language,

7
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.950
but today I'm going to talk about Galician and its connection to Portuguese.

8
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.940
Galician is a member of the barrel romance branch of the romance language

9
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.560
family. It's spoken by around 2.4 million people. Most of them in Galicia.

10
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.230
Felicia is an autonomous region in Northwestern. Spain,

11
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.670
that borders Portugal to the South Galician is coefficient with Spanish in

12
00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:46.560
Galicia and by Spanish. I mean,

13
00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:51.120
Castilian Galician is a sister language of Portuguese with the two of them

14
00:00:51.121 --> 00:00:54.510
sharing a common origin beginning and around the ninth century,

15
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.710
there was a romance language now referred to as Galicia and Portuguese though,

16
00:00:58.711 --> 00:01:01.770
at the time, it was simply considered a form of vulgar Latin.

17
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.390
This language began diverging into distinct Galician and Portuguese languages.

18
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.860
During the 13th century,

19
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.850
the County of Portugal was originally part of the kingdom of Galicia,

20
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.860
which was part of the kingdom of Leyland,

21
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.330
but it became the independent kingdom of Portugal in the year, 1139.

22
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.800
And it began expanding its border southward while they seized territory from the

23
00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:25.800
Moors as the [inaudible] progressed, naturally,

24
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.480
they brought their language with them towards the South in the year 1230 Lael,

25
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.080
including Galicia was incorporated into the crown of Casteel.

26
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.740
And they were incorporated into Spain in the year, 15, 16,

27
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.850
the varieties of Galicia and Portuguese spoken to the North in Galicia.

28
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.870
And those spoken to the South in Portugal began to gradually become more

29
00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:50.190
distinct until they were eventually thought of as separate languages because

30
00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:54.090
Galician and Portuguese are still so similar today and have a high level of

31
00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:55.380
mutual intelligibility.

32
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.310
You may hear some people say that Galician is a dialect of Portuguese,

33
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.270
but that's not accurate because it makes it sound like Galician developed from

34
00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:04.890
Portuguese. When in reality,

35
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.970
they both developed from the same medieval language referred to as Galician

36
00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:13.380
Portuguese people really only say that Galician has a dialect of Portuguese

37
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.520
because Portuguese is the more well-known language, the more famous language.

38
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.720
So instead you could say that they are two varieties of the same language rather

39
00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:24.330
than saying Galician is a dialect of Portuguese,

40
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.930
and indeed they are more similar than dialects of some languages are,

41
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.390
but they have separate standard languages.

42
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.620
And deletion is associated with a culture that's distinct from the Portuguese

43
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.320
and from their former colonies. In many cases,

44
00:02:37.321 --> 00:02:40.710
these are the two factors that determine whether two similar ways of

45
00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:45.210
communicating are dialects of a single language or distinct languages though.

46
00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:49.560
There is no universal criteria for how to determine that there are very similar

47
00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:51.390
in terms of grammar and vocabulary,

48
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.200
but there are lots of little differences in their phonology and orthography in

49
00:02:55.201 --> 00:02:58.170
large part due to the influence of Castilian on Galician

50
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:01.773
[inaudible].

51
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.260
<v 1>[Inaudible] they must reduce any mice</v>

52
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.383
[inaudible] [inaudible] or

53
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.873

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.143
[inaudible].

57
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.140
<v 0>Numerous differences in the consonant sounds of Galician and Portuguese.</v>

58
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.830
There's no Vogue sound in Galician though. There is in Portuguese,

59
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.810
in Galician B and V represent the same phoneme book as in Spanish

60
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.060
it's Bo or a voiced by labial fricative note that this happens in

61
00:03:54.061 --> 00:03:58.350
Northern Portugal too. For example, the word for cowl in deletion,

62
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.180
in standard pronunciation at the beginning of a word like this,

63
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.860
it would be BA but the speaker on the recording seems to say it as a fricative

64
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.690
look, listen to the pronunciation on this Galician dictionary site Bucca

65
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.493
and in Portuguese.

66
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.600
<v 2>Up the word for cave in deletion and in</v>

67
00:04:21.601 --> 00:04:22.830
Portuguese covert.

68
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.390
<v 0>Note that this word is used slightly differently in Portuguese, meaning cavity,</v>

69
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.890
cavern, or grave. Sometimes the difference is also reflected in writing,

70
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.990
for example, the word for edible in Galician and in Portuguese.

71
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.940
<v 2>Another.</v>

72
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.140
<v 0>Difference in Portuguese S is pronounced Z between vowels,</v>

73
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.210
but not in Galician. For example,

74
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.170
the word for house in Galician and in Portuguese,

75
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.690
the word for thing in Galician and in Portuguese

76
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.710
In Galician C represents a voiceless dental fricative before I N

77
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.050
E as in Spanish, for example,

78
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.430
the word for five in Galician and in Portuguese.

79
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.530
<v 2>Seeing another.</v>

80
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:11.670
<v 0>One in Galician,</v>

81
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.530
the diagraph C H is pronounced Chuck in Portuguese it's ship.

82
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.270
For example, the verb,

83
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.590
meaning to call in deletion and in Portuguese.

84
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.050
<v 2>Shamara. Another difference.</v>

85
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.640
<v 0>The Galician rhotic consonant is like the Spanish one, a trill or a tap.</v>

86
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.450
There is no guttural rhotic sound like in Portuguese, for example,

87
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.770
the word meaning rich in Galician and in Portuguese.

88
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.150
<v 2>In.</v>

89
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.120
<v 0>Galicia, there are no phonemic nasal vowels.</v>

90
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.780
There are vowels that become nasalized due to their surrounding environment.

91
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.270
In other words, they're next to a nasal consonant,

92
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.230
but there are no pairs of words that are distinguished by vowel mentality.

93
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.273
And Valdez.

94
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.920
Ality is not a part of Galician orthography the word for bread in deletion.

95
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.980
And in Portuguese here,

96
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:04.940
you can see that the nasal vowel that existed in Galicia and Portuguese has been

97
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:08.620
lost in Galician, but remains in Portuguese in Galician.

98
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:09.800
There's a nasal consonant.

99
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:14.030
Instead note that when N comes at the end of a word in Galician,

100
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.800
it's pronounced NA rather than nuh also notice the loss of the diphthong

101
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.570
the word for brother in Galicia.

102
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.390
<v 1>Either mine or either mouth.</v>

103
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.340
<v 0>And in Portuguese you'd mail it among is the standard form and used in</v>

104
00:06:30.341 --> 00:06:35.050
Western dialect while either Mo is used in central and Eastern dialects.

105
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.750
It among seems more similar to Castilian,

106
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.400
had a model judging by its nasal consonant and lack of a diphthong you to Mo

107
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.370
retains the diphthong that is also found in Portuguese.

108
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.290
But when there's a diphthong in Galician,

109
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.720
there's no nasal whether a vowel or a consonant.

110
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:51.670
We can see this in numerous words,

111
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:56.170
such as the word for hand and the plural form, Hans in Galician.

112
00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.570
<v 1>Man, man's mouth mouse.</v>

113
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.930
<v 0>In Portuguese mountain mountain.</v>

114
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.130
Some of the nouns in Portuguese with this nasal diphthong have a different

115
00:07:09.131 --> 00:07:12.910
plural form, but in deletion,

116
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.690
the plural remains the same simply add S medium.

117
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.250
<v 1>Mediums.</v>

118
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.720
<v 0>There are also cognates that have differences in nasal consonants,</v>

119
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.380
like the differences in the following, determiners, the words for ah,

120
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.140
or one in Galician. Ooh.

121
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:30.723
<v 1>Ooh.</v>

122
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:35.860
<v 0>And in Portuguese Wilmer the words for some in Galician.</v>

123
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.933
Hm.

124
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.670
<v 1>Aye. Aye. Aye.</v>

125
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:41.810
<v 0>Nope.</v>

126
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.670
That the first pair of words in Galician is standard and the second pair is

127
00:07:45.671 --> 00:07:48.070
dialectal. And now in Portuguese,

128
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.880
I'll go all the words for no, no.

129
00:07:51.881 --> 00:07:54.100
As a determiner in Galician. Yeah.

130
00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:58.590
<v 1>[Inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible].</v>

131
00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.720
<v 0>And in Portuguese pneuma,</v>

132
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:07.240
here are a few other differences in pronunciation and orthography Galician uses

133
00:08:07.241 --> 00:08:11.860
M with a Tilda and LL instead of NH and L H as in

134
00:08:11.861 --> 00:08:13.510
Portuguese, for example,

135
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:18.340
the words for line in Galician and in Portuguese, Lena,

136
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:23.860
the word for red in Galician and in Portuguese for module,

137
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:28.090
you will notice that cognate words are often written with different vowel

138
00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:32.290
accents or one will have a written accent. And the other won't for example,

139
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:36.550
the word for moon in Galician and in Portuguese

140
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.430
and the verb form, meaning I ate,

141
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.450
or I was eating in Galician and in Portuguese

142
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:50.590
Galician uses the letter X to represent the sound of HSA of voiceless post

143
00:08:50.591 --> 00:08:51.670
alveolar fricative,

144
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.560
but Galician doesn't have a voice to post alveolar fricative Jew.

145
00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:00.060
So you'll notice words with Azure sound in Portuguese being used in Galician

146
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.360
with a shutter sound represented by X, for example,

147
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:07.110
the word for people in Galician ended Portuguese.

148
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:13.550
<v 2>The word for window in deletion and in Portuguese Chanel.</v>

149
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.620
<v 0>You'll also see some slightly different word forms. For example,</v>

150
00:09:18.621 --> 00:09:21.860
when prepositions contract with articles in Galician.

151
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:24.380
<v 1>And.</v>

152
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.360
<v 2>In Portuguese building build up.</v>

153
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:31.760
<v 0>This combination of preposition plus article means by that or for the along</v>

154
00:09:31.761 --> 00:09:34.250
with some other meanings. Here's an example sentence,

155
00:09:34.251 --> 00:09:35.540
meaning I did that for them.

156
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:39.020
<v 1>And fishing East [inaudible].</v>

157
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.820
<v 0>I see a couple of other differences here as well.</v>

158
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.820
Notice the different spelling of the demonstrative article,

159
00:09:46.821 --> 00:09:51.290
meaning that also notice the different forms the verb takes in either language

160
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:55.220
fishin versus fees. Both are the first person,

161
00:09:55.221 --> 00:09:57.620
singular prorate form of cognitive verbs,

162
00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:02.690
Galician [inaudible] and Portuguese Farzad verbs often take the same

163
00:10:02.691 --> 00:10:04.910
forms in both languages, but in this case,

164
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:09.380
they're a little different let's look at a somewhat bigger difference in verbs

165
00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:14.000
in Galician, the past perfect tense isn't conjugated with an auxiliary verb.

166
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:18.170
Here's the sentence meaning the teacher had already arrived in Galician

167
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.300
word for word it's. The teacher already had arrived.

168
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:27.170
This verb form here is the third person singular PLU, perfect form.

169
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:31.340
Portuguese does actually have that same tense that is used in Galician,

170
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.350
but it's not used in spoken Portuguese.

171
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:36.470
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

172
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:40.460
<v 0>Word for word it's. The teacher already had arrived here.</v>

173
00:10:40.461 --> 00:10:44.180
We can see that the past perfect is expressed with a compound tense.

174
00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:49.070
The auxiliary verb is the first person singular imperfect form of, of ed,

175
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.010
which means have at least as an auxiliary verb,

176
00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:57.230
it's followed by the masculine singular past participle love Chicago Galician

177
00:10:57.231 --> 00:10:59.510
doesn't use compound tenses in general.

178
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:03.530
Simple tenses are usually used in their place. Pronouns,

179
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.940
Galician and European Portuguese pronouns are generally the same though.

180
00:11:07.941 --> 00:11:10.310
There are some little differences in Portuguese.

181
00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:15.170
The second person singular familiar pronoun is to add in Galicia nits

182
00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:16.850
tea. And in Portuguese,

183
00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.560
there is just one equivalent pronoun for both direct and indirect objects to

184
00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:26.840
in Galician. There are two Tay and check in standard Galician. There are both,

185
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.340
but depending on the dialect,

186
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:33.080
many speakers use either tank for both direct object and indirect object or

187
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:36.050
Che for both direct object and indirect object.

188
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:40.130
Now let's look at some more example sentences and break them down.

189
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:44.630
These sentences mean Galician is a sister language of Portuguese in Portuguese.

190
00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:48.350
<v 2>He's Jewish and then Galician.</v>

191
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:53.680
<v 1>Oh, by LIGO [inaudible] word word it's.</v>

192
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:54.220
The.

193
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.060
<v 0>Galician is a language sister of the Portuguese.</v>

194
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.690
Notice the difference in the indefinite article that we saw earlier,

195
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:06.670
notice that the Galician article has the letters N H which represent the sound.

196
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:11.980
No. While the Portuguese article simply has an M representing a sound

197
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:16.690
next, we see an acute accent marking the Portuguese word lingua,

198
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:21.010
but not in Galician. Next notice the differences in the word for sister,

199
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.530
similar to the words for brother that we saw earlier,

200
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:28.060
the Galician word has no nasal vowel yet notice the acute accent above the

201
00:12:28.061 --> 00:12:32.710
letter. A we also see different diacritics over the words for Portuguese

202
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.980
diacritics in Galician are much simpler than in Portuguese.

203
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.440
Vowels can take only an acute accent,

204
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:42.430
which usually represents the primary stress of the word when it's not in the

205
00:12:42.431 --> 00:12:44.500
default location in Portuguese,

206
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.440
the acute accent is used to show primary stress,

207
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:51.730
but only for low vowels while the circumflex indicates the equivalent high

208
00:12:51.731 --> 00:12:54.880
vowel, then there is E which is always a high vowel,

209
00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:59.740
but Grove accent is used to show the contraction of two side-by-side vowels.

210
00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.850
Normally the preposition, ah, and an article or demonstrative pronoun.

211
00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:08.530
And of course the Portuguese uses this symbol to indicate phonemic nasal vowels,

212
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.360
but this doesn't occur in Galatians.

213
00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.000
One last thing to note in the sentence here,

214
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:17.410
we see that the combination of the preposition do or day and the definite

215
00:13:17.411 --> 00:13:19.960
article, Oh, is the same in both languages.

216
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:23.710
Remember we saw some earlier that have different forms, but in this case,

217
00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.950
they're the same one more pair of sentences.

218
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:31.120
These sentences mean I've been working for 12 hours in Portuguese

219
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.080
word for word it's. I am to work.

220
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:38.080
There is 12 hours and then Galena.

221
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:41.483
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

222
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.160
<v 0>I take working 12 hours,</v>

223
00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.850
but the woman you hear in the video told me that it might be more natural for a

224
00:13:47.851 --> 00:13:50.280
Galician to use the word for a dozen. Instead.

225
00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:53.880
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

226
00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.960
<v 0>This pair of sentences. We see some more significant differences. First of all,</v>

227
00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:59.730
the way of expressing the present.

228
00:13:59.731 --> 00:14:03.330
Perfect progressive meaning in either language is different in European

229
00:14:03.331 --> 00:14:07.230
Portuguese, it would be like this with the present tense of the auxiliary verb,

230
00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.890
meaning to be plus the infinitive of the main verb.

231
00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:13.290
This is actually the present progressive form,

232
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.770
but it's often used where the present perfect progressive would be used in

233
00:14:16.771 --> 00:14:19.080
English and in Brazilian Portuguese,

234
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:23.040
this would be the present participle rather than the infinitive here.

235
00:14:23.041 --> 00:14:26.730
You see the first person singular present tense of the verb LVAD,

236
00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:30.090
which means take though it is also used with the meaning of,

237
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:34.080
to spend time doing something it's followed by the present participle.

238
00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:38.880
So the way it's expressed is like saying I spend 12 hours working in

239
00:14:38.881 --> 00:14:39.714
Portuguese.

240
00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:44.880
Levada is not really used in this way with the meaning of spend time doing let's

241
00:14:44.881 --> 00:14:49.320
take a look at how that verb LVAD is conjugated in the present tense in both

242
00:14:49.321 --> 00:14:51.650
languages to see how similar forms are.

243
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.320
<v 3>You'll live to leverage your lever fossil</v>

244
00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:58.213
fuels level.

245
00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:07.090
<v 0>Notice that only the second and third person,</v>

246
00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:10.060
plural forms are slightly different. And in pronunciation,

247
00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:12.370
the sound represented by V is different.

248
00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:17.290
You can probably see why Galician and Portuguese share a very high degree of

249
00:15:17.291 --> 00:15:19.210
mutual intelligibility. And by the way,

250
00:15:19.211 --> 00:15:21.610
that's also true for Brazilian Portuguese,

251
00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:25.810
even though the samples in the video were for European Portuguese. In fact,

252
00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.800
some people say that Galician is closer to Brazilian Portuguese than it is to

253
00:15:29.801 --> 00:15:34.570
European Portuguese or Galician and Portuguese varieties of a single language.

254
00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.740
Well, linguistically they genuinely seemed similar enough that they could be

255
00:15:38.741 --> 00:15:41.620
considered a single language. And as I mentioned before,

256
00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:45.430
you could say that together, they form one plurry centric language,

257
00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:49.840
one language with multiple standard varieties. But as I mentioned before,

258
00:15:49.841 --> 00:15:54.130
it's often cultural or national identity that determines what is considered a

259
00:15:54.131 --> 00:15:56.800
distinct language versus a variety of a language.

260
00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:01.480
If history had taken a different turn and Galicia and Portugal today formed a

261
00:16:01.481 --> 00:16:02.350
single country,

262
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:06.190
I'm sure that all Galician dialects and all Portuguese dialects would be

263
00:16:06.191 --> 00:16:08.560
considered varieties of a single language.

264
00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:13.720
Would it be called deletion or Portuguese or something else who knows the

265
00:16:13.721 --> 00:16:17.050
question of the day to native speakers of Portuguese and Galician,

266
00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:18.070
in your opinion,

267
00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:22.240
do you speak varieties of a single language or do you speak different languages?

268
00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:26.410
Why do you think so? And to other people disregarding cultural issues,

269
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.920
do you think they seem like different languages or varieties of a single

270
00:16:29.921 --> 00:16:32.590
language? And this is the part of the video.

271
00:16:32.591 --> 00:16:34.870
When I say thanks to my Patrion patrons,

272
00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.320
especially it might talk to your patrons whose names appear on the screen.

273
00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:42.310
I want to give a very special thanks to them and to everyone.

274
00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:45.070
Thank you for watching and have a nice day.

275
00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:09.610
Oh, you're still here. Okay. Well, here's one more pair of sentences for you.

276
00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:13.540
These sentences mean I want to buy some clothes in Galician.

277
00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:16.930
<v 3>And in Portuguese.</v>

278
00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:22.210
<v 0>Word for word, I want buy some clothes.</v>

279
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.160
These sentences are quite similar,

280
00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:26.770
but you can see that the word for buy is different.

281
00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:31.930
The Galician word Medicard used to have the meaning of trade as in to buy and

282
00:17:31.931 --> 00:17:34.510
sell goods. According to several dictionaries,

283
00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:38.170
Medicard still exists in Portuguese with that meaning too, though.

284
00:17:38.171 --> 00:17:40.150
It seems it's not commonly used anymore.

285
00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:45.070
The Portuguese word [inaudible] is also used in Galician as a synonym of

286
00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:45.933
Medicard.

287
00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:50.430
We also see the slightly different determiners that we saw before Galician

288
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.520
and Portuguese. I'll go, man.
