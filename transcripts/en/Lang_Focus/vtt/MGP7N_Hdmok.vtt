00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.770
<v 0>Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Lang focus channel. And my name is Paul.</v>

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.870
One question that I'm frequently asked is what language is most closely related

3
00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:13.080
to English? Well, some people would say Scots,

4
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.370
but that's debated because other people would say that Scott's is a variety of

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.260
English leaving that debate aside. If we think of English and Scots together,

6
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.170
then what language is most closely related to them?

7
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.810
The answer is the Phrygian language,

8
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.650
or maybe I should say the Friesian languages in the plural.

9
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.550
Anglo Friesian is a sub-branch of the West Germanic languages.

10
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.180
It consists of the unblock languages, English and Scots.

11
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.700
Or you can think of this as just English, if you want.

12
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.350
And the Friesian languages,

13
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.450
a group of closely related languages that developed from old Friesian old

14
00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:51.360
Friesian and old English were very close to each other,

15
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.810
but that doesn't mean that Friesian and English are mutually intelligible.

16
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.340
Today. English has changed dramatically due to contact with other languages like

17
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.330
Norman, French,

18
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.890
and the various varieties of Friesian have been influenced by Germanic languages

19
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:06.360
in their respective regions.

20
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.560
The most widely spoken Friesian language by far is West Friesian,

21
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.650
which is spoken by over 450,000 people,

22
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.170
mainly in the free slump province of the Netherlands,

23
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.580
where it's coefficient with Dutch at the provincial level. Then there's North,

24
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:25.200
Friesian spoken in parts of the state of shoelace V Holstine in

25
00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:26.070
Northern Germany.

26
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.390
It's spoken by fewer than 10,000 people and is considered endangered.

27
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.150
Then there's softer land Friesian,

28
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.010
which is only spoken by a couple of thousand people in one municipality software

29
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:40.680
lumped in the lower Saxony state in Germany,

30
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.680
softer lumped Friesian is seriously endangered.

31
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.510
As most of its speakers are older.

32
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.010
All three Friesian languages consist of a number of dialects,

33
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.420
even softer lumped freezer with three villages, having their own dialects.

34
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.490
Friesian used to be spoken over a much wider area of the North sea coast.

35
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.210
Old Friesian was spoken and written throughout the 15th century,

36
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.610
but lost its status as a written language.

37
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.140
When rulers of free slump made Dutch the dominant language first under Duke

38
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.620
Albert, the third of Saxony, then under Habsburg rule,

39
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.360
then under an independent Netherlands in which Holland was dominant a quick side

40
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:21.390
note. What's the difference between Holland and Netherlands?

41
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.520
I thought they were the same. Nope,

42
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.030
just like England is only one part of the United Kingdom.

43
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.780
Holland is only one part of the Netherlands, actually two parts,

44
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.120
the provinces of North Holland and South Holland.

45
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.260
The other provinces including free Friesland are part of the Netherlands,

46
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.430
but not part of Holland.

47
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.620
So Holland became the most influential part of the Netherlands and Dutch remains

48
00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:44.790
the dominant language.

49
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.960
Friesian became mainly a spoken language for a long time.

50
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.730
And this period coincides with the middle Friesian period over a century later

51
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.050
in the 17th century,

52
00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.250
Friesian poet geese belt Yupiks wrote poems and Friesian to revive it as a

53
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:02.410
literary language. Then Johann,

54
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.610
this hilar abyss began trying to standardize written frictions, orthography,

55
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:11.530
and pronunciation. While the APIX wrote in a more traditional literary style,

56
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:12.460
he loved this,

57
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.420
tried to make the standard language more similar to how people actually spoke

58
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.040
another Friesian Yahoo, Hulbert, smart, translated, many plays and books,

59
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:23.500
including the Bible into modern West Friesian.

60
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.460
And this is what really started the movement to preserve modern West Friesian.

61
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.660
And that movement picked up in the early 20th century and continues till this

62
00:03:31.661 --> 00:03:35.140
day. So what is modern Friesian like, well,

63
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.890
that depends on which of the three main varieties we're talking about because

64
00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:42.670
they are distinct languages in this video. We'll focus on West.

65
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:46.240
Friesian the most widely spoken Friesian language. First,

66
00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:50.830
some basic phrases in West region. Hello. Good morning.

67
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.380
<v 1>Gleam on please. Uh, she blazed I'd like some coffee please.</v>

68
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.080
[inaudible] thank you. Tongal thank you very much. Diesel Doug.

69
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.180
<v 0>Note that unlike English Frisian doesn't have dental fricative sounds like pho</v>

70
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.990
as an English. Thank you. Or the, as an English that,

71
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.580
excuse me, where's the restroom.

72
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.080
I understand. I don't understand.

73
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:21.570
I love free salons.

74
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.410
<v 1>It called from fresh lawn. Holy sh Blix gender.</v>

75
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.140
<v 0>Now let's examine some sentences in Friesian the sentence means those are her</v>

76
00:04:31.141 --> 00:04:31.974
books.

77
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.630
<v 1>As.</v>

78
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.840
<v 0>You can see the syntax here is the same in both languages.</v>

79
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.670
And most of the words are all cognitive. This one may look different,

80
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.340
but it resembles the word bean in English. Doesn't it?

81
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.830
This is a form of the verb, meaning to beat,

82
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.100
which is cognate with the English word, but in West Africa,

83
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.140
the infinitive is which makes more sense. If you look at the past tense forms,

84
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.020
book-in is the plural form.

85
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.000
Frisian has two ways of forming the plural N or E N four nouns that have a

86
00:05:03.001 --> 00:05:07.500
stressed final syllable and S for nouns that end in unstressed

87
00:05:07.501 --> 00:05:08.190
syllables.

88
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.840
And also after diminutive vendings this sentence has a possessive adjective,

89
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.370
but how was possession shown? If we specify who the possessor is with a name,

90
00:05:17.371 --> 00:05:19.530
for example, those are FENOs.

91
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.363
<v 1>Books.</v>

92
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.960
<v 0>Possession can be expressed with agenda to vending on the note,</v>

93
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.220
similar to English,

94
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.110
apostrophe S old Frisian had a system of numerous grammatical cases

95
00:05:31.111 --> 00:05:33.180
for nouns, but just like in English,

96
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.060
those case forms have been lost except for the genitive.

97
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.480
But the genitive case form has become much less common to,

98
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.530
and now it's much more common to use the word fun to express possession

99
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:46.680
word for word it's.

100
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.450
Those are the books of FENa notice that the definite article the comes

101
00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:54.360
before the now and then fun comes after it.

102
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.120
Another way that might be even more common is this

103
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.720
[inaudible] Word. Those are her books.

104
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.140
The possessive adjective is used in place of the genitive ending.

105
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.280
It's interesting that these pair of frantic ways of expressing the genitive have

106
00:06:09.281 --> 00:06:11.410
become more common than the genitive ending.

107
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.280
It seems to show the continued erosion of the Friesian case system.

108
00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.950
Going back to this sentence for a second.

109
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.440
<v 1>Note, the.</v>

110
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.830
<v 0>Definite article D there is one more definite article.</v>

111
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.060
It Friesian has two grammatical genders, Coleman gender,

112
00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.440
and the neuter gender is used with singular common gender nouns.

113
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.030
And with all plural mounts,

114
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.530
it is used with singular neuter nouns book is neuter,

115
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.120
but it's in the plural form.

116
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.650
So it's definite article is the let's try making that sentence singular.

117
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.060
That is feminists book.

118
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.280
<v 1>Double-digit notice that.</v>

119
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.750
<v 0>The definite article is it because book is singular neuter. Also,</v>

120
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.000
as we saw before with the plural sentence,

121
00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.360
possession can be expressed in those other ways, too, though, this fan,

122
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.060
this is possible, but not common anymore.

123
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.220
<v 1>Delta spend the hot book is the most.</v>

124
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.053
<v 0>Common.</v>

125
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:09.040
You may have noticed that the demonstrative pronoun.like that in English

126
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.340
is used for both singular and plural. In other words,

127
00:07:12.341 --> 00:07:15.340
for both that and those in West Friesian,

128
00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.880
there's a distinction between demonstrative pronouns and demonstrative

129
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:23.590
adjectives. The demonstrative pronouns are DIT, meaning this or these Mr.

130
00:07:23.591 --> 00:07:26.800
For both genders and dot meaning that,

131
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.440
or those also used for both genders,

132
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:34.000
demonstrative pronouns are used as equivalents or substitutes of the noun.

133
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.740
Demonstrative adjectives are used to modify nouns and come directly before them

134
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.850
for common gender singular and for all plural nouns DISA,

135
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:47.170
meaning this or these and D meaning that or those.

136
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.630
And for neuter singular nouns, DIT,

137
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:54.760
meaning this and dot meaning that here's a pair of sentences to

138
00:07:54.761 --> 00:07:58.210
show you the distinction between demonstrative pronouns and demonstrative

139
00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.320
adjectives.

140
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.080
<v 1>Don't be in a horrible can. DBU can benefit from the heart.</v>

141
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.880
<v 0>Another sentence. She has read 15 books this year.</v>

142
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.520
<v 1>She had it a year, 15 book and Lazarus.</v>

143
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:10.810
<v 0>Word for word it's.</v>

144
00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:15.550
She has this year 15 books read this sentence begins with the

145
00:08:15.551 --> 00:08:19.120
personal pronoun sheet, which is a cognitive English sheet.

146
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:23.110
Basically all the personal pronouns in West Friesian are cognitive equivalents

147
00:08:23.111 --> 00:08:24.850
of the ones in English. Next,

148
00:08:24.851 --> 00:08:28.690
we see the third person singular present tense conjugation of the verb.

149
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.580
The present tense forms correspond quite closely with the English present tense

150
00:08:33.581 --> 00:08:36.490
forms. But look at the past tense forms in English.

151
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:41.050
The past tense conjugations collapsed into a single past tense form based on the

152
00:08:41.051 --> 00:08:43.030
first and third person singular forms,

153
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.750
but Friesian still maintains distinct past tense conjugations.

154
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.990
Next we see it DIT year. Meaning this year,

155
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.210
year is a neuter singular note.

156
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.850
So the demonstrative adjective is DIT rather than DISA. Next.

157
00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.080
We see the number 15, obviously a cognate with English 15.

158
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:02.610
Let's hear a few more numbers.

159
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.930
<v 1>An [inaudible] fee,</v>

160
00:09:05.931 --> 00:09:08.540
our fee if to return.

161
00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.900
<v 0>All of these numbers are cognate with English numbers,</v>

162
00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:15.440
but there's a difference in numbers like 34, three,

163
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:21.020
literally four and 30 lesson is the past participle form

164
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:21.800
of the verb.

165
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:26.780
Lazur meaning to read Lazur has cognates in numerous Germanic

166
00:09:26.781 --> 00:09:27.440
languages,

167
00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.330
including Dutch Layson and German lays in another sentence.

168
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.180
This one means we usually stay at home in the evening

169
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:40.880
Word for word it's. We stay normally in the evening at home.

170
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.470
The verb [inaudible] is a cognate of the English word, but live,

171
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:49.490
which means stay or remain. What is obsolete in the standard language?

172
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.600
Not a model is like normal or normally of course,

173
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.570
of course you could say normally in English as well,

174
00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:01.430
making these two sentences more similar units is the genitive form of

175
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.170
human, which means evening.

176
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:08.450
The genitive form of nouns is sometimes used as a temporal advert marker to form

177
00:10:08.451 --> 00:10:10.220
adverbs of time. Finally,

178
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:14.570
the word Touche was originally a contraction of two words, TA plus,

179
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:19.730
which this is the equivalent of the Dutch word toasts one final sentence.

180
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.820
Almost everyone went home early because of the storm.

181
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.060
<v 1>[Inaudible] was fun way for this to Adam.</v>

182
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.580
<v 0>It's almost everyone went early to home because of the storm.</v>

183
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:35.210
This word El Canadian can be broken down into two parts,

184
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.760
meaning precisely every plus one,

185
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.900
this word Ghia is the third person singular past tense,

186
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.330
conjugation of GaN, the verb,

187
00:10:44.331 --> 00:10:48.500
meaning to go in old English and an old Frisian. It was gone,

188
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.000
but teed one part of this word tead means time.

189
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:57.920
The first part is related to a preposition B meaning by or apt,

190
00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.580
but this is now an inseparable word fond with her.

191
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.200
This word means because of,

192
00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:07.430
but can be broken down into the parts meaning of plus way though,

193
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.380
because of the spelling of Wayfair.

194
00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:14.240
I think this might be a lone word from Dutch Von wafer. Finally,

195
00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:19.010
still autumn is a singular common gender now. So what's definite article is the,

196
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:20.180
rather than it.

197
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.070
Hopefully you can see that West Friesian is a language that shares much in

198
00:11:25.071 --> 00:11:26.060
common with English,

199
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.360
but that also shares a lot in common with other Germanic languages.

200
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.880
Sometimes seemingly more so than with English,

201
00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.290
but don't make the mistake of thinking that West Friesian is a dialect of Dutch

202
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:39.800
or that the other varieties of Friesian are dialects of German.

203
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:43.970
They are distinct languages that are worthy of recognition and preservation.

204
00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:48.470
The question of the day for native speakers of any of the Friesian languages,

205
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:52.370
how much do you use Friesian in your day-to-day life and how much do you use a

206
00:11:52.371 --> 00:11:54.940
different specifically Dutch or German?

207
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:59.230
And for other people does West Friesian seemed similar to English to you.

208
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.230
What stood out to you as being similar, a special,

209
00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:04.330
thanks goes out to my Patrion supporters,

210
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.150
especially these wonderful people right here on the screen.

211
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.480
They are my top tier Patrion supporters. So many extra special,

212
00:12:10.481 --> 00:12:12.100
thanks to them as always.

213
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:16.150
If you're interested in learning Friesian one place you can start is learn

214
00:12:16.151 --> 00:12:17.320
friesian.com.

215
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:21.310
The guy who runs the site actually provided the Friesian samples for this video.

216
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:25.330
It's a free language course. Something like duo lingo for Friesian.

217
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.180
So give it a try and to everyone.

218
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.210
Thank you for watching and have a nice day.
