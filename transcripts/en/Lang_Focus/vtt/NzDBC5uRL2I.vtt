00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.700
<v 0>Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Lang focus channel. And my name is Paul. Today.</v>

2
00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:08.220
We're going to look at the Wolf language.

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.430
Some of you have probably never even heard of Wolf before,

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.490
but it's an important language of West Africa.

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.400
And you might even know a little bit of Wolf already.

6
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.390
Wolf was one of the languages spoken among African slaves,

7
00:00:21.391 --> 00:00:22.590
brought to the Americas.

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.850
And a number of words that are off possible will of origin have entered American

9
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:29.760
English via African-American vernacular English.

10
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.680
Most of them were introduced into the mix main stream through the popularity of

11
00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:34.580
jazz music.

12
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.080
They include jive dig juke as in jukebox and hip.

13
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.930
These words may seem a bit out of date now,

14
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.740
but they were very important words in American culture. In the 20th century,

15
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.710
the word banana may also be of well of origin though.

16
00:00:48.711 --> 00:00:53.570
It entered English via Spanish or Portuguese Wolf is spoken by at least 6

17
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:54.403
million native speakers.

18
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.270
The vast majority of them in Senegal were around 40% of the population speaks it

19
00:00:59.271 --> 00:01:00.230
as a native language,

20
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.040
but Wolf is also used as a lingua franca throughout much of Senegal.

21
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.630
So including second language speakers around 80% of the population can speak it.

22
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.970
And I've seen estimates as high as 90%.

23
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.630
The official language of Senegal is French, not Wolf, but will,

24
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.070
if is the most widely spoken language it's also spoken by around 20% of the

25
00:01:19.071 --> 00:01:20.120
people in Gambia,

26
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.720
including more than half of the people in the capital city than Juul,

27
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.020
as well as around 7% of the people of Mauritania.

28
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.850
It's a member of the Senegambia in branch of the Nigeria Congo language family,

29
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.670
which is also known as the Northern Atlantic branch.

30
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.130
The name Wolf means people of loaf,

31
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.990
an area in present day Senegal where the jollof empire also known as the Wolf

32
00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:45.290
empire was established at the end of the 14th century.

33
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.710
It's the name of the Wolf ethnic group as well as their language,

34
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.400
because most wall of people converted to Islam in recent centuries.

35
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.720
And because of the presence of Arab traders in the region will have some Arabic

36
00:01:56.721 --> 00:01:59.240
influence. Some Arabic lone words include

37
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.100
the traditional Islamic greeting. Some of the days of the week,

38
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.680
Tuesday from Arabic,

39
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.280
[inaudible] Wednesday from Arabic

40
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.310
Thursday, from Arabic Al homies and, uh,

41
00:02:16.311 --> 00:02:20.240
Juma Friday from Arabic Algoma last

42
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.220
time or hour,

43
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.350
this is from Arabic walked or walk to which includes the Arabic nominative

44
00:02:27.351 --> 00:02:31.910
case ending. Ooh, there are some more words, but not that many, to be honest,

45
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.590
there has also been French influence on Wolf that's because Senegal is a former

46
00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:37.430
French colony,

47
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.410
the French established trading outposts there beginning in the 17th century and

48
00:02:42.411 --> 00:02:45.050
fully conquered Senegal. During the 19th century,

49
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.460
it remained a French colonial territory until 1960. The duck,

50
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.630
our variety of Wolf has the most French influence with numerous French lone

51
00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:57.020
words. The rural varieties of Wolf are more conservative.

52
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.150
We'll see some examples of French loan later. Some features of Wolfe,

53
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.750
the semi Gumby and languages, including Wallace do not have tones.

54
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.200
This sets them apart from most of the Nigeria Congo language family,

55
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.450
like other languages in its family. Well, if contains pre nasalized continence,

56
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.330
these are combinations of nasal sounds and stops,

57
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.070
which function as individual continents like most Niger Congo languages

58
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.230
Wolf has a system of known classes,

59
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.100
categories of different types of nouns that are represented by specific

60
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:31.480
inflections. But Willow is unique in that the noun itself is not inflicted,

61
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.500
but rather it's typically the definite article that is inflected. For example,

62
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.180
the shirt and miss V the cat moves me,

63
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.920
the woman [inaudible] the earth [inaudible] now in class

64
00:03:43.921 --> 00:03:47.520
inflection can be seen in the first consonant of the definite article.

65
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.240
There are 10 mountain classes, including two plural classes though,

66
00:03:51.241 --> 00:03:55.350
understand that an urban Wolf B has replaced the others to a large extent.

67
00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.790
Wolf has no separate grammatical category of adjectives.

68
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.240
Instead there's a category of verbs called state of verbs,

69
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.330
which indicates States, conditions, feelings, et cetera.

70
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.220
These are used in set of adjectives.

71
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.860
Wolf has three sets of personal pronouns, independent pronouns, object,

72
00:04:13.861 --> 00:04:18.630
pronouns, and subject pronouns. Independent pronouns are used for emphasis.

73
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.590
And to answer questions similar to the disjunctive pronouns in French,

74
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.920
independent pronouns and object pronouns have fixed forms,

75
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.930
but subject pronouns have many different forms in the Wolf verb system.

76
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.310
The verb itself is not conjugated, but rather the subject pronoun is inflected.

77
00:04:35.311 --> 00:04:39.030
Instead the subject pronouns indicate not only person and number,

78
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.110
but can also indicate time, normally aspect rather than tents,

79
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.180
as well as focus. It can be verbal focus, object, focus, or subject focus.

80
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.410
There are three types of verbs in Wolf action, verbs, identity, verbs,

81
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.750
and state of verbs, which we mentioned before.

82
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.800
Identity verbs are verbs that give basic information about you and your

83
00:04:58.801 --> 00:05:02.400
background such as dude, to be named yoga,

84
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.060
to come from you do to be born. And so on.

85
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.510
These three types of verbs are important because they're used in different

86
00:05:09.511 --> 00:05:12.780
verbal constructions, different conjugations, if you will.

87
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.611
All right,

88
00:05:14.611 --> 00:05:18.030
let's jump right into some sentences and see some of these features in action.

89
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.750
This sentence means what's your name,

90
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.700
word for word it's how you singular named [inaudible] is an

91
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:27.990
object focused pronoun.

92
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.940
It's focusing our attention on the word NUCCA meaning how so it's often used in

93
00:05:32.941 --> 00:05:37.350
asking or answering questions that identify the object or compliment this.

94
00:05:37.351 --> 00:05:41.400
Here is the second person, singular object focused pronoun, to be clear.

95
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.390
There's a full set of these object focused pronouns for the various persons and

96
00:05:45.391 --> 00:05:47.820
numbers. These are subject pronouns,

97
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.780
but they have the added function of telling us to focus on or emphasize the

98
00:05:51.781 --> 00:05:56.100
object. This is one set of subject pronouns with that specific function,

99
00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.930
but there are numerous other sets of subject pronouns with different functions.

100
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.520
<v 1>Here too.</v>

101
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.170
<v 0>Is the identity verb,</v>

102
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.950
meaning to be from note that this question is often contracted.

103
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.110
<v 1>To know to do with not.</v>

104
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.210
<v 0>Being a contraction of NACA and God,</v>

105
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.360
but I give you the full form to show how the underlying sentence.

106
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.790
<v 1>And says constructed an answer might be good to do.</v>

107
00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.740
<v 0>Word for word it's Gorda. That's a name I named in this reply.</v>

108
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.190
LA is the first person singular object focused pronoun.

109
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.420
One thing to note is that Wolf typically follows an SVO word order,

110
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:36.430
but in an object focused sentence with a verb it's O S V to give a greater sense

111
00:06:36.431 --> 00:06:41.080
of the object focus. Maybe in English, we could translate this as it is Gora.

112
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:46.000
<v 1>I am called here's another sentence with object focus, similarly,</v>

113
00:06:46.001 --> 00:06:48.010
gala. This means.

114
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.220
<v 0>I love my job, or it is my job that I love.</v>

115
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.740
Maybe you'd say this in response to a question,

116
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.880
asking what you love about your life. Now let's make this a subject focus.

117
00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.820
<v 1>Sentence. My big somebody gay. This means.</v>

118
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.740
<v 0>I love my job with the emphasis on the subject. I maybe you'd say this.</v>

119
00:07:05.741 --> 00:07:09.310
If someone asks, who loves their job, overhearing your conversation.

120
00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.260
Now let's make this a verb focus.

121
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.350
<v 1>[Inaudible] this means.</v>

122
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.740
<v 0>I love my job with the emphasis on love.</v>

123
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.850
Maybe you say this in response to someone asking if you dislike your job.

124
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.820
Notice again, that in the object focused sentence,

125
00:07:24.821 --> 00:07:26.470
the object comes at the beginning.

126
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.620
Also remember that these are subject pronouns,

127
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.990
which include the additional meaning of focus.

128
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.110
These ones here are only the first person singular forms,

129
00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.420
which are part of wider sets of pronouns.

130
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.340
<v 1>This form here.</v>

131
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.500
<v 0>Indicates verbal focus for action verbs.</v>

132
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.500
But when it's a state of verb that functions like an adjective,

133
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.380
then this form draws our attention to a state or can.

134
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.320
<v 1>Does the tongue it's hot here.</v>

135
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.170
<v 0>Tongued is a state of verb. Meaning to be hot.</v>

136
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.820
This construction is often used to explain a reason or cause let's look at

137
00:07:57.821 --> 00:08:01.780
another sentence. This means they're having breakfast.

138
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.320
This sentence contains a different kind of pronoun called a preventative

139
00:08:05.321 --> 00:08:07.930
pronoun. These pronouns don't have any focus,

140
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.270
but rather indicate an aspect of time.

141
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:13.510
They tell us that some action or condition is currently true.

142
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.010
This part here in geek,

143
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:19.570
on its own means here like the action or condition you can see right in front of

144
00:08:19.571 --> 00:08:23.980
you with an action verb. This particle E is added to the end of the pronoun,

145
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.650
which makes it like the present continuous in English.

146
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.180
But with an identity verb,

147
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:31.120
it tells us something about someone's current identity.

148
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:35.320
Even if that part of the person's identity stems from an occurrence in the past.

149
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.790
<v 1>Lyndon, Dick buddy, I live in Paris. Lindy.</v>

150
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.200
I grew up in Dakar.

151
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:43.630
<v 0>With identity verbs.</v>

152
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:47.980
The E affix is missing from the pronoun because your identity is not a present

153
00:08:47.981 --> 00:08:51.520
continuous action. It's your current state. It's who you are.

154
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:55.890
If you think about the way these presentive pronouns are used with verbs,

155
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.250
you can see that they don't indicate tents, but rather aspect.

156
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.780
They show that a condition is ongoing, even if it was caused by a past action.

157
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.490
Another sentence.

158
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:08.070
<v 1>This.</v>

159
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:11.520
<v 0>Means we ate before you arrived word for word it eat.</v>

160
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.750
We perfective before you arrive. This verb.

161
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.460
Liquor is an action verb. It's related to the word Leeka meaning food,

162
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:24.570
which derives from an Arabic word. As we saw before this pronoun,

163
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.080
Nunu is an enunciated pronoun or a perfective pronoun,

164
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.000
which shows completion of the action.

165
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:33.660
This is often used when the simple Pastore past perfect would be used in

166
00:09:33.661 --> 00:09:34.260
English.

167
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:38.640
I should point out that while Wolf has generally SVO in perfective sentences,

168
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.640
the verb comes at the beginning. So this is VSO.

169
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.140
The pronoun [inaudible] is a neutral pronoun that contains no time or focus

170
00:09:46.141 --> 00:09:50.970
element in a clause with latter meaning before there is no aspect or tents.

171
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.970
These neutral pronouns are also used a lot in speech.

172
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:57.150
In which case tents and aspect are understood from context.

173
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.830
One thing that might be confusing here is that in God is the same as the second

174
00:10:01.831 --> 00:10:05.130
person, singular object focused pronoun, which we saw before.

175
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.340
I probably should have used a different one of the neutral pronouns in this

176
00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:10.050
sentence to avoid that confusion.

177
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.870
When the perfective is used with a state of verb,

178
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.380
it doesn't indicate a past state. It indicates a present state.

179
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:20.520
The perfective indicates that the development of that state is completed.

180
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:21.893
<v 1>Um, notice.</v>

181
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:27.600
<v 0>This sentence means I already have a reservation word for word it's have I</v>

182
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.850
perfective reservation already,

183
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:33.210
not the French word [inaudible] here.

184
00:10:33.211 --> 00:10:37.560
You can see that a present state is expressed by the perfective form. Now,

185
00:10:37.561 --> 00:10:40.620
if we want to express a past state using a state of verb,

186
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.330
we can add a special past marker.

187
00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.710
<v 1>Um, I'm not [inaudible].</v>

188
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:49.940
<v 0>This means I already had a reservation rather than have a reservation.</v>

189
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:51.523
Another sentence.

190
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.260
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

191
00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:58.010
<v 0>This means tomorrow we'll go to the market word for word it's tomorrow.</v>

192
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.730
We imperfect go market. The in the sentence,

193
00:11:01.731 --> 00:11:05.180
we see a different type of subject pronoun that indicates future well,

194
00:11:05.181 --> 00:11:05.961
to be precise.

195
00:11:05.961 --> 00:11:10.190
It's the imperfection and indicates that an action has not been completed yet.

196
00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:14.210
Here we have the word for market, which comes from the French word, Marsha,

197
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.600
and it's followed by the definite article four. It's now in the class,

198
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:22.370
this one starting with a B the imperfection of pronouns do not always express

199
00:11:22.371 --> 00:11:26.900
future. If we add to them the suffix E which expresses continuous action,

200
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:30.290
that the imperfection of pronouns indicate a habitual action,

201
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.350
which would be expressed with the simple present tense in English.

202
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:36.710
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

203
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:39.740
<v 0>This means we go to the market every day here,</v>

204
00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:44.300
we see an imperfect of pronoun with the prefix E which makes this a habitual

205
00:11:44.301 --> 00:11:47.420
action. Like we go rather than a future action.

206
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:52.160
Like we will go in the phrase based boot neck base means day

207
00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:57.460
and brunette means each or every let's look at one last

208
00:11:57.461 --> 00:12:00.490
sentence. [inaudible]

209
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:03.790
this means the children aren't sleeping.

210
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.690
They're chatting word for word it's children that sleep negative.

211
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.970
They continuous chat.

212
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.480
This sentence is about actions that are in progress right now.

213
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.450
So here we see the preventative pronoun [inaudible]

214
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:16.450
, which indicates ongoing action that they are chatting right now, closer to the beginning of the sentence. We have this verb 

215
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:16.450
Nyla, which means sleep with a negative suffix, but no preventative

216
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:17.283
 pronoun. This negative suffix indicates person and number third person, plural, but it doesn't contain any information about time or focus. It's simply negative.

217
00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:40.060
This is the normal way of expressing the negative for all types of verb

218
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:40.923
constructions.

219
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:45.340
So the time and focus elements are understood from context here at the

220
00:12:45.341 --> 00:12:48.790
beginning, we see the phrase, Holly, which means the children.

221
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.430
He is a definite article for plural nouns.

222
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:55.720
There's one more definite article for plural nouns ne but that one is quite

223
00:12:55.721 --> 00:12:56.620
limited in use.

224
00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:00.880
These plural articles are two of the 10 definite articles that are marked for

225
00:13:00.881 --> 00:13:04.360
now in class. One less thing to note is the word wok tan.

226
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.010
The root of this word is wa which means to speak and the suffix ton

227
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.250
changes the meaning to chat. And it can also be unowned,

228
00:13:12.251 --> 00:13:13.930
meaning conversation or chat,

229
00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.660
but there are numerous other words built from this route.

230
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:21.070
There is meaning to have someone speak the causative form

231
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.220
side, which means to haggle or to bargain,

232
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.600
which means to repeat or restate and loss,

233
00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.860
which means to talk to yourself. And there's also a homonym of this word,

234
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.520
meaning time or hour, which comes from the Arabic word walk to,

235
00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.200
as you can see, Wolf is a very interesting language.

236
00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.680
And one that might work quite differently from your native language or any other

237
00:13:43.681 --> 00:13:45.210
language that you've studied before,

238
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:48.240
perhaps its standout feature is its verbal system,

239
00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:51.360
which makes extensive use of inflected pronouns,

240
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:55.650
which work together with largely unchangeable verbs to create a rich system of

241
00:13:55.651 --> 00:13:57.510
expression. In this video,

242
00:13:57.511 --> 00:14:01.110
we merely scratched the surface and there are more constructions that indicate

243
00:14:01.111 --> 00:14:03.090
different times aspects and moods.

244
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.510
And there are additional features of the language that are beyond the scope of

245
00:14:06.511 --> 00:14:07.344
this video,

246
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:10.380
but hopefully it's sparked your interest and you learn something new.

247
00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:13.710
The question of the day to native speakers of Wolf.

248
00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:15.210
If there are any of you watching,

249
00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.000
what differences do you notice between urban Wolf,

250
00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.610
especially that of Ducker and rural Wolf?

251
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.290
Are they major differences and to anyone who has visited Senegal or another Wolf

252
00:14:25.291 --> 00:14:30.270
speaking area, did you learn any Wolf? If so, what was your experience? If not,

253
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.770
were you able to get around using French or English if you enjoyed this video,

254
00:14:34.771 --> 00:14:38.490
be sure to check out Lang focused on the various social media platforms like

255
00:14:38.491 --> 00:14:42.270
Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram. And as always,

256
00:14:42.271 --> 00:14:45.180
I'd like to give a special thanks to my Patrion supporters,

257
00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.370
especially my top two,

258
00:14:46.371 --> 00:14:49.380
your Patriot and supporters who you see right here on the screen,

259
00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:52.460
many special thanks to them and to everyone.

260
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:55.550
Thank you for watching and have a nice day.

261
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:14.080
<v 2>Okay.</v>
