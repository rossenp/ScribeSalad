00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.700
Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Lang focus channel. And my name is Johansson.

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.100
<v 1>Today.</v>

8
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.050
<v 0>We're going to compare Danish and Norwegian specifically one of the two official</v>

9
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:32.580
forms of Norwegian boot mall due to the union of Denmark and Norway,

10
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.590
which lasted for centuries mall is largely based on the Danish spoken by the

11
00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:39.720
upper classes and Norway. During that time,

12
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.670
they initially book mall are in large part the same with some slight differences

13
00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:48.090
in grammar and spelling, some different vocabulary, words and usage,

14
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.000
and more than anything else, differences in pronunciation.

15
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.650
Danish is famous for being difficult to understand because of the tendency to

16
00:00:55.651 --> 00:00:59.880
slur and delete sounds that are more clearly pronounced in Norwegian to be

17
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:00.270
clear,

18
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.190
Norwegian has no official pronunciation and all accents are considered correct,

19
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.690
but the pronunciation,

20
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.680
the accent of the capital Oslo serves as a defacto standard.

21
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.400
Let's compare some basic vocabulary and see where the differences lie.

22
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.340
Especially in pronunciation in Norwegian,

23
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.200
we have this word meaning weird or funny in Danish

24
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.840
means pleasant. Also notice the difference in the R sound in Norwegian.

25
00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:30.180
It's an alveolar trill in Danish.

26
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.900
It's a uvular fricative or approximate at the beginning of the word.

27
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.140
And at the end of the word, it's silent, but in its place,

28
00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:42.030
we can hear stew the glottal stop or creaky voice that appears in some

29
00:01:42.031 --> 00:01:46.440
Danish words, it's represented in IPA transcription by this symbol,

30
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.600
Norwegian doesn't have this feature,

31
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.270
but instead has distinctions in pitch accent.

32
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.270
Both of these words mean knife.

33
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.350
<v 1>Can you, in both words.</v>

34
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.530
<v 0>The combination K N is pronounced the same,</v>

35
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.810
but in Norwegian I V is pronounced Eve while in Danish.

36
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.540
It's a diphthong you. And again,

37
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.600
the word ends in a global stop or laryngeal cricket.

38
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.583
<v 1>The voice,</v>

39
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.090
these words mean dress shoe LA Jolla.

40
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.860
<v 0>There's a subtle difference in the sound that KJ represents in either language</v>

41
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.750
in Norwegian it's, a voiceless palatal fricative while in Danish.

42
00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:28.670
It's cute in Danish.

43
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.630
It's a cluster of two sounds K followed by. Yeah,

44
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.850
because the second sound is palatal.

45
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.820
It ends up sounding somewhat similar to the Norwegian sound,

46
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.080
which is also palatal.

47
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.350
These words mean Deere in Norwegian and in Danish.

48
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.810
Notice the difference in the initial consonant in Danish cook and go can appear

49
00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:54.710
before a front vowel, but a Norwegian. They can't. So the diagraphs,

50
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.340
GJ and KJ are used to represent the different consonant.

51
00:02:58.341 --> 00:03:02.680
Sounds also notice the silence are in the Danish word.

52
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.580
These words mean shirt in Norwegian.

53
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.210
<v 2>Sure. And in Danish.</v>

54
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.010
<v 0>Again,</v>

55
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.900
notice the difference in the initial consonant this time represented by SKJ

56
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.430
in Norwegian it's HSA while in Dana skin.

57
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.410
There's also a difference in the vowel sound in Norwegian. It's more like, Ooh,

58
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.210
while in Danish, it's more like,

59
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.160
or because the Danish are after a vowel is pronounced as a vowel itself.

60
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.880
These words mean ship in Norwegian.

61
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.640
<v 2>Shi, and in Danish scheme.</v>

62
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.770
<v 0>Notice that in the Norwegian word,</v>

63
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.220
S K represents HSA while in the Danish word,

64
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.050
it represents SCA silent G occurs in both languages,

65
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.890
sometimes in the same context. And sometimes in different contexts,

66
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.510
these two words are cognates and both feature a silent G in Norwegian

67
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.220
dial-in meaning delicious or lovely. And in Danish daily,

68
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.730
meaning wonderful or lovely, and sometimes delicious.

69
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.370
Also notice the slightly different spelling.

70
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.610
There are lots of little spelling differences like this between Danish and

71
00:04:11.611 --> 00:04:16.230
Norwegian while delicious is a primary meaning of the Norwegian word in

72
00:04:16.231 --> 00:04:19.320
Danish. It's more common meaning as wonderful or lovely.

73
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.010
These words mean book in Norwegian.

74
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.110
<v 2>And a Danish.</v>

75
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.600
<v 0>Notice the final K in the Norwegian word and the G in the Danish word in</v>

76
00:04:30.601 --> 00:04:35.010
Danish, the final G is silent. The vowel represented by Oh,

77
00:04:35.011 --> 00:04:39.390
is also different in Norwegian. It's more like, Ooh, well in Danish,

78
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.740
it's more like all,

79
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.110
but here the OMG together actually form a diphthong these

80
00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:49.050
words mean guest or visitor in Norwegian.

81
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.810
<v 2>And in Danish. Yes.</v>

82
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.640
<v 0>Notice the difference at the beginning of the words in Norwegian G is silent</v>

83
00:04:56.641 --> 00:04:59.850
before J so it's simply you while in Danish.

84
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.770
It's like I said before in Danish, go can come before a front vowel,

85
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.150
but in Norwegian at camp,

86
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.170
these words mean evening in Norwegian.

87
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.780
<v 2>And in Danish often.</v>

88
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.350
<v 0>In Norwegian, often is also used,</v>

89
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.580
but it's less commonly used than Cavell and a little more old fashioned.

90
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.210
And in Danish, uh, cognitive, the Norwegian word exists,

91
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.820
but it's old fashioned and not used much anymore.

92
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.920
These words mean page or side in Norwegian.

93
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.040
<v 2>See the ad in Danish CU.</v>

94
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.740
<v 0>While these words look the same on paper,</v>

95
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.390
the Danish pronunciation has the soft D and the final vowel vanishes

96
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.973
CU.

97
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.060
Now let's look at some sentences in both languages and see how different they

98
00:05:48.061 --> 00:05:50.940
are. If you've seen my previous video on Norwegian,

99
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.710
you may recognize these sentences.

100
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.070
These sentences mean I want to eat in Norwegian visa and

101
00:05:58.071 --> 00:05:59.600
in Danish, that was BS.

102
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.730
We can see two sentences that are identical on paper. Of course,

103
00:06:03.731 --> 00:06:06.070
there are some slight differences in pronunciation,

104
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:11.080
but nothing really worth pointing out. Here's another sentence,

105
00:06:11.081 --> 00:06:14.230
meaning I haven't eaten anything today in Norwegian

106
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.050
and in Danish. Here's another sentence.

107
00:06:20.051 --> 00:06:24.460
That's very similar on paper with some differences in pronunciation and one word

108
00:06:24.461 --> 00:06:27.880
with a slightly different form in either language in Norwegian.

109
00:06:27.881 --> 00:06:32.620
There's the neutral singular of newsroom in Danish.

110
00:06:32.621 --> 00:06:36.070
There's the neutral singular of node.

111
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.080
Notice how the negation word is pronounced differently in either language in

112
00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:45.640
Norwegian and in Danish, IGA in Norwegian,

113
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:50.500
the double K represents a long continent in Danish [inaudible] and

114
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:55.840
CA are voiced when doubled the double letter does not indicate a long consonant

115
00:06:55.841 --> 00:06:56.674
in Danish.

116
00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:01.120
Also notice the difference in pronunciation of this word in Norwegian

117
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.260
and in Danish. The date in Norwegian,

118
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.040
the long a vowel is pronounced, ah, while in Danish,

119
00:07:09.041 --> 00:07:12.010
it's pronounced a and in Norwegian,

120
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.130
the G is pronounced as good while in Danish,

121
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:20.020
a final G like this is silent or an approximate. That's almost silent,

122
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:24.370
like a slight sound, another sentence,

123
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.820
meaning they like to drive fast cars in Norwegian

124
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.000
[inaudible] and in Danish,

125
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.370
[inaudible] first noticed the different ways of expressing like in the two

126
00:07:36.371 --> 00:07:40.750
languages in Norwegian there's li in Danish,

127
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.640
like is expressed with the phrase, why does it include Kuna?

128
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:50.440
Which means can, or able to, well, even though now the whole phrase just means,

129
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.490
like, it originated with the meaning of able to bear something,

130
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.900
meaning you're able to handle it or deal with it. Like it's not too bad.

131
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:04.210
Next notice the different form of the infinitive particle like two in English

132
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.570
and notice the different spelling and pronunciation of the verb,

133
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.590
meaning to drive.

134
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:12.910
<v 1>Okay.</v>

135
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.590
<v 0>Next we see different adjectives,</v>

136
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:19.180
meaning fast in Norwegian and in Danish hoodie.

137
00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:20.853
<v 1>The word.</v>

138
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:22.990
<v 0>Does exist in Danish,</v>

139
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.320
but it's very old fashioned to use it with the meaning of fast,

140
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.200
but it's still often used with the meaning of healthy,

141
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:34.180
who also exists in Norwegian as a synonym of Rusk.

142
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:36.543
Another sentence,

143
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:40.630
meaning crime is increasing due to high unemployment in Norwegian

144
00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.400
[inaudible] and in Danish.

145
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.790
[inaudible] the main difference in this pair of sentences is a difference in

146
00:08:51.791 --> 00:08:55.000
vocabulary preference. For example, these words,

147
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.440
which are the present tense forms of the verbs, meaning to increase,

148
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.240
there is a cognate of.

149
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:05.690
<v 1>Yeah. In Danish ish, but the usual word would be steer.</v>

150
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.640
And there's a cognitive.

151
00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.770
<v 0>Steer in Norwegian. Steve.</v>

152
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:11.803
<v 1>Steve.</v>

153
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:14.630
<v 0>See basically the same phrase,</v>

154
00:09:14.631 --> 00:09:19.370
meaning due to literally on ground of ground as in reason.

155
00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.180
But there's a difference in pronunciation between these words here.

156
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:28.120
<v 1>Region Gideon and in Danish in the North.</v>

157
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:32.300
<v 0>Region where the U represents an oo sound. But in Danish, the,</v>

158
00:09:32.301 --> 00:09:36.890
you can be pronounced differently after the uvular are more like all.

159
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:40.040
And while the Norwegian word ends in a long continent,

160
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:44.900
the Danish word ends in followed by a glottal stop or creaky voice.

161
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:50.060
The D is silent after N in this word, the F is silent.

162
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.290
And at the end of the Danish word for unemployment, there's a soft D.

163
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.810
<v 1>Let's examine.</v>

164
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.550
<v 0>One final pair of sentences.</v>

165
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:03.200
These sentences mean falling in love is common among young people in Norwegian

166
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:07.070
flooded out of all liberal and in Danish.

167
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.850
<v 1>[Inaudible] in this lab.</v>

168
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.470
<v 0>Per of sentences. Again,</v>

169
00:10:12.471 --> 00:10:16.250
we see the same sentence structure with some different vocabulary preference,

170
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.930
the words for common or different notice, the different spellings of the words,

171
00:10:20.931 --> 00:10:21.764
meaning.

172
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.720
<v 1>Mung plum plant.</v>

173
00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:24.830
<v 0>And again,</v>

174
00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:29.090
D is silent after N so we don't really hear a difference in the continents here.

175
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:34.130
The main difference here is in the quality of the a vowel notice that the terms

176
00:10:34.131 --> 00:10:35.900
for young people are somewhat different.

177
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.060
There is a word for young people in Danish.

178
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:41.420
That's more similar to the Norwegian. One Udon though,

179
00:10:41.421 --> 00:10:43.490
that word is pretty old fashioned in Danish.

180
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.380
<v 1>As you.</v>

181
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.800
<v 0>Can see, Norwegian and Danish are very similar on paper,</v>

182
00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.170
but end up sounding quite different when they're spoken.

183
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.320
They're different enough to be considered different languages,

184
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.830
but they're close enough that speakers of either language can read the other one

185
00:10:57.831 --> 00:10:58.880
without much trouble.

186
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:02.720
It seems to me that speakers of either language could learn to understand the

187
00:11:02.721 --> 00:11:03.201
other one,

188
00:11:03.201 --> 00:11:06.890
as it's naturally spoken by learning the features of the other languages,

189
00:11:06.891 --> 00:11:10.250
phonology, and then getting lots of exposure to it. Indeed,

190
00:11:10.251 --> 00:11:14.120
people who move from one country to the other do just that and also learn to

191
00:11:14.121 --> 00:11:17.450
make their own speech more intelligible to speakers of the other language,

192
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.770
by speaking, more clearly or more slowly, but a lot of Norwegians and Danes,

193
00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.280
as well as Swedes tell me that they just speak English with each other instead.

194
00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.060
And that brings me to the question of the day to speakers of Norwegian and

195
00:11:29.061 --> 00:11:31.550
Danish and Swedes, too. If you want to jump in,

196
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.820
do you think learning to understand each other and communicate in your

197
00:11:34.821 --> 00:11:37.190
respective languages is a useful skill,

198
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:41.180
or do you think it's better to simply use English as many people do and other

199
00:11:41.181 --> 00:11:44.690
people, what do you think about the differences between Danish and boot mall?

200
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.510
Do they genuinely seem like different languages to you?

201
00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.770
If you're excited to learn more Norwegian or Danish, then check out Lang

202
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.130
focused.com/class or Lang focused.com/danish class.

203
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.420
Innovative language courses are among the most popular online courses in the

204
00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:02.830
world. And for good reason,

205
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:07.390
they are very extensive courses with literally hundreds of lessons for learners

206
00:12:07.391 --> 00:12:11.680
of any level. Their core feature is podcast style, audio lessons,

207
00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:15.130
which is great for people who like to learn using audio materials.

208
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.000
And for people who want to learn on the go, I'm a member of several class,

209
00:12:19.001 --> 00:12:20.830
one Oh one and pod one Oh one courses.

210
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.490
And I use them to improve my listening comprehension and to improve my

211
00:12:24.491 --> 00:12:27.610
pronunciation through shadowing, the dialogues and monologues,

212
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:31.720
but class one Oh one and pod one Oh one courses offer more than just audio

213
00:12:31.721 --> 00:12:32.500
lessons.

214
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.640
They also have lots of video lessons and excellent tools like downloadable

215
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.360
transcripts and lesson notes, spaced repetition, flashcards,

216
00:12:40.361 --> 00:12:44.710
and quizzes features like these help you to review and solidify what you learn

217
00:12:44.711 --> 00:12:48.190
in each lesson so that you keep building upon what you've learned and create a

218
00:12:48.191 --> 00:12:52.570
strong foundation in the language class one Oh one and pod one-on-one lessons

219
00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:55.480
are compact and easy to complete in a single sitting,

220
00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:58.990
but don't just move on to the next lesson and forget about the previous one.

221
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.230
The review tools are there to help solidify what you've learned.

222
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:05.860
It would be a mistake to breeze through all the lessons too quickly without

223
00:13:05.861 --> 00:13:07.930
using all of those extra review features.

224
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.890
I've never learned a language using only an innovative language course,

225
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.080
but I'm a member of several of their sites.

226
00:13:14.081 --> 00:13:18.910
And I regularly use them as part of my study program. Lots of content is free,

227
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:22.600
including all new lessons, which are free for the first couple of weeks.

228
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:25.480
And then if you want access to all the archived content,

229
00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:27.280
you can upgrade to a paid account.

230
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.520
I really recommend you check out innovative language courses,

231
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.180
whether for Norwegian Danish or one of 32 other languages,

232
00:13:34.181 --> 00:13:37.930
they offer click the link in the description to get a free lifetime account.

233
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:43.420
I also want to give a big shout out to all the Lang focus, Patrion supporters,
