<v 0>This video is brought to you by Portuguese pod one Oh one.</v>

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.130
If you've always wanted to learn Portuguese,

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.050
there's no better time than right now.

4
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.750
And you can make it happen with Portuguese pod one Oh one,

6
00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:19.020
everyone. Welcome to the Lang focus channel. And my name is Paul. Today.

7
00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:23.100
We're going to focus on the two major varieties of Portuguese,

8
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.340
real Portuguese and fake Portuguese.

9
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.030
Now speakers of both varieties love me because they're sure I just called the

10
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:30.930
other one fake

11
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.190
while still being varieties of the same language.

12
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.970
The Portuguese spoken in Brazil and the Portuguese spoken in Portugal are

13
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:41.670
significantly different in terms of pronunciation,

14
00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:46.380
vocabulary and grammar Brazilians often say it's difficult to understand

15
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:50.130
Portuguese people and Portuguese people often say that Brazilians speak

16
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.080
incorrect or broken Portuguese.

17
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.260
<v 1>[Inaudible] what is United to shell? North call returned.</v>

18
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.330
She [inaudible] centrally drop, uh,

[inaudible] DVD then traditional cash.

20
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.020
<v 2>Brasilia capital. Whereas you</v>

21
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.220
[inaudible] [inaudible]

22
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.310
[inaudible] [inaudible]

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.660
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] but as

24
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.363
[inaudible].

25
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.980
<v 0>The samples you just heard were up the Brazilians say accent of Brasilia and the</v>

26
00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:47.660
accent of Lisbon Portugal.

27
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.420
There's a lot of variation within each country as well,

28
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.170
but these two accents are more or less representative of the main differences

29
00:01:54.171 --> 00:01:56.900
between European Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese.

30
00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.940
Even if you don't know any Portuguese,

31
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.880
you may have noticed that something was different about the way the two

32
00:02:01.881 --> 00:02:05.900
varieties were pronounced. European Portuguese is stress timed.

33
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.310
At least to a large extent,

34
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.900
I talked about European Portuguese being a stress timed language in my video

35
00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:16.490
explaining why Portuguese and Russian sound similar in the stress time language.

36
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.200
The length of time between stressed syllables remains relatively consistent in

37
00:02:21.201 --> 00:02:25.010
order to fit into that relatively fixed interval between stress syllables,

38
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.530
unstressed syllables tend to become shorter.

39
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.460
That results in lots of vowel reduction. In contrast,

40
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.510
Brazilian Portuguese is syllable timed in syllable timed languages.

41
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.900
Each syllable lasts for a more or less equal duration of time.

42
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.370
Lots of vowels that are reduced or dropped in European Portuguese are generally

43
00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:47.270
pronounced more fully and clearly in Brazilian Portuguese. For example,

44
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.180
this word meaning excellent in European Portuguese.

45
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.320
<v 1>Splints splint, and then Brazilian Portuguese.</v>

46
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.200
<v 2>Is it Lynch? Is it Lynch.</v>

47
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.910
<v 1>Slipped? Another major.</v>

48
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.470
<v 0>Difference in pronunciation involves the L sound in either language at the end</v>

49
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:09.580
of a word or a syllable in European Portuguese it's Oh, or, Oh,

50
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.780
like a dark L sound in Brazilian Portuguese. It's like a whoosh,

51
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.340
like a w sound after a vowel. For example, the word for a couple.

52
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.920
<v 1>Because the.</v>

53
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.660
<v 0>Sound represented by the letter S is also different in some contexts in European</v>

54
00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:28.300
Portuguese it's HSA before a voiceless consonant,

55
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.530
even if it's in the following word and before a pause, in other words,

56
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:33.580
at the end of a word,

57
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:37.930
if there's nothing right after it in most Brazilian accents it's before a

58
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:41.200
voiceless consonant and before a pause, for example,

59
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.610
the phrase meaning pretty good.

60
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.410
<v 1>Okay.</v>

61
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.100
<v 0>Note that in some Brazilian accent, such as the Carioca accent,</v>

62
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.840
the European sound is used before a voiced consonant in European

63
00:03:54.841 --> 00:03:59.640
Portuguese. It's in Brazilian Portuguese it's in most accents,

64
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.350
for example, the word meanings.

65
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.780
<v 1>Miserable, miserable.</v>

66
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.840
<v 0>Note that between vowels it's Zed in both European and Brazilian accent,</v>

67
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.820
we saw this before in the word.

68
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.390
<v 1>Cause the.</v>

69
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.820
<v 0>Sound also differs between the two countries,</v>

70
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.920
depending on the context it appears in.

71
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.520
There's plenty of variation of the R sound within each country too.

72
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.570
But I'll try to give the general tendencies when at the beginning of a word or

73
00:04:27.571 --> 00:04:29.430
doubled in European Portuguese,

74
00:04:29.431 --> 00:04:34.410
it's similar to a French or German R while in Brazilian Portuguese

75
00:04:34.411 --> 00:04:38.280
it's huh? Huh? Or hot, for example.

76
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:41.250
<v 1>At the end.</v>

77
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.911
<v 0>Of a syllable,</v>

78
00:04:41.911 --> 00:04:45.660
it's the same as above in Brazilian Portuguese in European Portuguese,

79
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.350
it's normally an alveolar tap, for example.

80
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.400
<v 1>Nope.</v>

81
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.280
<v 0>Between vowels or after a continent, but before a vowel,</v>

82
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.380
it's an alveolar tap in both varieties.

83
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.023
<v 1>Another character.</v>

84
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.710
<v 0>Difference is the pronunciation of D followed by I in Portugal.</v>

85
00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:10.740
It's pronounced D or the usually when,

86
00:05:10.741 --> 00:05:15.600
between vowels in Brazilian Portuguese it's G for example, the word for D.

87
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.290
<v 1>Gee, there's a parallel.</v>

88
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.160
<v 0>Difference in the pronunciation of tea followed by I in Portugal.</v>

89
00:05:23.161 --> 00:05:27.630
It's T though the vowel may be reduced and unstressed syllables in Brazil.

90
00:05:27.631 --> 00:05:30.540
It's cheap. For example, the word for ant.

91
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.430
<v 1>Yeah. She, uh.</v>

92
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.200
<v 0>Sounds ju and cha result from palatalization.</v>

93
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.300
Palatalization also occurs in D E N T E when they're unstressed with no

94
00:05:42.301 --> 00:05:44.760
accent Mark. And when they're followed by a,

95
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.280
in the next syllable that's because in those cases,

96
00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:50.700
the letter E actually sounds like the letter. I, for example.

97
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.980
<v 1>Nope.</v>

98
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.730
<v 0>And in some areas such as the Northeast of Brazil, this doesn't occur.</v>

99
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.740
The Portuguese varieties of Portugal and Brazil share the vast majority of their

100
00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:04.550
vocabulary,

101
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.790
but just like British people and North American people use some different

102
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:10.430
vocabulary. So do people from Portugal and Brazil,

103
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.180
the words for Trane in European, Portuguese it's kumbaya,

104
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.980
but in Brazilian Portuguese it's, which comes from the English word trend.

105
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:20.600
The words for bus,

106
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.580
The words for catching a lift or hitching a ride.

107
00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.680
<v 1>Player got on it.</v>

108
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.430
<v 0>The words for bathroom in Portugal it's caused by which means how self</v>

109
00:06:33.431 --> 00:06:38.230
bathing, but in Brazil, it's interestingly in Portugal,

110
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.830
this word actually means lifeguard. The words for toilet.

111
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.620
<v 1>[Inaudible] the words for fruit juice Sumo.</v>

112
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.870
So breakfast almost this means little lunch

113
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:54.993
[inaudible] this means.

114
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.550
<v 0>Morning coffee, refrigerator.</v>

115
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.030
<v 1>Jayla data in Brazilian Portuguese [inaudible] is used with.</v>

116
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.170
<v 0>The meaning of meat processing plant.</v>

117
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.580
I imagine it was originally used to refer to a cold storage facility for meat.

118
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.070
Let's look at a sentence for a second.

119
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.980
There is milk and juice in the fridge in Portugal,

120
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.350
a lady swimmer and in Brazil.

121
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.350
<v 1>[Inaudible] data in both.</v>

122
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.480
<v 0>Varieties, word for word it's. There is milk and juice in the fridge.</v>

123
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.610
Aside from the different vocabulary,

124
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.130
notice the different pronunciation of the word, familiar.

125
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.100
<v 1>Talk late Legion again.</v>

126
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.500
<v 0>And we hear the difference in how tee is pronounced.</v>

127
00:07:35.501 --> 00:07:38.380
When unstressed the words for cell phones.

128
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.110
<v 1>Kelly, Morville Sila.</v>

129
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:46.080
<v 0>The words for screen, meaning the screen of a TV or computer in Portugal.</v>

130
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.110
It's [inaudible], which comes from French eCom in Brazil. It's Dayla

131
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.110
 this word also occurs in European Portuguese, but it's

132
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.110
 used for other types of screens or canvases

133
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.110
, not screens on electronic devices. The words for three piece suit are different. The meaning of 

134
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.110
three-piece

135
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.110
 suit is unique to Brazilian Portuguese, but this word exists in Portuguese, in general, with the meaning of trio or set of three, there 

136
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.110
are

137
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.110
 quite a few words like that that have different meanings in either country. Sometimes their primary meaning is different, and sometimes there's an additional meaning that doesn't exist in the other country. 

138
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.943
Kimmy's Zola in Portugal. This means t-shirt or sweater.

139
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.160
<v 1>Gummies Zola in Brazil. It.</v>

140
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.020
<v 0>Means nightgown or night dress.</v>

141
00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.920
Some of these words can be a little dangerous in Portugal.

142
00:08:32.921 --> 00:08:36.100
This means boy in Brazil,

143
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.940
one meaning is to be really angry. And another meaning is well,

144
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.380
a male prostitute. Similarly in Portugal,

145
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:45.370
this means a young.

146
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.710
<v 1>Lady, how by the IGA in Brazil.</v>

147
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:51.940
<v 0>This means a female prostitute for the meaning of a young lady in Brazilian</v>

148
00:08:51.941 --> 00:08:54.760
Portuguese. The word meaning can be used

149
00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:01.200
in Portugal. This means university tuition fee, but it will be in Brazil.

150
00:09:01.201 --> 00:09:02.400
It means a bribe.

151
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.750
There are a few differences in grammar between European and Brazilian

152
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:09.540
Portuguese, second person, singular pronouns,

153
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.370
European Portuguese uses to as the familiar second person, singular pronoun,

154
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.440
and Vasa as the informal,

155
00:09:16.441 --> 00:09:21.000
but unfamiliar form used with people of similar age or status who you don't know

156
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:25.980
very well. Brazilian Portuguese uses, we'll say as the informal second person,

157
00:09:25.981 --> 00:09:28.620
singular pronoun, both familiar and unfamiliar.

158
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.770
This is true in the standard form of Brazilian Portuguese.

159
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:36.480
And in many dialects though, some dialects retain two. For example,

160
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:40.740
you sing well in European Portuguese, and in Brazilian.

161
00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.273
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

162
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.770
<v 0>Kind of pronoun mixing often takes place in Brazilian Portuguese with VOSA being</v>

163
00:09:48.771 --> 00:09:53.420
used as the subject pronoun together with the equivalent of two as the object

164
00:09:53.421 --> 00:09:57.500
pronoun or the possessive. For example, for the phrase you and your son,

165
00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:58.340
you might.

166
00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.930
<v 1>Here, this will say, they'll feel rather than this. We'll say, however, it,</v>

167
00:10:02.931 --> 00:10:03.980
both of them are used.

168
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.590
<v 0>The dialects of Brazilian Portuguese that do use to the conjugation for VSA,</v>

169
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:13.220
which is really a third person, singular conjugation is often used.

170
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.170
So again, this is a kind of mixed form that only occurs in Brazil,

171
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:22.700
placement of object, pronouns, object pronouns in Portuguese,

172
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:26.000
or normally critics that attach themselves close to the verb.

173
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.110
There are sometimes positioned differently in the two varieties in European

174
00:10:30.111 --> 00:10:34.910
Portuguese. They're often in-clinic placed after the verb. And in some cases,

175
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:38.780
our Mayo clinic in the middle of the verb in Brazilian Portuguese,

176
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:41.810
they are generally pro clinic meaning before the verb,

177
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.800
except in compound tenses in which they come after the auxiliary verb.

178
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.620
And before the main verb, for example, a sentence,

179
00:10:48.621 --> 00:10:53.210
meaning he saw me in European Portuguese and in Brazilian Portuguese.

180
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:55.460
<v 1>In European.</v>

181
00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.720
<v 0>Portuguese Mayo clinic object pronouns are used in the future indicative tents</v>

182
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.090
and the conditional in Brazilian Portuguese.

183
00:11:02.091 --> 00:11:06.230
This is considered archaic and it's rarely used for example, the sentence,

184
00:11:06.231 --> 00:11:08.870
meaning I would help you in European Portuguese

185
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:11.750
and in Brazilian Portuguese.

186
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:14.030
<v 1>Notice how the.</v>

187
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:18.320
<v 0>Object pronoun in European Portuguese is placed right between the verb STEM and</v>

188
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:22.010
its inflectional ending though. This is a formal and literary form,

189
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.170
continuous forms,

190
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:28.670
continuous verb forms like the present continuous are formed differently in

191
00:11:28.671 --> 00:11:33.470
Brazilian Portuguese it's is the plus the Gerand, but in European Portuguese,

192
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.130
it's formed with [inaudible] plus plus the infinitive.

193
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.880
So take the phrase for I'm speaking in Brazilian Portuguese.

194
00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:44.990
<v 1>And in European Portuguese it's [inaudible].</v>

195
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:48.590
<v 0>From what I understand, this is one difference that really, really,</v>

196
00:11:48.591 --> 00:11:52.700
really annoys Portuguese speakers from Portugal who insists that it's terribly

197
00:11:52.701 --> 00:11:54.070
incorrect. Portuguese is.

198
00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:58.830
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

199
00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:02.610
<v 0>Take the sentence. We are learning Portuguese, but it's difficult. Thumbs up.</v>

200
00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:07.830
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

201
00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:08.280
<v 0>First.</v>

202
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.670
You can see the difference in the present continuous tense that we talked about

203
00:12:11.671 --> 00:12:16.140
a moment ago, thumbs up, thumbs up in the end. Aside from that,

204
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.710
these sentences are pretty much the same except for their pronunciation

205
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:22.980
is the most in this word,

206
00:12:22.981 --> 00:12:26.100
you can hear the difference in the S sounds sure in European,

207
00:12:26.101 --> 00:12:28.770
Portuguese and SU in Brazilian Portuguese,

208
00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:32.760
you can also hear the vowel reduction in the European word with the first vowel,

209
00:12:32.761 --> 00:12:36.980
basically dropped and notice this word [inaudible]

210
00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:39.001
in this word,

211
00:12:39.001 --> 00:12:43.050
you can hear the Brazilian G sound at the beginning while in the European word

212
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:47.730
it's D you can also hear the Brazilian L as it's pronounced at the end of a word

213
00:12:47.731 --> 00:12:50.940
or a syllable like w European,

214
00:12:50.941 --> 00:12:55.350
Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese are clearly varieties of the same language.

215
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.130
And in terms of grammar and vocabulary, they are the same for the most part.

216
00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:00.720
But as you saw earlier,

217
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.930
there are some differences that really stand out when you encounter them,

218
00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.500
especially words that have different meanings in either variety,

219
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.670
but the biggest difference lies in the phonology of the two varieties or their

220
00:13:11.671 --> 00:13:13.080
systems of pronunciation.

221
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:16.890
That's probably the thing that often makes it difficult for speakers of one

222
00:13:16.891 --> 00:13:18.480
variety to understand the other,

223
00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:22.200
but that difference can be overcome by learning about what's different between

224
00:13:22.201 --> 00:13:25.170
the two varieties and gaining exposure to the other one.

225
00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:27.870
But that's just how it seems to me. What do I know?

226
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.120
Let's ask native speakers of Portuguese,

227
00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:34.020
the question of the day for native speakers of European and Brazilian

228
00:13:34.021 --> 00:13:34.830
Portuguese,

229
00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:38.490
how easy is it for you to understand and communicate with speakers of the other

230
00:13:38.491 --> 00:13:40.140
variety and other people?

231
00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:43.230
What do you think of the differences between the two varieties?

232
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:44.940
How major do they seem to you?

233
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:49.680
I know some of the people watching this video already know Portuguese and others

234
00:13:49.681 --> 00:13:51.240
wish they knew Portuguese better,

235
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.450
but isn't it time to stop wishing and actually make it happen.

236
00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:58.650
