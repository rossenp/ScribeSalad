00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.570
Click the link in the description. Hello, set of rules.

6
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.970
Welcome to the line and focus channel. And my name is Paul. Today.

7
00:00:19.971 --> 00:00:24.650
We're going to compare standard German and Bavarian a German dialect.

8
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.520
That's so different from standard German that most other German speakers find it

9
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.840
difficult to understand.

10
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.800
Bavarian is spoken in the state of Bavaria in Southeastern Germany,

11
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.180
as well as in most of Austria and South tea role it's elite because it includes

12
00:00:38.181 --> 00:00:42.110
most speakers in Austria. You may hear it referred to as Ostrow Bavarian,

13
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.480
it's a group of upper German dialect or all by Deutsche while standard German

14
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.090
is based largely on central German dialects.

15
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.290
There are differences in all aspects of the language, including pronunciation,

16
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.750
vocabulary, and grammar, but of course,

17
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.510
Bavarian speakers can also speak standard German,

18
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.250
but with their own characteristic,

19
00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:06.230
Bavarian accent Bavarian is spoken along a sliding scale with standard German

20
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.500
and its speakers mix it with varying degrees of standard German,

21
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.040
depending on the situation and social context. For example,

22
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.640
they may speak full on Bavarian with their family and close friends,

23
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.080
standard German with some dialectal elements with acquaintances and standard

24
00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:22.250
German at a business meeting.

25
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.960
This sliding scale between Bavarian and standard German is sometimes compared to

26
00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:29.840
the one between Scotts and standard English in Scotland.

27
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.900
It's also worth noting that in large cities like Munich,

28
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.650
there are many people who move there from other parts of Germany and from around

29
00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:37.220
the world.

30
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.240
So the speech there is normally closer to standard German Bavarian can be

31
00:01:41.241 --> 00:01:43.280
further broken down into three groups,

32
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.030
Northern Bavarian central Bavarian and Southern Bavarian.

33
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.920
It has no standard form or standardized spelling. And across these three groups,

34
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.220
there are numerous local varieties that somewhat differ from each other.

35
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.530
So in order to compare with standard German,

36
00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.720
we'll focus on one particular variety.

37
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.620
The dialect [inaudible] spoken in upper Bavaria,

38
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.180
near Munich because Bavarian differs from one area to another and people mix it

39
00:02:08.181 --> 00:02:11.930
with standard German to varying degrees. Some people may say, Hey,

40
00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:13.670
I don't say it that way. Or, Hey,

41
00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:18.380
I say it both ways that's to be expected because people use nonstandard dialects

42
00:02:18.381 --> 00:02:19.280
in different ways,

43
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.360
but hopefully these examples will give you a general idea of how Bavarian

44
00:02:23.361 --> 00:02:27.050
differs from standard German pronunciation are,

45
00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:28.790
is often trilled in Bavarian.

46
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.510
Whereas it's normally a uvular fricative in German, for example,

47
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.040
a word for rain in standard German and in Bavarian

48
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.340
also notice what happens to the G sound,

49
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.140
the evil after the G is reduced or basically dropped and G becomes

50
00:02:45.141 --> 00:02:49.220
nasalized since it comes before. And so it's pronounced no,

51
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.080
but the biggest difference in Bavarian is it's vowels. For example, ah,

52
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.600
becomes Oh, in standard German,

53
00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.830
meaning roof becomes dolls.

54
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.190
Meaning water becomes.

55
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.370
<v 1>Especially distinctive.</v>

56
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.080
<v 0>Is Bavarians diphthongs.</v>

57
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.800
It has different diphthongs from standard German and more diphthongs than

58
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:12.634
standard German.

59
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.590
I in standard German often corresponds to UWA in Bavarian

60
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.590
meaning journey becomes.

61
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.350
<v 1>Highest.</v>

62
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.550
<v 0>Meaning hot becomes who S Ooh or</v>

63
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.320
often corresponds to UWA the word for good in standard German

64
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.910
and in Bavarian. And the word for must.

65
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.070
<v 1>MUAs E.</v>

66
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.400
<v 0>Spelled with E often corresponds to ER,</v>

67
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.340
ni meaning never becomes

68
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.080
meaning gets becomes correct.

69
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.600
I'll often corresponds to oil height, meaning stop becomes

70
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.490
meaning so or thus becomes

71
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.690
meaning once becomes.

72
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.750
<v 1>Ill.</v>

73
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.730
<v 0>Often corresponds to oui, meaning example becomes</v>

74
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.130
spirit, meaning played, becomes exploited,

75
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.110
and there are other sound changes that result in we as well, like Shula,

76
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.870
which means school becomes Sui.

77
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.270
<v 1>Other sound changes.</v>

78
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.370
<v 0>Unstressed eat tends to be highly reduced or dropped meaning</v>

79
00:04:35.371 --> 00:04:37.710
to forget becomes Ferguson,

80
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.400
Ben or boon at the end of words, tends to become, mm, with an M.

81
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.120
The word for screws becomes

82
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.570
then or an N at the end of words, corresponds with not in Bavarian,

83
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.760
there's this word meaning to mean or to think mine. And when I,

84
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.280
and notice that once again, we see the correspondence of the sounds I, and UWA,

85
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.410
you've probably noticed that Bavarian is normally spelled to reflect how it's

86
00:05:10.411 --> 00:05:14.370
pronounced though its spelling isn't standardized. For example, ER,

87
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.030
and standard German is often pronounced as a vowel without an R sound,

88
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.470
not only in Bavarian, but colloquial standard German as well in Bavarian,

89
00:05:22.471 --> 00:05:25.140
it's normally spelled with an a for example,

90
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.000
meaning master and Westa. And one more example,

91
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.000
I've been meaning to connect and

92
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.340
vocabulary. Some very basic words are different in Bavarian.

93
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.490
Even if they come from the same root as the standard German words,

94
00:05:41.491 --> 00:05:42.990
they often have different forms.

95
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.450
You may have noticed at the beginning of the video,

96
00:05:45.451 --> 00:05:47.820
that the words for hello are different. Hello.

97
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.500
<v 1>Say the word for I E.</v>

98
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.730
<v 0>Indefinite article in its masculine nominative singular form.</v>

99
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.640
Ah, the word for you in the singular dish.

100
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.680
Let's look at a sentence. When you see and hear the sentences in this section,

101
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.020
you'll probably notice a lot of little changes.

102
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:12.140
Like the ones we looked at in the previous section on pronunciation,

103
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.980
these sentences mean I have a present for you in standard German

104
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.010
[inaudible] and in Bavarian.

105
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:21.470
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

106
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.400
<v 0>Here. Notice the difference in the subject pronoun we just saw and notice the</v>

107
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:26.780
different vowels in the verbs,

108
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:30.560
meaning have the indefinite article is different as we saw above.

109
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.460
And the word for present loses its short evil in Bavarian,

110
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.510
or at least it's really reduced the preposition meaning for it takes a different

111
00:06:38.511 --> 00:06:41.990
form and the personal pronoun, meaning you takes a different form.

112
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.160
As we saw above the word for me in the date of case,

113
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.550
ma the word for is,

114
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.750
is the word for also, ah,

115
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.760
and now a pair of sentences,

116
00:06:55.761 --> 00:06:59.570
meaning he told me it's his birthday today too in standard German

117
00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:03.770
[inaudible] and in Bavarian.

118
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:07.540
<v 2>Yeah. So [inaudible] does height. I, you put stock is.</v>

119
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.450
<v 0>Here. We see the different form of the first person,</v>

120
00:07:10.451 --> 00:07:14.890
singular data of personal pronoun. In other words, me in the date of case here,

121
00:07:14.891 --> 00:07:16.660
we see the different word for also,

122
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.410
and here we see the difference in the third person, singular form of the verb,

123
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.250
meaning to be meaning is in English and looking at the other words,

124
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.850
you'll notice some differences in pronunciation and word form that we looked at

125
00:07:27.851 --> 00:07:28.684
earlier.

126
00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.470
It seems that the speaker of the Bavarian sentence actually said this in the

127
00:07:32.471 --> 00:07:35.710
present tense, not the past tense as some of you may have noticed,

128
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.890
but that's okay because we're focusing on vocabulary at the moment.

129
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:43.150
Sometimes not just different forms, but completely different words are used.

130
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.690
These sentences mean it's hot today. Isn't it in standard German

131
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.713
and in Bavarian.

132
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.020
<v 2>Is who has hired Natewa.</v>

133
00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.990
<v 0>Here. We see a Bavarian version of the phrase,</v>

134
00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:01.960
but an alternate word can be used instead gal or gay depending on the

135
00:08:01.961 --> 00:08:05.290
area. It simply means isn't it? Yes.

136
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.870
The weather is strange this year in standard German.

137
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:11.523
And in Bavaria.

138
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.950
<v 2>Yo, this Veda is higher set. Some.</v>

139
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.420
<v 0>Notice that the standard German phrase, meaning this year is Jesus. Yeah.</v>

140
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.240
While Bavarian has a different word higher,

141
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.890
this word cite Psalm could also be selled some here.

142
00:08:26.891 --> 00:08:29.710
We see that in Bavarian, the S is voiceless.

143
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.500
It's not pronounced Z as in standard German

144
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:38.980
in standard German. The words for up or upward are meaning up there,

145
00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:43.720
away from your current position and meaning up here towards your

146
00:08:43.721 --> 00:08:46.570
current position in Bavarian, the preferred words are.

147
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.320
<v 2>I'll see, and I'll fit alpha.</v>

148
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.820
<v 0>There are also cases in which both words are used in standard German. And,</v>

149
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.950
but there's a preference or tendency to use one word more than the other.

150
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.630
For example, in Bavarian,

151
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.740
there's a tendency to use the word meaning talk more than

152
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:10.770
meaning speak. Another example of that is the word for throw in standard German.

153
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.370
The more common way is while in Bavarian it's

154
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.980
grammar standard German has for grammatical cases,

155
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.980
nominative accusative, genitive and dative.

156
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.330
Bavarian has no genitive case. Possession is shown in different ways.

157
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.890
For example, take the phrase,

158
00:09:28.891 --> 00:09:33.780
meaning the man's house in standard German house here,

159
00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:36.150
we see that the noun phrases in the genitive form,

160
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:39.690
this definite article is in the masculine singular genitive form.

161
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:44.340
And the noun has the masculine genitive singular case ending in Bavarian.

162
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.860
One way to say this is using fun, which means.

163
00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.340
<v 2>This house for more.</v>

164
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.680
<v 0>[Inaudible] is a contraction of fun and dam the masculine singular data of</v>

165
00:09:54.681 --> 00:09:55.580
definite article.

166
00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:00.170
So this is like saying the house of the man another way is to simply use the

167
00:10:00.171 --> 00:10:00.380
date.

168
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.600
<v 2>Of case did more say house.</v>

169
00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.690
<v 0>The definite article and the noun are in the date of here.</v>

170
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.690
And then it's followed by the possessive pronoun sign.

171
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.420
This is like saying to the man his house.

172
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:15.410
Another difference involved as a verb tenses in Bavarian,

173
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:19.310
the past tense is not used. The perfect tense is used. Instead.

174
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:24.260
These sentences mean I laughed in standard German and in

175
00:10:24.261 --> 00:10:28.190
Bavarian, he lost literally I have laughed.

176
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:31.850
There are two exceptions that verb sine meaning to be,

177
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:36.800
and the verb Volin meaning want another difference is that in

178
00:10:36.801 --> 00:10:38.690
Bavarian, there are double negatives,

179
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.760
which don't really occur in standard German.

180
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:44.540
At least not double negatives like this, which result in a negative meaning.

181
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.740
Here's the sentence. Meaning I have never heard that before in standard German

182
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:55.130
word for word it's that have I yet never heard in Bavaria?

183
00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.023
<v 2>[Inaudible] word for it.</v>

184
00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.840
<v 0>That's have I yet never not heard again.</v>

185
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:06.800
Notice that the double negative results in a negative meaning not a positive

186
00:11:06.801 --> 00:11:10.460
meaning. There are even some triple negatives in Bavarian.

187
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.180
These sentences mean because no one has any money, actually.

188
00:11:14.181 --> 00:11:18.140
They're not full sentences. They're clauses, but here we go. And standard German

189
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:24.350
word for word it's because nobody money has and in Bavarian, right?

190
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:27.380
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

191
00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:32.360
<v 0>For what it's because nobody no money not has. Hmm. In English.</v>

192
00:11:32.361 --> 00:11:35.570
That's kind of like saying, because nobody ain't got no money,

193
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:39.440
which is possible in dialectal, English in middle high German,

194
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:40.910
double negatives were normal,

195
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.810
but variant seems to maintain more features of middle high German than standard

196
00:11:44.811 --> 00:11:45.644
German does.

197
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.970
Now that we've looked at some of the differences between Bavarian and standard

198
00:11:49.971 --> 00:11:50.390
German,

199
00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:54.400
let's look at a couple more pairs of sentences and see what we find these

200
00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:58.780
sentences mean. When I arrived, they hadn't eaten yet in standard German.

201
00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:02.160
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

202
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.440
<v 0>For word it's. When I arrived,</v>

203
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:07.270
had they yet nothing eaten in.

204
00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:11.400
<v 3>As you all come up in [inaudible].</v>

205
00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.610
<v 0>Word for word it's similar, but there's something different here,</v>

206
00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.080
which we'll come back to in a minute.

207
00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:20.580
First in the word for when we see one of the pronunciation differences we

208
00:12:20.581 --> 00:12:25.050
encountered earlier isle in standard German corresponds with oil in

209
00:12:25.051 --> 00:12:29.340
Bavarian. Next we see the different subject pronouns, meaning I again,

210
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.710
or at least different forms of the same pronoun.

211
00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:35.910
Then we see that the verb meaning arrive is conjugated differently in standard

212
00:12:35.911 --> 00:12:36.330
German.

213
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:40.080
The verb is in the past tense while in Bavarian it's in the perfect tense.

214
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:43.650
So it has an auxiliary verb and this is it's past participle.

215
00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.640
The past participle would be different than standard German and get Coleman.

216
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:52.230
Next. We can see that the auxiliary verb meaning had is pronounced differently.

217
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.230
We see the correspondence of awe and all,

218
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:58.560
and we see the loss of the unstressed E in Bavarian,

219
00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:02.190
the word for yet takes a different form. Next in Bavarian,

220
00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.120
we see the word Knicks, which is common among German dialects in general,

221
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:07.170
not only Bavarian,

222
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:11.670
it seems to be a contraction of Nicks and the gain and the final word.

223
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:16.080
We see the loss of unstressed eat another pair of sentences.

224
00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:17.310
These sentences mean,

225
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.790
I think the teacher's opinion is nonsense in standard German.

226
00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.090
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

227
00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:24.690
<v 0>For word it's.</v>

228
00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:29.610
I think the opinion of the teacher is nonsense and

229
00:13:29.611 --> 00:13:30.444
in Bavarian.

230
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:34.800
<v 3>Clap denied. No familiara is modern.</v>

231
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.860
<v 0>First notice that the verb meaning think is different.</v>

232
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:42.630
Both verbs Behnken and Globen are used in both standard German and Bavarian.

233
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.180
So you could say either bank in Bavarian,

234
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.770
but globin is more common in Bavarian while banking is more common than standard

235
00:13:49.771 --> 00:13:53.880
German note that Dinkin means think while globin means believe,

236
00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.770
but they're often used interchangeably.

237
00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:59.910
Next notice the different way of showing possession in the standard German

238
00:13:59.911 --> 00:14:00.450
sentence.

239
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:04.350
This noun phrases in the genitive case with both the definite article and the

240
00:14:04.351 --> 00:14:06.810
noun in the masculine singular genitive form.

241
00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.060
Remember that Bavarian has no genitive.

242
00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:12.930
So possession is shown with fun meaning of here it's foam,

243
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.440
because it's contracted with the date of case definite article dam,

244
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.170
which is for either masculine or neutral, by the way,

245
00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:23.100
and notice that the noun doesn't have the genitive ending in Bavarian it's in

246
00:14:23.101 --> 00:14:24.960
the date of case. Finally,

247
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:29.100
here we see that the Bavarian word for nonsense is different model.

248
00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:32.190
It literally means a kind of scrambled pancake dish,

249
00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.020
which looks pretty darn delicious.

250
00:14:34.021 --> 00:14:38.460
If you ask me and the indefinite article here means that this is accountable

251
00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:39.294
now,

252
00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.860
as we've seen standard German and Bavarian differ from each other in several

253
00:14:43.861 --> 00:14:45.240
different ways, but of course,

254
00:14:45.241 --> 00:14:49.110
Bavarian dialects are not the only dialects that differ from standard German.

255
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:53.360
There are various dialects in all areas of Germany, Austria, Switzerland,

256
00:14:53.361 --> 00:14:56.720
and South tea role. Of course, everyone learns standard German,

257
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.420
which unites the speakers of all those different dialects.

258
00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:03.680
But of course they do throw some dialectal elements into their speech and speak

259
00:15:03.681 --> 00:15:06.770
with regional accents that are influenced by those dialects.

260
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:11.210
The question of the day for speakers of non Bavarian varieties of German.

261
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:15.230
How well do you understand Bavarian speakers when they're using their dialects

262
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.000
and for speakers of Bavarian?

263
00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:20.450
To what extent do you use Bavarian as opposed to standard German?

264
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.640
How does it differ depending on the situation,

265
00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.860
please leave your comments after the video,

266
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.210
if you'd like learning German or Spanish, French, or English,

267
00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.080
I recommend that you check out lingo.

268
00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:34.870
What if I told you that you could take three months of classes with qualified

269
00:15:34.871 --> 00:15:37.930
native speaking teachers and get a 100% refund,

270
00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.200
you can do exactly that with the lingo to language sprint,

271
00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:45.580
it's a challenge to you to take an online language class every day for three

272
00:15:45.581 --> 00:15:49.540
months, if you complete the challenge, you'll get a 100% refund.

273
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:54.850
Now imagine that the powerful incentive of a 100% refund pushing you to

274
00:15:54.851 --> 00:15:57.520
practice with a native speaking teacher every day,

275
00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:01.900
imagine how much you could improve by taking lessons every day for three months

276
00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:05.110
and how you would improve your time management and build the habit of

277
00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:09.100
practicing. Every day recently taken some French classes with lingo.

278
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:12.340
Now I often read the news and French and things like that,

279
00:16:12.341 --> 00:16:15.130
but I hadn't really spoken French much in a long time.

280
00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.860
So I was feeling shy and nervous to speak it again.

281
00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:22.360
But lingo to offers structured courses and structured lessons with fixed lesson

282
00:16:22.361 --> 00:16:24.640
topics and downloadable study materials,

283
00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.570
which has really made it comfortable and easy to jump back into speaking.

284
00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.960
I can preview the vocabulary and the topic before the lesson.

285
00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:35.980
So I feel confident when the lesson begins during this first few lessons,

286
00:16:35.981 --> 00:16:40.180
I've had lots of speaking opportunities and it's made me feel motivated and

287
00:16:40.181 --> 00:16:41.290
excited to continue.

288
00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.710
I really think that you'll feel excited and motivated as well. Well,

289
00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.890
the sprint starts on April 8th,

290
