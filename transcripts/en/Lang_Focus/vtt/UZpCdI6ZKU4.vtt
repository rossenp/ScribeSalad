00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.040
<v 0>Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Lang focus channel. And my name is Paul.</v>

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.390
Today. We're going to talk about African American vernacular English

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.790
African-American vernacular English,

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.770
which you may also hear referred to as Ebonics is a group of dialects of English

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.450
that developed among African-American communities in the United States because

6
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:24.450
of the expressive and innovative nature of these dialects.

7
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.750
They are very influential and they are the source of many slang,

8
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:31.200
expressions and idioms that are used in general, American English,

9
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.330
and even international English yet,

10
00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:37.440
despite the fact that English speakers borrowed their favorite pieces of AAV E

11
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.610
there's still the persistent belief that it speakers speak bad English or broken

12
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:44.730
English as though they're constantly making mistakes when they speak.

13
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.700
But any linguists will tell you, that's not how language works.

14
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.410
AAV E is not broken standard English. It's simply not standard English.

15
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.430
It's something else.

16
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.990
Enslaved African people were first brought to what is now the United States in

17
00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:00.780
16, 19, and over the next two centuries,

18
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.500
hundreds of thousands more were brought over similar to the development of

19
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.740
English based Creole languages and the Caribbean AAV.

20
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.940
He developed from contact between speakers of West African languages and their

21
00:01:11.941 --> 00:01:13.560
English speaking, slave masters,

22
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.700
as well as indentured servants from great Britain and Ireland. But while AAV,

23
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.630
he has some Creole like features it's much closer to standard English than

24
00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:22.920
Caribbean Creoles are.

25
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.760
One theory suggests that it arose as a result of the slaves learning the

26
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:31.140
dialectal English spoken by the indentured servants who were poor and oftentimes

27
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:32.880
not proficient in standard English.

28
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.420
Another theory suggests that it developed as a Creole language,

29
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.530
but then converged with standard English through a process of decriminalization.

30
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.780
The more accepted theory is the first one,

31
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.740
but there was probably also some Creole influence from the slaves brought to the

32
00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:50.850
U S from the Caribbean with black Americans living as a largely separate

33
00:01:50.851 --> 00:01:53.970
community. First under slavery. Then under segregation,

34
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.420
it makes sense that they would develop their own enduring dialects.

35
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.230
And it also makes sense that they would develop their own in-group expressions

36
00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:05.880
and idioms that were difficult for hostile outsiders to understand the great

37
00:02:05.881 --> 00:02:10.800
northward migration of the 20th century helped establish AEE as an enduring

38
00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:13.830
dialect group throughout the country. First off,

39
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.510
let me be clear that not all African-Americans speak a V E and there are some

40
00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:19.650
people who do speak it,

41
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.730
who aren't African-American and as is typically the case with non-standard

42
00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:28.380
varieties of a language AAV E exists on a continuum with standard English and

43
00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:32.580
people mix the two of them to varying degrees, depending on the situation,

44
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.300
their socioeconomic status and their perception of the dialect.

45
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.860
And it's also true that there's variation within AAV II based on region and

46
00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:41.670
generation,

47
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.930
but I'll describe some typical features that are unquestionably a part of Ave.

48
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.440
People often associate AAV with its slang,

49
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.400
especially words and expressions that have crossed over into other varieties of

50
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:57.060
English, often through music and other media words like dis,

51
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.450
which is short for disrespect, beef, meaning a conflict squash,

52
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.350
meaning to put an end to something co-sign meaning to vouch for someone,

53
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.310
give props,

54
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.060
meaning to give praise or recognition to someone and lots of other expressions

55
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:10.870
like that.

56
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.820
But this kind of slang is not representative of AAV E slang by its very nature

57
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:17.620
is always changing. The vast,

58
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:21.040
vast majority of vocabulary is standard English vocabulary,

59
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.770
even though sometimes words are used slightly differently,

60
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.300
either in form or in meaning.

61
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.870
The core of AAV is really it's grammar at its phonology.

62
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.690
Let's examine its grammar verbs.

63
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.670
There are a lot of little differences in how verbs are used first is and are are

64
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:41.350
often left out. She overdosed that's before a phrase showing location.

65
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.770
He will funny do that's before announced phrase.

66
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.040
There you go on the craze here it's left out before an adjective.

67
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.550
They're also left out before the present progressive ING.

68
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.070
<v 1>He don't know what he talking about. Note that.</v>

69
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.160
<v 0>Isn't are the only forms have to be that are dropped.</v>

70
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.050
Amma's not left out and need there all the past tense forms wasn't were more on

71
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:05.020
those later or B also isn't are,

72
00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:08.560
can't be dropped at the end of a sentence. Know what it is.

73
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.360
The basic rule is that they can only be dropped in AAV II in the same contexts

74
00:04:13.361 --> 00:04:16.270
in which they can become contractions in standard English,

75
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.790
habitual B.

76
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.320
There are contexts in which speakers of AAV used be when is, or are,

77
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:25.690
would be used in standard English. For example.

78
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.640
<v 1>We'd be working 24 seven.</v>

79
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.500
<v 0>B has a special purpose. When used like this, it indicates habitual action.</v>

80
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.660
This sentence is also possible. We work, but that just means working right now,

81
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.830
rather than habitually working over an extended period of time. Another example.

82
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.370
<v 1>He always be telling people what to do.</v>

83
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.900
<v 0>So you can see that the use of B is not a random choice or mistake.</v>

84
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.420
It's systematic and it's grammatically correct.

85
00:04:51.421 --> 00:04:56.370
According to the rules of AAV E there's also an intensive habitual marker.

86
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.760
This is similar to habitual B, but it's more emphatic.

87
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.520
<v 1>He's they running late for work.</v>

88
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.090
<v 0>This means that it happens pretty much all the time. It's habitual.</v>

89
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.630
There's also an intensified continuous marker steady.

90
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.030
It shows that the action is in progress,

91
00:05:12.031 --> 00:05:15.330
but not necessarily habitual over a longer period of time.

92
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.280
<v 1>You never listen. I've been told you to stop, but you steady plan.</v>

93
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.991
<v 0>Playing here.</v>

94
00:05:21.991 --> 00:05:26.850
I would probably say playing around or messing around lack of

95
00:05:26.851 --> 00:05:29.790
person number agreement before we saw this sentence.

96
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.340
He don't know what he talking about. This part,

97
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.370
he don't may have stood out to you as different verb.

98
00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:39.240
Conjugations are generally flattened so that they are the same regardless of

99
00:05:39.241 --> 00:05:40.170
person and number.

100
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.660
<v 1>They was acting crazy. They.</v>

101
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.690
<v 0>Was rather than they were in the present tense.</v>

102
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.740
This usually means that the third person singular form doesn't have an S.

103
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.570
<v 1>Yeah, you work at the shop down the street.</v>

104
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.280
<v 0>He work rather than he works. That's the basic pattern. Most of the time,</v>

105
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.800
a common expression that seems to contradict this rule is God's to.

106
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.270
<v 1>Okay. You Trevor, I got to go.</v>

107
00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.660
<v 0>Plus the S on gods, even when it's not in the third person,</v>

108
00:06:07.661 --> 00:06:11.950
singular God's too seems to have developed as distinct from Ghada,

109
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.340
both being contractions of how it got to God.

110
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.120
Stir is more emphatic than goddaughter, complete,

111
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.370
active or perfective done. The word done is frequently used as an aspect marker,

112
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.440
showing that an action has been completed.

113
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.360
<v 1>You know, you don't miss stuff, right?</v>

114
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.160
<v 0>This is often interpreted as referring to an action completed in the very recent</v>

115
00:06:33.161 --> 00:06:37.390
past, but that's not necessarily the case. It could be further back in the past,

116
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.560
but using done gives the feeling that the situation after the action is

117
00:06:41.561 --> 00:06:43.450
different than the situation before it.

118
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.000
<v 1>You know, woke up the whole neighborhood.</v>

119
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.660
<v 0>The word being is also used with verbs in two ways.</v>

120
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.380
One way is called unstressed bean. It's used, like have been,

121
00:06:53.381 --> 00:06:54.880
or has been in standard English.

122
00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:57.280
<v 1>She'd been married for a long time.</v>

123
00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.560
<v 0>Also stressed being when been pronounced, more like bin is stressed.</v>

124
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.730
It means that the action occurred a long time ago or that the action or state

125
00:07:06.731 --> 00:07:10.270
has been continuing for a long time. She been married.

126
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.790
This means that she's been married for a long time.

127
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:17.020
The stress on been indicates that the marriage began in the remote past.

128
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.680
So the phrase for a long time is unnecessary. In fact,

129
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.460
when using stress to in it's actually ungrammatical to include an adverbial

130
00:07:24.461 --> 00:07:25.294
phrase like that.

131
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.140
<v 1>Ben finished my homework.</v>

132
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.020
<v 0>There are a few special ways to express the future in AAV.</v>

133
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:36.280
One way is using Goan or gona, which is a contraction of going to.

134
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.560
<v 1>We go visit them. So go now.</v>

135
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.620
<v 0>Is used in casual speech and a lot of varieties of English.</v>

136
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.060
So this is no big surprise.

137
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.050
Another more distinctive future form is finna I'm finna go home.

138
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.270
This is a contraction of fixing too,

139
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.210
which is frequently heard in dialects of the Southern us.

140
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.010
Like I'm fixing to go home.

141
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.050
<v 1>Uh, for the hit the donor second.</v>

142
00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.080
<v 0>Hit the dope or hit the door, meaning leave.</v>

143
00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:03.550
There's also a special form used in the first person, singular I'm, uh.

144
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:06.310
<v 1>I'm away right here while you get ready. I'm.</v>

145
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:11.020
<v 0>Uh, developed as a contraction of I'm gona. It may be a contraction of I'm gona,</v>

146
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:15.340
but it's now used slightly differently as a declaration of immediate action.

147
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.150
Whereas I'm gonna, or I'm going is a little further into the future.

148
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:24.880
Negation, the negative and AAV E is frequently expressed with ain't though.

149
00:08:24.881 --> 00:08:29.800
Not in all contexts with the verb in the simple present tense don't used rather

150
00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:34.780
than ain't, he doesn't live here anymore In the present.

151
00:08:34.781 --> 00:08:36.850
Continuous ain't is used.

152
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:38.890
<v 1>Man. Ain't even trying to hear all that.</v>

153
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:42.190
<v 0>This is like saying I have no interest in hearing what you're saying.</v>

154
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.000
Notice that ain't often blends in with the words around it.

155
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:51.070
I ain't is more like I ain't, I ain't even is more like I, and even.

156
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.260
<v 1>Man, ain't even trying to hear all that.</v>

157
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.700
<v 0>In the past tense. It's I didn't say anything.</v>

158
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.860
It's also used with the present. Perfect. I haven't said anything.

159
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.070
And he said nothing by the way,

160
00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:08.820
notice that there is a specific difference in the verb tense between ISA and I.

161
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.430
It said those aren't random variations.

162
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.950
You might have also noticed that anymore.

163
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:18.210
And anything are replaced with their negative counterparts resulting in a double

164
00:09:18.211 --> 00:09:20.430
negative, actually, both of that.

165
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:25.230
And ain't appear in other dialects of English as well. And aren't unique to Ave,

166
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.960
but it does have a unique kind of double negative,

167
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.980
or sometimes triple negative construction called negative.

168
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.500
<v 1>Can't nobody sing like she can.</v>

169
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.920
<v 0>English. This would be, nobody can sing. Like she can't.</v>

170
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.040
<v 1>Ain't nobody going home til we finish. Nobody's.</v>

171
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.800
<v 0>Going home until we finish in this construction,</v>

172
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:46.790
the auxiliary verb moves to the beginning of the sentence and becomes negative

173
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.090
possessives possession in AAV.

174
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.650
He tends to be shown by syntax with the apostrophe S ending deleted.

175
00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.350
For example, I was in my dad's house.

176
00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.290
Notice that the word dad has no apostrophe S ending,

177
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:04.340
but it's clear that dad is the one who possesses the house because dad comes

178
00:10:04.341 --> 00:10:07.910
right before house in the sentence for possessive adjectives in the third

179
00:10:07.911 --> 00:10:09.440
person, subject pronouns are.

180
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.273
<v 1>Used.</v>

181
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.680
<v 0>Notice that they appears twice one sets the subject. And again,</v>

182
00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:17.450
as the possessor. But again,

183
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.290
we know the second one is possessive because it appears right before the noun

184
00:10:21.291 --> 00:10:24.530
friends ask constructions AAV.

185
00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.960
He features several interesting uses of the word.

186
00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:30.020
First it intensifies an adjective.

187
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.820
<v 1>Who was as some randomized by.</v>

188
00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:36.380
<v 0>This has been adopted by speakers of other varieties of English, to some extent,</v>

189
00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:40.010
and even some speakers of standard English use it in casual settings when they

190
00:10:40.011 --> 00:10:41.300
want it to be more expressive.

191
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:45.860
It also reminds me of something Australians and new Zealanders say to intensify,

192
00:10:45.861 --> 00:10:50.450
adjectives. They might say something like this. Beer is cheap as not,

193
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:55.730
but as the second together with a possessive it's used in place of a

194
00:10:55.731 --> 00:10:57.830
pronoun, but with a sense of urgency,

195
00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.430
this means you're going to learn,

196
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:05.660
but the subtext is that you're chastising or warning someone third.

197
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.330
It can also be used as a reflexive in place.

198
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.600
<v 1>Self, get your inside the house. Gotcha.</v>

199
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.770
<v 0>It means get yourself inside the house. Yo replaces yourself.</v>

200
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.320
This is used in other varieties of English as well,

201
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:21.710
but in a much more limited capacity pronunciation,

202
00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.180
African American vernacular English also has a characteristic accent,

203
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.600
or rather a range of accents that share some common features.

204
00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.790
We can't talk about all those features here,

205
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.330
but let's look at a few of them are list pronunciation, AAV.

206
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.640
He tends to be our list at the end of words,

207
00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:41.540
similar to the accents of England and some Northeastern American accents.

208
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.030
<v 1>Brother, mother, sister.</v>

209
00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:49.580
<v 0>At least in some varieties of AAV E when R appears after O or U the</v>

210
00:11:49.581 --> 00:11:50.570
R disappears.

211
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:55.240
And the word ends in an O sound door dough floor

212
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:58.210
becomes, hello, your becomes,

213
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.860
yo sure becomes show some diphthongs,

214
00:12:02.861 --> 00:12:07.090
become Manav thongs. For example, my ride becomes more,

215
00:12:07.091 --> 00:12:11.110
a ride refers to a car by the way, in standard English,

216
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:15.610
the vowel and my and ride is a diphthong basically meaning that the vowel

217
00:12:15.611 --> 00:12:19.660
shifts from one to another, within a single syllable, uh, I,

218
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:25.090
I in AAV E it's just one continuous vowel sound. Ah,

219
00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:30.460
also my might be pronounced with a Schwab when it's unstressed in rapid speech,

220
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:31.383
like ma.

221
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:33.640
<v 2>Changes in T.</v>

222
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.720
<v 0>H sounds. In other words, interdental fricatives thug and the,</v>

223
00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:42.130
the voiceless T H sound Thur is sometimes replaced by FA.

224
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:47.100
<v 2>Beth Bev South South. The way these teams.</v>

225
00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:51.030
<v 0>H sounds are rendered as FA reminds me of some dialects spoken in England,</v>

226
00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:55.200
voiceless sometimes becomes tough or cut.

227
00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:58.920
This sound is a voiceless dental stop,

228
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.460
which is somewhere between a T sound and thumb.

229
00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:07.350
The voiceless T H sound with might become. And in that sample,

230
00:13:07.351 --> 00:13:12.300
you can hear the globalization of the T sound. It often becomes a global stop,

231
00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.960
just like tea does in general, American English in certain contexts,

232
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:20.910
like at the end of a word, voiced, the sometimes becomes de or the,

233
00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.920
this is a voice to dental stop.

234
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:26.910
You could say that it's somewhere between D a D sound and the voice,

235
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.340
the sound that might be.

236
00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:31.590
<v 2>That some.</v>

237
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:32.880
<v 0>Consonants are silent.</v>

238
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:37.020
This includes the final continent in some continent clusters, for instance,

239
00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:41.040
past is pronounced pairs and hand becomes

240
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.510
to be clear. This happens in other accents as well, including mine,

241
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.890
but it tends to be more consistent in AAV E even in some contexts in which I

242
00:13:49.891 --> 00:13:50.940
would pronounce the sound.

243
00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:55.650
Also initial consonant sounds are sometimes dropped in auxiliary verbs like

244
00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.610
don't and quasi auxiliary verbs like Ghana, I don't know,

245
00:13:59.611 --> 00:14:04.350
becomes no. This process probably also resulted in the future form.

246
00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:08.430
I'm up that we saw before some words have different stress,

247
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:12.720
which can actually undo the vowel reduction of standard English in standard

248
00:14:12.721 --> 00:14:15.480
English. Well, at least in general, American English,

249
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:20.250
this word is pronounced police in AAV E it's, pronounced police.

250
00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:23.730
Actually, the man in the recording stresses the second syllable,

251
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.920
but it's often stressed on the first syllable.

252
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:30.240
And as with some other features of AAV E this is also a feature of Southern

253
00:14:30.241 --> 00:14:33.840
speech in general. So that's interesting, right? In my accent,

254
00:14:33.841 --> 00:14:36.270
the O is dropped or at least reduced,

255
00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:39.120
but in AAV E the O is clearly pronounced.

256
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:43.920
So when sounds are dropped in a dialect like AAV E is that any different from me

257
00:14:43.921 --> 00:14:47.760
dropping certain sounds when I speak the truth is that the phonology of any

258
00:14:47.761 --> 00:14:50.700
spoken variety of English is separate from English spelling.

259
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:55.070
And every variety has somewhat different phonological rules that it speakers

260
00:14:55.071 --> 00:14:59.840
follow should speakers of AAV E be encouraged to give up their dialect in favor

261
00:14:59.841 --> 00:15:01.700
of standard English. Well,

262
00:15:01.701 --> 00:15:05.120
keep in mind that all over the world in various different languages,

263
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.900
there are dialects that people use in informal situations while they learn the

264
00:15:08.901 --> 00:15:12.320
standard language at school and use that in formal situations,

265
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:16.700
including writing. There are dialects of German, Japanese, Arabic,

266
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.230
and countless other languages.

267
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.830
And people switch between dialectal speech and standard speech.

268
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.330
Depending on the context,

269
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:27.020
you can make a good argument that everyone in a society should learn the

270
00:15:27.021 --> 00:15:30.860
standard language well in order to increase their opportunities and to improve

271
00:15:30.861 --> 00:15:33.620
communication between different segments of society.

272
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.380
But there's nothing that makes a dialect incorrect.

273
00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:38.720
If your intention is to speak that dialect,

274
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:43.070
while speaking a dialect at a job interview might be incorrect. In that context,

275
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.160
speaking it with your friends is not so standard.

276
00:15:46.161 --> 00:15:50.480
English is clearly an important tool, but Ave is not inferior to it.

277
00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:54.170
It's simply different from standard English, just as all dialects are.

278
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.980
That includes the dialects of great Britain, Ireland, Australia,

279
00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:02.090
and everywhere else that English has spoken the question of the day to speakers

280
00:16:02.091 --> 00:16:04.070
of African American vernacular English.

281
00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:06.470
To what extent do you use it in daily life?

282
00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.780
And to what extent do you use standard English?

283
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:13.340
And can you add any features of AAV that didn't appear in the video and to

284
00:16:13.341 --> 00:16:14.060
others?

285
00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:17.990
Are there any words or expressions you use that originally came from Ave?

286
00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:22.100
What are they leave your responses in the comments down below the men who

287
00:16:22.101 --> 00:16:24.320
recorded the audio samples for this video,

288
00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:28.070
Lawrence is an artist who creates fantastic portraits like these,

289
00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.560
and he can create custom portraits of you too.

290
00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:33.740
I recommend you follow him on Instagram and check out his work.

291
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:38.240
I also want to give a big shout out to all the Lang focus, Patrion supporters,
