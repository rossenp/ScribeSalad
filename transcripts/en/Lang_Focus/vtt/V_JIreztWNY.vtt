and video lessons for students of all levels. Hello, everyone.

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.390
Welcome to the Lang focus channel. And my name is Paul. Today.

6
00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:22.260
We're going to compare to Gallog, otherwise known as Filipino,

7
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.350
the lingua franca of the Philippines and Indonesia,

8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.090
the lingua franca of Indonesia,

9
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.980
the most widely spoken variety of Molay basically everything I say about

10
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.690
Indonesian.

11
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.960
And this video will also apply to Molay because their standard forms are very

12
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:39.810
close to each other, aside from some different vocabulary.

13
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.500
But since I'm more familiar with Indonesian, the samples in this video,

14
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.240
we'll focus on Indonesia to Tagalog on the one hand and Indonesian and other

15
00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:51.660
forms of Molay on the other are not mutually intelligible,

16
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.560
but native speakers of either language often say that they feel they should be

17
00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:57.960
able to understand the other language, but they can't.

18
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.800
This is probably due to their similar pronunciation and intonation,

19
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.010
and they might also hear some similar words in the other language,

20
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.660
partly because of the common origins of the two languages Molay including

21
00:01:09.661 --> 00:01:10.350
Indonesian,

22
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.520
since they're essentially the same language and to get log are both members of

23
00:01:14.521 --> 00:01:17.940
the Maliah Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family.

24
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.260
That means they developed from the same language proton Maliah Polynesian,

25
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.550
from which all members of that branch descendant speakers of proteome Maliah

26
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.750
Polynesian first migrated from Taiwan to Northern Luzon in the Philippines

27
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.040
before spreading out across much of maritime Southeast Asia and the Pacific,

28
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.990
most of the languages of Philippines and most of the languages of Malaysia and

29
00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:44.820
Indonesia outside of Papa, that is also descended from proton Maliah Polynesian.

30
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.180
So at their core Malaya and Tagalog are related though.

31
00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:51.480
They've been diverging from each other for at least 4,000 years,

32
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.440
and maybe much longer during that time they have developed their own features

33
00:01:55.441 --> 00:02:00.300
and have undergone different influences influences on Malai Sanskrit had a

34
00:02:00.301 --> 00:02:04.200
heavy influence on Malaysia vocabulary and literature beginning in the seventh

35
00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:07.320
century, followed by Arabic in the 14th century.

36
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.790
Once Islam was established in the archipelago later on Molay was

37
00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:16.200
influenced by English in British colonial territories and Dutch in the Dutch

38
00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:18.900
colonial territories, modern Indonesian,

39
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.350
which began to be called Indonesian only in 1928,

40
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.530
contains more Dutch influence while Malaysia in Malaysia,

41
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.210
Brunei in Singapore contains more English influence influences on Tagalog.

42
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.840
One of the major influences on tagalo was actually Molay,

43
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.510
which served as a lingua franca throughout maritime,

44
00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:38.130
Southeast Asia for centuries.

45
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.360
So some of the similarities between Malaya and tagalo STEM from their ancient

46
00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:46.500
common origin and some of their similarities STEM from the more recent influence

47
00:02:46.501 --> 00:02:47.790
of Malayan on Tagalog,

48
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.250
then the Spanish arrived in Philippines in 1521 and left a massive footprint

49
00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:55.410
on to Gallo and other Filipino languages.

50
00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.730
What percentage up to Gallog words come from Spanish estimates range from 20%

51
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:01.840
to 33%.

52
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.560
This definitely accounts for a lot of the difference in vocabulary between

53
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.450
tagalo log and Malayan. Indonesia,

54
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.680
Philippines also became a colony of the United States for several decades,

55
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:14.200
beginning in 1898. And as a result,

56
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.250
English as the second official language of Philippines and takeout log has many

57
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:22.840
borrowings from English. Since I'm focusing on Indonesian for the samples,

58
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.770
I'm simply going to refer to it as Indonesian from now on rather than saying

59
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.980
Indonesia and Malaysia all the time. Generally speaking,

60
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.760
Indonesian and Tagalog are fairly different in terms of grammar and sentence

61
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:36.760
structure, in terms of pronunciation, they're quite similar.

62
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.100
Stop consonants in both Indonesian and the gal log are [inaudible] meaning that

63
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:44.320
there's no puff of air after the continent.

64
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.860
The way they are often is after to and cook in English.

65
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.080
They both also lack Viva and fo sounds except for a small number of lone words,

66
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.050
but many speakers will pronounce them as BA and BA.

67
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.850
They also have similar sets of vowels to Kellogg has five, ah,

68
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.410
a E O oo, and Indonesia has five vowel letters.

69
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.070
But with six sounds, because E is pronounced two ways,

70
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.140
either as or as a Schwab in terms of vocabulary,

71
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.800
the majority of words are different, but there are also many similar words,

72
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.370
including many common basic core words. For example,

73
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.080
some personal pronouns and family vocabulary are similar. The words for it.

74
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.920
<v 1>You singular go eco</v>

75
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.930

00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:49.470

basic States and emotions. Hope ASA, ASA,

sick or sickness. It's not cute. Suck it delicious.

109
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:39.050
So depth set up in tagalo.

110
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.720
<v 0>This is the most common word you see in advertisements and so on in Indonesian</v>

111
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.500
enact. Yeah.

112
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.720
<v 1>It's more common to be afraid,</v>

113
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.650
doc taco to laugh Tala

114

Salama safety Salama.

115
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.750
<v 0>Log it's basic. Meaning is thank you. Whereas in Malayan, Indonesian,</v>

116
00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.680
it's often used in greetings like Salama buggy, meaning good morning,

117
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:04.930
other basic verbs.

118
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.790
<v 1>Berta bossa enter muscle Paso.</v>

119
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.380
<v 0>It's worth pointing out that ma and PA are both bilabial sounds.</v>

120
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.960
They are both articulated with your lips together.

121
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.500
So it would be easy for one sound to gradually change into the other.

122
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.040
To drink me noon, to open.

123
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.270
<v 1>Boca Boca, to help all along.</v>

124
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.500
<v 0>Of course, I've been intentionally pointing out words that are similar,</v>

125
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.290
but I want to be clear that most words are not the Sam.

126
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.980
So let's look at some sentences in either language so that we can compare their

127
00:07:38.981 --> 00:07:39.940
sentence structures,

128
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.660
but we can also see a more representative sample of their vocabulary.

129
00:07:43.661 --> 00:07:48.610
In general. These sentences mean my child likes cats first and Indonesian

130
00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:54.850
word for word it's child, my like cats and into God.

131
00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:58.630
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

132
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.480
<v 0>For word it's like focus, marker child.</v>

133
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:06.040
My two pleural marker cat. One part here seems similar.

134
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.140
<v 1>I'm not [inaudible].</v>

135
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.270
<v 0>But we could change this word here. Bussa to poutine, which means kitten.</v>

136
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.460
Then the sentences would be even more similar.

137
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:19.540
We can see that Indonesian is basically SVO at its core.

138
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:24.580
S V O to Kellogg is basically V S O but another way

139
00:08:24.581 --> 00:08:27.190
to think of it is as predicate subject,

140
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:31.000
because it's not always a verb in this position. In fact, this word here,

141
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:35.260
mahi league is not actually a verb. It's an adjective meaning fond of,

142
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.560
but a verb would appear here in the same position. Basically,

143
00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:42.280
these two pieces of the sentence are reversed in Indonesian and to Kellogg,

144
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.460
that's the more common than natural word order into catalog,

145
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.330
but there's also an inverted word order. That's more similar to Indonesian,

146
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.630
but is generally considered less natural and is used less often.

147
00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.900
<v 1>[Inaudible] the subject here on a call.</v>

148
00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:02.600
<v 0>At the beginning, followed by the inversion marker. I followed by the predicate.</v>

149
00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.940
This is less common and more formal,

150
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:08.930
but probably more intuitive for an Indonesian speaker and for English speakers

151
00:09:08.931 --> 00:09:12.500
as well. Notice that the tequila sentence has this word,

152
00:09:12.501 --> 00:09:16.520
that the Indonesian sentence doesn't have on a focus marker.

153
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.070
This comes before the focus of the sentence,

154
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.170
whether it's the subject or the object.

155
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.700
Another thing the Indonesian sentence doesn't have is a plural marker like manga

156
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:31.040
in Indonesian, the plural can be shown with reduplicate like witching coaching,

157
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:35.540
but it's not always used. Of course, Indonesian also lacks an inversion marker,

158
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:39.170
like the word I, and to Kellogg in general to get log features,

159
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.140
more little function, words and particles than Indonesian does,

160
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:44.810
especially standard Indonesian colloquial.

161
00:09:44.811 --> 00:09:48.380
Indonesian has some more little words like that. Verbs.

162
00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:52.820
One difference between Indonesian and tagalo verbs is that an Indonesian,

163
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:57.230
they have no conjugations for tents or aspect while to gala verbs are

164
00:09:57.231 --> 00:09:58.880
conjugated for aspect though.

165
00:09:58.881 --> 00:10:02.150
Neither language has different conjugations for person and number.

166
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.740
Let's look at a quick example with Indonesian muscle and Tagalog Pesach,

167
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:11.510
meaning enter these sentences mean he entered the school in Indonesian

168
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.090
Nicola and into Gelug.

169
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:16.910
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

170
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:21.380
<v 0>In the tequila verb. There's an infect, which is used for completed actions,</v>

171
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:23.720
but there's nothing like that in the Indonesian verb.

172
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.450
If we want to talk about an action that's happening now,

173
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.960
like he's entering the school. It's like this in Indonesian

174
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:32.683
[inaudible] and integrate.

175
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.270
<v 1>Well, my [inaudible].</v>

176
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.360
<v 0>If we want to talk about an action that hasn't happened yet,</v>

177
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.600
like he will enter the school. It's like this in Indonesia.

178
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:44.660
<v 2>[Inaudible] and then together.</v>

179
00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:47.240
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

180
00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.270
<v 0>Notice that in Indonesian, the verb itself doesn't change,</v>

181
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.230
but rather an aspect marker comes before the verb and it may be left out.

182
00:10:54.231 --> 00:10:56.990
If the context makes it clear already into Kellogg,

183
00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.090
the verb itself is inflected differently.

184
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:04.160
You may also notice that some of the Tagalog inflections are in fixes in the

185
00:11:04.161 --> 00:11:06.560
first case. And in the second case,

186
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.290
there's a doubling of the first syllable followed by the,

187
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:13.490
in fixing of Indonesian verbs do not have in fixes.

188
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.800
There are numerous prefixes and suffixes,

189
00:11:15.801 --> 00:11:18.950
which changed the meaning of the verb in different ways. For example,

190
00:11:18.951 --> 00:11:21.680
by making it transitive or causative or passive,

191
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.930
but there's nothing for tents or aspect,

192
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:30.200
actor focus and patient focus into Kellogg verbs are either actor focus or

193
00:11:30.201 --> 00:11:31.280
patient focus.

194
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.060
That means they have different conjugations depending on whether the focus of

195
00:11:35.061 --> 00:11:38.900
the sentence is on the doer of the action or the receiver of the action.

196
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.630
For example, the student read a second.

197
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.620
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

198
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.880
<v 0>This is actor focus. So the focus is on the student, the doer of the action.</v>

199
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.673
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

200
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.640
<v 0>A student read the science book. This is patient focus.</v>

201
00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:00.970
So the focus is on libral the receiver of the action.

202
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:05.140
You can see that the verb inflections that are in fixed to the root are

203
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:07.540
different for actor focus and patient focus.

204
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.500
You can also see that there are two words that are switched in either sentence.

205
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:16.750
Um, and none on is the InFocus marker. And none is the out of focus.

206
00:12:16.751 --> 00:12:19.210
Marker. As a quick side note,

207
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:23.740
I should point out that the noun with the InFocus marker on is often interpreted

208
00:12:23.741 --> 00:12:24.640
as definite.

209
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.450
Whereas the noun with the out-of-focus marker is often interpreted as

210
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.313
indefinite,

211
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.820
but definiteness can be changed by adding additional words like [inaudible]

212
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:34.833
meaning one.

213
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.250
And it can also be understood from context based on what has been previously

214
00:12:39.251 --> 00:12:40.084
mentioned.

215
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:45.370
Indonesian doesn't exactly have active focus and patient focus like tagalo does

216
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.800
it does have something similar, but simpler,

217
00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:51.280
a distinction between subject focus and object focus.

218
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:55.000
Subject focus is the basic type of sentence. Like this sentence,

219
00:12:55.001 --> 00:12:56.860
meaning a student read a science.

220
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.090
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

221
00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:03.630
<v 0>Technically Indonesian has no definite or indefinite articles.</v>

222
00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:06.330
So the announced here could also be considered definite,

223
00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:10.260
but we could more explicitly express definiteness by adding Nia,

224
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:13.230
which means it's either now or to both.

225
00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:16.333
<v 1>[Inaudible] yeah.</v>

226
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.450
<v 0>Or you could use the demonstrative pronoun.</v>

227
00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.560
It meaning that object focus usually places.

228
00:13:22.561 --> 00:13:23.790
The object first.

229
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:26.890
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

230
00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:31.080
<v 0>Science book was read by the student. Alternatively, this could be.</v>

231
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:34.403
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

232
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:37.890
<v 0>Book is what the student read. Notice that in Indonesian,</v>

233
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:41.640
there are no markers that show focus or lack of focus like there are.

234
00:13:41.641 --> 00:13:42.474
And to Gallog,

235
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:47.010
we usually know whether it's subject focus or object focus based on which one

236
00:13:47.011 --> 00:13:50.910
comes first in an object focused sentence in the third person,

237
00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:55.080
the prefix deep attaches to the verb, but in the first and second person,

238
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:56.730
any prefixes dropped from the.

239
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.120
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

240
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.200
<v 0>Dan's book is what I read.</v>

241
00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:05.910
Notice that the verb Bacha doesn't have its usual prefix mum,

242
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.950
because the sentence is object focus and it doesn't have the prefixed D because

243
00:14:10.951 --> 00:14:15.030
that's only for third person into Kellogg.

244
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:19.170
All the personal pronouns are different depending on whether they are in focus

245
00:14:19.171 --> 00:14:20.250
or out of focus.

246
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:24.960
The out-of-focus ones are actually genitive pronouns because they're also used

247
00:14:24.961 --> 00:14:29.100
as possessives in Indonesian. Most personal pronouns are the same,

248
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.220
regardless of whether they are the focus of the sentence or not,

249
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:37.350
as you can probably see tagalo on the one hand and Indonesian and Malai on the

250
00:14:37.351 --> 00:14:41.460
other clearly have some similar features that show that they are related such as

251
00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:45.300
they're similar pronunciation and similar core basic vocabulary.

252
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.830
But it's also obvious that they have diverged so much that they are not mutually

253
00:14:49.831 --> 00:14:51.060
intelligible with each other,

254
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.630
partly because of their different sentence structure.

255
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.810
And partly because of their largely different vocabulary.

256
00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:01.040
It's worth remembering that together log is just one language of the Philippines

257
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.730
and that there are many languages spoken in Indonesia and Malaysia speaking

258
00:15:04.731 --> 00:15:09.350
countries like Malaysia and Brunei as well to Kellogg and Malayan Indonesian are

259
00:15:09.351 --> 00:15:13.040
not necessarily the two most similar languages from those countries.

260
00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:17.540
The question of the day for speakers up to Gallagher and Malayan Indonesian.

261
00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.510
How well do you understand speakers of the other language?

262
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:22.250
Do you understand anything?

263
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.830
Do you recognize some words when you hear the other language?

264
00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:26.870
