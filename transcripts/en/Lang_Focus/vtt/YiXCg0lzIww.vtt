Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Lang focus channel. And my name is Paul. Today.

5
00:00:17.011 --> 00:00:20.240
We're going to focus on the Swedish language. The

6
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.330
[inaudible] in Swedish or adjust civilians.

7
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.030
Swedish has spoken by around 10 million people, mainly in Sweden,

8
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.700
where it's the native language of around 8 million people.

9
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.110
And also in Finland where it's the second official language after finished with

10
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.750
around 270,000 native speakers.

11
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.570
It's a continental North dramatic language,

12
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.360
which is closely related to Norwegian and Danish,

13
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.110
and is mutually intelligible with them to some extent the degree,

14
00:00:48.111 --> 00:00:52.340
depending on the dialects in question like all North dramatic languages.

15
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.680
Swedish is at the ascendance of old Norse,

16
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.600
which developed from prodo Germanic by the eighth century over the next 600

17
00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:03.800
years or so old North developed into the various North dramatic languages of

18
00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:08.390
today, old North first diverged into old West North in Norway,

19
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.800
Iceland, and the Faroe islands and oldest North's in Sweden and Denmark.

20
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.900
All these snores then divided into old Danish and old Swedish by around the 13th

21
00:01:17.901 --> 00:01:21.740
century. All these North is sometimes referred to as runic,

22
00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:23.540
Swedish and runic Danish,

23
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.410
even though they were basically the same until around the year 1100.

24
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.010
This name comes from the fact that it was written in the runic alphabet,

25
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.590
specifically the younger Fouth Ark alphabet,

26
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.390
the Latin alphabet was adopted in Sweden around 1225 due to the

27
00:01:38.391 --> 00:01:39.830
Christianization of Sweden.

28
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.210
And this marks the beginning of the old Swedish period later that century,

29
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.460
the Hanseatic league began to arise.

30
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.750
It was an Alliance of middle low German speaking trade communities spread out

31
00:01:50.751 --> 00:01:53.030
across the Baltic region and Scandinavia,

32
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.800
including the major cities of Sweden through its domination of trade over the

33
00:01:57.801 --> 00:01:59.030
next several centuries.

34
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.690
And through the settlement of aristocratic families from what is now Northern

35
00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:03.350
Germany,

36
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.370
middle low German had a significant impact on the vocabulary of Swedish.

37
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.580
Swedish also became simpler in its grammar,

38
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.340
as it developed from old Swedish to modern Swedish.

39
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.110
It originally had a more complex case system for cases rather than the current

40
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.910
two cases, three genders,

41
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.600
rather than the current two genders and the more complex verb system,

42
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.070
the printing press and the publishing of a Swedish Bible in the 16th century,

43
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.270
the Gustaf Vasa Bible marked the beginning of the modern Swedish period.

44
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.370
The Gustaf Vasa Bible was a major step towards more standardized orthography,

45
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.530
but it wasn't until the 19th and 20th centuries that Swedish became more uniform

46
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.630
due to migration and urbanization.

47
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.890
And a standard language was created by the time of the spelling reform of

48
00:02:48.891 --> 00:02:53.780
1906. Swedish was almost the same as the contemporary Swedish in use today.

49
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.740
Today. Standard Swedish dominates throughout Sweden in general,

50
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.050
and most people are fluent. It regional dialects are still widely spoken though.

51
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.710
They are not quite as distinct as they once were because of the influence of

52
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:09.910
standard Swedish. The main dialectal difference today lies in accent.

53
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.210
Let's examine some of the features of Swedish focusing on standard Swedish.

54
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.720
There are 29 letters in the Swedish alphabet, nine of them,

55
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.420
vowel letters and 20 of them consonant letters.

56
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.410
But those letters represent more than 29 distinct phonemes.

57
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.150
The vowel letters represent pairs of short vowels and long vowels with short

58
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:33.340
vowels appearing before a long continent.

59
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.630
That means two or more consonants and long vowels appearing before a short

60
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.100
continent, meaning a single continent or before a vowel or at the end of a word.

61
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.270
In most cases, the long and short vowels are also different in quality,

62
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.370
not only length, for example,

63
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.690
this word has a long vowel in loss and it means a glass.

64
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.680
This word has a short, a vowel plus, and it means ice cream.

65
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.880
This word has a long vowel BU and it means cure.

66
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.170
This word has a short vowel boots and it means stayed

67
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.130
standard. Swedish has no phonemic diphthongs though.

68
00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:12.430
Some dialects such as the Scania and dialects of Southern Sweden,

69
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:16.390
do some consonant sounds are represented by diagraphs.

70
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.340
These diagraphs all represent the sound year as does the letter J as well

71
00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:23.140
as G before front vowels.

72
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.270
These diagraphs all represent the sound as it does S K before front

73
00:04:28.271 --> 00:04:30.700
vowels. Otherwise it's pronounced sky.

74
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.530
These diagraphs represent sure as does K before front vowels.

75
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.570
Otherwise it's pronounced cut. And sometimes C H, which is used in loan words.

76
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.200
This diagraph represents Ghana at the beginning of words,

77
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.780
and no in other contexts,

78
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.750
this diagraph represents no or [inaudible].

79
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.560
And these diagraphs represent retroflex consonants.

80
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.100
The retroflex element being shown by the R in each diagraph.

81
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.080
The standard sound represented by R is a voiced alveolar trill,

82
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.150
and at some words and alveolar tap,

83
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.380
but this is one sound that differs depending on the dialect with some Southern

84
00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:09.400
dialects of Swedish,

85
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.510
pronouncing it as a uvular trill or as a voiceless or a voice to uvular

86
00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:18.280
fricative the letter G is normally either pronounced like a hard G

87
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.230
or yeah, before front vowels.

88
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.150
It's never pronounced just like the soft G in English like Norwegian.

89
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.290
Swedish has pitch accent, a shift in tone on the stressed syllable,

90
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.210
like in Norwegian, there are two tone patterns. Tone. One is a rising tone.

91
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.620
The pitch rises on the stressed syllable then falls on the unstressed syllable

92
00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:42.910
that follows tone. Two is a falling rising, falling tone.

93
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.320
The pitch falls on the stressed syllable then rises and falls again on the

94
00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:51.910
unstressed syllable that follows many pairs of words can be distinguished based

95
00:05:51.911 --> 00:05:56.170
on their pitch accent. Here's an example in tone one, Ooh, gala,

96
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.100
meaning the book and.

97
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.800
<v 1>In tone to bull gum, meaning.</v>

98
00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.800
<v 0>Overripe or spoiled regarding fruit tone to normally appears in words</v>

99
00:06:05.801 --> 00:06:10.300
with multiple syllables and inflection. Aside from the definite article tone,

100
00:06:10.301 --> 00:06:14.470
one normally appears in words with only one syllable and words with the definite

101
00:06:14.471 --> 00:06:15.430
article attached,

102
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.540
the N in book-in is a definite article.

103
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.000
<v 1>Dulles, the boot Dylan. This means I.</v>

104
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.300
<v 0>Read the book word for word it's. I read book,</v>

105
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.140
the Swedish word order is SVO as an English.

106
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.440
The only difference here being the placement of the definite article,

107
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.620
the definite article, it takes the form of a suffix in Swedish,

108
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.030
and it's formed depends on the gender and number of the now modern Swedish,

109
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.760
at least in its standard form has two genders,

110
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.900
common gender and neutral gender for singular common gender announced.

111
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.730
The definite article is usually N or after a vowel oo gala.

112
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.930
The definite article for singular neuter nouns is at or.

113
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.000
<v 1>To stilette. However.</v>

114
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.970
<v 0>The final T is usually silent in most accents.</v>

115
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.040
Unlike the definite article,

116
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:07.760
the indefinite article comes before the now and for common announce and

117
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.180
BU and at for neuter notes.

118
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.390
How about for plural nouns?

119
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.380
Indefinite plural nouns are formed by adding indefinite suffixes,

120
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.570
which differ depending on the nouns ending.

121
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.480
<v 1>Book, good books, still alum.</v>

122
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.080
<v 0>Leases for plural definite nouns in the common gender.</v>

123
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.570
You add NA to the indefinite plural.

124
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.210
<v 1>The books for plural.</v>

125
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:35.740
<v 0>Definite nouns in the neutral gender. You add on to those ending in a vowel,</v>

126
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.570
and you add N to those ending in a continent, Stella, the places.

127
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:43.720
<v 1>[Inaudible]. This.</v>

128
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.190
<v 0>Means he doesn't drink coffee word for word it's he drink not coffee.</v>

129
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.420
Again, this sentence is SVO with one difference from English syntax,

130
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.620
the negation marker in that comes after the verb, rather than before it.

131
00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:01.420
And also notice that well, English has the auxiliary verb do here in the form.

132
00:08:01.421 --> 00:08:06.160
Doesn't Swedish has no equivalent of that. If we make the sentence affirmative,

133
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.010
it shares the same syntax as its English translation.

134
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:15.070
[inaudible] he drinks coffee Han is the third person singular personal pronoun.

135
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.880
Swedish has a system of personal pronouns, similar to that of English,

136
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.510
with a couple of differences. There are second person plural pronouns,

137
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.870
which are also used as formal second person, singular pronouns.

138
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.140
There are also two equivalents of it in English,

139
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:33.190
one for common gender den and one for nutrient death.

140
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.810
And there is also a controversial gender neutral pronoun hen.

141
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.960
This is not a pronoun that arose naturally in Swedish,

142
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:45.160
but it was constructed in order to replace the use of masculine pronouns in

143
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:49.090
contexts. When you are not specifically referring to a man or a woman, you know,

144
00:08:49.091 --> 00:08:52.090
in English, I might use he or she in such a context.

145
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.940
Some people accept this pronoun at others rejected.

146
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.800
It isn't widely used in speech, but it's sometimes used in writing and on.

147
00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:04.190
<v 1>TV. [inaudible] does he drink coffee jar? The yard hub?</v>

148
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:05.203
Yes, he does.

149
00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.550
<v 0>As you can see from this question in Swedish,</v>

150
00:09:07.551 --> 00:09:09.860
it's very simple to form a yes or no question.

151
00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.600
You simply move to the verb to the front.

152
00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.360
<v 1>Took the sentence [inaudible].</v>

153
00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.950
<v 0>Does he drink beer? Uh, is a cognitive, the English word ale.</v>

154
00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:21.410
<v 1>No.</v>

155
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:24.080
<v 0>He doesn't the most common way to answer. Yes or no.</v>

156
00:09:24.081 --> 00:09:29.060
Questions is to first say yaw or ne followed by death than a verb followed

157
00:09:29.061 --> 00:09:33.170
by the pronoun than the negation marker intent. If it's negative.

158
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.520
In many cases, the verbiage.

159
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:39.310
<v 1>Form of Jara, which means do for each.</v>

160
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.810
<v 0>Verb tents, there was only one form of the verb.</v>

161
00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:45.230
It doesn't change depending on who or how many people are speaking.

162
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:46.820
So in the present tense it's.

163
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.200
<v 1>Yeah, I do do yard. You do how many yard.</v>

164
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.370
<v 0>He does, et cetera. In the past tense it's [inaudible].</v>

165
00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.940
<v 1>Do what you would, that you did, honey. You would, that he.</v>

166
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.130
<v 0>Did et cetera. In the future. It's.</v>

167
00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:06.290
<v 1>[Inaudible] I will do discuss Jara. You will do [inaudible].</v>

168
00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:07.790
<v 0>He will do et cetera.</v>

169
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.510
Obviously this makes verbs easier to use than in many other languages.

170
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:14.120
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

171
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.830
<v 0>I've never been to Norway word for word it's. I have never been in Norway.</v>

172
00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.040
This is almost word for word. The same as the English sentence,

173
00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.710
except that he translates as in,

174
00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:28.130
rather than to this sentence features the present perfect,

175
00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.980
which is formed in a similar way to its English equivalent.

176
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:35.450
Notice that I said similar, not the same here. We have the auxiliary verb,

177
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:40.010
the present form of the verb hall, which means half over here,

178
00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.760
we have a form of the verb, Vara, meaning beat in English.

179
00:10:43.761 --> 00:10:46.190
We use the past participle, but in Swedish,

180
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.200
it's a different form called the supine.

181
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:52.640
And there's a different past participle form for other uses notice also that the

182
00:10:52.641 --> 00:10:55.020
adverb comes between the two.

183
00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.530
<v 1>But then why not buy preferred means.</v>

184
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.260
<v 0>Why? And there's a cognate of the archaic English word, wherefore,</v>

185
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:07.250
which you may know from Romeo and Juliet, wherefore art thou Romeo,

186
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.910
which doesn't mean where are you Romeo? Like most people think it does.

187
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:15.380
It means why are you Romeo? As in, why can't you be from a different family?

188
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.700
But I digress.

189
00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:19.280
<v 1>[Inaudible] in order. Yeah. And its value.</v>

190
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.980
<v 0>It's more expensive in Norway than in Sweden.</v>

191
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:27.170
Word for word it's beer is more expensive in Norway than in Sweden.

192
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.690
It almost translates directly into English,

193
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.930
except for the way the comparative is expressed in English.

194
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.530
There are two comparative forms first with the ER suffix.

195
00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:41.210
And second with more before the adjective with most two syllable adjectives and

196
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.540
all adjectives with three or more syllables in Swedish,

197
00:11:44.541 --> 00:11:46.700
it's similar with single syllable adjectives,

198
00:11:46.701 --> 00:11:51.020
taking the suffix audit and adjectives with two or more syllables being

199
00:11:51.021 --> 00:11:53.590
proceeded by me. In this case,

200
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.200
the English word expensive has three syllables.

201
00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.700
So it uses more while the Swedish word has only one syllable.

202
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:04.990
So it takes the audit ending. One more thing to note here is the verb.

203
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:09.280
Add it is the present tense conjugation of the verb. Vara,

204
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:14.470
meaning to be Varda is the infinitive form it developed from old Norse

205
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.520
VESA. Then it became Vera. Then it became Vara.

206
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:22.930
The English verb to be in all its different conjugations developed from two

207
00:12:22.931 --> 00:12:23.860
different verbs,

208
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:29.110
old English bale and old English ways on which has cognate with the Swedish.

209
00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:34.050
<v 1>Word. [inaudible] may alt superlatives</v>

210
00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:36.630
[inaudible].

211
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:39.240
<v 0>It's the biggest city in Sweden word-for-word it's,</v>

212
00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:41.940
which is Sweden's biggest city. Here.

213
00:12:41.941 --> 00:12:44.370
We have the question word [inaudible] meaning,

214
00:12:44.371 --> 00:12:48.180
which next we see [inaudible]. As I mentioned earlier,

215
00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:51.870
Swedish used to have four cases, but now it only has two,

216
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.760
the nominative and the genitive,

217
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:58.530
which is shown with an S at the end of the now similar to how apostrophe S is

218
00:12:58.531 --> 00:13:00.180
used in English to show possession.

219
00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:05.400
Next [inaudible] is the super lucrative form of [inaudible], which means big,

220
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.810
just like Swedish has comparative forms that partly resemble the English ones.

221
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.880
In this case, it stowed it bigger.

222
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:15.360
It also has a superlative form that partly resembles the English.

223
00:13:15.361 --> 00:13:18.300
One star is like the S ending in English,

224
00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:20.640
but this one might not be the best example,

225
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:24.780
come to think of it because it's irregular most single syllable adjectives take

226
00:13:24.781 --> 00:13:28.020
the ending us, or I stay like.

227
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:29.063
<v 1>Do your.</v>

228
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.110
<v 0>Most expensive.</v>

229
00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:36.180
The form with the E at the end Asti is used when the adjective is definite,

230
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:40.350
particularly when proceeded by a definite article or genitive pronoun.

231
00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:45.990
Multi-syllable adjectives from the Superleague when messed comes before them

232
00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:48.690
like English, most, most intelligent would.

233
00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:50.880
<v 1>Be missed in the ligament. The.</v>

234
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:55.380
<v 0>Rules about single syllable words and multi-syllable words are not 100%.</v>

235
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:59.610
In fact, this word could also be set with asked rather than messed,

236
00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.350
but the rule is generally true.

237
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.040
<v 1>So that is the stop stop cone.</v>

238
00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:09.900
<v 0>The biggest city in Sweden is Stockholm word for word Sweden's biggest city is</v>

239
00:14:09.901 --> 00:14:10.734
Stockholm.

240
00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.070
<v 1>You have the body until it gets to some Stockholm.</v>

241
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.940
<v 0>Gotham, Berg isn't as big as Stockholm word for word it's Gotham.</v>

242
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:20.670
Berg is not like big as Stockholm.

243
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:25.590
Comparisons of equality are formed in Swedish by using plus an

244
00:14:25.591 --> 00:14:30.030
adjective followed by some literally equal adjective.

245
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:35.100
As Lyrica is a cognate of English like in its use as an adverb.

246
00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:37.820
<v 1>Do a little [inaudible].</v>

247
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:43.020
<v 0>You are as tall as Ella word for word, you are equally tall as Ella,</v>

248
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.850
you may be getting the sense that Swedish has quite similar to English in its

249
00:14:47.851 --> 00:14:50.790
grammar. And to some extent in its Germanic vocabulary,

250
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:54.770
English speaking learners of Swedish are often struck by just how similar the

251
00:14:54.771 --> 00:14:57.350
two are and by how intuitive Swedish is for them.

252
00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:01.310
The bigger challenges in learning Swedish seem to lie in the pronunciation and

253
00:15:01.311 --> 00:15:05.210
the early stages and in getting used to dialectal variation and different

254
00:15:05.211 --> 00:15:06.830
accents in the later stages.

255
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:11.030
But all in all people who learn Swedish overwhelmingly enjoy the process and

256
00:15:11.031 --> 00:15:12.500
their efforts are well rewarded.

257
00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.410
The question of the day for speakers of Swedish.

258
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.410
To what extent would you say that you speak standard Swedish?

259
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:22.670
And to what extent do you use your local dialect and to people who have studied

260
00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:24.800
Swedish? What has your experience been like?

261
00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.200
What have you found easy and what have you found challenging?

262
00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.680
You're excited to learn more Swedish,

263
00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:34.030
then click the link in the description to visit Swedish pod one Oh one or visit

264
00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.550
Lang focused.com/swedish. Oh God.

265
00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:40.390
It's one of the most extensive Swedish courses I've ever seen with literally

266
00:15:40.391 --> 00:15:44.290
hundreds of lessons for learners of any level and the lessons get progressively

267
00:15:44.291 --> 00:15:48.700
more challenging as your level improves as the name suggests they're podcast

268
00:15:48.701 --> 00:15:49.534
based lessons,

269
00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:53.470
which is great for people who like to learn using audio materials and for people

270
00:15:53.471 --> 00:15:55.420
who want to learn on the go these days,

271
00:15:55.421 --> 00:15:59.590
I try to focus much more on audio materials than I used to so that I can repeat

272
00:15:59.591 --> 00:16:03.730
new words and phrases to improve my pronunciation. And at a more advanced level,

273
00:16:03.731 --> 00:16:06.160
I shadow entire dialogues or monologues,

274
00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.850
but pod one Oh one courses offer more than just audio lessons.

275
00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.470
They have lots of video lessons,

276
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:16.210
as well as downloadable books and PDF materials so that you can get visual input

277
00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.210
and explanations of all the language introduced in the lessons.

278
00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:23.110
They also have audio recordings of the individual words and phrases.

279
00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:27.250
So you can review them individually and you can create vocabulary flashcards

280
00:16:27.251 --> 00:16:30.640
that you spaced repetitions to help you memorize the words more easily.

281
00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:33.670
They also offer quizzes to help you review the lessons,

282
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.970
word lists of the most commonly used words and other features.

283
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.720
Now the biggest problem most learners seem to have with innovative language

284
00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:42.970
courses is that the lessons are short.

285
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.630
So they make the mistake of breezing through them too quickly and moving onto

286
00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:47.464
the next lesson.

287
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:51.070
But I really recommend that you slow down and you practice what you learn in

288
00:16:51.071 --> 00:16:53.230
each lesson before moving onto the next one.

289
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:56.650
You can listen to the lesson multiple times, review the lesson,

290
00:16:56.651 --> 00:16:58.030
transcript and notes,

291
00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:02.140
use the flashcards and test yourself either by yourself or using the systems

292
00:17:02.141 --> 00:17:04.990
built in quizzes. That's where the real learning takes place.

293
00:17:04.991 --> 00:17:07.330
When you reinforce and review what you've learned,

294
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:11.200
I've never learned a language using only innovative language courses,

295
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.420
but I'm a member of several of their sites.

296
00:17:13.421 --> 00:17:17.650
And I regularly use them as part of my study. Lots of content is free,

297
00:17:17.651 --> 00:17:21.070
including all new lessons, which are free for the first couple of weeks.

298
00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:23.620
And then if you want to access all the content,

299
00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:25.270
you can upgrade to a paid account.

300
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:28.510
I really recommend you check out innovative languages courses,

301
00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.420
whether for Swedish or one of the other 33 languages,

302
00:17:31.421 --> 00:17:35.440
they offer click the link in the description to get a free lifetime account.

303
00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:39.850
I also want to give a big shout out to all the Lang focus, Patrion supporters,
