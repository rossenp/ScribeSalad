<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.540
<v 1>That's going to be difficult, work on the new letter.</v>

3
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.203
<v 0>Okay.</v>

4
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.980
<v 1>All right. It's good evening, everyone. Or good morning or good afternoon,</v>

5
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.020
whatever it is, wherever you are. I actually can't see my own stream,

6
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.240
but I can hear my voice through the headphones. So, so I know you can hear me.

7
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.490
So let me take this off. So I don't hear an echo. Uh, okay. Yeah.

8
00:01:40.491 --> 00:01:43.940
I don't know how I can see my own stream. I can't see the comments right now.

9
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.910
I can't see anything. Let me, um, give me a minute.

10
00:01:46.911 --> 00:01:49.730
Let me try to figure that out. Uh, hold on a second.

11
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.070
I want to see your comments while I'm streaming.

12
00:01:52.071 --> 00:01:55.850
So let me try to figure out how to find it. I haven't done this in a long time.

13
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.240
It's been about two years since I've done a live stream.

14
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.983
We'll do this.

15
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.883
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

16
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.120
<v 1>I don't mean to keep you waiting.</v>

17
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.200
I just want to be able to see the comments in this doesn't seem the same as last

18
00:02:21.201 --> 00:02:24.710
time a YouTube has changed something.

19
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.540
I've got to figure out the new way, or at least you can see me and hear me.

20
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.520
Um, if I can't figure out how to, how to see the actual stream,

21
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.220
then I'll just do it and, uh,

22
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.970
let you guys listen and watch and just hope that everything's going fine.

23
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.053
<v 0>Okay.</v>

24
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.150
<v 1>Okay. I'm going to try to, to watch it on my own phone,</v>

25
00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.400
because that seems to be the only way I can get to my own stream.

26
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.280
YouTube. What are you doing while you're playing with me?

27
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.450
So I'm actually using my phone and searching for my own channel so I can see my

28
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:13.060
own screen, my own stream. This is getting weird.

29
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.830
Okay. Well good. Okay.

30
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.440
Now the wrong thumbnail is there.

31
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.700
It also has the wrong thumbnail. Okay.

32
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.710
Now I can see my own stream and I can see the comments on the screen.

33
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.230
Okay. All right.

34
00:03:37.231 --> 00:03:42.090
So I see someone from Brazil. What's up Brazil. I see Holland. Uh,

35
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.590
let's see. Someone said you are weird. Indeed. You are correct. That is true.

36
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.610
She led what's up. I know you'll, you'll be, um,

37
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.600
extremely annoyed if I call it chili. So it's chili

38
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.770
Czech Republic. Someone said I'm getting old. Well,

39
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.620
when do you expect five years have passed since the start

40
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.590
Afghanistan. Cool. Switzerland, Germany, Italy,

41
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.970
Egypt, India, Brazil. Uh,

42
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.820
alright, well, I should, um,

43
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.230
get started actually speaking to you guys and not just shouting out all the

44
00:04:22.231 --> 00:04:25.530
different countries and getting oriented. Sorry.

45
00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:29.970
It took me so long to figure out how to actually see the stream. Um,

46
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.890
crazy times. Uh,

47
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.090
the world is crazy right now because of all the stuff that's going on with the

48
00:04:36.091 --> 00:04:39.030
coronavirus and people under lockdown.

49
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.560
I know a lot of you are stuck at home and you can't go to work, uh,

50
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.210
or you can't go to school. Um, or maybe you're doing teleworking from home.

51
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.440
Maybe you're doing online classes for your university or your high school or

52
00:04:52.441 --> 00:04:53.850
whatever. Um,

53
00:04:53.851 --> 00:04:58.680
so a lot of people are stuck at home and just having a hard time adjusting

54
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.020
to this new reality. So I thought I'd talk a little bit about that today and,

55
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.530
um, talk about how you can sort of, um,

56
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.820
be happy and healthy when you're stuck at home when you're not used to that.

57
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.960
And then also how you can use that time. Well, you can use it productively, um,

58
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.340
to learn or to improve yourself, improve your life. So let me just, um,

59
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.330
let me get into it and, um, let's start going.

60
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.150
So, um, about being happy and healthy at home.

61
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.400
So I'm kind of used to staying at home a lot because I do Lang

62
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.280
focus. I work on Lang focus for long hours at home.

63
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.610
I don't work at Starbucks or in an office or things like that.

64
00:05:41.611 --> 00:05:42.750
I usually do it at home.

65
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.850
So I'm kind of used to just being at home a lot and I've had to learn how to not

66
00:05:47.851 --> 00:05:49.470
go crazy and, um,

67
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.120
learn how to be productive and just also feel good when I'm at home.

68
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.430
So these are my thoughts on how to be happy and healthy at home.

69
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.730
Um, it's easy to get bored and it's also easy to get depressed when you're at

70
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:07.910
home all the time when you're not seeing anything new, um,

71
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.020
when you can't get out of the house very much and, uh, for a change of pace,

72
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.060
um, depression's very common when people are stuck at home. Um,

73
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.290
so some things you can do,

74
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.520
one of the most important things to do is to exercise by the way,

75
00:06:22.521 --> 00:06:24.920
these are all just, you know, this might be obvious,

76
00:06:24.921 --> 00:06:26.660
but these are just things that, um,

77
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.120
I think are important and things that I try to do.

78
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.370
So I'm encouraging other people to do them too.

79
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.220
So exercise exercise is important,

80
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.070
not just for like looking ripped and looking good,

81
00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:40.700
it's it is to maintain your physical health and to maintain your mood.

82
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.740
And that's a part of it that not everyone really thinks about exercising

83
00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:48.920
improves, your mood, gets your blood flowing. Um,

84
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.360
it just helps you to feel better. And if you're getting depressed, um,

85
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.770
exercise is a very good way to alleviate that. And that's an important thing.

86
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.460
If you're stuck at home a lot, I've been exercising every morning.

87
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.310
I normally do anyway. Um, but I,

88
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.230
I made sure to buy some exercise equipment and get on top of exercising at home,

89
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:13.160
uh, during this semi lockdown period, you're in Japan.

90
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.450
We're not fully under lockdown, but, um, we're not supposed to go out that much.

91
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.290
And I haven't been going out very much at all. Only it's the supermarket really?

92
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.670
So you can exercise at home with equipment or without equipment.

93
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:29.390
I have some equipment, I have some dumbbells and I bought a pull-up rack.

94
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.620
So I've been doing pull ups and chin ups and, um, and dips on the pull-up rack.

95
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.760
And I've been doing push-ups and sit-ups um, but you don't need equipment.

96
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.180
There are a lot of things you can do without equipment. If you can do pushups,

97
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.600
sit ups, you can do leg raises, you can do squats,

98
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:49.130
you can do squats while you're holding something. I hold dumbbells when I do it.

99
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:53.030
But, um, some people hold cartons of milk or they hold, you know,

100
00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.270
boxes or whatever. You can hold something to increase the weight.

101
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.700
So it's more like you're doing squats at the gym,

102
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.990
even though it's probably not quite as heavy. Um,

103
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.750
so the goal is not to be jacked or ripped, right?

104
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.420
It's to get your blood flowing and increase your heart rate.

105
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.540
So even if you don't have the best equipment in the world,

106
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:15.110
it's not like your gym, at least you still have, um,

107
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.230
you still have something and you still have a chance to get your blood flowing

108
00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:22.610
and feel better. So it's really about being healthy, both physically and man.

109
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:25.810
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

110
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:29.340
<v 1>Okay. It's exercise. That's one thing that I think is important too,</v>

111
00:08:29.341 --> 00:08:32.320
to keep doing, even when you're stuck at home,

112
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:37.210
the second thing is strive to be productive.

113
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.510
Don't just consume by consume. I mean,

114
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.750
like you just take something in like you watch TV or you,

115
00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:48.070
you use social media or you listen to music that's consuming,

116
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:52.360
but it's much more, uh, it's much better for you if you are productive,

117
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:53.410
if you produce.

118
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.460
<v 2>So, um.</v>

119
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.620
<v 1>Yeah, if you only consume entertainment,</v>

120
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:03.120
it's much easier to start feeling a sense of despair. Um,

121
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:08.190
because you're basically sitting there passively and you're not really taking

122
00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:11.190
control of anything. So especially in a situation like this,

123
00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:15.150
where we feel so helpless and like things are out of our control,

124
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:19.320
it's much better to be productive because you, um,

125
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.100
you feel like you're moving forward and you are actually taking control and

126
00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:26.430
moving forward and progressing beyond this current situation.

127
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.650
So that's very good for your,

128
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:33.300
your mental health and just your mood in this sort of situation. Uh,

129
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.650
I skipped one line here. Uh,

130
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.440
social media can be terrible for your mental health.

131
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.080
So that's part of consumption these days.

132
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.130
Most people consume a lot of social media and it's starting to replace TV a

133
00:09:44.131 --> 00:09:44.964
little bit,

134
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.410
but social media is not very good for our mental health in a lot of ways.

135
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.350
I mean, dealing with the comments, there's a lot of, um,

136
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:57.240
sort of conflict in the comments and a lot of, um, people get angry and it's,

137
00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:01.680
it's easy to argue with people and then you feel bad when you argue and that

138
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:04.620
kind of thing. And then there's all of the, the comparisons, you know,

139
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:08.850
comparing yourself to other people and how they portray their lives on social

140
00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:12.840
media, all of that stuff when you're stuck at home and you,

141
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:18.300
you probably consume more of that than it's even worse for your mental state.

142
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.660
So avoid all of that consumption, consumption, um,

143
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.070
think about working on a skill or developing a skill because that gives you that

144
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.450
sense of mission and progress. So maybe I'm stating the obvious,

145
00:10:30.451 --> 00:10:34.140
but I'm just sort of telling you my thoughts and showing you that I care.

146
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.630
So one obvious choice, uh, one obvious mission that you can,

147
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.720
that you can take up is to learn a language.

148
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.380
Obviously you're all language enthusiasts. That's why you watch this channel,

149
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.400
but it doesn't have to be learning a language, just do something productive,

150
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:55.050
just so you feel happier and feel that sense of satisfaction and progress.

151
00:10:55.051 --> 00:10:57.450
And you don't get depressed when you're stuck at home.

152
00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:00.780
Okay.

153
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:05.760
So here are some general ideas for how to be productive and how to focus when

154
00:11:05.761 --> 00:11:08.760
you're at home. This is not only about language learning.

155
00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:12.120
I'll get to some specifics about languages later, but right now,

156
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:16.290
just in general, how can you stay focused and be productive at home?

157
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.510
Because it's not easy at first. Um,

158
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:23.370
I work at a university I teach during the semester, but I have long breaks.

159
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.340
This break that I'm on now is normally three months.

160
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.470
So the first month when I'm off,

161
00:11:28.471 --> 00:11:32.400
it's usually a big shock to my system and I have to, uh,

162
00:11:32.401 --> 00:11:36.270
adjust and figure out how to focus again when I'm at home for such a long period

163
00:11:36.271 --> 00:11:39.930
of time. So I'm kind of used to this, to here are my ideas on that.

164
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:45.240
So the first idea is to have a specific place that is your productive place.

165
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:50.340
Um, so I have this little office room right here, maybe. Um,

166
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:54.280
let me skip back so you can see I'm on scene 15. Okay. Uh,

167
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.730
let me go back for a second. So I have this little office room right here,

168
00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.510
where I use the computer for editing and for doing research and stuff.

169
00:12:01.511 --> 00:12:06.010
This is my productive space. So when I'm not being productive,

170
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.510
when I'm using the computer for something, something fun or for consumption,

171
00:12:10.511 --> 00:12:12.640
then I take the computer into the other room.

172
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.700
I go sit at the kitchen table or sit on the sofa.

173
00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:20.770
I try to divide those places into productive and unproductive place.

174
00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.610
I have one particular place to be productive. Um, when you do that,

175
00:12:24.611 --> 00:12:28.180
you start to associate that place with productivity.

176
00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:33.670
So if you, uh, use that place for unproductive activities,

177
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.840
then you'll start to connect that place with that unproductive stuff.

178
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.220
So it'll be harder to get into the zone and focus when you want to be

179
00:12:42.221 --> 00:12:45.730
productive. So have one place set aside for that for me,

180
00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:49.930
it's this room right here. Second thing. Now, this thing is, um,

181
00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:54.610
something, some people are kind of cynical about, which is meditation.

182
00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:00.280
Now. I don't mean like spiritual or religious meditation. Uh,

183
00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.350
not like that. What I mean is just, um,

184
00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:07.420
sort of relaxation and breathing exercise to calm down, um,

185
00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.570
to relax your body and clear your mind. Um,

186
00:13:10.571 --> 00:13:14.470
it clears the mind and it prevents distraction. Um,

187
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:16.450
if you're,

188
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:20.530
if you want to work for a few hours and you just spend like five minutes at the

189
00:13:20.531 --> 00:13:22.960
beginning, meditating, then it's much,

190
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:27.640
much easier just to get started and to focus. And you don't have all of these,

191
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.540
um, these random thoughts and ideas popping into your head.

192
00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.850
And if they're there, they're quiet and in the background,

193
00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.050
they're not that distracting.

194
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.320
And you don't think about things like I'm going to check your,

195
00:13:38.321 --> 00:13:42.190
your smartphone or, you know, all of the other things that you want to do later.

196
00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:46.540
You don't think about them as much. If you spend five, 10 or 20 minutes,

197
00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:49.270
meditating, 20 minutes is a bit hardcore,

198
00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:52.240
but 10 minutes you can do that. That's great.

199
00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:55.870
Or even five minutes or just two or three minutes, uh, to start.

200
00:13:56.350 --> 00:14:01.060
So what I do to meditate is I just focus on my breathing and I

201
00:14:01.061 --> 00:14:06.040
focus on a candle. So let me go back again and just go back to the scene.

202
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:10.780
I have little candles like this and in my productivity room and my little office

203
00:14:10.781 --> 00:14:12.130
right here, um,

204
00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:17.470
I like this candle and I just stare at the flame while I breathe slowly and

205
00:14:17.471 --> 00:14:19.660
focus on my breathing and that's it.

206
00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.500
And maybe my mind will drift off and think about something else.

207
00:14:23.501 --> 00:14:25.450
But when I notice my mind is drifting,

208
00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:29.800
then I just bring my attention back to the candle flame and to my breathing.

209
00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.820
So it's basically two points of awareness, my breath and the candle.

210
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:38.320
So if I do that for about five minutes, 10 minutes, sometimes 20,

211
00:14:38.321 --> 00:14:43.150
if I'm doing it consistently, then that keeps me focused for hours at a time.

212
00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.750
Then if I get distracted again later, I can pause and, uh,

213
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.860
and meditate for a few minutes again. And just to get my attention back,

214
00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.950
I find it really good for clearing the mind. Uh, where were we? Okay,

215
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:56.120
so that was point number two.

216
00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:02.030
Another idea is to put your phone in the other room,

217
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:07.460
put your phone in the other room. Um, we have an impulse to, well,

218
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.560
let me backtrack for a minute. Um,

219
00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:14.150
most of us these days are really addicted to our phones and we always have this

220
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:18.050
impulse to pick up the phone and to check our, um,

221
00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.300
check our messages or look at Instagram.

222
00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.530
What we're really doing is seeking stimulation, uh,

223
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.960
because you get that stimulation that dopamine hit.

224
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.120
Whenever you pick up your phone and you, you see something new,

225
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.860
your phones are designed to, to be like that designed to be addictive.

226
00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:37.430
We're all kind of addicted to them. But if you put it in the other room,

227
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:42.620
then it's out of reach and you're less likely to pick it up

228
00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:45.530
because we have that impulse to pick up the phone,

229
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:49.250
but we have a different impulse to stay seated where we are.

230
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.520
So if you're sitting down, you usually don't want to stand up.

231
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:56.330
You'd rather just stay seated because it's easier when you're in that sort of

232
00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:57.980
passive state to sitting in your seat.

233
00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:01.790
So you can use that tendency of wanting to sit.

234
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:04.820
You can use that to prevent yourself from picking up your phone.

235
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:08.420
So it's put your phone in the other room and you probably won't go and pick it

236
00:16:08.421 --> 00:16:11.840
up. And if you do well, it will probably be later than you.

237
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:14.990
You would have done it. Otherwise let's put your phone in the other room.

238
00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:20.020
It works. Okay. I just said that.

239
00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:25.390
Okay. And if you do use your phone for something productive, um, uh,

240
00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.590
for example, if you use the, um, like On-key and SRS,

241
00:16:29.591 --> 00:16:34.000
a language learning app, or if you do some kind of work using your phone,

242
00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:37.960
then avoid the junk. Try not to use Facebook,

243
00:16:37.961 --> 00:16:42.640
try not to use Instagram, um, avoid those as much as you can. Um,

244
00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:44.860
but then again, we're addicted.

245
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:49.030
So what can we do if we're addicted and we can't help ourselves? Well,

246
00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.570
there's a social media hack. This is what I do. Um,

247
00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:57.670
I load my timeline with productive content so that even if I

248
00:16:57.671 --> 00:17:02.260
open it, I don't really waste time. So for me, what that means is on Facebook,

249
00:17:02.261 --> 00:17:05.320
for example, I only follow stuff that's in different languages.

250
00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:10.720
Like I read the news and Indonesian or watch videos from CNN, Indonesia, or,

251
00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:13.780
you know, I subscribe to TV channels and Israel,

252
00:17:13.781 --> 00:17:18.580
so I can watch TV shows in Hebrew. Uh, I get the news and French.

253
00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:22.630
So that's, that's my whole timeline these days. So even if I,

254
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:25.360
I do open Facebook in a moment of weakness,

255
00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:28.180
then it's fine because I'm actually doing something productive.

256
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:30.250
So that's the social media hack.

257
00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:35.230
Just prevent yourself from wasting time looking at funny cat videos

258
00:17:35.231 --> 00:17:38.620
or whatever, but loading your timeline with stuff that's useful for you.

259
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:46.300
Okay. Uh, another idea, this is an idea, um,

260
00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:47.770
for procrastination,

261
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:52.200
this is a mental hack for how to mentally get over procrastination.

262
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:58.170
Most people do useless things first and put off their productive work for

263
00:17:58.171 --> 00:18:02.580
as long as they can. So switch those things. You can still do both,

264
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:06.440
but switch them. Uh, so what I mean, what,

265
00:18:06.441 --> 00:18:11.310
let me go back to the I'll show you my, my space here again.

266
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:15.750
So most people usually do the unproductive activities first,

267
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:18.690
and then they do the productive activities later.

268
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:23.070
They put those off as long as possible or I'll study later, or, um, you know,

269
00:18:23.071 --> 00:18:25.200
I'll do my work later and they keep putting it off,

270
00:18:25.201 --> 00:18:29.610
over and over and they do the fun stuff first. So switch those,

271
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:34.350
switch your focus to, to the productive stuff. Tell yourself, okay,

272
00:18:34.351 --> 00:18:38.010
I'm going to do this fun, this productive stuff right now. The fun stuff. Okay.

273
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.860
Yeah. Well, I'll do it sometime. I'll do that later. Not yet. I'll just,

274
00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.710
I'll do it sometime. Not yet.

275
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.370
Just keep putting it off the way you would normally put off your work.

276
00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.010
You would put, normally put off your productive activities.

277
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:54.480
So switch that and put off the fun stuff or the unproductive stuff.

278
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.180
Just do that sometime in the future later,

279
00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.760
and then keep telling yourself that every time, if you want to do it,

280
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:04.230
tell yourself later, later, maybe tomorrow, or maybe tonight,

281
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:09.420
every time you have the impulse to do it, push that back into the ends of the,

282
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.000
uh, yeah. Push it off into the future. Sorry.

283
00:19:12.001 --> 00:19:16.230
It's late here and I'm kind of tired. So I'm, uh, getting off track of it.

284
00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:18.691
Uh, okay. Right.

285
00:19:18.691 --> 00:19:23.670
So switch the focus from the unproductive activities to the productive

286
00:19:23.671 --> 00:19:26.640
ones, push the unproductive ones often to the future,

287
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:31.920
as far as you can keep pushing it back. Okay. Let me find the slide where,

288
00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:37.560
where I was. I forgot what slide I'm on social media. We already passed that.

289
00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:42.570
Okay. Switch them here we are.

290
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.300
Okay. So those are some ideas for productivity in general,

291
00:19:48.301 --> 00:19:50.760
for how to stay focused at home. Um,

292
00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:55.650
now for learning a language at home specifically, here are some ideas.

293
00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:00.690
People tell me, well, I can't go out and speak to people, right? Um,

294
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.810
but now we have the internet. So you don't exactly need to,

295
00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.050
you can do an online language exchange.

296
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:12.030
And right now lots of people are at home. So they're bored too. They have,

297
00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.710
you know, lots of time on their hands.

298
00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.860
So it's probably easier to find language partners at the moment.

299
00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.880
So if you actually look for some, you could probably find them.

300
00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:24.090
You might find some in the chat right now, who knows. Um,

301
00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:27.210
but if you join one of those sites, like, um, like I,

302
00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:31.320
talkie is one where you can find Landry language exchange partners. Um,

303
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.410
there are apps like, hello, talk and that sort of thing,

304
00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:37.980
where you can find language exchange partners. That's a good idea.

305
00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:40.560
And then you can jump on Skype and you can actually talk to them,

306
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:43.110
Skype or zoom or whatever you use. Um,

307
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:46.830
you can actually meet them and speak to them online,

308
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.290
just like a real language exchange partner. So that's one idea.

309
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.910
Another thing is another thing you can do is to take online lessons.

310
00:20:55.420 --> 00:21:00.130
You can use a site like I talking to book lessons on Skype or whatever. Um,

311
00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:02.410
and then talk to them on Skype.

312
00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:05.620
I talk to you is usually it's not always informal,

313
00:21:05.621 --> 00:21:08.440
but the focus tends to be on informal tutoring.

314
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:13.180
So it's a way to get conversation, practice and get some feedback, uh,

315
00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:17.440
about your, about the way you're speaking about your, your skills.

316
00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.260
Uh, if you want to take more serious lessons,

317
00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:23.860
then there's stuff like lingo data, or there are language schools like, um,

318
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.710
there was another one live lingua, I think is another one.

319
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.880
There are online language schools that actually provide courses for you.

320
00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:34.600
So that's another option. If you want something that's more laid out for you,

321
00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:39.070
but I usually use, I talkie it unless it's a language that I'm,

322
00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:40.360
I'm just beginning it.

323
00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:46.060
So here are some ideas for how to get started on your own. Using,

324
00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:49.600
I talked to you doing a language exchange. That's usually, you know,

325
00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:53.230
when you already know a little bit of the language and you want to apply what

326
00:21:53.231 --> 00:21:57.430
you you've been studying to, you get some conversation practice. Um,

327
00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:58.960
but what if you're just starting out?

328
00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:02.170
What if you are bored at home and you want to pick up a new language? Well,

329
00:22:02.171 --> 00:22:04.930
here are some ideas to get started. Um,

330
00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:09.010
different people do it differently and maybe these aren't revolutionary,

331
00:22:09.011 --> 00:22:11.590
but these are some ideas in case you don't know what to do.

332
00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:15.220
So you can get started by listening to the language a lot,

333
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.470
just getting used to the sounds of the language.

334
00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.940
You can listen to YouTube videos, you can listen to podcasts. And by that,

335
00:22:21.941 --> 00:22:26.680
I mean, podcasts in that native speakers. That's a good way to, to get,

336
00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.950
uh, to get used to the sounds of the language so that later on,

337
00:22:29.951 --> 00:22:33.940
you can imitate them and be able to understand them because you're learning to

338
00:22:33.941 --> 00:22:36.190
distinguish between all the different sounds.

339
00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:40.060
And after you've done some of that,

340
00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.460
you've gotten used to the sound of the language.

341
00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:46.210
Then you can use a course with audio. So my course,

342
00:22:46.211 --> 00:22:51.010
I don't mean like apps. Um, there are internet based courses that are good.

343
00:22:51.011 --> 00:22:55.300
I'm sure I'm more familiar with the book and audio courses, uh,

344
00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:59.920
that were, that were big when, when I was younger, because I got used to those.

345
00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:04.810
So, you know, I like courses like, um, teach yourself as, okay. I like,

346
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:09.490
um, uh, lingua phone, the old lingo phone courses, um, stuff like that.

347
00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:14.380
There were a lot of different, uh, audio and book courses that are quite good.

348
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:18.160
Another one is, um, living language. It's another one. Um,

349
00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:19.570
but worked through the course,

350
00:23:19.571 --> 00:23:23.920
work through the book and listen to the audio a lot and also shadow the audio.

351
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:27.850
I'm quite big on shadowing. I think that's a great way to, um,

352
00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:30.700
to learn how to pronounce the language. Um,

353
00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.870
and also you're also internalizing some of the sentence patterns when you're

354
00:23:34.871 --> 00:23:39.370
shadowing them and that sort of thing I've found, uh, shadowing very helpful.

355
00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:44.700
It's something I've been really into the past couple of years. Uh,

356
00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:45.563
and you can,

357
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:49.160
so you have that main course and you work through it with the book and the

358
00:23:49.161 --> 00:23:51.650
audio, but you can also supplement with other materials,

359
00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.240
like a pod one Oh one site,

360
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:57.830
or with lessons on YouTube that are dedicated to learners of your target

361
00:23:57.831 --> 00:23:59.180
language, that kind of thing.

362
00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:03.560
It's always good to have some extra materials just to, for extra stimulation,

363
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:07.070
just to make your learning journey more exciting for you.

364
00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:12.080
And you get all that extra exposure to the language. Um,

365
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:15.350
and it's always from a different angle or maybe the topics of different and that

366
00:24:15.351 --> 00:24:17.930
kind of thing. It's always good to have multiple sources

367
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.070
and then you can speak with people to apply it.

368
00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.910
So that brings us back to I talk to your language exchanges.

369
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:31.790
So that's kind of for beginners, I guess, for people who are getting started,

370
00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:35.750
but what if you're more advanced? There are a couple of things, um, you know,

371
00:24:35.751 --> 00:24:36.770
a couple of things you can do,

372
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:41.240
you can consume content in that language consume content.

373
00:24:41.241 --> 00:24:43.370
That's a fancy way of saying like, you know,

374
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:48.320
listen to audio and watch videos and that kind of thing consume content just

375
00:24:48.321 --> 00:24:52.220
means that so you can, uh, you can, you know,

376
00:24:52.221 --> 00:24:56.450
listen to podcasts, you can watch Netflix shows in your target language.

377
00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:59.360
You can read the news in your target language, that kind of thing.

378
00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:02.840
So that content, that authentic content becomes your textbook.

379
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:05.180
You can learn the vocabulary,

380
00:25:05.181 --> 00:25:09.620
you need to understand a video or a news article or that show, uh,

381
00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:14.240
or a novel, if that's what you want to do. And then that becomes your textbook.

382
00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:18.800
You focus on that content and you learn whatever you need to learn in order to

383
00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:23.900
understand that content. Oh, wow. I just, um, I'm just, I'm just seeing,

384
00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:27.140
um, I'm looking off to the, sorry,

385
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.530
I'm distracted by my phone. Uh,

386
00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:34.670
let me go back to, to my office right here.

387
00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.670
If you're just tuning in, uh,

388
00:25:37.671 --> 00:25:41.910
I should let you know that I can't really see what's going on in the stream. Uh,

389
00:25:41.911 --> 00:25:45.680
I can't see it on the computer. So I had to open up my cell phone.

390
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:50.120
My iPhone is right here on the side. So if you're sending, if you're sending,

391
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:53.180
um, super chats or whatever, I might not see them.

392
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:55.160
Maybe I didn't see some of the earlier ones,

393
00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.630
but like I see this one here at the $20 one. This is from VK. He says,

394
00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:03.230
love your videos. Use them in my introductory linguistics classes.

395
00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:06.860
Thank you for what you do. And thank you, Sue. Thank you very much VK.

396
00:26:06.861 --> 00:26:08.450
I appreciate that. Uh,

397
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:12.680
I appreciate the super chat and I appreciate that you're sharing my videos and

398
00:26:12.681 --> 00:26:17.300
I'm really happy that you, uh, find them that valuable. Um,

399
00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:21.080
the audio is low. Let me see. Um, hold on a second.

400
00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.750
Did the audio just drop out now?

401
00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:27.610
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

402
00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:31.630
<v 1>Did the audio just drop out now? Uh, or was it like, was it low the whole time?</v>

403
00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:35.470
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

404
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:38.890
<v 1>So what happened was my headphones were really loud,</v>

405
00:26:38.891 --> 00:26:43.150
so I turned them off and maybe that interfered with the microphone

406
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.880
you got is fine. Okay, good, good, good. I just,

407
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:52.740
I see some comments off to the side on my iPhone. Okay.

408
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:58.170
Um, let me see. I think that was the last slide actually. Oh, I had one more.

409
00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:03.150
So the content becomes your textbook when you're dealing with authentic content

410
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.590
as your textbook, but you can also take part in the comments.

411
00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:09.960
That's one of the great things about social media.

412
00:27:09.961 --> 00:27:14.370
If you're using it for productive purposes, that you can take part and, uh,

413
00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:19.350
and you can engage with people. So if there's an interesting news article, uh,

414
00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:20.213
you can,

415
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.760
you can comment on it and you can respond to other comments in the target

416
00:27:23.761 --> 00:27:28.440
language. And that becomes quite fun. And it's like a memorable experience.

417
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:33.000
It's just like having a conversation with someone in the target language.

418
00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:36.840
It's more memorable than studying in your textbook because you're engaging with

419
00:27:36.841 --> 00:27:41.070
a real person. So that gives you that, um, more valuable, um,

420
00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:45.780
more relevant memory that will help you remember the language that you use.

421
00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.960
So it's really a good experience to, to take part in the comments,

422
00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:53.970
if you have no one to actually speak to face-to-face. Okay.

423
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.530
So those are my ideas. Um, maybe they're, they're basic ideas.

424
00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.970
There's nothing revolutionary there,

425
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.350
but I just wanted to share some ideas about what you can do at home.

426
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:07.920
If you're stuck under lockdown or semi locked down,

427
00:28:07.921 --> 00:28:10.350
or you are not comfortable going out that much.

428
00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:15.330
So it's a time that we can use to be more productive. Um, you know, it's not,

429
00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:19.500
it's not a good situation, but at the very least,

430
00:28:19.501 --> 00:28:23.910
maybe we can just make use of that time so that it's not an entirely bad

431
00:28:23.911 --> 00:28:24.744
situation.

432
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:28.890
So let me have a look at the comments and let's see if there's anything more

433
00:28:28.891 --> 00:28:32.190
that, that I can respond to here. Um,

434
00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.420
I'm looking at them on my phone and they, the fly by rapidly.

435
00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:38.550
So I'll just try to catch a few comments here and there.

436
00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:44.570
<v 0>Wow. Does he go on a fast?</v>

437
00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.960
<v 1>Okay. I can scroll back. Uh, I can scroll back and see the,</v>

438
00:28:52.961 --> 00:28:56.210
the earlier comments too. That's good. So I don't lose them entirely.

439
00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:02.270
I wish I knew how to see the actual stream on the computer, on the PC screen,

440
00:29:02.271 --> 00:29:04.820
because it's much bigger and easier to find comments.

441
00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:06.043
<v 0>Yes.</v>

442
00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:12.440
<v 1>Someone says, I love your videos and you and deed I'd asked for.</v>

443
00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:16.520
What did you say? I'd asked you about a video of Slovak.

444
00:29:16.521 --> 00:29:21.050
Do you know anything about, do you know anything about it? Uh, Slovak? Well,

445
00:29:21.051 --> 00:29:25.280
I know it's a Slavic language, but I don't know a lot about it specifically.

446
00:29:25.281 --> 00:29:29.150
I'd have to look into it. Paul,

447
00:29:29.151 --> 00:29:32.180
do you recommend native subtitles for super beginners?

448
00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:38.750
Super beginners? Well, I'm have,

449
00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.680
I have to think about that for a second for super beginner subtitles.

450
00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:44.530
So you mean like if you're watching a movie in French,

451
00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:49.540
should you turn on the French subtitles if you're a complete beginner? Yeah,

452
00:29:49.541 --> 00:29:54.370
I think there's value in that. Um, but it depends. It depends. I mean it,

453
00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:59.260
because sometimes there are very simple conversations in TV shows and movies.

454
00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.770
So you might pick up on some basic readings and, um,

455
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:06.430
just a few basic words here and there, you know, good morning, how are you?

456
00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:11.050
What are you doing? Things like that. Um, but at the same time,

457
00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:16.000
movies and TV shows have a lot of language. That's not very natural. It's,

458
00:30:16.001 --> 00:30:18.880
it's sort of crafted to be extra interesting.

459
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:22.690
So a lot of the things they say are not really good examples of how people

460
00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:27.580
actually speak. So, uh, it can't be good. It's not bad.

461
00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:34.020
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

462
00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:38.850
<v 1>Let me see. Repent everyone. The wrath of God is nearby. Cool.</v>

463
00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:42.690
Um, link focus. You can open a different tab with the stream open. Yeah,

464
00:30:42.691 --> 00:30:44.970
I tried that, but let me, let me try it again. Let's see.

465
00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:52.140
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

466
00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:55.080
<v 1>Someone asked what are the Kyushu dialects like, uh,</v>

467
00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:57.930
compared to the Osaka and Tokyo dialects, to be honest,

468
00:30:57.931 --> 00:31:02.280
I don't know that much about, um, QSU dialects. Um,

469
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:05.760
yeah, I haven't spent that much time in Kyushu,

470
00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:08.070
so I don't really know a lot about them.

471
00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:18.420
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

472
00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:21.270
<v 1>Uh, someone said Paul, the microphone you're using a site address.</v>

473
00:31:21.271 --> 00:31:24.090
You should speak into the side of it for better audio quality.

474
00:31:24.091 --> 00:31:28.950
I believe there's a blue led light, uh, led on sentence side. Okay.

475
00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:33.360
This is, um, Samsung meteor mic. Uh,

476
00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.110
so I should speak into the side. There's a blue light on it.

477
00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:39.203
I have to figure this out.

478
00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:48.480
I'll look more into this for next time. Now it's actually falling off the table.

479
00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:52.440
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

480
00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.290
<v 1>Sorry. I win the award for most unprepared live stream today.</v>

481
00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:01.830
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

482
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:04.830
<v 1>Oh my God. I have no fun stuff to post on Facebook. Okay.</v>

483
00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:08.250
Well only serious stuff. Only serious stuff.

484
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:11.700
Well, Facebook is a nightmare.

485
00:32:11.701 --> 00:32:14.850
If you post only serious stuff or read serious stuff,

486
00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.920
I installed an app on Facebook that blocks the word Trump,

487
00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:24.450
because I saw nothing, but people fighting about Trump all the time.

488
00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:28.350
And that's a whole massive distraction. I don't want to think about it.

489
00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:34.590
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

490
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:35.011
<v 1>Hey, Paul,</v>

491
00:32:35.011 --> 00:32:39.830
my book cheers about toasting in 80 foreign languages and about culture is

492
00:32:39.831 --> 00:32:44.690
being published next spring. Cheers. That sounds cool. It's about toasting.

493
00:32:44.691 --> 00:32:47.960
How to toast in different languages. Hm. Interesting.

494
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:55.280
Yeah. I want to ask someone, um, I asked them, how do you toast in Arabic?

495
00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:59.450
Because I thought, Hmm. In predominantly Muslim cultures,

496
00:32:59.451 --> 00:33:03.410
maybe they don't actually have a word for the toast because they don't drink

497
00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:07.280
alcohol or at least, you know, it's more conservative.

498
00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:11.000
People don't drink alcohol. Someone told me, they say handle ULI,

499
00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:15.080
but I don't know if that's correct or not. So if someone knows,

500
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:16.850
please write that in the comments. I want to know.

501
00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.153
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

502
00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.380
<v 1>Uh, someone said, what's your favorite place in Japan?</v>

503
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:31.870
My favorite place in Japan? Well, it's a two-part answer. Uh,

504
00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:36.100
I love Osaka because I've lived here for a long time. So it's basically my home,

505
00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:41.530
but I also love Tokyo because Tokyo is, Oh,

506
00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:45.010
we're back. Okay. Camera died for a second. What's up with that?

507
00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:51.250
Okay. And the notice the notification was in Japanese,

508
00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:56.020
I guess that's geo-targeting they know what country I'm in. Yeah. Um,

509
00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:59.260
Tokyo is where all the action's at. That's where, you know,

510
00:33:59.261 --> 00:34:03.640
a lot of my good friends live, uh, friends with both Osaka and Tokyo,

511
00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:09.220
but Tokyo is awesome because there's just so much going on there. Um, Insta,

512
00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:13.570
a lot of people there are doing cool stuff, starting businesses and,

513
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:15.430
um,

514
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:20.140
working in jobs that most of the international community and all soccer are not

515
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:24.280
working in most of the international community and Osaka movies,

516
00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:26.590
Westerners they're teaching. Right.

517
00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:30.490
But in Tokyo you get people doing all sorts of different work and, um,

518
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:34.300
yeah, it can be inspiring and interesting.

519
00:34:34.301 --> 00:34:37.150
It's exciting to meet people who are doing something different.

520
00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:41.560
So I like Alyssa that's all right. Like Tokyo or soccer is cool as well.

521
00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:46.653
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

522
00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:48.370
<v 1>Well, complimentary comments. Thank you very much.</v>

523
00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.960
Let me look at the super chats again.

524
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:53.410
I'm not good at keeping track of all this stuff. And then VK,

525
00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:57.610
I sit next to him before. Thanks again, VK. And we have Ben sack,

526
00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:00.790
Ben, um, S E a C.

527
00:35:00.791 --> 00:35:04.390
I don't know how to pronounce that said if you ever thought of doing a video on

528
00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:06.760
old English, that'd be pretty interesting. Anyway.

529
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:08.710
Thanks for the great content you put out.

530
00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:12.670
This is one of the few channels I always look forward to watching. Thank you,

531
00:35:12.671 --> 00:35:16.720
Ben. I appreciate that. Yeah. I have thought about doing a video on old English,

532
00:35:16.721 --> 00:35:18.430
to be honest, I've thought about all of them.

533
00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:22.900
I have a lot of topics on my list that I intend to do. Uh,

534
00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:26.380
it's just hard to get to them because each video takes so long to make

535
00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:36.250
And another $20. Wow. You guys are generous and I appreciate the super chats.

536
00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:40.680
Thank you so much. Uh, more sharp, 12. You are amazing. No,

537
00:35:40.681 --> 00:35:44.850
I think you are amazing for shark 12 and that's a cool name.

538
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:46.050
The sharpest boring

539
00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:52.010
Russia. Did you donate twice?

540
00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:55.970
Did you send two $20 super chats or is that,

541
00:35:56.810 --> 00:36:01.640
is that one with two messages? If you sent two of them. Whoa,

542
00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:06.920
thank you. Anyway, I really, really appreciate super chats.

543
00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:11.300
I don't expect to get them, but that's really cool. And MLK. Okay.

544
00:36:11.301 --> 00:36:16.190
55 something. What's is that, um, Norwegian currency? What is an,

545
00:36:16.191 --> 00:36:19.220
okay. I love your channel.

546
00:36:19.221 --> 00:36:22.250
And I've been a subscriber for over five years. I think I'm curious.

547
00:36:22.251 --> 00:36:25.040
How do you choose? Let me see that again. I lost it.

548
00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:29.923
<v 0>Well now I can't see it.</v>

549
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:32.870
<v 1>Let me find it again. Okay.</v>

550
00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:37.670
How do you choose what language to learn and how do you start? Well,

551
00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:42.380
I don't really choose what language to learn. The language chooses me.

552
00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:46.160
It's all based on irrational motivation. Um,

553
00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:51.020
if I was choosing logically, then I would have gone all in on Spanish and uh,

554
00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:53.690
really learned it. Uh, but he learned it well.

555
00:36:53.691 --> 00:36:57.260
So I would be able to make content about Spanish, which would be super popular,

556
00:36:57.650 --> 00:37:00.800
but instead I'm studying Indonesian right now.

557
00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:04.220
I'm trying to get to a C1 level and Indonesian. I'm probably at a,

558
00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:06.080
a B2 level right now,

559
00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:10.010
but I want to get to see one Indonesian is a big language.

560
00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:12.890
A lot of people speak it spoken by, well,

561
00:37:12.891 --> 00:37:16.340
if you include Malai then maybe 270,

562
00:37:16.341 --> 00:37:20.090
280 million people or something like that. Uh, it's a,

563
00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.680
it's a widely spoken language,

564
00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:26.960
but it's not popular as a language to study amongst people around the world. Uh,

565
00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:29.630
but I think it will be in the future, but yeah,

566
00:37:29.631 --> 00:37:32.600
I just choose which language to study based on what grabs me.

567
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:35.090
There's no logic to it.

568
00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:45.560
There's a delay. Okay. Yeah. There's kind of, there's some, some delay.

569
00:37:45.561 --> 00:37:48.740
I think my computer is actually slowing down.

570
00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:53.730
My computer is getting overloaded. So there's a bit of a problem with a

571
00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:56.870
bit of a problem with the sync.

572
00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:06.170
Hello from Greece. What have you studied? Are you a linguist? Well,

573
00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:11.120
I don't think of myself as a professional linguist, uh, because I don't,

574
00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:16.910
I don't professionally spend my time researching, uh,

575
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.870
researching linguistics. Uh, but I,

576
00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.300
I do use linguistics in my job.

577
00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:26.540
I teach English as a foreign language in the university and I've done that for a

578
00:38:26.541 --> 00:38:30.740
long time and that's applied linguistics and it involves a lot of elements of

579
00:38:30.741 --> 00:38:35.470
linguistics. Um, but my dedication to languages in general,

580
00:38:35.471 --> 00:38:38.230
that's basically just my passion. I'm a language enthusiast.

581
00:38:38.231 --> 00:38:41.530
I just love languages and linguistics and I have for a long time.

582
00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.740
So that's not really my profession. It's my passion.

583
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:54.360
Someone said, are there any languages or projects you started,

584
00:38:54.361 --> 00:38:56.730
but couldn't finish. Uh,

585
00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:01.590
I don't know if you mean videos or just languages that I tried to learn and

586
00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:06.150
couldn't really get very far with them. Um, yeah, I mean,

587
00:39:06.151 --> 00:39:08.250
there've been plenty, plenty of those. Plenty of both.

588
00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:12.030
I've had to stop some videos in the middle when I was researching because it was

589
00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:15.300
too difficult and I couldn't make sense of the topic. Uh,

590
00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:18.210
and I've started studying some languages.

591
00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:23.760
Usually I was excited in the beginning to start a language. Um,

592
00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:27.810
in these cases, like when I stopped early on,

593
00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:31.950
I was excited in the beginning to start studying this particular language.

594
00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:35.460
But once I got to the difficult parts,

595
00:39:35.461 --> 00:39:39.750
then I realized I wasn't as motivated as I thought. And, um, I,

596
00:39:39.751 --> 00:39:43.260
it was just more the novelty, the idea of learning that language was cool,

597
00:39:43.261 --> 00:39:47.190
but I wasn't motivated enough to get through the difficulty of it.

598
00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:50.910
So that's where the irrational motivation comes in.

599
00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:54.870
If I choose a language just based on logic, like this one would be useful,

600
00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:57.810
you know, I never go very far with it.

601
00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:04.380
I think it's about time to end the stream. You guys, because it's late here,

602
00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:08.520
it's after midnight and my neighbors can hear me and they are starting to bang

603
00:40:08.521 --> 00:40:12.630
with a broom. So it's time to go to bed, but, um,

604
00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:17.310
I hope everyone stays healthy and keep safe out there wherever you are. Um,

605
00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:20.340
I know, you know, America is having a lot of trouble right now.

606
00:40:20.341 --> 00:40:23.430
I know Italy is still in a bad condition,

607
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:26.820
a lot of Europe and you know, everywhere basically.

608
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:30.720
So I hope everyone stays safe and healthy as much as possible.

609
00:40:30.721 --> 00:40:35.130
And I'm also hope that you are taking care of yourself at home.

610
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.700
Um, trying to stay, stay positive and,

611
00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:43.590
and healthy and happy and productive when you're stuck at home. All right.

612
00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:46.200
So thank you very much, everyone have a good nights.

613
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:50.610
It's time to get some sleep, but I'll see you soon in the next video.

614
00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:54.690
Have a good night and VK. Thanks again. Oh,

615
00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:59.820
VK said stay safe and you donated again crazy, man. Well, thank you so much.

616
00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:02.550
I love you guys. All right. Good night.

617
00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:27.930
