<v 1>Well, how about this idea?</v>

Tell your boss to go to hell in 50 different languages.

12
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.630
<v 0>Hello.</v>

13
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.740
<v 1>Everyone. Welcome to the Lang focus channel and the, my name is Paul.</v>

14
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.750
Like we just decided a moment to go.

15
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.500
Today's topic is the main language of Norway Norwegian,

16
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.430
a language that in many ways feels familiar to speakers of English and other

17
00:00:49.431 --> 00:00:53.300
Germanic languages like Dutch and German. As I said in my video,

18
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.140
want the North Germanic languages of the Nordic nations Norwegian as a North

19
00:00:57.141 --> 00:00:59.720
Germanic language, along with Swedish and Danish,

20
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.560
as well as Icelandic and Pharaoh wheeze by around the second century,

21
00:01:03.561 --> 00:01:05.210
CE prodo Germanic,

22
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.800
the earliest common ancestor of aldermanic languages had begun to branch out

23
00:01:09.801 --> 00:01:13.970
into Western Eastern and Northern dialects. And by the eighth century,

24
00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:18.800
CE the Northern dialect had developed into old Norse spoken by the seafaring

25
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.720
Viking tribes over the next 600 years or so old North developed into the various

26
00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:25.550
North Germanic languages of today.

27
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.900
Norwegian today is spoken by around 5 million people, mainly in Norway.

28
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.500
As I discuss at length in my video on the North Germanic languages,

29
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.490
Norwegian is very similar to neighboring Swedish and Danish. And in writing,

30
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.510
they share a high degree of mutual intelligibility, but in speaking well,

31
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.460
it depends differences in pronunciation and an extensive dialect continuum that

32
00:01:46.461 --> 00:01:49.580
spans all three languages make intelligibility difficult.

33
00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:54.260
In many cases that dialect continuum exists within each of those three countries

34
00:01:54.261 --> 00:01:56.180
as well inside Norway,

35
00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.260
there are dialects that vary greatly from each other in most countries with lots

36
00:02:00.261 --> 00:02:03.920
of dialectal variation. The standard language is a unifying force,

37
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.950
a bridge between the various dialects, but in Norway,

38
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.660
there are two officially recognized standard languages [inaudible] which means

39
00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:14.030
book language and Nina nosh,

40
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.500
which means new Norwegian during the centuries long union between Denmark and

41
00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:22.550
Norway, the Norwegian elite spoke a form of Danish with their own Norwegian

42
00:02:22.551 --> 00:02:25.700
pronunciation. And Danish was the written language of Norway.

43
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.520
After the end of the union in the 19th century,

44
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.860
a movement for a new national language began.

45
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.460
Some people wanted to base the national language on Danish with minor

46
00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:38.120
adjustments, which resulted in a written form called Greek small.

47
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.380
Others wanted the national language to be more distinctly Norwegian than Danish.

48
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.230
This resulted in the creation of London, small,

49
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.090
a more conservative written form,

50
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.050
which was created using elements of various rural Norwegian dialects.

51
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.130
This was the precursor of new notch. The Norwegian linguist,

52
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.040
he bought Orson created long, small.

53
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.390
He examined the multitude of rural Norwegian dialect,

54
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.250
especially those of Western Norway,

55
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.870
looking for the elements that each dialect had preserved from old Norwegian and

56
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.040
use those to create as traditional a form of Norwegian as possible while still

57
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:16.690
being based on its modern dialects. Why did he focus on rural dialect?

58
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.010
Because the urban dialects had been influenced by Danish while rural dialects

59
00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:25.840
were more purely Norwegian, but it's small, still exists in its original form,

60
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.670
but was mostly replaced with a slightly updated version called [inaudible] lung.

61
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.080
Small was also replaced with a slightly updated form called new NAUSC

62
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.210
book Mol and Nia nosh are more similar than small and land small,

63
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.380
where there were plans to merge them into a single standard called some

64
00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:48.880
nauseous, but that never happened. So now there are two standards today.

65
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.110
Local governments can choose one of the two standards as their official form and

66
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:58.000
26% representing around 12% of the population have chosen Nina.

67
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:02.830
NAUSC mostly rural communities in Western Norway around 37% have

68
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:07.660
made book mall official and 37% are neutral, but in those areas,

69
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.400
book mall tends to dominate,

70
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.630
but everyone is also required to study the other standard as a secondary form.

71
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.590
These standard languages are mainly written and when it comes to speaking

72
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.370
Norwegians usually use their own dialect, even in formal situations.

73
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.680
First let's focus on boop mall and later we'll look at me nosh in comparison,

74
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.990
pronunciation and orthography,

75
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.870
there are a tremendous number of different accents in Norway.

76
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.390
And even when pronouncing standard book mall,

77
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.670
they will likely pronounce it in their own accent.

78
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.270
All ways of pronouncing Norwegian are officially considered correct,

79
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.880
but let's focus on the pronunciation of Oslo,

80
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.170
which sort of serves as an unofficial pronunciation standard continence.

81
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.190
The pronunciation of Norwegian consonant letters is often different from their

82
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:54.670
English equivalent G is usually pronounced good.

83
00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.340
<v 0>Gun, but before EDI.</v>

84
00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.010
<v 1>I I, or why it's pronounced. Yeah.</v>

85
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.440
<v 0>Yay. And the letter J.</v>

86
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.300
<v 1>Is also pronounced that way. Not like.</v>

87
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.243
<v 0>J</v>

88
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.320
R is usually an alveolar trill at odd. This is.

89
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.780
<v 1>One sound that varies greatly throughout the country.</v>

90
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.230
It can also be an alveolar tap and another accent.

91
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.750
It's a uvular fricative like, hah,

92
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.570
the letter K is pronounced before N where it would be silent in English Neve.

93
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.870
So unlike the English word knife, this actually makes sense.

94
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.840
K is also associated with some other sounds.

95
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.160
The combination KJ is pronounced char like in the English word.

96
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.140
<v 0>Hugh Shula.</v>

97
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.020
<v 1>So as K before E I, I, or Y.</v>

98
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.910
<v 0>She knew, but these.</v>

99
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.680
<v 1>Days it seems that among young people,</v>

100
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.350
there's a growing tendency to pronounce these as HSA.

101
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.620
And I understand that this is the source of much controversy.

102
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.380
The letter S also appears in some combinations to represent the sound HSA or

103
00:05:55.381 --> 00:05:58.400
approximations thereof, SJ. Sure.

104
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.200
<v 0>S KJ, shoo and S K before E I I,</v>

105
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.640
or Y she,

106
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.720
some consonant letters are silent in certain contexts.

107
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.330
There's the letter G for example, in words,

108
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:15.800
ending in IgG or EG dial-in and before J

109
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:16.940
yes.

110
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.040
And in some other words like mourn D is sometimes silent.

111
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.821
For example,

112
00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:27.470
after R L or N or after a long vowel,

113
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.060
goo H is silent before J and V.

114
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.720
The letter T is silent in the definite form of neuter nouns,

115
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.410
like whose and in the neuter pronoun there.

116
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.170
And V is usually silent after L at the end of a word hall

117
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.710
along consonants, double consonant letters,

118
00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:54.950
and clusters of consonants are pronounced as long continent.

119
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.730
They are held longer than a short continent, for example, huh.

120
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.690
Now compare that to this word with a short continent hall.

121
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.990
This distinction occurs only in stressed syllables.

122
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.890
There's also a distinction between short and long vowels.

123
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.430
When a syllable contains a long consonant, it has a short vowel.

124
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.920
And when a syllable contains a short consonant, it has a long vowel hall.

125
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.470
They differ in length, but sometimes also in quality too, for example, Oh,

126
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.140
short, Oh, stop and long. Oh, book.

127
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:34.420
I first short cyst and long C

128
00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:39.430
this vowel is long because it's in an open syllable with no consonant at the end

129
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.800
E short E 10. And Longie PIM,

130
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.850
there are some other vowels that are different from English vowels.

131
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:53.920
The Norwegian Y sound is like the sound E but with rounded lips,

132
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.530
he lease,

133
00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:01.720
you represents a sound between OU and E who's.

134
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:05.740
This letter is like the sound air, but with rounded lips,

135
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.420
it's also worth pointing out two more vowels.

136
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.440
This letter used to be common in old English, but as rare in modern English,

137
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:18.010
it's been a part of Norwegian ever since it developed from old Norse,

138
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.220
it represents the sound app as an English set,

139
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:26.080
but usually comes after our shod. It's sometimes pronounced like a,

140
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:27.063
this,

141
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:32.620
this letter represents the sound all similar to the vowel in the English word,

142
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:37.060
yawn, the way it's pronounced in many British accents store.

143
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.800
Most words in Norwegian have pitch accent. There's a pitch accent,

144
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.140
or a tone change on the stressed syllable.

145
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.040
There are two different tone patterns. Tone. One is low high.

146
00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.630
It starts on a low tone,

147
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.890
then moves to a higher tone in the stressed syllable tone. Two is high,

148
00:08:53.891 --> 00:08:56.010
low high. It starts high, but.

149
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.010
<v 1>Falls then moves to a higher tone in the stressed syllable.</v>

150
00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.060
<v 2>The mud Berlin.</v>

151
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.460
<v 1>You can see from the two examples pitch.</v>

152
00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:06.710
Accent can indicate differences in meaning,

153
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.220
but the tones are different depending on the dialect and are not crucial in

154
00:09:10.221 --> 00:09:11.600
making yourself understood.

155
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.910
But ignoring pitch accent will result in a distinctly foreign accent grammar.

156
00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.270
The grammar of Norwegian is not terribly complex,

157
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:24.260
and it's a category one language according to the American foreign service

158
00:09:24.261 --> 00:09:24.950
Institute,

159
00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:28.910
which puts it in the category of languages that are supposedly the easiest for

160
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.270
English speakers to learn. That doesn't mean that it's easy to learn.

161
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.390
It just means that it's not as difficult as a lot of other languages.

162
00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:39.680
And that specifically for English speakers, let's look at a basic sentence.

163
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:45.050
This sentence means I haven't eaten anything today. Word for word EDS.

164
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.990
I have not eaten anything today.

165
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.040
The word order in this sentence is exactly the same as an English Norwegians.

166
00:09:52.041 --> 00:09:54.200
Basic word order is S V O.

167
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.650
And we can see that the verb is conjugated in the present. Perfect.

168
00:09:57.651 --> 00:10:01.610
In the same way, it is in English with the auxiliary verb hall,

169
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:05.600
which means have in the present tense followed by the past participle of the

170
00:10:05.601 --> 00:10:06.434
verb.

171
00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:07.843
<v 2>Speece.</v>

172
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.190
<v 1>And also notice that just like in English,</v>

173
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:14.390
the negation word comes between the auxiliary verb and the past participle,

174
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:18.980
but Norwegian verb conjugations are even simpler than they are in English.

175
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:22.310
There are conjugated the same, regardless of person or number.

176
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.590
So for each tense, there is only one form.

177
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:26.900
<v 2>Speece is a regular.</v>

178
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:27.200
<v 1>Verb.</v>

179
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.640
So it's a good example in the present tense [inaudible] you can see that even

180
00:10:31.641 --> 00:10:34.130
though the pronouns are different, the verb forms are all there.

181
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:39.290
<v 2>Sam SPI Sid also in the simple past, there's only one form USB sta.</v>

182
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.980
<v 1>And there's one future tense form visa.</v>

183
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.060
There are additional perfect and conditional conjugations that correspond with

184
00:10:47.061 --> 00:10:49.640
those in English. Each of them having only one form,

185
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.650
one minor pain in the backside is that Norwegian nouns have grammatical gender

186
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:57.350
feminine, masculine, and neuter. For example.

187
00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.790
<v 2>I give in the meaning a woman in mom, meaning a man it's field,</v>

188
00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.713
meaning a mountain.

189
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.170
<v 1>For announced that are not inherently masculine or feminine,</v>

190
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:09.860
like man or a woman, the gender of each now needs to be memorized,

191
00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:13.670
but notice the gender specific indefinite article that comes before each.

192
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:16.850
Now there are also gender specific, definite articles,

193
00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.130
definite articles attached to the end of that.

194
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.880
<v 2>To be not that a woman Mon the man, she.</v>

195
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.320
<v 1>These three genders are used in more conservative Norwegian.</v>

196
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.670
And in ne now using three genders is required, but in book mall,

197
00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:35.780
you can choose to treat masculine and feminine announced as one gender common

198
00:11:35.781 --> 00:11:37.430
gender in the common gender,

199
00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.340
both feminine and masculine nouns use the masculine form.

200
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.750
Remember that people who use boot mall as their written language may still speak

201
00:11:44.751 --> 00:11:48.020
dialects that are different and may use all three genders in speech.

202
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.770
Even if they use two in writing, let's stick with the common gender for now.

203
00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.310
Now let's check out the forms of the notes.

204
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:55.440
<v 0>Kevin, the nerds.</v>

205
00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.730
<v 2>Meaning women, men, meaning men.</v>

206
00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:02.490
<v 0>Meaning mountains is the same as the singular form.</v>

207
00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:05.490
Neuter announced like this that are only one syllable long.

208
00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.940
Usually don't change in the plural, but you can tell that it's the plural.

209
00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:12.000
If there's no article second, look at men.

210
00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.940
This is an irregular plural form with a change in the vowel STEM Kevin.

211
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.490
This is a regular plural form. Plurals of all genders usually end in ER,

212
00:12:20.491 --> 00:12:22.920
like this as for the definite plural forms.

213
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:26.760
The ending is which functions as the definite article.

214
00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:30.000
<v 2>Been in LA, the women, men are men.</v>

215
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.230
<v 0>The mountains let's make those nouns.</v>

216
00:12:34.231 --> 00:12:36.330
We just saw a little more interesting by adding.

217
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:41.580
<v 2>And it literally a beautiful woman, insect mum, a handsome man,</v>

218
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:42.720
[inaudible].

219
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.670
<v 0>A tall mountain or a high mountain.</v>

220
00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:48.000
The adjective to a certain extent agrees with gender.

221
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.590
A T is added to the end of most staff directives when the noun is neuter like

222
00:12:52.591 --> 00:12:56.880
this T at the end of and when announced plural.

223
00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:00.870
And he has added to the end of the adjective in both the neuter and common

224
00:13:00.871 --> 00:13:01.704
genders.

225
00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:05.850
<v 2>Need liquidated, beautiful women sector, men handsome men, who are you feeling?</v>

226
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.890
<v 0>Tall mountains or high mountains.</v>

227
00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.330
Also when a noun phrase with an adjective is definite,

228
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:15.870
there's an E at the end of the adjective, but something else also changes.

229
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:20.160
There's a different definite article. Then the beautiful woman,

230
00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:22.470
then [inaudible] the handsome man,

231
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:26.820
the tall mountain or the high mountain. And in the.

232
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.790
<v 2>Plural Dean is lecture when the beautiful women,</v>

233
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:33.600
[inaudible] the handsome men. [inaudible].

234
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.710
<v 0>The tall mountains with the high mountains, both genders, Coleman,</v>

235
00:13:37.711 --> 00:13:41.250
and neuter take the same article and the same endings on the adjective.

236
00:13:41.251 --> 00:13:42.084
And the noun.

237
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:47.010
Adjectives are also used to create adverbs by simply using the indefinite

238
00:13:47.011 --> 00:13:50.010
singular neuter form of the adjective. Like, Hey,

239
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:54.300
they usually have a tea ending though. There are some exceptions, Hey,

240
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.900
as an adverb means loudly as in, at a high volume.

241
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.830
Now that we've examined some basic features of Norwegian,

242
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.510
specifically boot mold,

243
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:08.190
let's look at mold and new notch side-by-side and see how they're different.

244
00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.430
Let's start with a sentence we saw earlier in book mold,

245
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.290
meaning I haven't eaten anything today.

246
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:17.040
<v 2>Yeah, hard. It gets BS, Loyola, the color shift and awkward duck.</v>

247
00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.370
<v 0>These sentences don't seem so different, but there are a few differences.</v>

248
00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:24.060
The first person singular subject pronoun has a slightly different form,

249
00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.540
ye egg. Similarly,

250
00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.180
some of the other subject pronouns have different forms.

251
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:35.760
Next notice that the negation word is spelled differently. Isha.

252
00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:42.000
Now notice that the verb for eat is different in ni [inaudible] is also

253
00:14:42.001 --> 00:14:46.260
used, but this option, it is more specific to new NAUSC.

254
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:50.610
And also notice that the word for something or anything is different. Newer,

255
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.153
new Google.

256
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.510
<v 1>Obviously the words in book mold and new nosh are often related,</v>

257
00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.450
but with slightly different forms in spoken dialects,

258
00:14:59.451 --> 00:15:03.320
there are additional variations. Some of which resembled Nia notch more,

259
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.860
and some of which resemble Luke, [inaudible] more, here's a sentence.

260
00:15:06.861 --> 00:15:08.360
Meaning she had a bad dream.

261
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.650
<v 2>Who not. Then one drum who had the [inaudible].</v>

262
00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.430
<v 1>Notice that the third person singular feminine pronoun is different.</v>

263
00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:18.760
Also the masculine indefinite article is slightly different.

264
00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.510
You can also see that the word for dream looks and sounds a little different

265
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.433
than them.

266
00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:28.720
Nia NAUSC tends to preserve more old diphthongs from old North.

267
00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.680
Then boot mall in this way, ne [inaudible] is more like Pharaoh, wheeze,

268
00:15:32.681 --> 00:15:36.880
and Icelandic. Then book malt or Danish or Swedish. Here's a sentence.

269
00:15:36.881 --> 00:15:39.040
Meaning they like to drive fast cars.

270
00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:43.683
<v 2>[Inaudible] [inaudible].</v>

271
00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.970
<v 1>First. The subject pronoun is slightly different.</v>

272
00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:50.850
Next notice that the infinitive forms of the verbs are slightly different should

273
00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.100
show her in bookmark.

274
00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:57.370
The infinitive of most verbs ends in an unstressed eat in neo-Nazis.

275
00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:02.260
The vowel can actually be either E or a with a being the more conservative one.

276
00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:05.860
Now notice that the word for cars ends in ER,

277
00:16:05.861 --> 00:16:07.960
in book mall and AR in

278
00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.940
[inaudible] [inaudible] has a tendency to use AR when boop mall uses, ER,

279
00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:19.330
though this is not always the case. Here's another sentence.

280
00:16:19.331 --> 00:16:22.270
Meaning crime is increasing due to high unemployment.

281
00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:27.850
<v 2>[Inaudible] criminality. [inaudible].</v>

282
00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:30.790
<v 1>Notice the different spelling of the verb,</v>

283
00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:35.650
meaning increase including the ER and AR endings that we just mentioned as well

284
00:16:35.651 --> 00:16:39.040
as a diphthong appearing in the new nosh word. Good.

285
00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.550
Go next. Notice the difference in the way of saying do too, we'll get,

286
00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:47.950
do not good enough. This way is more characteristically [inaudible],

287
00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.820
but a new notch. You can also use the same expression as in book mall.

288
00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:55.603
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

289
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:59.200
<v 1>In book mall. There is also another form. You do this,</v>

290
00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:03.100
but it's less commonly used. Notice the differences in the words,

291
00:17:03.101 --> 00:17:04.270
meaning unemployment.

292
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.450
<v 2>Lisette, Elbit slicer.</v>

293
00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.840
<v 1>The word in malt contains the suffix head,</v>

294
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:13.540
which is used to turn adjectives into nouns.

295
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:18.010
But new nosh generally avoids this suffix because it reflects the influence of

296
00:17:18.011 --> 00:17:20.890
Danish. Ni naush has a degree of linguistic.

297
00:17:20.891 --> 00:17:24.190
Purism aiming to avoid lone words from Danish and German.

298
00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:27.070
And one final pair of sentences.

299
00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:29.860
Meaning falling in love is common among young people.

300
00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:34.600
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

301
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:39.100
<v 1>Notice that the first word in either sentence has a different ending ne tends to</v>

302
00:17:39.101 --> 00:17:43.840
avoid the book mall ending Elsa, which forms a noun from a verb. Next,

303
00:17:43.841 --> 00:17:46.990
we see a different spelling of the word, meaning common. And again,

304
00:17:46.991 --> 00:17:51.000
we see the ER ending in book mall where it's AR in new NAUSC,

305
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.780
as you can see, Norwegian is a very interesting language.

306
00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:58.290
And if you speak a different dramatic language than it probably seems very

307
00:17:58.291 --> 00:18:02.250
familiar to you in many ways, it's also a very accessible language,

308
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:05.910
especially if you focus on boop mall like most students do,

309
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.580
but when you dig a little deeper, there are many,

310
00:18:08.581 --> 00:18:12.840
many dialects with countless variations for you to get used to as well as new

311
00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.360
NAUSC the other form of standard Norwegian.

312
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.910
So even though it's an accessible language,

313
00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:21.780
it's also a language with a lot of depth for people who choose to go deep.

314
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:25.920
The question of the day for native speakers of Norwegian in any of its

315
00:18:25.921 --> 00:18:29.670
varieties, which form of Norwegian do you most commonly use in writing.

316
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.260
And how about in speech?

317
00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:35.910
Can you easily communicate with people who use other varieties and for other

318
00:18:35.911 --> 00:18:36.480
people,

319
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.290
what do you think of the situation of having two standard versions of the same

320
00:18:40.291 --> 00:18:41.580
language in one country?

321
00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.700
Can you imagine such a situation with your own language?

322
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:46.590
If you enjoyed this video,

323
00:18:46.591 --> 00:18:50.160
then be sure to check out Lang focus on the various social media platforms.

324
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:53.670
And as always, I want to give a special thanks to my Patrion supporters,

325
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:55.890
especially these ones right here on the screen,

326
00:18:55.891 --> 00:18:59.190
who are my top tier Patrion supporters. So many extra special,

327
00:18:59.191 --> 00:19:03.290
