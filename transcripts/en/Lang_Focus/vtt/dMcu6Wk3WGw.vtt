00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.460
<v 0>Yeah, what's up. Oh,</v>

2
00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:10.230
that's easy Iranian. Oh,

3
00:00:10.231 --> 00:00:14.570
right. Uh, Israeli. Oh,

4
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.640
Oh right. Okay. I got it now. Sardinia.

5
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.760
<v 1>Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Lang focus channel.</v>

6
00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:32.810
And my name is Paul today's topic is the Italian language.

7
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.750
Italian may not get as much attention as French,

8
00:00:35.751 --> 00:00:40.100
Spanish and Portuguese because it's mainly spoken in Europe rather than informer

9
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.910
colonies,

10
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.930
but it's still one of the most widely spoken languages in the European union

11
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.970
with around 68 million speakers there around 60 million of those speakers are in

12
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.820
Italy. Of course, where Italian is the official language.

13
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.110
Italian is also the official language of some Medina, a tiny enclave,

14
00:00:57.111 --> 00:00:58.280
surrounded by Italy.

15
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.730
And it's also a defecto official language of the Vatican city.

16
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.020
It's also one of the four official languages of Switzerland where it's mainly

17
00:01:06.021 --> 00:01:09.410
used in Ticino and the Southern Canton of called London.

18
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.950
And it's official at the regional level in Slovenian Eastern area.

19
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.440
And in Eastery accounty in Croatia,

20
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.300
it's also spoken by overseas communities among them in the United States where

21
00:01:20.301 --> 00:01:22.400
over 700,000 people speak it.

22
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.230
According to the us census Bureau and Italian has had a cultural impact on the

23
00:01:27.231 --> 00:01:31.400
rest of the world because Italian composers developed our current system of

24
00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:32.480
musical notation.

25
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.160
Italian is the common language of musical notation at nomenclature words like

26
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.360
acapella, crescendo, soprano, and tempo all come from Italian.

27
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.070
And if you're a coffee lover,

28
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.420
you probably know some Italian words because Italian coffee culture has inspired

29
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.320
imitation throughout the world. Words like espresso from

30
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.890
express. So meaning pressed out coffee Grundy, which means large venti,

31
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.780
which means 20 as in more than 20 ounces of coffee and Trenta,

32
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.040
which means heart attack. Actually it means 30, but yeah,

33
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.480
Italian is a member of the Italo Dalmatian branch of the romance language

34
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.330
family. But when we talk about the Italian language,

35
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.040
what exactly are we talking about?

36
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.820
As I spoke about at length in my video on the languages of Italy,

37
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.770
Italy has historically had an extremely diverse variety of romance dialects,

38
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.270
which can be grouped together and arguably classified as dialects of various

39
00:02:29.271 --> 00:02:30.320
regional languages.

40
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.490
The majority of these dialects belong to the Italo Dalmatian branch,

41
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.500
but many in Northern Italy do not.

42
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.370
When we speak about the Italian language in its strictest sense,

43
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.380
we are speaking about standard Italian,

44
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.060
which developed from a specific set of Italo Dalmatian, dialects, those scandal,

45
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.590
the Tuscan dialects that are spoken in the Tuscany region. And in particular,

46
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.550
the Florentine dialect of Florence, the romance dialects in Italy,

47
00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.280
like all romance languages developed from varieties of vulgar, Latin, Latin,

48
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.180
originally the language of Rome and the Roman empire remained the formal

49
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:08.080
language of writing and literature up until the late middle ages and what is now

50
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.700
Italy. But during that period of vernacular, literary tradition began to emerge.

51
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.570
In other words,

52
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.710
literature written in the language of everyday speech rather than Latin became

53
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:18.640
more widespread.

54
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.500
The seeds of standard Italian were planted by Tuscan poetry and literature in

55
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:27.370
the 13th century, in the 14th century, Tuscan poet,

56
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.040
[inaudible] published his masterpiece,

57
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.120
the divine comedy in Italian originally called just Commedia,

58
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.910
but later referred to as Devina Commedia,

59
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.920
Dante was from Florence and his writing largely resembled the Tuscan dialect of

60
00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:45.580
that city with some elements of Latin, as well as other dialects,

61
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.020
Dante is often referred to as the father of the Italian language because his

62
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:54.220
work came to be read by educated people in every region of the peninsula.

63
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.293
As a result,

64
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.320
the form of language used in his writing became the most widely understood.

65
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.240
And over the next couple of centuries,

66
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.900
it became established as the de facto standard literary language.

67
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.490
Other 14th century poets who greatly contributed to this were Francesco

68
00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:13.600
Petrarca and Giovanni Boccaccio in the 16th century,

69
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.010
Pietro bamboo helped to standardize literary Italian based on the model of

70
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.020
[inaudible] Boccaccio and Allie, Gary later in the 19th century,

71
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.790
a novelist named Alessandra Manzoni had a big impact on the development of

72
00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:31.120
modern standard Italian, thanks to his novel, the petroleum,

73
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.330
which is called [inaudible] in Italian.

74
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.710
This was the first novel written in Italian and is said to be the most famous

75
00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:40.210
novel in the Italian language.

76
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.760
Even though it's not widely read in other languages,

77
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.350
Manzoni wrote the novel in the modern Florentine dialect with some influence

78
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:50.050
from the Florentine literature of the 14th century.

79
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.400
When the historical States of Italy became unified in the 19th century,

80
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.480
Italian became the official language of Italy and the Italian government

81
00:04:58.481 --> 00:05:03.310
accepted [inaudible] proposal to make this variety standard Italian at the

82
00:05:03.311 --> 00:05:07.050
time of unification, most Italians were not able to speak Italian,

83
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.600
meaning literary Tuscan different. Yeah.

84
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.610
Estimates from that time range from 2.5% of the population to 10% of the

85
00:05:14.611 --> 00:05:18.840
population, even though it was the most widely understood written language,

86
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.050
most of the population were illiterate and lacked exposure to it.

87
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.160
Unifying the linguistically diverse nation became one of Italians main

88
00:05:26.161 --> 00:05:30.180
functions. Nowadays, virtually all Italians are fluent in Italian,

89
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.650
which exists alongside its Elise vast array of romance dialects though,

90
00:05:34.651 --> 00:05:37.890
in some areas, Italian has largely replaced local dialects.

91
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.600
What's the Italian like first let's look at a few basic words and phrases.

92
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.640
Hello, ciao.

93
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.630
Notice letter C here represents the soft Chuck sound.

94
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.430
That's how it's pronounced before I or eat before a O or you,

95
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.060
it represents a heart cut sound as in Quantico,

96
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.650
sta which means how much does it cost? Good morning.

97
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.900
Bongiorno notice here that the letter G represents a soft G sound again,

98
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.820
that's the pronunciation before I,

99
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:12.770
or eat before a O U or a consonant it's pronounced to go like

100
00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:15.380
in the word for thank you, guests. Yeah.

101
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.090
Aside from the hard G notice the pronunciation of the letter Z in Italian,

102
00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:24.590
it represents a sound or Z at the beginning of words,

103
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.800
though, there are exceptions goodbye.

104
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.140
<v 2>Video or chow.</v>

105
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.060
<v 1>Note, the pronunciation of the Italian R sound. It's a rolled R sound.</v>

106
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.751
In other words,

107
00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:40.730
a trill it's a longer trill sound when doubled and it's a tap when it appears

108
00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:44.240
between vowels. You'll notice it in the next couple of words as well.

109
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:49.000
<v 2>Please. Beautiful order. I'd like vote today. I'd like the fish, please.</v>

110
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:51.183
[inaudible] there for voting.

111
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.370
<v 1>Notice the pronunciation of se in base.</v>

112
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.650
It's pronounced like before I N E but before other bowels or before

113
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.030
continents, it's pronounced Schutte like in the phrase, meaning, excuse me,

114
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.640
miss cruisy. On top of the sound,

115
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.050
notice that S is pronounced Z between vowels it's voiced

116
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.633
where's the station.

117
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.440
<v 2>[Inaudible] recalled that.</v>

118
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.820
<v 1>The letter Z sounds like not Z. I love Italy.</v>

119
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.000
<v 2>Um, well Italia, I understand tepee SCO.</v>

120
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.580
I don't understand non-coffee score.

121
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.900
<v 1>Now let's jump into some more sentences and see what we can learn about the</v>

122
00:07:28.901 --> 00:07:29.734
language.

123
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.333
<v 2>[Inaudible] English. Is it.</v>

124
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.980
<v 1>This means Mark speaks English and Italian word for word it.</v>

125
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.450
Marco speaks Italian and English in simple sentences like this,

126
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.870
the word order is the same as an English. Another thing you might notice,

127
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:47.890
and you may have noticed in the previous set of basic words and phrases is the

128
00:07:47.891 --> 00:07:50.980
strong tendency for Italian words to end in a vowel.

129
00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:54.610
That's true for almost all words in Italian. They end in vowels.

130
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.820
We saw two exceptions in the previous set of basic words,

131
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:02.620
eel meaning and known meaning no, or not.

132
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:07.060
Both of them short function words. There are five vowel letters in Italian.

133
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.980
Ah, eh, a E Aw, Oh,

134
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:17.140
Ooh. Two of them, E N O have two sounds open and closed.

135
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.550
It's worth noting that different regional accents don't always distinguish

136
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.850
between the open and closed vowel sounds. So if you can't,

137
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.780
it's not the end of the world. I guess there are also diphthongs though.

138
00:08:28.781 --> 00:08:31.630
They are usually just a simple combination of two vowels.

139
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:36.070
Another thing to notice is that each of the words with more than one syllable is

140
00:08:36.071 --> 00:08:39.730
stressed on the penultimate syllable. In other words, the second to last.

141
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:43.640
<v 2>Mariko Barla Italiano English.</v>

142
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.560
<v 1>This isn't true for all words in Italian, but it's generally the case.</v>

143
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.570
The verb bottler is the third person singular conjugation of the verb

144
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.180
in the present tense. Italian has three classes of verbs,

145
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:01.050
audit verbs at verbs and EDA verbs.

146
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.830
Notice that the three classes are conjugated slightly differently with some

147
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:08.880
slightly different verb. Endings, Otto verbs are almost all regular,

148
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.100
but among Edda and EDA verbs.

149
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.760
There's a significant number of irregular verbs that veer from the regular

150
00:09:14.761 --> 00:09:17.610
patterns. Let's look at another sentence.

151
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.640
<v 2>[Inaudible] of brands or G lasagna.</v>

152
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.560
<v 1>It means I ate my favorite food for lunch today. Lasagna word for word it's.</v>

153
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:31.100
I have eaten my food.

154
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.800
Favorite for lunch today, lasagna,

155
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:37.370
I guess I didn't really need to translate lasagna in the sentence.

156
00:09:37.371 --> 00:09:40.850
The syntax is a little different from English. Unlike the previous sentence,

157
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:41.750
first of all,

158
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:45.680
the subject pronoun can be dropped because the person a number are clear from

159
00:09:45.681 --> 00:09:48.620
the conjugation of the verb. Oh,

160
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:52.580
is the first person singular present tense form of the verb of the,

161
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:57.320
which means to have here it's functioning as the auxiliary verb for [inaudible].

162
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:58.490
This is the tense.

163
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.410
<v 2>[Inaudible] equivalent.</v>

164
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.270
<v 1>To the present, perfect tense in English,</v>

165
00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.230
but in Italian it's also generally used where we would use the simple past in

166
00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:10.700
English. This is one of 14 tenses in Italian, though. There are 21.

167
00:10:10.701 --> 00:10:14.870
If we include the imperative present and past infinitives present and past

168
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.540
participles and present and past Jurrens,

169
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:22.160
some of those tenses are simple tenses and others are compound tenses formed

170
00:10:22.161 --> 00:10:23.330
from an auxiliary verb.

171
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.070
Plus the past participle of the main verb or the [inaudible] for

172
00:10:28.071 --> 00:10:28.850
most verbs,

173
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:33.020
compound tenses are formed with the auxiliary verb of the though there is a

174
00:10:33.021 --> 00:10:36.920
subset of verbs that take S it meaning to be instead.

175
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:41.090
These are usually intransitive verbs that describe movement or a state or

176
00:10:41.091 --> 00:10:44.410
condition. Let's look at the phrase, eat a meal.

177
00:10:44.411 --> 00:10:49.130
Chibo meal is a possessive adjective like my in

178
00:10:49.131 --> 00:10:52.400
English, the possessive adjectives, as well as other adjectives,

179
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.860
like put a Frito agree with the gender.

180
00:10:54.861 --> 00:10:58.670
And number of the known nouns ending in Oh, are usually masculine,

181
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.660
like Chibo and nouns ending an a are usually feminine,

182
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.760
like total meaning cake,

183
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:09.080
some nouns end in E and these can be either masculine or feminine.

184
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:13.850
For instance, Bonnie meaning bread is masculine while cat admit,

185
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.270
meaning meat is feminine in Italian,

186
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.600
possessive adjectives are proceeded by a definite article like.

187
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.680
<v 2>You know, me or Chiba lamina at, or that he may be Scott,</v>

188
00:11:24.681 --> 00:11:26.600
the linear recheck it.

189
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.530
<v 1>Notice that there are different definite articles that agree with gender and</v>

190
00:11:30.531 --> 00:11:34.550
number masculine and feminine, singular, and masculine and feminine plural.

191
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:39.140
There are actually a couple more that appear in certain phonetic contexts, law,

192
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:39.891
masculine,

193
00:11:39.891 --> 00:11:44.690
singular before S plus another continent or before Z look L

194
00:11:44.691 --> 00:11:49.430
apostrophe, both masculine and feminine singular before vowels and

195
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.160
masculine plural before vowels,

196
00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:56.830
before S another continent or the continent Z or before GN.

197
00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:58.593
So there's.

198
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:03.630
<v 0>You Chiba [inaudible] land and us lat Orta Eby. Scott,</v>

199
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:08.610
the lady check that [inaudible] notice that the adjective,

200
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.473
but if he thought.

201
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:11.730
<v 1>After the gnome, whereas an English,</v>

202
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.000
it comes before it in Italian functional adjectives,

203
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:18.000
like possessive adjectives and numbers come before the noun.

204
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:21.060
Descriptive adjectives normally come after the now,

205
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:22.740
but they sometimes come before it.

206
00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.150
The general rule is that adjectives that are strictly factual come after the,

207
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:30.990
now these are called denotative adjectives. For example,

208
00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.920
[inaudible] the fresh cake fresh is denotative.

209
00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:38.820
It's factual adjectives that are quantitative. In other words,

210
00:12:38.821 --> 00:12:42.450
they imply something about the noun come before. For example,

211
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:48.120
[inaudible] the delicious cake. Some adjectives can come before or after,

212
00:12:48.121 --> 00:12:50.460
but with a difference in meaning, for example,

213
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:55.560
Rommel Paul veto means the poor man he's factually poor while.

214
00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.690
<v 0>Bothered a warmer means the.</v>

215
00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:02.490
<v 1>Miserable man. A couple of notes about pronunciation and orthography.</v>

216
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:03.300
Oh,

217
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:08.280
note that the letter H is silent in Italian in the phrase [inaudible] can we

218
00:13:08.281 --> 00:13:11.730
see two different consonant sounds that are written with the G plus another

219
00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:15.060
consonant letter GL represents the sound. Yeah,

220
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.030
this is one of the trickier sounds for learners of Italian.

221
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.420
It's kind of like the double L sound in the word million,

222
00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:25.620
but not quite GN represents the sound. Yeah.

223
00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.560
A palatal nasal, something like Nia,

224
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:32.670
but not quite also note the CHN, no key.

225
00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.380
And also in zoo kiddo,

226
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:39.330
C H is always pronounced as a hard sound in Italian. Similarly,

227
00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:42.480
G H is always pronounced as a hard gut sound.

228
00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:47.370
<v 0>Buggy D form another sentence lays stainless</v>

229
00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:49.110
[inaudible].

230
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:54.060
<v 1>This means you're wearing a nice shirt word for word it's you stay wearing a</v>

231
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:58.470
nice shirt. This sentence could also mean she is wearing a nice shirt.

232
00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:01.230
This is a polite sentence. And in polite speech,

233
00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:05.010
third person pronouns and conjugations are used for the second person.

234
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:08.640
Lei is the third person feminine, singular subject pronoun,

235
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:12.720
and lay with a capital L is the polite second person singular,

236
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.120
but lay would be capitalized here anyway,

237
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.420
since it's at the beginning of the sentence. So out of context,

238
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:22.200
the sentence is ambiguous, but not in context stain,

239
00:14:22.201 --> 00:14:25.290
the sand is a present continuous construction.

240
00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:30.540
It uses the verb study as the auxiliary verb and the Geron of the main verb

241
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:35.580
here or the verb is [inaudible] because this is a polite sentence study

242
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:36.870
is in it's third person,

243
00:14:36.871 --> 00:14:40.620
singular conjugation stop rather than second person singular

244
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.800
notice. Also the indefinite article here,

245
00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.310
indefinite articles agree with the gender of the noun. Oh,

246
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:52.280
is the feminine indefinite article. And it agrees with the feminine Marietta.

247
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.600
There'll be four vowels.

248
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:57.950
The feminine article is with an apostrophe [inaudible].

249
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.850
The masculine definite article is as in

250
00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:08.060
[inaudible] UNO before Z or S with another continent UNO studio.

251
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.530
There are no plural indefinite articles, but part of the, of articles,

252
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.190
meaning some or any are used instead partners of articles,

253
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.400
combined deep meaning of with a definite article.

254
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.680
As we saw before this adjective here also agrees with the noun in gender,

255
00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.220
as well as in number is the feminine singular form.

256
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:32.660
It comes before the noun because it's connotative, it's not factual,

257
00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:35.270
but implies something subjective about the shirt.

258
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:40.520
Italian is a beautiful language and one that captures the imagination of people

259
00:15:40.521 --> 00:15:44.000
all over the world because of the huge Italian cultural influence,

260
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:48.410
both historical and contemporary, I guess that's why Italian is the fourth.

261
00:15:48.411 --> 00:15:52.250
Most widely studied language in the world. Some sources say fifth,

262
00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.660
but let's go with fourth.

263
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:56.870
The question of the day for native speakers of Italian,

264
00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:59.930
what other features of Italian do you want others to know about?

265
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.580
And for learners of Italian,

266
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.550
what have you found the most fun or interesting about the language?

267
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.380
