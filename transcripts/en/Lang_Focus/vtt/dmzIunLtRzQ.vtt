00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.030
<v 0>Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Lang focus channel.</v>

2
00:00:03.031 --> 00:00:07.590
And my name is Paul people who are interested in the history of English.

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.760
Know that English is a Germanic language that developed from old English.

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.200
The language of the Anglo-Saxons who began invading and settling in Britain in

5
00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:17.034
the fifth century.

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.050
It's also widely known that the development of English was heavily impacted by

7
00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:24.780
two periods of contact with other groups of people,

8
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.640
the influence of old North during the period of Scandinavian settlement and the

9
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:32.430
influence of French after the Norman conquest.

10
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.610
But there was also another period of intense contact.

11
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.020
When the Anglo-Saxons began invading Britain in the year four 49,

12
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.250
they encountered the Celts who spoke Celtic languages. And unlike today,

13
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.350
lived throughout the Island of great Britain.

14
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.820
Didn't this major contact also have an impact on English. Well,

15
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:54.300
it's typically thought that it didn't. That's why so few people talk about it.

16
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.920
The traditionally held view is that the Anglo-Saxons massacred the Celts,

17
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.640
leaving them in only a couple of pockets on the Western side of the Island.

18
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.860
That would be Wales and Cornwall, but genetic research, archeological evidence,

19
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.420
and some historical records indicate that the Anglo-Saxons ruled over the Celts,

20
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.860
inter married with them and slaved some of them and ultimately absorbed them

21
00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:20.970
into the population rather than just killing them all or driving them all out

22
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.870
through of course, lots of that happened too, in a situation like that.

23
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.350
It's hard to imagine that English was not influenced by Celtic,

24
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.640
especially since Celts must have formed the majority of the population when

25
00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:35.550
large numbers of people adopt the language of their rulers,

26
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.460
their native language normally functions as a substrate,

27
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.610
meaning that it leaves its Mark on the new language they adopt.

28
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.150
They learned the new language imperfectly with interference from their native

29
00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:45.984
language.

30
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.950
So are there any features of English that likely come from a Celtic language

31
00:01:49.951 --> 00:01:53.730
substrate if we focus on vocabulary then no, not really.

32
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.120
There are only a handful of Celtic words in English from that period.

33
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.500
And honestly, I've never heard anyone use any of those words except for been.

34
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.670
There are however,

35
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.900
a couple of curious grammatical features in English that seem uncannily similar

36
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:11.160
to features in to Celtic languages. Well shan't Cornish. The first one is,

37
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.660
do support the use of what John McWhorter calls the meaningless do

38
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.720
in English or do is inserted into many yes or no questions and negative

39
00:02:20.721 --> 00:02:23.210
statements. Like, do you drink coffee?

40
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.770
Have you ever thought about why do appears in that sentence in many languages of

41
00:02:27.771 --> 00:02:32.150
the world you form yes or no questions by simply saying a statement with raised

42
00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:36.410
in donation, something like you drink coffee in English. Of course,

43
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:39.290
in English you drink coffee. It is something people say,

44
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.040
but for a specific purpose to check that they've understood correctly when they

45
00:02:43.041 --> 00:02:45.590
hear something surprising. But in other languages,

46
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.370
that's the regular way to ask a question with no such special purpose,

47
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.400
for example, in it Kalyan, baby and cafe.

48
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.880
This is the same as the statement baby in cafe,

49
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.820
but with raised intonation in some,

50
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.220
there's a question Margaret that goes before or after the sentence, for example,

51
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.120
in standard Arabic, you might add how before the sentence, hello.

52
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.170
[inaudible] or you can say it without the question. Marker.

53
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.290
So it's the same as a statement, but with rising intonation,

54
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.730
that should [inaudible].

55
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.460
And there are other question forming constructions like ESCA in French

56
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.870
literally, is it that [inaudible] you cafe or more formally,

57
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:29.020
you might use inversion instead? What do you do cafe,

58
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.370
but none of them use the equivalent of the verb do except for two languages.

59
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.900
Well, Shen Cornish Welsh doesn't use the meaningless do in the present tense,

60
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.240
but it does in the past tense. For example,

61
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.360
if it's word for word it,

62
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.360
did you drink coffee the morning?

63
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.710
This notice that this word nest is the past tense of the verb,

64
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.670
meaning do it's also used in negatives in English. For example,

65
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.760
I don't drink coffee in many other languages.

66
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.290
A simple negation word would be added something like I not drink coffee.

67
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.120
For example, in Hebrew, uh Nilo shall take coffee again.

68
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.930
No other languages in the world use the equivalent of the verb do as an

69
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:15.010
auxiliary in a negative sentence, except for well Shen Cornish.

70
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.660
Here's an example in Welsh.

71
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:18.723
<v 1>Coffee, but.</v>

72
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.300
<v 0>This means I didn't drink coffee this morning word for word it.</v>

73
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.290
Did I not drink coffee? The morning this,

74
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.450
as we saw before this word ness is the past tense of the verb. Meaning do,

75
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:32.620
but again, in Welsh,

76
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.420
the verb do is only used as an auxiliary in the past tense in

77
00:04:37.421 --> 00:04:37.810
English.

78
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.190
We also sometimes use the verb do as an auxiliary in affirmative sentences in

79
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:46.870
order to show emphasis like I did wash the dishes, something you might say,

80
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:51.070
if your spouse asks, why didn't you wash the dishes in Welsh and Cornish?

81
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.810
The equivalent of do is use generally not only to show emphasis, for example,

82
00:04:55.811 --> 00:04:56.644
in Welsh.

83
00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.480
<v 1>[Inaudible] word.</v>

84
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.300
<v 0>For word it did I wash the dishes?</v>

85
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.710
This could mean I did wash the dishes with emphasis or simply I washed the

86
00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:07.150
dishes without emphasis.

87
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.900
So that might seem like a weak link between English and Celtic because in

88
00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:14.830
English it's only used for emphasis, but it used to be used in the regular,

89
00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:18.760
affirmative and English too. That means it was used without adding emphasis.

90
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.610
It was just a normal way to express the present tense.

91
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.650
Like these examples written in early modern English doubt that the sun doth move

92
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.160
and the serpent that did sting thy father's life.

93
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.470
These are lines from Shakespeare's Hamlet.

94
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.130
Neither of them are in phatic by the year 1700.

95
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.470
This usage had fallen out of use in English,

96
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.190
but until then English resembled Celtic a little more than it does now,

97
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.520
could these similarities be mere coincidence? Well,

98
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.060
that would be a reasonable assumption if do support occurred in various

99
00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:53.080
languages throughout the world. But as far as we know, it only occurs in Welsh,

100
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.460
Cornish and English.

101
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.370
And since English was superimposed onto a Celtic speaking land,

102
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.280
the same land work Cornish and Welsh developed,

103
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.640
then it makes sense that Celtic is the source of that feature in English.

104
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.080
Another odd feature of English is the exclusive use of the ING form.

105
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.890
The present continuous form to refer to an action in the present moment.

106
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.670
If we think about what the present continuous really expresses in English,

107
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.900
it is in a sense,

108
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.890
the only true present tense to talk about what you are doing in this moment.

109
00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:25.220
Right now you say something like I am working out at the gym.

110
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.810
I work out at the gym is not something a native speaker would ever say to talk

111
00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:33.950
about the present moment that refers to general time to something you do on a

112
00:06:33.951 --> 00:06:37.820
regular basis. So how is English special in this regard?

113
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.330
After all lots of languages have a present continuous form, don't they,

114
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.760
the differences that in other languages,

115
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.230
the present continuous form is used to emphasize that the action is ongoing in

116
00:06:48.231 --> 00:06:52.220
the present moment, but you can still use the simple present and it's correct.

117
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:54.620
It just lacks emphasis, for example,

118
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.300
in Spanish you'll [inaudible] meaning I am eating this

119
00:06:59.301 --> 00:07:02.390
form emphasizes that the action is happening right now,

120
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.530
but it's also fine to say you'll Como, which is the simple present form.

121
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.350
How about in Welsh and Cornish?

122
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.460
There are similar to English in that they use the equivalent of the English

123
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.760
progressive form to indicate an action in the present moment.

124
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.840
One difference is that they include a preposition, for example, in Welsh,

125
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.810
which means he is running word for word it's. Is he in running?

126
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.530
So literally it's more like he is in running in English.

127
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.340
There used to be a preposition like this too. Like I am on running,

128
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:38.600
which gradually morphed into I am a running and then the preposition was lost

129
00:07:38.601 --> 00:07:40.190
entirely. I am running.

130
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.910
If we compare the older English structure to the current one in Welsh and

131
00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:47.570
Cornish, it's more similar than the current form in old English.

132
00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:52.250
We could say this each Aleme on [inaudible] that's like saying I am on

133
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:55.220
hunting rather than I am hunting in modern English.

134
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.200
There's more to it than that.

135
00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:02.030
The Celtic progressive is formed with the equivalent of the verb to be followed

136
00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:06.650
by a preposition and a verbal. Now, rather than a participle in English,

137
00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.850
there were originally two ways to form the progressive a participle ending with,

138
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:12.500
and day. For example,

139
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:17.120
each [inaudible] like I am hunting and a verbal Mt.

140
00:08:17.121 --> 00:08:19.670
Structure. Each Aleme on [inaudible]

141
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.670
. Other Germanic languages have retained their equivalent of the end day

142
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.670
 participle, but in English it came to be replaced by the verbal noun

143
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:20.503
 with ING, which now functions as both the verbal noun and a participle.

144
00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:36.890
So English lost the form that resembled Celtic less and replaced it with the

145
00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:41.090
form that closely resembled Celtic, that much is clear. The question is,

146
00:08:41.091 --> 00:08:43.790
did this happen due to Celtic influence or some other?

147
00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:48.710
Cause the case for Celtic influence seems quite convincing people who question

148
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.820
the Celtic influence hypothesis usually points out that the contact between

149
00:08:52.821 --> 00:08:56.910
Anglo-Saxons and the Celts took place hundreds of years before those features

150
00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:59.970
started to appear in written English. For the most part,

151
00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:03.660
it wasn't until the middle English period that these Celtic racism started to

152
00:09:03.661 --> 00:09:05.790
appear. And for hundreds of years old,

153
00:09:05.791 --> 00:09:09.630
English was written without any real indication of a Celtic substrate.

154
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:13.890
If the Celts had influenced English, then why didn't it affect old English?

155
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:14.580
Well,

156
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.760
that could be because of the difference between the spoken language and the

157
00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:19.490
written language English,

158
00:09:19.491 --> 00:09:23.720
as we know it is the written literary language of those days and was certainly

159
00:09:23.721 --> 00:09:28.400
much more conservative than the spoken language isms may have been in common use

160
00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:29.660
amongst the common people.

161
00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:33.800
Wildly elite scribes saw those innovations as a vulgar and continued to write

162
00:09:33.801 --> 00:09:36.620
old English pretty much the same way it had always been written.

163
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:38.270
Most people were illiterate.

164
00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:42.380
So it was highly unlikely that they felt the need to speak like books or could

165
00:09:42.381 --> 00:09:45.980
have even if they had wanted to. But after the Norman long quest,

166
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:50.030
French became the language of the elite for hundreds of years and written

167
00:09:50.031 --> 00:09:51.650
English lost its prestige.

168
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.860
It's likely that when English later regained its status,

169
00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:59.360
it was free to be written as it was really spoken because literary old English

170
00:09:59.361 --> 00:10:01.460
had been left unused for a long time.

171
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:05.780
So the Celtic elements that had been part of spoken English all along were now

172
00:10:05.781 --> 00:10:10.430
suddenly part of the written language too. So what do I think? Well,

173
00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:14.090
I'm quite convinced that Celtic must have had some influence on English and

174
00:10:14.091 --> 00:10:16.970
these Kelda systems that we've looked at are quite compelling.

175
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.340
I do have a couple of reservations though.

176
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.970
First while Welsh uses do support in the past tense,

177
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.040
it does not use it in the present tense,

178
00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.060
which makes its link to English seem weaker. English doesn't just have,

179
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.730
did support. It has do support. Also,

180
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.780
there are other ways to express the past tense and Welsh sentences with do

181
00:10:35.781 --> 00:10:39.470
support, can be used for both emphatic and non-empathetic sentences,

182
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:44.090
but they don't have to be used for either in English do as required in many

183
00:10:44.091 --> 00:10:48.920
contexts. Another reservation I have is that while English has both the present

184
00:10:48.921 --> 00:10:52.460
progressive and the simple present tense that is used for statements about

185
00:10:52.461 --> 00:10:55.760
general time, as well as for state of verbs Welsh,

186
00:10:55.790 --> 00:11:00.020
doesn't use different forms to distinguish between general time and an action in

187
00:11:00.021 --> 00:11:02.390
the present moment. So this makes me wonder,

188
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:06.770
is it really a progressive form or is it simply the all-purpose present tense

189
00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:11.120
and just structurally resembles the English present? Progressive of course,

190
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.940
nobody is saying that modern Welsh influenced English,

191
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.840
but rather that an early form of Welsh and other Celtic languages influenced

192
00:11:17.841 --> 00:11:21.290
English. So I guess it's normal that the links would have some weaknesses.

193
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.640
Some people are bound to ask why this video focuses on Welsh as a point of

194
00:11:25.641 --> 00:11:29.210
comparison. What about Irish and Scottish Gaelic? Well,

195
00:11:29.211 --> 00:11:30.860
Gaelic developed in Ireland.

196
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:34.880
So it wasn't Gaelic that the Anglo-Saxons had the most contact with,

197
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.710
but rather protonic languages,

198
00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:41.240
the precursors of Welch and Cornish and Welsh and Cornish existed

199
00:11:41.241 --> 00:11:45.620
alongside English as they developed. So what about Cornish? Well,

200
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.200
Cornish isn't widely spoken anymore and in fact,

201
00:11:48.201 --> 00:11:50.630
it's not spoken as a native language at all anymore,

202
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.820
so it's difficult to find information on it.

203
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.680
And it's difficult to find coroner speakers who can help with the sentences in a

204
00:11:56.681 --> 00:11:59.260
video like this, the question of the day,

205
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:02.320
what do you think of the similarities between Celtic and English?

206
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:06.040
Did they convince you that Celtic languages have influenced English live your

207
00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:08.860
reactions in the comments down below a very special,

208
00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:12.200
