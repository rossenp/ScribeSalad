5
00:00:15.421 --> 00:00:19.860
we're going to talk about the Danish language so I can explore my Danish roots.

6
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.200
<v 1>No, no, I am Danish. No, wait,</v>

7
00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:28.400
my name is Danish.

8
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:33.920
<v 0>Uh, yeah, I can't say that.</v>

9
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.840
Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lang focus channel. And my name is Paul today.

10
00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:49.070
We're going to focus on the Danish language to Dennis this ball,

11
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.130
or just dense as it's called in Danish.

12
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.480
There are around 6 million native speakers of Danish, mainly in Denmark,

13
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.770
including Greenland,

14
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.970
but also in the state of shoelace V Holstine in Northern Germany.

15
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.270
It's also an official language in the Faroe islands though.

16
00:01:05.271 --> 00:01:09.140
It's learned as a second language. They're just like Swedish and Norwegian.

17
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.050
Danish is a continental North Germanic language.

18
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.430
It has historically formed a dialect continuum with Swedish and Norwegian and on

19
00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:18.170
paper. It's very similar to them,

20
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.700
but when spoken it's normally quite difficult for Swedish and Norwegian speakers

21
00:01:22.701 --> 00:01:25.370
to understand because of its complex phonology,

22
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.810
a common joke is that Dane sounded like they're speaking with a potato stuck in

23
00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:32.210
their throat or with a mouth full of porridge.

24
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.350
That's partly because lots of the phonemes that Swedish and Norwegian speakers

25
00:01:36.351 --> 00:01:40.280
would clearly pronounce. It seems to be slurred or even disappear in Danish,

26
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.300
but as we'll see later, many of those pronunciation quirks are systematic.

27
00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:46.340
And at least to some extent, predictable,

28
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.150
the North dramatic languages all descended from old Norse,

29
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.270
which developed from prodo Germanic by the eighth century.

30
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.130
Some variation began to develop an old North and it diverged into old West,

31
00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.780
North and old East North,

32
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.370
which diverged into old Danish and old Swedish by around the 13th century.

33
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.920
As I mentioned in my video on Swedish,

34
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.010
all these North's is sometimes referred to as either runic,

35
00:02:10.011 --> 00:02:13.250
Swedish or runic Danish, depending on its location.

36
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.390
This name reflects the fact that it was written in the runic alphabet by the

37
00:02:17.391 --> 00:02:21.350
time Danish had developed into a separate language from Swedish in the 13th

38
00:02:21.351 --> 00:02:22.070
century,

39
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.090
the written language of Denmark was Latin and Danish was mainly written in the

40
00:02:26.091 --> 00:02:27.470
Latin alphabet though.

41
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.090
It continued to be written with runes to a limited extent in the mid 14th

42
00:02:32.091 --> 00:02:35.990
century, Danish began to be used as an administrative language though.

43
00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:38.240
The written language was not yet standardized.

44
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.530
So dialectical variation and different spelling choices were evident in writing

45
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.000
and just like Swedish and Norwegian Danish vocabulary was significantly

46
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:51.680
influenced by low German during the Hanseatic expansion in the 16th

47
00:02:51.681 --> 00:02:52.250
century,

48
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.970
Latin ceased to be the exclusive language of Christianity because of the

49
00:02:55.971 --> 00:03:00.790
Protestant reformation and the first Danish Bible published in 1550

50
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.520
as was the case with many languages of Europe.

51
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.420
This went a long way towards making Danisha literary language and towards

52
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:10.120
standardizing it. But during this time,

53
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.380
the characteristic phonological features that set Danish apart from Swedish and

54
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:18.010
Norwegian were also developing in the following centuries.

55
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.670
Numerous Danish grammars were written as well as an increasing amount of

56
00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:23.860
literature in the 17th century.

57
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.450
The variety of Danish used by the Danish chancellery became the defacto standard

58
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:32.380
language and served as the basis for as standard.

59
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:33.550
Danish is called today.

60
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.020
One noteworthy feature of this variety of Danish was the uvular R sound.

61
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.180
Unlike the rolled R in other words,

62
00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:43.780
the alveolar R which is used in most areas of Sweden and Norway,

63
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.430
universal education,

64
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.630
increased literacy and national broadcasting in the 20th century spread the

65
00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:51.460
standard language to every region,

66
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.400
making the language fairly uniform throughout the country.

67
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.270
Dialects are now mainly limited to elderly speakers in certain areas.

68
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.740
Danish is well-known for being difficult to pronounce and difficult to

69
00:04:04.741 --> 00:04:09.510
understand due to its relatively complex phonology people often describe it as

70
00:04:09.511 --> 00:04:11.340
not being clearly enunciated.

71
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.780
One book that I've seen prefers the euphemisms soft and indistinct,

72
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.880
and many sounds become reduced or dropped in Danish, for example, this word,

73
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.900
meaning product. So take a look at the spelling and imagine what it sounds like.

74
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.060
Well, here's how it sounds in Danish.

75
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.310
There is far from being a one-to-one relationship between letters and sounds.

76
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.820
You have to learn the sounds that various letter combinations make too,

77
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.270
as well as the way certain sounds change depending on the other sounds

78
00:04:39.271 --> 00:04:42.900
surrounding them. Do you remember this phrase from the beginning of the video,

79
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.550
we'll run the flu meaning red fruit pudding with cream pay attention to the D

80
00:04:47.551 --> 00:04:49.170
sounds we'll run the flu.

81
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.220
The Danish D is pronounced in a few different ways at the beginning of a

82
00:04:53.221 --> 00:04:57.390
syllable. It sounds like the, or maybe like without aspiration,

83
00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.040
it's pronounced in a different way.

84
00:04:59.041 --> 00:05:02.310
When it comes after a vowel in a syllable Coda. In other words,

85
00:05:02.311 --> 00:05:04.110
it's not at the beginning of a syllable.

86
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.880
This is the soft D sound in many books and courses it's

87
00:05:08.881 --> 00:05:12.180
described as a soft sound like an English. The,

88
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.930
but it really doesn't sound like that. Listen to this example, meaning fat.

89
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.820
So the soft D is often perceived as an L sound law by

90
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.110
non-native speakers.

91
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.030
It's typically a valorized laminal alveolar approximate rather than trying to

92
00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:28.680
wrap our heads around what that is.

93
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.950
Let's just think about how to make a good attempt at producing it.

94
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.320
When you make a voice, the sound,

95
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.440
the tip of your tongue is between your upper and lower teeth.

96
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.960
But when you make the Danish soft D sound,

97
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.140
the tip of your tongue touches the back of your lower teeth.

98
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.790
And as you're making the sound,

99
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.640
the rest of your tongue kind of rises and moves forward,

100
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.680
bringing it close to the roof of your mouth,

101
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.800
your tongue never fully contacts the roof of your mouth,

102
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.860
making it an approximate rather than a fricative D is also not pronounced

103
00:05:57.861 --> 00:06:02.750
after L or N or before T or S for example, in ELA,

104
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.760
meaning an age Sen,

105
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.260
meaning the devil G is also soft at the end of words.

106
00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:11.810
And between voice sounds in a syllable Coda,

107
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.610
that means its place of articulation opens up and it changes from a stop to an

108
00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:20.510
approximate it's almost silent or silent. For example,

109
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.980
it meaning a choice and they meaning bake

110
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.960
G is also pronounced as one of the two vowel elements in several diphthongs.

111
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.190
As we'll see in a minute, the letter V is also pronounced as an approximate,

112
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.370
not usually a fricative Viva, for example,

113
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.750
V is silent after L for example.

114
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.530
So meaning self and meaning floor.

115
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.810
It's also silent after the vowel.

116
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.250
Oo and V is pronounced as the second element in some diphthongs,

117
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.870
as we'll see in a minute at the beginning of words are as pronounced as

118
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.600
a voiced uvular fricative or a voiced uvular approximate

119
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.950
at the back of the throat. For example, at the end of words,

120
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.380
it's pronounced as a vowel for example,

121
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.600
and that's also true after a vowel in a syllable Coda, vowels,

122
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.210
Danish vowels can be either short or long,

123
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.940
and many of them can be pronounced more than one way,

124
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.000
depending on the other sounds adjacent to them. For example,

125
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:27.290
when the letter a comes before or after R it's pronounced, ah,

126
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.560
for example, in other contexts,

127
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.340
it's pronounced more like app when it's a short vowel than sphere.

128
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.030
And it's more like a, when it's a long vowel, for example,

129
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:44.000
meaning paint E is pronounced a either as a short or long vowel

130
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:49.100
it's, but can also be either short or long after our says,

131
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.400
and it can be pronounced as a Schwab or become silent at the end.

132
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:54.760
<v 1>May day.</v>

133
00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.040
<v 0>Danish stands out amongst the continental North Germanic languages for having</v>

134
00:08:00.041 --> 00:08:02.920
lots of diphthongs. There are two categories,

135
00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:07.600
those with E as the second element, and those with OU as the second element.

136
00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.360
<v 1>Hi, my</v>

137
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.400
no ULI blue

138
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:22.690
SU UWA stolen lo Bo,

139
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.290
how, how Gail.

140
00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:31.090
<v 0>Notice that there are many cases when a combination of a vowel plus G or V</v>

141
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.170
represents a diphthong that's because at least in some contexts they are

142
00:08:35.171 --> 00:08:38.650
approximates then because approximates are close to vowels,

143
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.980
the vowel plus approximate combinations become diphthongs.

144
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:46.060
Unlike Swedish and Norwegian, Danish does not have pitch accent,

145
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.490
but it does have phony mix stress accent.

146
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:52.210
The meanings of some words are distinguished by differences in stress.

147
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:53.403
For example.

148
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.760
<v 1>It is one.</v>

149
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.630
<v 0>Unique phonological feature of Danish that other North Germanic languages don't</v>

150
00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:02.370
have is called stew.

151
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:06.570
This is like a glottal stop without complete closure of the vocal chords

152
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.220
resulting in what's described as a creaky voice it's phonemic and its presence

153
00:09:11.221 --> 00:09:15.240
can distinguish words that otherwise sound the same. For example, Hoon,

154
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.300
meaning she versus who meaning dog.

155
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:19.740
<v 1>Hoon, who.</v>

156
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:25.860
<v 0>Maya meaning me versus my meaning may as in the month of may,</v>

157
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.760
it can appear in syllables with a long vowel or in syllables with a short vowel

158
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.440
followed by a voiced consonant.

159
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.010
This phonological feature is not present in some dialects,

160
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.320
specifically Southern Danish dialects.

161
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:44.910
Now let's look at some sentences in order to examine some of the grammatical

162
00:09:44.911 --> 00:09:45.960
features of Danish.

163
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.310
I film meaning I saw a film word for word it's.

164
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.020
I saw a film.

165
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:57.270
The word order is the same as an English S V O N is the indefinite

166
00:09:57.271 --> 00:10:01.320
article. The definite equivalent of this sentence is cinnamon.

167
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.730
Meaning I saw the film.

168
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:07.170
The definite article is a suffix that attaches to the end of the now unlike the

169
00:10:07.171 --> 00:10:11.190
definite article in English that comes before the now Danish has two genders,

170
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:15.840
common gender and neuter. Gender is a common gender now for our neuter.

171
00:10:15.841 --> 00:10:17.130
Now the article is.

172
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.410
<v 1>It's also who's.</v>

173
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:24.390
<v 0>I saw a house notice that the pronunciation of the articles becomes reduced</v>

174
00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:28.380
in full sentences since they're not emphasized as keywords. Yeah.

175
00:10:28.381 --> 00:10:30.420
So I saw the house,

176
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:33.870
plural nouns also taken definite and definite endings,

177
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:38.100
but rather than depending on gender, they fall into one of three now in classes.

178
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:43.050
Yeah. So I saw two films. Yeah. So the minute I saw the films,

179
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.310
this non-class takes no suffix on the indefinite plural and the suffix,

180
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:52.200
the unit on the definite plural. I saw two houses.

181
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:56.220
Yeah. So whose I saw the houses in this now in class,

182
00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.360
the indefinite form has the suffix, but pronounced like a Schwab.

183
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.580
And the definite form has the suffix.

184
00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:07.400
<v 1>Nana in Bo bone, Briana.</v>

185
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:08.480
<v 0>This class,</v>

186
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:13.070
the indefinite form takes the suffix and the definite form takes the suffix.

187
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:16.850
There were also some irregular nouns with different plural forms.

188
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.820
<v 1>Yeah. So it wouldn't fantastic. You feel them?</v>

189
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:25.040
<v 0>I saw the fantastic film word for word. I saw that fantastic film.</v>

190
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.050
When an adjective is used in a sentence,

191
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:31.310
the definite article suffix is replaced by a standalone definite article that

192
00:11:31.311 --> 00:11:32.150
comes before the,

193
00:11:32.151 --> 00:11:36.860
now the common gender one is then the neuter one is D the

194
00:11:36.861 --> 00:11:39.290
plural one is D for both genders.

195
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:42.410
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

196
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.710
<v 0>Tomorrow. He's flying to London word for word it's tomorrow,</v>

197
00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.510
fly QI to London.

198
00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.990
The sentences we saw before followed SVO word order,

199
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:55.660
but not every sentence is SVO rather the continental North Germanic languages

200
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.310
feature V2 world order.

201
00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.750
That means that if an adverb or another element of the sentence comes first,

202
00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.130
the verb will come next.

203
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:07.240
And the subject will come after the verb in Danish and the other North Germanic

204
00:12:07.241 --> 00:12:09.460
languages. This applies to main clauses,

205
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.430
but not to embedded clauses though in Icelandic,

206
00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:16.990
it applies to both before we saw the first person singular

207
00:12:16.991 --> 00:12:21.640
subject pronoun. And here we see the third person, singular subject pronoun,

208
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.390
Danish, personal pronouns are similar to those of English,

209
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:29.470
except that the equivalent of it has both common gender and neuter forms.

210
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.020
And there's a second person, plural pronoun,

211
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.590
which standard English doesn't have, of course in vernacular English.

212
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:38.650
People have different ways of expressing the second person, plural,

213
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.620
like you all y'all you guys, et cetera.

214
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:46.480
But none of those are really part of the standard language Angie finished in

215
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:49.630
COVID. He can't find his suitcase word for word it.

216
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.270
He cannot find his suitcase.

217
00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:56.770
This possessive scene is not on the chart. It's an additional third person,

218
00:12:56.771 --> 00:12:59.170
singular possessive adjective and pronoun,

219
00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:02.860
which indicates that the subject of the sentence is the possessor.

220
00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:07.120
So this sentence means that he can't find his own suitcase in this sentence.

221
00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:10.720
The meaning is that he can't find a different person.

222
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:13.330
Suitcase scene is common gender,

223
00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:18.040
but there's a neuter gender equivalent seats and the plural equivalent scene.

224
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.220
There are equivalents of these in Swedish and Norwegian as well.

225
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:26.470
Notice the negative marker here, which comes after the auxiliary verb. Ken,

226
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.180
in this particular case,

227
00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:32.170
the English syntax is the same since we say can't or cannot,

228
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.470
but in many present tense sentences in English we use do not.

229
00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:40.180
While Danish doesn't use any equivalent of do almost no languages do

230
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:43.390
in Danish. The negative always comes after.

231
00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.790
<v 1>The verb. These busy, we don't.</v>

232
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.490
<v 0>Eat meat. How about the verb itself?</v>

233
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:52.780
As in Swedish and Norwegian verbs are not conjugated for person or number.

234
00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:56.380
So this present tense verb is exactly the same,

235
00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:00.880
no matter who the subject is in the past, it's always crooner, et cetera.

236
00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:03.880
Regular verbs are divided into two classes.

237
00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.330
Those which end in T E and those which end in EDU.

238
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:12.570
<v 1>Species's eat speeds to eight who's drew. Remember who's who.</v>

239
00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:17.100
<v 0>Remembered and just drove up. [inaudible] his suitcase.</v>

240
00:14:17.101 --> 00:14:21.690
Wasn't found word for word. His suitcase became not found.

241
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.310
This is a passive sentence.

242
00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:28.020
The passive here is formed by using the verb blue to become plus the past

243
00:14:28.021 --> 00:14:32.700
participle meaning found another way to form the passive is by adding

244
00:14:32.701 --> 00:14:36.570
S to the active form for regular verbs. Or in this case, E S.

245
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:39.600
<v 1>Sent found fenders was found.</v>

246
00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.540
<v 0>But this passive form takes on a different meaning.</v>

247
00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:44.730
So this would actually mean existed.

248
00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:49.470
So the form with you is the only one to use here and.

249
00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:52.130
<v 1>Heartfulness less. Ooh, econ. He has only.</v>

250
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.590
<v 0>50 Euros in cash word for word.</v>

251
00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.950
He has only 50 Euro in cash.

252
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.230
Notice the word for 50 and Danish.

253
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:05.150
Danish has a very unusual way of forming numbers from 50 to 100,

254
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.940
which is not found in the other North dramatic languages.

255
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:11.810
They developed from multiples of 20, rather than multiples of 10.

256
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:16.730
The word for 50 means something like half, three times,

257
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.140
meaning three times 20 minus half of 2060 is

258
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:26.300
says, meaning three times three times 2070 is, has jazz.

259
00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:29.930
Meaning half, four, times 80 is CS,

260
00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:33.920
meaning four times 90 years, meaning half,

261
00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:36.890
five times in the equivalent ordinal numbers.

262
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.380
We can see the unappreciated form of the numbers,

263
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.360
which shows their etymology 50.

264
00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.140
<v 1>As, as June, since.</v>

265
00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:49.120
<v 0>Is the genitive of soon, which means times, but it's an archaic word.</v>

266
00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.850
The modern word is, and it's generated.

267
00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.600
<v 1>Form is Gunness 60th it's classes,</v>

268
00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:57.190
tune 70th.

269
00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:02.080
How disasters June 80th fuses junar 90th had a fem since

270
00:16:02.081 --> 00:16:02.914
June.

271
00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.970
<v 0>If you're familiar with either of the other continental North Germanic languages</v>

272
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.380
that I'm sure it's obvious to you,

273
00:16:08.381 --> 00:16:10.720
that Danish is similar to them for the most part,

274
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.480
with some difference in grammar spelling,

275
00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:15.580
a little bit more difference in vocabulary.

276
00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:18.010
And most of all differences in pronunciation,

277
00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:22.000
the phonological developments that have taken place in Danish mean that one

278
00:16:22.001 --> 00:16:24.130
phoneme can have a variety of sounds,

279
00:16:24.131 --> 00:16:26.380
depending on the other sounds that surround it.

280
00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:30.190
And that the sounds often don't correspond to the spelling of words,

281
00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.910
but hopefully you've seen that there are some patterns to those differences and

282
00:16:33.911 --> 00:16:36.790
that it's far from impossible to learn Danish pronunciation,

283
00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:41.200
especially for speakers of Swedish and Norwegian who have trouble understanding

284
00:16:41.201 --> 00:16:43.510
Danish. I think it would be pretty easy to learn,

285
00:16:43.511 --> 00:16:47.500
to understand it by learning those patterns and then getting lots of exposure to

286
00:16:47.501 --> 00:16:49.600
Danish. The question of the day.

287
00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:52.600
I think I've asked a similar question before in another video,

288
00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:54.010
but for speakers of Danish,

289
00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:57.580
how easy is it for you to communicate with Norwegian and Swedish speakers?

290
00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:01.780
Are you able to adjust your speech so that they can understand you and Norwegian

291
00:17:01.781 --> 00:17:02.740
and Swedish speakers?

292
00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:06.190
Are you able to communicate with Danish speakers and other people?

293
00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.640
What's your impression of Danish, which of its features stand out to you?

294
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.390
I hope this has been an interesting and entertaining look at the Danish

295
00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.690
language, but if you want to develop actual skills in the language,

296
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.980
then click the link in the description to visit Danish class one Oh one or visit

297
00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:23.560
Lang focused.com/danish class.

298
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.700
It's the most extensive Danish course I've ever seen with literally hundreds of

299
00:17:27.701 --> 00:17:31.450
lessons for learners of any level and the lessons get progressively more

300
00:17:31.451 --> 00:17:36.010
challenging as your level improves as the name suggests they're podcast based

301
00:17:36.011 --> 00:17:36.520
lessons,

302
00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.330
which is great for people who like to learn using audio materials and for people

303
00:17:40.331 --> 00:17:42.550
who want to learn on the go these days,

304
00:17:42.551 --> 00:17:46.690
I try to focus much more on audio materials than I used to so that I can build

305
00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:50.640
my listening comprehension and do my best to native pronunciation,

306
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.870
but class one Oh one and pod one Oh one courses offer more than just audio

307
00:17:54.871 --> 00:17:57.030
lessons. They have lots of video lessons,

308
00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:01.860
as well as downloadable books and PDF materials so that you can get visual input

309
00:18:01.861 --> 00:18:05.010
and explanations of all the language introduced in the lessons.

310
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.880
They also have audio recordings of the individual words and phrases.

311
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:13.110
So you can review them individually and you can create vocabulary flashcards

312
00:18:13.111 --> 00:18:16.470
that use spaced repetitions to help you memorize the words more easily.

313
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.350
They also offer quizzes to help you review lessons,

314
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.760
word lists of the most commonly used words and other features for class one Oh

315
00:18:23.761 --> 00:18:25.920
one and pod one Oh one courses in general,

316
00:18:25.921 --> 00:18:30.300
I recommend using the additional tools such as the downloadable lesson notes and

317
00:18:30.301 --> 00:18:34.440
the space repetition flashcards to review and solidify what you learned in each

318
00:18:34.441 --> 00:18:38.040
lesson before moving on to the next one for Danish specifically,

319
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:42.150
I really recommend you focus on the lesson vocabulary words and their recordings

320
00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:46.110
so that you can hear each individual word clearly pronounced and imitate it.

321
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.410
If you have an awareness of the features of Danish pronunciation,

322
00:18:49.411 --> 00:18:51.030
like those mentioned in this video,

323
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:55.170
and then you practice imitating the pronunciation of the individual words while

324
00:18:55.171 --> 00:18:56.370
observing their spelling,

325
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.670
that should be of tremendous help in taking on Danish phonology.

326
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:04.020
I've never learned a language using only a class one Oh one or a pod one Oh one

327
00:19:04.021 --> 00:19:06.390
course, but I'm a member of several of their courses.

328
00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:10.890
And I regularly use them as part of my study program. Lots of content is free,

329
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:14.430
including all new lessons, which are free for the first couple of weeks.

330
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.150
And then if you want access to all the content you can upgrade to a paid

331
00:19:18.151 --> 00:19:21.720
account. I really recommend you check out innovative language courses,

332
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.600
