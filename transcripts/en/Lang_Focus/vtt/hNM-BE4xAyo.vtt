<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.650
<v 1>Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lang focus channel. And my name is Paul today's.</v>

3
00:00:09.651 --> 00:00:13.490
Topic is Jamaican Creole, also known as Patois.

4
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.740
Jamaica is an Island nation in the Caribbean with a population of only around 3

5
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:19.400
million people,

6
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.300
but it's made a cultural impact around the world because of its art forms such

7
00:00:23.301 --> 00:00:26.210
as reggae and dance hall music, as well as dub poetry.

8
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.140
Many English speakers have had the experience of hearing someone from Jamaica,

9
00:00:30.141 --> 00:00:33.290
speak and understanding a little bit of it, but not most of it.

10
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.800
<v 2>I mean, not in good Tal why then people are really, really, we could not tell</v>

11
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.870
[inaudible] tell us about why they started feeding the Pitney Gardner.

12
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.070
<v 1>That's because Patois partly descended from English, but not entirely.</v>

13
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.360
It's an English based Creole language that developed in the 17th and 18th

14
00:00:53.361 --> 00:00:57.110
centuries through contact between African slaves and English speaking,

15
00:00:57.111 --> 00:00:57.944
slave owners,

16
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.090
the Island of Jamaica was first colonized by the Spanish who brought the first

17
00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:06.350
African slaves there end in slave to the native title people until they were

18
00:01:06.351 --> 00:01:08.120
wiped out by violence and disease,

19
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.160
but it was after the Island was taken over by Britain in the year 1655 that the

20
00:01:13.161 --> 00:01:17.570
African population rapidly grew as the British brought slaves from West Africa

21
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.430
to work on sugarcane plantations.

22
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.780
These Africans were intentionally separated from others who spoke the same

23
00:01:23.781 --> 00:01:24.590
language as them.

24
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.880
So they wouldn't be able to communicate in secret and plan a rebellion with no

25
00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:29.714
common language.

26
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.740
They did their best under harsh conditions to use the English dialects spoken by

27
00:01:33.741 --> 00:01:34.790
their slave masters.

28
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.660
They didn't learn the language formally and they had to learn the language very

29
00:01:38.661 --> 00:01:41.960
quickly, which resulted in the development of a pigeon language.

30
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.760
They adopted a basic vocabulary of English words and strung them together using

31
00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:49.580
a simplified form of the grammar of their native languages.

32
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.190
Eventually when they had children,

33
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.580
those children learned the simple pigeon language as their native language,

34
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.780
but expanded its features and use making it a living language used for all parts

35
00:01:59.781 --> 00:02:03.680
of life. That was when the pigeon language became a Creole language.

36
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.120
The term pathway comes from French and can be used generally to refer to any

37
00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:09.770
kind of non-standard speech.

38
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.740
But it's also how Jamaicans refer to their Creole language.

39
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.170
Not all Jamaican Patois is the same.

40
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.260
There are various regional and local varieties around the Island.

41
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.400
One reason is that the slave owners spoke various different dialects of English.

42
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.060
Another reason is the mountainous terrain that isolation of the different

43
00:02:26.061 --> 00:02:28.010
plantations and communities from each other.

44
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.260
When a pigeon language becomes a Creole,

45
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.430
it becomes more complex and new features arise to make the language sufficient

46
00:02:34.431 --> 00:02:38.270
for everyday use. That means that in communities, isolated from each other,

47
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.950
the new features might've been different.

48
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.100
Also the official language of Jamaica is not Patois,

49
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.390
but English and Patois is spoken on a continuum with standard Jamaican English.

50
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.250
That means that in some situations,

51
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.340
some speakers will essentially be speaking standard English with a

52
00:02:52.341 --> 00:02:55.580
characteristically Jamaican accent. While in other situations,

53
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.700
some speakers will mix English with varying degrees of Patois.

54
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.090
And at the very casual end of the spectrum,

55
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.020
speakers might use Jamaican Patois exclusively in technical terms,

56
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.890
pure Patois is the basil elect while standard English is the acro elect.

57
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.030
And in the middle lies,

58
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:14.500
the mezzo elect the acro like standard English is the prestige language and the

59
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:19.060
language of social mobility while Patois is sometimes considered to be incorrect

60
00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:20.710
English or improper speech.

61
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.860
But Patois is a distinct language with its own phonology,

62
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:25.720
grammar and vocabulary distinctions.

63
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.700
There's also another form of Patois called Crow Monte or deep Patois,

64
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.530
which was used by the Maroons descendants of slaves who escaped from the Spanish

65
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.400
when the British invaded Jamaica and set up communities deepen the mountains.

66
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.960
This form of Patois is more heavily based in the Aecon language than other forms

67
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:48.760
of Patois. Deep Patois is now used as a ritual language in maroon communities,

68
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.740
but not as a daily spoken language.

69
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.093
<v 3>Vocabulary.</v>

70
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.400
<v 1>We already have Patois vocabulary. It comes from English,</v>

71
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.490
but with pronunciation that has diverged widely from English,

72
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.810
there's technically no standard way to write Patois only general tendencies.

73
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.500
But those differences from English are usually reflected in Patois spelling.

74
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.843
For example.

75
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.600
<v 3>Somebody, somebody, something, something money,</v>

76
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.630
money market market here,

77
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.730
ear open this, this with,

78
00:04:19.731 --> 00:04:21.630
with notice that though.

79
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.800
<v 1>And the sounds of English T H don't exist in Jamaican Patois.</v>

80
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.340
While these spellings may look strange to people who know standard English,

81
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.390
they're actually phonetic representations of speech, unlike English spelling,

82
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.330
which was basically frozen in time several hundred years ago.

83
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.910
And sometimes doesn't reflect current pronunciation,

84
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.380
sometimes words that have a final consonant cluster in English lose a continent

85
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.600
in Patois. For example, respect.

86
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.430
<v 3>Respect. You'll notice that the words are often used differently.</v>

87
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.470
NEF from English enough means many or much no respect.

88
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.070
This means much respect. Shocked is used.

89
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.000
<v 1>That's the general word for speak or talk mic from English.</v>

90
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.470
Mic is used generally for causative. Meaning like both make and let in.

91
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.540
<v 3>English. Let me tell you something.</v>

92
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.890
<v 1>Meaning let me tell you something and notice here there's a different variant of</v>

93
00:05:13.891 --> 00:05:15.090
the word, meaning something.

94
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.410
There are also lots of words that are created by compounding other simple.

95
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.810
<v 3>Words, nozzle, literally.</v>

96
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.190
<v 1>Nose hole. This means nostril on the middle, literally hand middle.</v>

97
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.580
This means the Palm of your.

98
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.040
<v 3>Yeah. I walked off. Literally I water. This means tear already.</v>

99
00:05:32.041 --> 00:05:33.600
I literally read them.

100
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.030
<v 1>This means envious or covetous.</v>

101
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.230
This is actually a lone translation of a phrase in the ICAN language of West

102
00:05:40.231 --> 00:05:41.064
Africa.

103
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.540
[inaudible] and that brings us to words that come from languages other than

104
00:05:45.541 --> 00:05:48.510
English. For example, the word for eat numb.

105
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.100
This word comes from a West African language, perhaps Wolf the word for ghost.

106
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.140
They'll be, this comes from a con.

107
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.070
<v 3>The word for spider on Nanci. This also.</v>

108
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.490
<v 1>Comes from a con the word for clumsy or awkward, but fun.</v>

109
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.360
And there's a sprinkling of words from other languages. For example,

110
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.230
the word meaning child Pitney, which comes from the Portuguese word.

111
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.410
Pecky Nino a diminutive form of the word, pet Kendall,

112
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.030
meaning small variations of this particular word appear in numerous Creole

113
00:06:17.031 --> 00:06:19.400
languages around the world. Grammar.

114
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.270
The basic word order of Patois is similar to that of standard English.

115
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.990
For example, this means I speak Patois.

116
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.950
The word order is subject verb object, as it is in standard English.

117
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:33.320
<v 4>He is eating.</v>

118
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.610
<v 1>The cake again. This is SVO. Let's add a little more information.</v>

119
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.790
<v 4>And my number [inaudible]. He is eating.</v>

120
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.280
<v 1>Cake that I baked this relative clause is introduced by a relative pronoun</v>

121
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.730
wa, which is the question where it meaning what in English.

122
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.850
It would be strange to use what in this context, but we might use,

123
00:06:51.851 --> 00:06:56.830
which notice that there's a definite article before the word cake D this is

124
00:06:56.831 --> 00:07:00.910
the equivalent of the in English. There's also an indefinite article, ah,

125
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.740
which is the obvious equivalent of standard English. Ah, this word here, ah,

126
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.860
looks like the indefinite article, but it's not it's.

127
00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:13.630
The equivalent of English is in English is before a present participant

128
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.590
indicates the present progressive that an action is ongoing, ah,

129
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.030
functions the same way in Patois, placing it before a verb makes it progressive.

130
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.000
Instead of, ah, another word day can also be.

131
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.833
<v 4>Used.</v>

132
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.770
<v 1>This also means he's eating the cake day,</v>

133
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.660
comes from the egg bowl language from the word deep meaning to be, ah,

134
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:37.450
and they are both used as the copula as well.

135
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.030
Those slightly differently from each other, ah,

136
00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:43.000
is used for equative sentences in my doctor.

137
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.440
He's the doctor de is used with a locative meaning in other words,

138
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.690
indicating location, as in the sentence

139
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.970
there in Kingston here, the word ah, is not a copywriter,

140
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.050
but rather a preposition meaning in or at with adjectives,

141
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.880
a cappella isn't needed this,

142
00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.540
this sentence doesn't have the copula. Ah,

143
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.570
the equivalent of is in the standard English translation.

144
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:12.670
Also notice the demonstrative pronoun Desia, which comes from this here.

145
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:17.230
Just, this is also possible. We also see ya after book.

146
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:22.240
It means here another similar sentence is this audible,

147
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.420
meaning this is an old book in the first sentence.

148
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:28.630
The adjective is the predicate. So the copula isn't needed.

149
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:33.820
But if the adjective is part of a noun phrase than a copula is used one,

150
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.110
the number one can also function like an indefinite article. In this case,

151
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:42.220
it would be strange to have, ah, the copula followed by the indefinite article.

152
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:46.090
Ah, one seems a better fit here. Pronouns.

153
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.780
You may have already noticed some personal pronouns that kind of resemble

154
00:08:49.781 --> 00:08:51.610
English ones. The main ones are.

155
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.370
<v 4>You note that IM can be either masculine.</v>

156
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.203
<v 1>Or feminine.</v>

157
00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:02.360
<v 3>We all know them. The most interesting pronoun here is.</v>

158
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.810
<v 1>Because it doesn't come from English. It comes from the egg bowl.</v>

159
00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:09.800
Pronoun [inaudible] note that there is no difference between the subject

160
00:09:09.801 --> 00:09:13.070
pronouns and object pronouns in Patois. So for example,

161
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.280
me is the equivalent of both I and me in English.

162
00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.060
There are also no separate forms for possessive adjectives.

163
00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:25.250
My car is you simply place the same personal pronoun before the noun

164
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:29.690
for possessive pronouns like mine in English, the preposition fee,

165
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.470
which means two or four is used before the pronoun.

166
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:37.340
Not that you are offering me word for word that their car is to me,

167
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.770
but in natural English, that car is mine.

168
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:44.060
The preposition fee is also used before verbs like to in English.

169
00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:46.400
<v 3>He loves.</v>

170
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.950
<v 1>To boast big up is a phrasal verb.</v>

171
00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:53.390
Meaning to give someone a thumbs up or show respect to someone fee is not always

172
00:09:53.391 --> 00:09:56.000
used before a verb where you would have an infinitive in English.

173
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.610
It seems to depend on the verb that comes before.

174
00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.160
And in some cases it seems to be optional.

175
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.710
And since we're on the topic of verbs,

176
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:07.970
there are basically no verb conjugations in Jamaican Patois with the exception

177
00:10:07.971 --> 00:10:10.790
of some words like Phoebe, meaning to be in English,

178
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:15.140
which has a different conjugated form, but still it's only one conjugated form.

179
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.790
Ah, so present tense verbs have just one form regardless of the subject.

180
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.830
<v 3>In the married Emory.</v>

181
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:26.240
<v 1>As we saw before the present progressive can be expressed by adding ah,</v>

182
00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:30.740
before the verb or day he's reading a book.

183
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:35.180
The past tense is sometimes not indicated and needs to be inferred from the

184
00:10:35.181 --> 00:10:38.840
context, but it can be indicated with one of three markers.

185
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:41.030
When did or Ben.

186
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.400
<v 3>Invalid readable, readable.</v>

187
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:48.320
<v 1>These sentences mean he read a book in the simple past the progressive marker,</v>

188
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:52.100
ah, can also be used with the past tense to express the past. Progressive.

189
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:54.440
<v 3>When I read a book, he was.</v>

190
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.490
<v 1>Reading a book. Ben is more like a present. Perfect progressive marker.</v>

191
00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:00.440
<v 3>Ben readable. This means.</v>

192
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.940
<v 1>He has been reading a book.</v>

193
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:07.140
The future is normally expressed using the verb goal. As an English Denmark,

194
00:11:07.141 --> 00:11:09.380
I read a book, they are going to read the book.

195
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.320
Our goal is like are going to in English.

196
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:16.730
And the future is also often expressed using. We like will in English.

197
00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:20.870
Then we read the book. They will read the book and the different sentence.

198
00:11:20.871 --> 00:11:22.790
Since I'm tired of talking about people, reading.

199
00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.450
<v 3>Jonathan asleep on the bed there, John will sleep on that bed.</v>

200
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:27.880
John would sleep on the bed.

201
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:30.110
<v 1>Notice here at the preposition pun,</v>

202
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:33.290
which means on or upon the word it descended from.

203
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:38.090
Also notice that day.day, literally that there, which we saw before.

204
00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:43.090
Notice that that day can be split by the gnome with that coming before and day

205
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.550
coming after questions. Yes or no.

206
00:11:46.551 --> 00:11:49.820
Questions are simple in Patois. You simply raise your intonation.

207
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:53.920
<v 3>You ain't Rob beach. Did you go to the beach? We're forward. It's.</v>

208
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.010
<v 1>You past tense. Marker. Go to beach.</v>

209
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.270
Notice that there's no question in version or use of did as there is in English.

210
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:04.990
It's no different from the sentence. Meaning you went to the beach,

211
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:09.670
except that it has rising into a nation. And again, here we see the word, ah,

212
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:13.840
used as a preposition showing movement towards something like two in English

213
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.760
for open questions, many of the interrogative pronouns. In other words,

214
00:12:18.761 --> 00:12:22.300
question words, resemble English ones with some phonological changes.

215
00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.490
<v 3>What do I do? What are you doing? Where you are going? Where are you going?</v>

216
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.300
Who have the book? Who has the.

217
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:32.910
<v 1>Book? But there are some differences too, like the way to ask why?</v>

218
00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:37.500
Well I'll make from English. What make making my ball? Why is she crying?

219
00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:42.330
Notice the word ball, which in English means to cry loudly or uncontrollably,

220
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.490
but in Patois it just means to cry.

221
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.990
Now that we've had a look at some of the basic features of Jamaican Patois,

222
00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:53.220
let's look at a couple more sentences and see what we discover because I don't

223
00:12:53.221 --> 00:12:55.980
know where my wife is. I have to go cook dinner for myself.

224
00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.610
<v 3>No, and my wife today may have to go cook dinner for myself.</v>

225
00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:00.810
<v 1>Word for word it,</v>

226
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:05.250
because I know no where my wife

227
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:06.720
is locative.

228
00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.860
I have to go cook dinner for myself.

229
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.710
The first word true means because,

230
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.860
and indicates the reason for something me means I,

231
00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:18.840
because it's the subject in the sentence.

232
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.460
No is the basic way of expressing a negative as an English in the simple

233
00:13:23.461 --> 00:13:28.080
present. In other words, for habitual action or States, no is used by itself,

234
00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.000
but with other tenses or aspects,

235
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:32.520
it can combine with the tents or aspect marker.

236
00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:37.290
The present progressive negator is NA a combination of no. And ah,

237
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:38.910
the progressive aspect, marker.

238
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:41.580
This is also used to express negation in the future.

239
00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:46.440
And also Neveah liver is used for the past. Like never in English,

240
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:50.670
in the phrase, me wife, me functions as a possessive adjective.

241
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:55.290
Like my remember that day is the copula that is used for locative,

242
00:13:55.291 --> 00:13:57.030
meaning indicating location.

243
00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:01.170
Huffy means half to a combination of half and fee.

244
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.700
Meaning to Dina means dinner and feed self means for

245
00:14:05.701 --> 00:14:07.200
myself with feet,

246
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.860
meaning two or four and one final sentence.

247
00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:12.930
<v 3>So I'm going to like them people then chapter.</v>

248
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:17.160
<v 1>This means I don't like those people. They talk too much word for word it's.</v>

249
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.170
I know like those people,

250
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.880
they excessively chatty in the sentence. We can see Dem twice,

251
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:27.870
but used in different ways. The first Dem is a demonstrative adjective.

252
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:32.100
Like those in English. In the second instance, it's the subject pronouns.

253
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:36.990
They them is also used in a different context as a plural marker with

254
00:14:36.991 --> 00:14:41.130
them coming after the now they're post them means the cats

255
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:46.860
is them means my ears notice that IAS from English ears is

256
00:14:46.861 --> 00:14:49.620
normally singular in Patois to be made plural.

257
00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:53.930
It's followed by Dem after that chatty chatty chop, the Chuck D.

258
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.510
This is a redo application of the word chatty,

259
00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:01.100
which means chatty redo application is common in Jamaican Patois sometimes to

260
00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:05.450
intensify an adjective like in this case, as you can see,

261
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.570
Jamaican Patois is quite similar to English in many ways.

262
00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:13.100
And with that sliding scale between full-on Patois on the one hand and standard

263
00:15:13.101 --> 00:15:14.900
English on the other certain speakers,

264
00:15:14.901 --> 00:15:18.860
Patois is more mixed with English than others that leads some people to believe

265
00:15:18.861 --> 00:15:23.000
that Patois is nothing but English spoken with a Jamaican accent with a little

266
00:15:23.001 --> 00:15:24.140
bit of slang thrown in,

267
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.610
but the full-on Patois basil elect has its own grammatical features its own

268
00:15:28.611 --> 00:15:32.720
vocabulary and its own phonological features that make it quite distinct from

269
00:15:32.721 --> 00:15:33.560
standard English.

270
00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.970
The question of the day to anyone from Jamaica or Jamaicans living abroad,

271
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:40.040
to what extent do you use Patois?

272
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.260
And to what extent do you use standard English?

273
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:45.500
Does it depend on the situation and to speakers of English,

274
00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:49.010
native speakers or otherwise? What do you think of Jamaican Patois?

275
00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.050
How much of it are you able to understand?

276
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:53.840
I'll add some links in the description of this video.

277
00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.480
So you can hear some more real life samples of Patois.

278
00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:57.980
If you enjoyed this video,

279
00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:01.340
check out the different Lang focused social media accounts like Facebook,

280
00:16:01.341 --> 00:16:04.460
YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera. And as always,

281
00:16:04.461 --> 00:16:07.490
I want to give a very special thanks to my Patrion supporters,

282
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:11.420
especially my top tier Patrion supporters whose names appear right here on the

283
00:16:11.421 --> 00:16:15.110
screen, many special thanks to them and to everyone.

284
00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.320
Thank you for watching and have a nice.

285
00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:18.160
<v 5>No.</v>
