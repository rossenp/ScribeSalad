00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.483
<v 0>Hello, everyone.</v>

2
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.400
<v 1>Welcome to the Lang focus channel.</v>

3
00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:15.020
And my name is Paul today's topic is the Polish language

4
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.620
or [inaudible] as it's called in Polish.

5
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.300
Polish is the official language of the central European country of Poland where

6
00:00:23.301 --> 00:00:28.160
97% of the population speaks it as a native language that makes Poland the

7
00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:32.120
most linguistically homogenous country in Europe. It's the second,

8
00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:36.860
most widely spoken Slavic language after Russian with around 45 million

9
00:00:36.861 --> 00:00:41.480
native speakers and an additional 5000002nd language speakers. As you may know,

10
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.740
Slavic languages are a branch of the Indo-European language family between the

11
00:00:45.741 --> 00:00:49.400
year 500 CE and 1000 CE prodo Slavic,

12
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.360
gradually diverged into dialects. And by 1000 CE,

13
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.640
there were already distinct West Slavic,

14
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.960
East Slavic and South Slavic languages and dialects of these three languages

15
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.720
developed into the languages of each Slavic branch.

16
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.030
The West Slavic languages include Polish Czech, Slovak Serbian,

17
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.070
a minority language in Eastern Germany.

18
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.770
And Kasabian a minority language in Poland.

19
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.570
Poland first became a state in the 10th century around the time that Slavic was

20
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:19.880
developing into various distinct languages.

21
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.710
The unification of various Slavic tribes within one Polish state helped tie

22
00:01:24.711 --> 00:01:27.050
their dialects together as a single language,

23
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.280
the Christianization of Poland took place in the decades following the creation

24
00:01:31.281 --> 00:01:32.270
of the Polish state.

25
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.020
And along with that came Latin V as a Roman Catholic church,

26
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.270
which became the formal written language.

27
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.230
And the language of the nobility Polish continued to be the predominant spoken

28
00:01:42.231 --> 00:01:44.030
language among the general population,

29
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.050
but Latin certainly had some influence on Polish because of its prestigious

30
00:01:48.051 --> 00:01:48.800
position.

31
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.310
Polish was not a written language until the adoption of Christianity and the

32
00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:56.630
arrival of Latin from that point on macular Polish began to be written

33
00:01:56.631 --> 00:01:58.550
informally using the Latin alphabet.

34
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.290
The oldest sample of written Polish that we know of is a list of names dating

35
00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:05.210
back to the year 1136,

36
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.290
the oldest written Polish sentence that we know of dates back to 1270.

37
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.550
There are more substantial texts from the 14th century onwards.

38
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.230
As Polish became more commonly written from the beginnings,

39
00:02:17.231 --> 00:02:20.690
the Latin alphabet was insufficient for writing all the different sounds of

40
00:02:20.691 --> 00:02:22.250
Polish. So over time,

41
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.660
Polish writers began using a variety of diacritics that have become part of the

42
00:02:26.661 --> 00:02:31.400
Polish alphabet and the characteristic part of Polish writing during the yellow

43
00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:35.420
onion dynasty Polish became an official language alongside Latin.

44
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.950
Also during this time,

45
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.870
cities were founded and administered under a German system of law known as muck

46
00:02:41.871 --> 00:02:44.930
divorce law due to the influence of this system of law.

47
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.630
Numerous German words entered Polish German,

48
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.640
lone words in Polish include meaning town, council and boredom,

49
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.800
meaning mayor also there had always been contact with Germanic speakers,

50
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.690
especially in the areas all the way back to prodo Slavic.

51
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.290
So there are other dramatic loan words in Polish that go back a long way.

52
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.700
Latin remained an official language alongside Polish through the Polish

53
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.050
Lithuanian Commonwealth,

54
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.120
but Polish had gradually become more widely used by the nobility than Latin in

55
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:19.600
the 16th century, while Polish was becoming more standardized,

56
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.930
it served as the vehicle for the golden age of Polish literature.

57
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.160
It also became the lingua franca throughout much of central and Eastern Europe

58
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.070
spoken by the ruling classes, not only in Lithuania,

59
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.140
but also in Ukraine and Belarus,

60
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.450
which were mostly part of the Commonwealth at the time.

61
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.570
The third official language of the Commonwealth was Ruthenian,

62
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.590
which was spoken in the Eastern areas and would later develop into Ukrainian and

63
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.790
bellow Russi and dialects Polish was influenced by Ruthenian to some extent,

64
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:50.650
due to contact Poland was erased from the map between seven 95

65
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:54.580
in 1918, after being partitioned between the Russian empire,

66
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.210
Austria and the kingdom of pressure. And later the German empire,

67
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.470
which it was a part of Polish ceased to be an official language anywhere.

68
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.250
And dialectal differences grew in the different occupied parts of Poland.

69
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.020
After the first world war,

70
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.460
the borders of Europe were redrawn and an independent Polish state was restored

71
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.151
lands,

72
00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:17.370
which were considered historically Polish were taken back from occupying powers,

73
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.270
but not all lands borders were once again,

74
00:04:21.271 --> 00:04:23.040
redrawn after world war two,

75
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.960
with the recovered territories being given from Germany to Poland and the Soviet

76
00:04:27.961 --> 00:04:32.100
union occupying Eastern areas and making them part of Belarus and Ukraine,

77
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.380
many poles were forcibly transferred from those neighboring countries to Poland,

78
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.240
transferred to being a euphemism for kicked out this forced transfer of poles

79
00:04:42.241 --> 00:04:46.440
from their homes to different dialect areas resulted in dialect leveling the

80
00:04:46.441 --> 00:04:50.280
loss of dialectal differences and transfer. In other words,

81
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.940
expulsion of non poles to neighboring countries made Poland a very

82
00:04:53.941 --> 00:04:55.560
linguistically homogenous country.

83
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.550
Today four main dialects of Polish are usually recognized,

84
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.140
but the differences are now slight. There's greater Polish, lesser Polish.

85
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.300
I'm a Soviet and Salesian.

86
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.380
Those speakers often consider themselves a separate language community and

87
00:05:10.381 --> 00:05:12.180
sometimes counted as [inaudible],

88
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.550
which is generally considered a separate language,

89
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.230
but as closely related Polish.

90
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.350
So what is Polish like pronunciation and orthography Polish writer

91
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.160
think has a number of characteristic features that are quite striking at first

92
00:05:26.161 --> 00:05:29.010
glance. The Polish alphabet has 32 letters,

93
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.070
but there are also seven diagraphs pairs of letters,

94
00:05:32.071 --> 00:05:36.450
which represent individuals notice that four of those diagraphs feature the

95
00:05:36.451 --> 00:05:38.100
letter Z. This makes sense.

96
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.940
See the most common letter in Polish writing and notice that there are two

97
00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:44.130
additional letters that are derived from Z,

98
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.790
which appear in another two diagraphs. If you include those people,

99
00:05:47.791 --> 00:05:51.180
seeing Polish and writing for the first time will definitely notice the

100
00:05:51.181 --> 00:05:53.370
abundance of Z's and Z like letters.

101
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.830
But those two Z derived letters are not the only special letters in Polish.

102
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.630
There are nine in total. This letter is pronounced womb. While in Polish,

103
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.640
the letter w is normally pronounced.

104
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.300
These letters represent nasal vowels,

105
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.990
more specifically vowels followed by nasal semi vowels.

106
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.490
The exact quality of the nasal sound varies depending on the surrounding sounds.

107
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.380
And the nasal sound is normally absent before wa or in the nasal air

108
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.420
at the end of a word. For example,

109
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.310
this word is normally pronounced Cher and is only pronounced like this shell

110
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.410
in very careful formal speech.

111
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.810
<v 2>There are some noticeably.</v>

112
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.730
<v 1>Long consonant clusters in Polish.</v>

113
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.690
This one has a cluster of five continents in a row best as Glendening,

114
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.910
meaning ruthless. Then there's this one [inaudible] meaning crime.

115
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.280
It has a cluster of only four continents,

116
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.740
but there's also a diagraph in this first cluster,

117
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.800
which makes it appear to have three continents instead of two.

118
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.440
So to someone looking at Polish for the first time,

119
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.530
it probably appears to be full of long consonant clusters,

120
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.480
even though some of them are just diagraphs.

121
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.680
Most simple Polish continents are pronounced like their English equivalents,

122
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:08.000
but note that C is pronounced as, and as I mentioned before,

123
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.080
w is pronounced and also note that the letters X,

124
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.330
V and Q are not used in Polish.

125
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.790
The sound AXA usually represented by X and English is spelled K S in

126
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:20.624
Polish.

127
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.760
One important feature of Polish pronunciation is hard and soft consonants.

128
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.890
A common feature of Slavic languages.

129
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.750
Soft consonants are generally palatalized like a hard consonant pronounced

130
00:07:32.751 --> 00:07:36.590
together with a sound aside from you and LA,

131
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.030
which are always soft,

132
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.710
soft consonants are indicated by an accent above the letter or by an eye

133
00:07:42.711 --> 00:07:47.270
following the continent, for example, so and HSA, no,

134
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.910
and near and Pia.

135
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:54.650
Most of the diagraphs we saw before belong to a subset of hard consonants that

136
00:07:54.651 --> 00:07:57.080
derived from historically soft consonants.

137
00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.710
Why do hard and soft consonants matter? Because in Polish,

138
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.640
some inflectional suffixes are different depending on whether they are proceeded

139
00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:06.860
by a hard consonant or a soft consonant.

140
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:09.350
<v 2>Most continents.</v>

141
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.130
<v 1>Specifically abstruse once stops Africans and fricatives.</v>

142
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:17.060
When they appear in consonant, clusters must all be voiced or voiceless.

143
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:21.590
This results in voice stops truants becoming voiceless when they come before or

144
00:08:21.591 --> 00:08:24.080
after a voiceless consonant, for example.

145
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.100
<v 2>Fiat Orca. This also.</v>

146
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:31.240
<v 1>It happens at the ends of words, this word, meaning car, some, a hoot,</v>

147
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.070
and this word, meaning doctor,

148
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:37.750
this type of devoicing is one of the main things that keeps Polish from being a

149
00:08:37.751 --> 00:08:40.060
fully phonetic language. In other words,

150
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.910
a language in which one grapheme equals one sound.

151
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.350
Another thing is that the distinction between a few sounds has been lost so that

152
00:08:47.351 --> 00:08:49.150
now these letters are pronounced the same.

153
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.070
<v 2>Grammar. Let's start with the word order of Polish. The unmarked.</v>

154
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.360
<v 1>Or neutral word order in Polish is SVO as an English. For example.</v>

155
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.353
<v 3>[Inaudible] meaning.</v>

156
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.540
<v 1>Child is cute, or my child is sweet.</v>

157
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:09.980
The word order here is exactly like an English subject verb compliment.

158
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.730
The sentence has no object, but the adjective here is a compliment.

159
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:19.460
Another example, masters, NY, albeit, which means the man is eating dinner,

160
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:24.440
subject verb object. Notice that there is no definite article in Polish.

161
00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.990
And actually there isn't an indefinite article either.

162
00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.870
Now this is the unmarked or neutral word order,

163
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:32.120
but Polish word order is quite flexible.

164
00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:36.160
And elements of the sentence can be moved in order to emphasize them in the

165
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:39.410
first sentence, we could emphasize my child by moving it to the.

166
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.530
<v 3>End. [inaudible].</v>

167
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.470
<v 1>In the second sentence, we could emphasize, man, by moving it to the.</v>

168
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:47.540
<v 3>End, I'll be out to your is now.</v>

169
00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.960
<v 1>So the sentence is now dinner eats the man,</v>

170
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.330
technically any word order as possible though,

171
00:09:53.331 --> 00:09:57.050
something sound unnatural and would be most suitable for written poetry or

172
00:09:57.051 --> 00:09:57.884
something.

173
00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.790
How can these words be moved around freely like this doesn't that get confusing?

174
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:06.410
The main reason is that Polish is a highly inflected language and nouns.

175
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.580
Among other words have case endings endings that tell us the function of the

176
00:10:10.581 --> 00:10:11.780
word in the sentence,

177
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.780
because the function of the word is obvious from its ending.

178
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.860
And we don't need to use word order or syntax to determine the function of the

179
00:10:18.861 --> 00:10:21.470
word jets means child.

180
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.320
This is the singular form in the nominative case,

181
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:28.610
which is usually used for the subject of a sentence or a predicate adjective

182
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.900
after a linking verb, there are six other cases in Polish genitive,

183
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:35.150
dative, accusative,

184
00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:40.190
instrumental locative invocative. These are the singular forms,

185
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.140
but there are also plural forms.

186
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47.360
It's important to note that Polish has grammatical gender jets is a neuter noun

187
00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:50.240
in their most basic form. The nominative form,

188
00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.840
nutrient nouns end in F L all or, um,

189
00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.230
there are also masculine and feminine nouns,

190
00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:01.160
masculine nouns in their nominative form. Usually end in a continent.

191
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.100
An example is who a buck, meaning boy,

192
00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:08.030
some case endings differ between different types of masculine nouns.

193
00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.380
Compare Coopa,

194
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:13.430
a masculine person to bonk a masculine object.

195
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.130
Notice there's a difference in the accusative. Plural.

196
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.910
The endings are different for masculine people on the one hand and masculine

197
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:22.640
objects and animals on the other for many nouns.

198
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.830
This is also true for the nominative plural.

199
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:29.240
Also notice that the genitive and accusative singular endings are different in

200
00:11:29.241 --> 00:11:32.750
these cases, the endings are different from masculine animate nouns.

201
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:33.590
In other words,

202
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:37.940
humans and animals on the one hand and inanimate objects on the other though,

203
00:11:37.941 --> 00:11:38.930
in the genitive case,

204
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:43.910
a few types of nouns are acceptions feminine announced in their nominative form,

205
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.840
usually end in op or for example, Metallica,

206
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:52.670
meaning mother adjectives also agree with nouns in gender number and

207
00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:56.110
case, and they have their own sets of endings. For example,

208
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.830
more than Metallica means a young mother in the nominative case,

209
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.450
but here's a phrase in the genitive.

210
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.550
<v 3>Case. [inaudible].</v>

211
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:07.900
<v 1>The young mother's child. Not only the noun has a genitive case ending,</v>

212
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:11.830
but so does the adjective and notice that the adjectives genital vending is

213
00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:13.000
different from the nouns,

214
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.990
adjectives have endings for all cases in all genders,

215
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:20.620
for both singular and plural verbs,

216
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:24.040
Polish verbs have two tenses past and non past,

217
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:28.540
but there are also two major aspects which indicate completion of an action,

218
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:33.340
the perfective aspect, or incompletion of an action. The imperfection of aspect,

219
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:38.380
each verb has separate infinitives for the imperfection and perfective aspect.

220
00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:42.430
And then conjugations are built around those infinitives in order to indicate

221
00:12:42.431 --> 00:12:43.810
the tents. In other words,

222
00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.020
the time at which the complete or incomplete action is done,

223
00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.650
let's take a look at the verb, meaning to read, to touch.

224
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.530
This is an imperfection of infinitive. In other words,

225
00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.860
the reading is in progress or ongoing shut, touch.

226
00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:00.490
This is a perfective infinitive, meaning the reading is complete.

227
00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.690
The perfective form of verbs is derived from the imperfect of form by adding a

228
00:13:04.691 --> 00:13:05.620
prefix to it,

229
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.610
or sometimes by adding a suffix or changing a vowel in the verb STEM.

230
00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.190
Now let's conjugate these in the past tense,

231
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.360
you drop the Chuck from the end of the infinitive and add one of these endings

232
00:13:16.361 --> 00:13:21.340
to the remaining STEM. For example, [inaudible] means I was reading.

233
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:25.000
In other words, the reading was ongoing at a certain point in the past.

234
00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:26.950
<v 3>Yep. Such a thumb means. I.</v>

235
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.210
<v 1>Read. In other words,</v>

236
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.990
I completed the action of reading within a certain time period in the past,

237
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:35.380
by the way, please note that Polish is a pro drop language,

238
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.200
meaning that the subject pronoun can often be left out.

239
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.920
And that's because the verb endings often make it clear who the subject is.

240
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:46.240
But something to note is how the verbs are conjugated for gender in the past

241
00:13:46.241 --> 00:13:49.120
tense in the first and second person, singular,

242
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.100
there are masculine and feminine forms.

243
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:55.420
The third person singular also has a neuter form for the plural forms.

244
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.080
The distinction is between masculine personal endings. In other words,

245
00:13:59.081 --> 00:14:00.880
for people and all the others,

246
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.440
a masculine inanimate object or animal will be conjugated the same as for

247
00:14:05.441 --> 00:14:07.980
feminine or neutral nouns. So while a man.

248
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.850
<v 3>Say yes to him, a woman would say Yatra tower.</v>

249
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:16.190
<v 1>And if you're talking to a man, you would say [inaudible],</v>

250
00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:17.580
but if you're talking to a woman,

251
00:14:17.581 --> 00:14:21.870
you would say [inaudible] speakers of other Slavic languages.

252
00:14:21.871 --> 00:14:23.700
Won't see anything strange about this,

253
00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:27.480
but speakers of Germanic and romance languages might need to get used to this.

254
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:32.490
Now let's take a look at the non past conjugations, non past.

255
00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:36.330
What do you mean by non past? Is it present or future? Well,

256
00:14:36.331 --> 00:14:41.190
that depends on whether it's in perfective or perfective for an imperfect verb

257
00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.640
like to touch the non past conjugation has present tense,

258
00:14:44.641 --> 00:14:46.560
meaning for a perfective verb,

259
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:50.400
like such it touch the non past conjugation has future tense.

260
00:14:50.401 --> 00:14:52.400
Meaning I'll not production.

261
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:56.590
This means she's reading a book while this sentence.

262
00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.870
<v 2>On that [inaudible] means.</v>

263
00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:02.110
<v 1>She will read a book. Unlike the past tense conjugations,</v>

264
00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:05.440
the non past conjugations don't have any gender distinctions.

265
00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:08.740
The tricky thing about the non past conjugation as that,

266
00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:09.910
there isn't just one of them.

267
00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:13.780
There are actually four different conjugations with virtually all verbs

268
00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:18.760
following one of them conjugation one and conjugation four are characterized

269
00:15:18.761 --> 00:15:20.890
by an evil in the third person,

270
00:15:20.891 --> 00:15:24.730
singular form conjugation to by an owl in the third person,

271
00:15:24.731 --> 00:15:28.780
singular form and conjugation three by an eight vowel in the third person,

272
00:15:28.781 --> 00:15:33.730
singular the perfective non past form is sometimes referred to

273
00:15:33.731 --> 00:15:34.990
as the simple future.

274
00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.100
There's another compound future tense that expresses the imperfection of future.

275
00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.130
In other words, an action that is ongoing or repeating in the.

276
00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:44.440
<v 2>Future on that Ben [inaudible].</v>

277
00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.940
<v 1>This sentence means she will be reading a book it's formed by using the future</v>

278
00:15:48.941 --> 00:15:53.770
tense of. The word meaning to be followed by the imperfection of infinitive.

279
00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:59.830
is an irregular verb using a different verb STEM in the past present and future

280
00:15:59.831 --> 00:16:02.320
forms. Here's an example in the present tense.

281
00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.720
This means I'm not Polish. And as a quick side note here,

282
00:16:07.721 --> 00:16:12.100
we see how Polish negation works. You simply place the negation particle. Yeah.

283
00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:16.750
Before the verb, now that we've examined some of the major features of Polish,

284
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:20.740
let's take a look at a few more sentences and see what we find this sentence

285
00:16:20.741 --> 00:16:23.140
means. My father reads two books every day.

286
00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:26.380
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

287
00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:31.270
<v 1>Word for word it's my father. Every day, read two books. First off,</v>

288
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:35.170
we see a possessive adjective before the noun, meaning father possessive,

289
00:16:35.171 --> 00:16:37.660
adjectives and Polish are inflected for the gender.

290
00:16:37.661 --> 00:16:41.140
And number of the now hear the word. All each its meaning.

291
00:16:41.141 --> 00:16:43.120
Father is masculine and singular.

292
00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.000
So the possessive is in its masculine singular form.

293
00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:50.200
And OIT jets is in the nominative case next.

294
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:54.880
So Jenya is an advert. Meaning every day, the word for day is genuine.

295
00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.670
Next. We see the third person masculine,

296
00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:02.260
singular present tense form of the verb. Next, we see the number Divya,

297
00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:03.880
which means two numbers.

298
00:17:03.881 --> 00:17:08.020
One to four in Polish have different forms depending on the case and gender of

299
00:17:08.021 --> 00:17:12.700
the noun they are referring to Divya is feminine and is used for nominative and

300
00:17:12.701 --> 00:17:15.370
accusative case here. It's the accusative.

301
00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:19.450
The number is feminine because the word for book is feminine. [inaudible]

302
00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:23.050
is the plural form used for nominative and accusative cases.

303
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:25.750
And here it's the accusative. A moment ago,

304
00:17:25.751 --> 00:17:29.200
I mentioned that numbers one to four have different numerous forms,

305
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:33.430
numbers higher than four have only two forms when counting masculine,

306
00:17:33.431 --> 00:17:34.264
personal nouns,

307
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:37.870
they are in the genitive case and the nouns they refer to are in the genitive

308
00:17:37.871 --> 00:17:40.090
case. And when counting all other nouns,

309
00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.130
they are in the nominative accusative case,

310
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.710
but the noun is still in the genitive case.

311
00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:48.460
So if we change the number in the sentence, say from two to five,

312
00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:52.080
the sentence look like this. My father reads five books every day.

313
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:59.810
<v 3>[Inaudible] the number five has two forms being true for masculine people and</v>

314
00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:01.453
binge for all.

315
00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:01.550
<v 1>Others,</v>

316
00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:06.470
including objects like books showing this now is in the genitive plural form.

317
00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:08.840
And one more sentence.

318
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:12.200
This sentence means everyone likes him because he often laughs

319
00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.060
[inaudible] Word for word it's everyone, him.

320
00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.990
They like because often reflexive pronoun laughs.

321
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:22.370
First we see the pronoun,

322
00:18:22.371 --> 00:18:25.790
meaning everyone pronouns in Polish have different case forms.

323
00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:29.270
Since this is the subject of the sentence. It's in the nominative case.

324
00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.220
Next we see a personal pronoun,

325
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:34.790
meaning him personal pronouns also have different case forms.

326
00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:38.540
This one is in the accusative case. There are two other accusative forms.

327
00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:41.570
<v 3>Yeah, go, yeah, go, go.</v>

328
00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.231
<v 1>Is used.</v>

329
00:18:42.231 --> 00:18:47.120
When the pronoun is not being emphasized is the third person plural

330
00:18:47.121 --> 00:18:49.040
form of the verb Lew beach,

331
00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:52.370
meaning to like this verb belongs to conjugation too.

332
00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:57.230
And has an I vowel in the third person singular next we see Bo a

333
00:18:57.231 --> 00:19:01.850
conjunction meaning because, and after that we see Johnston an adverb,

334
00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.670
meaning often next we see a reflexive verb,

335
00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.270
meaning he laughs Polish has lots of reflexive verbs,

336
00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:11.870
meaning that both the doer and the receiver of the action are the same.

337
00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:15.800
That may not always be obvious in terms of meaning, but in terms of grammar,

338
00:19:15.801 --> 00:19:19.910
that's how it works. This word share is a reflexive pronoun,

339
00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:24.260
which you simply add to the verb to form the reflexive. It has only one form.

340
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:28.490
Finally, something simple in Polish. The verb here is in the third person,

341
00:19:28.491 --> 00:19:32.120
singular present tense. And this for belongs to conjugation one.

342
00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.870
Let me take this part of the sentence and ask a question about it.

343
00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.140
Just to go to beyond meaning does everyone like him?

344
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:42.620
The way you ask yes or no questions in Polish is very simple.

345
00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:47.450
You simply add the question, marker. Let's formulate another question.

346
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.100
This means who do they like?

347
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.270
[inaudible] this is an open-ended question using an interrogative pronoun,

348
00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:57.290
meaning who interrogative pronouns in Polish have different case forms.

349
00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.650
This one is in the accusative case, in the nominative case,

350
00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:04.910
it takes a different form. So if you wanted to ask, who likes him, it would.

351
00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:06.350
<v 3>Be [inaudible].</v>

352
00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:10.490
<v 1>Is the nominative form honorable mention.</v>

353
00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.920
This is a last minute addition to the video,

354
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:16.760
but several Polish speakers have asked me to include this particular feature of

355
00:20:16.761 --> 00:20:20.090
the language. When talking about the presence of something in Polish,

356
00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.670
you use the verb, meaning to be.

357
00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.820
<v 3>For example, on two yest means he is here.</v>

358
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:29.540
<v 1>That seems straightforward. The unusual part is the negative form.</v>

359
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:35.750
Not it has him here. So this is like saying it doesn't have him here,

360
00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:40.790
but who is it? I don't know. But I suppose it's like a dummy subject in English.

361
00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:44.570
Like when we say it's sunny, it doesn't really refer to anything.

362
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.940
As you can see Polish an extremely interesting language,

363
00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:52.420
but it's also one that many learners find daunting and intimidating.

364
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.120
But as with any language, there are people who learn it,

365
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.780
whether they move to Poland or they're simply deeply interested in Polish

366
00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:02.740
culture, those people didn't learn everything about the language all at once.

367
00:21:02.741 --> 00:21:04.330
They learned certain pieces first,

368
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.930
then they learned other pieces afterwards until eventually they had a fuller

369
00:21:07.931 --> 00:21:11.890
picture of the language. So don't let the details of Polish scare you off.

370
00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.680
If you have the interest and the motivation to go for it.

371
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:17.890
The question of the day to native speakers of Polish,

372
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:22.060
what additional features of Polish would you like to tell us about, for example,

373
00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:26.140
are there any features of informal speech that you would like to share and to

374
00:21:26.141 --> 00:21:29.680
students of Polish? What do you find most challenging about the language?

375
00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:33.340
Do you have any tips on how to deal with it? If you enjoyed this video,

376
00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:36.640
then please check out the various Lang focus, social media accounts.

377
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.170
And of course, as always,

378
00:21:38.171 --> 00:21:41.410
I want to give a very special thanks to my Patrion supporters,

379
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.630
especially these ones right here on the screen,

380
00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.670
who are my top tier Patrion supporters.

381
00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.540
So I want to say a very special thanks to them for their support and to

382
00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:53.050
everyone. Thank you for watching and have a nice day.
