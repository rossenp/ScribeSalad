00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.970
<v 0>Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Lang focus channel.</v>

2
00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:13.880
And my name is Paul many European languages share a lot of features

3
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.600
that seem to be the norm or the default to speakers of those languages,

4
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.770
but are actually quite unusual amongst the thousands of languages of the world.

5
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.270
And many of those features can't be traced back to a common ancestor language or

6
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.230
prodo language. Rather it's believed that there is a European Shiprock.

7
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.070
Boone's an area in which various languages have influenced each other through

8
00:00:34.071 --> 00:00:36.380
geographic proximity and contact.

9
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.940
The Shiprock Puente is sometimes referred to as the European linguistic area.

10
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.900
And the set of shared linguistic features is referred to as standard average

11
00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:45.734
European.

12
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.580
Most of the languages of the standard average European struck Puente are

13
00:00:49.581 --> 00:00:50.990
Indo-European languages,

14
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.280
but since [inaudible] is a geographic area of contact and influence,

15
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.600
there are some non Indo-European languages that are also marginal members of it

16
00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:01.910
as well, including Finnish and Hungarian.

17
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.380
Most features of standard average European are not from prodo Indo-European,

18
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.910
but are later innovations,

19
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.260
which then spread to other European languages features that are clearly part of

20
00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:13.130
standard. Average,

21
00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:17.750
European are found in a core of European languages are not found in the Armenian

22
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.580
Iranian or Indic branches of Indo-European and are not found in the majority of

23
00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:23.570
the world's languages,

24
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.170
Sprocket boons affect different languages to different degrees.

25
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.250
So there are some core languages that exhibit most of the features of standard

26
00:01:31.251 --> 00:01:34.040
average European, and there are others that exhibit fewer,

27
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.360
this map shows nine characteristic features of standard average European,

28
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.590
and the number of features exhibited by different languages at the core live

29
00:01:42.591 --> 00:01:46.760
French and German, which exhibit all nine features Dutch Spanish,

30
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.690
Portuguese Sardinian, Italian and Albanian each exhibit eight,

31
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.490
English Romanian and Greek exhibit seven, the North Germanic languages,

32
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.420
as well as check exhibit six, Latvian Lithuanian,

33
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.310
Russian Ukrainian, Polish, Hungarian, Bulgarian, Slovenian, Serbian,

34
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.240
and Croatian,

35
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.220
all exhibit five features languages with fewer than five features are not really

36
00:02:10.221 --> 00:02:12.350
considered part of standard average European.

37
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.720
Even though there may be some peripheral influence.

38
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.140
Now let's take a look at those nine features. Number one,

39
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.100
having both definite and indefinite articles like the, and ah,

40
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.480
in English only about one third of the world's languages have articles and the

41
00:02:26.481 --> 00:02:30.590
number of languages with both definite and indefinite articles is much smaller.

42
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.420
So it's remarkable that in Europe,

43
00:02:32.421 --> 00:02:36.670
so many languages have both and that's evidence of the standard average European

44
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.250
[inaudible]

45
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.250
, which languages have. These features, all the romance languages, all Germanic languages, except for Icelandic, which is the most geographically peripheral Germanic language, some bulk in languages, including modern Greek and 

46
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.250
maybe

47
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.250
 Albanian and Bulgarian, which don't have it Baltic and Slavic languages possibly aside from Bulgarian here, we can see the German definite indefinite articles in all of their inflected 

48
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.250
forums

49
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.250
. Here. We can see the French definite and indefinite articles. And here we see the Hungarian definite and indefinite articles. Number two, relative clauses with relative pronouns. These are relative clauses that come after the 

50
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.250
note

51
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.250
 with a relative pronoun that changes depending on the function of the head of the sentence, for instance, in English, the man who drives the car versus the 

52
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.250
man whose car I drove in German in German, the relative pronoun

53
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.083
 comes from a demonstrative pronoun, but in most cases, the relative pronoun comes from an interrogative pronoun. In other words, a question word like.

54
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.350
<v 1>[Inaudible] and in modern Greek.</v>

55
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.530
<v 0>As you can see from the map, this feature is widespread.</v>

56
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.060
Even outside of the core standard average European languages. Number three,

57
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.960
the have perfect. Like I have finished the report in English.

58
00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.640
This is a paraphrase stick,

59
00:03:59.641 --> 00:04:03.030
perfect tense using the verb have plus a past participle,

60
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.270
such a construction exists in all romance languages,

61
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.240
all Germanic languages and some bulk in languages,

62
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.560
including modern Greek Albanian and Macedonian. In some of these languages,

63
00:04:13.561 --> 00:04:16.260
it has a simple past meaning. And in other languages,

64
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.710
it has a present perfect meaning. Here's an example in German

65
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.273
and in French.

66
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.320
<v 1>And in modern Greek [inaudible].</v>

67
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.420
<v 0>Number four, a passive formed within and transitive linking verb.</v>

68
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.350
Plus a past participle. For example, in English, the car was stolen.

69
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.480
This kind of passive is used in all romance, Germanic and Slavic languages,

70
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.320
other languages of the Balkans, as well as to Celtic languages,

71
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.740
Irish and Breton among others in German

72
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:52.763
and in French.

73
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.140
<v 1>[Inaudible] in Polish [inaudible] and in Britain</v>

74
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.510
[inaudible].

75
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.900
<v 0>This type of passive is rare outside of standard average European,</v>

76
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.040
but it should be noted that it does appear in Iranian and Indic languages.

77
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.880
So maybe it's an Indo-European feature rather than just a standard average

78
00:05:11.881 --> 00:05:16.770
European Shiprock wound feature. Number five dates of external possessors.

79
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.060
These occur when the possessor and the thing that's possessed appear in separate

80
00:05:21.061 --> 00:05:25.680
noun phrases with the possessor being in the date of case or an indirect object.

81
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.320
For example, in German de-motivation

82
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.790
meaning the mother is washing the child's hair,

83
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.080
but word for word it's the mother washes the child date of case,

84
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.410
the hair accusative case, and then example in Spanish,

85
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.710
meaning I haven't seen his face,

86
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.840
but word for word it's no him indirect object have seen the face

87
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.630
number six negative pronouns with no verbal negation. For example, in English,

88
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.430
nobody came notice that the verb is not negated.

89
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.350
This type of negation occurs in all Germanic languages, French oxytocin,

90
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.400
Ibero romance,

91
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:08.870
and to tell a romance languages as well as Albanian one romance language that

92
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:13.040
doesn't appear in his Romanian. It's also absent from Slavic languages,

93
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.170
urologic languages and others in German. And in.

94
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.390
<v 1>French, if we.</v>

95
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:25.010
<v 0>Ignore the main negation word, pot is not here to negate the verb.</v>

96
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.930
And these days people often skip the nut anyway, in Spanish and Italian,

97
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:31.430
this type of negation is used,

98
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.610
but if the negative pronoun is an object after the verb,

99
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.020
as opposed to the subject, then the verb is negated. For example, in Spanish

100
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.760
seven comparisons of equality,

101
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.120
based on an adverbial relative clause in English,

102
00:06:47.121 --> 00:06:51.110
we have comparisons like as tall as me in German, this would be.

103
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.820
<v 1>[Inaudible] V E V.</v>

104
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.220
<v 0>Being a relative adverb. In other words,</v>

105
00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.700
it's used to introduce a relative clause like in this sentence,

106
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:07.390
meaning I like how you think in English as is not used to introduce

107
00:07:07.391 --> 00:07:12.340
relative clauses like that, but it derives from L swab or also,

108
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:17.290
which was used as a relative pronoun in the past. And in modern Greek.

109
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.630
<v 1>Does subsea LA or psycho.</v>

110
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.820
<v 0>This feature appears in the romance languages, West Germanic languages,</v>

111
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.480
Slavic languages, Hungarian, Albanian, and modern Greek.

112
00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.830
It's not found in North dramatic languages finish the Celtic languages.

113
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.020
And so on number eight,

114
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.850
non-pro drop perhaps a more precise term for this is strict subject

115
00:07:39.851 --> 00:07:41.770
agreement in most languages.

116
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:46.330
Verbs usually have ethics as that indicate the subject and very commonly the

117
00:07:46.331 --> 00:07:51.010
explicit subject pronouns can be dropped for example, in Arabic [inaudible]

118
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:51.010
, which means I love you when spoken to a female, we know from the prefix, ah

119
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:51.010
, that this is first person singular. So the subject Ana meaning I

120
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:51.010
 is often left out, but in certain European languages, including the core standard average European languages 

121
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:51.010
of

122
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:51.010
 French and German, as well as Dutch, English, Welsh and Icelandic, the subject pronouns 

123
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:51.010
cannot

124
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:51.843
 be dropped. Even though there are affixes that agree with the subject. For example, in German, the subject pronoun here is necessary and can't be dropped.

125
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:26.260
This is one feature that only applies to a limited number of standard average

126
00:08:26.261 --> 00:08:30.730
European languages in Spanish. For example, [inaudible] means I love you.

127
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:34.660
Spanish is pro drop. The subject pronoun here can be left out.

128
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.210
But as a side note in Spain,

129
00:08:37.211 --> 00:08:41.770
it would be more common to express love by saying guilty or ghetto,

130
00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.030
meaning I want you,

131
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.320
but in friendships French's non-pro drop.

132
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.710
So the subject pronoun is required even though syntactically,

133
00:08:50.711 --> 00:08:53.020
it completely lines up with the Spanish sentence.

134
00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.120
If the pronoun is included in the Spanish

135
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:01.170
number nine intensifier reflexive distinction in English,

136
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.890
we use the word self and its derivatives myself himself.

137
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.010
And so on as an intensifier, for example,

138
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:12.000
the president himself gave a speech at our school in the sentence.

139
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:14.100
The word himself is an intensifier.

140
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:18.000
It emphasizes that it's the president and not someone else who gave a speech at

141
00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:20.760
the school, but in English and in many languages,

142
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:25.560
such intensifiers are also used as reflexive pronouns as well. For example,

143
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:26.670
he loves himself,

144
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:31.500
but a typical feature of standard average European languages is that different

145
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:35.340
words are used for the intensifier and for the reflexive in German,

146
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.690
meaning the president himself and

147
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.340
meaning he loves himself and in Polish.

148
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.390
<v 1>I'm president. And [inaudible].</v>

149
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:50.450
<v 0>Again, we have the intensifier and the reflexive pronoun,</v>

150
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:52.820
which are different in French.

151
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.850
<v 1>I don't remember. And [inaudible].</v>

152
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:59.450
<v 0>This is the direct translation of, he loves himself in French,</v>

153
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.360
but this isn't really a natural sentence for that meaning.

154
00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:05.030
So another example with a reflexive pronoun.

155
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.310
<v 1>Is meaning.</v>

156
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.990
<v 0>He sees himself in the mirror.</v>

157
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:13.310
Obviously this differentiation does not occur in English or in Dutch either,

158
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.460
but it occurs in many standard average European languages,

159
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:20.390
including those which tend to have fewer Sprocket bone features like the North

160
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.230
dramatic languages, Latvian and Lithuanian, and the Slavic languages,

161
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:28.910
even Basque Basque is a language isolate and not considered a standard average

162
00:10:28.911 --> 00:10:32.540
European language because it doesn't share enough of the [inaudible] features,

163
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.160
but it does share a couple of them.

164
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:38.630
This is a good example of how [inaudible] can have varying degrees of impact on

165
00:10:38.631 --> 00:10:41.510
different languages, depending on geography and contact.

166
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:46.280
Those nine features are considered highly likely to be part of a European

167
00:10:46.281 --> 00:10:47.114
Shiprock Puente.

168
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.390
There are numerous other features which may be part of the Sprott Puente as

169
00:10:50.391 --> 00:10:54.650
well, but are less certain one such feature is SVO word order.

170
00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.820
S V O for example, in English, I love languages.

171
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.040
S V O and in German

172
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:06.170
S V O S VO is not limited to Europe,

173
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.220
but within Europe it seems to correspond well with the other core standard

174
00:11:10.221 --> 00:11:11.540
average European features.

175
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.790
There's also an absence of certain features that are common in other regions of

176
00:11:16.791 --> 00:11:19.800
the world. One example is the absence of reduplicate.

177
00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.870
Reduplicate is the repetition of a word or part of a word,

178
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:27.560
usually to change something about its meaning or function. For example,

179
00:11:27.561 --> 00:11:30.620
in Indonesia, there's the word honor, which means child.

180
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.740
And that is the plural form. Meaning children,

181
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:38.510
this type of reduplicate is almost totally absent from standard average European

182
00:11:38.511 --> 00:11:41.180
languages. How did the Sprocket Boont arise?

183
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.380
It's hard to know exactly what historical events or conditions contributed to

184
00:11:45.381 --> 00:11:49.070
the spread of standard average European features. But according to Martin,

185
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:49.760
[inaudible], who's

186
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.593
 the source of most of the information in this video, the most likely hypothesis is that it happened during the migration period between roughly 300 and 700 CE during the transition from late antiquity to the early middle ages.

187
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.120
During this time, the Western Roman empire declined then collapsed,

188
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.420
which triggered widespread invasions into and within Europe,

189
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.150
particularly into the territory of the empire,

190
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:17.500
the resulting migrations must've brought many languages into contact with each

191
00:12:17.501 --> 00:12:21.850
other. Of course, this may be responsible for some of the Spock wound features.

192
00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.600
While other features may have spread as a result of different historical events.

193
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.810
One of the most fascinating things about languages as that,

194
00:12:28.811 --> 00:12:32.440
they are a result of everything that has happened to their speakers and their

195
00:12:32.441 --> 00:12:34.300
ancestors. Up until this point.

196
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.960
The question of the day is the rush Brock Puente in your region,

197
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.460
or is there another Spock, boom,

198
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.160
you've heard about what kind of shared features are there,

199
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.700
