00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.800
<v 0>Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Lang focus channel. And my name is Paul. Today.</v>

2
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:07.920
We're going to look at a wild way of studying congee.

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.780
If you don't know what congee are,

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.890
they are idiographic characters that are used to write words or parts of words

5
00:00:13.891 --> 00:00:16.680
in Japanese. They are originally Chinese,

6
00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:18.930
but we're adopted into Japanese as well.

7
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.540
You don't read a Kanji like an alphabet letter,

8
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.650
but you look at it as a symbol or a series of symbols that represent a meaning.

9
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.900
And if you know the word that matches that meaning,

10
00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:30.660
then you can pronounce the Kanji when you read it. Of course,

11
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:33.060
there's a bit more to it than that, but that's the gist of it.

12
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.330
But since they are audio graphs and not pictures, Kanji,

13
00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:40.260
usually don't contain visually concrete images. Check out this one,

14
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.320
meaning apologize. How does that mean apologize?

15
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.480
They can be visually complex,

16
00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:49.710
containing many different parts and basic adult literacy in Japanese requires

17
00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:54.420
knowledge of around 2000 Kanji and literacy. And Chinese requires many more.

18
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.380
How can you remember how to read and write thousands of visually complex

19
00:00:58.381 --> 00:01:02.940
characters like this children in Japan drill them like crazy from kindergarten

20
00:01:02.941 --> 00:01:06.420
through high school using simple brute force rote memorization.

21
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.320
But what if you're a guy Jean who doesn't want to spend 12 years learning how to

22
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:11.154
read Kanji?

23
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.940
There are some strategies we can use to gain a working knowledge of Kanji in a

24
00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:16.260
much shorter amount of time.

25
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.790
One method was created by James w HighSeq and presented in his book,

26
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.610
remembering the congee. Let me start with an example.

27
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.300
This Kanji means elder brother. In other words, older brother,

28
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.590
it has two components, this peace, which means mouth on its own.

29
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.040
And these two strokes, which kind of look like human legs.

30
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.790
This gives us an image of a main older brother who never shuts up.

31
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.050
He's just a big mouth walking around on two legs saying annoying, mean things.

32
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.700
Since most Kanji consist of various shapes arranged in different ways.

33
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.490
HighSeq assigns a keyword to each of those shapes,

34
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.640
and you can use those keywords to create a mnemonic story,

35
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.260
a story or image that helps you remember the meaning of that Kanji Hiza refers

36
00:01:58.261 --> 00:02:01.170
to these shapes or congee components as primitives,

37
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.060
as we can see in this example,

38
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.440
some primitives are standalone Kanji on their own, like this one, meaning mouth,

39
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.430
while others do not appear on their own only as a component of a larger Kanji

40
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.110
like this one for human legs.

41
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.730
Another such primitive that only appears in other Kanji is this one Hiza gives

42
00:02:17.731 --> 00:02:21.510
this primitive, the keyword devil. You can see that it contains the character,

43
00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:22.560
meaning older brother.

44
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.620
When this character appears as a primitive in another congee,

45
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.970
we can modify its meaning slightly to teenager to give us access to a wider

46
00:02:29.971 --> 00:02:31.530
range of images and stories.

47
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.800
So this is an image of a teenager with two horns on his head.

48
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.160
There are plenty of adults who think that teenagers are the devil.

49
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.770
They look at them and imagine devil horns on their head.

50
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.830
I guess that's because of teenagers evil behavior.

51
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.750
<v 1>Oh my gosh. Why are these teenagers standing in front of seven 11?</v>

52
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.290
<v 0>This Kanji means undress.</v>

53
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.910
It contains the primitive meaning devil or evil teenager and another piece,

54
00:02:55.911 --> 00:03:00.850
which means moon on its own. But you know what to is also a transitive verb,

55
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.290
meaning to show your bare butt to someone as a prank. So as a primitive, I mean,

56
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:06.550
as part of another congee,

57
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.940
this component can take on the meaning of flesh or body part.

58
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.930
Those are the keywords chosen by HighSeq, but I think bare butt works too.

59
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.850
So we know that this Kanji clearly means undressed because it shows an evil

60
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:23.440
teenager possessed by the devil stripping down to his bare butt or her bare

61
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.190
butts or insert your pronoun here bare. But by the way,

62
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.080
just like bear butt evil teenager is my idea and not the exact keyword given by

63
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.970
HighSeq. When I used this method,

64
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.390
I changed some of the keywords in the book to ones that were more memorable to

65
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:40.720
me. He recommends you don't do that, but well, I did it.

66
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.560
You just have to make sure your personally chosen keywords aren't used for other

67
00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:48.220
Kanji or primitives. This congee means pointed as in sharp,

68
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.390
it contains the primitive meaning devil or evil teenager. Same thing,

69
00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:54.880
really this one on the left, meaning metal,

70
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.550
which also appears on its own meaning gold.

71
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.960
The word pointed refers to those sharp metal objects that evil teenagers

72
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:05.740
possessed by the devil carry in their pockets so they can Rob all the innocent

73
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:07.450
adults or even worse.

74
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.730
<v 1>Why.</v>

75
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.760
<v 0>Are some of these Kanji stories so insane or ridiculous?</v>

76
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.840
Look at what I wrote on the inside cover of my copy of remembering the Kanji,

77
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.300
do not read these stories without my permission.

78
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.350
Many are intentionally disturbing to aid memorization. And yes,

79
00:04:23.351 --> 00:04:25.120
I realized that my handwriting here,

80
00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:27.970
it might be just as disturbing the stories for these cans.

81
00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:30.250
You don't always have to be insane or shocking.

82
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.900
You just need to imagine a vivid, memorable image. This Kanji means storm.

83
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.620
The bottom component means wind. And the top one means mountain.

84
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.460
Both of these exist as independent Kanji as well for this Kanji,

85
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.990
I imagine a storm so powerful that the wind tears a mountain out of the ground

86
00:04:46.991 --> 00:04:51.040
and sends it flying into the air. That's why the mountain is on top of the wind.

87
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.610
See, as long as you come up with a vivid image, it doesn't have to be sure.

88
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.493
<v 1>Okay.</v>

89
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.110
<v 0>Right here as a congee, meaning large.</v>

90
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.100
But when it appears as a primitive and other congee high Zig recommends using

91
00:05:08.101 --> 00:05:12.300
the keyword St. Bernard, a kind of dog, but that's kind of lamb,

92
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.970
how's this for an alternative Godzilla.

93
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.420
How can you not come up with a memorable image using Godzilla?

94
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.260
But I suppose you could use another large beast like King Kong or something.

95
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.420
This congee means stinking.

96
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.740
The bottom components is Godzilla and the top component means nose,

97
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.500
which also appears on its own with its own story.

98
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.580
Imagine Godzilla roaming around your city with his nose in the air,

99
00:05:35.581 --> 00:05:39.030
sniffing for the smell of humans to eat people with stinking,

100
00:05:39.031 --> 00:05:43.020
body odor are the ones he'll find first and tear them limb from limb with a

101
00:05:43.021 --> 00:05:43.854
sharp

102
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.710
Kanji means person. But when it appears as a primitive and other Kanji,

103
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.090
you can choose a specific person. Who's very memorable to you.

104
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.610
When I did the remembering the Kanji course,

105
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.330
I used a childhood friend of mine who was always getting into trouble because I

106
00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:06.650
had lots of stories about him.

107
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.050
But since you're watching and you don't know my friends,

108
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.950
let me choose a new memorable person right now. How about Arnold?

109
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:16.220
Schwartzenegger this Kanji means rest.

110
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.700
When the person primitive appears on the left side of a congee,

111
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.990
its shape is slightly modified. Like it's been squeezed into a narrower space.

112
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.420
This primitive on the right means tree,

113
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.170
and also appears on its own as an independent Kanji, you might be thinking,

114
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.370
okay, Arnold Schwartzenegger is sitting under a tree resting. Yeah, that's fine.

115
00:06:34.371 --> 00:06:35.450
But that's kind of the lamb.

116
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.440
Arnold Schwartzenegger has been pulling trees right out of the ground and

117
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.470
chopping them up into wood with his bare hands all day.

118
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.640
So now he needs to rest after resting for a solid 30 seconds.

119
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.020
Arnie stands up again and starts uprooting more trees feeling well rested.

120
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.130
This Kanji means dwell as in, to live in a place.

121
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.270
This component on the right takes on the visual keyword of Kendall stick.

122
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.640
When it's a primitive as a Kanji on its own,

123
00:07:01.641 --> 00:07:05.750
it means Lord and has its own story. Back when he dwelled in Austria,

124
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.560
Arnold Schwartzenegger was very poor and dwelled in a little shack with no

125
00:07:09.561 --> 00:07:10.394
electricity.

126
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.260
Instead he set a three meter tall Kendall stick inside the shack so that he

127
00:07:15.261 --> 00:07:18.560
could dwell on himself in the mirror, even after dark note,

128
00:07:18.561 --> 00:07:20.990
that dwell on has the meaning of focus on.

129
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.270
So this is different from the meaning of the congee,

130
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.810
but it's a play on words that can reinforce my memory of the keyword.

131
00:07:26.811 --> 00:07:31.640
Even more Isaac's zigs keyword for this primitive is Sao meaning an adult

132
00:07:31.641 --> 00:07:32.474
female pig,

133
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.830
but I added a second option piglet that is piglet from the Winnie the Pooh

134
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:40.100
series. It's fine to use both since they're closely related,

135
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.520
but piglet might provide a more vivid image for certain Kanji.

136
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:48.440
This Kanji means pursue. It contains two primitives sow and road.

137
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:53.390
Imagine a swarm of 50 sours escaping from their farm and running down the road

138
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.690
with a desperate farmer, pursuing them, trying to get them back.

139
00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:00.590
This congee means drama. As in theater performance,

140
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.880
it contains three primitives tiger piglet and saber,

141
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.750
but I'm going to modify tiger to Tigger, to fit in with piglet.

142
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.110
And while Sabre as in sword is a decent keyword.

143
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:13.940
I'm going to make it lightsaber.

144
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:22.030
This drama, this dramatic play, the climax consists of Tigger and piglet.

145
00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:26.890
Having a duel with lightsabers, it's supposed to be a mirror drama, just acting,

146
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.850
but Tigger accidentally kills piglet vivid images are great.

147
00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:34.480
And some of the most vivid images for you might be memories of things you've

148
00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:39.400
experienced. This Kanji means window. It contains four primitives house,

149
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.000
human legs, elbow, and heart for this Kanji.

150
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:46.420
I remember the time I came home after I'd forgotten my house key.

151
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:50.290
So I had to get inside by climbing through a tiny window into the kitchen,

152
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.180
which we left open for our cat.

153
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.480
I imagined the image of my body half inside house with my human legs hanging

154
00:08:57.481 --> 00:09:01.500
outside. After finally squeezing through and landing on the kitchen floor.

155
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.250
I had a sore elbow and my heart was racing from all the adrenaline.

156
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:08.790
This really happened to me actually four or five different times.

157
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:10.080
So it's hard for me to forget

158
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.470
Memorizing so many Kanji.

159
00:09:18.471 --> 00:09:22.400
Using simple rote memorization would be really hard or at least take a long

160
00:09:22.401 --> 00:09:24.050
time, but using mnemonics,

161
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.220
using your imagination and associations to help you remember is an extremely

162
00:09:28.221 --> 00:09:29.630
useful tool in your arsenal.

163
00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.500
It's also a heck of a lot more interesting than just drilling the same Kanji a

164
00:09:33.501 --> 00:09:37.310
million times in order to remember it. So if you're learning Japanese Kanji,

165
00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.270
have a look at high zigs, remembering the Kanji and give it a try. Of course,

166
00:09:41.271 --> 00:09:44.900
it requires a lot of dedication to come up with stories for 2000 different

167
00:09:44.901 --> 00:09:48.080
Kanji. And you do have to review them in order to reinforce them,

168
00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.830
but people who complete the program and do their reviews, rarely regret it.

169
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:56.000
There's also a version for Chinese as well, which comes in two versions,

170
00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.490
simplified Chinese and traditional Chinese.

171
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.040
But even if you don't use this specific method,

172
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:05.690
the general idea of using your imagination and creativity as a memory tool is

173
00:10:05.691 --> 00:10:07.820
something that we can learn from it. Oh,

174
00:10:07.821 --> 00:10:12.290
and I must apologize for forgetting to explain this Kanji, meaning apologize.

175
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:17.120
This one contains two primitives words and shoot each of which have their own

176
00:10:17.121 --> 00:10:19.370
stories and can be broken down. Even further.

177
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.140
This Kanji represents an abusive husband. Every time he hurts his wife,

178
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.960
he comes back to her and apologizes profusely.

179
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.240
But this time when she hears his words,

180
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:36.170
The question of the day to people who have used the remembering the Kanji course

181
00:10:36.171 --> 00:10:38.300
to learn Kanji, what was your experience with it?

182
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.840
Did it help you remember the meanings of Kanji and to other people?

183
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.890
Do you use any kinds of memory techniques that help you learn characters, words,

184
00:10:45.891 --> 00:10:49.130
or other parts of a language? Let us know in the comments down below,
