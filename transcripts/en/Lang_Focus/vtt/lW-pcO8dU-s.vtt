00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.850
Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Lang focus channel.

6
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.900
And my name is Paul in the recent video on the Swedish language,

7
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.070
we focused on the history of Swedish as well as some of its major features,

8
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.780
but Swedish is also an incredibly expressive language with colorful slang,

9
00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:31.770
expressions and idioms. Today, we're going to focus on some common slang,

10
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.010
and then we're going to look at some widely used idioms,

11
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.950
but Shung meaning bro, or brother.

12
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.360
The main word for brother is [inaudible] from which this is obviously derived.

13
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.920
Ahem, that what's happening. Another common expression is by dose.

14
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.450
Meaning what's up. Well,

15
00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:52.140
it literally means what is being done by [inaudible]

16
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.140
. This is like what's happening, bro. About Sheila

17
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.973
. I'm just chilling. This comes from the American English slang, chill out or.

18
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.620
<v 1>Chill [inaudible] I do footfall on the bark is,</v>

19
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.760
are you still hung over? Barcus is short for Bach full,

20
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.060
which means hung over your joy.

21
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:13.190
[inaudible].

22
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.530
<v 0>Yeah, I saw you pass out on the sofa last night.</v>

23
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.570
The formal meaning of that is literally DEC both in the sense of a

24
00:01:20.571 --> 00:01:24.050
floor and the sense of decking, someone in other words, hitting them.

25
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.720
But in this slime usage, it's an intransitive verb.

26
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.890
Like you decked on the sofa with the meaning of you passed out.

27
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.770
This guy should consider drinking a little bit less.

28
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.740
Spesh the formal word for beer and Swedish is a cognitive,

29
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.800
the English word ale, but there's also a slang word Besh.

30
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.120
It came from the phrase biased, meaning Bavarian beer,

31
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.980
which turned into bias. And then it was further shortened to Besh.

32
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.420
This may not be classified as genuine slang since it's been in use for a long

33
00:01:56.421 --> 00:01:58.880
time, but it's at least distinctly informal.

34
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.860
There's also another informal word for beer, which originally came from Italian.

35
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.690
[inaudible] bad in Swedish, but all means good.

36
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.290
And OU is a negation prefix like an in English.

37
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.150
So it's like saying and good in English, which is not an official English word,

38
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.030
but you could use it in a slimy way and it would work.

39
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.770
The Swedish word is kind of like that.

40
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.150
The formal way of saying bad is though I lit or Interborough,

41
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.070
which means not good. Who does he know? How has your beer guns got?

42
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.780
[inaudible] pretty bad. A similar word is cool. Uncool.

43
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.680
The formal way of saying it is in the Cooley. Meaning not cool.

44
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.880
This prefix can be added freely to lots of different adjectives to create a new

45
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.530
slimy word Lang focus.

46
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.660
<v 1>Ooh, cool. [inaudible] cool. Letter.</v>

47
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.420
<v 0>Lang focuses on cool Pewdie pie as cooler.</v>

48
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:53.683
You ain't sweetie.

49
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.540
<v 2>If you don't have committed, bro, that's just a fact.</v>

50
00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.100
<v 0>Another word that can be used to mean cool fact,</v>

51
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.580
which literally means fat informal Swedish, the unfit.

52
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.230
That's a cool car.

53
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.090
Another common slang word is this one that means angry luck.

54
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.460
I'm luck. He got angry.

55
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.290
<v 1>Um, like for yourself, I'm a fields. Mimi. I'm not cool.</v>

56
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.290
<v 0>He got angry because I said he was fat, but I meant he was.</v>

57
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.190
<v 1>Cool. I'm dumb luck for certain fields may or not cool</v>

58
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.650
bucks to steal

59
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.030
[inaudible].

60
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.050
<v 0>The rich guy got angry because someone stole his champagne. Steve. It,</v>

61
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.550
this literally means griller as in someone who grilled steak, but in slang,

62
00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:42.360
it refers to a snobby rich guy who likes to flaunt his wealth in the bars of

63
00:03:42.361 --> 00:03:46.260
Stockholm. These guys are famous for at Vasca panning,

64
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.870
as in panning for gold in slang,

65
00:03:48.871 --> 00:03:52.710
it means ordering two bottles of champagne and dumping out the contents of one

66
00:03:52.711 --> 00:03:54.660
of them just to show off how rich they are.

67
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.290
The good news is that people who do stupid, things like that with their money,

68
00:03:58.291 --> 00:04:02.250
usually don't stay rich for very long. In recent decades.

69
00:04:02.251 --> 00:04:06.420
Some slang has also entered Swedish from immigrant languages in particular

70
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.940
Turkish, but also Arabic. And some others.

71
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.240
This slang is more widely used in immigrant communities,

72
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.690
but it's also used to a lesser extent by young people in general,

73
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.840
one such word is Kith, meaning bad.

74
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.630
The tea at the end here indicates the neuter form.

75
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.760
This comes from the Arabic word cave or Kaif meaning pleasure or fun.

76
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.420
The meaning became reversed from positive to negative and Swedish.

77
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.310
They kept that's bad.

78
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.730
<v 1>They add a gift part.</v>

79
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.940
<v 0>Of this means money. And this is a lone word from Turkish INO.</v>

80
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.480
This means police. This comes from Turkish highnesses,

81
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.430
which means without mirror an expression used in Turkish to refer to police in a

82
00:04:47.431 --> 00:04:48.264
negative way,

83
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.570
meaning that they're shameless and can't look at themselves in the mirror.

84
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.420
The funny thing is that in Swedish, they just say, I know.

85
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.530
So they're referring to police as mirrors rather than as people who can't look

86
00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:01.560
in the mirror, Swedish speakers, don't only use slang.

87
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.840
They also use lots of colorful idioms.

88
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.670
Some of which seem truly bizarre in translation in [inaudible] its

89
00:05:08.671 --> 00:05:13.230
literal translation is no danger on the roof. It means no worries.

90
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.970
Or there's nothing to worry about.

91
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.170
Another idiom with a similar meaning is being in cool. Put your sun,

92
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.640
which literally means no cow on the ice. This is taken from a longer idiom.

93
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.280
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

94
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.980
<v 0>Which literally means there is no cow on the ice.</v>

95
00:05:28.981 --> 00:05:31.200
As long as the button is still on land.

96
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.970
<v 1>[Inaudible]. But.</v>

97
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.790
<v 0>Literally now you have taken a in the blue cabin.</v>

98
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.900
You say this to someone who has really messed up and created a problematic

99
00:05:42.901 --> 00:05:43.734
situation.

100
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:47.670
<v 1>[Inaudible] literally.</v>

101
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.620
<v 0>Slide in on a shrimp sandwich.</v>

102
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.370
You say this when you were lucky and something turned out to not require much

103
00:05:53.371 --> 00:05:58.190
effort or work on the other hand, when you gave your best shot,

104
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.340
but you were unsuccessful and it didn't turn out. As you expected,

105
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.060
you might say no to cool stuff. Let's get sticked. Literally.

106
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.870
Now the boiled pork is fried. Some Swedish,

107
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.030
idioms are similar to ones used in English.

108
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.650
So [inaudible], this literally means the way you make your bed. You have to lie 

109
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.650
in it in

110
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.650
 English. We have a similar idiom. You've made your bed now lie in it. And there are numerous variations of the city 

111
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.650
of an

112
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.650
 English. Basically it means you'll have to live with the consequences of your own actions. 

113
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:13.483
[inaudible]

114
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.270
this means butterflies in the stomach,

115
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.790
meaning something like an anxious feeling.

116
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.160
They let some implants. Literally that's easy as a pancake.

117
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.890
And it simply means that's really easy in English.

118
00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:47.540
We have a number of expressions like this. One of them is easy as pie though.

119
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.080
That's a pretty outdated expression and no one really uses it anymore.

120
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.180
Maybe that's something my grandmother would say,

121
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.570
but another similar expression might be it's a cakewalk,

122
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.540
both expressions mean that something's really easy to do.

123
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.830
[inaudible] by the peg in the bag.

124
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.640
This is similar to the English idiom by a pig in a poke poke,

125
00:07:07.641 --> 00:07:10.430
meaning sack or bag in both languages.

126
00:07:10.431 --> 00:07:14.630
It means to buy something without examining the item first so that it might not

127
00:07:14.631 --> 00:07:19.070
be exactly what you expect it to be. It might be fake low quality or broken,

128
00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:19.904
et cetera.

129
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.380
I'm sure I'm just barely scratching the surface of Swedish slang and idioms.

130
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.770
But the great thing about social media is that you can participate in the

131
00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:29.630
comments. So Swedish speakers,

132
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.380
why don't you write your favorite slang and idioms in the comments down below

133
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.060
and speakers of other languages.

134
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.150
