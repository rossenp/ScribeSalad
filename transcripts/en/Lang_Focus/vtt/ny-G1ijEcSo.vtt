00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.410
<v 0>Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Lang focus channel. And the,</v>

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.400
my name is Paul students all over the English speaking world studies Shakespeare

3
00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:10.650
at school, and lots of them hate it,

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.550
maybe because what the reading feels a little bit like a different language and

5
00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:16.080
they can't understand it very well.

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.070
The reason the plays and poems of William Shakespeare aren't immediately easy to

7
00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:24.030
understand is that they were written in early modern English between the years,

8
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:25.530
1590 and 16,

9
00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:30.240
13 Shakespeare wrote at least 38 plays and over 150 poems,

10
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:34.770
both short and long. Some of these are legendary classics like Hamlet, Macbeth,

11
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.090
and Romeo and Juliet.

12
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.560
The works of William Shakespeare made a tremendous impact on Western culture.

13
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.000
And more importantly for us here today on the English language, of course,

14
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:49.320
there are famous lines from Shakespeare's plays like to be or not to be.

15
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.500
That is the question, but that's not what I'm talking about.

16
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.670
I'm talking about an extensive impact on the actual vocabulary of English,

17
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.050
including many words that we use every day and many idiomatic expressions that

18
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:02.220
are frequently used.

19
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.140
It has commonly been said that Shakespeare created 1,700 words that are

20
00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:08.970
commonly used in modern English.

21
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.270
We have to be careful with that number and the word created though,

22
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.690
there are many words whose first appearance in writing is in the works of

23
00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:16.650
William Shakespeare.

24
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.310
But many of these words may have been in colloquial use at the time while

25
00:01:20.311 --> 00:01:22.740
Shakespeare was just the first to use them in writing.

26
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.850
And some of these 1,700 words actually appeared in earlier,

27
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:28.230
but less known literature.

28
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.160
It might be better to say that Shakespeare popularized these words and helped

29
00:01:32.161 --> 00:01:34.890
ensure their presence in modern English, as it developed.

30
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.430
It's hard to know exactly which words he created himself and which ones he

31
00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:42.540
didn't let's start with idioms because we have a better idea of which ones

32
00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:45.510
originated with Shakespeare, too much of a good thing.

33
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.480
This idiom first appeared in the play. As you like it,

34
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.860
you might be a little surprised by what thing refers to in the original context

35
00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:54.360
of the play. It's um,

36
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.550
I guess you could say it's meaning as somewhat adult the be all and end

37
00:01:59.551 --> 00:02:03.450
all meaning the most impressive or important in its category.

38
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.370
This city I'm first appeared in the play.

39
00:02:05.371 --> 00:02:08.520
Macbeth Shakespeare used it with a somewhat different meaning.

40
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.220
All that is needed to end all this problems.

41
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.490
Macbeth is considering assassinating King Dunkin,

42
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.840
but wonders about the additional problems that will cause come full circle.

43
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.020
This first appeared in King Lear to come full circle.

44
00:02:22.021 --> 00:02:24.930
It means that your actions have gone through a series of stages,

45
00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:29.580
but you arrive back at your starting point in some way to have the makings of

46
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:30.660
this is an idiom,

47
00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:34.740
which means to have the potential to become this city I'm comes from Henry the

48
00:02:34.741 --> 00:02:37.650
eighth. She had all the Royal makings of a queen.

49
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.900
The original meaning was a little different though.

50
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.350
It meant that she possessed things that gave her the appearance of a queen.

51
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.810
Not that she had the potential to become a queen.

52
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.890
Some idioms and vocabulary introduced by Shakespeare have evolved in meaning

53
00:02:49.891 --> 00:02:52.740
since then a foregone conclusion,

54
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.440
a term referring to a highly predictable outcome.

55
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.590
This is first found in the play a fellow named this was, but his dream,

56
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.770
but this denoted a foregone conclusion. In other words,

57
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:06.820
what happened in the dream most certainly happened in real life. And again,

58
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:10.360
what happened in the dream was something elicit of an adult nature,

59
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.420
neither rhyme, nor reason. This is an idiom,

60
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:16.780
meaning that something is completely lacking in logic and order.

61
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.630
It first appeared in writing in the comedy of errors,

62
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.860
but it's a translation of a similar phrase in French song, Lehman, new Hazel,

63
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.310
literally without rhyme or reason in modern day, English.

64
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.810
This idiom exists in a few variations like without rhyme or reason or no rhyme

65
00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:35.380
or reason. For example, there's no rhyme or reason for his behavior,

66
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.090
or he managed the office without rhyme or reason. One fell swoop.

67
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.500
This is an idiom referring to an action completed rapidly and all at once.

68
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.440
It first appeared in Macbeth, all my pretty ones. Did you say all, Oh,

69
00:03:49.441 --> 00:03:51.270
hell kite, all what?

70
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.930
All my pretty chickens and their at one fell swoop.

71
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.840
Macduff is talking about the murder of his family,

72
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.610
ordered by Macbeth and uses the metaphor of a dangerous birds swooping down to

73
00:04:02.611 --> 00:04:06.090
attack. The word fel is used here with its archaic,

74
00:04:06.091 --> 00:04:09.390
meaning of deadly as luck would have it.

75
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.740
This is an idiom indicating that something happened due to luck. For example,

76
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.590
I forgot my wallet at home, but as luck would have it,

77
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.600
there was a $20 bill in my pocket.

78
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.570
This first appeared in the Merry wives of Windsor.

79
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.040
You shall hear as good luck would have. It comes in one mistress page.

80
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.470
There are many more idioms like these,

81
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.100
some of which are mainly used in literary contexts and some of which are

82
00:04:32.101 --> 00:04:34.080
commonly used in everyday language.

83
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.960
And there are some which are still attributed to Shakespeare,

84
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.640
even though earlier appearances of the idiom are now known such as it's Greek.

85
00:04:41.641 --> 00:04:45.780
To me, more common these days in it's very informed. It's all Greek to me,

86
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.560
meaning you can't understand something at all. The vocabulary,

87
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.260
the vocabulary introduced by William Shakespeare,

88
00:04:52.261 --> 00:04:54.660
into English developed in a few different ways.

89
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.260
Some words were created by combining two existing words.

90
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.330
The adverb upstairs is a combination of up and stairs. Similarly,

91
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.680
downstairs is a combination of down plus stairs, birthplace,

92
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.840
eyeball watchdog,

93
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.460
Shakespeare introduced a number of compound adjectives consisting of an

94
00:05:14.461 --> 00:05:18.330
adjective and a past participle cold hearted cold blooded

95
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.220
well-behaved well-bred well-educated well-read ill

96
00:05:23.221 --> 00:05:27.450
tempered. Some words became used in different word classes.

97
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.350
After English lost much of its inflection in the middle English period,

98
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.130
it became easy for words from one class such as noun, adjective,

99
00:05:35.131 --> 00:05:39.810
or verb to be used in another class. Some verbs became used as nouns.

100
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.520
For example, the word bump.

101
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.580
It first appeared as a noun in the works of William Shakespeare,

102
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.360
but it existed as a verb before that similarly control.

103
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.340
When used as a noun and hint,

104
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.260
when used as a noun go between a noun referring to a middleman or liaison.

105
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.040
This comes from the verbal phrase go between.

106
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.380
And some nouns became used as verbs to torture. This first existed as a noun,

107
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.080
but Shakespeare used it as a verb to cater.

108
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.100
This is a verb meaning to supply food. This came from the middle English.

109
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.950
Now Katurah, meaning buyer of provisions,

110
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.600
many new words were created through adding affixes to existing words.

111
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:18.800
Successful.

112
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.510
This adjective was formed from the noun success by adding the suffix full

113
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.680
similarly useful is an adjective that came from the noun use.

114
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.300
Plus the suffix full something is full of use amazement.

115
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.860
The noun was formed from the verb amaze. With the addition of the suffix meant,

116
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.300
meant creates a noun referring to an action or the state resulting from that

117
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:45.410
action. Countless this adjective comes from the noun count.

118
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.910
Plus the suffix less, the suffix less indicates the absence of something.

119
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.120
So if something's priceless, it's too valuable for you to buy.

120
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.040
There's no price employer.

121
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.610
This is an agent now a noun for the Dewar of an action,

122
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.540
which was created by adding the suffix ER, to the verb employee.

123
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.510
And related to that is employment for this.

124
00:07:05.511 --> 00:07:08.090
Now the suffix ment was added to the verb.

125
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.060
The state that results from the action employer.

126
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.943
<v 1>Fashionable.</v>

127
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:17.300
<v 0>This adjective was created from the verb fashion, plus the suffix a bull.</v>

128
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:22.400
So it means able to be fashioned. In other words, able to be given good style.

129
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.080
Majestic Shakespeare created the adjective from the now majesty plus the

130
00:07:27.081 --> 00:07:30.500
adjective suffix it to misquote the prefix.

131
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.620
Miss simply adds the meaning of mistaken or wrong.

132
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.360
Some words were even created by removing affixes to impede.

133
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.940
This verb was created by removing the noun.

134
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.840
Forming suffix meant from impediment to negotiate.

135
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:49.700
This verb was formed by removing the non-conforming suffix shin Tio N from

136
00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:54.440
negotiation. Some existing words were given a new sense. Cheap.

137
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.710
This word had already existed with the meaning of low price,

138
00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:02.420
but Shakespeare used it with the sense of low quality or a vulgar flowery.

139
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:06.380
This word had already existed as an adjective related to flowers,

140
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:10.670
but William Shakespeare used it with the new sense of richly embellished speech.

141
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.250
For example, using lots of fancy adjectives,

142
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.270
some words were adopted from French and Latin retirement.

143
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.810
This word was taken from middle French hook deal originally,

144
00:08:20.811 --> 00:08:25.790
meaning active retreating and active withdrawing into seclusion Shakespeare.

145
00:08:25.791 --> 00:08:29.780
Didn't use it with its most common modern day meaning of coming to the end of

146
00:08:29.781 --> 00:08:33.860
your working life. The word generous was taken from French Geneva,

147
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:38.690
but it originally had a different sense from now meaning gentle noble or fair.

148
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:41.270
Some words are completely original,

149
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.270
whether they originated in colloquial speech or Shakespeare,

150
00:08:44.271 --> 00:08:47.150
created them to puke a colloquial word for.

151
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:48.573
<v 1>Okay.</v>

152
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:54.550
<v 0>That this word first appeared in the slang of street criminals. But in writing,</v>

153
00:08:54.551 --> 00:08:56.490
it was first in the works of Shakespeare.

154
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.810
Certain common co-locations were first found in the works of Shakespeare.

155
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.770
For example, on purpose, the something in question,

156
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.260
the thing we are focusing on, for example,

157
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:11.490
the document in question something you might hear in a formal legal or business

158
00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:12.324
context,

159
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.440
it's quite amazing that one man who wrote a collection of plays on poetry,

160
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.570
not only inspired our literary tradition,

161
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.810
but also had such a huge impact on the words we use every day,

162
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:23.190
without even realizing it.

163
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.570
English is now the defacto international language and people all around the

164
00:09:27.571 --> 00:09:27.990
world,

165
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:31.620
including people who learn English as a second language or foreign language,

166
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:36.300
use words and idioms either created by William Shakespeare or catapulted into

167
00:09:36.301 --> 00:09:38.820
the mainstream of modern English through his works.

168
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.070
And it's impressive on another level as well.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.490
It's a powerful reminder that by doing things we're passionate about,

170
00:09:44.491 --> 00:09:48.150
we can potentially have a long lasting impact on the world around us.

171
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.500
The question of the day,

172
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.680
which of the words and idioms in the video do you use regularly?

173
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.830
Did you know that they originated in the works of William Shakespeare?

174
00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.370
Leave your answers in the comments down below a big shout out,

175
00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:01.410
goes out to all of my Patrion supporters,

176
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.470
including these ones right here on the screen. They are my top two,

177

your Patrion supporters,

178
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.370
