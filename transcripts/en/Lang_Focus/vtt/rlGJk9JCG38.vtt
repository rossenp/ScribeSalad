and video lessons for students of all levels. Hello, everyone.

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.430
Welcome to the Lang focus channel. And my name is Paul. Today.

6
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.540
We're going to compare two languages that are closely related to each other,

7
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.930
and similar in many ways, but also quite different from each other.

8
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.180
With limited mutual intelligibility.

9
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.710
I'm talking about two non-Indian European languages have Northern Europe,

10
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.560
Finnish and Estonian Finnish,

11
00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:37.830
and dystonias are both members of the FinTech group of languages.

12
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.870
Along with Karelian ludic,

13
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.130
VIPs Ingredion vo-tech and Lavonia.

14
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.450
Their most recent common ancestor language was late [inaudible] around 2000

15
00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:53.370
years ago. Finnick is a branch of the erratic language family.

16
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.560
So they are both more distantly related to Hungarian as well since Finnish

17
00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:02.640
and Astonian have been developing in different directions for 2000 years.

18
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.540
There are now fairly different with Astonian being much more innovative while

19
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:10.620
Finnish is more conservative. In other words, Estonian has changed more.

20
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.650
They're not mutually intelligible for the most part.

21
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.230
Aside from basic general vocabulary,

22
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.520
Estonian speakers generally understand finish better than finished speakers.

23
00:01:20.521 --> 00:01:24.420
Understand Astonian because of exposure to Finnish media.

24
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.200
The way I understand that this is much less the case among the young generations

25
00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:29.030
today,

26
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.030
let's look at a few common phrases in either language and see what's similar and

27
00:01:33.031 --> 00:01:37.860
what's different about them. Hello in Finnish, Hey, and in Estonia.

28
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.730
<v 1>Better or better beast.</v>

29
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.080
<v 0>This word literally means health. The T here is a positive case.</v>

30
00:01:45.081 --> 00:01:49.700
Inflection positive is the case used for direct objects when they are partial

31
00:01:49.701 --> 00:01:51.710
object, rather than complete ones

32
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.640
is a contraction of, of East.

33
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.960
But finish also has the formal word for hello,

34
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.610
which literally means healthy.

35
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.740
This is a cognate with the Estonian word data-based except [inaudible] is an

36
00:02:06.741 --> 00:02:11.540
adjective rather than a noun in Estonia is

37
00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:15.590
used with many greetings. Well in Finnish is used,

38
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.210
is Stony and has a cognate of this word. Yeah, they both mean good.

39
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.120
Good morning in finish.

40
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.210
This now is in the positive case and is a literary word for morning in finish

41
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.210
in a stolen ghost here.

42
00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:36.200
You can see that these two words are cognates and both come from [inaudible]

43
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.830
whole men, but the Estonian word is in the LA TIF case,

44
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.750
which is used with the sense of from or out of good day or

45
00:02:44.751 --> 00:02:48.950
good afternoon in Finnish. And in Estonian

46
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.450
again, here, you can see that these two words are cognates.

47
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.590
These cognates reveal an important difference between Finnish and Estonian

48
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.710
Finnish uses vowel harmony while Astonian no longer uses vowel harmony,

49
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.650
except in some archaic expressions in Finnish,

50
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.430
there are three classes of vowels, front vowels, neutral vowels,

51
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.850
and back vowels. If a word content's front vowels,

52
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.550
it cannot contain back vowels and vice versa.

53
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.480
This also applies to the word suffixes by Eva.

54
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.170
This is a front vowel. So aside from this neutral vowel,

55
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.400
the other vowel is also a front vowel here.

56
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.680
We see a front vowel and a neutral vowel,

57
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.750
but there's a back vowel in the suffix.

58
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.530
This word doesn't exhibit the same vowel harmony as the finished word,

59
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.670
but it's worth noting that vowel harmony may be seen in Southern Estonian

60
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:40.504
dialect.

61
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.570
Good evening in Finnish and in Estonian

62
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.280
dust. In this case, these phrases contain no cognate words.

63
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.620
What's your name and finish [inaudible] word for word.

64
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.570
What your name is.

65
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.850
One is the genitive inflection of the personal pronoun. See, now see,

66
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.360
moon also has a short form that is used in informal speech.

67
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.450
<v 1>[Inaudible] on in Estonia.</v>

68
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.410
<v 0>And Messina and, and just like I can finish.</v>

69
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.420
Estonian also has a short form of the genitive pronoun miso Nemean whether we

70
00:04:18.421 --> 00:04:20.310
use the long forms or the short forms,

71
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.730
you can see that the Finnish and Estonian sentences are pretty close to each

72
00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:24.540
other.

73
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.920
One difference is the word for what another difference is the form of the word

74
00:04:28.921 --> 00:04:30.660
for name in finished.

75
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.610
The basic nominative form is Nimi like in Estonian, but in finish,

76
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.220
there are special possessive forms of the nominative.

77
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.220
When there's a genitive pronoun to show possession,

78
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.850
a corresponding possessive suffix is added to the end of the now.

79
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.990
And in this case, it changes the final vowel though, that doesn't always happen.

80
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.450
The full suffix C is used in formal written finish wireless shortened.

81
00:04:54.451 --> 00:04:58.440
Suffix is usually used in spoken finish, or the suffix is dropped.

82
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.350
[inaudible] when the suffix is dropped,

83
00:05:01.351 --> 00:05:05.910
it's more like the Estonian sentence possessive suffix has disappeared from

84
00:05:05.911 --> 00:05:09.240
Astonian in the 17th century. So, whereas in finished,

85
00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:13.110
you can say a possessive sentence without the genitive personal pronoun in

86
00:05:13.111 --> 00:05:16.050
Estonian, you need it. For example, in the sentences,

87
00:05:16.051 --> 00:05:20.010
meaning my name is in Finnish Nima. Any own here.

88
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.940
There's no genitive pronoun, but there's a possessive suffix in Estonian Mino.

89
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.220
Nemean here. There's a genitive pronoun, but there's no possessive suffix,

90
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.890
false friends. So far,

91
00:05:31.891 --> 00:05:35.130
we've seen that some words are different and other words are cognates.

92
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.060
While those cognates often have different forms or different inflectional forms,

93
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.630
but as with most languages that are closely related to each other,

94
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.890
there are also some false friends, cognates that look and sound similar,

95
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.680
but actually have different meanings. For example,

96
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.720
in Finnish gory star means to decorate the Estonian word,

97
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.780
goody STEMA means to clean the core meaning of these words is to make beautiful.

98
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.650
So you can see how that developed into both of their present meanings in

99
00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:08.360
Finnish. Maya means a shelter or a Treehouse. And in Estonia one,

100
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.300
Maya is the regular word for house.

101
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.560
The finished word horny means a room. The Estonian.

102
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.390
<v 2>Word means a big.</v>

103
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:21.320
<v 0>Building. The Finnish word. It means a cabin,</v>

104
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.290
but a cabin on a boat. The Estonian word,

105
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.180
who means a hut or a shack, both of these words are dramatic.

106
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.960
Lone words,

107
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.890
the Finnish one from Swedish and the Estonian one from old high German.

108
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.320
The finished word means Bible. The Estonian.

109
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.750
<v 2>Word means book.</v>

110
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.090
<v 0>The word for a book and finish is,</v>

111
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.370
and the word for Bible and Astonian is finish,

112
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.890
is much more conservative in its vocabulary,

113
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.850
meaning that there have been strong efforts to use Finnish words or coin new

114
00:06:55.851 --> 00:07:00.230
words from finished routes instead of adopting loan words for modern objects and

115
00:07:00.231 --> 00:07:04.190
concepts. For example, in Estonia, the word for telephone is

116
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.650
finish, had the word [inaudible], but replaced it with full hailing.

117
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.020
Estonian contains many lone words,

118
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.290
especially from middle low German and German finish.

119
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.660
It sticks to its finished routes for most of these,

120
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.100
the word for kitchen in finish gate and in Estonian,

121
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:27.410
the finished word was coined in the 19th century from the word meaning to cook

122
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.290
plus a suffix that forms nouns from verbs.

123
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:35.150
The Estonian word comes from middle low German where finished does use lone

124
00:07:35.151 --> 00:07:37.010
words. They're often from Swedish,

125
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.770
as we saw in a previous pair of false friends.

126
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.420
Another example is the words for doctor in finish lack Addie,

127
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.080
which comes from Swedish and an Estonian artist,

128
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:53.040
which comes from middle low German grammar finish and dystonia

129
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.220
have many grammatical features in common,

130
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.280
both Finnish and Estonian are synthetic languages.

131
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.240
That means that meaning can be added to a sentence by adding additional

132
00:08:02.241 --> 00:08:05.390
morphemes to a word rather than adding additional words,

133
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:09.530
both have a combination of a gluten aiding and fusional elements though.

134
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.550
Astonian has become somewhat less synthetic with the loss of some inflectional

135
00:08:13.551 --> 00:08:17.360
affixes, like the loss of the possessive suffix as we saw before.

136
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:22.250
Another example is that Estonian verbs in their negative conjugation have no

137
00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:26.060
affixes showing person making subject pronouns necessary.

138
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:30.620
Unlike in Finnish, neither language has grammatical gender.

139
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.410
There are no masculine, feminine neuter distinctions,

140
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:38.660
neither language has articles like that. Or ah, in English, for example,

141
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:43.730
in Finnish, Bala means either the house or our house, and also in Estonian.

142
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:46.760
Maya means either the house or our house,

143
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:51.620
both Finnish and Estonian have both prepositions and post positions.

144
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.830
Neither language has a separate future tense.

145
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.320
The present is also used for the future. For example,

146
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.820
these sentences can mean either I study English or I will study English in

147
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.090
Finnish [inaudible] England and in Estonian,

148
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:12.000
But the Estonian sentence actually needs some more context in order to be

149
00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:16.560
interpreted as future tents. If you add an adverb of time like tomorrow,

150
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:19.350
then we'll know it's future tense rather than present tense.

151
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:21.630
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

152
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:26.220
<v 0>Without that context, the word HOK con could be used to indicate the future.</v>

153
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.330
It literally means start, but as used, like going to an English.

154
00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:31.640
<v 1>Mohawk and English.</v>

155
00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.460
<v 0>Finnish and dystonia have similar case systems,</v>

156
00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.270
Finnish has 15 cases while Astonian has 14, though,

157
00:09:41.271 --> 00:09:43.880
there are two others that are sometimes included as well.

158
00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:48.140
There's no accusative case on the Estonian list, but as unfinished,

159
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:52.250
the accusative form is the same as either the nominative or the genitive form

160
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.410
grammatical differences. The inflections are different between the languages.

161
00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:01.610
Of course, we saw some examples of that before in verb conjugations.

162
00:10:01.611 --> 00:10:02.840
And in case inflections,

163
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:08.150
Estonian syntax has some influence from low German and German. For example,

164
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:12.650
Astonian often uses post positions, whereas in finish a case would be used,

165
00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:16.010
for example, the phrase, meaning on the table and finish.

166
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:21.560
And in Estonia LOA, the finished noun is in the [inaudible] case,

167
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.940
which gives the meaning of aunt or at in Estonian. There's a separate word,

168
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.870
a post position,

169
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:31.850
meaning on in Finnish subject pronouns are normally left out

170
00:10:31.851 --> 00:10:34.790
for the first and second person except for emphasis.

171
00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.590
But the third person is required.

172
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.830
That's in the written formal language in casual speech.

173
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:43.640
The pronouns are normally used though. Not always in Estonian.

174
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:46.940
They're more often left out in casual speech. For example,

175
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:51.180
these sentences mean I read a book first and formal finish me and Lewin

176
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:55.040
[inaudible] and an informal finish [inaudible].

177
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.350
And in Estonian with the pronouns.

178
00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:02.120
<v 1>Malaga is in drama to lobby and without the pronoun, no guys in drama to lobby.</v>

179
00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:04.310
<v 0>And finish the use of the pronoun,</v>

180
00:11:04.311 --> 00:11:08.390
depends more on the register with the pronoun normally dropped in formal written

181
00:11:08.391 --> 00:11:12.440
finish, but included in spoken, finish in Astonian the use of the pronoun.

182
00:11:12.441 --> 00:11:14.240
Doesn't really depend on the register.

183
00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:18.800
It's normal to either use or drop the pronoun in both formal written and spoken

184
00:11:18.801 --> 00:11:22.010
Estonian. One other difference here is that an Estonian,

185
00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.540
the word lobby is necessary because the object here is a whole object.

186
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:28.070
Like the accusative case.

187
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.790
It adds the meaning of through like I read through the whole book,

188
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.810
this word would be unnecessary. If the noun was in the positive case,

189
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.770
referring to only part of the book next,

190
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.670
we're going to simply dive into some sentences and see what we find these

191
00:11:43.671 --> 00:11:47.570
sentences mean. I study literature in university in finish

192
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:51.680
[inaudible] I,

193
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:55.360
I study literature in university and in a story.

194
00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.350
<v 1>[Inaudible] just word for word. Yeah.</v>

195
00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.890
<v 0>I study in university literature first.</v>

196
00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:05.850
Notice that the finish sentence contains a subject pronoun while the Estonian

197
00:12:05.851 --> 00:12:09.870
sentence doesn't remember that in either language people can use or drop the

198
00:12:09.871 --> 00:12:10.470
pronoun,

199
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:14.220
but in speech it's normally used in finish while it's more often dropped and

200
00:12:14.221 --> 00:12:18.660
spoken Estonian. Next, we see a pair of cognates, meaning study will.

201
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.060
<v 1>Be skilling the bin. There's.</v>

202
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.440
<v 0>An interesting difference here.</v>

203
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.590
The finished verb has a suffix that makes it frequent dative,

204
00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:27.810
meaning it shows a repeated action.

205
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:31.440
It changes the meaning of the verb from learn to study.

206
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:36.300
But if we remove the suffix, it's a lot more like the Estonian word open.

207
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:39.900
The Estonian word can be used as it is with the meaning of study,

208
00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:44.610
even though it also means learn. Next, the words for literature are cognates.

209
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:49.020
Both are in the positive case. The case used for partial direct objects.

210
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.160
In this case, the person doesn't study literature in all its entirety.

211
00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.270
That would be impossible.

212
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.300
The person studies only part of the literature available.

213
00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.940
So the positive cases used, but obviously,

214
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.550
even though the same cases used in both languages,

215
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.370
the infectional forms are rather different. Next,

216
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.090
the words for a university are different though. Both are in the NSF case,

217
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:13.620
which adds the meaning of in note that the inflection of the finished word is an

218
00:13:13.621 --> 00:13:15.330
abbreviated colloquial form.

219
00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:19.380
It matches the informality of the sentence shown by the short pronoun.

220
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.650
And one more sentence, if you drove more slowly,

221
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.350
I would be able to read the map and finish. Yeah.

222
00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:29.130
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

223
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:30.000
<v 0>Word for word it's.</v>

224
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:34.620
If you would drive more slowly than I would be able to

225
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:36.580
read map and in Astonia.

226
00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:40.380
<v 1>[Inaudible] [inaudible].</v>

227
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.980
<v 0>Word for word it's. If you, more slowly you would drive,</v>

228
00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:48.480
I would be able to map read first. We see different words.

229
00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:51.660
Meaning if here finish has no pronoun,

230
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:55.440
which tells us this is likely more formal finish in Estonian.

231
00:13:55.441 --> 00:13:59.550
The pronoun is present, which is common in both formal and informal registers.

232
00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:02.340
Next, we see two different verbs, meaning drive,

233
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.130
but both are in the second person, singular conditional.

234
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.560
I'm sure you notice the difference in word order.

235
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.280
This is interesting because in Estonia, the verb comes at the end of the,

236
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.150
if clause,

237
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:16.950
this likely shows the influence of low German or old high German in German and

238
00:14:16.951 --> 00:14:17.580
low German.

239
00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:22.020
The conjugated verb comes at the end of subordinate clauses of which if clauses

240
00:14:22.021 --> 00:14:25.530
are one type, if we skip ahead to the second part of the sentence,

241
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:28.710
the main clause, we also see word order that looks dramatic.

242
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:33.000
The auxiliary verb is at the beginning and the lexical verb comes at the end of

243
00:14:33.001 --> 00:14:33.810
the clause.

244
00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:38.130
The auxiliary verb is not in second position as in German or low German because

245
00:14:38.131 --> 00:14:42.210
the subject pronoun is dropped here. But we did see that word order before.

246
00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.170
And this sense.

247
00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.600
<v 1>Mohawk and English. Yeah.</v>

248
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.390
<v 0>Here, the conjugated verb is in the second position.</v>

249
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.950
And the second verb comes at the end as in German or low German.

250
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.910
Next, we see two different comparative adverbs.

251
00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:00.890
Meaning more slowly in Finnish adverbs are formed by adding steep to

252
00:15:00.891 --> 00:15:05.120
the inflecting form of the adjective. Then to form the comparative adverb.

253
00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.250
Steet is replaced by mean in a Stoney.

254
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:12.560
The STEM of adverbs is the genitive singular form of the adjective. To that.

255
00:15:12.561 --> 00:15:16.340
We add the suffix LT then to make the adverb comparative,

256
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:21.050
you remove that ending and add malt next in the finished sentence,

257
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:25.960
we see Nene meaning then to show the outcome of a condition. But in Estonia,

258
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:28.850
that's not used. There is a word that can be used.

259
00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:33.760
Cease serves the same function, but the sentence is fine without it in Finnish,

260
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:37.270
it's better to include the word Nene and the sentence would say sound a bit

261
00:15:37.271 --> 00:15:40.390
strange without it. Next, we see two different verbs.

262
00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.600
Meaning I would be able to both are in the first person,

263
00:15:43.601 --> 00:15:48.280
singular conditional mood. Next we have two cognitive verbs meaning to read,

264
00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:51.760
but these two verbs reveal a grammatical difference between finished and

265
00:15:51.761 --> 00:15:52.594
dystonia.

266
00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:57.460
The finished verb is a third active infinitive in the elites of case finish

267
00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:01.000
has five different infinitive forms. And this one is used in verb.

268
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.900
Chan's like this Estonian has only two types of infinitive,

269
00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:09.820
the Maya infinitive and the die infinitive. This one is the die infinitive.

270
00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:14.290
The die infinitive is used when something may or may not actually occur.

271
00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.770
Whereas the Maya infinitive is used for things that are certain,

272
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:22.240
the [inaudible] is used in sentences, meaning things like she can,

273
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:27.070
or he may, or we want et cetera, because the action is not certain.

274
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:32.110
And after that, we have cognate words for map both in the positive case,

275
00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:36.130
but with different inflectional forms, as you can see,

276
00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.750
Finnish and dystonia function very similarly and their shared roots are obvious,

277
00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:44.590
but it's also obvious that they split off from each other a very long time ago.

278
00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:49.270
Estonian is by far the more innovative language and readily open to changes

279
00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:53.020
while Finnish is much more conservative, at least standard finish.

280
00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.170
If we introduced finished dialects into the comparison,

281
00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.970
there might be more similarities with Estonian standard Astonian was based more

282
00:17:00.971 --> 00:17:03.790
on Northern Estonian dialects as they were spoken.

283
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:08.530
Whereas standard finish was based more on conservative forms that were common to

284
00:17:08.531 --> 00:17:10.570
all or most finished dialects.

285
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:14.080
The question of the day for speakers of Finnish and Estonian.

286
00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.570
How well do you understand the other language?

287
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.320
Do you think exposure to the other language would be enough to get used to it

288
00:17:20.321 --> 00:17:22.060
and understand it for other people?

289
00:17:22.061 --> 00:17:25.600
What's your impression of these two languages? How similar to they seem to you?

290
00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:27.550
If you're in the student learning finish,

291
00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:31.270
I recommend you click the link in the description to check out finished pod one

292
00:17:31.271 --> 00:17:32.080
Oh one.
