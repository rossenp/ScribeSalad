00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.440
<v 0>Three, two, one Aloha. Welcome to the Lang focus channel.</v>

2
00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:06.480
And my name is Paul. Today.

3
00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:10.680
We're going to focus on the Hawaiian language or all

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.690
[inaudible] in Hawaiian. Obviously it's a language of Hawaii. Wait,

5
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.160
let me say that again, Hawaii. Yeah. Notice there's a glottal stop right there.

6
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.413
Have I eat?

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.310
Of course it's no longer the main language of Hawaii or even a widely spoken one

8
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.560
only around 18,000 of Hawaii's 1.4 million people speak it at home.

9
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.440
That's according to the U S census of 2010,

10
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.280
and there's only one place in the world where it's the native language and the

11
00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:41.370
main language of the population, the Island of Niihau,

12
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.400
which has a population of only around 160.

13
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.490
But even though it's not widely spoken anymore,

14
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.970
you do see and hear a lot of Hawaiian words in Hawaii.

15
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.140
You'll most definitely hear a low, hot meaning, both hello and goodbye,

16
00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.330
but actually literally means love Aloha Mahalo, meaning thank you, Mahalo.

17
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.740
And you'll encounter countless Hawaiian place names like Waikiki,

18
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.920
which means spouting water is water.

19
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.330
Allah means ocean path or path to the sea.

20
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.950
Allah is path or way Milena is sea or ocean

21
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.600
and lots of shops and businesses use Hawaiian words in their names like the

22
00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:24.510
hotel. My wife and I recently stayed at Ohana.

23
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.080
Malia Waikiki Ohana means family Ohana,

24
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.700
and this word Coca-Cola means help. And here we see Mahalo again.

25
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.740
So you can see that in Hawaii,

26
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.830
Hawaiian words are sometimes thrown in when using English,

27
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.990
the first Hawaiian people migrated to the islands from other parts of Polynesia.

28
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.550
We don't know when exactly,

29
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.420
but the common theory is that the first wave of migrations came from the Mar

30
00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:53.190
CASIS islands as early as 400 CE followed by a second wave of migration

31
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.820
from Tahiti several centuries later, as a result of that,

32
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.960
Hawaiian shares many similarities with the Mark Casen and Tahitian languages.

33
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.500
Despite the geographic distance European explorers,

34
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.190
notice the similarities and thought that all the languages were dialects of a

35
00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:09.780
single Polynesian language.

36
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.700
But at least now there are plenty of differences too. When British Explorer,

37
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.630
captain James Cook first reached Hawaii in 1778,

38
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.620
the population was around 300,000 and they all spoke Hawaiian

39
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.780
American missionary soon arrived as well as American businessmen who established

40
00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:32.220
sugarcane plantations along with them came diseases such as smallpox,

41
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.760
which wiped out much of the native population by 1860.

42
00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:39.870
There were only around 60,000 native Hawaiians. And by 1920,

43
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.310
only 24,000 many immigrants also came to Hawaii to work on

44
00:02:44.311 --> 00:02:48.330
plantations. During this period from Asian countries like Japan, China,

45
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.650
and Philippines speaking, their respective languages in 1893,

46
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.940
the kingdom of Hawaii was overthrown with the intention of annexing it to the

47
00:02:56.941 --> 00:02:59.290
United States. In 1896,

48
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.670
a law was passed making English the language of instruction in Hawaiian schools.

49
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.080
Hawaiian was not made illegal to speak, but at school children were disciplined.

50
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:12.820
If they spoke Hawaiian this along with the largely decimated native population,

51
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.840
put the Hawaiian language at serious risk of dying out over the next century.

52
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.970
It's a language that many predicted would be dead by now, but in recent decades,

53
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:26.020
there's been more attention to preserving and promoting the language in the

54
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:26.860
1980s.

55
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.180
New Hawaiian immersion schools began to be established including immersion

56
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:35.680
preschools in 1979, before the establishment of the schools,

57
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.250
there were only around 800 native speakers of Hawaiian remaining.

58
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.680
But now according to the latest us census,

59
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.070
there were around 18,000 people who speak Hawaiian at home.

60
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.130
That doesn't necessarily mean it's their first language,

61
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.810
but that they are fluent speakers.

62
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.260
And many of them must be among the people who studied at immersion schools.

63
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.650
Now let's take a look at some of the languages. Key features,

64
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.540
pronunciation and orthography.

65
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.810
Hawaiian is written with only eight consonant letters.

66
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.550
One is a glottal stop called Okinawa. We heard it before in Hawaii.

67
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:07.210
Again,

68
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.920
notice that Hawaii also note that certain letters can represent two

69
00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:14.590
different sounds depending on the dialect or accent,

70
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.950
but spelling is now standardized to these particular letters.

71
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.020
The letter w can represent woop or it's more commonly pronounced

72
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.740
these days, but it depends on the speaker and the dialect,

73
00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:30.250
their speeches influenced by it as well as on the surrounding sounds,

74
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.320
Hawaiian has five vowels,

75
00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.080
a E O O plus [inaudible] Elian placed over

76
00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:40.360
a vowel to indicate that it's a long vowel.

77
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.720
There are no consonant clusters in Hawaiian. In other words,

78
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.740
there are never two consonants in a row. Every syllable ends in a vowel,

79
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.510
a Loha Maha lo or Hannah, et cetera.

80
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.290
The stress of a word usually falls on the penultimate syllable.

81
00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.030
The second last syllable, here are some basic phrases in Hawaiian.

82
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.290
We've seen the first one already. Aloha. Hello, goodbye or love.

83
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.450
<v 1>Aloha. Good.</v>

84
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.750
<v 0>Morning between the hours of about 6:00 AM to 10:00 AM.</v>

85
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.670
<v 1>Kia. Good.</v>

86
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.950
<v 0>Day from around 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM.</v>

87
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.590
<v 1>Aloha good afternoon.</v>

88
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.540
<v 0>From around 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM.</v>

89
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.830
Aloha good evening from around 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM.

90
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.030
<v 1>Be here or how are you?</v>

91
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.680
Make a you on good awake quinoa. What's your name?

92
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.810
[inaudible].

93
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:34.650
<v 0>My name is Kai.</v>

94
00:05:34.651 --> 00:05:39.420
Noah notice here that Cole your and co my are two completely

95
00:05:39.421 --> 00:05:43.080
different words. So you can't skip the glottal stop in Hawaiian words.

96
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.600
<v 1>[Inaudible] please Mahalo. Thank you. Hey Mikey.</v>

97
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.420
<v 0>You're welcome. Literally a little thing.</v>

98
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.830
Let's examine the word order of Hawaiian a little bit. Look at the sentence,

99
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.160
make it doesn't have a verb,

100
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.930
but notice that the predicate comes first and the subject comes second word for

101
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:06.650
word. It's good. I, this is very common in Austronesian.

102
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:10.460
Languages ended immediately reminded me of Tagalog a language of the

103
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:11.294
Philippines.

104
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.710
<v 1>Okay. Norco. We know.</v>

105
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.970
<v 0>Word for word it's personal topic. Marker. Kai Noah. My name,</v>

106
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.120
the subject is co UE Noah and the predicate is okay.

107
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.920
You Noah also it's similar. If the predicate is an adjective.

108
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.410
<v 1>And then Nika Bohemia, the woman is beautiful.</v>

109
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.620
<v 0>Literally beautiful. The woman. And that's a full sentence.</v>

110
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.910
[inaudible] means the beautiful woman and is not a full sentence.

111
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.260
There's no predicate. It's simply a noun phrase in Hawaiian noun phrases.

112
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.280
If there's an adjective, the adjective comes after the noun. Whereas in English,

113
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.860
it comes before it another example.

114
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.200
<v 1>New [inaudible] means the house is big, but [inaudible].</v>

115
00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.680
<v 0>It means that the big house, if we had a verb,</v>

116
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.390
we can see that Hawaiian is VSO. Aloha. Yeah. I love you.

117
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.300
Word for word. Love I,

118
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.880
you and you can see that it's V S O verb,

119
00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:06.730
subject object as a side note. Oh,

120
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.060
is the first person singular subject pronoun. Yeah. Oh,

121
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.940
is the second person singular object pronoun.

122
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:16.840
<v 1>[Inaudible] I want.</v>

123
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.520
<v 0>Some water word for word.</v>

124
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:22.540
Want I direct object marker the water again.

125
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.950
We see that the verb comes first followed by the subject then by the object,

126
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.930
this word E is a direct object marker that is used before common knelt.

127
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:37.060
So now we have an idea of the most basic word order of Hawaiian articles

128
00:07:37.061 --> 00:07:40.540
and determiners. We've seen many nouns proceeded by cup.

129
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:44.950
This is a definite article. There's one more K K is used before.

130
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.140
Now it's beginning with K E a or O like kumu the teacher

131
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.110
before now it's starting with any other letter it's caught,

132
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:54.220
which is more common.

133
00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:59.380
There's also a plural definite article NA NA Kumo, the teachers.

134
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.940
There's also an indefinite article. Hey, Hey, Como a teacher.

135
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:08.080
You can make the indefinite now in plural by adding a plural marker.

136
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.030
<v 1>Mo [inaudible].</v>

137
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.420
<v 0>Teachers. Similarly, there are demonstratives.</v>

138
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.360
<v 1>Okay. Yeah, it means this [inaudible]. This cat can NA means that.</v>

139
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.440
<v 0>That for things that are near the listener can not that cat.</v>

140
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:25.960
<v 1>Can LA means that for things.</v>

141
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.300
<v 0>That are far from both the speaker and the listener.</v>

142
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:30.063
<v 1>Kayla.</v>

143
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:35.200
<v 0>To make the demonstrative plural, you can add Mo key, your mobile bookie.</v>

144
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.990
These cats. Now let's look at possessives.

145
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.630
<v 1>Or co Evo. Kayla, that's.</v>

146
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:44.470
<v 0>My dog over there. Word for word it's equative sentence. Marker.</v>

147
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:49.480
My dog that in the distance, just a quick note about, Oh,

148
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.600
this word comes at the beginning of equative sentences,

149
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:55.230
which are used to specifically identify something.

150
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.580
But back to the main point here, this word here is a possessive meaning.

151
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:04.530
My possessives in Hawaiian are interesting because there's more than one version

152
00:09:04.531 --> 00:09:07.440
of each one is an A-class possessive.

153
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:11.670
A-class possessives are used for things you can choose whether to possess or

154
00:09:11.671 --> 00:09:13.230
not. If you have a dog,

155
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:16.440
you probably chose to buy it and can choose to get rid of it.

156
00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.460
Of course you probably won't because dogs are man's best friend, but you know,

157
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.270
you could,

158
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:26.160
the OIC last equivalent is co w O class possessives are mainly used with

159
00:09:26.161 --> 00:09:29.910
nouns that you cannot choose to possess. You inherently possess them.

160
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.550
<v 1>Or [inaudible].</v>

161
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.270
<v 0>This is my sister. You can't decide whether you have a sister or not.</v>

162
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.620
So this is old class.

163
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:42.210
There is an exception for this for family members below you in your family tree,

164
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.860
like children and grandchildren,

165
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.120
a classes used A-class can be used for things that you create.

166
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.420
And I guess you create your children, making them A-class

167
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.050
things like body parts are also okay.

168
00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.430
<v 1>[Inaudible] I mean, it's my eye, Colima.</v>

169
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.680
<v 0>My arm or my hand, et cetera.</v>

170
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.270
One caveat is that clothing and structures that you can enter or ride are also

171
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:08.990
old class as though they are extensions of your body.

172
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.480
<v 1>Or [inaudible]. That.</v>

173
00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.220
<v 0>Is our house over there.</v>

174
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.120
Notes that with Hawaiian possessives and Hawaiian personal pronouns,

175
00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:21.170
there is first person plural inclusive. In other words, we,

176
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:25.550
or our includes the listener and first person plural exclusive.

177
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.090
In other words, we, or our doesn't include the listener.

178
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.170
This is common in Austronesian languages. I've seen something similar in Malay,

179
00:10:33.171 --> 00:10:36.350
Indonesian and toget log. This possessive here, Cole,

180
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.280
Marco excludes the listener. One more thing,

181
00:10:40.281 --> 00:10:44.270
which is special about Hawaiian possessives and personal pronouns is that there

182
00:10:44.271 --> 00:10:47.930
is not just one set of plural forms. There are dual forms,

183
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.050
which refer to pairs of people. And there are plural forms,

184
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.150
which refer to groups of three or more.

185
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.970
<v 1>New Ecolab, their.</v>

186
00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.240
<v 0>Houses big, this refers to three or more people's house.</v>

187
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.940
But if I said lower [inaudible], it would refer to two people's

188
00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:01.940
 house. Now let's look a little more closely at verbs you saw before that there

189
00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:01.940
is

190
00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:01.940
 no verb, meaning to be another important thing to point out is that verbs are not conjugated 

191
00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:02.773
for person or number. They stayed the same regardless of the subject.

192
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:23.210
<v 1>He Minio. I sing he mini oil. You sing, he mini oil.</v>

193
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.360
He sings, or she sings. He mini LACOE.

194
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:27.973
<v 0>And so on</v>

195
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:34.100
tense aspect and mood markers are used before or after the verb to indicate the

196
00:11:34.101 --> 00:11:37.070
relationship of action to time. For example,

197
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:41.180
K plus verb plus ne equals the present continuous.

198
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.130
<v 1>[Inaudible]. I am.</v>

199
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:47.150
<v 0>Working watch. Plus verb equals the perfective aspect,</v>

200
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.700
showing that an action is complete. Often.

201
00:11:49.701 --> 00:11:54.370
This translates as the past tense [inaudible] I or I have worked

202
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:59.020
a plus verb plus Ana equals the imperfection of aspect,

203
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.260
which indicates that an action has not been completed.

204
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.320
This often translates as the future tense in English,

205
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.680
but can also be used for an incomplete action. In the past,

206
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:15.040
I will work or I was working a plus the verb equals the

207
00:12:15.041 --> 00:12:17.620
imperative form. It work.

208
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:22.840
It can also function as the infinitive to work for the negative imperative you

209
00:12:22.841 --> 00:12:25.390
use my [inaudible] don't work.

210
00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:29.740
Now let's look at a final sentence in Hawaiian and break it down.

211
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.380
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

212
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.670
<v 0>I went shopping with my friends on Sunday word for word it's perfective marker,</v>

213
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:39.240
go.

214
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.860
I infinitive shop with my plural marker friend

215
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:48.330
on the Sunday. First we see the perfective aspect marker,

216
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:51.480
which shows that this action is complete. Again,

217
00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:55.740
notice that the sentence is verb initial. The subject comes after the verb.

218
00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.710
Next we see the infinitive form of the verb,

219
00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:03.720
meaning to buy or shop next may is a preposition meaning with

220
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:08.520
there are a few prepositions in Hawaiian E meaning two on it or

221
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.670
at ma meaning on it or at,

222
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:15.780
but not to may meaning with O and ah,

223
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:20.250
meaning of there are two forms here because there's a distinction between Oh,

224
00:13:20.251 --> 00:13:23.010
class and A-class and no,

225
00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:27.180
and not meaning belonging to again, the first one is, Oh, class.

226
00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:31.380
And the second one is a class. Next we see the possessive coat. Ooh,

227
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:36.570
meaning my or mine, which is, Oh, class friends are treated as Oh class,

228
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.810
whereas A-class would indicate a romantic relationship.

229
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.530
Mo is the plural marker making Hawaii Aloha plural.

230
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.530
And here's another one of those prepositions in this case,

231
00:13:46.531 --> 00:13:51.360
meaning on and Gullah Pula means Sunday being the definite

232
00:13:51.361 --> 00:13:55.050
article. Hawaiian is a fun language,

233
00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.990
a logical language and an accessible language.

234
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.650
It's not difficult to learn a little bit and get started speaking fairly

235
00:14:01.651 --> 00:14:04.560
quickly, especially thanks to its simple phonology.

236
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.800
Unfortunately there aren't that many people to speak with,

237
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:12.090
but with the increasing number of second language speakers, since the 1980s,

238
00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:16.020
hopefully Hawaiian will continue to regain some of its former glory.

239
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.020
Duolingo actually has a Hawaiian course now,

240
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:23.250
and it's an easy way to experience a little of this fun language to see if you

241
00:14:23.251 --> 00:14:26.550
like it. The question of the day for speakers of Hawaiian,

242
00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:28.110
if there are any of you watching,

243
00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:32.700
how much do you speak Hawaiian on a day-to-day basis and in what situations and

244
00:14:32.701 --> 00:14:36.330
for other people, what's your impression of Hawaiian after seeing this video,

245

247

And as always, I want to say a special thanks to my Patrion supporters.

248
00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:49.590

249
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.850
