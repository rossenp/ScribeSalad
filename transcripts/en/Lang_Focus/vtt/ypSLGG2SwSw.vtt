00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.740
<v 0>Hello everyone today, we're going to talk about a fascinating topic.</v>

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.930
Albinos albinos are humans or other living things that lack

3
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:12.570
pigmentation or coloration in humans.

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.270
This results in white hair and very light skin.

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.040
That's highly sensitive to sunlight.

6
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.843
<v 1>Yeah. What is it?</v>

7
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.190
[inaudible].

8
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.330
<v 0>Welcome to the Lang focus channel. And my name is Paul. Today.</v>

9
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.780
We're going to talk about a language whose relationship to other modern

10
00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:46.040
languages is not exactly known that language is Albanian

11
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.160
or ship as it's called an Albanian.

12
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.190
Albanian is an Indo-European language.

13
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.630
You may be wondering which branch of Indo-European is it a romance language,

14
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.860
a Slavic language, a Germanic language. How about a Celtic language,

15
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.410
a Hellenic language? Nope.

16
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.390
Albanian is a language isolate within the Indo-European language family,

17
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.590
meaning that it forms its own branch of Indo-European to which no other modern

18
00:01:12.591 --> 00:01:13.640
languages belong.

19
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.900
The most common theory among scholars is that Albanian developed from the

20
00:01:17.901 --> 00:01:19.460
ancient Elyria and language,

21
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.690
which itself was an Indo-European language with uncertain connections to other

22
00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:27.530
ones. But there are others who think it's related to Thracian or dation.

23
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.910
Albanian is spoken by around 7.6 million people,

24
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.490
mainly in the Balkin region of Southeastern Europe.

25
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.090
It's the official language of Albania as well as Kosovo,

26
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.320
along with Serbian in North Macedonia, alongside Macedonian.

27
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.150
And it's also official at the municipal level in six of Montenegro's 24

28
00:01:47.151 --> 00:01:51.500
municipalities. It's also spoken by minorities in other adjacent areas,

29
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.810
such as Serbia, Italy and Greece,

30
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.330
not much is known about the history of Albanian.

31
00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.470
And that's partly because the earliest examples of Albanian writing that we know

32
00:02:00.471 --> 00:02:01.970
of are relatively recent.

33
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.320
The earliest known example of Albanian writing is from 1462.

34
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.510
And the first Albanian book was written in 1555 efforts to standardize

35
00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:12.590
the literary language,

36
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.630
both in orthography and language forms only began in the early 20th century and

37
00:02:17.631 --> 00:02:21.770
the common standard wasn't accepted everywhere until the second half of the 20th

38
00:02:21.771 --> 00:02:24.860
century, as late as 1968 in Kosovo,

39
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.840
the standard that came to predominate was based on the task dialect though.

40
00:02:29.841 --> 00:02:32.630
It contains elements of the other major dialect as well.

41
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.490
Gig task and gig are roughly divided by the [inaudible] river

42
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.350
with varieties of task being spoken in Southern Albania, parts of Italy, Greece,

43
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.400
and Turkey, and the gig being spoken in Kosovo, Northern Albania,

44
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.490
the Republic of North Macedonia and Montenegro,

45
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.430
both dialects have a number of sub dialects,

46
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.400
and there is a transitional dialect in central Albania.

47
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.920
What's Albanian like let's look at some basic words and to start,

48
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.150
and since it's kind of hard to find Albanian speakers to help with this video,

49
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.330
I'm just going to use the Google translate voice. Let's check it out.

50
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.373
<v 1>Yes.</v>

51
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.340
<v 0>On second thought. I think I'll find a native speaker. Hello.</v>

52
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.530
Gimme notice that this letter is pronounced as Chuck. Good morning.

53
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.690
Yes. Good is Mia and morning is Jess.

54
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.190
This letter represents a Schwab sound and you'll see this a lot in Albanian,

55
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.690
but notice that it's reduced and almost not heard at the end of words, Mia,

56
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.980
and notice that this diagraph is pronounced as a palatal jaw,

57
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.900
similar to Jeff, except that the tongue is retracted towards the palette.

58
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.570
Joe is represented by the diagraph X H Albanian has a number of diagraphs

59
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.370
combinations of two letters that represent a single consonant sound good

60
00:03:53.371 --> 00:03:54.120
afternoon.

61
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.380
<v 1>Mudita Dita means day. Good evening.</v>

62
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.180
Member Ima [inaudible] means evening. And in Burma.

63
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.700
<v 0>[Inaudible] actually means last night,</v>

64
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.010
[inaudible] Bone voyage or have a nice trip.

65
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.890
<v 1>Broke Dunbar in the word meaner.</v>

66
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.640
<v 0>You heard an R sound, which was an alveolar or post alveolar,</v>

67
00:04:17.641 --> 00:04:21.330
approximate similar to the R sound in North American English.

68
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.900
That sound is written with a single R in the word rogue.

69
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.970
We can see that the double R represents a trill in Albanian called the police.

70
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.340
[inaudible] notice that Albanian has a thud sound represented by T H.

71
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:36.960
It also has a voice.

72
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.700
The sound represented by D H it's one of a small number of

73
00:04:41.701 --> 00:04:45.630
Indo-European languages that has those sounds go away.

74
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.810
Notice that the diagraph Z H represents the sound like the French J

75
00:04:51.811 --> 00:04:56.370
sound. What's your name? [inaudible] informal speech.

76
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.400
And [inaudible] in informal speech.

77
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.810
The letter Q represents the sound cha like jaw,

78
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.410
but with the tongue retracted towards the palate, my name.

79
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.850
<v 1>Is [inaudible].</v>

80
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.470
<v 0>Now let's examine a few features of the language. Now, in cases,</v>

81
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.540
there are five known cases in Albania. Nominative accusative, dative,

82
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.440
genitive, and ablative evocative case also exists,

83
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.430
but isn't very common nouns have endings that show the case of the note.

84
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.640
Those endings are also different for singular and plural,

85
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.300
as well as definite and indefinite. So the endings function,

86
00:05:33.301 --> 00:05:36.840
not only as case markers, but also as markers of definiteness,

87
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.090
the indefinite singular forms also have an indefinite article before the noun,

88
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.190
which also means one and the indefinite plural forms can also be proceeded by

89
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.450
DISA a word,

90
00:05:48.451 --> 00:05:53.130
meaning some the case declensions are different for masculine nouns and feminine

91
00:05:53.131 --> 00:05:56.970
nouns. And there are some variations within both masculine and feminine,

92
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.730
depending on the sound at the end of the word, adjectives,

93
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.880
adjectives come after the noun. For example,

94
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.430
meaning the good boy and [inaudible] meaning the good girl,

95
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.120
adjective endings don't change very much. They're usually the same,

96
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.040
except for the feminine plural form,

97
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.620
which ends in ah [inaudible]. But they are proceeded by linking articles, that 

98
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.620
show case

99
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.620
 gender number and definiteness it's worth noting that adjectives can be attributive meaning they come right after the 

100
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.620
noun

101
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.453
, or they can be predicative meaning they come after a linking verb in Albanian, in the plural definite form. The adjectives have different linking articles depending on whether the adjective is attributive or predicative for example, the good.

102
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.850
<v 2>Visa MENA and the girls are good vies at the end to me. Yeah.</v>

103
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.500
<v 0>Yeah. Notice here at the verb,</v>

104
00:06:50.501 --> 00:06:54.580
meaning to be a predicates of adjective comes after a linking verb,

105
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.670
whereas an attributive adjective comes right after the noun.

106
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.350
Verbs verbs are one of the most complex things about Albania,

107
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.710
because there are many moods that are used together with tenses.

108
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:10.330
Moods are verb forms that indicate the attitude of the speaker towards what is

109
00:07:10.331 --> 00:07:13.420
being said. There are six moods indicative,

110
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.200
which expresses a fact or asks a question subjunctive,

111
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:21.870
which show is possibility optative which expresses a wish Admiral,

112
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.660
which expresses surprise or disagreement, conditional,

113
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.670
which expresses something dependent on a condition and imperative used for

114
00:07:30.671 --> 00:07:32.080
commands or instructions.

115
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:37.300
The subjunctive and optative moods are closely related and both existed in prodo

116
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.511
window.

117
00:07:37.511 --> 00:07:42.250
European Albanian is the only modern Indo-European language that maintains both

118
00:07:42.251 --> 00:07:46.390
of them in parallel in other Indo-European languages. They either merged,

119
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:51.160
or one of them fell out of use. There are eight basic tenses in Albania,

120
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.070
which incorporate both tents and aspect together,

121
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:58.300
but not all of the tenses are used with each mood in the indicative mood.

122
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.760
There are eight tenses in the subjunctive mood.

123
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.460
There are four tenses in the admirals of mood,

124
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.080
four tenses in the optative mood, two tenses in the conditional mood,

125
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:12.880
two tenses and in the imperative mood, just one pronouns,

126
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:18.010
personal pronouns in Albania differ depending on case in the accusative and date

127
00:08:18.011 --> 00:08:22.630
of cases, the personal pronouns are accompanied by short forms. In other words,

128
00:08:22.631 --> 00:08:26.080
clinic pronouns that appear before the verb. For example.

129
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.910
<v 2>Meaning I.</v>

130
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:32.440
<v 0>Saw him at the, is an accusative pronoun for the third person singular,</v>

131
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.440
but it's accompanied by a clinic pronoun,

132
00:08:35.441 --> 00:08:38.710
which goes before the verb note that this sentence could also.

133
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.050
<v 2>Be since Albanian.</v>

134
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:45.610
<v 0>Is pro drop and the subject pronoun can be dropped because it's obvious from the</v>

135
00:08:45.611 --> 00:08:46.540
verb conjugation.

136
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:51.790
Oftentimes the full pronoun is left out and only the clinic pronoun is used.

137
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.380
So the sentence above could.

138
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.470
<v 2>Also be, or.</v>

139
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.850
<v 0>The short forms also appear together with nouns in the accusative and date of</v>

140
00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:04.110
cases. For example.

141
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:09.440
<v 2>And I followed the doctorate, meaning ever. I spoke to the doctor here, doctor.</v>

142
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.890
<v 0>Down in the date of case and the clinic pronoun.</v>

143
00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.770
He accompanies it appearing before the verb,

144
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.240
but they don't appear in every case when the object is in the date of case.

145
00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.250
In other words, an indirect object,

146
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:26.690
the clinic pronoun is required when the object is in the accusative case though,

147
00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:30.860
in other words, a direct object, the clinic pronoun is used in certain cases,

148
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:31.730
but not others.

149
00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:36.260
The basic rule is that the accusative clinic pronoun must be used when the

150
00:09:36.261 --> 00:09:38.090
accusative object. In other words,

151
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.530
the direct object is not the focus of the sentence while the clinic pronoun

152
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.520
can't be used. When the accusative object is the focus of the sentence.

153
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.473
For example.

154
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:51.440
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

155
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.250
<v 0>The sentences both mean ever bought the dress. But in the second sentence,</v>

156
00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.000
the focus is on the dress. For example, answering the question,

157
00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.470
which item did she buy?

158
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.340
So the clinic doesn't appear possessive adjectives.

159
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:08.270
There are also possessive adjectives in Albania, which follow the noun,

160
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.080
that's possessed and agree with it in case and gender. For example,

161
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.640
Bastian NNT meaning I saw his dog. This is the possessive adjective,

162
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:20.720
meaning his four nouns in the accusative case and this sentence.

163
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.940
<v 2>She needed DA's tissue to her, meaning his.</v>

164
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.370
<v 0>Dog is ugly. This also means his,</v>

165
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.700
but it's in the nominative case because the dog is the subject.

166
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.700
Also notice the different endings of the noun, meaning dog,

167
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.960
depending on its case, and notice the linking article before the adjective.

168
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:40.280
Also note that it's a predicative adjective and follows the linking verb.

169
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:44.000
It's the third person singular present form of the verb.

170
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:49.730
Meaning to be now let's focus on a couple more Albanian sentences and

171
00:10:49.731 --> 00:10:51.680
see what we find. Here's a sentence.

172
00:10:51.681 --> 00:10:55.040
Meaning the company president gave a promotion to his employees.

173
00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:58.880
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

174
00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.840
<v 0>Word for word it's.</v>

175
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:04.700
President company gave a raise in duty employee

176
00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.870
his in this sentence, we see several examples of noun cases.

177
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.230
So let's focus on those for a minute. First, look at the phrase,

178
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:13.730
busy Dan Deckland Bernice.

179
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.810
The first noun is the definite singular nominative form of Missy.

180
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.640
Then the second now is the indefinite singular genitive form of company.

181
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:27.050
The preposition E meaning of is part of the genitive form.

182
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:30.950
The case forms for these two nouns are different because of their gender.

183
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:34.820
They see den is masculine and company is feminine.

184
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:36.403
Here.

185
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.180
<v 2>Is the indefinite.</v>

186
00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:42.260
<v 0>Singular accusative form of the now, which is the same as the nominative form.</v>

187
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.460
This now is in the accusative case because it's the direct object of the verb.

188
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.450
Indefinite singular nouns are proceeded by an indefinite article,

189
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.610
which also means one it's followed by the preposition.

190
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:59.200
No meaning in then by the noun, the dura meaning duty.

191
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.160
This now is in the indefinite singular accusative form because of the

192
00:12:03.161 --> 00:12:06.190
preposition that comes before it next,

193
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.370
the [inaudible] is the definite third person,

194
00:12:09.371 --> 00:12:14.260
singular data form of the masculine noun who knowing yours it's data

195
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:17.290
because the employee is the indirect object of the verb.

196
00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:21.880
And he is the clinic pronoun accompanying the date of now

197
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.230
it's worth pointing out that the word order in Albanian is flexible.

198
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.110
It would be perfectly fine to say this sentence this way. Instead.

199
00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:34.110
<v 2>Residential companies [inaudible] new ingredient or the dura.</v>

200
00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.030
<v 0>Another sentence. This sentence means we want to buy some souvenirs.</v>

201
00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:41.460
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

202
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.420
<v 0>Word for word it.</v>

203
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:47.100
We want subjunctive particle by some souvenirs.

204
00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:50.850
First we see that the nominative personal pronoun. Yeah.

205
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.010
Which means we can be dropped.

206
00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:58.380
Doula is the first person plural present indicative form of the verb. Doula,

207
00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:03.090
meaning want in English. The verb want is followed by the infinitive of a verb,

208
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:07.500
but Albanian has no infinitive form. The subjunctive form is used instead.

209
00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.900
This is the subjunctive form of the verb.

210
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.100
BA meaning to buy is the subjunctive particle,

211
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:18.090
which proceeds the subjunctive form of the verb. For most subjects.

212
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.670
The subjunctive form is the same as the indicative,

213
00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:24.420
except for the second person and third person singular, which are different.

214
00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:29.220
The subjunctive is used after other modal verbs as well. Like do hurt,

215
00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:33.420
meaning must and mooned. Meaning can finally,

216
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:38.070
the word souvenir is the plural indefinite accusative form of the nouns.

217
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:43.020
Linear Albanian is a fascinating language with some unique

218
00:13:43.021 --> 00:13:46.290
features that make it stand out from other Indo-European languages.

219
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.130
And it also has some other features in common with other languages of the

220
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.500
Balkins because of the Balkin Sprott Puente,

221
00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:56.580
an area in which all of the different languages of the Balkins influence each

222
00:13:56.581 --> 00:13:58.800
other through contact in this video,

223
00:13:58.801 --> 00:14:01.440
we've basically just scratched the surface of Albanian,

224
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:05.370
especially with regards to its rich verbal system of tenses and moods.

225
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.010
But if Albanian captures your imagination,

226
00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.290
then you might want to check out these two courses,

227
00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:15.420
colloquial Albanian the complete course for beginners and discovering Albanian.

228
00:14:15.421 --> 00:14:16.200
One,

229
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:20.670
both courses are by Linda Monico and Hector Campos colloquial

230
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:25.050
Albanian seems more accessible to the casual learner while discovering Albanian.

231
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.540
It seems more thorough and made for serious learners.

232
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:30.870
The question of the day for native speakers of Albania,

233
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.960
do you speak a task dialect or a gig dialect?

234
00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:37.260
How different are they and how well do you understand the other group of

235
00:14:37.261 --> 00:14:40.800
dialects and for everyone else, what's your impression of Albania.
