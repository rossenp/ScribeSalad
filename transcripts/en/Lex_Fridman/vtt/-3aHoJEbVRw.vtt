WEBVTT

1
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.640
<v 0>But, uh, can we talk about, uh,</v>

2
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.800
darkness a little bit? So yeah. Yeah. Tech Kazinski,

3
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.200
the Unal was allegedly part of the MK ultra studies while at Harvard.

4
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.440
Uh, do you think this is true?

5
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.000
Do you think had an impact on him psychologically, intellectually?

6
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.030
<v 1>I, so I do think it's true and I do think I, it had an impact. So, um,</v>

7
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.790
we talked before about, are these drugs somehow or other, um,

8
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.630
producing a certain kind of drug experience or do they bring out what's within

9
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.430
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so we have this experience yeah. On the one hand, Ken Kei,

10
00:00:40.431 --> 00:00:44.940
and he sort of took positive things out of this. Uh, on the other hand, um,

11
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.140
you know, we can, um, get this, uh, opposition to the modern world,

12
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.500
to technology and to the point of, uh,

13
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.580
creating bombs to try to go after it so that the experience is not in the drug,

14
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.020
it's this interaction between, um, the drug, the person, the context.

15
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.090
And so we can heal people with, um,

16
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.410
psychedelics or people can be driven crazy with psychedelics. Um, it,

17
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.810
it depends again on the context. And so I think it's both,

18
00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:18.810
these things can be true.

19
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.690
And I think it was really good that you kind of highlighted this,

20
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.490
that there is this, um,

21
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.680
polar and that it's not in the drug it's in the,

22
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.720
the other factors and it's who they were beforehand.

23
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.760
And then how you use that experience.

24
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.400
So all that's to say is if we put LSD in the water and everybody we're gonna get

25
00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:40.160
it, it doesn't mean that all of a sudden everybody's gonna have a mystical

26
00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:42.280
experience. And then that's, you know,

27
00:01:42.281 --> 00:01:44.720
all we need to do and humanity is spiritualized and,

28
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.830
and war and all of this it's, it's not about the drug.

29
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.150
<v 2>Uh, that, that actually is why for me, um, we've also talked about, um,</v>

30
00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.871
engineering,

31
00:01:55.871 --> 00:01:59.110
new psychedelics and all the people that are gonna be trying for-profit

32
00:01:59.111 --> 00:02:02.110
companies to develop and patent new psychedelics. For me,

33
00:02:02.111 --> 00:02:06.140
the most important challenge is new cultural Xs

34
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.980
that can create legality safety support for the

35
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.020
existing psychedelics that we already have.

36
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.980
<v 1>Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, I mean,</v>

37
00:02:14.981 --> 00:02:19.420
we have so much incredible tools in these existing

38
00:02:19.421 --> 00:02:24.420
psychedelics that it's more about creating context for them to be used in

39
00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:28.450
safe medical or personal oath or recreational, even with harm reduction,

40
00:02:28.451 --> 00:02:29.091
all these different ways.

41
00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:32.930
That's more important to me than finding some new molecule that's somewhat

42
00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:35.770
similar or somewhat different, but, you know, it can be patented.

43
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.010
So it's the social context. So I, I do believe that, uh,

44
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.410
Ted Kazinski was part of NK ultra,

45
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.000
and I think it affected him in a negative way. And that's, uh,

46
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.760
cautionary tale that it's not in the drug it's in the context.

47
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.240
<v 0>The context, the person still, it feels like, um,</v>

48
00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.840
if viewed from a therapy perspective,

49
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.040
perhaps there was a way to use psychedelics to help Ted Kansky find

50
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.320
a path out of the darkness.

51
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.040
<v 1>I, I think so. And I think that, um,</v>

52
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.640
this is where I think M DMA comes in in a way that M D M a is, um,

53
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.510
you know, he felt very isolated and very much, um,

54
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.230
out of society in some ways, um, MDMA, um,

55
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.990
stimulates oxytocin, which we haven't mentioned,

56
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:29.510
which is the hormone of nursing mothers of love and connection. It,

57
00:03:29.511 --> 00:03:33.470
it provides a lot of this sense of self acceptance and safety and,

58
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.350
and wanting to be in relationship. There's go,

59
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.540
Dolan is a neuroscientist at Hopkins. She's get even octopuses M DMA,

60
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.660
they're solitary creatures except mating season, which is not very often. And,

61
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:49.820
but you give them MDMA and they become more interested in hanging out with other

62
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.893
octopuses mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

63
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.060
<v 2>So I think this, um, for people that have had difficult psychedelic experiences,</v>

64
00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.650
um, MDMA helps them integrate them. We've with people that had, uh,

65
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.650
a difficult LSD experience 40 years before mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and are still

66
00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:08.490
able to get back to that under the influence of MDMA and work out some of the

67
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.100
conflicts that they weren't able to resolve all those decades

68
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.233
before.

69
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.700
<v 1>So I,</v>

70
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.220
I think that psychedelics could have been helpful in a different context for 10

71
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:21.550
kaing,

72
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:26.170
but the other big part of it is that people have to be willing to

73
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.170
cooperate with the experience. We talked about resistance,

74
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.890
so people can resist these things. It's, uh, you know,

75
00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:35.170
the saying is you can drink, bring, bring a horse to water,

76
00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:36.410
but you can't make 'em drink. Yeah.

77
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.130
This is about how people have to be willing to go to these spaces.

78
00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.730
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

79
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.520
So one of the essence of our therapeutic approach is that we help people

80
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.600
to heal themselves, that we are not giving them the healing. It's,

81
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.720
it's, it's a flip on the power dynamics that existed. Um,

82
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.920
you would say in the fifties and sixties,

83
00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:59.720
my dad was a doctor and the doctors were gods and, you know,

84
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.510
whatever they said was right. And, you know, we,

85
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.870
we no longer of course believe that, but, um, for a while,

86
00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:07.990
psychoanalysis with Freud, you know,

87
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.590
that they gave the interpretation to the patient,

88
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:11.870
the patient couldn't help themselves,

89
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.550
but they would do the free associations and the psychos would see these

90
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:16.480
conflicts and would,

91
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.550
would be the one that does the healing would give this interpretation and that

92
00:05:20.551 --> 00:05:22.620
would opens things up. So I,

93
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.780
I think it's this idea of empowering people to heal themselves.

94
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.340
And so if Ted Kazuki had been in a therapeutic setting with psychedelics,

95
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.860
and if they'd had something like MDMA available or

96
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.060
MDA, which was popular during the sixties,

97
00:05:39.061 --> 00:05:42.730
which is a more like MDMA LSD combination &lt;affirmative&gt;, um,

98
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.610
the outcomes might have been different.
