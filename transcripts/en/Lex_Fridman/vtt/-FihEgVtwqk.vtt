00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.510
<v 0>Uh, can I ask you, uh, in terms of, um, you know,</v>

2
00:00:06.511 --> 00:00:11.190
the deep state and conspiracy theories, there's a lot of talk about, so again,

3
00:00:11.191 --> 00:00:14.590
from an outsider's perspective, if I were just looking at Twitter,

4
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.910
it seems that at least 90% of people in government are pedophiles.

5
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.950
&lt;laugh&gt; that 90, 90, 90 5%. I'm not sure what that number,

6
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.660
but if I were to just look at Twitter, honestly, or YouTube,

7
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.580
I would think most of the world is a pedophile. I would almost be like.

8
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.300
<v 1>Right. And if you don't fully believe that you're a pedophile &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.</v>

9
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.820
<v 0>Yeah. I'll start to wonder like, wait, am I like, what am I a pedophile too?</v>

10
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.130
Like I'm either communist or a pedophile or both, I guess. Yeah.

11
00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:46.530
That's gonna be clipped out. Thank you, internet. &lt;laugh&gt;

12
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.850
I look forward to your emails. Uh,

13
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.050
but is there any kind of shadow conspiracy

14
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.970
theories that, uh, give you pause or, um,

15
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.080
so the flip side, the response to a lot of conspiracy theories, it's like, no,

16
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.040
the reason this happened is because it's a combination of just incompetence.

17
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.080
So where do you land on some of these, uh, conspiracy theories?

18
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.080
<v 1>I think most conspiracy theories are wrong. Some are true,</v>

19
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.880
and those are spectacularly true. And if that makes sense. Yeah. Um,

20
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.550
I, and we don't know which ones.

21
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.510
<v 0>Though. I don't know which ones.</v>

22
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.110
<v 1>That's the problem. I think O well, I mean, look, man,</v>

23
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.983
I listened to your podcast.

24
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.510
I think I was a huge nonbeliever in UFOs and now I've probably

25
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.710
never believed more in U like, I, I, I believe in UFOs. Yeah.

26
00:01:39.711 --> 00:01:42.950
Like I'm very comfortable being like, not only do I believe in UFOs,

27
00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:46.100
like I think we're probably being visited by an alien civilization. Like,

28
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.860
and if you asked me that three years ago, I would've been like,

29
00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:51.300
you're outta your mind. Like, what are you talking about? Well,

30
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.100
listen to David Frager. That's all I have to say. That's it?

31
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.940
<v 0>Well, I, I have the sense that the government has information hasn't revealed,</v>

32
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.940
but it's not like they're, I don't think they're holding. There's like a,

33
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.850
a green guy sitting there in a room. Exactly. They just, they have seen things.

34
00:02:06.851 --> 00:02:10.530
They don't know what to do with, so it's like, they're confused. Like they're.

35
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.930
<v 1>Afraid. Yeah. Of, of revealing that they don't know. That's what I think.</v>

36
00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:14.764
It's right.

37
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.370
<v 0>It's revealing the, yeah, exactly. They don't know. And then in the process,</v>

38
00:02:19.371 --> 00:02:23.170
there's a lot of fears tied up in that first looking incompetent in the public

39
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.480
eye. Nobody wants to be, uh, looked at way.

40
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.400
And the other is like in revealing it, even though they don't know,

41
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.600
maybe China will figure it out. Exactly. &lt;laugh&gt; so, like,

42
00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:35.160
we don't want China to figure it out first.

43
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.480
And so that all those kinds of things result in basically secrecy,

44
00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:43.640
then that damages the trust and institutions on one of the most fascinating

45
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.143
aspects.

46
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.750
Like one of the most fascinating mysteries of humankind of is their

47
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.430
life intelligent life out there in the universe. So that's one of them,

48
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.470
but there there's other ones like, uh, for me, when I first came across,

49
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.440
actually Alex Jones mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; was, uh, nine 11. Yeah.

50
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.400
I remember like, uh, cause I was, um, I was in Chicago. I was thinking like,

51
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.200
oh, are they gonna hit Chicago too? &lt;laugh&gt; that's what everybody was thinking.

52
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:14.400
Yeah. Everybody, everybody was thinking like, what does this mean at what scale?

53
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.440
What? I mean, trying to interpret it. And I remember like looking for,

54
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.790
for information desperate, like what, what happened? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; what,

55
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.190
and I remember not being satisfied with the quality of reporting and

56
00:03:26.191 --> 00:03:29.830
figuring out like rigorous, like here's exactly what happened.

57
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.030
And so people like Alex Jones stepped up and others that said like,

58
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.260
there's some shady going on and it sure as hell looked like there's shady it

59
00:03:39.261 --> 00:03:41.580
going on. Yes. Uh, so like,

60
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.780
and I still stand behind the fact that it seems like there's not,

61
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.580
I there's not enough in like,

62
00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:50.740
it wasn't good job of being honest and transparent and all those kinds of

63
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:51.700
things. Well, cause it would implicate.

64
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.940
<v 1>The Saudis. Let's be honest. Right. See that's that's my conspiracy theories.</v>

65
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.460
I'm like, yeah.

66
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.540
I think they covered up a lot of stuff because they wanted to cover up for the

67
00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:01.090
kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Like, and then, I mean, that is a,

68
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:04.330
that was a conspiracy theory. Not that long ago. I think it's true. I,

69
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.850
you never think it's a hundred percent true.
