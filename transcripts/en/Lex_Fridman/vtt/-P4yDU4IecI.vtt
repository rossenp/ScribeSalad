00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.220
<v 0>What is the most beautiful idea you've learned about artificial intelligence,</v>

2
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.820
knowledge, reasoning from, uh, working on psych for 37 years,

3
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.900
or maybe what is the most beautiful idea,

4
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.900
surprising idea about psych to you?

5
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.610
When I look up at the stars, I kind of like that, that amazement,

6
00:00:24.611 --> 00:00:27.170
you feel that, wow,

7
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.810
and you are part of creating one of the greatest,

8
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.850
one of the most fascinating efforts in artificial intelligence history.

9
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.010
So which element brings you personally joy?

10
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.120
<v 1>This may sound contradictory, but I, I think it it's</v>

11
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.800
the feeling that

12
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.790
this will be the only time in history that anyone ever has to

13
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.990
teach a computer. This particular thing that we're now teaching it,

14
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.350
it's, it's like painting star night.

15
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.820
You, you only have to do that once or creating the PA tie.

16
00:01:07.821 --> 00:01:11.820
You only have to do that once. You know, it's not, it's not like a,

17
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.020
it's not like a singer who has to keep, you know,

18
00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:16.820
it's not like Bruce Springsteen having to,

19
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.100
to sing his greatest hits over and over again, a different concerts.

20
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.970
It's more like a painter create creating a work of art

21
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.770
once, and then that's enough. It doesn't have to be created again.

22
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.650
And so I really get the sense of,

23
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.010
we are telling the system things that it's useful for it to know.

24
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.730
It's useful for a computer to know for an AI to know.

25
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.960
And if we do our jobs right, when we do our right,

26
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.680
no one will ever have to do this again for this particular piece of knowledge.

27
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.320
It's very, very exciting.

28
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.560
<v 0>Yeah. I guess there's a sadness to it too. It's like, uh,</v>

29
00:01:57.561 --> 00:02:01.680
there's a magic to being a parent and raising a child and teaching them all

30
00:02:01.681 --> 00:02:06.310
about this world. But you know, there's billions of children, right?

31
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.230
Like born or whatev, whatever that number is. It's a large number,

32
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.870
number of children.

33
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.030
And a lot of parents get to experience that joy of teaching and &lt;laugh&gt; with AI

34
00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:19.310
systems, you know, uh,

35
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.430
they at least the current constructions, they remember &lt;laugh&gt; you don't,

36
00:02:24.431 --> 00:02:27.220
you don't get to experience the joy oft um,

37
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.900
a machine millions of times better.

38
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.340
<v 1>Come work for us before it's too late then. Exactly.</v>

39
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.300
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt;, that's a good, &lt;laugh&gt;, that's a good hiring pitch. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; um,</v>

40
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.220
yeah, it is true. But then there's also, you know,

41
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.580
it's a project that continues forever in some sense, just like Wikipedia. Yes.

42
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.690
You get to a stable base of knowledge, but knowledge grows,

43
00:02:49.691 --> 00:02:53.730
knowledge evolves. We, we learn as a hu um,

44
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.770
you know, as a human species, as science,

45
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.600
as an organism constantly grows and evolves and

46
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.240
changes, and then empowered that with the tools of artificial intelligence.

47
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.840
And that's going to keep growing and growing and growing. And many of the,

48
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.760
the assertions that you helped previously, uh,

49
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.670
may need to be significantly expand, modified all those kinds of things.

50
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.670
So it could be like a living organism versus, uh,

51
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.510
the analogy I think we started this conversation with,

52
00:03:26.511 --> 00:03:28.030
which is like this solid ground.

53
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:30.463
<v 1>The, the other</v>

54
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.910
beautiful experience that we have with our system is when it

55
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.710
asks clarifying questions,

56
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.140
which inadvertently turned out to be emotional

57
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.140
to us Uhhuh &lt;affirmative&gt;. So at one point it knew that

58
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.220
these were the named entities who were authorized to make

59
00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.380
changes to the knowledge base and so on.

60
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.570
And it noticed that all of them were people except for it,

61
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.250
because it was also allowed to. And so it said, you know, am I a person?

62
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.410
And we had to like, tell it very sadly, no,

63
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.810
you're not. So the moments like that,

64
00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:18.810
where it asks questions that are unintentionally poignant, uh, are, uh, are,

65
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.320
are worth treasuring. That.

66
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.760
<v 0>Is powerful.</v>
