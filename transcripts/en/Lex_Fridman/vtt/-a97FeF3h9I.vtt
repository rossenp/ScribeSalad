00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.750
<v 0>I saw you, uh, throw your hat into the ring of fater. Yes.</v>

2
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.510
<v 1>He got COVID I guess I hope he,</v>

3
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.670
I hope he overcomes it and comes out just as good, if not better.

4
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.533
Epic would that.

5
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.350
<v 0>Did I understand correctly that that might be his last fight?</v>

6
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.710
<v 1>Yes, that's my understanding.</v>

7
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.300
And it would be epic as hell and it would be epic as hell because &lt;affirmative&gt;

8
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.980
the, the person that I want to give my most to is a person that I respect,

9
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.940
especially at this, this long, uh, this long, this, this,

10
00:00:32.941 --> 00:00:36.500
this long career of mine and getting at this, this, this in his years,

11
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.300
like two warriors. And, and,

12
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.020
and that's the thing about even this going in there with the aspect of being

13
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.770
with death and all that is the it, when that person is in there, there,

14
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.850
and my brother with me in this and that.

15
00:00:48.851 --> 00:00:53.490
<v 2>So when you give me your best, even if I, even if I win dominant fashion,</v>

16
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.530
but if you show up a and you're as authentic and, and being here as I am, then,

17
00:00:57.531 --> 00:01:00.570
then I love you. And I'm glad for you to be here and we're in this together.

18
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.450
And, and at this point, you know,

19
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.000
you loss or my loss or whatever is no less

20
00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:11.280
deserving of veneration than the win. Like we're here in this.

21
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.160
And so to be in the ring with fielder and to venerate him in win or

22
00:01:16.161 --> 00:01:20.880
defeat to be in there with, with someone, uh, like that is,

23
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.430
to me, it's so rare. So.

24
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.670
<v 0>It's incredible how the ultimate violence is coupled with</v>

25
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.510
like, love or respect. And it's like, it is weird how this is,

26
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:36.650
uh,

27
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.270
how the competition and is violent form is also

28
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.540
a, uh, veneration of human connection.

29
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.620
<v 1>It's also the removal. I feel like it's the purest, honest, the purest ways,</v>

30
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.300
purest, honest, most honest places, a prison can exist, uh,

31
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.740
that line and fight club.

32
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:57.900
You don't know really who you are until you've been in a fight. I mean,

33
00:01:57.901 --> 00:01:58.734
believe that.

34
00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.953
<v 2>And, uh,</v>

35
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.300
I've seen so many examples of people trying to portray themselves as one thing.

36
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.890
And then in the ring, you see who they really are,

37
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.250
or even when they're trying to persuade themselves as one thing,

38
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.530
and they're winning the crowd at times will see who they really

39
00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:19.090
are and still hate them. &lt;laugh&gt; you know? Yeah. And it's like,

40
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.130
but I said all the good things. Yeah, bro, don't work that way.
