1
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.940
<v 0>Can physics help us understand life.</v>

2
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.250
So, uh,

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.780
we spoke so confidently about the laws of physics,

4
00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.610
being able to explain reality, but,

5
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.180
and we even said was like theory of everything,

6
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.020
implying that the word everything is actually describing everything.

7
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.270
Is it possible that the four laws we've been talking about are

8
00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:33.440
actually missing, they are accurate in describing what they're describing,

9
00:00:33.441 --> 00:00:38.300
but they're missing the description of a lot of other things like emergence

10
00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:42.980
of life, uh, and emergence of perhaps consciousness.

11
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.780
So is there,

12
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.640
do you ever think about this kind of stuff where we would need to

13
00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:54.470
understand extra physics to try to explain

14
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.960
the emergence of these complex pockets of

15
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.561
interesting,

16
00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:05.060
weird stuff that we call life and consciousness in this big

17
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.840
homogeneous universe that's mostly boring and nothing is happening.

18
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.033
<v 1>First of all,</v>

19
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.600
we don't claim that string theory is the theory of everything in a sense that we

20
00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:16.220
know enough what this theory is.

21
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.590
We don't know enough about string theory itself. We are learning it.

22
00:01:18.591 --> 00:01:20.000
So I wouldn't say, okay,

23
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:23.600
give me whatever I will tell you whether it's hard to work. No. However,

24
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.890
I would say by definition, by definition to me, physics is checking all reality,

25
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.360
any form of reality, I call it physics. That's my definition. I mean,

26
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.500
I may not know a lot of it, like maybe the origin of life and so on.

27
00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:39.950
Maybe a piece of that, but I will call that as part of physics. To me,

28
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.210
reality is what we're after I don't claim, I know everything about reality.

29
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.290
I don't claim string theory necessarily has the tools right now to describe all

30
00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:50.990
the reality either, but we are learning what it is.

31
00:01:50.991 --> 00:01:53.960
So I would say that I would not put a border to say, no, you know,

32
00:01:53.961 --> 00:01:56.510
from this point onwards, it's not my territory, it's somebody else's.

33
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.710
But whether we need new ideas in string theory to describe other reality,

34
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.200
reality features, for sure, I believe as I mentioned,

35
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.710
I don't believe anythings any of the laws we know today is final.

36
00:02:06.711 --> 00:02:09.410
So therefore yes, we will need new ideas.

37
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.080
<v 0>Very tricky thing for us to understand</v>

38
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.950
and be precise about.

39
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.990
But just because you understand the physics

40
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.820
doesn't necessarily mean that you understand the

41
00:02:25.821 --> 00:02:30.110
emergence of chemistry, biology, life,

42
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.980
intelligence consciousness. So those are built.

43
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.600
It's like a, you might understand the way bricks work,

44
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.070
but to understand what it means to have a happy family,

45
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.210
you don't construct, you don't get from the bricks.

46
00:02:46.211 --> 00:02:50.870
So the directly you write a theory, you could, uh,

47
00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:52.940
if you ran the universe over again,

48
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.680
but just understanding the rules of the universe doesn't necessarily give you a

49
00:02:57.681 --> 00:03:00.880
sense of the beautiful things that emerge.

50
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.840
<v 1>No. So let me describe what you just said. There are two questions.</v>

51
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:07.300
One is whether or not the techniques I use in,

52
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:10.960
let's say quantum field theory and so on. Will describe how the society works.

53
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.750
Yes. Okay. This is far distance, far,

54
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.530
four different scales of questions that we're asking here. The question is,

55
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.000
is there a change of,

56
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.010
is it a new law which takes over that cannot be connected to the older laws

57
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.710
that we know or more fundamental laws that we know?

58
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.310
Do you need new laws to describe?

59
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.600
I don't think that's necessarily the case in many of these phenomena,

60
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.770
like chemistry or so on. You mentioned. So we do expect, you know, in principle,

61
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:38.200
chemistry can be described by quantum mechanics.

62
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.240
We don't think there's going to be a magical thing,

63
00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:44.230
but chemistry is complicated. Yeah. These are rules of chemistry that, you know,

64
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:47.620
chemists are put down, which has not been explained yet using quantum mechanics.

65
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.040
Do I believe that they will be a, something described by quantum mechanics? Yes,

66
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:54.370
I do. I don't think they are going to be sitting there in the shows forever,

67
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:56.710
but maybe it's too complicated then maybe, you know,

68
00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:59.950
we will wait for a very powerful quantum computers or whatnot to solve those

69
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:03.400
problems. I don't know, but I don't think in that context,

70
00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:07.570
we have no principles to be added to fix those. So by, by, by,

71
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.950
I'm perfectly fine in the intermediate situation to have rules of thumb or

72
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.260
principles that chemists have found, which already working,

73
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.800
which are not founded on the basis of quantum mechanical laws,

74
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.570
which does the job similarly,

75
00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:23.470
as biologists do not found everything in terms of chemistry, but they think,

76
00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:25.390
you know, there's no reason why chemistry cannot.

77
00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:28.600
They don't think necessarily they're doing something amazingly not possible with

78
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:32.590
chemistry coming back to your question, does consciousness, for example,

79
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.880
bring this new ingredient. If indeed it needs a new ingredient.

80
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.160
I will call that new ingredients part of physical law.

81
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.390
We have to understand it to me that so I wouldn't put a line to say, okay,

82
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.970
from this point onwards, you cannot, it's disconnected.

83
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.730
It's fully disconnected from string theory,

84
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.630
whatever we have to do something else.

85
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.860
<v 0>Line.</v>

86
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.390
What I'm referring to is can physics of a few centuries from now that doesn't

87
00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:59.590
understand cautiousness be much bigger than the physics of today

88
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.260
where the, the textbook grows.

89
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.050
<v 1>It definitely will. I would say I would not.</v>

90
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.170
I don't know if it grows because of consciousness being part of it,

91
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:09.640
or we have different view of conscience.

92
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.100
I do not know where the consciousness will fit. I'm not,

93
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.510
it's going to be hard for me to, to, to, to guess. I mean,

94
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.060
I can make random guesses now, which probably most right.

95
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.630
Most likely it's wrong, but let me just do just for the sake of discussion,

96
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.440
you know, I could say, you know, you know,

97
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.580
brain could be their quantum computer, classical computer,

98
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.400
their arguments against this being a quantum thing. So it's probably classical.

99
00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:31.270
And if it's classical,

100
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.240
it could be like what we are doing in machine learning slightly more fancy and

101
00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:37.150
so on. Okay. People can go to this argument to know, and,

102
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.220
and to some where they're cautious things, this is our life.

103
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.470
Does it have any meaning or is there,

104
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.270
is there a phase transition where you can say,

105
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.190
does electron have a life or not the,

106
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.440
at what level does the particle become life?

107
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.580
Maybe there's no definite definition of life in that same way that, you know,

108
00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:54.900
we cannot say electronic, if you, you know, a good,

109
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.470
I like this example quite a bit. Um, you know,

110
00:05:57.471 --> 00:06:01.130
we distinguish between liquid and a gas phase, like water is liquid or,

111
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.190
or vapors gas. And we say, there are different. You can distinguish them.

112
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.300
Actually. That's not true.

113
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.160
It's not true because we know from physics that you can change temperatures and

114
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.820
pressure to go from liquid to the gas without making any face transition.

115
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.110
So there is no point that you can say this was a liquid and this was a gas.

116
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.770
You can continuously change the parameters to go from one to the other.

117
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.860
So at the end, it's three different looking like, you know,

118
00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:27.170
I know that water is different from vapor, but you know,

119
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.120
there is no precise point. This happens.

120
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.520
I feel many of these things that we think like consciousness clearly dead person

121
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:35.360
is not conscious on.

122
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:38.090
The other one is so there's a difference like water and vapor,

123
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.420
but there's no point you could say that this is conscious.

124
00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:42.740
There's no sharp transition.

125
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.570
So it could very well be that what we call heuristically in daily

126
00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:51.050
life consciousness is similar. Life is similar to that.

127
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.980
I don't know if it's like that or not. I'm just hypothesizing as possible.

128
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.203
Like there's no.

129
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.100
<v 0>There's not discrete phases. There's.</v>

130
00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.600
<v 1>No phase transition like that.</v>

131
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.860
<v 0>But this, you might, there might be, you know,</v>

132
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.880
concepts of temperature and pressure that we need to understand, uh,

133
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.600
to describe what the high consciousness in life is that,

134
00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:15.800
that we're totally missing. You think that's not a useless question.

135
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:20.030
Even those questions that is back to our original discussion of philosophy,

136
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.540
I would say consciousness and free will, for example,

137
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.880
are topics that are very much so in the realm of philosophy

138
00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:31.370
currently, I don't think they will always be.

139
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.220
<v 1>I agree with, I agree with you. And I think I am,</v>

140
00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:38.030
I'm fine with some topics being part of a different realm than physics today

141
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:42.260
because we don't have the right tools, just like biology was. I mean,

142
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.220
before we had DNA and all that genetics and other gradually began to take hold.

143
00:07:46.221 --> 00:07:50.690
I mean, at the, when Mandela, when people were beginning with face experiments,

144
00:07:50.691 --> 00:07:54.050
with biology and chemistry and some big gradually they came together.

145
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.290
So it wasn't like together. So yeah,

146
00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.750
I'll be perfectly understanding of a situation where we don't have the tools.

147
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.560
So do the experiments that you think as is defined the conscious in different

148
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.260
format gradually we will build it and connect it. And yes,

149
00:08:06.261 --> 00:08:10.160
we might discover new principles of nature that we didn't know. I don't know,

150
00:08:10.161 --> 00:08:13.280
but I would say that if they are, they will be deeply connected with yes,

151
00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:15.320
we don't. We, we have never, we have seen in physics,

152
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:19.280
we don't have things in isolation. You cannot, you cannot compartmentalize,

153
00:08:19.281 --> 00:08:22.400
you know, this is gravity, this is electricity. This is that we have learned.

154
00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:26.150
They all talk to each other. There's no way to make them, you know,

155
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:29.090
in one corner and don't talk so same thing with anything,

156
00:08:29.091 --> 00:08:31.010
anything which is real. So consciousness is real.

157
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:34.490
So therefore we have to connect it to everything else. So to me,

158
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.500
once you connect it, you cannot say it's not reality.

159
00:08:36.501 --> 00:08:39.270
And it wants its reality is physics is I call it physics.

160
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:41.840
It's may not be the physics I know today for sure. It's not, but,

161
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.390
but I wouldn't. I would,

162
00:08:43.391 --> 00:08:46.850
I would be surprised if there's disconnected realities that you cannot,

163
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.460
you cannot imagine them as part of the same soup.

164
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:54.320
<v 0>So I guess a God doesn't have a biology, chemistry textbook and mostly,</v>
