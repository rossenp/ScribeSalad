00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.290
<v 0>Another non philosopher that may be considered a</v>

2
00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:11.850
philosopher since we're talking about reality is iron Rand and hor

3
00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:13.440
philosophy of objectivism.

4
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.470
What are your thoughts on her sense of taking this

5
00:00:19.471 --> 00:00:22.980
idea of reality, calling her philosophy, objectivism,

6
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.350
and a kind of starting at the idea that you really

7
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:32.430
could know everything and it's pretty obvious.

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.590
And then from that you can derive an ethics about how to live life.

9
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.120
Like what is the,

10
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.440
what is the good ethical life and all the virtue of selfishness,

11
00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:48.060
all that kind of stuff. Uh, so you talked a lot of academic philosophers,

12
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:50.970
so I'd be curious to see from the perspective of like,

13
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.970
is she somebody that's, uh, taken seriously at all?

14
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.610
Uh, why she dismissed as I see from my distant perspective,

15
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.350
by serious philosophers and also like your own personal thoughts of like,

16
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:12.320
is there some interesting bits that you find inspiring in her work or?

17
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.350
<v 1>Okay, so I N Rand, um,</v>

18
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.790
I've had so many exceedingly intelligent

19
00:01:19.791 --> 00:01:24.350
students basically give me her books

20
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.410
and basically say, please Dr. Basilica,

21
00:01:27.411 --> 00:01:31.130
read this book and I'll tell them, yes, thank you.

22
00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:34.130
I've read this book before and then why don't we engage in, you know,

23
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.260
let me put it this way. They're religious about iron rant. Okay. So to them,

24
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.820
Iran represents some type of way of life, right?

25
00:01:43.821 --> 00:01:46.070
Her objectivism. Um,

26
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.630
now why is she not taken seriously by philosophers in general?

27
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.240
Well, let me put it this way. Um,

28
00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:57.050
philosophers in general tend to get pretty,

29
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.630
I guess you could call it they're they're so kind of scientists,

30
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.210
but with words, I always called philosophy.

31
00:02:05.211 --> 00:02:07.910
When I describe it to someone who's going to take a philosophy class.

32
00:02:07.911 --> 00:02:12.680
I say it's basically math problems, like word math problems.

33
00:02:12.681 --> 00:02:14.570
Okay. So that's basically what it is.

34
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.510
<v 0>So they take words very seriously and they're very formal.</v>

35
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.810
<v 1>And definitions very seriously. Yeah. So they all want to get on the same page.</v>

36
00:02:20.811 --> 00:02:22.640
So they're not, so there is no confusion.

37
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.720
So for Iran to basically say you can know everything and, you know,

38
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.610
and establish ethics from that. I think philosophers automatically say no.

39
00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:35.780
Now that doesn't mean, I say no. Um, in fact, uh, we even,

40
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.900
we have at my university, a wonderful business school.

41
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.060
And when you walk into the, uh, Dean of the business school's office,

42
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.700
fine, Rand is everywhere. So it's,

43
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.700
so I want to say that not all academics are anti fine Rand. Um,

44
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.571
and in fact,

45
00:02:53.571 --> 00:02:57.800
I don't think philosophers are either except that they don't teach [inaudible]

46
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.800
. Okay. So in one sense, you could say that because they don't teach her they're

47
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.633
 being exclusive in what they teach or very particular perhaps is another way to put it.

48
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.180
<v 0>Yeah. It's hard to know where to place people like her because, um, you know,</v>

49
00:03:12.181 --> 00:03:14.790
do you put Albert Como as a philosopher?

50
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.770
So I guess what's the good term for that,

51
00:03:16.771 --> 00:03:21.000
like literary philosophers or whatever the term is.

52
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.590
It's annoying to me that the academic philosophers get to own the word

53
00:03:25.591 --> 00:03:27.030
philosophy. Cause like,

54
00:03:27.031 --> 00:03:30.630
it's just like people who think deeply about life is quote.

55
00:03:30.631 --> 00:03:34.920
I think about his philosophy. And like, to me, it's like, all right,

56
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.630
so I know niches another person that's probably not respected in the

57
00:03:39.631 --> 00:03:44.250
philosophy circles because he is full of contradictions full of,

58
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.473
uh.

59
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.070
<v 1>He's just my favorite philosopher. Oh really? Yes. I absolutely love Nicha.</v>

60
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.310
<v 0>So he's deaf, you know, I love people that are full of ideas,</v>

61
00:03:53.311 --> 00:03:58.080
even if they're full of contradictions and niches and Iran is also

62
00:03:58.081 --> 00:04:00.180
that I'm able to, um,

63
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.700
look past the obvious ego that's there on the page. And, uh,

64
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.830
the fact that she actually has in my view, a lot of wrong ideas, uh,

65
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.000
but there's a lot of interesting tidbits to pick up. And, uh, the same,

66
00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:16.920
same goes with Nisha. And, um,

67
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.780
I'm weirded out by the religious aspect here on both the people who like

68
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.450
by and Rand and people who completely dismiss her. I just kind of see it as, Oh,

69
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.980
well,

70
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.490
can we just read a few interesting things and get inspired by it and move on as

71
00:04:32.491 --> 00:04:35.460
opposed to find anything?

72
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.840
Is there something you find about her work that's interesting to you? Um,

73
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.820
or her personality or any of that?

74
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.200
<v 1>Oh, I think she's fascinating. Um, I don't dismiss her. Um,</v>

75
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.210
she was a woman who reached a level of success with her mind

76
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.630
at a time when that was difficult. So, I mean,

77
00:04:54.631 --> 00:04:59.550
she's definitely worth looking at for, for even that reason. Um,

78
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.000
but also, um, her idea, I guess,

79
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.440
part of the situation with random, first of all, I think that, um,

80
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.270
her work is you have to it's misinterpreted. Okay.

81
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.680
And I think that's the same with Nisha. Like a lot of people think that I'm in,

82
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.480
in fact it is the case that niche's writing

83
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.350
before the 20th century. So he's got, you know, he's somewhat,

84
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.990
his rhetoric is sexist and racist and you know, of the time period,

85
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:36.150
right. He was a well educated philosopher of that time

86
00:05:36.151 --> 00:05:38.640
period. However, um,

87
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.980
his books are amazing and niche's philosophy is

88
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.650
incredible. And I think that,

89
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.910
I think that's what you're saying about ran too. And I agree. I mean,

90
00:05:50.911 --> 00:05:55.110
I think that, that, um, we get caught up. I mean,

91
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:56.790
likely we should,

92
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.710
and we should contextualize these thinkers in the time period within which they

93
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:03.080
are, we should not forgive their, you know,

94
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.280
cause there were people during this time that were, you know,

95
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:12.200
a feminist and not racist and things like that. And you know, so,

96
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.700
but uh, each has merit. I mean,

97
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.460
I would say Nisha is an, I,

98
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.240
you did ask me to talk about some of the books that made the largest impact on

99
00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:27.290
me and the niches gay science is one of them is one of the best books

100
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.270
ever. In my opinion.

101
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.090
<v 2>I do think mutual is a,</v>

102
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.800
I don't know about exactly sexist. He certainly was sexist,

103
00:06:35.801 --> 00:06:40.210
but it felt like he didn't get laid much in his life.

104
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.530
It felt like it was extra sexist. I was like,

105
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.390
his theories on women are like angry. He seems frustrated.

106
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:55.300
It's like, all right, calm down, buddy. Uh, the fate of philosophers,

107
00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:58.630
I just ignore everything which is says about women.
