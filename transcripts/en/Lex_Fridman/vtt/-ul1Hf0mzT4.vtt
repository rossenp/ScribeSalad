00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.780
<v 0>What was your feeling on that morning of nine 11?</v>

2
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.340
Who did this?

3
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.750
Isn't that it's not a natural feeling that is coupled with fear of

4
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.830
what's next, especially when you're in DC, but also who is this?

5
00:00:17.831 --> 00:00:21.210
Is this an accident? Is this a deliberate terrorist attack?

6
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.740
Is this a domestic, like,

7
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.930
what were your thoughts of the options and the internal ranking given here? Um,

8
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:30.250
expertise. Yeah.

9
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.900
<v 1>I suppose I was taken by the narrative that this was international.</v>

10
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.731
I mean,

11
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:40.270
I I'd also lived in New York during one of the first bombings in 94 of the world

12
00:00:40.271 --> 00:00:41.104
trade center.

13
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.700
So it was clear to me that a radical community had really fixed New York as part

14
00:00:45.701 --> 00:00:49.570
of their imagination of, and I immediately thought it was, uh, it was, uh,

15
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.520
a kind of blow to American power. And, you know,

16
00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:58.840
I was drawn by the symbolism of, of, uh, you know, if you think of it as an act,

17
00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:02.290
it was a kind of, um, an act of speech, if you will,

18
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.200
kind of a way of speaking to,

19
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.510
from a position of relative weakness, speaking to an Imperial power.

20
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.500
And that I saw, I saw it as a kind of symbolic, you know, speech act of,

21
00:01:14.501 --> 00:01:17.530
of that with horrific, you know, real world, um,

22
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.580
consequences for all as innocent victims for the firearm police and just, uh,

23
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.290
you know, the horror of the moment. Um, so I, I,

24
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.810
I didn't see it as is transcending the United States,

25
00:01:28.811 --> 00:01:32.770
but I did not see it as really having anything necessarily to do fundamentally

26
00:01:32.771 --> 00:01:37.420
about Afghanistan and the history of the region that I'd been studying in the

27
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.070
committee. People that I knew who were not particularly religious, right.

28
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.080
That the guys I hung out with actually wore me out because they wanted to go out

29
00:01:44.081 --> 00:01:47.920
every night. They wanted to party every night we had drinking. Yep.

30
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.870
We had discussions about alcohol. I mean,

31
00:01:49.871 --> 00:01:53.890
it was like a Stalin is famous for its drinking. It's drinking, you know, it's.

32
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.460
<v 0>I look forward to it. So I, I do want to travel to that part of the world.</v>

33
00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.040
When was the last time you were in that part of the world?

34
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.940
<v 1>Early two thousands? Well, when they met two thousands tens. Okay.</v>

35
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.630
<v 0>So, uh, by the way, we're drinking vodka, what what's the per.</v>

36
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.210
<v 1>This is based on has incorporated vodka as, as the, um,</v>

37
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.630
the choice. Um, and I, it, it informs, you know, and it's, but,

38
00:02:17.631 --> 00:02:18.700
but the fascinating thing, you know,

39
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.120
and as a student is what you're observing as a non Muslim, you know,

40
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.330
I'm a non Russian, um, this is all, you know,

41
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.950
culturally new to me, um, you know, a student a while that right,

42
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.390
as a grad student doing my work there.

43
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.560
<v 0>You're like the Jane Goodall, a vodka and Russia just observing.</v>

44
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.660
<v 1>That's. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And then you, you get,</v>

45
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.590
you get the stomach on the grass vodka, you get, you know, I have,

46
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.230
I've had some long nights on the Kazakhstani frontier that I'm not proud of.

47
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.000
Um, you.

48
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.370
<v 0>Know, but you got to know that people and some of them.</v>

49
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.750
<v 1>Actually, so that sort of thing, I mean, the, the,</v>

50
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.150
the fascinating thing there was that, and just as a, I mean, there's a whole,

51
00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.410
yeah, I'm gonna stop worrying, but there,

52
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.150
there are great contributions by anthropologists and

53
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.540
doggies who who've gone across the planet and try to understand how Muslims

54
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.000
understand the attrition, a different contexts.

55
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.470
So many use banks will say, you know, um,

56
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.310
this is part of our national culture to drink any as we please, right.

57
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.470
And yet I'm a very devout Muslim.

58
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.180
And so of course you can encounter other Muslim communities who won't touch

59
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:29.410
alcohol. Right. But it's become kind of, I think it's very much, um, you know,

60
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.290
Soviet culture left a deep impression in each of these places.

61
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:35.710
And so there are ways of thinking ways of, uh,

62
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.360
performing ways of joining oneself that are shared across

63
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.810
Soviet inform of Soviet space to this day. Right. Yeah.

64
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.010
<v 0>And you've written also about Muslims in the Soviet union. Uh,</v>

65
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.430
the there's an article that a, there was a paywall,

66
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.370
so I couldn't read it and I really want to read it is.

67
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.503
<v 1>I'll sharing with you.</v>

68
00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.370
<v 0>Um, Moscow and the mosque or something like that. Right. Um,</v>

69
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.090
by the way, just another tangent on a tangent. Yeah. Uh,

70
00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:06.550
so I bought all your books. I love them very much.

71
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.190
One of the reasons I bought them and read many parts is because they're easy

72
00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:14.740
to buy. Unlike articles,

73
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.820
every single website has a payroll. So it's very,

74
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:24.010
very frustrating to read brilliant scholars such as yourself. Um,

75
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.620
I wish there was one fee I could pay everywhere.

76
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:30.650
I don't care what that fee is because it allows me to read some of your.

77
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.141
<v 1>No, I don't think you're hearing. No.</v>

78
00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:37.000
I think moving towards more kind of open source for money stuff,

79
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:39.130
I think is what a lot of generals are thinking about now.

80
00:04:39.131 --> 00:04:42.940
And I think it's definitely further kind of democratization of knowledge and

81
00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:43.660
scholarship.

82
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.030
That's definitely an important thing that we should all think about.

83
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:48.460
And I think, um, you know,

84
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.100
we need to exert pressure on these publishers to do that.

85
00:04:51.101 --> 00:04:53.770
So I appreciate this is what I'm doing here. Yeah. Good, good.

86
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:54.723
And I appreciate it.

87
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.560
<v 0>So, uh, so your thought was, Afghanistan is not good.</v>

88
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.490
It's not going to be the center course. Okay.

89
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.000
<v 1>It's not the center of this and evade that country isn't gonna fix.</v>

90
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.040
Isn't gonna fix the toxic maelstrom of politics that produced

91
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.090
nine 11. Right. I can just think of some,

92
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.950
the personalities to thinking about going back to the Tashkent story,

93
00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:22.150
which I'll end with, I mean, just observing, you know, real Muslims doing,

94
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.820
doing things, and then asking questions about it and,

95
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.320
and trying to understand through their eyes, what tradition means to them.

96
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.420
And then, you know, you have, uh, we had,

97
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.230
we had a very narrow conversation about what Islam is that, you know,

98
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.490
generated immediately exploded in, you know, on the day of nine 11. Right. Um,

99
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.720
and then of course, um, I think the antipathy toward Islam and Muslims,

100
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.580
you know, it was formed by, by racism informed by xenophobia.

101
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.740
So it became a perfect storm. I think of demonization that didn't sit with,

102
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:54.070
you know,

103
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.950
what I knew about the tradition and with actual people that I had known,

104
00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:58.503
because I'm going back to, I mean,

105
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.980
there were other friends and encounters and so on,

106
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:03.770
but just thinking about Afghanistan and, and it, for a moment, I mean,

107
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.340
just the thought of my friends who had been,

108
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.290
who had suffered a great deal in their short lives.

109
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.310
Who've been cast aside from country to country,

110
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.060
but had found a place in Tashkent with some relative stability.

111
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.980
And they wanted to go out every night. And, you know, they explained, you know,

112
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.350
one friend we, we talked about about the alcohol and all that, and he,

113
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.010
he didn't get crazy, but he was like, you can drink, but just don't get drunk.

114
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.390
That's, that's permissible within Islam. Right. Um, and he was,

115
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.170
you know, I think Pashtoon, I think he was back, had a different view, you know,

116
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.810
often the more vodka the better. Yeah.

117
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.140
And it doesn't violate as I understand Islam. So even yet,

118
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.281
it's kind of a silly example,

119
00:06:43.281 --> 00:06:46.280
but it's just an illustration of the ways in which different communities,

120
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.430
different generations, different people can come at this very complex,

121
00:06:49.431 --> 00:06:51.650
rich tradition in some different ways.

122
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.880
So obviously if whatever kind of scholar you are, any kind of expert,

123
00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:56.810
whatever your, you know,

124
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:02.090
it's always disconcerting to see your field of specialization be flattened,

125
00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:03.770
right. And then be flattened in the,

126
00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.340
be turned to arguments for violence.

127
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.980
<v 0>With the natural human feelings of hate and, uh.</v>

128
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.750
<v 1>And pain. So I, you know, I mean that day, I, I vividly remember, I sat with,</v>

129
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.430
um, other PhD historians in different fields. We, you know,

130
00:07:22.431 --> 00:07:26.420
we oddly enough had lunch that day and it kind of deserted Washington,

131
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.660
some place was opened. We went, um, and we just thought, you know,

132
00:07:29.661 --> 00:07:33.980
this is going to kind of open up like a great mall of destruction

133
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:35.870
and, you know,

134
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:40.520
the American state is going to destroy and it's going to

135
00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:42.110
destroy in this geography.

136
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:47.360
And I thought that was misplaced for lots of reasons. And then I think if, when,

137
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.320
you know, I'd been doing some research on I've kind of signed,

138
00:07:51.321 --> 00:07:56.270
then I was kind of shifting south. And I had been looking at the top on, um,

139
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.610
from afar for some years. And, you know,

140
00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:01.640
I think it's clear now that in retrospect,

141
00:08:01.641 --> 00:08:05.030
there were opportunities for alternative policies at that moment.

142
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.710
<v 0>So what should the conversation have been like,</v>

143
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:13.430
what should we have done differently? Because,

144
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.200
you know,

145
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.520
from a perspective of the time the United States was invaded

146
00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:24.530
by a, a foreign force, what is the proper response or the,

147
00:08:24.531 --> 00:08:27.380
what is the proper conversation about the popper as part of the time?

148
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:28.401
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

149
00:08:28.401 --> 00:08:32.540
I know my colleague at Sanford Condoleezza rice would tell me this is above my

150
00:08:32.541 --> 00:08:34.670
pay grade. And, um, you know,

151
00:08:34.671 --> 00:08:39.350
she makes a point in your classes to talk about how difficult decision-making is

152
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:43.370
under such intense pressure. And I appreciate that. Um, you know,

153
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.780
I am a historian who sits safely in my office. I don't like battlefields.

154
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:52.100
I don't like taking risks. Um, so I can see all those limits.

155
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.660
I'm not a military expert.

156
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.030
I've been accused of being a spy wherever I've gone because of the way I look

157
00:08:57.031 --> 00:09:00.860
and because of my nationality and so on, but not a spy. So I differ, you know,

158
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.850
I respect the expertise of all those communities,

159
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:07.560
but I think they acted out of ignorance. They acted, I think because, I mean,

160
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:08.423
if you think of the,

161
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:13.410
in a way there was a compensatory aspect of this decision making, I mean,

162
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:18.720
the Bush administration failed, this is an extraordinary failure, right?

163
00:09:18.721 --> 00:09:19.590
So if we start to.

164
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:20.610
<v 0>Weigh, if we're coming back.</v>

165
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.680
<v 1>Down the of intelligence, I mean, if they,</v>

166
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.880
if you follow the story of Richard Clarke, um, who's Richard Clark.

167
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.830
He was a national security expert who was tasked with following Al-Qaeda,

168
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.750
who had, uh,

169
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.800
produced a dossier under the Clinton ministration that he passed on to the

170
00:09:37.801 --> 00:09:42.480
George W. Bush administration. And if you look at the work of Condoleeza rice,

171
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.840
she wrote a very famous, I think, unpaid Wald, uh,

172
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:49.980
foreign affairs article that you can read announcing the George W.

173
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:54.180
Bush foreign policy, you kind of outlook. Um, and it was all about great powers.

174
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.850
It's about the rise of China is about Russia. I mean,

175
00:09:56.851 --> 00:10:01.590
there's definitely a kind of hangover of those who

176
00:10:01.591 --> 00:10:06.090
missed having Russia as the boogeyman who spoke, you know,

177
00:10:06.091 --> 00:10:07.530
the Clinton station repeated again, again,

178
00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:11.940
the idea of making sure the bear stayed in his cage, um,

179
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:16.950
which is why the United States through a lifeline to the central Asian

180
00:10:16.951 --> 00:10:19.650
states, hoping to have pipelines,

181
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:25.080
hoping to shore up their national sovereignty as a way of containing

182
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:30.750
Russia initially. Uh, but also Iran, you know, which sets to the south and west,

183
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.390
and then perfectly looking down the road to China, to the east. So the, the.

184
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.490
<v 0>There is what like Russia,</v>

185
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:44.070
or is it kinda like some weird combination, Russia, Iran and China.

186
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:49.440
<v 1>The bear is Russia and Russia is this I'm thinking I'm</v>

187
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:53.670
trying to characterize the imagination of some of these bachelor figures. Um,

188
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.580
this is an image formed in the cold war. I mean,

189
00:10:56.581 --> 00:11:01.290
it has deeper seeds and European and Western intellectual thought that go back

190
00:11:01.291 --> 00:11:06.270
at least to the 1850s and the reign of Tsar Nicholas. The first,

191
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.180
when we first get this language about, um,

192
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.260
the Russian empire is this kind of evil, uh, polity,

193
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:18.090
obviously this was a kind of pillar of Reaganism. Um,

194
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.090
but the Clinton folks kept that alive, alive. They wanted to make sure that,

195
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:22.440
you know,

196
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:27.200
American power would be unmatched and they being creatures of

197
00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:32.220
Colbert themselves. They look to Russia as a recession power. Well,

198
00:11:32.221 --> 00:11:34.650
before Putin was even thought of.

199
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:40.170
<v 0>You mentioned one deep, uh, profound historical piece,</v>

200
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.650
and Rambo is probably, uh, the whole, this,

201
00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:47.460
this conflict has to do with another Selessa thumb movie of Rocky four,

202
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:52.650
which is also historically accurate and based on as basically a documentary.

203
00:11:52.651 --> 00:11:56.560
So, um, there, there is something about the American power,

204
00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:00.700
even at the level of Condoleezza rice, these respected, uh,

205
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:02.830
deep kind of, uh,

206
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:08.140
leaders and thinkers about history in the future where they like

207
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:13.030
to have competition with other superpowers and almost, uh,

208
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.610
conjure up superpowers,

209
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:20.380
even when those countries don't, maybe at the time,

210
00:12:20.381 --> 00:12:22.450
at least deserve the label of superpower.

211
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.380
<v 1>That's right. Good point. Yeah. They're all LLS and points. So yeah, I mean,</v>

212
00:12:26.381 --> 00:12:30.640
Russia was, I think many, many experts will be my, my mentor at Princeton. Um,

213
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:34.330
Stephen Hawkin was then writing great things about how, you know,

214
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:38.690
if you look at Russia's economy, the scale of its GDP, you know,

215
00:12:38.691 --> 00:12:43.240
its capacity to actually add globally, it's all quite limited. Um,

216
00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:47.410
but Connie rice and the people around her, you know,

217
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.350
came into power with George W. Bush thinking that, you know,

218
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:55.090
the foreign policy challenges of her era would be those of the past, right.

219
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.660
But your Clark and others within the ministration mourn that in fact,

220
00:12:58.661 --> 00:13:02.050
there is this group that is declared war against United States,

221
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.370
and they are coming for us.

222
00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:08.380
The FBI had been following these people around for many months. So, you know,

223
00:13:08.381 --> 00:13:12.550
by the time George W. Bush comes to power, lots of Alcott activists are well,

224
00:13:12.551 --> 00:13:16.360
not lots, but, you know, uh, perhaps a dozen or so are already, you know,

225
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:19.090
training in the United States. Right. Um,

226
00:13:19.091 --> 00:13:21.700
and what we knew immediately from the biographies of some of the characters of

227
00:13:21.701 --> 00:13:26.230
the attackers of nine 11, it was a hodgepodge of people from across the planet,

228
00:13:26.231 --> 00:13:28.360
but most of them were Saudi, right.

229
00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:32.740
And that was known very early on or presumed very on. So again,

230
00:13:32.741 --> 00:13:36.330
if we go back to your big question about the geography, why Afghanistan, it,

231
00:13:36.331 --> 00:13:37.360
it didn't add up, right.

232
00:13:37.361 --> 00:13:40.330
It seemed to me that Afghanistan was a kind of soft target.

233
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.830
It was a place to have explosions to seemingly

234
00:13:44.831 --> 00:13:48.280
recapture American supremacy. Um, and also I think, you know,

235
00:13:48.281 --> 00:13:49.960
there was in many quarters, there was, uh,

236
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:54.550
a deep urge for revenge and this was the place to have some casualties,

237
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.550
have some explosions. And then I think, you know,

238
00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:01.480
restore the legitimacy of the Bush administration by showing that we are in

239
00:14:01.481 --> 00:14:06.400
charge, we will pay, I think it was a very old fashioned punitive dimension,

240
00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:11.050
which rest upon the presumption that if we intimidate these people they'll know

241
00:14:11.051 --> 00:14:14.890
not to try this again. Right. All these, I would suggest are all misreadings of,

242
00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:18.940
uh, of an organization that was always global. It had no real center. I mean,

243
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.310
it called itself the center that's one way to translate all kinda,

244
00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.210
but that center was really any imagination. Um,

245
00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.310
bin Laden bounced around from country to country. Um, and crucially, I think,

246
00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:34.300
uh, I'd mentioned that I don't claim to know anything new about,

247
00:14:34.301 --> 00:14:38.080
but his endured as a kind of doubt is the role of Saudi Arabia.

248
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.880
And the fact that, you know, the muscle in that operation of nine 11 was,

249
00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:47.230
was howdy, right? I mean, this was a Saudi operation with, if one thinks again,

250
00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:52.190
just on the basis of nationalities, Saudis, and adoption, or two 11,

251
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:57.140
these guy and the Egyptian guy had been studying in Germany.

252
00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:58.670
He was an urban planner.
