00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.640
<v 0>I really enjoy Nicha. Okay. So anything by Nicha, Frederick nature,</v>

2
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.800
he's a philosopher. Um,

3
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.670
I actually hated him when I first read him in my early twenties.

4
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.370
<v 1>Let's take the opposite of most people's experience. Right.</v>

5
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.600
They usually love them in their twenties and then they throw them to the curb.

6
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.350
<v 0>Later. Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.360
I think he's totally misrepresented and misinterpreted.

8
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.870
Well, it happened in one night. So let me just describe it.

9
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.560
Cause it's kind of funny having on new year's. So I had friends in,

10
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.140
when I was in my twenties and they were kept, they kept telling me,

11
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.400
you have to reteach, you have to reteach it. And I tried. Okay. But again,

12
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.990
you know, no,

13
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.760
I didn't like I was not into how he described the philosophical

14
00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:53.150
concepts he was trying to get across. So, but they would,

15
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.080
they weren't giving up. I very, um, persistent friends.

16
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.110
So one of them gave me, um,

17
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.340
the gay science and I had it on my bookstand

18
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.630
and it was new year's Eve. And I'm actually not a big part.

19
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.960
I'm actually an introvert on the I'm a geeky introvert. Okay.

20
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.740
So I don't go out and party a lot. It was a year new year's Eve.

21
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.270
Even that couldn't get me out to go party.

22
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.490
So I just wanted to go to bed and years Eve hit and everybody went out and I

23
00:01:22.491 --> 00:01:26.240
was asleep and they woke me up and I was like, darn, they woke me up. Eh,

24
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.280
might as well read this book by Nicha. Okay.

25
00:01:28.281 --> 00:01:30.320
So I picked it up and lo and behold,

26
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.000
I turned to a page that was exactly about it was called Sanctus January,

27
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.320
which is basically St. January. And it was about new year's Eve. And I thought,

28
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.070
Whoa, what a weird coincidence. And it was a really,

29
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.820
it was also super Catholic and it was a really beautiful little aphorism.

30
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.930
It's actually a book of aphorisms, which are kind of religious. Right.

31
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.310
And so he beat it's really just, uh, the genres religious let's put it that way,

32
00:01:55.311 --> 00:01:57.710
but he's not. So basically he says,

33
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.690
today's the day when people are supposed to make these resolutions. Right.

34
00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:07.130
And he says, from here on out, I will, will never say no,

35
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.980
I will only say yes. Okay. I look away.

36
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.040
If some of these horrible I'll just look away from it. I won't get angry at it.

37
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.830
And then he also says, I will be like Saint,

38
00:02:15.831 --> 00:02:20.510
January and Saint January is actually the Saint whose blood is in

39
00:02:20.511 --> 00:02:23.660
this place in Italy. I think it's in Italy. And um,

40
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.430
and every year it turns, it turns to blood again. So it's like,

41
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.470
it's desiccated it's, you know, so it's this miracle. It says, my blood is now,

42
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.850
um, it flows again. And I was like, wow, that's really beautiful. And I said,

43
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.170
and a strange coincidence because it just turned, you know, 12.

44
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.940
So it was like new year's Eve. I pick up the book, I read this aphorism. I said,

45
00:02:46.941 --> 00:02:48.590
strange coincidence that,

46
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.060
and then I turn the page and the page is about coincidences. And I was like,

47
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.380
I shut it. And I thought, this is weird. And I felt like there was a lie.

48
00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.250
I felt like the book was alive in each was to me. Right.

49
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.160
I had a like experience and engagement with Nisha.

50
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.840
And so after that I couldn't put his stuff down. It was engaging,

51
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:11.680
fascinating everything. So, yeah. So that's one book, the gay science.

52
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.010
<v 2>What'd you, what did you pick up from, from uh,</v>

53
00:03:14.011 --> 00:03:16.740
the gay science or from each year in January? Is there some ideas that.

54
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.680
<v 0>The idea is basically that, um,</v>

55
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.010
truth he's got awesome.

56
00:03:23.011 --> 00:03:27.990
One-liners you know, so truth is a woman, so, okay.

57
00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:32.280
What is it, what does he mean by that truth is a woman. Basically.

58
00:03:32.281 --> 00:03:35.160
She's going to lie to you. She looks real attractive,

59
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.320
but she's not going to tell you the truth.

60
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.910
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

61
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.970
<v 0>Okay. So basically I'm not saying that that's true about women.</v>

62
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.830
I'm obviously a woman. So he's,

63
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.210
so basically what he's saying is that truth is not, is like what I say,

64
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.720
brother guy said, it's a moving target. Okay.

65
00:03:54.721 --> 00:03:58.110
We started this whole conversation with what's real. Right.

66
00:03:58.111 --> 00:04:00.450
So I should have just gone straight to Nisha, having not,

67
00:04:00.451 --> 00:04:01.710
you heard truth as a woman.

68
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.620
<v 2>Okay. So truth.</v>

69
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.460
<v 0>Is a woman. All right. So that, and also, and you know, food code, this, um,</v>

70
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.240
other philosopher,

71
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.350
French philosopher actually takes up this idea and creates his own

72
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.290
framework or called genealogy from it.

73
00:04:16.291 --> 00:04:20.550
So the genealogy of morals so that we only believe certain things in, we,

74
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.900
we sediment to them into truth. So we say, you know,

75
00:04:24.901 --> 00:04:29.220
a truth told who said that was at Lennon or stolen a truth

76
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.080
told enough times, I mean, a lie told enough times becomes the truth.

77
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.860
Yeah. So that's basically Nietzschean right there. Okay. So that's nature.

78
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.640
So you need to also as a huge critic of Christianity, um,

79
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.870
which I'm actually Catholic, I'm a practicing Catholic. So, uh,

80
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.610
I appreciated his critique. I thought it was actually quite accurate. Um,

81
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.510
he's a critique of religion in general and, and he's fascinating.

82
00:04:54.511 --> 00:04:56.130
And also I find that his,

83
00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.900
he talks about altered States of consciousness and he calls them elevated

84
00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:04.110
States. And he, I think through his book,

85
00:05:04.111 --> 00:05:07.890
you can actually experience elevated States. So, um, yeah, Nisha.
