00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.950
<v 0>So, um,</v>

2
00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.150
my buddy Ryan holiday had a series of books still does where he takes the ideas

3
00:00:08.151 --> 00:00:12.560
of the Stoics and he applies them to contemporary, uh, terms.

4
00:00:12.561 --> 00:00:14.900
He has this whole cottage industry that he's doing very well with.

5
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.950
And I'd asked him years ago, if I could do that with Kemo and he's like, sure,

6
00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:23.690
go for it. And I was going to rework, Kamoze the myth of Sisyphus.

7
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.140
And I read it recently. I re-read it.

8
00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:29.930
And this wasn't the book I remembered at all. Uh, and I'm like, okay,

9
00:00:29.931 --> 00:00:34.400
I'm going to write the book that I remembered, but the more I was writing it,

10
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.610
I, one of the things I always yell at conservatives about,

11
00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:41.360
and there's a long list is they don't talk about, um,

12
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.490
the great victory of conservatism,

13
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.870
which was the winning of the cold war without firing a shot. And I said,

14
00:00:47.871 --> 00:00:50.510
you can't expect the New York times to tell this story because the blood is on

15
00:00:50.511 --> 00:00:54.710
their hands. And I'm like, well, Michael,

16
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.730
instead of complaining about it, why don't you do it? Why don't you talk?

17
00:00:58.731 --> 00:01:01.490
That is a great example of the good guys winning over the bad guys.

18
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.790
And that's become a it's.

19
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.590
The victory is beautiful, but also pointing out to people when people are like,

20
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.060
Oh, things are worse than they've ever been.

21
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.050
They don't appreciate how bad things were in the thirties. Uh,

22
00:01:15.051 --> 00:01:19.610
what Stalin was doing overseas and how people in the West were advocating

23
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:20.900
to bring that here.

24
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.180
So that's kind of pointing out how bad things were and how good

25
00:01:26.181 --> 00:01:28.250
they became. And, uh,

26
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.750
you don't have to be Republican or conservative to be delighted at the collapse

27
00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:35.540
of totalitarianism and the peaceful liberation of half the world.

28
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.730
So that's a picture of the good guys winning. Oh yeah.

29
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.100
How does that connect to Sufis and, uh,

30
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.170
maybe to speak deeper to life and the,

31
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.330
whatever the hell this thing is,

32
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.920
which is what I remember the Mythicist Sufis being about.

33
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.480
So where does the threat of Como sort of, um,

34
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.950
lie in the work that you're doing? So the myth of Sisyphus,

35
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.060
which I had remembered incorrectly, it's actually just a five, seven,

36
00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:09.050
five to seven page, uh, like Coda to the whole book at the very end.

37
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.570
Like you only need to read that little essay called the myth of Sisyphus.

38
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.580
The broader work is about [inaudible] concept of the absurd and the absurd man

39
00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:18.650
within literature. And he's goes, and it's just like,

40
00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:21.530
I don't really care about the character and dusty FC and all this other stuff

41
00:02:21.531 --> 00:02:24.590
that you're talking about. It's of no relevance, but what he,

42
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.560
the myth of Sisyphus, the myth itself, not the book or the,

43
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.680
or the essay of his is this Greek character.

44
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.150
And specifically is forced in hell to, uh, roll a rock up a Hill,

45
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.370
uh, for attorney at the very last moment,

46
00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:42.200
the rock falls away and can mus take away from the stories that we have to ma

47
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.670
we must imagine Sisyphus happy, and there are several interpretations of this,

48
00:02:46.671 --> 00:02:51.200
but one is once you accept that you are living an

49
00:02:51.201 --> 00:02:55.130
absurdist existence, once you own your reality,

50
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.650
it loses its um,

51
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.290
bite and can start with that as your kind of

52
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.520
baseline and bite is suffering and

53
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:07.360
hopelessness.

54
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.490
So I think when people look at how much

55
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.580
ridiculousness is happening in America, and it's escalating,

56
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.870
you can either think, Oh, all is lost or you can.

57
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.000
And I think you and I have lived our lives like this.

58
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:23.740
You can live life more like a surfer,

59
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.700
whereas you're never going to control the ocean, but you can sure.

60
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:32.110
Enjoy that ride and stop if you're trying to control the waves. Yeah,

61
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.320
you're done. But if you're like, all right, I've got my board,

62
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.340
I'm going to see where this takes me surfing from what I understand is a pretty

63
00:03:39.341 --> 00:03:42.940
fun activity and also sometimes dangerous. But you'd have to ask,

64
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:43.600
tell us about that.
