1
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.640
<v 0>Every time I meet a weird person. Somebody to me,</v>

2
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.360
heroism is also taking a risk to, uh,

3
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.880
rebel against mediocrity. Yeah. Like in,

4
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.880
in the most simplest of ways, like the, the license address,

5
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.190
like taking a risk to break the little bit of rule that nobody will know about

6
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.110
to take that little bit of a, a leap of like that,

7
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:30.910
that little protest against the bureaucracy. Well.

8
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.710
<v 1>Like that Nazi guard conformity, where he just spoke out. He's like, Hey lady,</v>

9
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.710
but that's a big.

10
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.750
<v 0>One. Oh, that's a sure, sure.</v>

11
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.190
I mean like literally at the line at Starbucks or something like that,

12
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.390
like even in the tiniest of ways,

13
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.740
when I see people just like, it's almost like that little,

14
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.260
like glimer in their eye, a wink, like we're in this together. This there's,

15
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.820
there's all this conformity all around us.

16
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.140
That's at a different time could have been Nazi. Germany could have been, uh,

17
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.020
Stalin and Soviet union. Sure. We're in this together.

18
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.860
We're going to rebel against that conformity by

19
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.170
just taking the risk, that little bit of risk against mediocrity. I don't know.

20
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.770
And that, and then once again, I see this in companies too,

21
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.850
when I see the mediocrity, um, I see this, you know, I used to work at Google.

22
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.810
I see it in Google. When the companies grow that mediocrity is overwhelming.

23
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.760
The P Peter principle, right? The Peter principle. Yeah. Yeah.

24
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.080
My hope is that all of us have the possibility for that glimmer, that, um,

25
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.160
that risk taking the, the leap of faith, whatever the heck,

26
00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:40.520
that is the leap out of the ordinary, out of the conformity,

27
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.840
out of the mediocrity.

28
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.590
<v 1>So, so this is where you and I disagree. I, I think, think most,</v>

29
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.750
a lot of people do are not capable.

30
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.310
<v 0>Of that. They're accustomed to it. I don't know if they're not capable. No.</v>

31
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.950
<v 1>I, I, my POS, I understand your position. I'm disagreeing with it.</v>

32
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.630
I'm saying I do not think they're capable.

33
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.750
I think a lot of people effectively don't have souls.

34
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.470
They do not have a conscience in this sense where they're going to look at an

35
00:02:04.471 --> 00:02:07.860
issue, bring their are critical thinking and say, all right,

36
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.380
I am going to do the right thing. Although I'm taking a risk.

37
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.300
<v 0>Don't do you think thinking is involved or is it just taking that leap?</v>

38
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.980
There there's something about that basic human spirit.

39
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.220
Forget the thinking part it's it is just saying like,

40
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.100
I'll take that risk. The taking that adventure,

41
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.050
the same thing out people to explore the seas, you know, the, the,

42
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.250
uh, throughout human civilization, explore land, explore the oceans like that,

43
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.530
explore exploration. Like we've done stuff this way, all this time.

44
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.170
I'm gonna take a leap. And that comes outta the nowhere. Seemingly a.

45
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.120
<v 1>Lot of those people are the heroes, but don't don't think that's universal.</v>

46
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.800
I re there was, I'm gonna use a very go example.

47
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.520
There was a show called scare tactics, which was basically a candid camera,

48
00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.280
but they would scare people like they'd have vampires, whatever,

49
00:02:59.281 --> 00:03:04.120
and hidden camera and people's reactions. And so a lot of,

50
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.760
but sometimes it, the prank didn't work out like they expected.

51
00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.800
So there was one where they were hiring some, the people who were the marks,

52
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:15.400
you know, the contestants, so to speak was, would hire to be a security guard.

53
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.550
Okay. And you have to watch this, this factory overnight and you get paid.

54
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.430
And what the setup was,

55
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.590
some people were breaking out of the factory in the middle of the night,

56
00:03:25.591 --> 00:03:28.830
like in rags. And they were saying they were keeping us prisoner here,

57
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.670
like blah, blah, and just watched the person reaction to this.

58
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.030
And there was one security guard where there,

59
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.430
he basically forced them back into the building. And there're like,

60
00:03:38.431 --> 00:03:42.020
there were us 24, 7, we're getting beat. And he's like, I'm here to do a job,

61
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.980
get back in there. And you watch this.

62
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.540
And it never even enters his head to be like, something's wrong here.

63
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.740
He was given his orders, he's following his orders. And to me,

64
00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.370
that is not uncommon. And that person, although they look like you and I, uh,

65
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.730
uh, there's something essentially human missing with them now very quickly.

66
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.970
The reaction is, well, it's one step from there to Nazi.

67
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.130
I don't think it's something that it,

68
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.730
I'm not saying this person should be killed,

69
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.010
but I'm just saying to expect that every human being has

70
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.400
the capacity to have that defiance, especially at across their own life,

71
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.520
that I think is not realistic. Uh, and I, but at the same time,

72
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.480
I feel like an octopus on the eighth hand, it is those few of us.

73
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.800
Or if you wanna include me in this who do make these tiny

74
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.790
little protests who look the other way, when someone is hungry,

75
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.350
who's stealing food from the supermarket, right? It's like, all right, like I,

76
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.223
I, I'm gonna pretend.

77
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.230
I didn't see anything that those little elements of heroism are what

78
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.230
move human humanity forward and demonstrate the

79
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.430
validity of the human experience. Uh,

80
00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:02.660
whereas everyone else is kind of like seen, I think.

81
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.340
<v 0>Almost everybody in the world can derive deep meaning and pleasure from having</v>

82
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.820
done those courageous acts.

83
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.780
And I also think they have the capacity to do them to discover that meaning and

84
00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:15.180
happiness.

85
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.860
<v 1>So you're the cynic then? Why aren't they doing it?</v>

86
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.020
<v 0>They haven't gotten a chance to, like, I've never, uh,</v>

87
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.850
to L S D or a DMT.

88
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.730
You haven't gotten the chance to try this amazing journey,

89
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.250
which is taking the risk that's rebellion.

90
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.890
<v 1>Because as you just said, two minutes ago,</v>

91
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.170
everyone has that chance every day to do the right.

92
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.170
<v 0>Thing. And we have the chance to do a lot of things.</v>

93
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.040
And we don't realize there's a lot of stuff right in front of our knows that we

94
00:05:43.041 --> 00:05:47.720
don't realize, right, is you have to kind of wake up to it. And sometimes, uh,

95
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.200
you, you need the catalyst.

96
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.600
There needs to be some kind of thing that happens that wakes you up.

97
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.760
That the fact that most people don't

98
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.720
take the small acts of rebellion doesn't mean they don't have the capacity to

99
00:06:03.721 --> 00:06:07.920
both do so. And to derive a lot of meaning from it,

100
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:09.463
then it's a,

101
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.080
a discussion about how to create societies that get more and more people to be

102
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.230
free actors and free thinkers. That's, that's the question. And that,

103
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.710
that probably leads us into a discussion of AISM and so on. But yeah,

104
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.390
I just think we are very young as a species.

105
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.510
We're trying to figure out how to get ourselves to first be

106
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.950
collaborative, but at the same time, be free spirits. And I think both of the,

107
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.940
those are within human nature for.

108
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:39.460
<v 1>Most of us.</v>

109
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.340
I think another big concern is that there's enormous disincentives

110
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.340
and this is Michael malice speaking. Yeah. Uh,

111
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.180
for human beings to be kind and for tenderness. And I think,

112
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.460
uh, especially when you're young, you know what I mean? When you're immature,

113
00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:00.010
a lot of times some will reach out to you with kindness or vulnerability,

114
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.330
and you think it's funny to kind of dunk the head under water in a pool or

115
00:07:03.331 --> 00:07:06.250
something like that. Yeah. And when you get older, you look, I, I, there,

116
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:10.570
you know, there's this one, uh, example of this, this was a,

117
00:07:10.571 --> 00:07:15.050
this was in the nineties and there was a woman. She became a like, uh,

118
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.490
like stripper or something like that or whatever it was.

119
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:21.760
But she had amazing body. She was just gorgeous. And the show was,

120
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.760
she was talking about how, when she was in high school, she was bullied a lot.

121
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.520
And that there was this football player. He messed with her every single day.

122
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.320
And like at one day she even threw pickles in her hair and her hair smelled like

123
00:07:32.321 --> 00:07:35.920
pickles and her was laughing and her, and this really screwed her up. I mean,

124
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.630
up to that show and they took her backstage and brought out the football player.

125
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.150
And now he's a dad and a regular dude. And he's like,

126
00:07:43.151 --> 00:07:45.790
do you know what they're like? Do you know why you're here? And he's like, no.

127
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.670
And they're like, oh, what you like in high school? I was like, oh,

128
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:49.350
it was kind of a jock, you know, bully, whatever.

129
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.430
And they brought her out and he didn't even remember her really. And she was,

130
00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:55.710
starts crying about the pickles and whatever, and this,

131
00:07:55.711 --> 00:07:57.190
something that affected her for like 20 years.

132
00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.980
And I've never seen a clear example of someone who wanted to kill themselves.

133
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.660
And this guy, like the guilt on his face,

134
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.820
and he's looking at her and he's desperate to be like,

135
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:12.620
what can I do to take your pain away to make it better? Uh,

136
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:13.660
like, I, I, I,

137
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.380
he was just crippled by it cuz he knew there's nothing he could do.

138
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.820
He knew he a hundred percent did the wrong thing.

139
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.050
He knew he did the wrong thing. Unthinkingly. Like you can imagine, you know,

140
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.250
I gotta screw over this lady to feed my family. You know that that's fine. You,

141
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.610
but for, it was at the time it meant nothing to him.

142
00:08:29.611 --> 00:08:32.370
So of course he didn't remember mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and he was just paralyzed

143
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.130
by this sense of crippling guilt.

144
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:37.730
One of the reasons I always tried to do the right thing is said,

145
00:08:37.731 --> 00:08:41.160
because I'm inherently good person, which I do not think I am.

146
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.520
I don't think anyone is inherently good,

147
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:47.480
but because I will feel guilty about it for a very, very long time.

148
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.960
Because if you do the wrong thing, this is a very canoe idea.

149
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:56.200
If you do the wrong thing to a good person, that's really,

150
00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:57.453
really bad.

151
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.480
Cuz what kind of person are you in the same way that everyone can be?

152
00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:02.840
That guy who takes someone out for their birthday,

153
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.200
everyone has that ability for someone who did the wrong thing to someone who's a

154
00:09:08.201 --> 00:09:12.800
normal person. And do you want to be that guy as well? My friend, uh, um,

155
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.430
Stein, he's a, um, uh, big gold, uh, excuse me, Bitcoin person,

156
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:20.630
my biography, ego and hubris is like $500.

157
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.030
Now in eBay it's like hard to find came out in 2006.

158
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:28.550
And he had told me that, you know, you can get it on, on torrent.

159
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:31.670
It's it's downloadable. And I'm like, oh, I thought if you're my friend,

160
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:35.380
you know, you'd wanna buy it at the time. It was not $500 I should or you,

161
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.900
and it goes, I did buy it.

162
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.820
I'm just telling you that you could also get it for free this information that

163
00:09:40.821 --> 00:09:43.580
you might wanna use. And I felt I'm like,

164
00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.820
I snapped at this kid who was doing right by me.

165
00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.500
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and I felt it just stuck in my head. I'm like, you're an.

166
00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.460
Yeah. And then years later, I apologize. He didn't had no memory of this at all.

167
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:59.570
I'm glad to be able to reiterate the apology again. But you know, this is,

168
00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:04.330
you know, a lot of times I'm extremely aggressive on Twitter and in other venues

169
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:08.250
I always try to, and maybe I fail and that's my moral failing.

170
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:13.090
Always do it as a counter attack. If you're gonna start going personal,

171
00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.690
if you're gonna start being aggressive against an individual,

172
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.600
I'm not going to necessarily hold back when I reciprocate.

173
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.880
And it's something that is very common on social media,

174
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.520
but I don't think it is normal. I just,

175
00:10:25.521 --> 00:10:27.560
because a lot of this is you were talking about the,

176
00:10:27.561 --> 00:10:31.520
the quiet little rebellion just because everyone else around you thinks it's

177
00:10:31.521 --> 00:10:34.880
okay to just go up to people and attack them in the most personal ways.

178
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.990
IM prompted cuz of their views.

179
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:40.870
Really just take a step back and realize what you're engaging with. Now.

180
00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.950
If that's the fight they want, then you know,

181
00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:48.270
my Soviet cruelty could come out and that's kind of why I don't drink cuz I do

182
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:52.830
enjoy it. Yeah. But the same time be aware of what you're doing. And, and,

183
00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.750
and again, this goes back to Kamoo um,

184
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.580
sense that conscience really is what makes us human beings. Yeah.

185
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:01.613
Well that's the thing I was saying.

186
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.860
I don't think most people think in terms of conscience, they don't think it,

187
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:10.020
they, we are taught. This is that this is that, that creeping cynicism that, oh,

188
00:11:10.021 --> 00:11:14.820
grow up when you're an adult, you have to make sacrifices, blah, blah, blah.

189
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.300
And even if I buy that for a second, which I don't,

190
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.730
but if I have to make sacrifices,

191
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.410
sometimes that doesn't mean it's okay for me to make a sacrifice of my values

192
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:25.690
in this moment.

193
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:29.650
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; if I have to maybe be at work and my boss is a jerk to me

194
00:11:29.651 --> 00:11:32.970
and calls me names, I have to be humiliated, but I gotta put food in the plate.

195
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.530
That doesn't mean it's okay. Later if I'm at a party and I'm just, you know,

196
00:11:37.531 --> 00:11:39.240
extremely ends up to someone for no reason.
