WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.590
<v 0>You know, Hitler spoke to, he could speak things like inflation, right.</v>

2
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.510
Which really existed. Um,

3
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.910
but he also appealed to the irrational emotions of Germans. Right.

4
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.870
He sought out scapegoats, you know, Jews, Roma,

5
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.870
um, disabled people, homosexuals and so on. Right. I mean, that's also,

6
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.180
there had been lot two, I mean, daddy of, um, you know, a, an antisemitism,

7
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.700
uh, the constant flagging of Zionist and crusaders,

8
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.020
it's the kind of shotgun approach to a search for followers.

9
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.740
But I also hazed to add that it's for all of the things that we could tick off

10
00:00:38.741 --> 00:00:42.460
saying, well, yes, cash Mary's have suffered CHES have suffered.

11
00:00:42.461 --> 00:00:47.330
And so on &lt;affirmative&gt; um, bin lad is never became a mass movement.

12
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.650
I mean, it never really, I think the, I mean,

13
00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:55.450
this is the encouraging thing, right. About ideology. I mean, I think the,

14
00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.010
the blood on his hands always limited his appeal among Muslims and others.

15
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.280
Um, but bin lad did have, I mean, he had a, there's a, there's a great book by,

16
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.360
um, a great scholar at, at UC San Diego. Um,

17
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.440
Jeremy pres hut who read a great book about global icons in which, uh,

18
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.320
he has bin Laden. He has, um, uh, Bob Marley,

19
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.000
he has Tupac, you know, he ask why, you know,

20
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:25.670
when he's doing research, uh, in east Africa,

21
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.790
why did he see young kids wearing bin Laden shirts?

22
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.430
They're also wearing like Tupac shirts they're wearing BI Bob Marley shirts.

23
00:01:33.431 --> 00:01:36.430
And basically it's a way of, of looking at, um,

24
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.430
a kind of partial embrace of some aspects of

25
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.070
the rebellious nest of some of these figures,

26
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.860
some of the time by some people under certain conditions.

27
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.300
<v 1>Well, the terrifying thing to me, so yeah,</v>

28
00:01:50.301 --> 00:01:55.260
there is a longing and a human heart to belong to a group and a charismatic

29
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.820
leader somehow, especially when you're young,

30
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.900
just a catalyst for all of that. And I tend to think

31
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.770
that perhaps actually hard to be Hitler, so a,

32
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.770
a leader so charismatic that he can rally a nation to,

33
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.290
to war and bin Laden perhaps were lucky,

34
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.970
was not sufficiently charismatic. I, I, I feel like if his writing was better,

35
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.850
if his speeches were better, if his ideas were stronger yeah. Uh,

36
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.440
better, it's like, uh,

37
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.720
more viral and then there would be more people kind of,

38
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.280
um, yeah. Young people uniting around him. So in some, in some sense,

39
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.960
it's almost like accidents of history of just how much charisma,

40
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.280
how much charisma, particular evil person has person like.

41
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.190
<v 0>Bin Laden. I think it's fair. Evil, evil works, I think. Um, so.</v>

42
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.950
<v 1>You think bin Laden is evil. Oh.</v>

43
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.110
<v 0>Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, he was a, a mass murderer. Um, I'm just saying that,</v>

44
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.230
you know, his ideas were, they're more complex than,

45
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.680
than we have tended to acknowledge. Um, they had,

46
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.040
they have a wider potential resonance than we would acknowledge. I mean,

47
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.720
and also, I guess what, I'm the just one fundamental point is that, um,

48
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.280
thinking about the complexity of bin Laden is also a way of removing him from

49
00:03:17.281 --> 00:03:20.230
Islam. Um, he is not an Islamic thinker.

50
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:25.190
He is a cosmopolitan thinker who plays in all kinds of

51
00:03:25.191 --> 00:03:29.390
modern ideologies, which have proven to mobilize people in the past. Right. So,

52
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.630
um, you know, antisemitism, um, populism, environmentalism,

53
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.470
and the kind of, and the, the urging to like, you know,

54
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.740
do something a about humanity, do something about suffering.

55
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.140
That's why I think the actual,

56
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.420
you ask about like what motivates people to do this kind of stuff.

57
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.180
I think that's why if one goes below the level of leadership,

58
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.820
and this is being reported, if you look at the,

59
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.100
the trial ongoing now in Paris of, uh,

60
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:56.420
the Lon murders, I think, um,

61
00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.330
the court allowed some discussion of the background rounds of the accused and

62
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:05.410
they come from different backgrounds. But if there's any common bond,

63
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:07.810
it's kind of that they had some background in,

64
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.370
in petty crime famously that in the seven, seven bombings in London,

65
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.770
the metropolitan police, you know, the UK authorities looked at all those guys.

66
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.080
And what people want is idea that like, they must be very pious.

67
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.600
They must be, you know, super Islamic to do this kind of stuff.

68
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.960
They must be fanatical, true believers.

69
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.720
But what they found with those guys was that some were

70
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.880
nominally Muslim, some went to mosques, some didn't, um,

71
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.430
some were single young guys with like criminal backgrounds. Some,

72
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.750
you know, were like, sorry, they were, you know,

73
00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:49.110
kind of misfits who never succeeded in anything. Uh, but others had, you know,

74
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.110
at least one thing had a wife and family who he, you know,

75
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.430
widow owed and orphaned. And so there's no, I mean, for policing, I mean,

76
00:04:56.431 --> 00:04:57.550
if you're looking at to that lens,

77
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.260
there is no kind of typology there will predict who will become violent.

78
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.980
And that's why I think we have to move beyond thinking about religious

79
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.660
argumentation narrowly or by itself, and think about things like geopolitics,

80
00:05:10.661 --> 00:05:14.740
think about how people respond to inequality, you know, the,

81
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.660
the existential threat of, of cry of, of, you know, climate crisis of,

82
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.890
um, a whole host of matters and,

83
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.690
and think about this is a mode of political contestation. I mean,

84
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.970
it's violent one, it's one I can condemn 'em it is evil, right? But it,

85
00:05:28.971 --> 00:05:31.090
these are people that are, they're trying to be political.

86
00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:34.530
They're trying to change things in some way. It's not narrowly about like,

87
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.530
I don't wanna impose Surey law on you. You know, you must wear a veil,

88
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.360
you must eat this kind of food. It's, it's not that kill,

89
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.600
but what one another quick thought about your interesting claim about charisma

90
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.480
in this? I think that the one self-limiting feature of this subculture

91
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.760
is that definitely, you know, I mentioned the, an of,

92
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.040
of not wanting to be seen and that the,

93
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.840
the kind of invisibility is a productive force of a power,

94
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.160
you know, which a colleague of mine who knows ancient history far better than I,

95
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.520
you know, said, oh, this is, you know, when she looked at,

96
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.000
at MI Lomar initially, or we come up in Laden, I mean,

97
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:17.990
this kind of studied posture of staying in the shadows

98
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.590
yeah. Is also a source of authority potentially because it, it, um,

99
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.470
it invites the idea and it's partly dictatorships do this. Well, I mean,

100
00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.710
it invites the idea that someone's working and maybe it's,

101
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.070
it's the basis for a lot of Q Andon or other conspiracy today that someone's

102
00:06:33.071 --> 00:06:35.670
working behind the scenes and things are gonna go the right way.

103
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.260
You can't see it, it,

104
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.900
but that's almost preferable because you can kind of feel it.

105
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.460
And so not having someone out front can maybe maybe more effective than having

106
00:06:46.461 --> 00:06:47.580
someone out in front constantly.

107
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:49.733
<v 1>Maybe, maybe.</v>

108
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.540
<v 0>And then the whole bin Laden, you know, Omar thing. Like you can't see me,</v>

109
00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.500
or if you look at, you know, bin Laden's photographs and his video stuff,

110
00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.650
I mean, he's, he's coy. Uh,

111
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.050
some observers have noted that he's kind of effeminate.

112
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.250
He doesn't strike this kind of masculine. He's not ACE,

113
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.090
he's not a Hitler macho. I'm standing my dumping, my chest.

114
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.330
He's not doing the theatrical chin. You know, mm-hmm,

115
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:16.370
&lt;affirmative&gt; the theater people tell us is so aggressive. Um, you know, or.

116
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.280
<v 1>Chin what chin up is, oh, I saw.</v>

117
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.320
<v 0>A great, uh, BBC theater person. It was kind of a,</v>

118
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.760
it was a makeover show about how to become a better.

119
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.960
<v 1>Oh, no, uh, a powerful, uh, yeah. Leader authoritarian figure.</v>

120
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.400
<v 0>No, just how to, how to like, get ahead in life and then, oh, okay, cool.</v>

121
00:07:34.401 --> 00:07:36.840
And just, and just like about acting like how you, you can act differently.

122
00:07:36.841 --> 00:07:41.590
Right. So it was, it was BBC, um, and this woman claimed that, um,

123
00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.990
you know, seeking your chin out, like a wrestler does, right.

124
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.190
Is the most like male to male. I love this kind.

125
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.470
<v 1>Of most aggressive, hilarious analysis that people have about.</v>

126
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:51.950
<v 0>Power, but.</v>

127
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.590
<v 1>Watch the chin, watch the chin. It's the same as analyzing,</v>

128
00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:59.780
like in wrestling styles that win or fighting or so on.

129
00:07:59.781 --> 00:08:01.540
There's so many ways to do well. The chin, I.

130
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.620
<v 0>Mean, the Chan is a, could be interesting verbal gesture. And I, uh,</v>

131
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:10.900
I've watched enough MIS footage for my classes to try to pick the right moment.

132
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.060
And the chin is, is all about the chin. So, and I have.

133
00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:19.020
<v 1>Watched human beings and human nature enough to know that there's more to a man,</v>

134
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:21.730
a powerful man than a chin. Yeah.

135
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:23.810
<v 0>No, no. I'm saying no, I'm saying it's an active aggression.</v>

136
00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:24.560
I'm not saying it's.

137
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.890
<v 1>It's one of the many tools in the toolkit.</v>

138
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.890
<v 0>Yeah, sure. So she definitely, it's not, that's not all about the chin,</v>

139
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.210
but it's, it's a, but.

140
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:32.850
<v 1>That's what I'm trying to tell you about bin LA.</v>

141
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:37.970
I don't think he was deliberate enough with the way he presents himself, but he.

142
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:40.010
<v 0>What, what I'm saying about bin Laden that makes him different from these other</v>

143
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.120
characters, is it because he played it being the scholar,

144
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.560
he played it being a figure of, of modesty and humility.

145
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.960
And that meant that he was often again, if you watch his visuals, I mean, yes,

146
00:08:52.961 --> 00:08:56.720
there's one video of him firing a gun, but if you watch how he moved,

147
00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:01.560
how he wouldn't look at people directly, how his face was almost, I mean,

148
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:05.880
he appears to be incredibly shy. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; he saw spoken, you know,

149
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:09.280
his voice was low. He attempted to be poetic. Right.

150
00:09:09.281 --> 00:09:13.200
So it wasn't a warrior kind of image that he tried to project of like a tough

151
00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:17.070
guy. It was I'm, I'm demure, I'm humble.

152
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:21.750
I'm, you know, I'm, I'm offering you this message and that, and, and that the,

153
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:26.710
the appeal that he was going for was to see, um, to,

154
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:30.950
you know, to project himself as a scholar whose knowledge and humility,

155
00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:32.350
the whole package carried with it,

156
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:37.380
an authenticity and a valor that would animate,

157
00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.460
inspire people to commit act of violence. Right.

158
00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.620
It's a different kind of like logic of like, yes, go and kill. Right. So he.

159
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:48.180
<v 1>He put, he presented himself in contrast to the imperialist</v>

160
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.100
kind of, um, macho power.

161
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.380
<v 0>Powers, whatever. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So.</v>

162
00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.170
<v 1>That's just yet another way of, yeah.</v>

163
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.650
And you have to have facial hair or hair of different kindness recognized.

164
00:09:59.651 --> 00:10:02.690
We had a very recognizable look too, or at least later in life.

165
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.530
<v 0>Yeah. No, he, he, he tried to look apart. Um, yeah.</v>

166
00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:07.590
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

167
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:12.330
But I'm saying more fortunate that whatever calculation that he was making,

168
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.970
he was not more, um, effective,

169
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.760
but I mean, there's,

170
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:24.200
the world is full of terrorist organizations and we're fortunate to

171
00:10:24.201 --> 00:10:25.034
the degree,

172
00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:30.120
any one of them does not have an incredibly charismatic leader that obtains

173
00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.800
the kind of power that's very difficult to,

174
00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.600
to manage at the geopolitical.

175
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.110
<v 0>Level. Yeah. We, and we credit the publics, you know, who don't,</v>

176
00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:42.030
who don't bind into that. Right. Who see through this, we credit the,

177
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:47.030
the critics, you know, um, barely on going much to nine 11 itself.

178
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:53.470
One of the problems was that us government officials kept kind of leaning on

179
00:10:53.471 --> 00:10:54.304
Muslims to,

180
00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:59.660
to condemn this as if all Muslims shared some collective responsibility

181
00:10:59.661 --> 00:11:02.660
or culpability. And in fact, um,

182
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.900
dozens of scholars and organizations, hundreds condemn this,

183
00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.820
but their condemnations never quite made it out, but it created attention where,

184
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.100
you know, if you wore a veil,

185
00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:18.170
you must spend one of them and you must be on team bin Laden. And lot of the,

186
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:22.050
you know, I think a lot of the popular islands and discrimination and,

187
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:27.370
and profiling came out of that urge to see a oneness, which,

188
00:11:27.371 --> 00:11:29.490
you know, bin, bin Laden projected, right. He wanted to say,

189
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:33.290
we are one community. You know, if you are a Muslim, you must be with me. Right.

190
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.730
But I think the that's where the,

191
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:40.440
the diversity of Muslim communities became important because outside of small

192
00:11:40.441 --> 00:11:42.720
pockets, I mean, they didn't, they didn't accept his leadership. Right.

193
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.080
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; people wore t-shirts in some countries. I mean,

194
00:11:45.081 --> 00:11:47.280
non Muslims wore t-shirts cuz he was like, he stuck it to the Americans.

195
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.280
So mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; in Latin America. People are like, yeah, that was sad.

196
00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.840
But you know, finally,

197
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.080
I mean there was a kind of shot in Florida in that moment. Yeah.

198
00:11:55.081 --> 00:11:58.440
International it's like SHA Guvera or somebody like that. SHA yeah. Chases.

199
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.800
The other character in uh Al's book. Yeah, yeah. That's right. That's right.

200
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.480
It's.

201
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.400
<v 1>Just a simple, it's not exactly what he believed exactly.</v>

202
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.640
Or the cruelty of actions he took. Right.

203
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:10.960
It's more like he stood for an idea of revolution versus authority.

204
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.093
<v 0>That's right.</v>

205
00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.510
It's that's and that's a great way to understand bin modernism and the whole

206
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:21.110
phenomenon. But it, I think looking at the big picture, it's also, you wonder,

207
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:25.150
you know, will that ever end, right. I mean, is that, I mean, that's the,

208
00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:30.270
the risk of being a kind of hyper power, um, like the us where you in,

209
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:35.260
in assisting on a kind of uni world in 2001, 2002, 2003,

210
00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:40.060
I think that created, um, an almost irresistible target,

211
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.900
you know, wherever the us wanted to exert itself, militarily.
