00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.850
<v 0>The guys I hung out with actually wore me out.</v>

2
00:00:04.851 --> 00:00:06.050
Cause they wanted to go out every night.

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.330
They wanted to party every night we had drinking. Yep.

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.570
We had discussions about alcohol. I mean, it was,

5
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.370
Pakistan is famous for its drinking. It's drinking, you know, it's.

6
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.730
<v 1>It's something to look forward to. So I, I do wanna travel to that part of the,</v>

7
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.250
when, when was the last time you were in that part of the world? Early.

8
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.000
<v 0>Two thousands. Well then mid 2000, uh, 2000.</v>

9
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.440
<v 1>Tens. So wait, so, uh, by the way, we're drinking vodka, what,</v>

10
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:30.400
what's the per I mean, that kinda choice.

11
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.400
<v 0>Is Pakistan has incorporated vodka as, as the, um, the choice.</v>

12
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.040
Um &lt;laugh&gt; and that, and it informs, you know, and it's, but,

13
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.880
but the fascinating thing you and as a student is what you're observing as an

14
00:00:41.881 --> 00:00:46.750
non Muslim, you know, I'm, I'm a non Russian I'm, this is all, you know,

15
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.470
culturally new to me. And I'm, you know, a student of all that, right.

16
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.950
As a greatest student doing my work there. So you're like the.

17
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.990
<v 1>Jane Goodall of vodka in Russia. That's right. Just observing.</v>

18
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.310
<v 0>That's right. Studying. Yeah. Yeah. And then, then you, you get the,</v>

19
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.550
you get the Soma gone, the grass vodka, you get, you know,

20
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.260
I have had some long Heights on the Kazakhstan frontier. Yeah.

21
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.140
That I'm not proud of. Um, &lt;laugh&gt;, you know, but you.

22
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.700
<v 1>Got to know that people and some of them from, from, from.</v>

23
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.300
<v 0>That, but, but intellectually. So, so the thing, I mean, the, the,</v>

24
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.940
the fascinating thing there was that, and just as a, I mean, there,

25
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.660
there there's a whole, yeah, I'm in historian. Right. But there,

26
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.090
there are great contributions by, you know,

27
00:01:25.091 --> 00:01:28.210
anthropologists and graphers who who've gone across the planet and tried to

28
00:01:28.211 --> 00:01:31.170
understand how Muslims understand the tradition, a different context.

29
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.730
So many Ecks will say, you know, um,

30
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.650
this is part of our national culture to drink any as we please, right.

31
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.610
And yet I'm a very developed Muslim.

32
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.680
<v 2>And so of course you can encounter other Muslim communities who won't touch</v>

33
00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:50.960
alcohol. Right. But it's become kind of, I think it's very much, um, you know,

34
00:01:50.961 --> 00:01:53.680
Soviet culture left a, a deep impression in each of these places.

35
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.560
And so there are ways of thinking ways of, of performing ways of,

36
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.760
you know, enjoying oneself that are shared across Soviet and former Soviet space

37
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.760
to this day. Right.

38
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.430
<v 1>And you very, and also bought Muslims in the Soviet union. That's right. Uh,</v>

39
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.990
there's an article that, uh, there's a paywall,

40
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.110
so I couldn't read it and I really want to read it.

41
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.390
<v 0>Is, uh, happy to.</v>

42
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.710
<v 1>Share it with you. Yeah. Um, Moscow and the mosque or yeah. Something like that.</v>

43
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.550
Right, right. Um, by the way, just another tangent on a tangent. Yeah. Uh,

44
00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:28.140
so I bought all your books. Love 'em very much. Thank you.

45
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.820
One of the reasons I bought them and read many parts is, uh,

46
00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:36.540
because they're easy to buy unlike articles. Okay.

47
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.540
Every single website has a pay wall. Yeah. Yeah. So it's, it's very, I hear,

48
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.260
I'm sorry. Very frustrating to read brilliance scholars such as yourself. No,

49
00:02:44.261 --> 00:02:48.170
no, no. Uh, I wish there was one fee I could pay everywhere.

50
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.290
I don't care what that fee is,

51
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.970
where it just allows me to read some of the brilliant writing. No.

52
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.730
<v 0>No. Think I hear you. No,</v>

53
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.490
I think moving toward more kind of open source formatting stuff,

54
00:02:58.491 --> 00:03:00.640
I think is what a lot of journals are, are thinking about now.

55
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:04.480
And I think it's definitely for the kind of democratization of knowledge and

56
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:05.180
scholarship.

57
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.480
That's definitely an important thing that we should all think about.

58
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.040
And I think, um, you know, we need to exert pressure on these publishers to,

59
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.000
to do that. So I appreciate that this is what I'm doing here. Yeah. Yeah. Good,

60
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.800
good. Yeah, no, I appreciate it.
