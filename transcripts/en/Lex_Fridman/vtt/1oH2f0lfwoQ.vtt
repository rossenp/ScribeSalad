1
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.550
<v 0>Taking the story forward, uh, the months leading up to his assassination,</v>

2
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.530
what, what, uh, w what do you understand why he was assassinated?

3
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.330
W w who are the players involved? Maybe.

4
00:00:17.331 --> 00:00:18.410
Could you have stopped it?

5
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.870
<v 1>Well, I'll tell you,</v>

6
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.280
after I saw Reagan's face on the television saying we have the absolute proof,

7
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.980
the phone rang, and it would Barry.

8
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.070
I hadn't heard from him in a couple of years. And he said,

9
00:00:31.071 --> 00:00:34.790
I'm coming out tonight. Roger and oh boy.

10
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.400
So, uh, he came out and he said, I'll meet you in this, uh, French restaurant.

11
00:00:40.401 --> 00:00:41.540
I don't even know it in Santa Barbara.

12
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.310
And I walked in there's about 20 or 30 people in there. And he was all 30,

13
00:00:46.311 --> 00:00:51.080
40 years old women, wood, plastic, or leather skirts,

14
00:00:51.081 --> 00:00:54.530
and me and their blue jeans. And I looked around and Barry was at the back.

15
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.460
He was leaned up and he'd gained weight. And I walked up and I said, Barry,

16
00:00:58.461 --> 00:01:01.100
you wired. He said, no. I said, well,

17
00:01:01.101 --> 00:01:04.520
I'm not going to talk the DEA agents. He said, every one of them.

18
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.030
<v 0>Uh, with jeans and skirts, I, like.</v>

19
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.680
<v 1>I said, well, Barry, almost at you. And you just talked to me, but in,</v>

20
00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:17.030
tell me what's on your mind.

21
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.450
And you sit there and he just went to token and he told me about,

22
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.170
he was left holding the bag. And it, uh.

23
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.790
<v 0>What do you mean by that? Like that nobody's supporting them.</v>

24
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.160
<v 1>I know that he was, um, and I don't know this. I mean, this is just what,</v>

25
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.800
what happened, uh, putting it all together,

26
00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:41.480
that he had some CIA buddies that was pretending we go into

27
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.960
supply all over north wind arms. And with that,

28
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.540
you can land cocaine back here by the tongue.

29
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.850
So he's taking his little planes and putting some AK 40 sevens and maybe

30
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.080
ammunition or whatever, and takes it down to the conscious, uh, against the,

31
00:01:58.081 --> 00:02:02.870
you come in Easter party of Nicaragua where we've been landed and Oliver

32
00:02:02.871 --> 00:02:07.490
north was involved in this. So, uh, when, uh, when all that,

33
00:02:07.491 --> 00:02:11.720
and so his CIA buddies was certainly involved. We know that they were,

34
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.450
and Barry had been in the CIA earlier when he first got out of school. So,

35
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.710
uh, when, when, um, as I say,

36
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.910
the hit the fan, they all fled and left Barry holding the bag, the.

37
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.830
<v 0>CIA and the DEA. Yeah.</v>

38
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.970
<v 1>Or no, not the DEA, the CIA DEA, what Nana CIA was,</v>

39
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.030
was still in that cocaine, bringing it in. And, uh.

40
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.650
<v 0>Just to clarify, what's Iran, Contra scandal.</v>

41
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.120
What was the alleged involvement of the CIA in,

42
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.030
uh, in using drug trade to fund things? What do you know,

43
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.080
what do you think is true? What should we know?

44
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.490
<v 1>No,</v>

45
00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.370
what I knew was true that Barry was taking a small amount of arms back to

46
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:05.170
central America and giving them to whoever Oliver north group group,

47
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.270
where, who is all over north,

48
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:10.600
who was a Colonel that got implemented normal pro government down.

49
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.800
And so they said, all right,

50
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.390
we're getting a gun from Iran and we're taking cocaine to pay for. Yeah.

51
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.330
Since Congress won't give us money to fight this war, we go,

52
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.070
now we're going to circumvent it. So that was, that was a whole thing.

53
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.640
So.

54
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.020
<v 0>It was a CIS effort to circumvent the funding</v>

55
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:33.250
mechanisms of government by selling drugs. Yes.

56
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.680
<v 1>But it was a handful of Renegade,</v>

57
00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:40.450
CIA agents that would Barry's friends that was making a load

58
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.340
load of money. Tons of it. Come up. If you would like to read the book, uh,

59
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:48.760
the big white lie, the CIA and the crack cocaine epidemic,

60
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.990
the CIA put according to this, uh, uh,

61
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.400
the book and Michael Lavonne. I didn't remember his name.

62
00:03:57.401 --> 00:04:02.350
Last time I talked, uh, wrote that book and he was a, uh, head CIA agent.

63
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.450
Uh, he was the head DEA agent that exposed this and the CIA tried to kill him.

64
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.240
And he says they put crack cocaine. They developed their,

65
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.690
their chemistry developed crack. And they put it in every country,

66
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.960
every city in the United States on one weekend. So, uh,

67
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.630
they were bringing it up by the tones and that's for sure.

68
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.890
And Barry was bringing it.

69
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.920
<v 0>Okay. Can I ask you a small tangent question?</v>

70
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.410
Do you think the public should trust the CIA and the

71
00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:30.244
DEA?

72
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.410
Do you think they're mostly good people that are carrying out a good mission

73
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.850
because this kind of makes it sound like there's Renegade agents that are just

74
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.420
doing whatever the hell they want and with, uh,

75
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.460
sometimes no regard for human life.

76
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.880
<v 1>Well, that's certainly true, but that's not everybody in there.</v>

77
00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:52.990
That's just sometime you get a few policemen in the department that do these

78
00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:56.620
things. I don't believe, I believe that our government is, is good.

79
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.190
I think we've got some fools running it. I don't know how we get them there, but

80
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.610
I don't want to think. I know. Okay.

81
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.590
<v 0>So what was Barry's involvement here.</v>

82
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.200
<v 1>And very, very lean back in that chair. And he told me that, you know, he'd,</v>

83
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:12.070
uh,

84
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.810
he got caught with one and a half tons and a belt it in the runway in

85
00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:18.790
Nicaragua and, uh,

86
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.840
had cameras flashing inside and out.

87
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.290
And then he flew it back to homestead with, with an agent there.

88
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:30.400
And he brought the agent over, um, Jake Jacobson,

89
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.850
really nice fellow. I think he was a crop duster and we'd got along,

90
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.020
had been on the right side. And, uh, so we, uh, we sit there and drink Chevys,

91
00:05:38.021 --> 00:05:41.500
Regal. And until I got pied and, and, uh, Barry told me about it.

92
00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:43.900
He said that he went to see ed would meet. She flew his,

93
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.760
he got out on bail and he flew his Learjet up to Washington and went in to see

94
00:05:48.761 --> 00:05:52.360
the attorney general Edwin Meese. And they run him out of the office.

95
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.550
The next day, he went back and said,

96
00:05:54.551 --> 00:05:59.030
I have absolute proof that the CIA is bringing tons of cocaine.

97
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.480
Are they running Sonya cocaine into the United States?

98
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.170
And it would mean putting moved with this agent Jacobson. I believe it was.

99
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.890
And they went down and got one and a half tons. And on the way back,

100
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.260
they bailed it in and Pablo Escobar and some of the other ones on general there

101
00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:19.250
in Nicaragua, you can see him toting it from one point to the other ship.

102
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.910
And the book call the big nose, uh, Kings of cocaine.

103
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.600
It's got a mention the me too. And also the other one has, uh,

104
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:27.321
mentioned to me in,

105
00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:31.730
it said I'm in more files for the DEA than Noriega.

106
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.250
<v 0>So who was wanting to get rid of Barry? Is it, is it the,</v>

107
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.400
who wanted to get rid of Barry Moore, the cartels or the CIA.

108
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.370
<v 1>The cartel, but, uh, show Barry leaned back. And he, and he,</v>

109
00:06:45.371 --> 00:06:49.280
he told me the story and the tears came down between his fingers and he put his

110
00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:52.520
hands over his eyes and he said, I couldn't do it. Roger.

111
00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:55.520
I just couldn't do three life sentences. So I've told him everything.

112
00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:57.710
I went to Congress and I've testified before Congress.

113
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.880
And he testified before Congress, all these things that he'd done. And he said,

114
00:07:01.881 --> 00:07:05.810
I told them all about you, but you're under my umbrella.

115
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.350
You got to testify with me before grand jury and Miami.

116
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.340
And so the guy said, you can come down. The DEA agent said,

117
00:07:13.341 --> 00:07:15.890
you can come down tomorrow with Marie first class,

118
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.930
or I'll take you down in chains.

119
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.740
And if you don't testify with Barry,

120
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.290
the only place you'll ever see your wife and family again,

121
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.870
is in a federal prison visiting room. Was that.

122
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.700
<v 0>A difficult conversation? Oh.</v>

123
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.370
<v 1>Looking no, no. My eyes, my guts was just like ice water.</v>

124
00:07:31.371 --> 00:07:35.510
I can't testify against my friends. I just can't do it.

125
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.200
How am I going to do it? I just, I can't work with people.

126
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:41.540
And he was honest with me. How am I going to testify against them?

127
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.380
I can't spend the rest of my life in a federal prison. What on earth?

128
00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:49.730
What a mess, Barry. You've got me into. So, uh,

129
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:50.540
is that a kind of.

130
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.410
<v 0>Betrayal there?</v>

131
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.950
<v 1>Yes, but it still, I wish he left me out of it.</v>

132
00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.430
I don't understand him getting his, it in such a mess that he told,

133
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.000
because if the CIA and whoever else was behind him, betrayed him,

134
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.910
then he's going to tell everything if you, so I says, all right,

135
00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:12.680
I'll be to Miami. So Mara and I flew down first-class and I,

136
00:08:12.681 --> 00:08:15.740
and I went to a lawyer, one of the biggest lawyers in Miami, and I said, man,

137
00:08:15.741 --> 00:08:19.580
I am in a mass. This fellow has told everything.

138
00:08:19.581 --> 00:08:24.150
And I've got to say something, but I'm not a snitch, man. I mean, I can have,

139
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.340
what can I do? And he said, well, being a snitch is like being pregnant.

140
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:29.600
You either are, or you're not.

141
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.120
And he says, I don't represent snitches. But if you want to fight this case,

142
00:08:38.121 --> 00:08:42.200
I'll do it for $600,000. And when my face turned red, well,

143
00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:45.230
I'm not a snitch. He said, well, that's what you're talking about. He said,

144
00:08:45.231 --> 00:08:45.861
let me tell you something.

145
00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:49.610
If you go in there and say one thing and signed that paper and you don't tell

146
00:08:49.611 --> 00:08:52.280
them everything, you know? Yeah.

147
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.230
Then they will convict you of everything you've ever done. And you've told them,

148
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.580
so you can't do it. So, uh, I said, Barry,

149
00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:03.570
I'm having trouble with a lawyer. Give it a go tomorrow. Let's go. So,

150
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.390
all right, use my lawyer. And he gave me his cards, a lawyer's card.

151
00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:11.220
So Mara and I went to the festival restaurant that night and Barry and Debbie

152
00:09:11.221 --> 00:09:13.590
came in, she would dress pretty. And Barry was,

153
00:09:13.591 --> 00:09:16.950
and so we had already bought finished. So we had dessert together and I said,

154
00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:20.160
Barry, they're going to kill you friend. He said, no, I ain't going to kill me.

155
00:09:20.161 --> 00:09:24.090
So and so such and such, he's gone. And this, another hush bear,

156
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:29.040
they going to kill you, man. Ain't no, you can't deny it. And ah,

157
00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:33.090
you're nauseous. I didn't tell him I want him to testify. So I hugged his neck.

158
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.090
I really like, and we fled to Brazil,

159
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.860
but I took Mari and the children went to Brazil.

160
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:39.990
<v 0>So he decided there, you're not going to find.</v>

161
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:43.080
<v 1>You and storm weren't going to die. I didn't know what I could do.</v>

162
00:09:43.081 --> 00:09:45.620
I talked to her lawyer. I mean, I just didn't, I didn't know what,

163
00:09:45.621 --> 00:09:49.530
what I could do, but the best in Miami said what he told me.

164
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.940
So I had to go.

165
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.770
<v 0>And he went to Brazil.</v>

166
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:57.150
We went to have a conversation with anybody at the cartel. I mean,

167
00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.680
that's such an interesting moment that test the man's character

168
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.100
to not snitch.

169
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.600
And did you have a conversation with anybody? No.

170
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.640
<v 1>Pablo with no about it. Like.</v>

171
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.280
<v 0>So it's just understood.</v>

172
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:15.750
<v 1>I just didn't couldn't do it.</v>

173
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.210
<v 0>But how many men, like you are there?</v>

174
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.290
<v 1>Not many.</v>

175
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.920
I had all my friends testified against me at 11 friends and every one of them

176
00:10:22.921 --> 00:10:25.830
put their finger up. Roger did it now I was facing life,

177
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.590
continuing criminal enterprise care. Well, you couldn't do it.

178
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.513
I just couldn't do it.

179
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.530
<v 0>You ever get respect from the cartels for that? From the floor?</v>

180
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:36.720
<v 1>They was all the time I got back and stuff.</v>

181
00:10:36.721 --> 00:10:38.220
They owed me money and I can't get it.

182
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.900
<v 0>Oh, well that's about money. I just mean about human beings.</v>

183
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.910
<v 1>Oh, I think so. I've been back down there and I've been welcomed. I have my, uh,</v>

184
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.550
my contact and uh, when I was in Brazil, I was trying to get this money.

185
00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.040
They owe me three and a half million dollars.

186
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.440
So I called up there and he was gonna pay me. Oh,

187
00:10:55.441 --> 00:10:59.010
I got 600,000 today and I'll get you some more tomorrow.

188
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:03.660
And then the next week I called, Hey, Hey guys, great news. Great news. Barry.

189
00:11:03.661 --> 00:11:08.340
Seal's been killed. So, oh no. And I went back to the hotel.

190
00:11:08.341 --> 00:11:13.140
We was up in Northern part of Brazil. And what was it? Muddy? Uh,

191
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:18.480
yeah. And, uh, so I went back and I told Mari and Miriam and, uh,

192
00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.630
and they cried and I cried. I really cried. How.

193
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.790
<v 0>How's that great news from the cartel?</v>

194
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.760
<v 1>Well, now there is no case against me and him and them.</v>

195
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.430
<v 0>Do you know who killed them? Yes.</v>

196
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:34.770
<v 1>I'll tell you about that story. On the first load I did. I landed in, uh,</v>

197
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:39.600
at a banana plantation and it was raining and it was a muddy strip clay.

198
00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:43.530
And they put the 300 kilos of cocaine in, in the ugliest man.

199
00:11:43.531 --> 00:11:47.370
You could imagine named Rinaldo, got in there with a Mac 10 and, uh,

200
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.320
he was making sure I took it to Louisiana.

201
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.980
<v 0>So this is many years before. Yeah.</v>

202
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.440
<v 1>Couple of years before. So anyway, he, uh, uh,</v>

203
00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.940
we took off and the mud got up in the wheel wheel. So,

204
00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.060
so thick until the wheels wouldn't come up. Well,

205
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:08.050
I'm going 200 miles an hour instead of 300 miles a wheel coming out. Well,

206
00:12:08.051 --> 00:12:10.330
I can't go back there if I do.

207
00:12:10.331 --> 00:12:13.720
I'm going to be in the same situation till the sun dries it out in a few days.

208
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.000
And so, but in beliefs,

209
00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:19.900
I had a runway that we'd been used for $10,000 used to refuel.

210
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:25.360
So I told the guy, listen, we got to land in beliefs to refuel and no, no, no.

211
00:12:25.361 --> 00:12:29.800
He put to make 10 and I'll shoot you, go ahead. Food. You're going to die too.

212
00:12:29.801 --> 00:12:32.020
So it was in a term. So.

213
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.120
<v 0>He wasn't just ugly. He was also.</v>

214
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:37.690
<v 1>He was a bad, bad killer. And so, uh,</v>

215
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.030
he's the one to actually kill a Barry.

216
00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:46.420
The one that went up on the first load with me and are

217
00:12:46.421 --> 00:12:49.630
now though, and he's doing, he's just a killer. Yeah.

218
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.640
He doing life in Louisiana.

219
00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:56.050
<v 0>Who, uh, is it known who made that decision?</v>

220
00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.660
<v 1>Uh, the younger, uh, Ochoa brother.</v>

221
00:12:58.661 --> 00:13:03.520
I understand Favio which wasn't paid for the hit. I don't know that,

222
00:13:03.521 --> 00:13:06.400
but that's what I've heard. And it's probably sounds about right. He's,

223
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:10.390
he's done in Jesup, Georgia doing a long, long time.

224
00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:13.420
I think he's about to get out. He's been in 30 years or whatever.
