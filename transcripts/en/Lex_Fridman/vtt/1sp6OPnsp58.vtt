00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.680
<v 0>So not be talking just about ideas,</v>

2
00:00:05.681 --> 00:00:10.280
but the actually be expressing the idea. Is there, you know, somebody in the,

3
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.280
maybe you can comment, there's a guy, uh, his YouTube channel is three blue,

4
00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:20.240
one brown grant Anderson. He does that masterfully well, absolutely.

5
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.150
Of, of visualizing of expressing a, the idea and then talking about it as well,

6
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.190
back and forth. Uh, what do you, what do you think about grant.

7
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.590
<v 1>It's? It's fantastic. I mean, the flowering of math,</v>

8
00:00:31.591 --> 00:00:35.870
YouTube is like such a wonderful thing because you know, math teaching,

9
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.510
there's so many different venues through which we can teach people math.

10
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.860
There's the traditional one, right? Well, what, where I'm in a classroom with,

11
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.220
you know, depending on the class, it could be 30 people,

12
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.340
it could be a hundred people. It could, God help me be a 500 people.

13
00:00:51.341 --> 00:00:53.460
If it's like the big calculus lecture or whatever it may be.

14
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.541
And there's sort of some,

15
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:57.660
but there's some set of people of that order of magnitude and I'm with them for,

16
00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:01.140
we have a long time I'm with them for a whole semester and I can ask them to do

17
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.140
homework. And we talk together.

18
00:01:02.141 --> 00:01:04.450
We have office hours that they have one-on-one questions, lot, blah,

19
00:01:04.451 --> 00:01:06.130
that's like a very high level of engagement,

20
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.010
but how many people am I actually hitting at a time? Like not that many. Right.

21
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:12.970
Um, and you can,

22
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.050
and there's kind of an inverse relationship where the more enga the,

23
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.650
the fewer people you're talking to,

24
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.050
the more engagement you can ask for the ultimate of course,

25
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.400
is like the mentorship relation of like a &lt;affirmative&gt; PhD advisor and a

26
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.360
graduate student where you spend a lot of one on one time together for like,

27
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.400
you know, three to five years and of the ultimate high level of engagement

28
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.560
to one person mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, um, you know, books I can,

29
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.680
this can get to a lot more people that are ever gonna sit in my classroom and

30
00:01:44.681 --> 00:01:46.790
you spend, and like, uh,

31
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.590
however many hours it takes to read a book, uh, somebody like three blue,

32
00:01:51.591 --> 00:01:55.350
one brown or number file, or, um, people like VI Hart. I mean,

33
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.790
YouTube let's face, it has bigger reach than a book.

34
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.870
Like there's YouTube videos that have many, many, many more views than like,

35
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.070
you know, any hardback book,

36
00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:09.020
like not written by a Kardashian or an Obama is gonna sell. Right. So that's,

37
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.340
I mean, um, any, and, and then, you know,

38
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.460
those are, you know, some of them are like longer 20 minutes long.

39
00:02:17.461 --> 00:02:19.540
Some of 'em are five minutes long, but they're, you know, they're shorter.

40
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.513
And then even so looked,

41
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.620
looked like Virginia Chan was a wonderful category theorist in Chicago. I mean,

42
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.850
she was on, I think the daily show or is, I mean, she was, you know, mm-hmm,

43
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:27.710
&lt;affirmative&gt;, she has 30 seconds,

44
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.570
but then there's like 30 seconds to sort of say something about math mathematics

45
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.770
to like untold millions of people. So everywhere along this curve is,

46
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.050
is important.

47
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.530
And one thing I feel like is great right now is that people are just

48
00:02:39.531 --> 00:02:43.170
broadcasting on all the channels because we each have our skills. Right.

49
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.610
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; somehow along the way, like I learned how to write books.

50
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.530
I had this kind of,

51
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.960
of weird life as a writer where I sort of spent a lot of time,

52
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:52.320
like thinking about how to put English words together into sentences and

53
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.160
sentences together into paragraphs, like at length,

54
00:02:55.161 --> 00:02:59.640
which is this kind of like weird specialized skill &lt;laugh&gt; and one thing,

55
00:02:59.641 --> 00:03:02.040
but like sort of being able to make like, you know,

56
00:03:02.041 --> 00:03:06.960
winning good looking eye-catching videos is like a totally different skill.

57
00:03:06.961 --> 00:03:08.680
And, you know, probably, you know, somewhere out there,

58
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:12.360
there's probably sort of some like heavy metal band that's like teaching math

59
00:03:12.361 --> 00:03:15.280
through heavy metal and like using their skills to do that.

60
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:17.120
I hope there is at anyway, their.

61
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.030
<v 0>Music and so on. Yeah. But there is something to the process. I mean,</v>

62
00:03:21.031 --> 00:03:24.150
grant does this especially well, which is

63
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.750
in order to be able to visualize something. Now he writes programs.

64
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.230
So it's programmatic visualization. So like the,

65
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.750
the things he is basically mostly through his, uh, Madam library and,

66
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.140
and Python, everything is drawn on through Python. You have to,

67
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.420
um, you have to truly understand the topic to be able to,

68
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.700
to visualize it in that way and not just understand it,

69
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.660
but really kind of think in a very novel way. It's funny,

70
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.380
cuz I I've spoken with him a couple times, uh,

71
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.290
spoken to him a lot offline as well.

72
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.370
He really doesn't think he's doing anything new,

73
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.330
meaning like he sees himself as very different from maybe like a

74
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.650
researcher, but it feels

75
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.370
to me like he's creating something totally new,

76
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:23.200
like that act of understanding very visualizing is as powerful or

77
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:27.680
has the same kind of inkling of power as does the process of proving something.

78
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.400
You know, it, it just, it doesn't have that clear destination, but it's,

79
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.120
it's pulling out an insight and creating multiple sets of perspective that

80
00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:38.240
arrive at that insight.

81
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.750
<v 1>And to be honest, it's something that it,</v>

82
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.830
I think we haven't quite figured out how to value inside

83
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.310
academic mathematics in the same way.

84
00:04:47.311 --> 00:04:50.350
And this is a bit older that I think we haven't quite figured out how to value

85
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.030
the development of computational infrastructure. You know,

86
00:04:53.031 --> 00:04:56.990
we all have computers as our partners now and people build

87
00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.990
computers that sort of assist and participate in our mathematics.

88
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.500
They build those systems and that's a kind of mathematics too,

89
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.780
but not in the traditional form of proving theorems and writing papers.

90
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.100
But I think it's coming look, I mean, I think, you know, for example,

91
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.820
the Institute for, uh, computational experimental mathematics at brown,

92
00:05:15.821 --> 00:05:19.620
which is like a, you know, it's a NSF funded math Institute,

93
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.810
very much part of sort of traditional math. Yeah.

94
00:05:21.811 --> 00:05:24.970
They did an entire theme semester about visualizing mathematics,

95
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.890
like into the same kind of thing that they would do for like an up and coming

96
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.570
research topic. Like that's pretty cool. So I think there really is buy-in from,

97
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:34.150
uh,

98
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.530
the mathematics community to recognize that this kind of stuff is important and

99
00:05:37.531 --> 00:05:41.970
counts as part of mathematics, like part of what we're actually here to do.

100
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.560
<v 0>Yeah. I'm hoping to see more and more of that from like MIT faculty,</v>

101
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.880
from faculty, from all the, the top universities in the world.
