00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.320
<v 0>So can we, can we talk about myth and religion a little bit? I mean,</v>

2
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.620
can we start at the beginning, which is like, myths,

3
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.260
how are they born? There's this collective intelligence amongst us human beings.

4
00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:21.060
And we seem to create these beautiful ideas that captivate the minds of

5
00:00:21.061 --> 00:00:23.580
millions. How's such a myth born.

6
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.190
<v 1>Great question. Okay. So that brings us to terminology again,</v>

7
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.380
in, um, in my field, we, we definitely, I think,

8
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.270
try not to distinguish between religion. I, this is going to be controversial,

9
00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:40.310
I think between religion and myth,

10
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.880
because we call other cultures,

11
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.010
religions myths, right. And then we call our myths religions.

12
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.540
<v 0>And I guess myth has a bad connotation to it that it's not somehow real. Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.180
<v 1>Now what's interesting is that, um,</v>

14
00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.500
people like Plato who lived thousands of years ago, 2,500 about,

15
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.690
um, basically made this distinction himself within his own culture,

16
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.610
which was Greek. Right?

17
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.170
So Plato is a very famous Greek philosopher and he would say things like this,

18
00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:14.270
he would say that, um,

19
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.820
he would make a distinction between the reality of the one God

20
00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:23.570
or the one he would call it. He didn't call, use the word God,

21
00:01:23.571 --> 00:01:26.630
but he's referencing a divinity of okay.

22
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.020
And he believes in the soul. Okay. So,

23
00:01:30.021 --> 00:01:34.490
but he would also say that the gods and goddesses of the Greeks are just

24
00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:38.690
myths. So even he would make that distinction again, you know,

25
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.960
he would say the population is not too bright.

26
00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:44.300
So they believe in these gods and goddesses,

27
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.460
but he himself is talking to his students and he's basically talking about

28
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.850
forms, you know? So you know, that live in,

29
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.910
seem to live in these other dimensions. Like this table,

30
00:01:55.911 --> 00:01:59.330
let's go back to this table that we're talking, um, around right now,

31
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.380
he would say that this table is the instantiation of the form of table.

32
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.110
And that there's this table that actually exists somewhere.

33
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.770
It's where this place where numbers exist, like the number two. Okay.

34
00:02:09.771 --> 00:02:13.460
So there we use the number two mathematically, therefore it exists,

35
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.710
but have you ever seen a real one? Have you ever seen the real to know? Okay.

36
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.140
So, but where does it exist? So he says that tables.

37
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.650
So he was also talking about things that, you know,

38
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.120
he says are real making a distinction between the

39
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.710
people. And by the way,

40
00:02:30.711 --> 00:02:35.540
he got this from Socrates's his mentor who was killed by Athens,

41
00:02:35.541 --> 00:02:39.320
because he would say such things, people don't like to be told that they,

42
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.510
what they believe in is not real. Right. Yeah.

43
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.040
<v 0>By the way, his idea of the forms is just, you just make me realize how,</v>

44
00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:49.550
like incredible was that somebody like that was able to come up with that.

45
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.410
I mean, that idea became a myth that, uh, the idea of forms, right.

46
00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:56.180
That permeated, uh,

47
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.160
probably the most influential set of ideas in, in,

48
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.400
in the history of philosophy and the history of ideas. Yes.

49
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.040
<v 1>Yeah. He played her, we know him for a reason. Right?</v>

50
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.610
<v 0>Yeah. So let's say that we're not a,</v>

51
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:13.870
it's a gray area between religious and myths and maybe not even. Yeah.

52
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.850
Uh, so what,

53
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.800
how's that idea with like little Play-Doh start and permeate the roll-ups.

54
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.900
<v 1>Oh, how does it happen? Okay. So there are different ways that religions work.</v>

55
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.270
Um, so a lot of people would call the UFO narrative today, like, uh, uh,

56
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.140
and this is what I talk about in my book, like a myth, right. The UFO myth,

57
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.190
but a lot of people believe in it. Okay. So how do these things work? Well,

58
00:03:38.191 --> 00:03:41.340
what I did was I took, um, there's a,

59
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.030
[inaudible] at, um, UC Santa Barbara.

60
00:03:45.031 --> 00:03:48.420
She's a pretty well-known academic who studies religion.

61
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.860
And she has this building block definition of religion, like it builds. Okay.

62
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.000
And so she says, there are, there are,

63
00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.160
there are no religious experiences or mythic experiences.

64
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.500
There are experiences.

65
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.910
And then they get interpreted as religious or mythic. Okay.

66
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.680
And so I, I use that with the UFO narrative.

67
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.730
So I take, um, and I compare it to the religious narrative.

68
00:04:14.731 --> 00:04:18.210
So basically what happens, um, what happens is this,

69
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.160
is that a person generally has a very intense experience. Um,

70
00:04:23.161 --> 00:04:26.700
it could be with something that they see in the sky, uh, being, you know,

71
00:04:26.701 --> 00:04:28.500
that they see, um, you know,

72
00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:30.570
like Moses in the burning Bush or something like that,

73
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.730
they tell other people okay.

74
00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:37.080
And there's other people believe them because they say that guy let's take you.

75
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.250
Okay, Lex. Okay. So you're playing, you know, some of your music,

76
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.770
Jimmy Hendrix shows up out of the blue.

77
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.370
So Jimmy Hendricks who's who does electric church stuff. Right.

78
00:04:47.371 --> 00:04:49.800
The electric church movement. So he shows up.

79
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.760
<v 0>I was sorry for a small tangent. I was, I'm not aware of,</v>

80
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.800
I apologize if I should be, I'm just know how to play all of the songs,

81
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.200
uh, electric church. Is this a thing I know this is a thing.

82
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.100
Yeah. So that was like a philosophy of his or what?

83
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.850
<v 1>Yes, yes. Yes. So he thought he was, it was like a mission for him, like a, me,</v>

84
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.780
like he was a missionary and he was like doing the electric church.

85
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.280
It was through his mission of music that he was actually impacting people

86
00:05:20.281 --> 00:05:23.880
spiritually. And I think you have to agree that his music is really spirited.

87
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.120
<v 0>Wow. That's so cool to know that there's like a philosophy there.</v>

88
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.320
I wonder if he's ever written anything. He's spoken about it many times.

89
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.710
Interesting. To actually do some, some research here. Wow.

90
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.070
As another level of depth. That's awesome. Okay. So.

91
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.240
<v 1>Okay. So say Lex is playing one of his songs,</v>

92
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.380
songs he.

93
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.213
<v 0>Shows up.</v>

94
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.320
<v 1>Oh, that's a hard one. I like castles in the sand. It's a sad one,</v>

95
00:05:49.321 --> 00:05:50.610
but I like it.

96
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.230
<v 0>So I'm playing something.</v>

97
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.090
<v 1>And all of a sudden, boom, just like Elvis does for people. Yeah.</v>

98
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:58.490
Hendricks shows up. All right.

99
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.450
And then you're amazed and they just tells you something that's very,

100
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:05.660
very significant. And he says, you need to tell other people this. Okay.

101
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.160
So then like, okay. Yes. And you start.

102
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:15.050
And because people believe you and because you are a person of, um,

103
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.750
you know, credibility, people believe you.

104
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.590
And so all of a sudden a movement starts, okay. And it's the Hendrix movement.

105
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.340
It's Hendrix too, or something like that. You know, we call it something, uh,

106
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.730
the next iteration of Hendrix, right. Hendrix lives.

107
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.470
But he lives is this vibration. And only Lex can like, you know, can,

108
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.800
can manifest this vibration. Okay. So like, this is,

109
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.930
this is how religion is Starbucks, you know,

110
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.720
excuse your audience who are religious. I'm actually a practicing Catholic.

111
00:06:41.721 --> 00:06:46.520
So this is how religion starts. They start with first off a contact experience.

112
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.420
Uh, not, I mean, not all of them, but a good portion of them. Um,

113
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.520
P some person has an experience that's transcendent sacred to them and they

114
00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:56.810
go and they tell other people,

115
00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:01.070
and then those people tell other people and then something gets written about

116
00:07:01.071 --> 00:07:04.400
it. Okay. And then it becomes, because it's a charismatic movement.

117
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:09.530
People become effected by it. And if, if too many people are affected by it,

118
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:14.240
um, an institution steps in and tries to control the narrative. Uh,

119
00:07:14.241 --> 00:07:18.860
so this is what you'd call the beginning of a religion or a myth,

120
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.420
a very powerful myth. And so it's almost like a star, right? A star is born.

121
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.600
<v 0>When you say institution,</v>

122
00:07:25.601 --> 00:07:29.380
do you mean some other organization that's already powerful,

123
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.070
doesn't want to become, uh, overpowered by this new movement.

124
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:35.200
It's usually governments.

125
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.950
<v 1>Usually. Yeah. So, uh, I have a couple of examples.</v>

126
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.170
I use the example of the Christian Church in my book,

127
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.710
because I'm most familiar with the history of Christianity and, you know,

128
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.280
Christianity was started by this Jewish man.

129
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.690
And it was a movement that, you know, he was a very powerful,

130
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.780
charismatic person. Other people believed in him.

131
00:07:55.781 --> 00:07:59.440
And then his followers talked about him. And then other than, you know,

132
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:03.670
usually early Christians before the

133
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:08.470
three hundreds were generally people who were disenfranchised because he had a

134
00:08:08.471 --> 00:08:12.430
pretty radical idea that, you know, humans should have dignity.

135
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.160
And this was pretty radical during that time.

136
00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:18.220
So women who didn't have dignity and, you know,

137
00:08:18.221 --> 00:08:20.710
slaves who didn't have dignity at the time, um,

138
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:25.510
converted Christianity in droves. And so what happened was that all of a sudden,

139
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:31.120
um, it became this belief system that was undercurrent. And then, uh,

140
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.290
Constantine, um, who was an elite, uh,

141
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:39.940
had an experience and made Christianity to state religion. Um,

142
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.670
by that time there were different forms of Christianity,

143
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.740
probably hundreds of them, well,

144
00:08:44.741 --> 00:08:49.360
most likely and Constantine and the people who

145
00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:53.650
were powerful with him decided that their idea,

146
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:58.160
this is the council of Nicea decided that there was one form and they call it

147
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.360
universal. So the one form of Christianity and this should be it. And so they,

148
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.500
they kind of took out all the other denominations of Christianity and different

149
00:09:07.501 --> 00:09:10.350
forms of it. So you can see that a very,

150
00:09:10.351 --> 00:09:15.090
very powerful set of beliefs put a

151
00:09:15.091 --> 00:09:18.960
culture on fire. Right. And so how did they,

152
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:23.190
they had to deal with that fire somehow. And so they narrativized, it,

153
00:09:23.191 --> 00:09:27.600
they decided how do we interpret this? And they interpreted it as they wished,

154
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:31.710
but that wasn't the only interpretation of Christianity. I have another example,

155
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.580
um, in the Catholic church, um, a lot of times,

156
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.860
and I'm going to use the example of, uh, foul Stina. Um,

157
00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:45.060
she's, um, she's a nun and she's Polish. And, um,

158
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:48.450
I think it was in the early 20th century, if not the 18 hundreds,

159
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:53.490
that she had a very powerful, uh, many experiences actually of,

160
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.500
of Jesus. And she saw Jesus with rays coming out of his,

161
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.520
his heart. And basically she called this, his divine mercy,

162
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:07.680
and it became a devotion in Poland and it spread the Catholic church was

163
00:10:07.681 --> 00:10:09.930
not, not into this at all. Okay.

164
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:15.150
And so they did everything they could to try to suppress Faustino's influence,

165
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.990
which was growing and growing and growing and growing. Okay.

166
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:23.430
And so they were very successful in trying to keep her quiet and she died. Okay.

167
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.260
Years later, John Paul,

168
00:10:25.261 --> 00:10:30.060
the second Polish sainted her and created

169
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:31.890
the divine mercy devotion,

170
00:10:31.891 --> 00:10:35.370
which is worldwide now and millions and millions of people.

171
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.550
But do you see how they, they, you know, completely controlled.

172
00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:43.520
<v 0>So fascinating that it, uh, that it just starts with a single suit. Like I said,</v>

173
00:10:43.521 --> 00:10:45.800
contact experience, experiences, the keyword,

174
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.940
and D is your sense that those experiences are

175
00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:55.220
legitimate. So it's not artificially constructed.

176
00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.580
<v 1>For the most part. There are legitimate experiences that people have.</v>

177
00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.520
Why would someone want to put themselves through what they go through? Like,

178
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:05.480
why would Jesus want to get crucified? I mean, that's a pretty nasty way to die.

179
00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:10.070
Um, you know, why would, [inaudible] bring this upon herself? Um,

180
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.580
the people that I meet who've said that they've seen you a frozen,

181
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:17.300
that most of them don't want to be known because of the ridicule that goes along

182
00:11:17.301 --> 00:11:19.940
with it. So I honestly think that, you know,

183
00:11:19.941 --> 00:11:24.380
there are people who are maybe not stable and we'd like the attention,

184
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.770
but for the most part, normal people don't want this attention.
