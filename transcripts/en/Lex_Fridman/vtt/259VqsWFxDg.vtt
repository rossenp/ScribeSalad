00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.830
<v 0>You're, uh, you got a Nobel prize for, uh, looking out into the,</v>

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.430
trying to reach back into the beginning of the universe,

3
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.430
listening to the gravitational waves. Uh,

4
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.590
but that still doesn't answer the why.

5
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.870
Why are we here beyond just the, yeah, the matter. And antimatter

6
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.060
the philosophical question, the.

7
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.860
<v 1>Philoso philosophical question about the meaning of life.</v>

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.740
I'm probably not really good at. Um, I think that,

9
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.013
um,

10
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.250
The individual meaning, uh, I,

11
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.480
I would say it rather some realistically is whether you've made

12
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.080
a difference, a positive difference, I'd say for anything besides yourself,

13
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.960
uh, meaning you could have been important to other people,

14
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.560
or you could have discovered gravitational waves that matters to other people or

15
00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:03.020
something,

16
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.710
but something beyond just existing on the earth as an individual.

17
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.470
So your life has meaning if you have affected,

18
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.343
um,

19
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.110
either knowledge or people or something beyond yourself,

20
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.420
Do you, it's a simplistic statement, but it's about as good as I, yeah.

21
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.780
<v 0>That's that may in all of its simplicity, it may be very true.</v>

22
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.500
Do you think about, um, does it make you sad that this ride ends?

23
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.700
Do you think about your mortality?

24
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.380
<v 1>Yeah. Uh.</v>

25
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.113
<v 0>Are you afraid of it?</v>

26
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.410
<v 1>Uh, not exactly afraid of it, but sadden by it. And, uh,</v>

27
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.290
uh, you know,

28
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.930
I'm old enough to know that I've lived most of my life

29
00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.610
and, uh, uh, I enjoy being alive. I,

30
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.320
I can imagine being sick and not wanting to be alive, but I'm not. And so,

31
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.040
uh, I'm.

32
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.480
<v 0>Not, it's been a good ride. Uh.</v>

33
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.400
<v 1>Yeah, I'm not ha and I'm not happy to see it come to,</v>

34
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.320
then I'd like to see it prolong, but, uh, I, I don't,

35
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.320
uh, I, I, I,

36
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.270
I don't fear the dying itself or that kind of thing. It's more,

37
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.910
I'd like to prolong, uh, what is, I think, uh,

38
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.950
uh, a good life that I'm Le living and still living.

39
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.950
<v 0>It's kind of, it's sad to think that the,</v>

40
00:02:41.951 --> 00:02:46.750
the fineness of it is the thing that makes it special

41
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.140
and it, and also sad to, um,

42
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.900
you know, to me, at least it's kind of,

43
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.700
I don't think I'm using too strong of a word,

44
00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.160
but it's kind of terrifying the uncertainty of it,

45
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.520
the mystery of it, you know, the, the mystery of death, the mystery of it. Yeah.

46
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:09.440
Of death. When we're talking about the mystery of black holes,

47
00:03:09.441 --> 00:03:13.200
that's somehow distant. That's somehow out there and the mystery of our own,

48
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.100
but.

49
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.880
<v 1>But, but even life, the mystery of consciousness, I find, uh,</v>

50
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.110
so hard to deal with too. I mean, it's not as painful. I mean, we're conscious,

51
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.110
but the whole magic of life, we can understand,

52
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.350
but consciousness where we can actually think and so forth.

53
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.950
<v 0>It's pretty, it's such,</v>

54
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.750
it seems like such a beautiful gift that it really sucks that, uh,

55
00:03:36.751 --> 00:03:39.460
we get the let go of it. We have to let go of, yeah.

56
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:43.140
What do you hope your legacy is as I'm sure they will, uh,

57
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.540
aliens when they visit and humans have destroyed all of, uh, human civilization,

58
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.660
aliens read about you and encyclopedia, they will leave behind, uh,

59
00:03:51.661 --> 00:03:52.540
what do you hope? It says.

60
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.180
<v 1>Well, I would, I would hope they, if,</v>

61
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.210
to the extent that they evaluated me, uh,

62
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.010
felt that I helped move science forward as a

63
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.530
tangible contribution. And that, uh,

64
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.490
I served as a good role model for how humans should live their lives.

65
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.770
<v 0>And were part of creating one of the most incredible things humans</v>

66
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.920
have ever created. So yes, there's the science, that's the firmly thing, right?

67
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.353
Yeah. Uh, there.

68
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.253
<v 1>And the instrument.</v>

69
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.880
<v 0>I guess, and the instrument, the instrument is a magical creation,</v>

70
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.240
not just by a human, by a collection of humans. The collaboration

71
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.880
is, um, that's,

72
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.430
that's humanity at his best. Uh, I, I do hope,

73
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.630
I do hope we last quite a bit longer, but if we don't,

74
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.670
this is a good, uh, thing to remember humans by at least they built that thing.

75
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.510
&lt;laugh&gt;, that's pretty impressive. Barry, this is an amazing conversation.

76
00:04:59.511 --> 00:05:03.220
Thank you so much for wasting you your time in explaining, uh, so many things.

77
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.500
So, well, I appreciate your time today. Thank.

78
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.660
<v 1>You.</v>
