WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.620
<v 0>But the reason I bring that up is because there's this whole industry of people</v>

2
00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:12.210
that, uh, seem to not really contribute much to the publication process,

3
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.840
but they, they make themselves seem necessary for like,

4
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:19.410
if you want to be in the New York times bestseller list kind of thing,

5
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.430
but also just being like reputable. Yeah.

6
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.430
Which is I'm allergic to the whole concept, but it does.

7
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.440
Do you think it's possible to be on the New York times bestseller list and be a

8
00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:35.040
reputable author and still be, self-published.

9
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.420
<v 1>Not what you would want to do. Like people like Mark Sisson,</v>

10
00:00:38.421 --> 00:00:40.340
I think is his name. He wrote like the primal blueprint.

11
00:00:40.341 --> 00:00:44.360
So like if I'm getting the names, correct. He's the first paleo guy, right?

12
00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:47.990
So he's, he self-published it, it sold gangbusters. Um,

13
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.410
but that would be on their health chart, I believe. And, uh,

14
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.720
it's a little bit of a different situation.

15
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.840
You'd be reaching much more for the mainstream. Um,

16
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.850
you'd be giving up a lot if you go through a publisher, especially financially,

17
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.983
but yeah,

18
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.340
you are not going to have the credit because there publishing is a cartel,

19
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.710
the New York times as part of this cartel,

20
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.820
and if you don't publish within this cartel,

21
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.990
they will do what they can as any cartel has to,

22
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.520
by necessity of being cartel to pretend you don't exist. So they will,

23
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.290
uh, I was, I think the first one to have an hour on book TV for dear reader.

24
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.480
Cause that was a Kickstarter book. Um,

25
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.520
but this is something that people do read. It was a Kickstarter book. Yeah. Um,

26
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.420
this is something people would have to be aware of.

27
00:01:38.421 --> 00:01:40.370
So you would be giving up a lot,

28
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.300
but you'd also be giving a lot to work with a publisher because you're losing

29
00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:48.110
like a year and a half of your life because they're glacial and they don't care.

30
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.390
<v 0>That's my problem. It's not the money. I mean,</v>

31
00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:53.630
the money is whatever percent they take. 10, 20, 30, 50.

32
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.940
<v 1>They're taking a huge chunk. So if I sell a book through St. Martins,</v>

33
00:01:58.941 --> 00:02:03.290
it's a dollar. If I sell a book through Amazon, which is dear reader, that's $6.

34
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.110
So that's what, 87%. It's something crazy.

35
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.930
<v 0>But for me, what bothers me, isn't the money that, that for me personally,</v>

36
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.150
for me will bothers me as in competence.

37
00:02:14.151 --> 00:02:16.280
Like whenever I go to the DMV or something like that.

38
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.800
<v 1>Can I interrupt you? Yeah. Let's talk in confidence.</v>

39
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.310
<v 0>New ride comes out last year. Yes. I get on Rogan, get on Ruben.</v>

40
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.320
<v 1>All of them. And I said, I got in these shows,</v>

41
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.720
is there money in the budget for travel?

42
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.360
<v 0>And they say.</v>

43
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.070
<v 1>We don't have the budget.</v>

44
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.850
<v 0>Fine. By the way you got on those shows with no help from them.</v>

45
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.160
<v 1>Oh yeah. That's not even a question. Uh,</v>

46
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.920
the reason they would want you to do a book is because they know you could get

47
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.470
the only reason people get book deals nowadays,

48
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.620
literally it's because they know that person can market their own book.

49
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.000
That's the only way. And I got a Ruben, I got a Rogan and they,

50
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.220
they go and have the money for the bunch for traveling, which is fair.

51
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.550
They can do Skype. They told me this in writing and I'm like, okay.

52
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.570
And.

53
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.340
<v 0>They can financially cover Skype.</v>

54
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.780
<v 1>No, but it's like, Hey Joe. Yeah, we don't have the budget,</v>

55
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:11.680
but you're going to do Skype.

56
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.760
So there is another friend of mine was

57
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.640
on a show on CNBC when the seem to lab.

58
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.490
And they said in the scene wants a copy of the book. And they're like, Oh yeah.

59
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:31.360
It's like four o'clock on Friday. So we're closed. So,

60
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.310
and he's like, he went there, picked it up and walked into the two blocks.

61
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.200
So there is, it's almost cartoonish. Yeah.

62
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.210
And it's not incompetence it's um, it's past that.

63
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.550
It's something almost,

64
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.850
you can't really believe that I've had two friends who have been literally

65
00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:56.560
rendered suicidal, um, because this was such a huge opportunity for them.

66
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.650
And it was like watching their kid get beaten in front of them.

67
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.210
And I had to talk them off the ledge.

68
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:05.110
So it's people do not appreciate how bad here's another one.

69
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.680
<v 0>The apathy of bureaucracy, something like that.</v>

70
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.420
<v 1>I did this book, concierge confidential. There's a typo in the first chapter.</v>

71
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.160
Dan's with, I'm about to too. They didn't fix it for the paperback

72
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.340
carrot. It's just like, wow. Okay. Yeah. Great book. By the way. Got it.

73
00:04:23.341 --> 00:04:26.130
Got NPR. Gave it one, the books of the year. So that was cool.

74
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.490
<v 0>So why participate in this?</v>

75
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.480
<v 1>Otherwise New York times is going to pretend you don't exist. Uh,</v>

76
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.870
getting booked on some booked on some shows might be more difficult.

77
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.770
Although I think that's collapsing in real time. Um,

78
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.440
you're not going to get reviewed necessarily places like PW, um,

79
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.303
or some others.

80
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.450
<v 0>So the new book you're working on, you don't have a title yet or like pill,</v>

81
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.370
the white pill. Are you self publishing that? Oh yeah,

82
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.620
for sure. And what's the thinking behind that?

83
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.820
Just because you already have a huge following and a big platform and uh.

84
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.500
<v 1>It's six times the cash. If I finished the book in December,</v>

85
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.180
I could have it out in February.

86
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.970
If I finished the book in December with the publisher,

87
00:05:11.971 --> 00:05:15.960
it's going to be out in December at the earliest 20, 21.

88
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.420
Why am I giving up 10 months of my life?

89
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.720
<v 0>Well, this is a big one. Do you have any leverage? Like do,</v>

90
00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:25.740
do authors have leveraged to say F you like, can you just say,

91
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.780
what do you mean? Just look meaning like, uh,

92
00:05:29.781 --> 00:05:32.100
I want to release this book into me.

93
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.910
<v 1>Oh no, no. I mean, you'll have a contract and then your agent can fight it,</v>

94
00:05:35.911 --> 00:05:36.750
but they don't have the Bureau.

95
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.210
They don't have the capacity to rush things through.

96
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.720
<v 0>Yeah. I guess if the I've heard like big authors, I don't know, Sam Harris,</v>

97
00:05:45.721 --> 00:05:50.640
all those folks talk about like, they've accepted it actually they've accepted.

98
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.440
They're like, yeah. It takes a long time to, I'm.

99
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.570
<v 1>Not accepting it, but.</v>

100
00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.050
<v 0>Yeah, but you're kind of implying that a human being like me should, like,</v>

101
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.850
I'm saying these are your options, right? So I just, I just hate it.

102
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.480
I hate the waiting because it's in competence. It's not the,

103
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.460
it's not necessarily the weight. If I knew it wasn't, you know,

104
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.420
if it was the kind of people that are all up at 2:00 AM at night,

105
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.250
on a Friday and they love what you're doing and they're helping create something

106
00:06:22.251 --> 00:06:26.630
special. That's the sense I get with some of the Netflix folks, for example, uh,

107
00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.660
that work with people. I just, I don't know anything about this world,

108
00:06:29.661 --> 00:06:34.310
but you get like Netflix folks who, who help with shows.

109
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.700
You could tell that they're obsessed with those shows. Like, yeah,

110
00:06:37.701 --> 00:06:41.150
you're not gonna get that publishing if you hand, like I handed the book in,

111
00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:45.530
I think it was July. I didn't hear anything from my editor until December.
