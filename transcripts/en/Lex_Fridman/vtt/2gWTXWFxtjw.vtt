00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.290
<v 0>As opposed to just fighting.</v>

2
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:08.010
This is the really interesting thing about brave is as opposed to just fighting

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.940
in and being treated like an ad blocker, you're providing an alternate.

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.193
There's a,

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.760
there's a philosophical idea here that might change the nature of the internet

6
00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:19.770
with a basic attention token. Yes.

7
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.050
Maybe what is basic attention, token bat and how does it.

8
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.490
<v 1>Okay. I'll tell the story first by saying how I came to it.</v>

9
00:00:28.491 --> 00:00:31.100
I realized for a long time at Firefox,

10
00:00:31.101 --> 00:00:34.700
we were dependent on the school search deal. And I thought, you know,

11
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.160
w now the Chrome's out. Maybe that's going to go away. And they'd just,

12
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.310
at some point, Google will say, you know, Firefox, you know, like old yeller,

13
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.460
you saved me from the rabid beast. Now you have to shoot you in the head. Yeah.

14
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.490
Done your job. Sad, but true goodbye.

15
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.410
And what can we do? And I think this, most of all, it doesn't know what to do.

16
00:00:54.411 --> 00:00:57.050
This is something that I couldn't solve there and I don't think they can solve,

17
00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.700
but I thought,

18
00:00:58.701 --> 00:01:02.600
why is the browser that sort of passive servant of these big tech companies?

19
00:01:02.601 --> 00:01:07.550
Why is it a blind runtime for ad tech JavaScripts, including from Google?

20
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.640
Why doesn't it block some? And if it blocks them,

21
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.240
why can't it reconnect users,

22
00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:18.560
readers fans with publishers, creators websites, uh,

23
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.750
why can't it help people make direct payments or even possibly get an ad

24
00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:26.210
revenue share for private ads that are placed in the browser?

25
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.860
The ads are all placed in the browser.

26
00:01:27.861 --> 00:01:30.950
Some people will have this sort of model that the server's painting the ad into

27
00:01:30.951 --> 00:01:33.290
some flash, uh,

28
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.940
combined package or into some giant image. And then it all gets sent down.

29
00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:38.774
That's not how it works.

30
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.620
All the ads you see on the web are placed in your browser by calling out to

31
00:01:42.621 --> 00:01:45.890
various ad tech partners and Googles among them.

32
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.190
And so if you block those scripts, you, you break the,

33
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.200
the advertising flow of money from the brands and their

34
00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:56.060
agencies to the publishers.

35
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.750
And if you want to reconnect it directly with the user,

36
00:01:59.751 --> 00:02:01.460
you have limited choices. The user generally,

37
00:02:01.461 --> 00:02:04.790
isn't going to sign up with an ACH bank connection or a credit card.

38
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.660
The publisher isn't going to sign up the user acceptance as a subscriber,

39
00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:11.270
and then they're going to overcharge you because they want you to cross

40
00:02:11.271 --> 00:02:13.910
subsidize all the content and buy more than you read and all that stuff.

41
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.700
And how many people are doing great,

42
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.860
who are big names like New York times and the Washington post.

43
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.710
But how many subscriptions are you as a user going to pay for?

44
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.910
This is why startups like Tony Hale scroll are trying to do a portable

45
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.110
subscription system.

46
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.150
<v 0>By the way, just on a small tangent there, even the New York times,</v>

47
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.230
it's really annoying how difficult it is to subscribe.

48
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.850
There's way too many clicks.

49
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.410
<v 1>They don't make it easy. And I had friends a few years ago.</v>

50
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:39.680
I think they fixed this who would pay for the paper and then they'd go online

51
00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:43.460
and they get charged for the digital. And they, there was no break.

52
00:02:43.461 --> 00:02:47.570
There was no connection between them, but publishers are not that technical.

53
00:02:47.571 --> 00:02:49.940
And there, they can't all get you to subscribe.

54
00:02:49.941 --> 00:02:52.370
You can't have a thousand subscriptions. So for a long time,

55
00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:53.780
people talked about micro payments.

56
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.290
That was Blendle and another ones which came to the U S but didn't grow.

57
00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.580
And I thought,

58
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.230
if you have just a browser and it's protecting you by blocking all this ad tech

59
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.100
tracking junk,

60
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.170
it can provide you an option that uses cryptocurrency to let you support your,

61
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.840
your, your favorite sites and even YouTube channels.

62
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.550
And that we prototyped with Bitcoin.

63
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.840
And that meant the user had to be of means to contribute and willing to

64
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:19.540
contribute, but it could be done on the Bitcoin blockchain.

65
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:20.860
And it could be fairly efficient,

66
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.800
even though Bitcoin went through a period when we had this prototype running in

67
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:26.110
2016, into 2017,

68
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:29.110
where Bitcoin was very congested and very slow to confirm,

69
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:31.090
and the fees got very high. Um,

70
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.420
and a lot of users who were not Bitcoin maximalist or even experienced, we,

71
00:03:35.421 --> 00:03:37.840
we helped them out by embedding a Coinbase buy widget,

72
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.840
and they had the income to buy, but it was hard. It was like,

73
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.320
I'll do I buy a $5 a month? But the fee is like four 50.

74
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.170
I better buy in larger batches. Right? Then they're like,

75
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.830
I don't want to own that much Bitcoin. So it became this, this painful thing.

76
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.810
And the real idea that I had of private ads to pay the user of rev share,

77
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.980
couldn't be realized alone in that kind of system,

78
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.600
in these cryptocurrency systems, especially with the blockchain,

79
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:06.940
we switched to a theorem, you can have smart contracts.

80
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.310
The Bitcoin system is not turning complete.

81
00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:10.960
So what you can do with the script is more limited,

82
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.850
but you can still do sort of clever things. Um, even with Bitcoin script,

83
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.800
what we wanted to do was sort of a three sided ecosystem. We wanted users,

84
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.620
creators, or publishers and advertisers,

85
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.160
and we wanted the advertisers to put money in just like they do today,

86
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.390
but without going through the Googles and the app nexuses and all these other ad

87
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:34.360
tech companies, because those companies take out a huge cut.

88
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.270
The guardian in the UK once did an experiment for months.

89
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.710
They bought out their own ad space.

90
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.260
They put in the pound and they were paid 30 pens,

91
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.240
70% was coming out to the intermediary vendors they were using.

92
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.600
Um, um, and that's like the opposite of what the app store does.

93
00:04:49.601 --> 00:04:52.600
The app store takes 30% and gives the publisher 70%.

94
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.220
So pretty broken in the old days of the Superstation TBS, the media,

95
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.190
um, owner would get 85%.

96
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.690
So these splits have become really unbalanced in the middle players.

97
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.230
The ad tech vendors are taking out way too much money, and they're,

98
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.740
they're doing something worse, which has been noticed there. They're letting,

99
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.880
um, not just the malware vendors, but also the ad fraud side,

100
00:05:15.881 --> 00:05:19.990
which fakes the publishers and clickbait merchants,

101
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.260
uh, come in and steal traffic from good sites.

102
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.560
Because once you have a certain audience identified at one site,

103
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.690
Jason Calacanis told me this about his experience with,

104
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.930
I guess it was in gadget, uh, what site he was running.

105
00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:33.520
But once he started using, uh,

106
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.510
an ad partner that was sharing his audience information across multiple sites,

107
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.820
he saw his competitors stealing all his traffic.

108
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.200
And then what's worse is the clickbait sites that just have much cheaper rates,

109
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.490
steal all of that traffic. And that facilitates, you know, fraud facilitates,

110
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.650
um, fake news, all sorts of problems. So Frey blocks it.

111
00:05:53.651 --> 00:05:58.130
And then we give users the ability to give back and because invested the basic

112
00:05:58.131 --> 00:06:00.860
attention token and Ethereum, we can do this, three-way split,

113
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.240
and we can give users a share of the revenue. And if they want to take it out,

114
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:08.570
they can now unfortunately for us, and for all of blockchain,

115
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:12.020
the regulators are saying, we're going to have to know who you are. There's,

116
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.910
there's the treasury department's, uh, FinCEN, uh,

117
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.710
agency. There's the office of foreign asset controls, OFAC. Um, there's the,

118
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.020
um, you know,

119
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.500
other regulators in the federal government that take a very dark look at things

120
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:31.550
like money laundering and sending money to someone named Osama bin Ladin.

121
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:35.840
So compliance starts to come in and even now they're threatening for pure

122
00:06:35.841 --> 00:06:39.410
Bitcoin sending to some address. If you're a Coinbase,

123
00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:42.440
you're going to have to know who's at that address. You're gonna the actual.

124
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.420
<v 0>Identities of people involved now.</v>

125
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.220
<v 1>With Coinbase members, you sign up and they know you,</v>

126
00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:49.610
and they comply with regulations. There are regulated money services, business,

127
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.440
uh, and, um,

128
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.430
but if somebody is using their own self custody,

129
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.420
so-called self custodial wallet where they have the hardware private key,

130
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.630
and they're not named. And they want to send to that address.

131
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:06.890
Our friends in the fed government are talking about requiring at some threshold,

132
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:08.330
knowing who that is. So yeah.

133
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.820
<v 0>Some thresholds that's unreasonable. It's not that big. Um, yeah.</v>

134
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.090
I don't know how this will play out. I think crypto is here to stay.

135
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.640
<v 1>I think the beauty of being able to send peer to peer without any bank in the</v>

136
00:07:18.641 --> 00:07:19.930
middle of that, and, you know,

137
00:07:19.931 --> 00:07:23.320
huge wire charge and two day delay and all that nonsense, it's beautiful.

138
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.740
I've used it and I love it, but we're pregnancies to brave about crypto.

139
00:07:26.741 --> 00:07:29.410
And we realized that anything like a revenue split,

140
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.530
we can't facilitate without being licensed in a certain way.

141
00:07:32.531 --> 00:07:34.030
And it requires knowing who the user is.

142
00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.460
So our default mode doesn't know who the user is.

143
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.400
It instead imputes to the user's browser,

144
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:44.830
some of the revenue and allows that browser to steer it back to the

145
00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.720
creators. And we do have to identify the creators,

146
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:50.410
but as things improve and you know, who knows how it'll play out,

147
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:54.640
there should come a day when this, this full vision could be done more, uh,

148
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.050
fully on a blockchain,

149
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.620
but regulations and the practicalities of today's blockchains,

150
00:07:59.621 --> 00:08:03.040
which are not that fast, um, and not anonymous over time.

151
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.580
You fingerprint yourself over time. Uh, we do some of this with the browser.

152
00:08:06.581 --> 00:08:11.500
So one of the ideas of the basic attention token is to make a

153
00:08:11.501 --> 00:08:13.720
hybrid system that's stronger than blockchain alone.

154
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:18.250
It's the browser and the blockchain and the browser is this trusted end point

155
00:08:18.251 --> 00:08:21.400
software. It's this universal app. Everyone uses browsers,

156
00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:24.430
the bigger the screen, the more you're in the browser. And unless you install,

157
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:29.260
you know, fat clients for things, um, I use Slack on, on Mac iOS and it's,

158
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.440
it's like a browser it's based on, uh, electron framework we used to use.

159
00:08:32.441 --> 00:08:34.810
And it's just, it's not that great. I, I,

160
00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.630
some people at brave use Slack in brave as a.

161
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.350
<v 0>In the browser. Yeah. Browser. Yeah. I use that often. Yeah. And I noticed that.</v>

162
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.430
<v 1>The iPad, I use apps less, um, the smaller, the screen, you know,</v>

163
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:50.140
the browser got handicapped by Apple and Android, both. And it also, uh,

164
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:53.020
you know, it can be slower or not have the right affordances,

165
00:08:53.021 --> 00:08:56.520
your interface with, uh, the security, uh, limited API APIs,

166
00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.920
but in principle with the right permission,

167
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.890
and you can make the web browser just as good as any app,

168
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.220
you make it be a super app. And that's part of our mission at brave.

169
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.320
So we want to have the economics.

170
00:09:07.321 --> 00:09:11.040
I got captured by these big tech companies through tracking and through social

171
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:13.650
networks. We want to block that for your own safety,

172
00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:17.760
and then let you opt into a cleaner world where you keep your data defended in

173
00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:19.920
your browser, and you can actually realize value from it.

174
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.590
So the way our ad system works, I mentioned that being private,

175
00:09:22.591 --> 00:09:25.140
but how does that work? We don't see your data at all.

176
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.920
All browsers are sort of the mother of all data feeds your history,

177
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.960
all your searches, that all engines,

178
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.810
each engine sees the queries you send to it, but it doesn't see the others,

179
00:09:33.811 --> 00:09:37.530
but the browser sees them all machine learning in the browser that you can opt

180
00:09:37.531 --> 00:09:42.090
into, can study all that in a very complete way and do a better job than Google.

181
00:09:42.091 --> 00:09:43.380
This Google has, you know,

182
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:48.180
cookie and scripts across the web from occurring DoubleClick. They have YouTube,

183
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:51.390
they have Android, they have search, which is still their big revenue line,

184
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.090
but they don't see everything. The browser sees everything.

185
00:09:54.091 --> 00:09:57.000
And if it can do a good job locally, and this is not advanced machine learning,

186
00:09:57.001 --> 00:10:01.530
this is not TensorFlow. This is like, SVMs now native bays. Um,

187
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.340
then you can match intense signals.

188
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.810
Intent signals from those data feeds, searches the queries, the history,

189
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.380
how much you're scrolling down the page, uh, how much you read it, a search,

190
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.080
it's all blind browser algorithm.

191
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.970
We don't see that data and then pick the best ad from a fixed catalog per day.

192
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.760
And the catalog is fixed across a large population per day.

193
00:10:23.761 --> 00:10:27.060
And it only updates once a day because new offers come in and the old ones,

194
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:31.710
his wire, sometimes every week or every month and that catalog,

195
00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:35.820
and there can be many such catalogs is sold by our direct sales team.

196
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.031
And so we're,

197
00:10:37.031 --> 00:10:40.980
we're making an anonymous audience available to advertisers without the

198
00:10:40.981 --> 00:10:43.790
advertisers tracking them. Instead, each browser is,

199
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:47.520
there's a little machine learning system. That's picking the best catalog entry.

200
00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:50.730
Now the catalog is not the ads. Those are big, right? It's a video or a webpage.

201
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:54.120
It's just the link to an edge cache. And there are many such edge caches.

202
00:10:54.121 --> 00:10:56.860
We're not trying to protect them from seeing your IP address.

203
00:10:56.861 --> 00:11:00.390
It's not really feasible. We could use Tor, but we don't yet. Um,

204
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.920
and some keywords about the app. So it's basically like metadata and a link.

205
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.630
And that's what the catalog consists of.

206
00:11:06.631 --> 00:11:07.860
And that's what the machine learning picks, right?

207
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:12.110
<v 0>The machine learning is learning about you specifically locally. Yes.</v>

208
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.150
In order to choose from the catalog of different ads,

209
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.930
it couldn't possibly be like a multi-billion dollar.

210
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:23.030
Isn't this taken on the Google ad ad. So like what, I mean,

211
00:11:23.031 --> 00:11:28.000
one question to ask that there seems to be some really profound ideas here that

212
00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:31.700
are different than what the internet has grown up to be.

213
00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:35.600
If brave or something like brave.

214
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.880
The idea is a fundamental philosophical ideas.

215
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:42.590
Underlying brave went out and runs 95% of the internet.

216
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:47.800
How does that change? Uh, the what,

217
00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.020
what are the major things he changes about the internet? So social networks,

218
00:11:51.021 --> 00:11:54.130
and then the creatives, like YouTube creators, all that kind of stuff. So.

219
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.620
<v 1>Let's talk about that. First of all, what brave gets 95%.</v>

220
00:11:56.621 --> 00:12:00.940
I'm going to demand a recount because I won't believe it. I don't know. I think,

221
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:01.450
uh,

222
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.960
we're trying to put things into web standards that can be standardized across

223
00:12:04.961 --> 00:12:05.321
browsers.

224
00:12:05.321 --> 00:12:10.300
So the main value of brave will be the trust users have in us and our ability to

225
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:15.100
give the best deal to users. So 70% of the gross ad revenue we give to the user.

226
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:19.000
And if they go through that KYC process, as I mentioned, they can take it out.

227
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.970
They can also give it back. Like it takes them out,

228
00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.730
give the rest back and they can add basic attention tokens to give back.

229
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.460
Some of them turn off the ads because it just don't like ads,

230
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:31.360
but they put in $20 a month. I believe [inaudible] does that.

231
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:34.900
And that's very generous because the browser is just anonymously based on his

232
00:12:34.901 --> 00:12:38.470
browsing sort of keeping score on how much time he spent on this video,

233
00:12:38.471 --> 00:12:43.060
on that website. And if those sites verify in sort of a,

234
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.390
like getting a domain certificate fashion, they can get paid,

235
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:51.430
they can get a part of his $20 a month. So that vision could go big.

236
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.680
And if it does, I hope it's across mobile browsers.

237
00:12:53.681 --> 00:12:57.850
I don't know that they'll all compete well on the quality of the ads,

238
00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.910
the quality of the ad blocking and tracking protection. Those,

239
00:13:00.911 --> 00:13:03.370
those are subject to competition. It'll take a while to standardize them,

240
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.780
but I think that would be a better world. It would have less counterparty risk,

241
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.000
fewer fee takers in the middle, really just the browser. We're taking 30%, um,

242
00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.690
sort of the app tours, app store split. And if we get bigger,

243
00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:20.830
maybe we can take even less social networks creators. If you look at YouTube,

244
00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:25.150
as a lot of them are the Indies that are getting some size are getting

245
00:13:25.151 --> 00:13:28.720
sponsorship deals. Uh, they're, they're using Patrion.

246
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.950
They're encouraging people to subscribe and give them regular money through

247
00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:37.990
Patrion, but that's centralized your Patrion. So there's censorship hazards.

248
00:13:37.991 --> 00:13:41.290
There's a 5% fee. What if that were web standard?

249
00:13:41.291 --> 00:13:42.730
What if brave pioneer at first?

250
00:13:42.731 --> 00:13:47.350
And we took 3% and we did it in a way that was three-year

251
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.470
browsers. So we couldn't sensor it as brilliant. Yeah.

252
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:55.860
<v 0>It could be standardized across browsers can like explore a come in again. And,</v>

253
00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:56.340
uh.

254
00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.820
<v 1>I think protocols are easy to copy and that they're meant to be interpretable.</v>

255
00:13:59.821 --> 00:14:00.690
So it's,

256
00:14:00.691 --> 00:14:04.320
there's a risk there and the loyal users might be tricked into leaving you,

257
00:14:04.321 --> 00:14:06.300
or they might, because of that distribution power,

258
00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.960
you might end up getting stomped. Um, I don't know. I can't predict the future.

259
00:14:09.961 --> 00:14:12.840
I think anti-trust is back on the case finally, in the U S and,

260
00:14:12.841 --> 00:14:15.450
and certainly in Europe, DG comp is doing its thing.

261
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:19.020
So I'm hopeful that we'll have a period of innovation. Uh, you know,

262
00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.810
people were talking like Elizabeth Warren was talking about breaking up the tech

263
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:23.850
tech companies very clearly. Um,

264
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.790
now she didn't win and I suspect that won't happen,

265
00:14:26.791 --> 00:14:30.660
but I also suspect that Google might be smart enough to see they should do

266
00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:33.690
something more than just put privacy perfume on Chrome.

267
00:14:33.691 --> 00:14:36.360
They should maybe get rid of click or something, divest something.

268
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.040
I don't know it might happen.

269
00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:38.521
<v 0>So,</v>

270
00:14:38.521 --> 00:14:41.580
so brave might inspire Google to completely change the way they're doing things,

271
00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:41.940
right.

272
00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.780
<v 1>We're already doing something you may have read about called the privacy sandbox</v>

273
00:14:45.781 --> 00:14:49.980
or, um, flock, which they have this bird metaphor going. Um,

274
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:53.990
turtledove, um, fledge. But these, these,

275
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.590
these systems have been very, Google-y kind of over-engineer. And yet,

276
00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.740
depending on differential privacy, which has weakness over time,

277
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.980
if you know how that works, it's kind of injecting noise to hide you in a,

278
00:15:03.981 --> 00:15:07.130
in a crowd. But over time, an adversary can pull you out of the crowd.

279
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:12.290
This doesn't look like it's gonna become a standard like Apple, brave Mozilla.

280
00:15:12.291 --> 00:15:14.540
We're not going to just say, Oh, Google, you saved us.

281
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.390
You've indebted the privacy sandbox. And we'll all just adopt it.

282
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:18.793
Not going to be that easy.

283
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.860
It's going to be more like pieces of what we do in brave,

284
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:26.240
this anonymous ad matching or the blind signature cryptography we use to confirm

285
00:15:26.241 --> 00:15:28.520
the ad impressions. That's David chums.

286
00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.650
You mentioned that could get standardized.

287
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.390
If that's some of that is being standardized.

288
00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.930
Even Google is in favor of so-called trust tokens. What's your champion blind,

289
00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:37.250
blind signature certs,

290
00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.340
but they're not using them for ad confirmations because they don't want to blow

291
00:15:40.341 --> 00:15:43.820
up their own business. Um, and they need to let some of the publishers,

292
00:15:43.821 --> 00:15:47.480
they serve have other ad tech scripts on the page.

293
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:50.150
And so they're kind of caught, and this is something I realized doing great.

294
00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:54.140
I thought what's, Google's innovator's dilemma apart from just, you know,

295
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:58.700
being mature and having trouble innovating it's that they have come to depend on

296
00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:01.880
this ad tech system that has all these,

297
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:06.380
these vendors that are publishers rely on because publishers aren't technical

298
00:16:06.381 --> 00:16:08.270
enough. And I feel for the publishers,

299
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.220
but I realized the users have to come first.

300
00:16:10.221 --> 00:16:13.190
And if you give the users a better browser, that's faster,

301
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:17.450
then you'll get enough users to give back or support publishers,

302
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:21.470
the speed and the battery savings. And the data plan savings are significant.

303
00:16:21.471 --> 00:16:23.630
There's so much bad JavaScript involved in ad tech.

304
00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.020
If you block it and you sort of chop off the what's called the programmatic

305
00:16:27.021 --> 00:16:29.330
waterfall, which chains a bunch of requests.

306
00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:31.450
<v 0>Yeah. That's one of the incredible things about brave,</v>

307
00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.610
I guess you're saying you should attribute it to the fact that the, the,

308
00:16:34.611 --> 00:16:38.500
the message, our script, no offense. No, not my Suzy,

309
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:44.770
uh, is, uh, I mean, brave just feels faster. Even then,

310
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.130
I mean, Chrome was fast. And one of the things that it was like,

311
00:16:48.131 --> 00:16:49.700
impressive is it, it,

312
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:53.620
it showed that browsers could be really fast and brave is even faster than that,

313
00:16:53.621 --> 00:16:54.180
which is why.

314
00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.010
<v 1>So much. And it saves the network, which means data,</v>

315
00:16:57.011 --> 00:17:00.070
planet saves battery because of the radio consumes your battery when it's

316
00:17:00.071 --> 00:17:03.250
running more to do those requests. And it's just stunning how many there are,

317
00:17:03.251 --> 00:17:06.190
like some of my Google friends were like, Oh, that's just that bad site.

318
00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:09.280
They'll fix it. And you actually do a survey of webpages. That's like,

319
00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:10.270
mostly like that.

320
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.420
I know Google or Google engineers could make everything super efficient,

321
00:17:13.421 --> 00:17:16.060
but they can't, especially in antitrust court do it.

322
00:17:16.061 --> 00:17:18.730
They cannot take over all the publishers and do that.

323
00:17:18.731 --> 00:17:22.930
They're trying with accelerated mobile profile amp. They're trying to pull,

324
00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:24.910
the publishers are like, Oh, you poor publishers.

325
00:17:24.911 --> 00:17:28.440
Don't know how to make your pages fast. Put them on our amp system.

326
00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:30.640
We'll give you extra placement in the search carousel.

327
00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.850
That's an antitrust problem for one, but it's also publishers.

328
00:17:33.851 --> 00:17:36.070
We talked to hate it because it degrades their brand.

329
00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.290
Now they look like a gig writer wrote a piece.

330
00:17:38.291 --> 00:17:42.190
That's got Google's framing and amp URL on top of it.

331
00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:43.630
And they're trying to fix that too,

332
00:17:43.631 --> 00:17:47.560
but it just looks like a Google's board defying all these publishers and they

333
00:17:47.561 --> 00:17:49.320
don't want to be plugged into the Borg cube.

334
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:53.010
They want to build up their own brand and have loyal readers. So, you know,

335
00:17:53.011 --> 00:17:56.850
I'm in favor of giving the users power to help all the

336
00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.700
publishers in the little platoons and the creators.
