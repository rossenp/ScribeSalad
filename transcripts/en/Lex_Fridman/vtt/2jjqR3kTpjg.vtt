00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.600
<v 0>What do you mean your people? What do you mean? Your people?</v>

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.720
You mean your Russians? Did you hear what she said about Russians? Did you.

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.680
<v 1>Hear what she says? Russians, I love Russians. You know what I didn't love.</v>

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.600
Yeah. The Russian recruiting video that came out, that was terrifying.

5
00:00:16.601 --> 00:00:18.920
Did you watch him? No. I told you about it and of course you didn't watch it.

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.870
I didn't watch it. Oh, shocker. Um, the USA put out a, a recruiting video.

7
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.950
Yes. And then like a day or two later, Russia put one out.

8
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.470
<v 2>And the recruiting fruit video in the states was a animation of a,</v>

9
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.910
a female soldier. Yeah. With two moms. And she was gonna go change the world.

10
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.420
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; right. Russia came out with &lt;laugh&gt;. It's like,

11
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.140
it's the, the character from like Rocky essentially.

12
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.620
And there are guys in the mud and just in the range, just doing pushups,

13
00:00:51.621 --> 00:00:54.060
just pushing it out. They're just like, they see their boot.

14
00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:56.980
They're just like crushing things. And I'm like, and it's all like,

15
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.620
and deep rush in the voice. I'm like, oh my God.

16
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.860
<v 0>Yeah. Which one is better? Would you say, which bothered you more?</v>

17
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.730
<v 1>What do you mean by bother specify?</v>

18
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.650
<v 0>So deception is a funny thing cuz when you're young and you're choosing to go to</v>

19
00:01:11.651 --> 00:01:13.770
the military or not, it's not like, you know,

20
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.690
like none of us know what the best trajectory for our life is. Right.

21
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.970
For many people go to the military is a really makes them incredible human

22
00:01:21.971 --> 00:01:25.600
beings. Some of the best people in this world, I know our soldier. So it's,

23
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.240
I'm not, I don't mean like it's somehow bad to go to the military.

24
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.920
I think it's a great choice. But there is something

25
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.400
the honest truth is I just don't like marketing people &lt;laugh&gt; well,

26
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.960
and so this is essentially a marketing effort. Yeah. It.

27
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.880
<v 1>Is a marketing effort. And.</v>

28
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.880
<v 0>So which one do you like as a marketing effort? Better &lt;laugh&gt; Russia.</v>

29
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.470
<v 1>Well, oof. Yeah, I do it there. Go. There you go. I do.</v>

30
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.190
Cuz Canada doesn't you know what our recruiting videos are. It's like, um, uh,

31
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.270
I love it. They're the best. Sorry a yeah. Oh. Here we go. It's starting.

32
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.830
It's started. Awesome. So Canada does these ones where it's like, um,

33
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.140
it'll have a bunch of like soldiers doing movements and they'll like,

34
00:02:06.141 --> 00:02:07.180
snip it together really quick.

35
00:02:07.181 --> 00:02:10.340
It'll be like a Navy one and a guy jumping of a plane.

36
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.900
And then it'll be like an artillery. And then like an armored.

37
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.660
Then it'll be like join the Canadian forces today. And like that's like their,

38
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.660
their video. So it's like very marketable,

39
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.580
very palatable to Canadians who don't really want war and who don't really

40
00:02:25.581 --> 00:02:26.130
acknowledge the,

41
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.210
their military in the first place and do everything they can to make sure that

42
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.610
vets don't get any support when they come home. So they,

43
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.930
I can see why that one is, uh, acceptable.

44
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.450
What Russia did was meant to be more of an intimidation tactic. In my opinion.

45
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.350
I like that style better though. I think we need harder. I need,

46
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.590
I think we need people to be,

47
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.020
I think it's acceptable and okay to say that our soldiers need to have a harder

48
00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:53.300
mindset, a stronger mindset,

49
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.900
a better mentality and mental health support going into the service and a harder

50
00:02:57.901 --> 00:03:01.720
body. Because I know when you go to the us,

51
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.760
I've also encountered plenty of soldiers that are 600 pounds.

52
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.720
What are you gonna do?
