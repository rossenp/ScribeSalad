00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.580
<v 0>Uh, uh, with a single boom roasted line. So, uh, any ideas,</v>

2
00:00:07.581 --> 00:00:10.580
maybe you wanna mention malice, but any ideas come to, uh,

3
00:00:10.581 --> 00:00:11.580
mind when you look at me.

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.420
<v 1>Man, I, you know what, uh, if I was gonna boom, roast someone,</v>

5
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.820
I would wanna kind of like research their career and dissect them and figure out

6
00:00:19.821 --> 00:00:22.020
their biggest negatives, get to the core. And I did,

7
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.290
I didn't have that note with you. I figured I, you know,

8
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.130
I got a general sense of, okay. He's really successfully super sharp. Uh,

9
00:00:28.131 --> 00:00:29.930
he's really interested in some really interesting things.

10
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.650
I bet we'll have a great conversation, but I had no intention to roast.

11
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.970
<v 0>You. Yeah. There you go. What about malice? You had dinner with him last night.</v>

12
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.290
<v 1>Hmm? For him &lt;laugh&gt; oh man.</v>

13
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.200
<v 0>Um, how'd you get to know him by the way, Twitter.</v>

14
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.320
<v 1>Just Twitter. What's the most magical place in the world. Right? I,</v>

15
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.280
I always tell people it's the greatest source of information if you know how to

16
00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:51.480
use it. Um Hmm.

17
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.480
<v 0>He's insane on Twitter.</v>

18
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.400
<v 1>Actually. He's quite well. So I had to unfollow him on Twitter cause he,</v>

19
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.120
it was too intense. It's too, just too much. No, it's too much. It fills up.

20
00:00:59.121 --> 00:01:01.920
Like I wanna be able to consume the content. So if I wanna see something,

21
00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:05.870
he says, I can go to his page. Right. But it's just too much for my timeline.

22
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.230
I want to be able to consume who I follow.

23
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.710
So I try to not follow a lot of people cause I wanna be able to consume them.

24
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.870
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um, and he was he? Yeah, he was too much. He, yeah,

25
00:01:13.871 --> 00:01:15.510
he fights the trolls, which, uh,

26
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.750
I don't know why we would ever fight the trolls. There's just too many of them.

27
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.710
Well, he's the troll.

28
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.190
<v 0>Himself. He's like the big troll fighting the little trolls.</v>

29
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.470
&lt;laugh&gt; he's the king troll. He.

30
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.540
<v 1>Here's a million of em. So even if you kill, if you kill a hundred thousand,</v>

31
00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:29.380
they're still not a hundred thousand left. Yeah. They just keep.

32
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.220
<v 0>Calling call you just gotta ignore 'em it's the like the night Walker or</v>

33
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.940
whatever. Yeah. Well I'll take it cuz you had nothing. Um, you,

34
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.860
you couldn't rose GSP outta respect too. So I'm just gonna take that as a.

35
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.300
<v 1>Sign of respect. Why do you say bad about GSP? I, now I try roast his hair.</v>

36
00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:47.290
Like why'd you try to grow, grow hair now after all these years. Yeah.

37
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.250
He looked good. Bald. Everyone loved him with his head shave. Yeah.

38
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.370
Now it looks kind of strange. It's like why you got hair now?

39
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.211
<v 0>Well, it was, uh,</v>

40
00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:58.010
one of the more surreal moments of my life is so he was here and he wore a black

41
00:01:58.011 --> 00:02:01.570
suit and tie. Uh oh really? Yeah. We did the podcast with him,

42
00:02:01.571 --> 00:02:06.080
just mirror image of me. And then we also did, uh, I have an really, yeah,

43
00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:09.280
but just the video together and us doing martial arts stuff in,

44
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.600
in the suit and tie. That was quite, that's funny. That was quite, uh,

45
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.560
that that's like, like certain moments in your life are just like,

46
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.280
I can't believe I was part of that. Yeah.

47
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.520
<v 1>From, uh, with GSP. Uh, so yeah, I don't,</v>

48
00:02:22.521 --> 00:02:24.520
I don't think have anything to roast to move out. Um,

49
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.590
I mean maybe be the Matt Sarah thing would be the one that you get him with,

50
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.470
you know? But uh, yeah, I would be,

51
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.110
I would be really fascinated to like really dig deep, uh,

52
00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:36.750
from a sports psychology standpoint because he always talks about how much fear

53
00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:38.670
he had when he was competing. Yeah. And I,

54
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.590
and I find that to be interesting because obviously, so it's almost like to me,

55
00:02:42.591 --> 00:02:47.340
it's almost like was he successful despite that? Not because of that.

56
00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:48.174
Right.

57
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.380
And because anxiety usually is it really negative performance for the majority

58
00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:57.100
of people and what was it about him that the anxiety wasn't super negative?

59
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.600
You know what I'm saying? Like, yeah. It's, it's very interesting.

60
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.120
<v 0>I wonder that too. So I have, I wondered that about him, but I,</v>

61
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.440
I have a huge amount of anxiety interacting,

62
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:07.800
especially with people just about everything. Yeah.

63
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.200
I wonder if that's helpful or, or not. It feels like it's very helpful.

64
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.360
<v 1>Well, I, I think so. I, so okay. I think in two D so I think, uh,</v>

65
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.110
probably your everyday life okay. Is different than like inner performance or,

66
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.310
uh, a competition.

67
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.750
It's you have to be like super in the moment mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; of what you're

68
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:29.430
doing. So anything that's pulling you away, like, oh my gosh, you know,

69
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.070
high school kids, right. That coach mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; oh my gosh, my,

70
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.630
that girls in the stands. And if I get beat then, and they're act,

71
00:03:35.631 --> 00:03:37.790
they're actively thinking about this other thing.

72
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.020
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; when this is on and I need all a hundred percent of your

73
00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:41.940
focus right here. Well.

74
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.100
<v 0>He's never, I don't think he has anxiety in the ring. That's the point?</v>

75
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.620
I think like I have the same thing.

76
00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:50.700
Like if I have a really high performance thing,

77
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.780
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that I have to do, uh,

78
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.340
I don't know a lecture in front of a lot of people. Yeah. That would.

79
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.173
<v 1>Be a great example.</v>

80
00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.210
<v 0>That there's huge amount of anxiety. Weeks ahead, days ahead, hours ahead. So.</v>

81
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.810
<v 1>How, so you have a system to get rid of it then.</v>

82
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.370
<v 0>As you perform? No, I maybe, but it's just, the body gets rid of it somehow.</v>

83
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.570
Yeah. There's not a system subconscious.

84
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.730
<v 1>System. Yeah.</v>

85
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:11.570
<v 0>It's so you don't.</v>

86
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.610
<v 1>Preservation. You don't actually have anxiety while you are performing.</v>

87
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.170
So that's like, so then, then, then that problem,

88
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.970
somehow that problem has solved itself. Right? The problem is when they,

89
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.400
anxiety is actually happening while the wrestling matches happening,

90
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.720
that's the real issue.

91
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.680
<v 0>Yeah. But it it's, it like sneaks in there too.</v>

92
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.840
Is that's the difference between MMA and wrestling is there's no breaks

93
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.320
in wrestling, right? Yes. I guess there is,

94
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.480
you can look at the crowd a little bit. Like you can look so maybe bound maybe,

95
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.230
but like the, uh, there's other things we have to perform. Well,

96
00:04:44.231 --> 00:04:45.710
there's more breaks like a lecture.

97
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.830
You can catch yourself thinking like in this conversation, you know? Yeah.

98
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.230
Like I'll, I've said a bunch of stuff where I think,

99
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.430
why the hell did you say that &lt;laugh&gt; that's dumb, right.

100
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.990
That that's the anxiety because there's a pause mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and that,

101
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.140
that, that could be, um, I don't know. I think it just pushes me to be better,

102
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.420
but maybe I could be way better if I would go that. Yeah.

103
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.580
It's scary to think that GSB, if you let go that.

104
00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.660
<v 1>Even better or did he have a, did, did he have a, like you're saying like,</v>

105
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.660
you don't necessarily feel those. So I think certain people that I've coached,

106
00:05:16.661 --> 00:05:20.660
like they would describe how they would feel literally to ring the wrestling

107
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.770
match. Right. And you're saying like during the,

108
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.930
the speech performance it's mostly gone. Yep. And that's so that's,

109
00:05:26.931 --> 00:05:30.130
it would be interesting to see if like, you know, he talked a lot about that,

110
00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:32.890
but if it was all, if it was all the way somehow gone and he,

111
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.450
and it means he would have a mechanism for it.

112
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.650
So like I had a really bad performance,

113
00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:38.970
my freshman year of high school and nationals, cuz I had,

114
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.360
I had the ability to be anxious and one of my coaches talked about like,

115
00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:45.920
and a lot of a, a personalities are kind of that way, you know,

116
00:05:45.921 --> 00:05:50.120
because they're trying to consider all possibilities at the same time. And, and,

117
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.040
and while we're actually performing or competing, it's negative to performance.

118
00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:54.960
Right. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um,

119
00:05:54.961 --> 00:05:59.600
so he said he would always leading up to the match within say an hour. He,

120
00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.840
his thing was talking about fishing.

121
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.120
He would get someone to talk about fishing with him.

122
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.120
Cause it would stop him thinking about the match and, and being Uber anxious.

123
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.160
So I always,

124
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.600
I kind really took that heart and it really helped me as I would always like

125
00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:10.240
have someone to talk to and just,

126
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.280
just goof around about whatever mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

127
00:06:12.281 --> 00:06:15.520
So I'm not thinking about this thing. And then once I step in it's time to go.

128
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.830
So I didn't have like anxious buildup and now it's not for me. I took it away.

129
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.310
But like me, you know, like you said, you have a way to get it away obviously.

130
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:23.990
Cause it's.

131
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.510
<v 0>Yeah. I, so I guess there's little, little tricks you come up with. Yeah.</v>

132
00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:27.870
You start thinking about, it's not fishing.

133
00:06:27.871 --> 00:06:31.030
Maybe I should try the fishing thing, but I hate fishing so boring.

134
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.270
&lt;laugh&gt; well maybe, maybe it's good to think about that. All right, Ben,

135
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.060
this is, uh, like I told you, I'm a big fan. I'm a big fan of your wrestling.

136
00:06:39.061 --> 00:06:42.580
You're fighting your personality. Uh, thank you for coming down.

137
00:06:42.581 --> 00:06:47.100
Thank you for talking today. Appreciate you honor. Bam. Let's go wrestle.
