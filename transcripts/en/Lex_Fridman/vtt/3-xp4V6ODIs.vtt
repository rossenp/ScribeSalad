00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.970
<v 0>Let me ask you about Travis, Kayla,</v>

2
00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:07.730
and maybe a few of the other athletes you've been involved with.

3
00:00:07.731 --> 00:00:11.810
So first Travis, Travis Stevens,

4
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.150
Olympic silver medalist, three time Olympian,

5
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.180
2008, 2012, 2016.

6
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.870
What makes Travis Stevens great.

7
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.420
What makes him so successful?

8
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.430
What makes him unique in your mind as an athlete through all the hardships he

9
00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:35.030
had to overcome through is a weird looking,

10
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.310
saying Augie that, uh, eventually worked out nicely through the,

11
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.390
the full richness of his personality in the context of all the other great

12
00:00:44.391 --> 00:00:46.670
athletes you've coached. What makes him special?

13
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.190
<v 1>His fight. Travis has fight and you know,</v>

14
00:00:52.191 --> 00:00:56.600
the first time I ever saw Travis Stevens was in like recognized him.

15
00:00:56.601 --> 00:00:59.000
Maybe I had seen him before as a younger boy or something,

16
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:03.920
but like actually recognized him is I brought a group of young kids to

17
00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:06.740
Italy for a competition in a training camp.

18
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.740
And it was this program called you 23 elite.

19
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.360
And I picked handpicked 20 kids to go to this event.

20
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.750
And it was the first time I coached, uh, an international team.

21
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.340
And I had never seen Travis fight before compete, train anything.

22
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.510
And during this competition, no, he's an 81 keel player.

23
00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:30.860
I think he was maybe like 18 years old, um, 17,

24
00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:34.430
18 years old. And it was a really hard European event.

25
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.850
And I think Travis won three matches and he lost two.

26
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.230
But what stood out the most to me was like the fight he had in him.

27
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.220
He was scrapping every fight. Like he scrapped hard.

28
00:01:46.221 --> 00:01:49.490
Like he wanted to win more than any of them. Right. He didn't win,

29
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.910
but he wanted to win more. And I, and I noticed that right away.

30
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.540
And then I also noticed that after he lost his second match and he was

31
00:01:56.541 --> 00:02:00.140
eliminated from the tournament, I saw how disappointed he wasn't himself.

32
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.260
Like he actually thought he was supposed to beat those people,

33
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.310
even though he was like 17, right. And he's fighting against grown men that are,

34
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.030
you know, a high level judo, much higher than he was. And I said to him, I said,

35
00:02:11.031 --> 00:02:15.200
Hey son, like, don't worry, man. You got a long career ahead of you. Like,

36
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.160
I'm glad you're disappointed, but there's so many things you don't know.

37
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.181
And so many skills,

38
00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:24.110
you don't have the fact that you were able to hold your own and scrap like that.

39
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.190
Like you've got a good future. And I remember calling my friend, Jason Morris,

40
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.820
after that tournament. And I said, Hey man, did you ever hear this kid?

41
00:02:31.821 --> 00:02:36.260
Travis Stevens? He says, no. Why? I said, man, that kid's got some fight in him.

42
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.513
Right. And I said that,

43
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.910
I said that to Jason at the time I said that kid's got some fight in him, man.

44
00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:44.810
He's pretty talented, you know? And that's how it started. Um,

45
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.430
but so I saw that I met when he was young, but the other thing was Travis.

46
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.330
Like there's no, there's no such thing as hard work to that guy.

47
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.420
If you tell him to put his head through the wall and I'll help.

48
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.730
And that's how he wins, he'll go put his head through the wall.

49
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.580
He'll do whatever it takes for him to do to achieve

50
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:04.414
success.

51
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.490
And he hates failure more than he

52
00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:14.470
likes winning 100%. He always has he punishes himself when he doesn't do well,

53
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.680
he makes himself work harder. He goes in, you know,

54
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.750
just on abuses himself when he doesn't, when he doesn't succeed,

55
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:25.900
because he's so heartbroken and disappointed in himself.

56
00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:29.350
So that's a trait that I think all of the athletes that I work with,

57
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.530
like closely though, they all had that same trait.

58
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.560
They hated losing more than anything. They would, they would break their arm.

59
00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:37.240
They'd fall on their head. You know,

60
00:03:37.241 --> 00:03:40.150
they'd rather get hit by a car than lose a judo tournament. Yeah.

61
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.470
And as a result, then they all had fight and they all were willing to train.

62
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:48.310
They were willing to listen and they would do anything for victory, you know,

63
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:49.750
within, you know, within the rules,

64
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:52.030
I'm not talking about taking drugs or anything like that, but they would,

65
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.430
they'd give a hundred percent of themselves for victory. And you know,

66
00:03:57.431 --> 00:04:00.880
Travis was somebody that when he was down, he found a way to do,

67
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.700
to get better doing something else. If he couldn't do standing,

68
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.790
that's when he started jujitsu, he couldn't go on his feet anymore.

69
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:09.400
He couldn't stand up and train. My mind was, well,

70
00:04:09.401 --> 00:04:12.970
go learn jujitsu and get good on the ground. Right. Because I can't, you know,

71
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:16.180
so he always found a way in, no matter what obstacle was in his way,

72
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.350
he just went around it.

73
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.760
<v 0>So what about the interesting to get your perspective?</v>

74
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.400
Because I know Travis has perspective is the,

75
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.980
just the number of injuries,

76
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.630
like what do you make of the perseverance through all the injuries you had to

77
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:33.100
overcome specifically?

78
00:04:33.101 --> 00:04:37.360
Like you just observing this creature that you've coached. I mean,

79
00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:41.560
he seems to not see the injuries as, as a problem. He just like,

80
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.300
just think you said head through the wall. It's like, what? Like when I,

81
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.180
when we were talking about injuries, he kinda,

82
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.190
he doesn't even see the injuries themselves as the problem because he thinks

83
00:04:54.191 --> 00:04:57.280
that the injuries, you know, you heal back stronger.

84
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.040
I forget the exact quote, but he said like, my body is,

85
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.760
is now less injury prone than most of anyone else, because.

86
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.593
<v 1>I've already broken.</v>

87
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.170
<v 0>Broken. And it was just growing back stronger. Like,</v>

88
00:05:11.171 --> 00:05:12.310
cause I asked him something like,

89
00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:16.900
do you regret sort of pushing your body to all of those places that

90
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:20.980
resulted in those injuries. And he was, his response was like, no,

91
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:25.570
I'm stronger now. Right. So I don't know if that's justification,

92
00:05:25.571 --> 00:05:28.630
but that certainly describes a mindset that yeah.

93
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.210
Head through the wall that doesn't, uh,

94
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.050
it's almost not dramatic. Like, look,

95
00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:39.730
I got this injury it's so I'm so like brave and special for overcoming this

96
00:05:39.731 --> 00:05:44.650
injury. He's just, he's just, that's part of the job. And he gets the job done.

97
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.110
But like that job of box a lottery.

98
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.790
<v 1>One of the talks I gave Travis and that team at that,</v>

99
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.540
at that particular tournament was at the very beginning of the camp after the

100
00:05:54.541 --> 00:05:58.250
tournament, I said to them, listen, my, my vision shared my vision with them.

101
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.780
I said, my vision is, you know, in seven years, cause that was 2005.

102
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:07.580
I said in seven years, I want to have a U S team that steps on the mat.

103
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.330
It is ready to kick. And in order to get there,

104
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.450
all of you guys can be a part of this team and part of this process.

105
00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:18.050
But in order to get there, you guys have to be the first ones to practice.

106
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.550
You have to be the last ones to leave.

107
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.480
Cause we have to work harder than the rest of the world because we're up against

108
00:06:23.481 --> 00:06:24.800
all odds. I said,

109
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.210
I am sick of America being a laughing stock of judo and being the first round,

110
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.930
easy match up for everybody else. I said,

111
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.190
if you get injured, you're not going to be on the side with, with, you know,

112
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.540
with an ice bag on taking off rounds and then get back on the mat the next day

113
00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:44.690
and tell me you're okay. If you can train the next day, you can train today.

114
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.890
So there's no injury.

115
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:49.430
The only time you'll leave in this dojo is if the ambulance has to take you out

116
00:06:49.431 --> 00:06:50.720
of here, you know? And I,

117
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.640
and I do think subliminally Travis bought into that message and heard that

118
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:57.990
message. Then instead of I'm going to be a champion,

119
00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.610
that's the way I'm going to do it. And he did. And he, he embodied it.

120
00:07:01.611 --> 00:07:06.470
He lived it, man. There were many times in Europe where I said, dude,

121
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.950
just tape it up. I'll go off to the side. Just take the day off.

122
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:12.860
Like take the rest of the day off. You're beat up. You can't do it. He's not,

123
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.070
I'm going to tape it up on the two belts. No, you don't need to right now.

124
00:07:16.071 --> 00:07:17.570
And he said, no sensei, I'm doing it.

125
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.280
You know the ambulance isn't taking me out. It just my, just my wrist.

126
00:07:22.281 --> 00:07:25.010
It's just my ankle. It's just my chest, my ankle.

127
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.520
<v 0>You know? It's. Yeah. I love it. Yeah. What about the,</v>

128
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:32.690
so the other really big thing is you comment on a little bit,

129
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.330
is the weight cut so early in his career,

130
00:07:35.331 --> 00:07:40.250
he was 81 kg and that was presumably not so

131
00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:42.170
difficult, but later in his career,

132
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:46.250
he is 81 kg and it's becoming more and more difficult.

133
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.720
So that's, that's the other thing with him is, uh,

134
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.880
so I've known a lot of really,

135
00:07:52.881 --> 00:07:56.330
really tough people at the highest levels broken by the way, cut,

136
00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:01.070
like that can break the toughest minds and it doesn't seem to have broken him

137
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:06.530
and he's delivered on it often on like insane weight cuts.

138
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.500
So, um, just as a coach,

139
00:08:09.501 --> 00:08:13.070
what do you think about his particularly his mind and the challenge of the way

140
00:08:13.071 --> 00:08:13.904
cut.

141
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.890
<v 1>It was part of his process.</v>

142
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.370
It was part of his way of getting ready for battle suffering.

143
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:23.720
It really was. And if I'm going to suffer this much,

144
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:27.380
then I'm going to make my opponents pay for all the suffering that I went

145
00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:30.590
through to get here. That was his mindset, um,

146
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.820
later on in his career you're right. Like a lot of times Travis,

147
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.210
he would never step on a scale, you know, until he got to the tournament,

148
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:43.100
you know, and even when he get to the tournament, uh, he'd weigh like 90 heels.

149
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:47.540
He'd show up at the tournament, nine kilos over I'm like, you know, you have to,

150
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.810
but I never, it was just an expectation of making weight,

151
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.230
not making weight was never an option for any of our athletes.

152
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:58.350
And Travis knew it. And he said, as a professional,

153
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:02.190
my job is to make weight. If I don't make weight, he, you know, he,

154
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.290
he was never gonna allow that to happen.

155
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:08.160
And he was never going to allow us to come to him and say, Hey, I told you,

156
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:12.150
you know, cause he losing, wasn't an option, making a weight.

157
00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:16.080
Wasn't not making weight was not an option for him ever either. But you know,

158
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:20.010
a lot of times he wouldn't even, he'd be nine kilos over on the plane,

159
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:23.820
going over to the tournament and have to make wait three days later, you know?

160
00:09:23.821 --> 00:09:28.170
And he didn't break 86 kilos until the day before the tournament.

161
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:31.230
But he had five kilos over the day before that was his way.

162
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.400
But he would do three workouts. You know, the wake up in the morning workout,

163
00:09:35.401 --> 00:09:38.160
then he'd eat. Then he worked out in the afternoon, then he'd eat again.

164
00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:41.580
Then he he'd work out again at night and then he'd reward himself. Hey,

165
00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:44.940
I worked out three times today. He'd go have a, you know, a, a mountain Dew,

166
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.990
you know, or chocolate bar, you know, and then he's next morning,

167
00:09:48.991 --> 00:09:53.880
he's back up to 87 and he would never touch wait until

168
00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:57.490
the morning of lands. That that's when he,

169
00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:01.290
that he wasn't on weight for more than like five minutes.

170
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.420
<v 0>His process will break a lot of people. So the fact that he got the job done is.</v>

171
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.430
<v 1>Not just the job done,</v>

172
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:13.110
but every single time he got the job done and I made those athletes fight.

173
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.120
We would fight in Paris.

174
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.600
We would do a camp for a week double session camp for a week.

175
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:22.920
He'd be seven kilos over half the fight. The next weekend,

176
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:27.240
we're talking two or three days later. So not only did he make the weight,

177
00:10:27.241 --> 00:10:32.100
but he did a grueling training camp twice a day and then cut weight and

178
00:10:32.101 --> 00:10:32.934
then fought again.

179
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:37.020
Then did another camp for a week in double session training camp and then fought

180
00:10:37.021 --> 00:10:41.010
on a third weekend in a row. And our athletes went through hell. You know,

181
00:10:41.011 --> 00:10:45.510
all of our athletes went through hell because on the tour, around the world,

182
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:49.800
they fought in every event, they did every camp. They fought in every event.

183
00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.850
Whereas most of the other teams like Japan comes in and fights in Paris.

184
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:57.000
Then they go home. They maybe do a camp for three days. Then they go home.

185
00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:01.020
They don't stay in Europe for four or five weeks straight and fighting every

186
00:11:01.021 --> 00:11:04.920
tournament. And when you get to Germany, the Germans skipped the French open.

187
00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.560
They skipped the camp in France. They're just getting ready for Germany.

188
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.740
Our athletes already had two competitions, two training camps,

189
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.290
two with three-way cuts now. And then,

190
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.570
so they're not a hundred percent when they fight in Germany,

191
00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:19.650
but that's all part of the experience. They need the training that they need,

192
00:11:19.651 --> 00:11:21.810
that they don't get here in the, in, in this country.

193
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:26.370
And all of those would just preparation for a world championships or Olympic

194
00:11:26.371 --> 00:11:29.490
games. So by the time our athletes got to those tournaments,

195
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:33.540
they felt so strong. So rested. So like, man,

196
00:11:33.541 --> 00:11:36.600
this guy that felt like a monster in Germany,

197
00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:40.320
he feels like nothing today because you're fully rested now, you know.

198
00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:45.690
<v 0>But part of the challenge is because the American team is smaller and more,</v>

199
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:49.410
I mean, just smaller is, um, you know,

200
00:11:49.411 --> 00:11:54.280
all the different places you go for to do the weight, cut, to do the diet,

201
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.250
to do the preparation or the recovery.

202
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.660
There's like that process changes every time.

203
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.500
So you basically have to improvise a lot. Oh yeah.

204
00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:09.650
You show up to a hotel and how you do the Waco. You don't know, and this,

205
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.330
the different weather conditions, it's not, it's like, um,

206
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.530
so what is it Rocky versus Drago, right? So you don't have,

207
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.790
you have to just improvise.

208
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.300
And that's also a fascinating part of the American judo story, which is like,

209
00:12:22.301 --> 00:12:23.350
you have to improvise more.

210
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:27.940
<v 1>Well, I was funny cause when I was 1990 and it was at the Goodwill games.</v>

211
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.990
Right. And uh, we were, it was a U S Olympic committee type event.

212
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:37.000
And so we're on the bus with the swim team and it was me and Jason Morris on the

213
00:12:37.001 --> 00:12:39.700
American team. And we're going to the judo competition,

214
00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.000
but we're on the bus with the swim team. Uh,

215
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:43.930
so we're going through the venue where we're staying.

216
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:48.310
And I remember being like by ourselves with no staff, no, no, no manager,

217
00:12:48.311 --> 00:12:52.690
no coach. We're just by ourselves going to fight in Russia. Right. And uh,

218
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.300
in the swim teams on their,

219
00:12:55.301 --> 00:12:58.860
with their full sweats and their staff and like their managers. And I,

220
00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:03.010
I heard the lady, the girl go, oh, sorry, this is 1994. Cause it was in St.

221
00:13:03.011 --> 00:13:07.210
Petersburg, Russia. So I heard the girl on the team, she goes up to the coach.

222
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.133
He goes, coach. Um,

223
00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:11.860
do you think he can send the massage therapist to my room at 10:00 AM? You know,

224
00:13:11.861 --> 00:13:15.400
I'm feeling kind of jet lag. I looked at Jason,

225
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.550
[inaudible] like still

226
00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:23.950
beside it won't even have a staff. Like what the hell is going on here?

227
00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.550
You know, what a difference in yeah. Sporting, you know,

228
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.460
different sports within the same country, you know?

229
00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.580
<v 0>I mean, not the romanticized things,</v>

230
00:13:33.581 --> 00:13:38.180
but that you do represent the spirit of the Olympics when you're kind of the,

231
00:13:38.181 --> 00:13:42.820
the improvisational nature of it. Cause it, it is just you,

232
00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:47.290
you and sometimes you and the coach and just pure guts

233
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:52.150
and you against the world with no money, the warrior spirit,

234
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:53.140
the warrior spirit.
