1
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.250
<v 0>Without taking cheap political shots. Can we talk about COVID-19?</v>

2
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.070
How will history remember the COVID-19 pandemic?

3
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.040
What were the successes with?

4
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.860
What were the failures of leadership of,

5
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.300
of man of humans?

6
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.630
<v 1>Doom was a book that I was planning to write</v>

7
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.620
before the pandemic struck as a history of,

8
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.070
of the future based in large measure on science-fiction.

9
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.390
It had occurred to me in 2019 that I had spent too long,

10
00:00:38.391 --> 00:00:39.620
not reading science fiction.

11
00:00:39.621 --> 00:00:43.580
And so I decided I would live not my,

12
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.070
my intake by getting off history for a bit and reading science fiction,

13
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.060
because history is great at telling you about the perennial problems with power.

14
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.550
Putin is always interesting on history.

15
00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.290
He's become something of a historian recently with, uh, his essays and lectures,

16
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.840
but what history is bad at telling you is, well,

17
00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:06.290
what will the effects of this continuity of technology be?

18
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.620
And so I thought I need some science fiction to think more about this.

19
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:10.470
Cause I'm, I'm,

20
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.140
I'm tending to miss the importance of technological discontinuity.

21
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.630
If you read a lot of science fiction, you read a lot of, of plagued books.

22
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.010
Cause uh, science fiction writers are really quite fond of the plagues scenario.

23
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.710
So the world ends in many ways in science fiction,

24
00:01:27.711 --> 00:01:30.440
but one of the most popular is the lethal pandemic. So when,

25
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.740
when the first email came to me,

26
00:01:33.741 --> 00:01:36.860
I think it was on January the third from my medical friend, Justin stabbing,

27
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.900
funny pneumonia and Wu Han.

28
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.190
My antenna began to tingle because it was just like

29
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.910
one of those science fiction books that begins. And just that way

30
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.010
in a pandemic as Larry brilliant,

31
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.000
the epidemiologist said many years ago,

32
00:01:56.001 --> 00:02:00.140
the key is early detection and early action.

33
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.420
That's how you deal with a novel pathogen

34
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.630
and almost no Western country to that.

35
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.820
We know it was doable because the time and ease and the south Koreans did it and

36
00:02:10.821 --> 00:02:15.740
they did it very well, but really no Western country got this right.

37
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.050
Some were unlucky because super spreader events happened earlier than in other

38
00:02:21.051 --> 00:02:24.620
countries. Italy was hit very hard, very early for other countries.

39
00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:26.720
The real disaster came quite late. Russia,

40
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.070
which has only relatively recently had a really bad experience.

41
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.190
The lesson for me is quite different from the one that most journalists

42
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.990
thought they were learning last year.

43
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.220
Most journalists last year thought Trump is a terrible president.

44
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.440
He's seeing a lot of crazy things.

45
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.550
It's his fault that we have high access mortality in the United States.

46
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.960
The same argument was being made by journalists in Britain, Boris Johnson,

47
00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:58.130
dot.dot Brazil, Joe Ballston, scenario.dot dot, even India,

48
00:02:58.131 --> 00:03:00.610
Narendra Modi, the same argument.

49
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.440
And I think this argument is wrong in a few ways.

50
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.720
It's true that the populous leaders said many crazy things and

51
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.040
ball Rodley speaking gave poor guidance to their, their populations.

52
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.900
But I don't think it's true to say that with different leaders,

53
00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:22.180
these countries would have done significantly better.

54
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.660
If Joe Biden had magically been president a year early,

55
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.290
I don't think the us would have done much better because the things that caused

56
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.290
excess mortality last year, weren't presidential decisions.

57
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:37.060
They were auto failure of CDC to provide testing that definitely wasn't

58
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:40.180
Trump's fault. Scott Gottlieb spook makes that very clear.

59
00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:41.500
It's just been published recently.

60
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.280
We utterly failed to use technology for contact tracing,

61
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.110
which the Koreans did very well.

62
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.370
We didn't really quarantine anybody seriously.

63
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.350
There was no enforcement of quarantine and we exposed the elderly to the virus

64
00:03:56.351 --> 00:04:00.970
as quickly as possible and elderly care homes and feats things very little to do

65
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:02.470
with presidential and competence.

66
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.200
So I think leadership is of somewhat marginal

67
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:09.940
importance in a crisis like this,

68
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.240
because what you really need is your public health bureaucracy to get it right.

69
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.480
And very few Western public health bureaucracies. Got it right.

70
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.220
Could the president have given better leadership? Yes.

71
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.340
His correct strategy, however,

72
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.960
was to learn from Barack Obama's playbook with the opioid

73
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.003
epidemic,

74
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.260
the opioid epidemic killed as many people on Obama's watch as COVID

75
00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:36.190
did on Trump's watch.

76
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.230
And it was worse in the sense because it only happened in the U S and each year.

77
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.780
It killed more people than the year before over eight years,

78
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.090
nobody to my knowledge ever seriously blamed Obama for the opioid epidemic.

79
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.190
Trump's mistake was to put himself front and center of the response to claim

80
00:04:54.191 --> 00:04:58.990
that he had some unique insight into the pandemic and to say with

81
00:04:58.991 --> 00:05:03.580
every passing week more and more foolish things until even a significant

82
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:07.300
portion of people who'd voted for him in 2016, realized that he'd blown it,

83
00:05:07.301 --> 00:05:08.620
which was why he lost the election.

84
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.320
The correct strategy was actually to make Mike Pence the pandemic SAR

85
00:05:14.321 --> 00:05:17.980
and get the hell out of the way. That's what my advice to Trump would have been.

86
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:22.960
In fact, it was in February of last year. So the mistake was to,

87
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.850
to try to lead, but actually leadership in a pandemics,

88
00:05:27.851 --> 00:05:29.290
almost a contradiction in terms,

89
00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:33.160
what you really need is your public health bureaucracy, not to it up.

90
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.170
And he really, really it up. And that was then all blamed on Trump. You know,

91
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:41.020
Jim Fallows writes a piece in the Atlantic that says, well,

92
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.440
being the president's like flying a light aircraft, it's pilot error. And I,

93
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.510
I read that piece and I thought, does he really?

94
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:48.310
After all the years he spent writing,

95
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.700
think that being president is like flying a light aircraft. I mean,

96
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.080
it's really nothing like flying a light aircraft being present is you sit on top

97
00:05:56.081 --> 00:06:00.560
of a vast with how many different agencies, 60, 70, we've all lost count.

98
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.970
And you're surrounded by advisors. At least a quarter of whom are saying,

99
00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:06.980
this is a disaster. We have to close the borders.

100
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:09.920
And then the others are saying, no, no, we have to keep the economy going.

101
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:11.450
That's what you're running on in November.

102
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.180
So being a president in a pandemic is a very unenviable position, uh,

103
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.710
because you actually can't,

104
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.850
you can't really determine whether your public health bureaucracy will get it

105
00:06:22.851 --> 00:06:23.640
right or not.

106
00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.650
<v 0>You don't think the pushback on that just like being Churchill in a war is</v>

107
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:32.120
difficult. So leaving Trump by in the side,

108
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.680
but I would love to see from a president is somebody who makes

109
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.660
great speeches and arouses the public to push the bureaucracy,

110
00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:44.780
the public health bureaucracy, to get their together,

111
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.900
to fire certain kinds of people to do. I mean, I'm sorry,

112
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:50.360
but I'm a big fan of powerful speeches,

113
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.560
especially in the modern age with the internet. It can really move people.

114
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:55.603
Instead.

115
00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.230
The lack of speeches resulted in certain kinds of

116
00:07:00.231 --> 00:07:02.660
forces, uh,

117
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.590
amplifying division over whether it was wear masks or not,

118
00:07:06.591 --> 00:07:08.480
or all it's like, it's,

119
00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:12.050
it's almost like the public pick some random topic over which to divide

120
00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:15.020
themselves. And there was like a, a complete indecision,

121
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.170
which is really what it was fear of the, uh,

122
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.500
of uncertainty materializing itself in some kind of division.

123
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.910
And then you almost like busy yourself with the red versus blue politics,

124
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.980
as opposed to some, I don't know, FDR type character just stands and say,

125
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.090
uh, all this that we're hearing,

126
00:07:35.091 --> 00:07:39.530
we're going to manufacture 5 billion tests. This is what America is great at.

127
00:07:39.531 --> 00:07:44.360
We're going to build the greatest testing infrastructure ever built or

128
00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.540
something, or even with the vaccine development.

129
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.290
<v 1>What I was about to interject yes. In a pandemic,</v>

130
00:07:51.291 --> 00:07:54.620
the most important thing is the vaccine. If you get that right,

131
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.510
then you should be forgiven for much else.

132
00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.770
And that was the one thing that Trump administration got, right? Because, uh,

133
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:05.300
they went around the bureaucracy with operation warp speed and achieved a

134
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.280
really major success.

135
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:12.470
So I think the paradox of, of the,

136
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.930
the 2020 story in the United States is that the one thing that mattered

137
00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:22.850
most the Trump administration got right. And it got so much else wrong.

138
00:08:22.851 --> 00:08:26.870
That was sort of marginal that we were left with the impression that Trump had

139
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:32.000
been to blame for the whole disaster, which wasn't really quite right. Sure.

140
00:08:32.001 --> 00:08:34.730
It would have been great if we did operation warp speed for testing,

141
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.660
but ultimately vaccines are more important than tests. And

142
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.080
this brings me to the question that,

143
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:46.490
that you raised there of polarization and why that happened

144
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:49.190
now in a book called the square and the tower,

145
00:08:49.191 --> 00:08:54.110
I argued that it would be very costly for the United States to allow the public

146
00:08:54.111 --> 00:08:54.441
sphere,

147
00:08:54.441 --> 00:08:58.470
to continue be dominated by a handful of big tech companies that this ultimately

148
00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:02.610
would have more adverse effects than simply contested elections.

149
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.480
And I think we saw over the past 18 months, uh,

150
00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.010
just how bad this could be,

151
00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:12.960
because the odd thing about this country

152
00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:17.040
is that we came up with vaccines with 90 plus percent efficacy,

153
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.390
and about 20% of people refuse to get them and still do refuse

154
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.730
for reasons that seem best explained

155
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.430
in terms of the anti-vax network,

156
00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:32.130
which has been embedded on the internet for a long time,

157
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:37.380
predating the pandemic rendered arrests or wrote about this pre 2020.

158
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:38.180
And this,

159
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.570
this anti-vax network has turned that to kill maybe 200,000 Americans who could

160
00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:43.440
have been vaccinated,

161
00:09:43.441 --> 00:09:47.880
but were persuaded through magical thinking that the vaccine was riskier

162
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:52.140
than the virus. Whereas you don't need to be an epidemiologist.

163
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.560
You don't need to be a medical scientist to know that the virus is at about two

164
00:09:55.561 --> 00:10:00.330
orders of magnitude riskier than the vaccine. So again,

165
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.500
leadership could definitely have been better,

166
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:10.080
but the politicization of everything was not Trump's doing

167
00:10:10.081 --> 00:10:10.680
alone.

168
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:15.300
It happened because our public sphere has been dominated by a

169
00:10:15.301 --> 00:10:19.980
handful of platforms whose business model inherently

170
00:10:19.981 --> 00:10:21.180
promotes polarization,

171
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:25.320
inherently promotes fake news and extreme views because those are the things

172
00:10:25.321 --> 00:10:28.650
that get the eyeballs and the screens and sell the ads. I mean,

173
00:10:28.651 --> 00:10:29.760
this is now commonplace,

174
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.470
but when one thinks about the cost of allowing this, uh,

175
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.760
kind of thing to happen, it's now a very high human cost.

176
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:43.890
And we were finished to leave uncorrected these structural problems in the

177
00:10:43.891 --> 00:10:47.520
public sphere that were already very clearly visible in 2016.
