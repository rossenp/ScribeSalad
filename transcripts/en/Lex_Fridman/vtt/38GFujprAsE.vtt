WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.960
<v 0>Can I ask you about the big bang? Uh,</v>

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.080
so we talked about the space and time are really big mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

3
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.760
but then, and we,

4
00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:15.240
humans give a lot of meaning to the word space and time in our,

5
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.120
in our like daily lives.

6
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.590
But then can we talk about this moment of beginning and how supposed to

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.310
think about it, that at the moment of the big bang, everything was,

8
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.390
uh, what like infinitely small and then it just blew up.

9
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.510
<v 1>We have to be careful here, cuz there's a, uh, there's a,</v>

10
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.830
a common misconception that the big,

11
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.020
tha the big bang is like the explosion of a bomb in empty space that,

12
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.700
that, uh, fills up the surrounding place. It is space. It is. Yeah.

13
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.860
As, as we understand it, it's the fact it's the,

14
00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.220
the, the fact or the, the hypothesis, but well supported up to a point the,

15
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.730
that, uh, that everywhere in the whole universe,

16
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.610
early in the history, uh, matter came together into a very hot,

17
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.450
very dense. If you run it backwards in time matter,

18
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:20.170
comes together into a very hot, very dense and yet very homogeneous, uh,

19
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.280
plasma of all the different kinds of elementary particles and quirks and

20
00:01:25.281 --> 00:01:28.880
Antiqua and glue ones and photons and electrons and anti electrons, everything,

21
00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:33.120
you know, all of that stuff like really hot, really, really,

22
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.520
really hot we're talking about, uh, way, way hotter than the surface of the sun.

23
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.200
Uh, you know, well, in fact, if you take the equations, as we,

24
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.230
as they come, the, the prediction is that the temperature just goes to infinity,

25
00:01:49.231 --> 00:01:53.230
but then the equations, uh, break down. We don't, you know, we don't,

26
00:01:53.231 --> 00:01:58.190
don't really, there are various, the equations become infinity equals infinity,

27
00:01:58.191 --> 00:02:02.150
so they don't feel it's called a singularity. We don't really know, uh,

28
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.750
this is running the equations backwards.

29
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.820
So you can't get a sensible idea of what happened before the big bang we don't.

30
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:13.180
And I, so we need different equations to address the very earliest moments,

31
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.820
uh, that, uh, but so

32
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.740
things were hotter and denser.

33
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.700
We don't really know why things started out that way. We do,

34
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.810
we, you have a lot of evidence that they did start out that way. Uh,

35
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.770
but since most of the, uh,

36
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.130
you know, we don't get to visit there &lt;laugh&gt; and do controlled experiments.

37
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.370
Most, most of the, most of the record is, is very, very processed. And, uh,

38
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.680
we have to, we have to use, uh, very, uh,

39
00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:52.480
subtle techniques and powerful instruments to,

40
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.760
to get information that has survived.

41
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.200
<v 0>Get closer and closer to the big bang, get.</v>

42
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.040
<v 1>Closer and closer to the, the, the beginning of things. And</v>

43
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.280
what's revealed there is that, uh, as I said, there,

44
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.200
there undoubtedly was a period when everything in the universe that we have

45
00:03:13.201 --> 00:03:15.800
been able to look at and understand,

46
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.430
and that's consistent with everything is, uh, um,

47
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.150
the was in a condition where it was much, much.

48
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.030
<v 0>Hotter and much, much denser, uh,</v>

49
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.590
but still obeying the laws of physics as we know them today. And,

50
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.990
and then you start with that. So all the matter is in equilibrium

51
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.860
and then with small quantum fluctuations and run it forward,

52
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.580
and then it produces in at least in broad strokes,

53
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.180
the universe we see around us today, do you think we'll ever be able to,

54
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.860
with the tools of physics with the way science is with the way the human mind

55
00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.340
is,

56
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.090
will ever be able to get to the moment of the big bang in our understanding,

57
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.850
or even the moment before the big bang?

58
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.810
Can we understand what happened before the big.

59
00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.050
<v 1>Bang I'm, I'm optimistic,</v>

60
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.730
both that will be able to, uh,

61
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.730
measure more so observe more,

62
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.440
and that we'll be able to figure out more. So, uh, they're very,

63
00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:27.520
very tangible prospects for, uh,

64
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.240
observing the extremely early universe so much,

65
00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:34.440
even much earlier than we can observe now, uh,

66
00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:38.600
through looking at gravitational waves, gravitational waves,

67
00:04:38.601 --> 00:04:43.270
since they interact. So with ordinary matter, uh,

68
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.710
sort of send an UN, uh, a minimally processed SIM signal from the big bang.

69
00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.710
It's a very weak signal because it's traveled a long way and diffused over long

70
00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:55.310
spaces, but, uh,

71
00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.150
but people are gearing up to try to detect gravitational waves that could have

72
00:05:00.151 --> 00:05:01.740
come from the early unit. Yeah.

73
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.660
<v 0>Ligos incredible engineering project. It's just the most sensitive,</v>

74
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:07.980
precise yes.

75
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.260
Devices on the fact that humans can build something like that is, uh,

76
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.980
truly all inspiring from an engineering.

77
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.620
<v 1>Perspective, right? And,</v>

78
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.370
but these gravitational ways from the early universe would probably be of a much

79
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.210
longer wavelength than LICO is capable of sensing.

80
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.810
So there's a beautiful project. Uh,

81
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.610
that's contemplated to put lasers in

82
00:05:36.611 --> 00:05:39.970
different par different locations in the solar system. Mm-hmm,

83
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.760
&lt;affirmative&gt; you, we really, really separated by, uh,

84
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.000
solar system scale differences, like,

85
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.840
like artificial planets or moons in different places and,

86
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.320
and see the tiny motions of those relatives to one another, as a signal of,

87
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.240
of radiation for the big bang.

88
00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.200
We can also maybe indirectly see the imprint

89
00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.000
of gravitational waves from the early universe on, uh,

90
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.880
the photons, the, the microwave background, radiation,

91
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.240
that that is our present way of, of seeing into the earliest universe.

92
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.360
But those, those photons interact much more strong, matter,

93
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.110
much more strongly processed.

94
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.630
So they don't give us directly such an unprocessed

95
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.830
view of the early universe of the very early universe.

96
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.750
But if gravitational waves leave some imprint on that,

97
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.630
as they move through, uh, we could detect that too. And people are trying are,

98
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.260
you know, as we speak, &lt;laugh&gt; working very hard towards, uh,

99
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:41.500
towards that goal.

100
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.140
<v 0>It's so exciting to think about a sensor, the size of a solar system, like, uh,</v>

101
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.660
too, that that.

102
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.700
<v 1>Would be a fantastic, I mean,</v>

103
00:06:48.701 --> 00:06:52.060
that would be a pinnacle artifact of human endeavor.

104
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.500
To me that would be such, uh, you know,

105
00:06:55.501 --> 00:06:59.130
such an inspiring thing that we want to know.

106
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:05.010
And we go to these extraordinary lengths of making gigantic things that are also

107
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.610
very sophisticated, because what you're trying to do, you,

108
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.890
you have to understand how they move. You have to understand the, uh,

109
00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.290
the properties of light that, that are being used,

110
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.250
the interference between light and,

111
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.400
and you have to be able to make the light with lasers and understand the quantum

112
00:07:20.401 --> 00:07:23.480
theory and get the timing exactly. Right. You know,

113
00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:27.720
it's an extraordinary endeavor involving all kinds of knowledge from the very

114
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.960
strong, very small to the very large and all in the service of,

115
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.840
uh, curiosity and built on a grand scale. So yeah,

116
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:43.230
it would. Yeah. So it make me proud to be a human. If we, if we, if we did.

117
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.190
<v 0>That, I love that you inspired both by,</v>

118
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.790
by the power of theory and the power of experiments. So this is the both,

119
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:49.910
both I think are,

120
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:55.030
are exceptionally impressive that the human mind can come up with theories

121
00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.230
that give us a peak into how the universe works,

122
00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:02.820
but also construct tools that are way bigger than, uh,

123
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.140
the, the evolutionary origins we came from. Right.

124
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.260
<v 1>And by the way, you know,</v>

125
00:08:07.261 --> 00:08:10.740
the fact that we can design those things and they work yeah.

126
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:15.500
Is an extraordinary demonstration that we really do understand a lot

127
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:16.933
&lt;laugh&gt;. And.

128
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:17.940
<v 0>Then in, in some ways.</v>

129
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:23.250
<v 1>And it's our ability to answer questions that also leads us to be able to</v>

130
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:24.850
address more ambitious questions.
