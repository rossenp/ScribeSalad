00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.610
<v 0>We live in a world. Now I've often in my own work,</v>

2
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.650
I hear about this concept of work life balance or overtraining.

3
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.210
So you've been one of the hardest workers ever on the mat.

4
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.610
You've coached some of the hardest workers ever.

5
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.050
Do you think it's possible to overtrain train too much?

6
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.850
How big of a concern is it? I think.

7
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.640
<v 1>Peeking and burnout are frames of mind or burnout is a,</v>

8
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.790
is a,

9
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.760
like you let things probably get to the point where you could have arrested them

10
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.960
with a good frame of mind. Um, but peeking is a frame of mind and, you know,

11
00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:40.680
you have to know, be able to read and that's a lot of it.

12
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.230
And the individual athlete also has to know that it's a frame of mind.

13
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:47.990
<v 2>And so when you have a coach,</v>

14
00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:52.430
that's reading that the right way and you have an athlete that is

15
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.470
knowing that it, when zero hour comes, you're gonna be ready to go. Um,

16
00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.750
and knowing that there's light at the end of the tunnel,

17
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.230
if you feel like you're burning, that can at both ends,

18
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.140
light's coming at to the end at, at the end of the tunnel. I mean,

19
00:01:05.141 --> 00:01:05.974
you're good to go.

20
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.460
<v 0>So you think about Gable and that whole dream of being carried</v>

21
00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:14.220
off the mat, because you worked so hard and again,

22
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.780
do you think it's possible to overtrain? So you said it's, uh, it's mental.

23
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.860
<v 1>I do think it's possible to overtrain if you have a lot of distractions. So,</v>

24
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.260
and if you're looking at your watch running out of the room, right.

25
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.850
&lt;affirmative&gt; then yeah, you're gonna that frame of mind,

26
00:01:27.851 --> 00:01:31.850
isn't gonna lend itself to excellency. And the thing is, is we,

27
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.770
we have to accomplish what we need to get accomplished and get better every day.

28
00:01:35.771 --> 00:01:37.890
You can't kind of accomplish what you need accomplish.

29
00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:41.810
You have to accomplish it. And when, when you're in that mindset,

30
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.050
then the clock is irrelevant, right? There's no place for,

31
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.920
for a clock in the wrestling room, right. And maybe a clock that times a match,

32
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.280
but, and maybe a clock, if you know, we're, we're at student athletes here,

33
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.960
but that's why we encourage our, you know, when, when you schedule your classes,

34
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.080
that you don't have a class that comes right up to,

35
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.390
you know, practice time or starts as a night class. And it starts at five 30,

36
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.750
you know, go to get the six 30 class or the seven o'clock. So.

37
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.550
<v 0>You leave it all behind your heart, your passion's completely.</v>

38
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.950
<v 1>And it there's no problem. And when you walk in that wrestling room,</v>

39
00:02:15.951 --> 00:02:18.790
there's no distractions and it's never eternal.

40
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.190
The only thing that's eternal is death. You know, there's nothing.

41
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.740
Sometimes guys come in there and they wig out, oh,

42
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.420
it's an hour and 25 minutes. Oh.

43
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.660
Or an hour and 45 minutes. Oh.

44
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.140
<v 0>Yeah. You have to be willing to go. As long as it takes. There's no clock.</v>

45
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.700
There's.

46
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.100
<v 1>No clock.</v>
