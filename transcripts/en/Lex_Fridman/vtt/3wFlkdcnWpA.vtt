00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.850
<v 0>It's funny there, there's probably echoes that represent the,</v>

2
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.290
the 20th century now in, uh, old man in the sea,

3
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.650
a Hemingway that, uh, also has similar,

4
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.530
I guess, themes, but more, um,

5
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.130
more personal mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; more focused on the, I mean,

6
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.520
I guess it's less about God is almost more like the existential version of mob

7
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.720
Dick. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And hence shorter.

8
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.840
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; and a lot shorter. Yeah. Well, Hemingway was brilliant that way. Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.320
<v 0>Uh, but do you see echoes and, uh, do, do you find old man in the sea?</v>

10
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.640
Interesting. It's.

11
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.200
<v 1>Been since ninth grade that I old man in the sea even longer ago than the</v>

12
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.590
fountain. Uh, so I didn't know we were going go there. I mean,

13
00:00:46.591 --> 00:00:48.870
I find Hemingway interesting, but Hemingway,

14
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.870
my general sort of picture of him is that, you know, he's,

15
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.830
he's, uh, we have to confront the, the dangers and the difficulties of our life.

16
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.750
We have to develop in ourselves a certain kind of courage and Manliness.

17
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.980
And I think there's something interesting about that.

18
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.900
He's for risk in a certain way. And I think that's important.

19
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.620
Uh, but I, but I do, I don't now I,

20
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.340
I don't have any right to say this since it's been so long since I read it. I,

21
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.620
I do feel like there's there's I don't remember

22
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.930
a sense for the, for quite the tragedy of it. Maybe there is,

23
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.290
is it a melancholy novel? I don't even remember. No.

24
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.090
<v 0>It's, uh, I mean,</v>

25
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.570
it has a sense of like the stranger by Kamoo has a sense of like,

26
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:40.170
this is how life is. Yeah. And it, like,

27
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.770
it has more about old age and that, uh,

28
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.040
you're not quite the man you used to be feeling of like,

29
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.360
this is how time passes and then the,

30
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.120
the passing of time and how you get old and you get older and this is one

31
00:01:57.121 --> 00:02:01.680
last fish it's, it's less about, this is the fish. Yeah. It's more like,

32
00:02:01.681 --> 00:02:03.600
this is one last fish like,

33
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.870
and asking who was I,

34
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.870
who was I as a man, as a human being in this world.

35
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.350
And this one fish helps you ask that question fully.

36
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.070
<v 1>Wonderful, but it's one fish,</v>

37
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.070
which is just sort of all the other fish too. Right. And,

38
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.110
and that is a big difference because for, for Ahab,

39
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.380
other fish will do than Moby Dick. It's gotta be the biggest, the most powerful,

40
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.180
the most tormenting.

41
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.540
It's gotta be the one that you've got history with that has filed you.

42
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.220
And it it's, uh, it's AOUS ride Moby Dick.
