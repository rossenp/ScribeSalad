00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.830
<v 0>Do you think psychedelics that I just mentioned earlier,</v>

2
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.960
have a possibility of going to these

3
00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:16.520
kind of same kind of places of

4
00:00:16.521 --> 00:00:20.630
exploring ideas that are outside of our, um,

5
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.560
more commonplace understanding of the world?

6
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.910
<v 1>Um, in my, yeah, I think so. Absolutely. However,</v>

7
00:00:28.911 --> 00:00:33.830
I think we have to be really careful about those because young people or people

8
00:00:33.831 --> 00:00:37.730
in general, I should say absolutely can get hurt by them. I mean,

9
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.380
but we get hurt by alcohol. You know,

10
00:00:39.381 --> 00:00:42.320
we drive our cars and we get kill each other. Um,

11
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.760
but psychedelics are really interesting because I know that within the history

12
00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:49.610
of, of our country, um,

13
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.890
we have used psychedelics in various capacities for our military in

14
00:00:54.891 --> 00:00:59.270
order to try to stimulate ideas and access places and

15
00:00:59.271 --> 00:01:03.830
information that can't be accessed. Normally this is all fact.

16
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.310
<v 0>Yeah. I talked to Matt for like four hours.</v>

17
00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:09.170
So we ran out of time being able to talk well,

18
00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:14.120
I wanted to talk to him about MK ultra and, um, Ted Kaczynski.

19
00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:16.100
There's so many mysterious things there.

20
00:01:16.101 --> 00:01:20.510
There's like layers of what's known and what's not known as fascinating,

21
00:01:20.511 --> 00:01:22.820
but I think what is interesting is, uh,

22
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.590
psychedelics were used the word attempted to be used as tools of different

23
00:01:27.591 --> 00:01:29.570
kinds. That's the point.

24
00:01:29.571 --> 00:01:34.010
So like we think of technology as tools, uh,

25
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.200
to enable us to do things and that same way that psychedelics

26
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.520
like many drugs could be used as tool, some more effective than others.

27
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.600
I don't think what you, I'm not sure what you can do effectively, um,

28
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.840
with alcohol. Uh, although somebody,

29
00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:54.080
I think somebody commented somewhere on social media that, uh,

30
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.700
I don't know why everyone gives is so negative about alcohol

31
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.210
because, um, I think the person said that, um,

32
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.500
it's given me some of the most incredible, it enabled me,

33
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.030
uh,

34
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.660
to let go and have some of the most incredible experiences with friends in my

35
00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:15.860
life. And it's true. We kind of sometimes say alcohol is dangerous.

36
00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:16.790
It can make you do hope.

37
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.110
But the reality is it's also a fascinating

38
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.850
tool for letting go of trying to be somebody

39
00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:30.080
maybe that you're not in allowing you to be yourself fully in whatever crazy

40
00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:34.670
form that is and allow you to have really deep and interesting experiences with

41
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.640
those you love. So, uh, yeah,

42
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.230
even alcohol can be used as an effective tool for exploring experiences and

43
00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:46.900
becoming, uh, expanding your mind and becoming a better person. So,

44
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.640
um, what the hell was I talking about? Uh, so yeah, so it's like,

45
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.120
so psychedelics and Oh, yeah. And, um, and, um, uh, MK ultra,

46
00:02:56.121 --> 00:03:00.280
is there something interesting to say in the, and are historical.

47
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.360
<v 2>Use of psychedelics?</v>

48
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.560
<v 1>I mean, think about it. When did we start doing that?</v>

49
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.850
When did we start using them?

50
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.820
<v 2>That's true. It's quite a long time ago. Right.</v>

51
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.920
<v 1>But okay. But true. But when did our government start experimenting with them?</v>

52
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.180
With us? Okay. All government is the United States government. Yeah. Okay.

53
00:03:18.181 --> 00:03:22.170
So that happened in around the 1950s. Okay.

54
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.210
After quote unquote, the 1940s where we have 47 and we have,

55
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.100
you know, this, you know, this Roswell type stuff going on. Okay.

56
00:03:32.101 --> 00:03:35.910
Like crash sites and things like that. So I think that, um,

57
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.070
I think there might be a correlation there. I don't know what it is. Okay.

58
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.600
<v 2>That's fascinating actually. Yeah. There's a lot of interesting things started.</v>

59
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.000
<v 1>Around that timeframe. Yeah.</v>

60
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.220
And so eldest Huxley would say we opened the doors of perception. Okay.

61
00:03:53.221 --> 00:03:54.150
And what flew in?

62
00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.340
<v 2>Um, man, that's beautifully put.</v>
