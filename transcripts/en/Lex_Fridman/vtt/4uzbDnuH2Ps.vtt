<v 0>This isn't like confidential stuff,</v>

2
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.850
but you sitting on a porch looking over the world,

3
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.130
looking at the work that Andre is doing any laws during the Tesla autopilot. Uh,

4
00:00:13.131 --> 00:00:15.620
do you like the trajectory of where things are going on?

5
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.540
They're making serious progress.

6
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.270
I like the videos of people driving the beta stuff.

7
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.080
Like it's taken some pretty complicated intersections and all that, but it's,

8
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.770
it's still an intervention for drive. I mean,

9
00:00:27.771 --> 00:00:31.190
I have Autopark the current autopilot, my, my Tesla, I use it every day.

10
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.330
Do you have full self driving beta or no? No. See you like where this is going.

11
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.560
We're making progress. It's taken longer than anybody thought. You know, my,

12
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.000
my wonder was is, you know, hardware three,

13
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.800
is it enough computing off by two, off by five by 10 off by a hundred.

14
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.180
Yeah. And I thought it probably wasn't enough,

15
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.730
but they're doing pretty well with it now.

16
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.280
And one thing is the dataset gets bigger. The training gets better.

17
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.600
And then there's this interesting thing is you sort of train and build an

18
00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:07.730
arbitrary. So he's not worked at solves the problem.

19
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.020
And then you refactor the network down to the thing that you can afford to ship.

20
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.910
Right? So the,

21
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.200
the goal isn't to build a network that fits in the phone it's to build

22
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.130
something that actually works. And then,

23
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.550
then how do you make that most effective on the hardware you have?

24
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.480
And they seem to be doing that much better than a couple of years ago.
