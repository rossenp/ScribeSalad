00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.710
<v 0>What do you think about Ernest Becker and, uh, those guys that put,</v>

2
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.190
put death at the, what is it? The warm at the core, which, uh,

3
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.790
as the main thing, the main,

4
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.190
like this confrontation of our own mortality, first of all,

5
00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:24.340
being understandable, I mortal and then confront the terror of it.

6
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.220
<v 2>The, the fear of it as the creative,</v>

7
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.460
like trying to escape the fear of death as the creative force

8
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.220
of human society.

9
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.260
So like the reason we do anything is because we're just running away from our

10
00:00:38.261 --> 00:00:40.940
death scared. Hmm. Uh,

11
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.970
do you find some of that to be true? First of all, as a,

12
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.850
somebody who looks in the mirror looks at yourself and your own as a human being

13
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:50.520
two,

14
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.330
just looking at society today and three at this whole big spread

15
00:00:55.331 --> 00:00:57.930
of human history and all the cool stuff we've created,

16
00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.930
including the mysteries of eucs.

17
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.320
<v 1>I wonder what life would look like in the absence of the fear of our mortality.</v>

18
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.520
I wonder how we'd interact with one another.

19
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.960
If there was relatively little or no fear of death, I,

20
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.920
I really do when it comes to Becker's work and others, um,

21
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.440
if the ancients were known for anything, it was running to death,

22
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.200
it was the opposite. In fact, dying before dying, which is the imortality key,

23
00:01:24.201 --> 00:01:27.270
by the way, it's not psychedelics point. When I, when I refer to this key,

24
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.270
I'm referring to this notion that's preserved in Greek, on Bethany.

25
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.830
If you die before you die, you won't die.

26
00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:39.990
<v 2>When you die. For some reason,</v>

27
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.910
the ancients prized that experience. And we talked about the,

28
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.340
of, of sophism and COism and Christian mysticism, where you have this,

29
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.460
the same self nodding, this death before death, the divine nothingness, right?

30
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.220
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; for some reason, the mystic saints,

31
00:01:57.221 --> 00:01:59.980
visionaries and ancient philosophers, they ran to death.

32
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.220
And the one message I wanted to try and communicate with this book is how they

33
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.890
viewed, um, that it can only be fully experienced,

34
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.490
fully embodied in the wake of a really intense,

35
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.530
perhaps terrifying, but utterly transformational encounter with death.

36
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.570
<v 0>So running to death, not running away from death.</v>
