1
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.870
<v 0>So let's, let's take somebody as an example. Let's take, uh,</v>

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.830
our mutual friend Vladimir Putin. Yes. Okay.

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.610
I don't know why he's saying his name makes my voice crack.

4
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.910
<v 1>Cause you scared he could hear you beetle juice Elijah.</v>

5
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.000
<v 0>So there's a lot of people that Steve, the one who built, you.</v>

6
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.220
<v 1>Know.</v>

7
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.600
<v 0>That was a, that was a collaboration. Um, what's,</v>

8
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.380
it's a double blind engineering effort

9
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.110
where I was not told of who my maker was.

10
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.130
There's a backstory, but um, there's a talking cricket,

11
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.000
you the real voice.

12
00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.320
I talk about him quite a bit because I find him fascinating.

13
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.210
Now there's a, there's a really important line that people say like,

14
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.070
why does Lex admire Putin? I do not admire Putin.

15
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.940
I find the man fascinating. I find Hitler. Fascinating.

16
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.060
I find a lot of figures in history. Fascinating,

17
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.820
both good and bad.

18
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.700
And the figures just as you said,

19
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.080
that are with us today, like vitamin or Putin, like Donald Trump,

20
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.730
like Barack Obama is difficult to play some on the spectrum of good and evil

21
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.140
because that's the only really applies to like when you see the consequences of

22
00:01:36.141 --> 00:01:38.000
their actions, there's no historical context.

23
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.950
So there's some people who say that Vladimir Putin is evil.

24
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.260
And based on our discussion about Hitler,

25
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.040
that's something I think about a lot, which is in the room with Putin.

26
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.530
And there's also a lot of historical descriptions of what it's like to be

27
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.280
in the room with Hitler in the 1930s. There,

28
00:02:00.281 --> 00:02:04.640
there is a lot of charisma in the same way. I find Putin to be,

29
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.610
uh, very charismatic in his own way. The humor, the wit the brilliance,

30
00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:12.140
the there's, um,

31
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.510
there's a simplicity of the way he thinks

32
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.620
that really if taken at face value

33
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.730
looks like a very intelligent, honest man

34
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.970
thinking practically about how to build a better Russia

35
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.410
constantly, almost like, um, that can executive,

36
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.220
like he loves, he,

37
00:02:39.221 --> 00:02:44.180
he looks like a man who loves his job in a way that Trump, for example,

38
00:02:44.181 --> 00:02:49.010
doesn't right. Meaning like he loves laws and rules and how to,

39
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.520
uh, no adversarial press. So that's going to help we, yes.

40
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.100
And he's popular with his people. That's also going to help northwesterly.

41
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.070
I'm talking about strictly the man,

42
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.890
the words coming out of his mouth, like all the videos and interviews I watched,

43
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.890
um, based on that, not the press, not the reporting.

44
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.020
You can just see that here's a man who's able to display

45
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.730
a charisma. That's not like I can see. That's why I love Joe Rogan.

46
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.520
That is like, you could tell the guy is genuine and there's a good person.

47
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.300
And I, you could tell immediately that like once you meet Joe,

48
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:27.520
that he's going to be offline also good person.

49
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.480
You could tell there's like signals that we send that are like difficult to kind

50
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:35.290
of describe in the same way you can tell Putin is

51
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.813
like,

52
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.140
he genuinely loves his job and wants to build a better Russia.

53
00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:45.880
There's the argument that he is action, evil man,

54
00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:50.290
behind that charisma, or is able to, you know,

55
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.030
assassinate people of no limit, free press,

56
00:03:55.031 --> 00:03:58.600
all those kinds of things. Like that's

57
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.990
what do we do with that?

58
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.400
So what do human beings like journalists,

59
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.070
or what do other leaders,

60
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.370
when they're in the room with Putin do with those kinds of notions

61
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.190
in deciding how to act in this world and deciding what policy to enact,

62
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.140
all those kinds of things. Just like with Hitler,

63
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.870
when a chairman is in the room with Hitler,

64
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.900
how does he decide how to act?

65
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.810
<v 2>Let's go back to like my real house, which is North Korea, right? So,</v>

66
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.430
uh, when your entire world is based on, uh,

67
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.670
being against Trump and everything Trump does is buffoonery or,

68
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:39.720
or kind of productive,

69
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.710
the conclusion of your reporting is going to be pretty much a given.

70
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.290
I was very hopeful that there would be some positive outlooks or outcomes

71
00:04:49.291 --> 00:04:52.710
rather of Trump's meeting with Kim Jong-un. Um,

72
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.340
it looked like there was a space for things to go a bit better.

73
00:04:56.341 --> 00:05:00.600
I talked about a lot at the time. Um, and

74
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.930
Trump was under no illusions about who he was dealing with.

75
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.310
Um, people pretend that, Oh, he was kind of naive.

76
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.340
He had one of the refugees that state stayed the union, you know,

77
00:05:14.341 --> 00:05:16.170
lifting up his crutch. Uh,

78
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.370
the first thing he sat down and talked to Jean ping about in Mar-a-Lago right

79
00:05:20.371 --> 00:05:22.350
after he became inaugurated was North Korea.

80
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.940
Barack Obama said that when he sat down Trump in the white house during the

81
00:05:26.941 --> 00:05:29.760
transfer of power, he said, North Korea is the biggest issue.

82
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.830
So I think a good leader, whether or not you consider Trump,

83
00:05:34.831 --> 00:05:37.620
a good leader has to be aware of all right,

84
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.060
I'm going to have to have relationships of some kind,

85
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.370
even if it's adversarial with some really evil, evil,

86
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.790
horrible people, which Kim juggling clearly is.

87
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:51.803
<v 0>Well,</v>

88
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.800
I don't think there's anybody that has a perspective that Norco North Korean,

89
00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.430
Kim Jong-un on or ill.

90
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.160
<v 2>Are not evil. Right? Correct.</v>

91
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.010
But with in 1930s, Germany,

92
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:11.240
isn't it a little bit more nuanced because Hitler hasn't done anything yet and

93
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:14.030
he's just a blowhard and he's an anti-Semite shore,

94
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.720
but he's what about like before the war breaks out?

95
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.560
Like what about the basic, uh,

96
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.250
actionable anti-Semitism when you're like just attacking,

97
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.150
hurting crystal enough? We'll talk about overnight a long knives, uh,

98
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.990
Kristallnacht night of the broken glass and the long nights is when he

99
00:06:32.991 --> 00:06:36.260
assassinated a bunch of his people. That was something different. Yeah.

100
00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:41.090
So like when you're actually attacking your own citizenry yeah.

101
00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:45.890
That was universally condemned Kristallnacht. And that was very shocking.

102
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.740
Uh, it's its level of barbarism, um, uh, to the West, because I think,

103
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.450
I think we still want to believe understandably

104
00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.080
that things aren't as bad as they seem.

105
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.500
We would rather, this is why I, you know, I,

106
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.730
the North Korea book I did dear reader is used in a humorous

107
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.710
framework because if you have to look, it's like looking to the sun,

108
00:07:12.711 --> 00:07:14.390
if you stare at it straight on,

109
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:18.380
it's very hard to do so you have to kind of look at it obliquely. And,

110
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.670
and then it kind of realizing the enormity of the depravity.

111
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:24.673
Um, and again,

112
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.870
pogroms in Russia had been a thing for a very long time and there is a

113
00:07:29.871 --> 00:07:32.330
difference between, okay, you know,

114
00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:35.630
we're going to sack these villages and persecute people and we're going to

115
00:07:35.631 --> 00:07:38.510
systematically exterminate them. That's th there's,

116
00:07:38.511 --> 00:07:41.210
there's still levels of evil and depravity.
