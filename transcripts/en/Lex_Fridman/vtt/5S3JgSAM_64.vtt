1
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.600
<v 0>I gotten the chance to interact with, uh, uh,</v>

2
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.560
this Matthew Johnson from Johnson Hopkins.

3
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.360
He's doing this large scale study of psychedelics it's,

4
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.520
it's becoming more and more.

5
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.360
I've gotten a chance to interact with that community of scientists working on

6
00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:20.320
psychedelics. But because of that, that opened the door to me, to all these, uh,

7
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.270
what do they call psychs? The people who, like you said, the 10% who, like,

8
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:26.590
I don't care.

9
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.310
<v 2>I don't know if there's a science behind this.</v>

10
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.110
I'm taking this spaceship to mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; if I'm be the first on Mars,

11
00:00:32.111 --> 00:00:34.310
I'll be, uh, the, you know, you know,

12
00:00:34.311 --> 00:00:39.070
psychedelics interesting in the sense that in another dimension, uh,

13
00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:43.900
like you said, it's a way to explore the, the limits of the human mind.

14
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.220
Like, what is this thing capable of doing?

15
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.900
Cause you kind of like when you dream, you detach it.

16
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.620
I don't know exactly in neuroscience of it,

17
00:00:51.621 --> 00:00:55.980
but you detach your like reality from

18
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.440
what your mind,

19
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.820
the images your mind is able to conjure up and your mind goes into weird places

20
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.610
and like entities appear somehow Freud and type of like,

21
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.730
trauma's probably connected in there somehow,

22
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.970
but you start to have like these weird vivid worlds.

23
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.490
<v 1>That like, so do you actively dream? Do you, do you, why not?</v>

24
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.690
I have like six, six hours of dreams and night. It's like real useful time. I.

25
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.480
<v 0>Know I don't, I haven't, uh, I, I don't for somebody, I just knock out and, uh,</v>

26
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.000
I have sometimes like anxiety inducing, kind of like very pragmatic,

27
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.160
like nightmare type of dreams. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but not nothing fun.

28
00:01:36.161 --> 00:01:39.960
Nothing, nothing fun, nothing fun. I, I try, I,

29
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.680
I unfortunately have mostly have fun. I, in, uh, the waking world,

30
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.790
which is very limited in the amount of money you can happen. &lt;laugh&gt;.

31
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.230
<v 1>It's not that limited either. Yeah. That's well, we'll have to talk &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

32
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.190
<v 0>Yeah, I need instructions. Uh.</v>

33
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.670
<v 1>Yeah. Well, there's like a manual for that. You might wanna &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

34
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.550
<v 0>I looked it up. I'll ask Elon. What, uh, what did you dream.</v>

35
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.540
<v 1>No years ago? And I, I read about, you know, like, you know,</v>

36
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.780
a book about how to have, you know, become aware in your dreams. I,

37
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.460
I worked on it for a while. Like, there's this trick about, you know,

38
00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:18.980
imagine you can see your hands and look out and, and I got somewhat good at it.

39
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.740
Like, but my, mostly when I'm thinking about things, working on problems,

40
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.610
I, I, I prep self before I go to sleep. It's like, I,

41
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.850
I pull into my mind all the things I wanna work on or think about.

42
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.850
And then that let's say greatly improves the chance is that I'll,

43
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.290
I'll work on that while I'm sleeping. And then, and then I also,

44
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.530
you know, basically ask to remember it

45
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.000
and I often remember very detailed within.

46
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.800
<v 0>The dream. Yeah. Or outside the dream.</v>

47
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.240
<v 1>Well, to bring it up in, in my dreaming. And then to remember it,</v>

48
00:02:57.241 --> 00:03:01.480
when I wake up, it's just, it's more of a meditative practice.

49
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.160
You say, you know, to prepare yourself to do that.

50
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.440
Like, if you go to, you know, the sleep still,

51
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.080
naing your teeth about some random thing that happened that you're not that

52
00:03:13.081 --> 00:03:17.560
really interested in. You'll dream about it. That's really interesting maybe,

53
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.710
but, but you direct your dreams somewhat by prepping.

54
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.670
<v 0>Yeah. I'm gonna have to try that. It's really interesting.</v>

55
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.870
Like the most important, the interesting, not like, uh, what,

56
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.550
what did this guy send an email kind of like stupid worry stuff,

57
00:03:32.551 --> 00:03:34.430
but like fundamental problems you're actually concerned.

58
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.710
<v 1>About. Yeah. Prepping and interesting things you're worried about are,</v>

59
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.310
or are books you're reading or, you know,

60
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.900
some great kind conversation you had or some, some adventure you wanna have,

61
00:03:41.901 --> 00:03:46.140
like, there's, there's a lot of space there. And,

62
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.060
and, and it seems to work that, you know,

63
00:03:51.061 --> 00:03:54.620
my percentage of interesting dreams and memories went up, I.
