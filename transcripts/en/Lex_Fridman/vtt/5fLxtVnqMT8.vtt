WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.370
<v 0>You mentioned that, um,</v>

2
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.330
a theory of everything may be quite difficult to come by a theory of everything

3
00:00:09.331 --> 00:00:12.690
broadly defined, meaning like truly a theory of everything. Yeah.

4
00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:14.970
But let's look at a more narrow theory of everything,

5
00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:19.610
which is that what the way it's used in often in physics is, uh,

6
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.960
a theory that unifies our, our current, uh,

7
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.760
laws of physics. Yeah. Uh, general relativity, uh, quantum field theory.

8
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.520
Do you have, uh, thoughts on this dream of a,

9
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.360
of a theory of everything in physics? How close are we?

10
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.720
Is there any promising ideas out there in your view?

11
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.790
<v 1>Well, it would be nice to have &lt;laugh&gt; it would be aesthetically pleasing,</v>

12
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.750
uh, will be useful. No, probably not. Well I'm, I shouldn't,

13
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.270
it's dangerous to say that, but, uh, probably not. I think we, uh, not,

14
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.870
not in, certainly not in the, uh, foreseeable future.

15
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.300
<v 0>Maybe to understand black holes.</v>

16
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.820
<v 1>Yeah. But that's, that's yes. Maybe to understand black holes,</v>

17
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.400
but that's not useful. &lt;laugh&gt; that my, and,

18
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.280
and, well, not only, I mean, only to understand it's, it's, it's worse,

19
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.030
you know,

20
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.760
it's not useful in the sense that we're not gonna be basing any technology

21
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.910
anytime soon on black holes, but it's, it's more severe than that.

22
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.830
I would say it's that the kinds of questions about black holes

23
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.150
that we can't answer within the framework of existing theory,

24
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.730
uh,

25
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.350
are ones that are not going to be susceptible to,

26
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.780
to astronomical observation in the foreseeable future.

27
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.460
There are questions about very, very small black holes when, uh,

28
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.460
when quantum effects come into play or, uh, uh,

29
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.380
so that black holes are, uh, you know, not, not black holes.

30
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.740
They're, they're, they're, they're emitting haw. Well,

31
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.410
this discovery of Hawking called Hawking radiation,

32
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.650
which for astronomical black holes is a tiny, tiny effect. That's no one ever,

33
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.490
no one has ever observed. It's a prediction.

34
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.610
<v 0>That's never been changed, like super massive black holes that doesn't apply.</v>

35
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.170
<v 1>No, no. The,</v>

36
00:02:20.171 --> 00:02:25.090
the predicted rate of radiation from those black holes is so

37
00:02:25.091 --> 00:02:29.000
tiny that it's absolute the UN observable and is overwhelmed by all kinds of

38
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:32.040
other effects. Uh, so, uh,

39
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.280
so it's not practical in the sense of technology.

40
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.000
It's not even practical in the sense of, uh, uh,

41
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.080
application to astronomy. The, the, we are existing theory of,

42
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.510
uh, general Relic and quantum theory.

43
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.470
And our theory of the,

44
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.870
the different fundamental forces is perfectly adequate to all pro all

45
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.110
problems of, uh,

46
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.800
technology for sure. Uh, and

47
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.200
almost all problems of astrophysics and

48
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.160
cosmology that appear except with the,

49
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.510
with the notable exception of the extremely early universe.

50
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.790
If you want to ask what happened before the big bang or what happened right.

51
00:03:23.791 --> 00:03:28.350
At the big bang, uh, which would be a great thing to understand, of course.

52
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.390
Uh, yes, we don't. But, uh, but.

53
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.070
<v 0>What about the engineering question? So if we look at, uh, space travel, so,</v>

54
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.500
uh, I, I think you've spoken with them, uh, Eric Weinstein. Oh yeah, really. Um,

55
00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.420
uh, you know, he says things like, we want to get off this planet.

56
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.980
His intuition is almost a motivator for the engineering project of

57
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.660
space exploration in order for us to crack this problem of becoming a multi

58
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.330
planetary species have to solve the physics problem. His intuition is like,

59
00:04:02.331 --> 00:04:06.610
if we figure out the, what he calls the source code, which is like,

60
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.010
like, like,

61
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.490
like a theory of everything might give us clues on how to start

62
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.330
hacking the fabric of reality, like getting.

63
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.240
<v 1>Shortcuts. Right. It might, I can't say that, you know, &lt;affirmative&gt;,</v>

64
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.960
I can't say that it won't,

65
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.720
but I can say that in the 1970s and early

66
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.873
1980s,

67
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.200
we achieved huge steps in

68
00:04:33.201 --> 00:04:37.320
understanding matter, uh, Q, C, D uh,

69
00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:39.680
much better understanding of the weak interaction,

70
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.310
much under better understanding of quantum mechanics in general.

71
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.950
And it's had minimal, uh, minimal impact on, on rocket.

72
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:49.950
<v 0>Design, on proport.</v>

73
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.990
<v 1>Certainly on rocket design, on anything, any technology whatsoever.</v>

74
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.630
And now we're talking about much more esoteric things.

75
00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.630
And since I don't know what they are,

76
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.780
I say for sure that they won't affect technology, but I'm very,

77
00:05:03.781 --> 00:05:08.220
very skeptical that they, they would affect technology. The, uh, uh,

78
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.540
the, because, you know, to access them,

79
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.220
you need to very exotic circumstances to make new kinds of particles with high

80
00:05:16.221 --> 00:05:18.340
energy. You need accelerators that are, you know,

81
00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.970
it's very expensive and you don't produce many, many of them. And so, you know,

82
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.810
it's just, uh, it's a pipe dream, I think yeah. About space exploration. Yes.

83
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.890
I'm not sure exactly what he has in mind. And, uh, but, uh, to me,

84
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.770
uh, it's more a problem of, of,

85
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.320
I don't something between biology and oh, yeah. And, and,

86
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.000
uh, maybe a little AI and, and information processing, what you mean,

87
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.893
how should I,

88
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.320
I think human bodies are not well adapted to space. Yeah.

89
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.160
Even Mars or even, you know, know,

90
00:05:57.161 --> 00:06:01.760
which is the closest thing to a kind of human environment that we're gonna find

91
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.720
anywhere close by, uh, very,

92
00:06:04.721 --> 00:06:08.480
very difficult to maintain humans on Mars, uh,

93
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.040
and gonna be, you know, very expensive and very, you know, very unstable.

94
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.350
And, but I think the pro how I ever, uh, if we

95
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.510
take a broader view of what it means

96
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.590
to bring human civilization

97
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.230
outside of the earth, if we're satisfied with, you know,

98
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.420
sending minds out there that we can converse with and actuators,

99
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.300
and that, that we can in, uh, uh,

100
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.780
manipulate and sensors that we can get feedback from. I think that's,

101
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.340
that's where it's at. &lt;laugh&gt; for sure. I think that's so much,

102
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.260
so much more realistic. And, uh,

103
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.330
and I think that that's the long term future of, uh,

104
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.930
space exploration. It's not holding human bodies all over the place and that's,

105
00:07:02.931 --> 00:07:05.690
that's, that's just silly. &lt;laugh&gt; well.

106
00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:09.370
<v 0>It's, it's possible that human bodies. Um, so like you said,</v>

107
00:07:09.371 --> 00:07:12.890
it's a biology problem what's possible is that, um,

108
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.730
we extend human lab Spann in some way. Just,

109
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.760
we have to look at a bigger picture. It could be just like you're saying,

110
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.600
by sending robots with actuators and kind of extending

111
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:31.040
the, the, our limbs, but it could also be extending some aspect of our minds,

112
00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.073
so information.

113
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.160
<v 1>And it could be cyborgs. It could be, uh, it could be now we're talking,</v>

114
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.550
&lt;laugh&gt; not, it could be, you know, it could, uh, it could be,

115
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:42.920
uh,

116
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:47.790
human brains or cells that realize something like human brain architecture,

117
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.870
uh, within, uh, uh,

118
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:56.630
within artificial environments, you know, shells, if you like that,

119
00:07:56.631 --> 00:08:01.460
that are more adapted to the conditions of space and, uh, that yeah,

120
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.220
so that that's entirely man machine hybrids,

121
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.140
as well as sort of remote, uh,

122
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.340
outposts that we can communicate with. I think, I think those,

123
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:13.940
those will happen. And, uh.

124
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:16.620
<v 0>Yeah, to me, there's some sense in which,</v>

125
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.290
as opposed to understanding the physics of, of, um,

126
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:26.490
the, the, the, the fundamental fabric of the universe,

127
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:30.610
I think getting to the physics of life, the physics of intelligence,

128
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:35.250
the physics of consciousness will the physics of information, uh,

129
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.850
that, that, uh, that brings, uh, from,

130
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.680
for mergers that will allow us to do space exploration.

131
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:47.960
<v 1>Yeah. I, well, I think physics in the larger sense has a lot to contribute here.</v>

132
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:53.080
Yeah. Not the physics of finding fundamental new laws in the sense of, uh,

133
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:59.040
you know, another qu or axons, even &lt;laugh&gt; the, the, uh, but,

134
00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:03.400
uh, uh, physics in the sense of, you know,

135
00:09:03.401 --> 00:09:08.400
physics has a lot of experience in analyzing complex situations

136
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.400
and analyzing new states of matter and devising new kinds of instruments that do

137
00:09:12.401 --> 00:09:14.870
clever things. We, you know, we, the,

138
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:19.630
the physics in that sense has enormous amounts to contribute to, uh,

139
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.150
this kind of endeavor.

140
00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:25.990
But I don't think that looking for a

141
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.550
so-called theory of any, everything has much to do with it at all.
