00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:05.830
<v 0>Uh, speaking of balance, that's complicated. I,</v>

2
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.110
I wonder because we're living through one of the more important moments in human

3
00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:11.710
history with this particular virus,

4
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.230
it seems like pandemics have at least the ability to, uh,

5
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.470
kill off most of the human population at their worst mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

6
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.900
And there there's just fascinating to, there's so many viruses in this world.

7
00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:28.540
<v 2>There's so many, I mean, viruses basically around the world in a sense that, uh,</v>

8
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.860
they've been around very long time. They're everywhere.

9
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.100
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; they seem to be extremely powerful in their dis in a

10
00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:37.140
distributed kind of way. But at the same time,

11
00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:39.340
they're not intelligent and they're not even living.

12
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.410
Do you have a like high level thoughts about this virus that, uh, uh,

13
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.290
like in terms of you being fascinated, terrified, or someone.

14
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.210
<v 1>Between, so I believe in frameworks, right?</v>

15
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.330
So like one of 'em is evolution Uhhuh, like we're evolved creatures,

16
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.810
right? Yes. And one of the things about evolution is it's hyper-competitive,

17
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.520
and it's not competitive out of a sense of evil it's of it,

18
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.680
a sense of there's endless variation and variations that work better when, and,

19
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.040
and then over time, there's so many levels of that competition, you know,

20
00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:18.760
like multicellular life pro partly exists because of, you know, the,

21
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.160
the, the competition between, you know, different kinds of life forms.

22
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.310
And we know sex partly exists as scramble our genes so that we have, you know,

23
00:01:27.311 --> 00:01:29.590
genetic ver variation against, uh,

24
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.190
the invasion of the bacteria and the viruses. And it's endless, like,

25
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.910
I've heard some funny statistic,

26
00:01:36.911 --> 00:01:40.190
like the density of viruses and bacteria in the ocean is really high.

27
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.230
And one third of the bacteria die every day because the viruses invaded them.

28
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.700
&lt;laugh&gt; one third of em. Wow. Like, like,

29
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.460
I don't know if that number is true, but it was like,

30
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.020
like there's like the amount of competition and what's going on is stunning.

31
00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.540
And there's a theory as we age, we slowly accumulate bacterias and viruses.

32
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.380
And as our immune system kind of goes down, you know,

33
00:02:04.381 --> 00:02:06.970
that's what slowly kills us. And it just.

34
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.490
<v 0>Feels so peaceful from a human perspective when we sit back and they're able to</v>

35
00:02:10.491 --> 00:02:14.530
have a relaxed conversation, uh, and, and there's wars.

36
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.610
<v 1>Going on out there. Yeah. Like right now, you're,</v>

37
00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:20.730
you're you harboring how many bacteria and, you know, the ones,

38
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.370
many of 'em are parasites on you.

39
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.560
And some of 'em are helpful and some of 'em are modifying your B behavior.

40
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.080
And some of them are, you know, it's just really, it's really wild,

41
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.360
but you know, this particular manifestation is unusual, you know,

42
00:02:35.361 --> 00:02:38.680
in the demographic, uh, how it hit and the political, you know,

43
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.920
response that it engendered and, you know, the healthcare response,

44
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.160
it engendered and the technology, it gendered, it's kind of wild. Yeah. The.

45
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.310
<v 0>Case on Twitter that it, it, uh, led every level,</v>

46
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.070
all that kind of stuff at every, every single level. Yeah. But, but.

47
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.510
<v 1>What usually kills life, the big extinctions are caused by, um,</v>

48
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.350
meteors and volcanoes.

49
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.520
<v 0>That's the one you're worried about as oppos to human created bombs that we.</v>

50
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.480
<v 1>Uh, solar, solar flares are another good one. You know,</v>

51
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.920
occasionally solar flares hit the planet.

52
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.293
<v 0>So it's nature.</v>

53
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.280
<v 1>It's yeah. It's all pretty wild.</v>
