00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.810
<v 0>Well, let's go. Let's talk about Moore's law a little bit. It's, uh, uh,</v>

2
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.650
at the broad view of Moore's law,

3
00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:15.180
where it's just exponential improvement of, uh, computing capability,

4
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.650
uh, like open AI, for example, recently published this kind of

5
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:21.811
papers,

6
00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:26.280
looking at the exponential improvement in a training efficiency of neural

7
00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:29.130
networks for like image net and all that kind of stuff,

8
00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:30.090
which has got better on the,

9
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.490
this is purely software side is figuring out better tricks and

10
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.810
algorithms for training neural networks. And that seems to be improving, uh,

11
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.050
significantly faster than the Moore's law prediction. You know?

12
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.450
So that's in the software space.

13
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.640
What do you think if Moore's law continues or if the

14
00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:53.100
general version of Moore's law continues,

15
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.580
do you think that comes mostly from the hardware, from the software,

16
00:00:56.581 --> 00:01:01.040
some mix of the two, some interesting, totally. Uh, so not,

17
00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:04.710
not the reduction of the size of the transistor kind of thing, but more in the,

18
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.330
uh, uh,

19
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.320
in the totally interesting kinds of innovations in the hardware space,

20
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:11.154
all that kind of stuff.

21
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.560
<v 1>Well, there's like half a dozen things going on in that graph.</v>

22
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.450
So one is there's initial innovations that had a lot of headroom to be

23
00:01:20.451 --> 00:01:22.910
exploited. So, you know,

24
00:01:22.911 --> 00:01:25.730
the efficiency of the networks is improved dramatically.

25
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.090
And then the D composability of those [inaudible], you know

26
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.090
, they started running on one computer, then multiple computers and multiple 

27
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.090
GPU's and NRAS the GPU's

28
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.090
 and they're up to thousands. And at some point, so, so it's sort of like there

29
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.090
 were consumed, they were going from like a single computer application to a thousand computer application. So that's not really a Moore's law thing. 

30
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.090
That's an independent vector. How many computers can I put on this problem? 

31
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.090
Because the computers themselves are getting better on like a Moore's law. Right

32
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.090
. But their ability to go from one to 10 to 100

33
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.090
 to a thousand, you know, it was something and then multiplied by the amount of 

34
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.090
computes it took to resolve like Alex net to resonate

35
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.923
 to transformers. It's, it's been quite, you know, steady improvements.

36
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.120
<v 0>Those are like cars aren't, they, that's the,</v>

37
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.030
exactly the kind of cars that are underlying Moore's law from the very

38
00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:21.770
beginning. So, so what, what's the biggest, what's the most, uh,

39
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.510
productive, uh, rich source of S-curves in the future?

40
00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:28.850
Do you think, is it hardware? Is it software?

41
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.320
<v 1>So hardware is going to move along relatively slowly,</v>

42
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.240
like, you know, double performance every two years. There's still,

43
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.420
I like how you call that slowly. It's the slow version,

44
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.750
the snail's pace of Moore's law. Maybe we should, we should,

45
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.840
we should trademark that one.

46
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.600
Whereas the scaling by number of computers, you know, can go much faster,

47
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.780
you know, I'm sure at some point Google had a, you know,

48
00:02:56.781 --> 00:03:00.490
their initial search engine was running out a laptop, you know, like, yeah.

49
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.060
And then at some point they really worked on scaling out and then they factor

50
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.900
the, the indexer from, you know, this piece and this piece and this piece,

51
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:10.690
and they spread the data and more and more things. And, you know,

52
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:12.730
they did a dozen innovations,

53
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.630
but as they scaled up the number of computers on that, it kept breaking,

54
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.840
finding new bottlenecks in their software and their schedulers and,

55
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.450
and made a rethink. Like,

56
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.560
it seems insane to do a scheduler across a thousand computers who scheduled

57
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:29.200
parts of it and then send the results to the one computer.

58
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.030
But if you want to schedule a million searches, that makes perfect sense. So,

59
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.800
so there's th the scaling by just quantity is probably the richest thing.

60
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.400
But then as you scale quantity,

61
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.480
like a network that was great on a hundred computers may a completely the wrong

62
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:47.020
one.

63
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.820
You may pick a network that's 10 times slower on 10,000 computers like per

64
00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:55.780
computer. But if you go from a hundred to 10,000, that's a hundred times.

65
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.110
So that's one of the things that happened when we did internet scaling.

66
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.980
This efficiency went down, not up.

67
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.860
The future of computing is inefficiency, not efficiency,

68
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.750
but scales and efficient scale.

69
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.500
It's scaling faster than efficiency bite you.

70
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.850
And as long as there's a dollar value there, like scaling costs, lots of money,

71
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.170
but Google showed Facebook showed everybody showed that the scale was where the

72
00:04:20.171 --> 00:04:20.800
money was at.
