00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.120
<v 0>Why do you think I, Rand is such a controversial figure.</v>

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.800
Last time I spoke with you on this particular podcast, the,

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.760
the amount of emails I've gotten,

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.880
&lt;laugh&gt; a positive and negative and certainly negative.

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.760
I don't usually get negative emails. Yeah, but you, yeah, I can't,

6
00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:22.720
I can't relate. What's I'm sure mine were positive, overwhelmingly positive. Uh,

7
00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:25.630
it was mostly, uh, women sending pictures, uh,

8
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.550
for me to forward to you because you didn't send me anything. &lt;laugh&gt; I can I,

9
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.390
oh, it's the wrong email address. &lt;laugh&gt; sorry. I kept bouncing.

10
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.870
I send you to your, so this is love. &lt;laugh&gt; uh,

11
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.150
love hurts. Okay. Yeah, no I, but why do you think she's such a divisive figure?

12
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.300
Why do you think that she provokes such emotion in both the positive and the

13
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.020
negative side? I'd love to hear both of your viewpoints.

14
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.020
<v 1>On this. Well, I think on the negative side,</v>

15
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.940
in both on the positive and the negative side,

16
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.940
I think it's because she's radical, she's consistently radical.

17
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.420
She upends the, the, uh, premises,

18
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.170
the ideas that are prevalent in the culture that we're brought up on that, that,

19
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.610
that are like, you know, uh, they're like milk and, and, uh, and, and,

20
00:01:12.611 --> 00:01:15.010
you know, the basic stuff that we're, we're growing up,

21
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.010
you have to be altruistic. You have to live other people.

22
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.410
That's just basic stuff. Nobody challenges that nobody questions it.

23
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.770
And if they do question it,

24
00:01:21.771 --> 00:01:26.720
they usually question it from the perspective of a or a, a bad guy.

25
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.400
Right. You mentioned the, the joker right before we started. Right. You know,

26
00:01:30.401 --> 00:01:33.880
I'm gonna upend the world because I don't care about other people. Right. So,

27
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.920
so they're presented with these two alternatives and it's real in people's

28
00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:37.754
lives. Right?

29
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.120
You either live other people or you are evil sob. Um,

30
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.870
and you know, yeah. Most people, either one of those,

31
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.910
but the ethic is right here. It's, it's living for other people.

32
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.430
And when you challenge that, they have no way cognitive to go with that.

33
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.510
And the only place they can go with that cognitively is to the joker it's to the

34
00:01:57.511 --> 00:02:00.310
evil guy. It's to somebody who wants to smash everything and destroy,

35
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.950
because they don't have this alternate conception of, oh, no,

36
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.700
you can be rational only self-interested. And that does not involve destruction.

37
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.420
And that does not involve E you know, the, uh, exploiting other people.

38
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.620
They can't conceptualize that it's not in their framework. Um,

39
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.020
so it's the fact that she's so consistently on the side of self-interest,

40
00:02:22.021 --> 00:02:26.060
for example, on the side of capitalism, on the side of freedom, uh, it's the,

41
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.330
a fact that she dismisses faith to the extent that she does, or,

42
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.690
or to the extent that I do, right. That aliens people,

43
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.210
cuz that is completely different from what they brought up.

44
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.050
Now the flip side of that is it's also really interesting to some people.

45
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.970
So, you know, a lot of you got some positives, right? Um,

46
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.040
and I got a lot of positives in their appearance.

47
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.920
I know a lot of people came to my podcast because I appeared on your show. Why?

48
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.720
Because they hear something that's completely fresh, new, different.

49
00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.600
They've never heard before it appeals to something in them that maybe, you know,

50
00:03:00.601 --> 00:03:03.080
a lot of people say I read Iran and it confirmed everything.

51
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.760
I believed now for me, it didn't, it was the opposite.

52
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.160
It turned upside down everything I believe same here,

53
00:03:08.161 --> 00:03:11.360
but there are a lot of people out there that who have a sense that something's

54
00:03:11.361 --> 00:03:14.280
wrong in the world. That altruism is wrong. That socialism,

55
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.800
that just the stuff and, and religion is wrong,

56
00:03:16.801 --> 00:03:18.440
but they don't have an alternative. It has.

57
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.990
And they listen to a lot of podcasts cuz they're trying to get ideas of what is

58
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:25.630
it, what is it that I'm sensing that's wrong out there.

59
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.310
And suddenly somebody comes out and gives them some clear explanation of things

60
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.510
and they go, wow, that's what I've been looking for my whole life.

61
00:03:33.511 --> 00:03:37.750
So that's the positive for, for people. Um, you know, and I at IAnd,

62
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.140
it just all made sense. It all clicked and all in,

63
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.100
in E and it made clear that everything I believed to that point was just wrong.

64
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.540
It just didn't, it didn't integrate.

65
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.660
And I always knew to some extent it didn't integrate,

66
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.860
but there was no alternatives. I believed it. What, what else was there? I,

67
00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.370
I remember saying to myself as a kid, probably 15, why should I, why is this,

68
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.050
why is morality all about other people? Why is that? Well,

69
00:04:04.051 --> 00:04:06.450
that's just the way it is. Right. And, and I, and I couldn't,

70
00:04:06.451 --> 00:04:07.530
couldn't come up with an explanation.

71
00:04:07.531 --> 00:04:09.810
She gave me the explanation and she gave me the explanation,

72
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.050
why it's wrong to do that. And I think so. I think that's why people respond.

73
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.490
It's just too radical.

74
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.970
It can't fit into their cognitive framework that they're being brought up.

75
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.360
That they've been educated on that that just the whole life evolves.

76
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.120
<v 0>Around. Luckily you don't bring up.</v>

77
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.520
I Rand that much in conversation except as kind of references every once in a

78
00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:29.620
while,

79
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.320
as part of the humor of just the general flow and the music of the way you like

80
00:04:33.321 --> 00:04:34.600
to talk. Well,

81
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.680
why do you think you don't integrate her into your philosophy when

82
00:04:39.681 --> 00:04:42.430
you're like it's explaining ideas and all those kinds of things?

83
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.590
Like why is she not, you know,

84
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.190
a popular reference point for discussion of ideas?

85
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.990
<v 2>Because I, I, and I don't,</v>

86
00:04:50.991 --> 00:04:53.470
I don't know if everyone's gonna agree with or can't agree with me.

87
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.870
I think for a certain percentage of population,

88
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.710
actually I talked to someone from the Ironman Institute. I forgot his name,

89
00:04:58.711 --> 00:05:01.420
older guy with glasses and he didn't disagree with me. He said,

90
00:05:01.421 --> 00:05:02.340
this is changing. I said,

91
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.620
I think for a certain percentage of population who are uninformed about her work

92
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.580
higher than 10%, less than 50% you mention, I Rand,

93
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.300
they have been trained to think this is identical Scientology.

94
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.860
So as soon as her name comes up, it's like, okay, I'm out the door. I don't,

95
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.700
I'm not gonna have anything to do with this.

96
00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:21.420
And everyone who follows her is a crazy person. That's one thing that I,

97
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.570
another thing is Rand in her, um,

98
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.090
personality was very aggressive and antagonistic.

99
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.090
She was for a long time, the lone voice and the wilderness being like this.

100
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.730
Isn't like, uh, you know,

101
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.850
like one of her big adversaries in a certain sense was Milton Friedman.

102
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.480
And she really hated Hal Milton Fridman was like, you know,

103
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.400
having rent control is inefficient and she's like inefficient,

104
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.280
we're talking about mass homelessness and people dying.

105
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.120
And you're talking about this, like what color tie goes with this color shirt?

106
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.160
Are you in? Like, and in fact, it's hilarious. Uh,

107
00:05:58.161 --> 00:06:00.880
there was an organization called the foundation for economic education fee.

108
00:06:00.881 --> 00:06:05.680
Leonard Reed was the head of this and there were a series of letters

109
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.680
and she was helping him. She was much more philosoph,

110
00:06:08.681 --> 00:06:12.080
grounded in certain context than he was. And there was an essay, uh,

111
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.950
pamphlet that he published called roofs or ceilings. It was co by,

112
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:18.303
uh, Milton Friedman,

113
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.710
late later Nobel prize winner and George Stigler also later Nobel prize winner.

114
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.590
Yeah. And basically the argument was, well,

115
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:26.990
if the government controls all housing,

116
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.990
how's that gonna work out and she's sitting there and she's typing in all caps.

117
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.230
So, you know, she's holding on the shift team at.

118
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.063
<v 1>Doing this.</v>

119
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.180
<v 2>On a type plate on a typewriter and, and being like how,</v>

120
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.500
and you can imagine her with her cigarette holder apoplectic being like,

121
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.580
how is an organization ostensibly,

122
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.900
devoted to free enterprise discussing these,

123
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.700
this Stalinist idea in the most casual of terms. She's like,

124
00:06:54.701 --> 00:06:55.461
have I taught you not?

125
00:06:55.461 --> 00:07:00.010
And what's amazing is so I at fee they only have her letters

126
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.850
because she sent them to read the Iran Institute must have Leonard read letter

127
00:07:03.851 --> 00:07:06.690
letters. Oh, we do. Yeah. I was able to knowing, ran enough,

128
00:07:06.691 --> 00:07:09.490
predict exactly what the conversation would go like,

129
00:07:09.491 --> 00:07:11.850
because he also did something she didn't approve of,

130
00:07:11.851 --> 00:07:15.890
which is he asked other people for, uh, feedback on her work. And she goes,

131
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.360
I gave this to you to read, were you shopping around for some jerk that I don't,

132
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.680
I need their approval. What are you doing? So it was a very, uh,

133
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.960
interesting situation. But so that's one issue. I, oh.

134
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.800
<v 1>Remember this is, I end when she's young, she was not young. So well,</v>

135
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.200
relatively young. Right. It's it's before as sharp, it was before I,

136
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.520
so it's before she's super famous.

137
00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.470
And before this is the fan HEADSS been published, but you know,

138
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.080
she's,

139
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.950
she's trying to work with others and they're disappointing her left

140
00:07:44.951 --> 00:07:45.380
and right.

141
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.750
<v 2>Yeah. So, and also when you are a,</v>

142
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.590
what she takes away from bad people is you have these kids,

143
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.350
right. And you're gonna sit down with them and they're gonna be like, yeah,

144
00:07:57.351 --> 00:08:01.020
I'm gonna take your guns. I'm gonna lock you in your house. Um,

145
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.180
I'm gonna take 60% of your income and all this other stuff.

146
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.980
And they might up to reading, ran. They might sit down and have a discussion.

147
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.980
And Rand goes, Hey, you know what? You don't even have to give them an answer.

148
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.740
You could say, go to hell. We're not having this conversation.

149
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.730
And you have no right to one second of my life.

150
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.410
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and this is not a legitimate opener.

151
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.810
This is a declaration of war. This isn't like,

152
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.210
it's not like if I sit down with you Iran, I'm like, Hey, Ron,

153
00:08:28.211 --> 00:08:30.650
here are my plans for your wife. &lt;laugh&gt; go to hell. Yeah.

154
00:08:30.651 --> 00:08:32.330
This isn't a conversation we're having, oh,

155
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.130
I'm gonna make you unsafe in your house. What? This is not a discussion.

156
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:39.690
So what happens is these people who five minutes ago were able to have a debate

157
00:08:39.691 --> 00:08:42.080
with kid, cuz people read random when they're young, often.

158
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.160
And now that kid is like, yeah, I'm not even talking to you. It's her fault.

159
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:51.080
Whereas in reality, it's that person's fault because that person had no right.

160
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.800
Although they've been trained to the contrary by our culture to believe, yeah,

161
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:59.000
I'm gonna sit down and we're just gonna equally have a discussion of your own's

162
00:08:59.001 --> 00:09:01.360
life and you have one vote and I have one vote and we're gonna,

163
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.840
and no L has a vote and that's,

164
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.080
that's how it's gonna be flat and Rand's not having it. Yeah. Um,

165
00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.160
so I think those are two issues and, and there's some other things which,

166
00:09:09.161 --> 00:09:10.440
which I don't need to get into,

167
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:15.430
but I IC one of the things that Rand said consisting her life is

168
00:09:15.431 --> 00:09:17.990
that her philosophy is an integrated whole, right.

169
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.830
So to be an objective is isn't just like, I like Atlas shrug.

170
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:26.430
It means I accept objective as a totality, since I do not.

171
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:27.311
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I don't,

172
00:09:27.311 --> 00:09:32.070
I think it is proper to be respectful to her wishes and not constantly be,

173
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:34.750
especially given that I have somewhat of a platform to be like iron ran Ironman

174
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:37.940
and ran because I don't think iron Rand would've liked it.

175
00:09:37.941 --> 00:09:39.220
If I was talking about Iran this much.

176
00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.020
<v 0>So how do you, how do you deprogram? Cause I,</v>

177
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.980
I don't like to bring up iron Rand just because I do see what, uh,

178
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.420
like how people roll their eyes essentially. So how do it's the upside?

179
00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.140
You know what, what's the upside exactly. But what is that pro? Can we,

180
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.220
can you speak to that programming? I.

181
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.570
<v 1>Think people have I'm programming people. I mean, look at the end of the day,</v>

182
00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.970
if you talk about the ideas and ideas, make sense,

183
00:10:00.971 --> 00:10:03.610
and people attracted to the ideas and you say, oh, by the way,

184
00:10:03.611 --> 00:10:06.890
and this came from mind, ran. That's how you deprogrammed them. Right.

185
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:08.890
If you make the ideas prevalent in the culture,

186
00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:12.050
if people start viewing self-interest as something that's kind,

187
00:10:12.051 --> 00:10:15.530
that's interesting and worthwhile in something with investigating.

188
00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.720
And they said, oh, that came from Ironman. Then I think,

189
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.640
I think that then we'll,

190
00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.400
we'll deprogram them and get them and get them changing their minds about these

191
00:10:24.401 --> 00:10:27.760
things. And also, you know, going on shows where, uh,

192
00:10:27.761 --> 00:10:30.960
people are gonna watch your show no matter who you bring on. Right. So, uh,

193
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.800
even though now you do, if you put iron,

194
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.070
you put Ironman in the title that me immediately reduces the number of people

195
00:10:38.071 --> 00:10:40.350
who watch. So, so in the future, you should.

196
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:44.150
<v 0>You put Michael mouse in the title and then at least the female population too.</v>

197
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.670
<v 1>Exactly. The female to, yeah, absolutely. Just to say that's right. But so,</v>

198
00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:49.910
so you go and you try to make them as credible,

199
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.190
as possible to as many people as possible over time, it takes time.

200
00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.550
And ultimately, I don't think the culture will have this response to her.

201
00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.100
They might still disagree with her,

202
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.060
but I think over time and already you're seeing it, younger people,

203
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:05.100
I think today are far less, there was a generation who never read iron,

204
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.300
ran and was like this being out the Golic and the crosses.

205
00:11:08.301 --> 00:11:10.380
We don't wanna have anything to do with her then. And,

206
00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.900
and I think today there are many more people who read her and might disagree or

207
00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.980
not disagree. Right. And then there were a lot of people who haven't read her,

208
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.530
but who not, not opposed or willing to have an, to engage.

209
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.530
So I think it's changing already. And I think in 20 years it'll be.

210
00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:24.170
<v 2>Completely different.</v>

211
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:26.850
And just two more things that she does that I think says that I think people

212
00:11:26.851 --> 00:11:30.970
find very, very off putting, given our culture. One is she will basically,

213
00:11:30.971 --> 00:11:32.610
you could sit down with Rand and be like,

214
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:37.770
your fear is not in any way a hold on my freedom. Just that one sentence.

215
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:42.480
And for a lot of people that's very off putting, uh, and very harsh.

216
00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.880
It's correct. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but for them, it's just like, wait a minute.

217
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.240
I I'm still scared. It's I don't care. Like, for example,

218
00:11:49.241 --> 00:11:51.600
like with lockdowns and things like this. Yeah. It's like, well,

219
00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.000
I'm scared and maybe I have a right to be scared. Ah gotcha. Or like,

220
00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:58.400
I'm scared that you have a gun in your house and it's like, I respect that.

221
00:11:58.401 --> 00:12:00.840
You're scared. I don't care at the end. At the, as you say,

222
00:12:00.841 --> 00:12:04.520
at the end of the day, this is my house. I'm going to live my life as I please,

223
00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:07.200
as long as I don't hurt other people, well, you are hurting me cuz I'm scared.

224
00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.000
No, that that's not, this is.

225
00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:09.853
<v 1>The feeling versus.</v>

226
00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.440
<v 2>Fact. Yeah. Yeah. So that is one, uh, situation.</v>

227
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:17.750
Just like a feeling versus freedom essentially where ran is that puts a lot of

228
00:12:17.751 --> 00:12:22.350
people off. Um, I also think that historically,

229
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:26.070
a lot of people who were drawn to her are drawn to her for the wrong reasons.

230
00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.350
That a lot of times like Howard Rourke, uh, the,

231
00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:32.150
the hero we're gonna still stay hero.

232
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:33.820
Are you supposed to say protagonist spa hero? Yeah.

233
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.100
The hero of the fountain head, he's extremely intelligent,

234
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.500
but he's also extremely uncompromising.

235
00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:43.380
What often ends up happening is you'll have a young kid who is somewhat

236
00:12:43.381 --> 00:12:44.200
intelligent,

237
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.460
but then they pick up the personality and now you're someone I can't work with.

238
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.860
And then it's like, you're not Howard RO relax. You're not that skilled.

239
00:12:50.861 --> 00:12:51.694
You're not that talented,

240
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:55.850
but because the character has to notification and have certain aspects together,

241
00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:56.840
the,

242
00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.490
when kids read that they're gonna might get the wrong idea and that's not rans

243
00:12:59.570 --> 00:12:59.970
fault. And, and.

244
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:03.930
<v 1>It's more than that. It's it's so, so I,</v>

245
00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:06.850
I can really agree with that, but it's, it's even broader than that. So,

246
00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.490
so here is a, in my view, you know,

247
00:13:09.491 --> 00:13:13.570
one of the geniuses of the millennium presenting a philosophy and she's got not

248
00:13:13.571 --> 00:13:14.720
just a question in my view,

249
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.480
she's got the answers and you're reading them at 16 and you're reading the

250
00:13:17.481 --> 00:13:22.320
answers. You don't know at 16, that this is true. Yeah. Yeah.

251
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.080
You might have a sense that it's true, but you don't have the life experience,

252
00:13:25.081 --> 00:13:28.120
the learned experience. You don't have the fact, you don't have the knowledge,

253
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:32.760
you're picking up truth. It's just being absorbed. You're accepting. It is true,

254
00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:33.920
but you don't know it's true.

255
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:38.270
And then you go out into the world advocating for it. Right. Which we all did.

256
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.830
Or at least I did when I was 16 and you're obnoxious.

257
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:44.470
You can't prove what you're arguing for. Yeah. Yeah.

258
00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.270
Because you don't have the experience. It took me, I don't know, 10, 20 years,

259
00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:52.910
probably 20 to figure out that I really do think she, what she said was true.

260
00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.980
Right. But I didn't know when I was 16, when I was 16,

261
00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:01.260
I just absorbed these ideas and accepted them in a sense, you know,

262
00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:04.580
with some connection to reality, but in a sense on faith, right.

263
00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.860
At least presented it that way. Um, and you, and, and,

264
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:13.580
and as a consequence, you come off as a detached from reality, obnoxious, uh,

265
00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.650
human being, I think a lot of young objectives are,

266
00:14:16.651 --> 00:14:19.050
and it's hard not to be because you are,

267
00:14:19.051 --> 00:14:21.450
you're confronted with genius and you're not a genius.

268
00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:22.443
I certainly am not a genius.

269
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:26.290
And I'm confronted with just genius and have all this information in my head.

270
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:31.290
Now I can't articulate it. And, and, and I, and it's hard to deal with yourself.

271
00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:32.170
What, there's an inside.

272
00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:34.850
<v 2>Joke. No, you said confront a genius that point to us. Yeah. I mean.</v>

273
00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.240
<v 1>I'm confronted with you guys. I'm,</v>

274
00:14:37.241 --> 00:14:39.800
I'm at an age where I know how to deal with geniuses. Um.

275
00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.320
<v 2>But I'm gonna, there's something else. This is not why people don't like her,</v>

276
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.240
but there's something that the fountain head does, which I think is very, uh,

277
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.800
um, and I don't, I don't blame her, but it's, it's a bad consequence.

278
00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.480
If you read the fountain fountain head and you're young and you're intelligent

279
00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.840
and talented, the message at least I got,

280
00:14:54.841 --> 00:14:58.240
and I know I'm not alone is you are going to think that you're gonna be a

281
00:14:58.241 --> 00:15:01.760
pariah, that, uh, a lot of people are gonna be against you. And you're gonna,

282
00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:05.920
you're basically doomed for a short period, right. Of being isolated and alone.

283
00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:08.480
And that may have been the case when the fountain head was written.

284
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.430
But I think now with the internet and in my experience,

285
00:15:11.431 --> 00:15:15.310
both as a youth and someone who's a little bit older, I didn't appreciate,

286
00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.550
and you're not gonna get it from that book.

287
00:15:16.551 --> 00:15:19.110
And you can't get it through that book, cuz it has to have a certain narrative.

288
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:24.150
How many people who are a little older are giddy when they find

289
00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:28.030
young talent? Oh yeah. How inspiring it is, how exciting it is.

290
00:15:28.031 --> 00:15:30.950
Like when you talk to these kids who are doing things on the internet or write

291
00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.260
whatever achievement you want them to flourish, you don't,

292
00:15:34.261 --> 00:15:37.380
you're not threatened by them as the antagonists of the fountain head are.

293
00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.740
And that doesn't come through in the fountain head because of it depends.

294
00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.260
<v 1>On your profession. Right? I mean for,</v>

295
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.380
so these parts of the world are better than others. If you're an,

296
00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:49.380
if you're an artist, at least the way I can see Viv art, uh, and you,

297
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:54.250
you wanna go study art today. You're gonna be pooed and look down on and,

298
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:58.210
and so on. So, so yeah, I agree. I mean, and, and in my gen, when I read,

299
00:15:58.211 --> 00:16:01.530
I went, you know, there was no internet. There was, and I was in Israel,

300
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:05.770
so we were isolated and there was nobody else who has shared their ideas.

301
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:09.810
And he did feel that kind of isolation and, and, but Royal gave you to me.

302
00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:12.520
He didn't teach me about, you know,

303
00:16:12.521 --> 00:16:16.280
you're gonna be isolated cuz partially it's cuz I wasn't

304
00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.040
um, maybe I was, I was humble. Right.

305
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:22.833
<v 2>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

306
00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.520
<v 1>When I, when I read Atlas shrug, I identified with Eddie Willis. Okay.</v>

307
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:31.560
When I read Deon hit, I didn't identify.

308
00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.430
<v 2>With Howard work. You read the fountain head.</v>

309
00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:37.150
<v 1>So I read Atlas when I was 16. I probably read at, uh,</v>

310
00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:41.270
found head when I was 16 and a half 17. Something like that. That is UN and I,

311
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:42.263
and I read, you read the.

312
00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.870
<v 2>Fountain head after Atlas shrug. Yeah. If anyone listening to this,</v>

313
00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:46.070
they should read, found head for,

314
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:50.190
if you read fountain head for me after Atlas shrug. No that is a war crime. No,

315
00:16:50.191 --> 00:16:51.024
for me.

316
00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:53.540
<v 1>By the way, reading Atlas shrug was much you.</v>

317
00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:54.540
<v 2>Out number it is more important.</v>

318
00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:59.180
But my point is I think the fountain head in many ways is redundant in certain

319
00:16:59.181 --> 00:16:59.680
aspects.

320
00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.180
If you read Atlas shrug first and because the found head is such a masterful

321
00:17:03.181 --> 00:17:05.140
book and such a personal book. I.

322
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.740
<v 1>Agree. I agree with, I agree with that. So.</v>

323
00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:09.500
<v 2>Ideally you would read the found head. That's what I'm saying. Yes. Um, but,</v>

324
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.540
and here's the other thing people don't appreciate. I'm sorry to interrupt you.

325
00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.730
Uh, people think Rand's always about politics, politics, politic politics.

326
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:18.290
The found head is not a political book at all. It's about, well,

327
00:17:18.291 --> 00:17:21.370
she talks about it. Politics man soul. Sure, sure. But it's about ethics.

328
00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.210
How important everyone has to have a moral code.

329
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:26.370
That's the other thing why people find Randolph putting,

330
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:31.450
if you have young people who now find it very important to live a moral

331
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:36.000
life who are like, what does that mean? To have morality, to have ethics,

332
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.600
to live with integrity,

333
00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:43.000
for people who have gotten a little older who have made these little sacrifices

334
00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:44.960
who are like, I'm not gonna fight at work.

335
00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:48.640
Do I really need to look for another job? Yeah. My wife's kind of, you know,

336
00:17:48.641 --> 00:17:50.880
getting annoying, but am I gonna make a fight about it?

337
00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:55.200
These little sacrifices that they make every day and big ones and big ones?

338
00:17:55.400 --> 00:18:00.320
Oh absolutely. So when you have someone who's saying forcing you yep.

339
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:05.360
To look in the mirror and say those little sacrifices and bigs actually made you

340
00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:09.670
did the wrong thing and you're evading that you betrayed your unconscious.

341
00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.830
That to many people I think is very threatening.

342
00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:17.910
<v 1>But this is why so many people say that iron Rand is for 14 year old boys.</v>

343
00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.510
Yeah. Right, right. A lot of it.

344
00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:24.310
And there's a reason why there's a reason why it appeals to to 14 is a little

345
00:18:24.311 --> 00:18:25.910
young, but, but 16, 18. Yeah.

346
00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:30.020
It's because those are the ages where we we're still open to ideally idealism in

347
00:18:30.021 --> 00:18:34.620
a positive sense. Right. To, to, to beautiful things, to ideals, to, to, to,

348
00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.140
to seeking perfection. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; to seeking, uh,

349
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:41.140
to seeking a great life. I think as you go older, most people become cynical.

350
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:42.740
They give up on their ideals. Why?

351
00:18:42.741 --> 00:18:45.780
Because their ideals were wrong and their ideas fail. Yeah. Right. My,

352
00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.860
my parents were socialists when they were young, those ideas failed.

353
00:18:48.861 --> 00:18:51.130
So where do you go for socialism for your ideals? Fail cynicism.

354
00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:52.050
<v 2>Yeah. The cynicism, which.</v>

355
00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:56.330
<v 1>Is horrible. All adults, almost all adults out there are cynical. And,</v>

356
00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:58.850
and that is, that is, that is fail the idealism.

357
00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:02.730
And when they look at the young people, they see their idealism. Oh well that's,

358
00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:05.930
I was idealistic too. And they don't question the ideal,

359
00:19:05.931 --> 00:19:07.530
well they're good ideals and they're bad ideals,

360
00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:10.640
the right ideals and the wrong ideals. And uh, and,

361
00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.160
and that's why they attributed to, to, they attributed to you.

362
00:19:13.161 --> 00:19:17.280
So it's a threat to a lot of people, a lot of people who it's too late for,

363
00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.920
for some people it's too late to change their minds. And, and, and they know it.

364
00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:26.040
And, and they've, they've too invested in the, in the job in the wife, in the,

365
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.640
in the compromises, in the comfort.

366
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:28.833
<v 2>In the comfort.</v>

367
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.030
<v 1>In the, and they're too invested in the comfort too, to,</v>

368
00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:33.150
to invest in a compromise, to invest in a comfort.

369
00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:37.270
And they know that they shouldn't be, they know they should change.

370
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:40.910
And these young people are challenging that, and that is really,

371
00:19:40.911 --> 00:19:42.510
really scary for them. And that's,

372
00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:45.870
that's why they rejected without even without too much consideration.

373
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:46.950
<v 2>One, one of the things Rand,</v>

374
00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:49.190
the working title for fountain head was secondhand lives.

375
00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:52.620
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and Rand had too definite of selfishness in that book.

376
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.580
One is selfishness in the sense of my life is the most important thing.

377
00:19:56.581 --> 00:19:59.820
It's not the only important thing. Uh, my family would be number two friends.

378
00:19:59.821 --> 00:20:01.380
They certainly are extremely high values,

379
00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.180
but you can't have these secondary values without.

380
00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.100
<v 1>The first value, but in the context of my life, right.</v>

381
00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.100
Cuz your family might not be a value. Right, right, right.

382
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.900
You might hate your parents. Sure. The.

383
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.690
<v 2>Point being selfishness, then there's the other kind of selfishness,</v>

384
00:20:13.691 --> 00:20:15.610
which is Peter Keating. When the villains of the book,

385
00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:19.930
which is he's selfish in that he's greedy. He's looking out for number one,

386
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:24.690
but he has no values. He has no sense of character. He just wants to be wealthy.

387
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:27.730
He wants to have a beautiful wife. He wants to have a big house.

388
00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:31.130
Why he couldn't tell you because other people have it and he wants to have it

389
00:20:31.131 --> 00:20:35.480
more than them. His sense of reference is other people he's living secondhand.

390
00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.040
What the problem with that is a lot of young people read Rand.

391
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:43.440
And when they start arguing online, they just start trying to talk like Rand.

392
00:20:43.441 --> 00:20:46.120
Whereas Rand would be like the original, be an innovator.

393
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:50.080
If you wanna argue for objective and Rand's views, take her ideas,

394
00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:51.680
articulate them in your own way.

395
00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.240
Cuz that's a good way of showing that you understand what she thinks,

396
00:20:55.241 --> 00:20:58.360
but what they end up doing is just talking like her mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it

397
00:20:58.361 --> 00:21:02.320
sounds dated and comical and that's gonna be off putting cuz it's like Rand

398
00:21:02.321 --> 00:21:06.280
wouldn't expect someone else to sound like Rand she's you know, her own person.

399
00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:06.990
And.

400
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:10.150
<v 1>She of course wouldn't view Keating as selfish in any sense, because,</v>

401
00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:13.270
or even greedy greed is a tricky word, but.

402
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:15.430
<v 2>Or selfish. Selfish is the old school sense.</v>

403
00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.310
<v 1>Yeah. He's selfish in the old, but, but even there, he,</v>

404
00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:22.630
it's not as if it's not as if he has some passion and he is going after passion,

405
00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:26.270
no matter what I'm going, you know, light sheet steel, I'm gonna, he,

406
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:30.220
he doesn't, his passion is painting. Right. And he doesn't pursue his passion.

407
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.660
He pursues what his mother wants to pursue. Right. Yeah.

408
00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.620
And he pursues money and he's,

409
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.340
he's completely secondhand in the sense that he follows other people's values,

410
00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:39.860
not his own.
