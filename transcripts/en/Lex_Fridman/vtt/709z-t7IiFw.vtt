00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.400
<v 0>Is that the source of, uh,</v>

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.600
if you were able to deconstruct like where some of your best ideas came from

3
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.660
do, is there a process that's at the core of that? Like, so some people,

4
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:18.960
you know, walk and think some people like in the shower,

5
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:21.690
the best ideas hit them. If you talk about like Newton,

6
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.860
Apple hitting him on the head.

7
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.100
<v 1>No, I, I, I found out a long time ago. Um, I processed things so much slowly.</v>

8
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.640
So like in college I had friends who could study at the last minute, get an,

9
00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:36.020
a next day. I can't do that at all. So I always front load at all the work.

10
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.100
Like I do all the problems early, you know, for finals,

11
00:00:40.101 --> 00:00:43.970
like the last three days, I wouldn't look at a book because I want, you know,

12
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.380
cause like a new fact day before finals may screw up my understanding of what I

13
00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:52.820
thought I knew. So it, my, my, my goal was to always get it in and,

14
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.780
and give it time to soak. And I used to, you know,

15
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.970
I remember when we were doing like 3d calculus,

16
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.720
I would have these amazing dreams of 3d surfaces for normal, you know,

17
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.920
cleaning the gradient. And it just was like all come up. So it was really fun,

18
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.440
like very visual. And, uh, and if I got cycles of that, that was useful.

19
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.400
Um, and the other is, is don't over filter your ideas. Like,

20
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.770
I like that process of brainstorming where lots of ideas can happen.

21
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.770
I like people who have lots of ideas, but then there's a, yeah,

22
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.360
I'll let them sit and let it breathe a little bit and then reduce it to

23
00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:32.390
practice. Like at some point you really have to,

24
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.510
does it really work? Like, is this real or not? Right.

25
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.390
But you, but you have to do both there's creative tension there.

26
00:01:41.391 --> 00:01:45.320
Like how do you be both open and precise?

27
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.570
<v 0>Have you had ideas that you just that's in your mind for like years before the</v>

28
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.860
sure. Isn't interesting. A way to

29
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.780
generate ideas and just let them sit, let them sit there for awhile.

30
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.260
I think I have a few of those ideas.

31
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.630
<v 1>Yeah. That was so funny. Yeah. I think that's, you know, creativity,</v>

32
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:09.740
uh, this one or something.

33
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.710
<v 0>For the slow thinkers in the, in the room, I suppose. Cause I, some people,</v>

34
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.230
like you said are just like, like the.

35
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.890
<v 1>Yeah, it's really interesting. There's so much diversity in how people think,</v>

36
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.470
you know, how fast or slow they are, how well they remember don't, you know,

37
00:02:27.471 --> 00:02:30.830
I'm not super good at remembering facts, but processes and methods,

38
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.420
like an orange theory.

39
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.440
I went to Penn state and almost all our engineering tests were open book.

40
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.120
I could remember the page and not the formula, but as soon as I saw the formula,

41
00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:45.500
I could remember the whole method if I, if I learned it, you know?

42
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.650
So it was just a funny where some people could, you know,

43
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.780
I just watched friends like flipping through the book,

44
00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:55.040
trying to find the formula, even knowing that they'd done just as much work.

45
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.820
And I would just open the book and I was on page 27, bottom half.

46
00:02:58.821 --> 00:03:02.560
I could see the whole thing visually. Yeah. You know.

47
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.850
<v 0>And you have to learn that about yourself and figure out what the function</v>

48
00:03:05.851 --> 00:03:06.630
optimally. Yeah.

49
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.490
<v 1>I had a friend who, who was always concerned.</v>

50
00:03:08.491 --> 00:03:12.300
He didn't know how he came up with ideas. He had lots of ideas, but he said,

51
00:03:12.301 --> 00:03:15.330
they just sort of popped up. Like, he'd be working on something,

52
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.220
you had this idea. And it was like, where does it come from?

53
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.160
But you can have more awareness of it. Like, like, like how you,

54
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.520
how your brain works is a little murky as you go down from the voice in your

55
00:03:26.521 --> 00:03:30.310
head or the obvious visualizations. Like when you visualize something,

56
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.230
how does that happen? You know, if I say, you know, visualize volcano,

57
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.220
it's easy to do it. Right.

58
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.500
<v 0>What does it actually look like when you visualize it?</v>

59
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.770
<v 1>I can visualize to the point where I don't see the very much out of my eyes and</v>

60
00:03:40.771 --> 00:03:42.480
I see the colors of the thing I'm visualizing.

61
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.350
<v 0>Yeah. But there's like a sh there's a shape. There's a texture, there's a color,</v>

62
00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:48.330
but there's also conceptual visualization.

63
00:03:48.331 --> 00:03:52.350
Like what are you actually visualizing when you visualize it in volcano?

64
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.870
Just like with peripheral vision, you think you see the whole thing.

65
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.170
<v 1>That's a good way to say it. You know, you have this kind of,</v>

66
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.310
almost peripheral vision of your visualizations are like these ghosts.

67
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.340
But you know, if you, if you work on it,

68
00:04:05.341 --> 00:04:07.170
you can get a pretty high level of detail.

69
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.080
<v 0>And somehow you can walk along those visualizations that come up from the</v>

70
00:04:10.081 --> 00:04:11.430
Nigeria, which is a.

71
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.770
<v 1>But when you're thinking about solving problems, like you're,</v>

72
00:04:16.771 --> 00:04:21.090
you're putting information and you're exercising the stuff you do know you're

73
00:04:21.091 --> 00:04:25.320
sort of teasing the area that you don't understand and don't know,

74
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.030
but you can almost, you know, feel, you know,

75
00:04:30.031 --> 00:04:33.360
that process happening. You know, that's, that's how I like,

76
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.010
like, like I know sometimes when I'm working really hard on something like,

77
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.100
like I get really hot when I'm sleeping and you know, it's like,

78
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.510
we got the blanket throw a couple of all the blankets are on the floor and,

79
00:04:45.511 --> 00:04:50.460
you know, while we wake up and think, wow, that was great, you know?

80
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.730
<v 0>Well, to, uh, to reverse engineer, what the hell happened there?</v>

81
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.540
<v 1>Oh, sometimes it's vivid dreams. And sometimes it's just kind of, like you say,</v>

82
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.680
like shadow thinking that you sort of have this feeling or you're going through

83
00:05:01.681 --> 00:05:03.570
this stuff, but it's, it's not that obvious.

84
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.920
<v 0>Isn't that so amazing that the mind just does all these little experiments.</v>

85
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.350
I never, you know, I thought, I always thought, um,

86
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.320
it's like a river that you can't, you're just there for the ride,

87
00:05:13.321 --> 00:05:14.830
but you're right. If you prep it.

88
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.120
<v 1>No, it's, it's, it's all understandable. Meditation really helps you.</v>

89
00:05:19.121 --> 00:05:22.080
You got to start figuring out, you need to learn language of your own mind

90
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.130
and there's multiple levels of it, but abstractions again, right.

91
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.080
It's somewhat comprehensible and observable and feelable or whatever

92
00:05:34.081 --> 00:05:38.310
the right word is. Yeah. You're not along for the ride.

93
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:39.930
You are the ride.
