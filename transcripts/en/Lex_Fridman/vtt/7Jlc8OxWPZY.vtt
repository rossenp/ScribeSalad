00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.590
<v 0>I mean, it makes me a little bit sad because your work is both,</v>

2
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.030
um, from a computer science perspective, fascinating.

3
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.630
And the inference engine from a epistological philosophical aspect.

4
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.230
Fascinating, but you know, it is also,

5
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.070
you're running a company and there's some stuff that has to remain private.

6
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.860
I it's sad.

7
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.220
<v 1>Well, here, here's something that may make you feel better.</v>

8
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:31.140
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; a little bit better. Um, we're um, we've formed a, uh,

9
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.580
not, not for profit company, uh,

10
00:00:33.581 --> 00:00:37.380
called the knowledge X immunization Institute next K ax mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

11
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.620
And I have this firm belief with a lot of empirical evidence to

12
00:00:42.621 --> 00:00:45.490
support it, that the,

13
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.570
the education that people get in high schools in colleges,

14
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.650
in graduate schools and so on is almost completely

15
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.090
orthogonal to almost completely irrelevant to

16
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.450
how good they're going to be at coming up to speed in doing this kind of

17
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.280
ontological engineering and writing these assertions and rules and so on

18
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.000
in, in psych.

19
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.720
And so very often we'll interview candidates who have their PhD in

20
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.920
philosophy. Who've taught logic for years and so on, and they're just,

21
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.520
they're just awful, but the converse is true.

22
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.230
So one of the best ontological engineers we ever had never graduated high

23
00:01:26.231 --> 00:01:29.230
school. And so the purpose of, um,

24
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.150
knowledge Institute, if we can get some,

25
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.590
some foundations to help support it is identify people in the general

26
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.190
population, maybe high school,

27
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.670
dropouts who have latent talent for this sort of thing,

28
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.590
um,

29
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.580
offer them effectively scholarships to train them and then

30
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.300
help place them in companies that need more trained ontological

31
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.540
engineers, some of which would be working for us,

32
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.980
but mostly would be working for partners or customers or something.

33
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.420
And if we could do that,

34
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.690
that would create an enormous number of relatively very high paying jobs

35
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:12.810
for people who currently, um, have no, no way out of some,

36
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.490
you know, um, situation that they're locked into.

37
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.650
<v 0>So is there something you can put into words that describes somebody</v>

38
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.930
who would be great at ontological engineering?

39
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.960
So what characteristics about a person make them a great at this

40
00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:29.430
task,

41
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.240
this task of converting the messiness of

42
00:02:34.241 --> 00:02:36.960
human language and knowledge yes. Into formal.

43
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.640
<v 1>Logic. This is very much like what, um,</v>

44
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.560
Alan touring had to do during world war II, uh,

45
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.310
in trying to find people to bring to Bley park where he would publish

46
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.390
in the London times, cryptic crossword puzzles, along with some,

47
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.430
some innocuous looking note, which essentially said if,

48
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.510
if you were able to solve this puzzle in less than 15 minutes,

49
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.680
please call this phone number &lt;laugh&gt; and so on. So, um, you know,

50
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.440
or, uh, back when I was young, there was, uh, uh, the practice of having,

51
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.200
uh, matchbooks where on the inside of the matchbook, um, there would be a,

52
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.800
can you draw this? You have a career in art, mm-hmm,

53
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.150
&lt;affirmative&gt; a commercial art, if you can copy this, uh, drawing, you know,

54
00:03:20.151 --> 00:03:23.670
and so on. So, um, yes, the, the analog of that was there.

55
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.550
<v 0>A little test to get to the core of whether you're gonna be good or.</v>

56
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.310
<v 1>Not. So part of it has to do with, uh, being able to, um,</v>

57
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.110
make and appreciate, um, um,

58
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.750
and react negatively appropriately to puns and other jokes. So you have to, uh,

59
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:42.620
have a kind of sense of humor and if you're good at, uh, telling jokes and,

60
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.140
um, good at understanding jokes, that's, that's one indicator like pun. Yes.

61
00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.220
Like dad jokes. Yes. Well, maybe not dad jokes, but real but funny jokes. Um,

62
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.420
but, uh, I.

63
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.340
<v 0>Think I'm applying to work at psych court &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

64
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.300
<v 1>Yeah. But, um,</v>

65
00:03:56.301 --> 00:04:00.530
another another is if you're able to introspect so very all often, um,

66
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.170
uh, we'll, we'll give someone a simple question and we'll say like, um, um,

67
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.010
what, why, why is this? And, you know, sometimes they'll just say,

68
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.570
because it is okay, that's a bad sign,

69
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.610
but very often they'll be able to introspect and so on. So one of the questions,

70
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.120
um, I often ask is I'll point to a sentence with a pronoun in it. And I'll say,

71
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.040
um, you know, the referend of that pronoun is obviously this now and over here,

72
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.160
um, you know, how would you or I, or an AI or a five year old,

73
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.160
10 year old child know that that pronoun refers to that now and

74
00:04:37.161 --> 00:04:40.990
over here. Um, and um, often, um,

75
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.310
the people who are going to be good at ontological engineering will give me some

76
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.350
causal explanation or will refer to some things that are true in the world.

77
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.110
So if you imagine a sentence,

78
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.750
like the horse was led into the barn while its head was still wet mm-hmm

79
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.030
&lt;affirmative&gt;. And so its head refers to the horse's head,

80
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.940
but how do you know that? So some people will say, I just know it.

81
00:05:02.941 --> 00:05:03.940
Some people will say, well,

82
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.260
the horse was the subject of the sentence and I'll say, okay, well,

83
00:05:07.261 --> 00:05:11.140
what about the horse was led into the barn while its roof was still wet.

84
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.620
Now it's roof obviously refers to the barn. Um, and so then they'll say,

85
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.460
oh, well, that's because it's the closest noun. And so,

86
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.290
so basically if they try to give me the answers,

87
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.570
which are based on syntax and grammar and so on,

88
00:05:26.571 --> 00:05:30.290
that's a really bad sign. But if they're able to say things like, well,

89
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.210
horses have heads and barns don't and barns have roofs and horses don't um,

90
00:05:35.211 --> 00:05:38.690
then that's a positive sign that they're gonna be good at this because they can

91
00:05:38.691 --> 00:05:43.400
introspect on what's true in the world that leads you to know certain things.

92
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.800
How.

93
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.560
<v 0>Fascinating is it that getting a PhD makes you less capable to introspect</v>

94
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.480
deeply about this?

95
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.680
<v 1>Oh, I'm not. I wouldn't, I wouldn't be that far.</v>

96
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.480
I'm not saying that it makes you less capable.

97
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.520
Let's just say it's independent of, oh, I don't know of how.

98
00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.480
<v 0>Good people are. You're not saying that I'm saying that there's a certain,</v>

99
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.040
it's interesting that for a lot of people, uh, PhDs, uh, sorry,

100
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.840
philosophy aside that sometimes education narrows your thinking

101
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.960
versus expands it. Yes. It's kind of fascinating. And for certain,

102
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.750
when you're trying to do on theological engineering,

103
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.390
which is essentially teach our future AI overlords,

104
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.550
how to reason deeply about this world and how to understand it,

105
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.110
that that requires that you think deeply about the world.

106
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.070
<v 1>So I'll, I'll tell you a sad story about math craft,</v>

107
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.950
which is why is that not widely used in schools today? Um, we're not,

108
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.420
not really trying to make big profit on it or anything like that. The,

109
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.940
when we we've gone to schools, their attitude has been well.

110
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.180
If a student spends 20 hours going through this math craft program

111
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.780
from start to end and so on, um,

112
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:57.180
will it improve their score on this standardized test?

113
00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.410
More than if they spent 20 hours just doing mindless drills of

114
00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:06.650
problem after problem after problem. And the answer is, well, no,

115
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.690
but it'll increase their understanding more. And their attitude is, well,

116
00:07:09.691 --> 00:07:14.330
if it doesn't increase their score on this test, um, then that's not,

117
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.050
you know, we're not gonna adopt it.
