00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.100
<v 0>When you were thinking about what people like from,</v>

2
00:00:06.101 --> 00:00:09.220
where did you get a sense that this is what people like you, you,

3
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.340
you said you sat down, we wrote some stuff down on paper.

4
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.900
Where is that intuition?

5
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.600
That seems fundamental to the success of an app,

6
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.840
like Instagram. Where does that idea? Where does that list?

7
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.910
Where things come from exactly.

8
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.870
<v 1>Only after having studied machine learning now for a couple years. Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.790
<v 0>I like, I have a, you have understood yourself. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

10
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.540
<v 1>I I've started to make connections. Like we can go into this later,</v>

11
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.860
but obviously the, the, um,

12
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.940
the connections between machine learning and the human brain,

13
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.900
I think are stretched sometimes, right? At the same time,

14
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.660
being able to back prop and being able to like, look at the world,

15
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.940
try something. Yeah. Figure out how you're wrong, how wrong you are,

16
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.380
and then nudge your company in the right direction.

17
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.050
Based on how wrong you are is like got fascinating concept. Right. And I don't,

18
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.890
we didn't know we were doing it at the time,

19
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.530
but that's basically what we were doing. Right.

20
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.370
We put it out to call it a hundred people

21
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.290
and you would look at their data. You would say, what are they sharing? What,

22
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.090
like, what resonates, what doesn't resonate.

23
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.760
We think they're gonna resonate with X, but turns out they resonate with Y okay.

24
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.440
Shift the company towards why. And it turns out if you do that enough,

25
00:01:29.441 --> 00:01:34.040
quickly enough, you can get to a solution that has product market fit.

26
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.600
Most companies fail because they sit there and they don't either their learning

27
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.160
rates too slow. They sit there and they just they're adamant that they're right.

28
00:01:42.161 --> 00:01:46.310
Even though the data's telling them they're not right. Or they,

29
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.510
their learning rates too high and they wildly chase different ideas.

30
00:01:49.511 --> 00:01:53.230
And they never actually set on, on one where, where they don't groove. Right.

31
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.230
And I think when we sat down and we wrote out those three ideas,

32
00:01:56.231 --> 00:01:58.990
what we were saying is what are the three possible?

33
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.390
Whether they're local or global max in our world, right.

34
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.060
That users are to telling us they like,

35
00:02:07.061 --> 00:02:10.660
because they're using the product that way, it was clear people like the photos,

36
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.300
cuz that was the thing they were doing. And we just said, okay,

37
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.060
like what if we just cut out most of the other stuff and focus on that thing.

38
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.300
Um, and then it happened to be a multi-billion dollar business. And &lt;laugh&gt;,

39
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.100
it's that easy by the way.

40
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.140
<v 0>Yeah. I, I guess so. Um,</v>

41
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.850
well nobody ever writes about neural networks that miserably failed. So this,

42
00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:32.690
this particular neural network succeeded.

43
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.810
<v 1>They sell all.</v>

44
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.730
<v 0>The time, right? Yeah. But nobody writes about the default state is.</v>

45
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.563
<v 1>Failing. Yes.</v>

46
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.250
<v 0>Um, when you said the way people are using the app,</v>

47
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.050
is that the loss function for this neural network or is it also self-report

48
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.240
like, do you ever ask people what they like or do you have to track exact what

49
00:02:52.241 --> 00:02:53.600
they're doing? Not what they're saying.

50
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.760
<v 1>I once made a Thanksgiving dinner. Okay. And, uh,</v>

51
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.640
it for relatives and I like to cook a lot. Okay.

52
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.320
And I worked really hard on picking the specific, uh, dishes and,

53
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.980
and,

54
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.000
and I was really proud because I had planned it out using a Gantt char and like,

55
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.960
it was ready on time and everything was hot. Nice. Like,

56
00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:17.480
I don't know if you're a big Thanksgiving guy,

57
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.590
but like the worst thing in about Thanksgiving is when the Turkey's cold and

58
00:03:21.591 --> 00:03:23.630
some things are hot and some things anyway, you.

59
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:24.583
<v 0>Had a Gant chart.</v>

60
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.590
<v 1>Did you actually have a chart? Oh yeah. Yeah. Omni plan, fairly expensive,</v>

61
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.510
like Gant chart thing that I think maybe 10 people have purchased in the world,

62
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.670
but I'm one of them. And I use it for recipe planning only around big holidays.

63
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:39.660
That's.

64
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.900
<v 0>By the way, do people do.</v>

65
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.780
<v 1>This kind of, uh over-engineering &lt;laugh&gt; it's not over.</v>

66
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.740
<v 0>It's just engineering. It's planning. Like Thanksgiving is a complicated, uh,</v>

67
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.180
set of events with some uncertainty, with a lot of things going on.

68
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.020
You should be able, you should be planning it in this way.

69
00:03:54.021 --> 00:03:55.380
There should be a chart it's not.

70
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.970
<v 1>Over, over. I mean, so what's funny is, um, brief aside. Yes. Uh,</v>

71
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.650
it's brilliant. I love cooking. I love food. I love coffee.

72
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.810
And I've spent some time with some chefs who like know their stuff and

73
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.490
they always just take out a piece of paper and just work backwards in rough

74
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.450
order. Like it's never perfect, but rough order. It's just like, oh,

75
00:04:15.451 --> 00:04:18.850
that makes sense. Why not just work backwards from, from the end goal. Right.

76
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:19.970
And put in some buffer to,

77
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.120
and so I probably over specified it a bit using a Gant chart,

78
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:29.000
but the fact that you can do it, it's what professional kitchens roughly do.

79
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.840
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; they just don't call it a Gant chart or at least I don't

80
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:34.520
think they do. Um, anyway, I was telling a story about Thanksgiving.

81
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.520
So here's uh, here's the thing I'm sitting down. We have the meal and then I'm,

82
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.750
you know, know,

83
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.590
I got to know Ray Dalio fairly well over maybe the last year of Instagram.

84
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.390
Um, and one thing that he kept saying was like,

85
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.350
feedback is really hard to get honestly, from people.

86
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.590
And I sat down at, at, after dinner. I said, guys, I want feedback.

87
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.700
What was good and what was bad. Yes. And what is like,

88
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.340
literally everyone just said everything was great.

89
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.340
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and I like personally knew I had screwed up a handful of

90
00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:10.940
things. Um, but no one would say it.

91
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.900
And can you imagine now not something as high stakes as Thanksgiving dinner.

92
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.860
Okay. Thanksgiving dinner. It's not that high stakes.

93
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.380
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but you're trying to build a product and everyone knows you

94
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.610
love after job for it.

95
00:05:22.611 --> 00:05:25.210
And you're trying to build it out and you're trying to make something wonderful.

96
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.130
And it's yours. Right? You designed it now,

97
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.450
try asking for feedback and know that you're giving this to your friends and

98
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:35.284
your family.

99
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.050
People have trouble giving hard feedback. People have trouble saying,

100
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.640
I, I don't like this or this isn't great. Or this is how it's failed me.

101
00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.680
In fact, um, you usually have two classes of people,

102
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.320
people who just won't say bad things, you can literally say to them,

103
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.800
please tell me what you hate most about this. And they won't do it. They'll try,

104
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.813
but they won't.

105
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.720
And then the other class of people are just negative period about everything.

106
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.480
And it's hard to parse out like what is true and what isn't mm-hmm

107
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.280
&lt;affirmative&gt;. So my rule of thumb with this is you should always ask people,

108
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.150
but at the end of the day, it's amazing what data will tell you.

109
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.790
And that's why with whatever project I work on,

110
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.270
even now collecting data from the beginning on usage patterns.

111
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.950
So engagement, how many days of the week do they use it? How many?

112
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.350
I don't know if we were to go back to Instagram, how many impressions per day,

113
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.190
right. Is that growing? Is that shrinking?

114
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.940
And don't be like overly scientific about it, right?

115
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.620
Cause maybe you have 50 baby users or something,

116
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.140
but what's fascinating is that data doesn't lie.

117
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.180
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; people are very, uh, defensive about their time.

118
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.180
They'll say, oh, I'm so busy. I'm sorry, I didn't get to use the app. Like,

119
00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:56.860
I'm just, you know, um,

120
00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.010
but I don't know you're posting on Instagram the whole time.

121
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.790
So I don't know. At the end of the day, like at Facebook, there was, you know,

122
00:07:05.791 --> 00:07:09.790
before time spent became kind of this loaded term there,

123
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.430
the idea that people people's currency in their lives is time.

124
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.780
And they only have a certain amount of time to give things whether it's or

125
00:07:18.781 --> 00:07:21.260
family or apps or TV shows or whatever, it's,

126
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.420
there's no way of inventing more of it. At least not that I know of

127
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.080
if they don't use it, it's because it's not great.

128
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.880
So the moral of this story is you can ask all you want,

129
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.680
but you just have to look at the data and data doesn't lie.

130
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:39.750
Right?

131
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.670
<v 0>I mean, there's metrics there's, um,</v>

132
00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:48.110
data can obscure the key insight if you're not careful.

133
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:52.150
So, so time spent in the app, that's one,

134
00:07:52.151 --> 00:07:54.990
there's so many metrics you can put at this and they will give you totally

135
00:07:54.991 --> 00:07:55.990
different insights,

136
00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.780
especially when you're trying to create something that doesn't obviously exist

137
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.860
yet. So, you know, um,

138
00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:09.500
measuring maybe why you left the app or measuring

139
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.060
special moments of happiness,

140
00:08:12.061 --> 00:08:16.140
that will make sure you return to the app or moments of happiness that are long

141
00:08:16.141 --> 00:08:21.130
lasting versus like dopamine short term, all of those things. But I think,

142
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.170
I suppose in the beginning, you,

143
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.330
you can just get away with just asking the question,

144
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.690
which features are used a lot. Let's do more of that.
