1
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.740
<v 0>Which is why I'd like to give Richard Wolf a shout out for being an intellectual</v>

2
00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:09.000
who talks about communism.

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.280
I think it takes kind of a heroic intellectual right now to speak about

4
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.260
like communism. Seriously.

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.510
There's difficult waters to tread that the expression there's difficult

6
00:00:21.511 --> 00:00:22.344
paths to war.

7
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.980
<v 1>I love watching a robot try to use idiom in a language.</v>

8
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.600
<v 0>Zero zero one, one I'm I'm, uh,</v>

9
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.600
quite deeply hurt by the binary comment. Are you.

10
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.730
<v 1>Your, your feeling has gone from one to zero. Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:38.660
What is it?

12
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.640
<v 0>My buffers have overflown, uh, though, but there's difficult. I,</v>

13
00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:46.430
I feel like communism is, uh,

14
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.680
like universally seen as a bad thing currently in intellectual circles. Yes.

15
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.800
Actually, maybe some people disagree with that. People say like far, far left,

16
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.190
people are trying to, you know, there's, some people will argue the,

17
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.440
the BLM movement is some kind of Marxist. I mean,

18
00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:08.150
I don't know. I don't really follow the deep logic in that, whatever, but, uh.

19
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.850
<v 1>It was just, well, they said they were formed by Marxism,</v>

20
00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:11.850
the founder co-founder yeah.

21
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.070
<v 0>Stating that is different than, um.</v>

22
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.730
<v 1>There's, there's marks the totalitarian. There's also marks to revolutionary.</v>

23
00:01:19.731 --> 00:01:22.070
And I think they're talking more like we're revolutionaries,

24
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.993
we're going to overthrow this.

25
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.020
<v 0>Well. Yeah. Right. But like w w we can have that for the discussion, but I,</v>

26
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.370
I just don't think they speak deeply about, uh, political systems of,

27
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.020
and saying communism is, uh, is going to be the righteous system that, you know,

28
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.600
th there's not a deep intellectual discourse, what I mean,

29
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.260
but if you were to try to be on stage with the Jordan Peterson,

30
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.470
like to me, the brave thing now,

31
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.360
like it would be to argue for communism may be interesting to see not many

32
00:01:50.361 --> 00:01:54.020
people do it. Uh, I certainly wouldn't be willing to do it. I don't have enough.

33
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.720
I don't, first of all, don't believe it. But second of all,

34
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.350
it's a very difficult argument to make, because you will get so much fire,

35
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.210
which is why, like Richard Wolf.

36
00:02:02.211 --> 00:02:07.010
He's one of the people who was quite rigorously showing that there's some

37
00:02:07.011 --> 00:02:11.750
good ideas within the system of communism, uh, specifically saying that,

38
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.670
uh, attacking more the, the negative sides of capitalism.

39
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.160
So saying that there is, uh,

40
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.570
that capitalism potentially is more dangerous than communism. I mean, it's,

41
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.540
I disagree with that, but I think it's, uh, I love how.

42
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.200
<v 1>Something is. Like, we've got a body count of 60 million, but this,</v>

43
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.570
everything is put to, and potentially, you know,

44
00:02:32.571 --> 00:02:36.140
like water can drown everyone on earth. So this is incoherent.

45
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.770
<v 0>I think nuclear weapons are bad, but nuclear energy is good.</v>

46
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.850
<v 1>Sure. So your weapons are also can be good. You can easily make the argument,</v>

47
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:48.230
which I don't know that I subscribe to that nuclear weapons prevented, uh,

48
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.890
boots on the ground war at all, costs me much more.

49
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.510
<v 0>And th they're also quite,</v>

50
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.630
quite effective at changing the direction of an asteroid.

51
00:02:56.631 --> 00:02:59.710
That's about to hit earth as I've learned from a movie.

52
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.300
<v 2>Again. And they're actually useful as you know, I must cause as claimed for, uh,</v>

53
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.350
uh, for applications for prior to colonizing Mars,

54
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.650
making it more habitable. Oh, okay. So,

55
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.830
uh, but yes, but, well,

56
00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.570
I guess what I'm saying is there's the place for nuance and there's some topics

57
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.700
so hot, like communism when you announce is very difficult to, to have.

58
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.880
And that I feel like with Nazi Germany,

59
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.520
it was a similar thing at the time.
