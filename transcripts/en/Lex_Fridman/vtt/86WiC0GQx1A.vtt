00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.960
<v 0>What do you think about Bitcoin?</v>

2
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.710
What do you think it is a response to what are the growing problems of the Fiat

3
00:00:09.711 --> 00:00:10.544
system?

4
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.620
What is this moment in human history that is full of challenges

5
00:00:15.621 --> 00:00:18.200
that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies trying to overcome?

6
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.230
<v 1>I don't think Bitcoin was devised by Satoshi,</v>

7
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.400
whoever he was for fear of

8
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.620
a breakdown of the Fiat currencies. If it was,

9
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.890
it was a very far sighted enterprise because certainly in 2008,

10
00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:38.600
when the first Bitcoin paper appeared,

11
00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:42.950
it wasn't very likely that a wave of inflation was coming. If anything,

12
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.280
there was more reason to fear deflation at that point,

13
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.260
I think it would be more accurate to say that with the

14
00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:52.850
advent of the internet,

15
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.750
there was a need for a means of payment native to the internet,

16
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.680
typing your credit card number into random websites,

17
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.920
not the way to pay for things on the internet.

18
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.880
And I'd rather think of Bitcoin as the first iteration,

19
00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:11.600
the first attempt to solve the problem of how do we pay for things in what we

20
00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:13.070
must learn to call the metaverse,

21
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.280
but let's just call it the internet for all time's sake.

22
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.330
And ever since that initial, uh, innovation,

23
00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:24.410
that realization that you could use computing power and cryptography to create

24
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.740
peer to peer payments without third party verification,

25
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.350
a revolution has been gathering momentum that poses a very profound threat to

26
00:01:33.351 --> 00:01:36.980
the existing legacy system of banks and, and Viet currencies.

27
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.600
Most money in the world today is made by banks, north central banks, banks.

28
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.470
That's what most money is it's entries in bank accounts.

29
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.810
And what Bitcoin represents is an alternative mode of

30
00:01:50.811 --> 00:01:54.410
payment that really ought to run the banks obsolete.

31
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.740
I think this financial revolution has got past the point at which it can be

32
00:02:00.741 --> 00:02:03.470
killed. It was vulnerable in the early years,

33
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.810
but it now has sufficient adoption and has generated sufficient additional

34
00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:13.100
layers. I mean, the theorem was in many ways, the more important innovation,

35
00:02:13.101 --> 00:02:15.680
because you can build a whole system of,

36
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.860
of payments and ultimately smart contracts on top of ether.

37
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.550
I think we've now reached the point that it's pretty hard to imagine it all

38
00:02:22.551 --> 00:02:25.880
being killed and it's just survived an amazing thing,

39
00:02:25.881 --> 00:02:28.820
which was the Chinese shutting down mining and shutting down everything.

40
00:02:28.821 --> 00:02:33.320
And still here we are. Uh, in fact, crypto is thriving.

41
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.410
What we don't know is how much damage ill judged

42
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.570
regulatory interventions are going to do to this financial revolution left to

43
00:02:44.571 --> 00:02:45.620
its own devices.

44
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.510
I think decentralized finance provides the native

45
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.060
monitoring financial system for the internet.

46
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.380
And the more time we spend in the metaverse,

47
00:02:57.381 --> 00:03:01.000
the more use we will make of the next things that will happen.

48
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:05.530
I think we'll be that tokens end game spaces like roadblocks will become

49
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:10.420
fungible as my nine-year-old spends a lot more time playing on

50
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.340
computer games than I ever did.

51
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.290
I can see the entertainment is becoming a game driven phenomenon.

52
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.920
And in the game space, you need skins for your avatar,

53
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.450
the economics of the internet. It's evolving very fast.

54
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.560
And in parallel, you can see this payments revolution happening.

55
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.690
I think that all that all goes naturally very well and generates an

56
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:37.360
enormous amounts of wealth and the process.

57
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.250
The problem is there are people in Washington with an

58
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.140
overwhelming urge to intervene and disrupt this evolutionary

59
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:48.813
process.

60
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.550
Partly I think out of a muddled sense that there must be a lot of

61
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:59.470
nefarious things going on. If we don't step in many more will go on this.

62
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.310
I think greatly exaggerates how much criminal activity is in fact going on in

63
00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:06.910
the space, but there's also the vested interests at work.

64
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.090
It was odd to me, maybe not hard,

65
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.020
perhaps it wasn't surprising that the bank for international settlements earlier

66
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:18.940
this year published a report, a one chapter of which said, this must all go,

67
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.700
let's all stop. It's all gotta be shut down.

68
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.560
And it's gotta be replaced by central bank, digital currency and Martin Wolf.

69
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.710
And the financial times read this and said, I agree with this. And one Sunday,

70
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.080
he realized that the banks are clever.

71
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.400
They had they'd achieved the intellectual counter attack, uh,

72
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.430
with, uh, almost no fingerprints on the weapon.

73
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.180
I think central bank digital currency is a terrible idea.

74
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.640
I can't imagine why we would want to copy a Chinese model that essentially

75
00:04:48.641 --> 00:04:51.910
takes all transactions and puts them directly under the surveillance of a

76
00:04:51.911 --> 00:04:53.110
central government institution.

77
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:57.730
But that suddenly is a serious

78
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.400
counter-proposal. So on the one side, we have a relatively decentralized

79
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.950
technologically innovative internet native system of

80
00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:13.120
payments that has the possibility to evolve, to produce a full sets of,

81
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.680
of smart contracts, reducing enormously.

82
00:05:17.681 --> 00:05:20.890
The transaction costs that we currently encounter in the financial world,

83
00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:24.760
because it gets rid of all those middleman who take that car every time you take

84
00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:29.140
out a mortgage or whatever it is, that's one alternative. But on the other side,

85
00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:33.370
we have a highly decentralized system in which transactions will by default be

86
00:05:33.371 --> 00:05:37.180
under the surveillance of the central bank. It seems like an easy choice to me,

87
00:05:37.181 --> 00:05:39.580
but Hey, I have this thing about personal Liberty.

88
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.380
So that's where we are. I don't think that the regulators can,

89
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.500
can kill a web three.

90
00:05:47.501 --> 00:05:50.830
I think we're supposed to call it web three because crypto is now an obsolescent

91
00:05:50.831 --> 00:05:52.390
term. They can't kill it,

92
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.680
but they can definitely make it difficult and throw a lot of sand into the

93
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.450
machine. And I think worst of all,

94
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.480
they can spoil the evolutionary story by,

95
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.790
by creating central bank digital currency that I don't think we really need, or

96
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.570
we certainly don't need it in the Chinese form.

97
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.600
<v 0>The, do you think Bitcoin has a strong chance to take over the world?</v>

98
00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:21.350
So become the primary.

99
00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:23.300
You mentioned the three things that make money,

100
00:06:23.301 --> 00:06:27.830
money that become the primary methodology by which we store

101
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:29.450
wealth. We exchange.

102
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.350
<v 1>No, no. I think what Bitcoin is,</v>

103
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.120
this was a phrase that I got from my friend, Matt McLennan, first Eagle,

104
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.320
an option on digital gold. So it's the gold of the system,

105
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.300
but currently it behaves like an option.

106
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.670
That's why it's quite volatile because we don't really know if this brave new

107
00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:54.440
world of crypto is going to work, but if it does work,

108
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.870
then Bitcoin's the gold because of the finite supply,

109
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.120
what role we need gold to play in the metaverse isn't quite

110
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:03.200
clear.

111
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.600
<v 0>I love that you're using the term metaverse this is great.</v>

112
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.440
<v 1>Well, I, I, I just liked the Metta Versity as a kind of, uh,</v>

113
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.630
as the antithesis of what we're trying to do and in Austin, but I love it.

114
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.610
Can you imagine I'm using it sarcastically?

115
00:07:16.611 --> 00:07:20.030
I come from Glasgow where all novel words have to be used sarcastically.

116
00:07:20.031 --> 00:07:21.830
So the metaverse sarcastic.

117
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:26.750
<v 0>The beauty about humor and sarcasm is that the joke becomes</v>

118
00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:28.160
reality. I mean,

119
00:07:28.161 --> 00:07:31.790
it's like using the word big bang to describe the origins of the universe.

120
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:32.653
It becomes like.

121
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.640
<v 1>It will, after a while it's in the textbooks and nobody's laughing. Yeah. Well,</v>

122
00:07:37.641 --> 00:07:41.990
that's exactly right. So sticky. Yeah. Um,

123
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.560
I'm on the side of humor, but it is, uh, it is a dangerous activity these days.

124
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.240
Anyway, I think Bitcoin is, is the option of digital gold. The,

125
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:55.640
the role it plays is probably not so much store volume right

126
00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:58.970
now. It's just nicely, not very correlated asset in your portfolio.

127
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.510
When I updated the sense of money, which was in 20 18,

128
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:06.380
10 years after it came out, I wrote a new chapter in which I said,

129
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:08.480
Bitcoin,

130
00:08:08.481 --> 00:08:13.070
which had just sold off after its 2017 bubble will rise

131
00:08:13.071 --> 00:08:17.780
again through adoption because if every millionaire in the world

132
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:22.130
has 0.2% of his or her wealth in Bitcoin,

133
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.170
the price should be $15,000.

134
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.970
If it's 1% it's $75,000 and it might not

135
00:08:28.971 --> 00:08:33.050
even stay at 1% because I mean, look at its recent performance. If you,

136
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:37.700
if your exposure to stop Scoble stocks had been hedged with a

137
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.550
significant, uh, crypto holding,

138
00:08:40.551 --> 00:08:44.570
you would have aced the last few months. Uh,

139
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.860
so I think the non-correlation property is very,

140
00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:51.500
very important in driving adoption.

141
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:55.950
And the volatility also drives adoption if you're a sophisticated investor. Uh,

142
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.110
so I think the adoption drives, uh, uh,

143
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.460
Bitcoin up because it's the option of digital gold,

144
00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:04.020
but it's also just this nicely,

145
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:08.730
not very correlated asset that you want to hold in in a world where the

146
00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:11.640
hell, I mean, the banks everybody's going to tighten,

147
00:09:11.641 --> 00:09:14.610
we've come through this massively disruptive episode of the pandemic,

148
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.660
public debt, sword, money printing sword.

149
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:24.600
You could hang around with your bonds and wait for the euthanasia of the wrong

150
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.230
TA. You can hang on to your tech stocks and just hope there isn't a massive

151
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:30.360
correction or dot.dot when,

152
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.230
and it seems like a fairly obvious strategy to make sure that you have at least

153
00:09:34.231 --> 00:09:39.150
some crypto for the coming year given what we likely

154
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:40.020
have to face.

155
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.610
I think what's really interesting is that on top of Ethereum,

156
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.380
a more elaborate financial system is being

157
00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:50.214
built.

158
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:56.250
Stable coins are the interesting puzzle for

159
00:09:56.251 --> 00:10:01.230
me because we need off-ramps ultimately you and I have to pay

160
00:10:01.231 --> 00:10:03.180
taxes in us dollars.

161
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:07.470
And there's no getting away from that.

162
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.570
The IRS is going to let us hold crypto as long as we pay our taxes.

163
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:17.250
And the only question in my mind is what's the optimal off-ramp

164
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.820
to make those taxes, make those tax payments.

165
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:25.830
Probably it shouldn't be a currency invented by Facebook.

166
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.340
Never struck me as the best solution to this problem.

167
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:33.960
Maybe it's some kind of fed coin, uh,

168
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:38.190
or maybe one of the existing algorithmic stable coins does the job,

169
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.830
but we clearly need some stable off ramp.

170
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.520
So you don't think as possible for the IRS within the next decade to be

171
00:10:44.521 --> 00:10:46.380
accepting Bitcoin as tax payments.

172
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:51.960
I doubt that having dealt with the IRS knows since when did I first come

173
00:10:51.961 --> 00:10:55.830
here 2002, it's hard to think of an institution,

174
00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:00.750
less likely to reap into the 21st century when it

175
00:11:00.751 --> 00:11:04.290
comes to payments. No, I think, I think will, we'll be,

176
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:06.090
we'll be tolerated.

177
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.740
Crypto world will be tolerated as long as we pay our taxes. That's the,

178
00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.900
and it's important that we're already at that point.

179
00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.420
And then the next question becomes well,

180
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.210
does Gary Gensler define everything as a security?

181
00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:22.980
And do we then have to go through endless regulatory contortions to

182
00:11:22.981 --> 00:11:26.160
satisfy the sec? There's a whole bunch of,

183
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:31.020
of uncertainties that the administrative state excels at creating because

184
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.900
that's just how that's how the administrative state works.

185
00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:38.280
You'll do something new. Hmm. I'll decide whether that's a security,

186
00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:42.390
but don't expect me to define it for you all decide in an arbitrary way and then

187
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.530
you'll owe me money. So all of this is going to be very annoying and, you know,

188
00:11:46.531 --> 00:11:50.730
for people who are trying to run, uh, exchanges or, uh,

189
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.800
innovate in the space, these, these regulations will be annoying.

190
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:57.520
But the problem with FinTech is it's, it's different from tech broadly defined,

191
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.300
you know, when tech got into e-commerce with Amazon,

192
00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:03.430
when it got into social networking with Facebook,

193
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.540
there wasn't a huge regulatory jungle to navigate,

194
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:09.850
but welcome to the world of finance,

195
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.560
which has always been a jungle of regulation because the regulation is,

196
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:19.450
is there to basically entrench the incumbents. That's what it's for.

197
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:24.520
So it'll be a much tougher fight than the fights we've.

198
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:25.780
We've seen of, uh,

199
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:30.190
other aspects of the tech revolution because the incumbents are,

200
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:34.690
are there and they see the threat. And in the end,

201
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.340
Satoshi said it very explicitly it's peer to peer payment with that third party

202
00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:43.570
verification and all the third part is going, wait, what were the third parties?

203
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:48.130
<v 0>So there is a connection between power and money.</v>

204
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.110
You've mentioned world war one from the perspective of money.

205
00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:56.080
So power, money,

206
00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:00.970
war authoritarian regimes from the perspective

207
00:13:00.971 --> 00:13:01.631
of money,

208
00:13:01.631 --> 00:13:06.100
do you have hope that cryptocurrency can help resist war

209
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:10.690
can help resist the negative effects of

210
00:13:10.691 --> 00:13:14.530
authoritarian regimes? Or is that a silly hope.

211
00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.630
<v 1>Wars happen?</v>

212
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:25.000
Because the people who have the power to command

213
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:29.400
armed forces, miscalculate,

214
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:31.470
that's generally what happens.

215
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:38.680
And we will have a big war in the near future if both the Chinese government and

216
00:13:38.681 --> 00:13:43.570
the U S government miscalculates and they unleash lethal lethal

217
00:13:43.571 --> 00:13:44.560
force on one another.

218
00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:48.730
And there's nothing that any financial institution can do to stop that

219
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:52.900
any more than the Ross cults could Rothschilds could stop world war one.

220
00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.980
And they were then the biggest bank in the world by far with massive

221
00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.230
international financial influence.

222
00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:03.490
So let's accept that war is isn't a different domain.

223
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:10.270
War would impact the financial world massively if it were a war

224
00:14:10.271 --> 00:14:11.890
between the United States and China,

225
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:16.330
because there's still a huge China trade on

226
00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:20.050
wall street as long China, Europe as long China.

227
00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.790
So the conflict that I could foresee in the future is one that's highly

228
00:14:24.791 --> 00:14:28.390
financially disruptive. Where does crypto fit in?

229
00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:35.140
Crypto's obvious utility in the short run is as a store

230
00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:39.910
of wealth of transferrable wealth for people who live in

231
00:14:39.911 --> 00:14:43.840
dangerous places with failing, not just failing money,

232
00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:47.050
but failing rule of law. That's why in Latin America,

233
00:14:47.051 --> 00:14:50.200
there's so much interest in crypto because Latin Americans have a lot of

234
00:14:50.201 --> 00:14:52.730
monetary history to look back on and not much of it is good.

235
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:59.060
So I think that the short run problem that crypto solves

236
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.810
is, and this goes back to the digital gold points.

237
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:07.330
If you are in a dangerous place with weak rule of law,

238
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:12.200
weak property rights here is a new and better way to

239
00:15:12.201 --> 00:15:13.430
have portable wealth.

240
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:20.060
I think the next question to ask is,

241
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:25.040
would you want to be long crypto in the events of world war three?

242
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.540
What's interesting about that question is that world war three would likely have

243
00:15:29.541 --> 00:15:31.640
a significant cyber dimension to it.

244
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:37.400
And I don't want to be a hundred percent in crypto if they crashed the internet,

245
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.990
which between them, China and Russia might be able to do.

246
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:43.940
<v 0>That's a fascinating question.</v>

247
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:49.150
Whether you want to be holding physical gold or digital gold in the event of

248
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:49.430
war.

249
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:53.990
<v 1>Or three, the smart person who studied history definitely wants better both.</v>

250
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:59.000
And so let's imagine world war three has a very,

251
00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:03.890
very severely cyber component to it with high levels of disruption. Yeah.

252
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:08.000
You'd be glad of the old field shiny stuff at that point.

253
00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:13.310
So diversification still seems like the most important

254
00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:18.350
truth of a financial history and what is crypto.

255
00:16:18.351 --> 00:16:21.020
It's just this wonderful new source of diversification,

256
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:25.480
but you'd be nuts to be a hundred percent in Bitcoin. I mean, I, I,

257
00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:29.570
I have some friends who are probably quite close to that close to a hundred

258
00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:34.490
percent Mar the, I admire the bowls of steel.
