00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.290
<v 0>When I read the, um, Kurzweil's book about the singularity,</v>

2
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.750
to me, it read just like, um, religious language, like it read, like,

3
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.370
you know, cause he, they,

4
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.200
in fact it's so much like revelation to me when I read it that I

5
00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:23.550
even assign it to my students in my classes. I'm like, this is, this is it.

6
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.970
You know, this is like a really great book of the singularity, you know,

7
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.930
the coming singularity and um, this religious event,

8
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.330
because it seems like it when he writes about it, he says,

9
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.350
I felt it before I even understood.

10
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.890
<v 1>No, he mean Kurzweil, Kurzweil. Yeah. Chris w I mean,</v>

11
00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:44.450
what are your feelings about feelings, thoughts, and feelings too,

12
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.140
about the, the idea of the singularity.

13
00:00:48.141 --> 00:00:51.470
Do you think it's ultimately the thing that echoes throughout the history of

14
00:00:51.471 --> 00:00:53.480
ideas is this, um,

15
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.910
like moment of revelation like this,

16
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.270
this almost mythological religious moment,

17
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.900
or is there something more

18
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.780
physical to this idea of concrete about the idea of,

19
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.740
um, they'll come a point where our technology there'll be like a phase shift

20
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.970
between, uh, um, the,

21
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:22.910
the basic fabric of like humanity, of how we interact, you know,

22
00:01:22.911 --> 00:01:25.970
how evolution brought us to be these biological interaction. They,

23
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.160
our technology, uh,

24
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.510
crosses some kind of line of capability that the world would be more

25
00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:37.490
technology than human to where it leaves us behind.

26
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.150
<v 0>Oh yeah. I don't think it's going to leave us behind.</v>

27
00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:42.680
I think it's going to take us along.

28
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.240
<v 1>But it will be, I mean, I guess they did the singularity, first of all,</v>

29
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.920
it isn't they do the singularity is like,

30
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.980
we can't possibly predict what's on the other side of the singularity.

31
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.151
These are the census.

32
00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:56.600
Like this is like the world will be fundamentally transformed.

33
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.230
<v 0>Yes. Okay. So right. And then it was, you know, um,</v>

34
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.880
this was characterized in various movies like Lucy and stuff like that. Uh,

35
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.650
you know, Lucy being the first human that right. We so kind of replicating,

36
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.360
this is going to be the next iteration of humans is the singularity. Um,

37
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.860
I actually don't believe that, um, frankly, however,

38
00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:22.970
and the reason I don't believe it is because we're material beings and

39
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.690
technology has to have a host, so we're not gonna, you know,

40
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.640
become something super abstract. Like there's, it's just an impossible to do.

41
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.630
There's nothing like that.

42
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.410
<v 1>What people will be listening to this podcast a hundred years from now and</v>

43
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:37.760
laughing at it because

44
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.120
they'll be all existing in a virtual reality will be all information, uh,

45
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.010
as opposed to material,

46
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.030
meaning connected to some kind of concept of physical,

47
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.350
uh, physical reality. I don't even know the right words to use here.

48
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.240
<v 0>See that's because there are none because there's no place from,</v>

49
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.160
there's no view from nowhere. There's no non material.

50
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.740
Like we have thoughts, but they're connected to us right there in our, you know,

51
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.240
they're somehow okay.

52
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.520
<v 1>As far as, uh, as far as, you know.</v>

53
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.500
<v 0>Listen, platonic forms I think is about, is, is, you know,</v>

54
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.830
close to what we're talking about is possible.

55
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.170
Like this place where these things exist.

56
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.010
And then there's like a physical instantiation of it.

57
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.760
<v 1>Uh, the question is from the perspective of the platonic form,</v>

58
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.140
what does our physical world look like? You know what I'm saying? Like, um,

59
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.650
you know, if, if, if say you're a creature existing in a virtual reality,

60
00:03:40.651 --> 00:03:45.270
like if you grew up your whole life in a

61
00:03:45.271 --> 00:03:48.120
virtual reality game, like,

62
00:03:48.121 --> 00:03:52.770
what is it in somebody in that virtual reality world tells you that there

63
00:03:52.771 --> 00:03:56.640
actually exists this physical world. And in fact,

64
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.590
your own, you think you're in this virtual world, but it's actually,

65
00:04:01.591 --> 00:04:04.740
you're in a body and this is just your mind putting yourself.

66
00:04:04.741 --> 00:04:07.890
And there's a piece of technology, like how will they,

67
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.670
how will they be able to think of the physical world? Would they,

68
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.900
would they sound exactly like, you just sounded a minute ago saying like, well,

69
00:04:15.901 --> 00:04:20.490
that's silly who cares if there's a physical world, it's the,

70
00:04:20.491 --> 00:04:25.380
the entirety of the perception and my memories

71
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.360
and all of that is in this other realm of, um,

72
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.290
of like information. It's just all just information. I,

73
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.340
why do I need some kind of weird meat bag to contain?

74
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.490
<v 0>There's a great again, I was re you know,</v>

75
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.630
returned to something for your audience to read or you, um, there's a great,

76
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.610
very short article online for free by David Chalmers. Do you know him?

77
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.500
He's the philosopher of consciousness.

78
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.780
<v 1>On this podcast. Yeah, yeah.</v>

79
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.620
<v 0>Yeah. He's cool. Um, I used to,</v>

80
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.340
I was friends with his best friend for a while. When, when I was in grad school.

81
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.680
<v 1>He probably has some weird friends.</v>

82
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.080
<v 0>Philosopher. Okay. So, um.</v>

83
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.130
<v 1>I like his fashion choice in hairstyle to hang out with him,</v>

84
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.510
but he's a great guy.

85
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.400
<v 0>Okay. So he wrote this article, which I use a lot.</v>

86
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.200
I love it because it's accessible to undergraduates and it's called matrix as

87
00:05:25.201 --> 00:05:27.630
metaphysics. And basically it's,

88
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.660
it's an answer to external world skepticism,

89
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.320
which is basically how do we know there's an external world, right?

90
00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:37.830
How do we know that we're not in a matrix right now? And so, um,

91
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.490
basically he's using he's, he's also,

92
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.840
he even references, he uses a religious reference, even he says,

93
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:47.970
you can think of the matrix,

94
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.920
the movie as a new, as the new, um,

95
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.890
book of Genesis for our new world. Right. And I thought, yeah,

96
00:05:57.891 --> 00:06:02.000
that's absolutely correct. Because, you know, we don't know.

97
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.410
And we don't, we won't know for sure. Or for certain,

98
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.770
therefore what we know is what is real to us.

99
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.600
And so he goes through these scenarios and within philosophy is called,

100
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:18.200
there's a, it, this is different from that, but it's like this brain in a VAT,

101
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.360
right. If you're a brain in a VAT and some not so kind scientist is like

102
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.210
recreating this world for you, just to see, you know,

103
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.450
and you think you're this awesome rockstar. Right.

104
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.810
And you're living this awesome existence per actually just this brain in this

105
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:36.470
VAT. Okay. But there's still a brain in a VAT. Okay.

106
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.040
So his idea in, um, the matrix says,

107
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:43.150
metaphysics kind of takes out the brain in a VAT like this.

108
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.830
I don't know if this is possible. So I've read critiques of this, that,

109
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.700
you know, what you're talking about is a non-dualism like, there's like, um,

110
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.590
you know, or it's not necessarily a non-dualism.

111
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.280
Um, I just, I mean,

112
00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:06.260
information in and of itself has to have some

113
00:07:06.261 --> 00:07:07.580
kind of material components.

114
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.200
<v 1>I mean, I it's that, that, that, uh,</v>

115
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.510
when taking it outside of the realm of human beings,

116
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.510
cause dualisms kind of talking about humans. Yeah.

117
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.730
In a sense it's just possible to me that there could be creatures that exist

118
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.310
in a very different form,

119
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.750
perhaps rely on very different set of materials that,

120
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.520
that may or may perhaps not even look like materials to us. Yes.

121
00:07:33.521 --> 00:07:37.810
I agree. Which is why like information, it could be,

122
00:07:37.811 --> 00:07:39.340
even in computers,

123
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.980
that information that's traveling inside a computer is

124
00:07:44.981 --> 00:07:49.960
connected to actual, um, material movement.

125
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.190
Right. Right. So like there is, it is ultimately connected to mature movement,

126
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:58.330
but it's less and less about the material and more and more about the

127
00:07:58.331 --> 00:08:02.740
information. So I just mean that there's, it's possible that, uh.

128
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:08.080
<v 0>Clarity is basically like sloughing off our material existence</v>

129
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.690
because I can tell you that this has been the hope philosophers and theologians

130
00:08:13.691 --> 00:08:14.524
forever.

131
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.820
<v 1>Yeah. Well, I don't, I think we're living in a sing, uh, through a singularity.</v>

132
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:23.710
I don't think, I think this world just, just like, as you said already,

133
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:28.360
um, has been already transformed significantly and it keeps continually being

134
00:08:28.361 --> 00:08:31.270
transformed and we're just riding this big,

135
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:35.100
beautiful wave of transformation. And, uh,

136
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:40.600
that's why it's both exciting and terrifying, uh,

137
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:45.370
from a scientific perspective that like we're so bad at predicting the

138
00:08:45.371 --> 00:08:50.260
future and the future is always so amazing in terms of the

139
00:08:50.261 --> 00:08:52.390
things that has brought us. I mean,

140
00:08:52.391 --> 00:08:56.550
I don't know if it's always will be this exciting terms of the rate of

141
00:08:56.551 --> 00:09:00.720
innovation, but it seems to be increasing still as really exciting.

142
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.030
<v 2>Yeah. It's terrifying because.</v>

143
00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.460
<v 1>Obviously we're building better and better tools for destroying ourselves.</v>

144
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.400
But I, on the optimistic side,

145
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:15.680
believed that we're also can build better and better tools to defend against

146
00:09:15.681 --> 00:09:17.300
all the ways we can destroy ourselves.

147
00:09:17.301 --> 00:09:20.540
And it's kind of this interesting race of innovation.
