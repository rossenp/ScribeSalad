1
00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.700
<v 0>This is a defeat. I mean, I think there should be accountability. And if you,</v>

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.260
and this could be a kind of opening for a kind of bipartisan conversation,

3
00:00:09.261 --> 00:00:13.620
because if you are a kind of, um, American mil,

4
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:14.821
I mean,

5
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:18.340
you have to look at the leadership that got you to a place where you were

6
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.900
defeated by men wearing sandals, firing a K 47,

7
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.960
right?

8
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.130
<v 1>Yeah. There should be a humility with that. Like the, I mean, yeah,</v>

9
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.850
we should actually say that we like literally.

10
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.930
<v 0>The, oh, we lost you say, you say we lost it. Wasn't just, you know, um.</v>

11
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.450
<v 1>The American military lost.</v>

12
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.370
<v 0>Yeah. And I, and I, and I feel I have very mixed feelings and, you know, it's,</v>

13
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.520
I don't know a ton of veterans, but you know, I've mentioned,

14
00:00:45.521 --> 00:00:48.720
I've taught my share and, um, have a student now and, you know,

15
00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:52.080
they are they're suffering because they look at the sacrifices that they made

16
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.360
that I didn't make. I mean, American society to make the sacrifices. I mean,

17
00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.480
men and women lost limbs, they lost eyes, they lost lives, you know, uh,

18
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.590
there's been this of course, quiet epidemic of suicide among,

19
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.830
among veterans. And I I've heard some stories.

20
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.030
The fact that the state department is seeing a similar surge of suicides cuz

21
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.670
they see their adult lives, work collapse. They've seen their relationships.

22
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.583
I mean, they've seen,

23
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.710
they've seeing phone calls in the middle of the night from people who they

24
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.580
entrusted with their lives, who, who they know are gonna be targeted. I mean,

25
00:01:26.581 --> 00:01:29.780
some have already been killed. Um, they've seen the, I,

26
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.020
I mean I think just I'd imagine just ideologically and professionally what they

27
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:38.860
believed in and what they, what they sacrificed for, you know, has vanished.

28
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.860
Yeah. And I think that's a, that's that's bad. I mean,

29
00:01:42.861 --> 00:01:45.490
historically thinking of some of the precedents you were know, I mean,

30
00:01:45.491 --> 00:01:49.050
if you think of, you know, first of all, you know, at a human level,

31
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.250
I feel horrible for those people who, you know,

32
00:01:51.251 --> 00:01:54.650
I may not have agreed with everything they had done and their choices in life,

33
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.530
but I respect the fact that many good people went out of, you know,

34
00:01:59.531 --> 00:02:02.130
the best intentions as young people to, to,

35
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.810
to do the right thing and made things right.

36
00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:08.240
And I respect that and I've met enough to know that there were people who

37
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.680
saw the gray in complexity and that that's, you know, all you can hope for. Um,

38
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.800
but we don't want a generation of disillusion veterans. Um, you know,

39
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.480
if we look at the other post-war moments and this is kind of a post-war moment

40
00:02:22.481 --> 00:02:25.840
where, you know, I think we need a conversation with American veterans about,

41
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.390
about what they've gone through and what they're feeling and they have,

42
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.950
they still have skin in the game, you know,

43
00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:33.830
because their personal connections and their in of their histories, they're.

44
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.110
<v 1>Also gonna be future leaders. I mean, uh, veterans already. Yeah.</v>

45
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.790
People who have served are often great men and women that's, that's true.

46
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.980
And, you know, throughout history,

47
00:02:47.981 --> 00:02:49.700
whether you sacrifice,

48
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.300
you served in fighting world war II in fighting Vietnam,

49
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.740
that's going to mold you in different ways that those that's going to mold

50
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.400
how you are as a leader that leads this country forward. And, uh,

51
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.040
so you have to have an honest conversation about, um, what was, um,

52
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.760
the role of the war of Afghanistan, the war in the middle east,

53
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.880
the war on terror in the history of America.

54
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.070
If we just look at the full context at the end end of this 21st century,

55
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.830
how are we're going to remember this and how that's going to result in our

56
00:03:24.831 --> 00:03:29.790
future interactions with small and large countries with China or some

57
00:03:29.791 --> 00:03:34.150
proxy war with China, with Russia, or some proxy war with, uh, Russia,

58
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.990
what's the role of oil and natural resources and opium and all those kinds of

59
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:42.980
things. What's role of military power. Yeah. Uh, in the world.

60
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.900
And now with COVID, you know, it it's like, um,

61
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.060
it's almost like the,

62
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.460
because of the many failures of us government, uh,

63
00:03:55.461 --> 00:03:59.380
and many leaders, uh, in, in science,

64
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.730
some politics to respond effectively and quickly to, uh,

65
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.330
to COVID we kind of forget that we fumbled this other thing too.

66
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.330
Yeah. And it's, it's hard to know which is going to be more expensive. Yeah. Uh,

67
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.250
but they, they seem to be symptoms of something of,

68
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.240
of the, a same kind of source problem, um,

69
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.480
of leadership of bureaucracy, of, of, uh,

70
00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:32.480
the way information and intelligence flows throughout the us government,

71
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.760
all those kinds of things. Yeah.

72
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:36.520
And that hopefully motivates young leaders to fix things right.
