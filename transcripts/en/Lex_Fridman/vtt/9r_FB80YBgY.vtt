00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.870
<v 0>From the branching perspective. You mentioned regrets. Uh,</v>

2
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.590
do you have regrets about your own trajectory?

3
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.990
<v 1>Oh yeah, of course. Yeah. Some of it's painful,</v>

4
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.950
but you wanna hear the painful stuff? &lt;laugh&gt;, I'd say like,

5
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.380
in terms of working with people, when people did say stuff, I did like,

6
00:00:23.381 --> 00:00:25.020
especially if it was a bit nefarious,

7
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.740
I took it personally and I also felt it was personal about them,

8
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.580
but a lot of times like humans are, you know, most humans are a mess. Right.

9
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.660
And then they act out and they do stuff. And I, this psychologist, I,

10
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.180
I heard a long time ago said you tend to think somebody does something to you.

11
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.950
Hmm.

12
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.890
But really what they're doing is they're doing what they're doing while they're

13
00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:50.810
in front of you. It's not that much about you. Yeah. Right.

14
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.410
And as I got more interested in, you know,

15
00:00:55.411 --> 00:00:56.250
when I work with people,

16
00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.130
I think about them and I probably analyze them and understand them a little bit.

17
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.600
And then when they do stuff, I'm way less surprised. And I, you know,

18
00:01:04.601 --> 00:01:08.120
and if it's bad, I'm way less hurt. And I react way less.

19
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.160
Like I sort of expect everybody's got their. Yeah.

20
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.180
<v 0>And it's not about.</v>

21
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.320
<v 1>You as much. It's not about me that much. It's like, you know,</v>

22
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.160
you do something and you think you're embarrassed, but nobody cares. Like,

23
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.560
and somebody's really mad at you. The odds of it being about you,

24
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.350
they're getting mad the way they're doing that because of some pattern they

25
00:01:27.351 --> 00:01:31.470
learned and, you know, and maybe you can help 'em if you care enough about it,

26
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.550
but, or you could step, you could see it coming and step out of the way. Like,

27
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.630
like I wish I was way better at that. I I'm a bit of a hothead.

28
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.950
And you read that, you.

29
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.830
<v 0>Said with Steve, that was a feature, not a bug. Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.620
<v 1>Well, he was using it at, as the counter for, uh,</v>

31
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.140
orderliness that would crush his work. Well, you were doing the same, eh,

32
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.580
maybe I don't think, I, I don't think my, uh, my vision was big enough.

33
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.020
It was more like, I just got off and, and did stuff. &lt;laugh&gt;.

34
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.260
<v 0>I'm sure that's the, yeah. You're, you're.</v>

35
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.860
<v 1>Telling, I don't know if it had the, it,</v>

36
00:02:03.861 --> 00:02:07.050
it didn't have the amazing effect that creating the trillion dollar company,

37
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.330
it was more like, I just got off and left and,

38
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.450
or made enemies that he shouldn't have. And, you know, it's, it's hard. Like,

39
00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:19.090
I didn't really understand politics until I worked at apple where, you know,

40
00:02:19.091 --> 00:02:22.290
Steve was a master player of politics and his staff had to be,

41
00:02:22.291 --> 00:02:25.610
or they wouldn't survive him. And it was definitely part of the culture.

42
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.640
And then I've been companies where they say it's political, but it's all,

43
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.080
you know, fun and games compared to apple.

44
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.440
And it's not that that the people at apple are bad people. It's just,

45
00:02:35.441 --> 00:02:40.280
they operate it politically at a, at a higher level. You know, it's not like,

46
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.120
oh, somebody said something bad about somebody, somebody else,

47
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.110
which is most politics. It's, you know, they,

48
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.470
they had strategies about accomplishing their goals sometimes, you know,

49
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.910
over the dead bodies of their enemies. &lt;laugh&gt;, you know, with sophistication.

50
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.820
Yeah.

51
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.160
More game of Thrones and sophistication and like a big time factor rather than

52
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.480
a, you know, well, that requires.

53
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.480
<v 0>A lot of control over your emotions, I think, uh, to, to,</v>

54
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.160
to have a bigger strategy in the way you behave.

55
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.560
<v 1>Yeah. And it's, it's,</v>

56
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.040
it's effective in the sense that coordinating thousands of people to do really

57
00:03:16.041 --> 00:03:18.440
hard things where many of the,

58
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.150
the people in there don't understand themselves much less,

59
00:03:21.151 --> 00:03:25.830
how they're participating yeah. Creates all kinds of, you know,

60
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.990
drama and problems that, you know, are solution is political in nature.

61
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.750
Like how do you convince people? How do you leverage 'em?

62
00:03:32.751 --> 00:03:35.510
How do you motivate 'em? How do you get rid of 'em? How do you know? Like,

63
00:03:35.511 --> 00:03:38.270
there's, there's so many layers of that that are interesting.

64
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.340
And even though some, some of it let's say may be tough. Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;,

65
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.940
it's not, uh, evil, unless, you know,

66
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.380
you use that skill to evil purposes, which some people obviously do, but,

67
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.780
but it's a skillset that operates, you know, and I wish I'd, you know,

68
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.220
I was interested in it, but I, you know, it was sort of like, I'm an,

69
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.690
I do my thing. And, you know, there's,

70
00:04:02.691 --> 00:04:06.970
there's times when I could have had way bigger impact, if I, you know,

71
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:10.330
knew how to, if I paid more attention and knew more about that,

72
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.690
about the human layer of the stack. Yeah. That the human political power,

73
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.610
you know, expression layer of the stack, which is complicated.

74
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.080
And there's lots to know about it. I mean,

75
00:04:21.081 --> 00:04:25.280
people are good at it are just amazing. And when they're good at it,

76
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.360
and let's say relatively kind and oriented in a

77
00:04:30.361 --> 00:04:32.280
good direction, you can really feel,

78
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.240
you can get lots of stuff done and coordinate things you never thought possible,

79
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.110
but all people like that also have so in pretty hard edges, cuz you know, it's,

80
00:04:43.111 --> 00:04:46.590
it's a heavy lift and I wish I'd spent more time at that when I was younger.

81
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.070
But, but maybe I wasn't ready. You know, I was a YD kid for 30 years.

82
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.950
It's a little bit of a kid. I know.
