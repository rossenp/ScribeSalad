00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.760
<v 0>Rumi the 13th century Persian poet who was born on the land that is now</v>

2
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:08.623
Afghanistan.

3
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.160
Is there something in his words that speaks to you about the spirit of the

4
00:00:13.161 --> 00:00:13.994
Afghan people?

5
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.780
<v 1>I mean, everyone owns Rumi, I guess I'd say,</v>

6
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.980
I mean that that's gonna get me in trouble with certain Afghan fans of Rumi who

7
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.490
wanna see him as, as Afghan, I would say. Are.

8
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.130
<v 0>They proud of, of RO? Yeah. Do they see him as a.</v>

9
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.290
<v 1>Afghan? Do they? Yeah. I mean, some it, again, it depends. I mean, some,</v>

10
00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:34.810
some people will be militant and say, you know,

11
00:00:34.811 --> 00:00:39.410
the audience can have him he's ours. Um, but they're also say, you know, he's,

12
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.010
I mean, you can say again, he's like a RO shock blo. I mean, he's, he's a Sufi,

13
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.520
he's a Muslim, he's a central Asian mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, he's Iranian,

14
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.880
he's AF he's a Turk. I'm trying to think of the analogy, but he's,

15
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.360
he's something special to everyone. So I guess I would,

16
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.400
I would not walk into that conversation and claim that he's one or another, but,

17
00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.600
but it's a cool thing. I mean, it's the, um,

18
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.440
but I'm glad you brought that up cause that's a good way of seeing a seeing.

19
00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:07.630
So the Afghans, I mean, we live in our to AF Afghanistan say, okay,

20
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.070
Rus everyone, you know, Madonna helped make a famous in the United States,

21
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.711
you know, for better,

22
00:01:11.711 --> 00:01:14.270
for worse mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; they used to sell stuff at Starbucks and that's

23
00:01:14.271 --> 00:01:17.310
all complicated. Um, and embarrassing and his,

24
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.950
his translations are very much disputed where you have people be like,

25
00:01:20.951 --> 00:01:22.990
there's some awful roomy translations. And there are,

26
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.740
there're also a lot of speaking of the internet, there are lots of, uh,

27
00:01:26.741 --> 00:01:30.220
fake roomy quotes. Yes. You know, like roomy said always be your best.

28
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.580
Didn't say that, that, you know, that was, you know, I mean,

29
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.020
that's kinda slow stuff like that, but yeah, but the cool thing is like the, um,

30
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.620
I mean, I think you can read Rumi as a religious thinker, but you can also,

31
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.170
you know, read Rumi as a, um, you know, and in this Islamic sense,

32
00:01:46.171 --> 00:01:48.810
but you can also read 'em as a kind of spiritualist, right. As someone who, or,

33
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.770
or an ethicist or moralist. And so I think that's, I like the,

34
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.410
the lens of roomi as a, a gateway to Afghan, um, AISM and cosmopolitanism,

35
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.530
you know, the, I keep izing of, of meeting actual Afghans who are actually,

36
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.360
you know, fluent and Russian fluent and German, fluent Turkish, they know Dari,

37
00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:13.720
they know Poto, um, they've gone to university or sometimes they haven't.

38
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.240
And yet, I mean, they're, um, I like the category of the, uh,

39
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.120
popular intellectual, you know, the intellectual who isn't,

40
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.200
isn't formally educated necessarily. Although of course that's represented too,

41
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:28.030
especially increasingly now with this and of going to university all over the

42
00:02:28.031 --> 00:02:32.310
world, you know, Stanford, MIT, everywhere. Um, Africans are war reps are there,

43
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.963
but just being,

44
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.150
I don't have any kind of worldly knowledge that is not limited to a province to

45
00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:44.070
a village, to a Hamlet, but sometimes it is, but sometimes it's not because of,

46
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.220
again, not because of some fairytale story of curiosity,

47
00:02:49.221 --> 00:02:54.220
wanting the globe out of, you know, some sense of, of privilege,

48
00:02:54.221 --> 00:02:57.780
but out of necessity, outta survival of, of having to adapt. And it's really,

49
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.040
um, extraordinary that, I mean, also you think about like professions, like,

50
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.320
you know, ask, ask Afghan, you know,

51
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.920
what does he or she do for a living and what have they done in the past? I mean,

52
00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:13.800
the answer is one gets shoe salesman, task up drivers, uh,

53
00:03:13.801 --> 00:03:15.200
surgeons all in one guy.

54
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.000
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. I.</v>

55
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.430
<v 1>Mean that, I mean, that's not just AFG in, but that's, you know,</v>

56
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:20.750
that that's very common, but.

57
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.910
<v 0>It's also, Russia is the same that's right.</v>

58
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.910
I think it's whenever there's complexities to the economic system and then

59
00:03:26.911 --> 00:03:27.670
that's right.

60
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.910
A short term and the long term history of how the country develops and is

61
00:03:31.911 --> 00:03:36.790
basically the people figuring out their way around a mess of a country

62
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.180
politically. Yeah. But a, uh,

63
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.500
beautiful flourishing culture and a humanity. Yeah. And that,

64
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:49.020
that creates super interesting people. Yeah. Yeah. So we can often see, okay,

65
00:03:49.021 --> 00:03:53.380
there's Taliban, there's war, there's, uh, economic malfunction.

66
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.380
There's harboring of terrorists, there's opium trade, all that kind of stuff.

67
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.450
But there's humans there with deep into intellectual lies. Uh,

68
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.410
and, uh, like I love the movie love crimes and the same kind of, uh,

69
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.410
hopes, fears, and desire to love the, the old Romeo and Juliet story.

70
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.570
And I think roomy to me represents that

71
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.490
the wit the intelligence,

72
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.880
but also the just eloquent and just beautiful

73
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.200
representation of humanity, of love. Some of the,

74
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.880
some of the best quotes about love from him, half of them fake, right.

75
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.120
&lt;laugh&gt; half them real, but the best ones are real. Right.

76
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.920
The best ones are real. Yeah. The best ones are real. Uh, Robert,

77
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.200
this was an incredible conversation. Oh, thank you for having it.

78
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.150
Thank you for the tour of Afghanistan

79
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.990
and making me, making us realize that, um,

80
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.110
there's much more to this country than, um,

81
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.230
what we may think it's a,

82
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.750
it's a beautiful country and it's full of beautiful people.

83
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.710
<v 1>You made me think about a lot of new things too. So it was definitely,</v>

84
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.980
definitely great for all my end too. So thank you so much.
