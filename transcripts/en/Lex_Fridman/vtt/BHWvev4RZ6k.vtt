00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.330
<v 0>Is there advice you would give to a young person today that looks up to the</v>

2
00:00:07.331 --> 00:00:09.530
stars and wonders what the heck they wanna do with their life.

3
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.250
So career science, life in general,

4
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.530
you've, uh, for now chosen a certain kind of path of curiosity.

5
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.650
What, uh, what insights do you draw from that,

6
00:00:21.651 --> 00:00:22.890
that you can give us advice to other?

7
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.800
<v 1>I think for somebody, I,</v>

8
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.440
I would not presume to speak to giving people advice on,

9
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.080
on life and humanity overall, but for somebody thinking of

10
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.800
being a scientist. So there are a couple of things,

11
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.510
one sort of practical thing, which is a career wise.

12
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.510
I hadn't appreciated this going into science, but you need to,

13
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.071
so the,

14
00:00:51.071 --> 00:00:55.790
the questions you're working on and the techniques you use are both

15
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.070
of very high importance, maybe equal importance for being happy in your career.

16
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.260
Um, if there are questions you're interested in and,

17
00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:09.020
but the techniques that you need to use to do them are tedious for you.

18
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.100
Then your job is gonna be miserable, even if the questions are inspiring.

19
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.260
So you have to find,

20
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.060
but if the techniques that you use are things that excite you,

21
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.660
then your job is fun every day.

22
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.490
<v 2>So for me, I'm fascinated by the solar system and I love telescopes,</v>

23
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.650
and I love doing data analysis, playing with data from telescopes,

24
00:01:28.651 --> 00:01:30.330
coming up with new ways to use telescopes.

25
00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:34.290
And so that's where I have found that mesh. But if I was interested in,

26
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.250
you know, the dynamical evolution of the solar system,

27
00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:38.490
how the orbits of things evolve,

28
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.410
then I would need to do a different type of work that I would just not find as

29
00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:45.920
appealing. And so it just wouldn't be a good fit. And so it sort of is,

30
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.080
seems like an unromantic thing to have to think about the techniques being the

31
00:01:50.081 --> 00:01:54.080
thing you wanna work on also, but it really makes a profound difference for,

32
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.320
I think, your happiness in your scientific.

33
00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.360
<v 0>Career. I think that's really profound. It's like the thing, the menial tasks,</v>

34
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.680
if you enjoy those, that's really good sign that that's the right path for you.

35
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.990
I think David at foster Wallace said that, uh, the key to life is to be unable.

36
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.670
Like so BA basically everything should be exciting.

37
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.830
I don't think that's feasible,

38
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.070
but you should find an area where everything is exciting. I mean,

39
00:02:20.071 --> 00:02:23.350
depending on the day, but you could find the joy in everything,

40
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.700
not just the big, exciting about things that everyone thinks is exciting,

41
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.940
but the, the details, the,

42
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.220
the repetitive stuff, the me stuff, the stuff that takes years,

43
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.780
the stuff that involves a lot of failure and all those kinds of things that you

44
00:02:38.781 --> 00:02:42.060
find that enjoyable. That's, that's actually really profound to focus on that.

45
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.700
Uh,

46
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.490
cuz people talk about like dreams and passion and goals and so on the big thing,

47
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.530
but that's not actually what takes you there? It takes you.

48
00:02:49.531 --> 00:02:54.490
There is every single day putting in the hours and that's what actually makes up

49
00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:57.850
life is the boring bits. And if the boring bits aren't boring,

50
00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.760
then that's an exciting life.
