00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.900
<v 0>How do you Intuit the 10 dimensional world? So,</v>

2
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.940
yes, it's a feature for describing certain phenomena, like the,

3
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.620
the entropy black holes, but what, um,

4
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.620
you said that to you, a theory becomes

5
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.090
real or becomes powerful when you can connect it to some deep intuition.

6
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.930
So how do we Intuit? Yes. 10 dimensions. Yes.

7
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.450
<v 1>Um, so I will, I will explain how, how some of the analogies work. First of all,</v>

8
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.410
we do a lot of analogies and by analogies, we build intuition.

9
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.810
So I would, I would start with this example.

10
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.480
I would try to explain that if we are in I 10 dimensional space,

11
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.720
if we have a seven dimensional plane and eight dimensional plane,

12
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.600
we ask typically, in what space do they intersect each other?

13
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.760
In what dimension that might sound like,

14
00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.280
how do you possibly give an answer to this? So we start with lower dimensions.

15
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.920
We start with two dimensions. We say,

16
00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:06.670
if you have one dimension and if point do they intersect typically on a plane,

17
00:01:06.671 --> 00:01:08.510
the answer is no. So a line,

18
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.990
one dimensional a 0.0 dimension on a two dimensional plane.

19
00:01:11.991 --> 00:01:13.710
They don't typically meet mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

20
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.430
But if you have a one dimensional line, another line,

21
00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:20.710
which is one plus one on a plane, they typically intersect at a point.

22
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.910
Typically means if you are not parallel,

23
00:01:22.911 --> 00:01:26.580
typically they intersect at a &lt;affirmative&gt;. So one plus one is two.

24
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.580
And in two dimension, they intersect at a zero dimensional point.

25
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.940
So you see two dimension, one and 1, 2, 2 minus two is zero.

26
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.020
So you get point out of intersection. Okay, let's go to three dimension.

27
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.540
You have a plane, two dimensional plane, and a point do they intersect?

28
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.410
No two and zero. How about the plane and a line?

29
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.490
A plane is two dimensional and a line is one,

30
00:01:49.491 --> 00:01:51.970
two plus one is three in three dimension,

31
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.970
a plane and a line meet at points, which is zero dimensional.

32
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.130
Three minus three is zero mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. Okay,

33
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.010
so plane and a line intersect at a point in three dimension.

34
00:02:02.011 --> 00:02:04.850
How about the plane and a plane in 3d? A plane is two,

35
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.120
and this is two plus two is four in 3d. Four minus three is one.

36
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.480
They intersect on a one dimension line. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; okay.

37
00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:13.680
We're beginning to say pattern. Okay. Now come to question.

38
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.160
We're in 10 dimensions. Now we have the intuition, right?

39
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.240
We have a seven dimensional plane and eight dimensional plane in 10 dimension.

40
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.920
They intersect on a plane. What's the dimension. What? Seven plus eight,

41
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.030
50 minus 10 is five. We draw the same P picture as two planes,

42
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.390
and we write seven dimension, eight dimension,

43
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.350
but we have gotten the intuition from the lower dimensional one,

44
00:02:33.351 --> 00:02:37.750
what to expect it doesn't scare us anymore. So we draw this picture.

45
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.510
We cannot see all the seven dimensions by looking at this two dimensional

46
00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:46.820
visualization of it, but it has all the features we want. It has.

47
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.420
So we draw this picture, which is seven, seven, and then they,

48
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.260
they meet at a five dimensional plane, which is five. So we have,

49
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.940
we have built this intuition. Now

50
00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.640
this is an example of how we come up with intuition.

51
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.360
Let me give you more examples of it,

52
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:05.200
because I think this will show you that people have to come up with intuitions

53
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.320
to visualize that otherwise we will, we'll be a little bit, uh, lost. So what.

54
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.160
<v 0>You just describe is kind of, uh, in these high dimensional spaces,</v>

55
00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.680
focus on the meeting place of, uh,

56
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.880
two planes and high dimensional spaces.

57
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.230
<v 1>How the planes meet, for example,</v>

58
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:22.870
what's the dimension of their intersection and so on.

59
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:24.910
So how do we come up with intuition? We,

60
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.590
we borrow examples from door dimensions,

61
00:03:27.591 --> 00:03:32.150
build up intuition and draw the same pictures as if we are talking about, uh,

62
00:03:32.151 --> 00:03:34.910
10 dimensions, but we are drawing the same as of two dimensional plane,

63
00:03:34.911 --> 00:03:38.750
because we cannot do any better, but our, our, our words change,

64
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.900
but not our pictures. So.

65
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.620
<v 0>Your sense is we can have a deep understanding of reality by looking at its</v>

66
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.580
at its slices, a lower dimensional slices.

67
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.940
<v 1>Exactly. Exactly. And this, this is comes,</v>

68
00:03:50.941 --> 00:03:53.940
brings me to the next example I wanna mention, which is fear.

69
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.740
Let's think about how do we think about this fear? Well, this fear is this fear,

70
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.490
you know, the round nice thing, but sphere has a circular symmetry.

71
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.970
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. Now I can describe the sphere in the following way.

72
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.050
I can describe it by an interval, which is,

73
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.650
think about this going from the north of the sphere to the south.

74
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.810
And at each point I have a circle attached to it.

75
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.240
So you can think about the sphere as a line with a circle attached with each

76
00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:23.880
point, the circle shrinks to the circle,

77
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.040
shrinks to a point at end points of the interval. So I can say, oh,

78
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.480
one way to think about this fear is an interval where at each point

79
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.000
on that interval, there's another circle. I'm not drawing, but if you like,

80
00:04:36.001 --> 00:04:40.000
you can just draw it, say, okay, I won't draw it. So from now on, this is Ponic.

81
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.710
I draw an interval when I wanna talk about this sphere.

82
00:04:42.711 --> 00:04:46.310
And you remember that the end points of the interval mean a strong circle.

83
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.150
That's all. And they say, yeah, I see that's a sphere. Good.

84
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.310
Now we wanna talk about the product of two spheres. That's four dimensional.

85
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.510
How can I visualize it? &lt;laugh&gt; easy. You just take an interval and it,

86
00:04:57.511 --> 00:05:00.550
another interval. That's just gonna be a square. Yeah.

87
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.980
A square is a four dimensional space. Yeah. Why is that? Well,

88
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.220
at each point on the square, there's two circles.

89
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.860
One for each of those directions you drew.

90
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.140
And when you get to the boundaries of each direction,

91
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.780
one of the circle shrink on each edge of that square mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

92
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.020
And when you get to the corners of the square, all, both circle shrink.

93
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.890
This is a sphere times of sphere. I have divine interval.

94
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.730
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I just described for you a four dimensional space.

95
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.250
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; do you want the six dimensional space? No problem.

96
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.410
Take the, take a corner of a room. In fact, if you want to have a sphere times,

97
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:36.770
just take, take sphere. Times of sphere,

98
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.890
times sphere mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; take a cube.

99
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.160
A cube is a rendition of this six dimensional space.

100
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.520
Two sphere, times another sphere times under sphere were three of the circles.

101
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.720
I'm not drawing for you for each one of those direction. There's another circle.

102
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.880
But each time you get to the boundary of the cube, one circle shrinks.

103
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.840
When the boundaries meet two circle strings,

104
00:05:56.841 --> 00:05:59.680
when three boundaries meet all the three circle shrink.

105
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.240
So I just give you a picture. Now, mathematics come up with amazing things like,

106
00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.720
you know what? I wanna take your point in space and blow it up. You know,

107
00:06:07.721 --> 00:06:11.080
these concepts like topology and geometry complicated. How do you do?

108
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.160
And this picture's very easy. Blow it up in this picture means the following.

109
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:16.950
You think this cube,

110
00:06:16.951 --> 00:06:21.630
you go to the corner and you chop off a corner chopping off the corner.

111
00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:25.470
Replaces the point. Yeah. You raise a point by a triangle. Yes.

112
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.870
That's called blowing up a point.

113
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.910
And then this triangle is what they call P two projective, two space.

114
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.950
But these pictures are very physical and you feel it. There's nothing amazing.

115
00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.260
I'm not talking about six dimension, four plus six is 10,

116
00:06:37.261 --> 00:06:40.020
the dimensional strength theory. So we can visualize that. No problem.
