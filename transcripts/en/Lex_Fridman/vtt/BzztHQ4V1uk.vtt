00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.370
<v 0>But at the same time, you've said that quote,</v>

2
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.130
I don't believe there's pleasure in life.

3
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.850
I believe there's only a relief from pain. We have to suffer to be on top.

4
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.530
So isn't there something to just the suffering in itself,

5
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.410
just doing really difficult, just to get to the top.

6
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.360
<v 1>To explain that. And so people can relate to it cuz not everybody's a fighter.</v>

7
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.200
I think the best example I can give is

8
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.200
let's say you're you haven't eat for a long time and you're you're craving.

9
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.120
Right? So you're suffering. And then when it's time to eat,

10
00:00:41.121 --> 00:00:44.030
finally, you're about to eat your a dish.

11
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.270
It's gonna taste so much better.

12
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.750
So that's why I believe there's always a,

13
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.910
some sort of sacrifice before the pleasure. And the more sacrifice you do,

14
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.550
like the, they say in fighting the, the bigger, the risk bigger is the reward.

15
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.420
And I feel that's, that's how it, it is for.

16
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.700
<v 0>Me. Yeah. I feel that with, uh,</v>

17
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.780
I've started fasting a little bit in the past couple of years and uh,

18
00:01:10.781 --> 00:01:15.420
there's nothing as amazing as a delicious meal or anything, actually.

19
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.100
Anything, any food when you haven't eaten for several days, it's,

20
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.460
it's kind of incredible. Uh, it's not,

21
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.810
it's not incredible in this simple way of finally I get to eat it's you get to

22
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.970
truly experience the, the beauty of, of what it is to be alive.

23
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.810
Like that little piece of food, you see all the flavors you, you, you,

24
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.970
you feel just the experience of it is, uh,

25
00:01:40.971 --> 00:01:44.570
ultimately of gratitude of how awesome it is to be alive.

26
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.760
But when you eat many times a day and you're PI out and you don't get to

27
00:01:49.761 --> 00:01:51.920
experience that, and it's fascinating, it's really,

28
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.800
it is really like fasting is one of the most accessible things for people.

29
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.040
I think to experience that kind of, uh, pairing of hardship to pleasure.

30
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.550
<v 1>I agree. And in my case, it changed my life life on a good, good way.</v>

31
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.750
I cannot recommend it to people because everybody is different.

32
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.590
But after my, to,

33
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.310
to fight Michael BI being my last fight was against, uh,

34
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.230
the champion in the heavier weight class that I used to compete at.

35
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.500
So I thought that if I would gain weight,

36
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.860
it would increase my performance. And I struggle a lot to gain weight.

37
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.940
I gain a lot about eight to 10, 10 pounds.

38
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.580
Normally I walk around 180 5 pounds and for that fight,

39
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.580
I was walking around 1 95. However,

40
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.970
I forced myself to eat like six times a day. I was on a very,

41
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.290
uh, strict diet and I didn't feel,

42
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.010
it didn't feel right to me because I feel like I,

43
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.690
I was carrying like a little bit,

44
00:02:56.691 --> 00:02:59.920
like I was carrying a bag on my shoulder mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and

45
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.480
I think it was a bad idea for me because when I

46
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.560
did the weight, the weighing and I,

47
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.440
I go went on a scale at 180 5. I couldn't go back to my initial weight.

48
00:03:13.441 --> 00:03:18.200
That was 180, 1 95 that I worked so hard for several months. Yeah.

49
00:03:18.201 --> 00:03:21.750
To get there. So I was one 90 pound,

50
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.710
but I couldn't get back in the morning of the fight. I, I, I, I got, I got sick.

51
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.710
I had like, uh, we didn't know what,

52
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.870
what it was in the beginning because in order to know,

53
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.990
to find out what it was, I needed to do what they call a colonoscopy.

54
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.780
They put a camera inside of you. And to do that, they give you, um,

55
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.380
something that makes that, that empty you. And I was trying to gain weight,

56
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.820
not to lose weight &lt;laugh&gt; so I,

57
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.860
I told myself I'm gonna wait after the fight. Yeah. Whatever it is,

58
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.340
because it was pretty bad. It was blood. And I, I didn't know what I was.

59
00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.450
I was very concerned. I thought I had maybe cancer. I was freaking out.

60
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.130
So I said, I'm gonna do that fight. And then after right away,

61
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.410
I'm gonna make a checkup. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. So I did that fight.

62
00:04:07.411 --> 00:04:10.290
Everything went well. I wanted the fight. I went back home.

63
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.850
I did the colonoscopy and I, I got diagnosed with ulcer colitis.

64
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.810
Then I got on very severe medication, uh, to get better.

65
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.280
And I'm not a big fan of medication.

66
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.640
I always trying to look for more natural way to, to,

67
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.480
to get better. And I found out about fasting and, um,

68
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.600
it really changed my life. I met Dr. Jason fun was one of the,

69
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.320
one of, one of the world authority of, of fasting.

70
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.710
He treat diabetes patient with fasting and he gave me a program of fasting.

71
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.550
And, um, it really changed my life.
