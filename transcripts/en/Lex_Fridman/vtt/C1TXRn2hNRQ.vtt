00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.940
<v 0>Humor is a fundamental part of the existentialist</v>

2
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.540
ethic. That's able to deal with absurdity. Yeah. You gotta like laugh at.

3
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.060
<v 1>It. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah, I think there is some, I love,</v>

4
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.700
let me just say something about humor, cuz I think you're absolutely right.

5
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.260
Kard who is Danish and you know,

6
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.250
most people think deeply depressed and then on he's actually an incredibly funny

7
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.970
writer and someone who was a classmate of mine graduate school who

8
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.450
left philosophy to become a Hollywood comedy writer. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; uh,

9
00:00:35.451 --> 00:00:36.650
he's very successful guy.

10
00:00:36.651 --> 00:00:40.770
<v 2>And then he came back 25 years later and wrote, finished his dissertation.</v>

11
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.143
And I was the,

12
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.400
the reader on the dissert and there may be a conflict of interest.

13
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.160
I'm not quite sure &lt;laugh&gt; but, but uh, his dissertation was about,

14
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.720
he called it Kard and the funny, which is a good title, kind of a funny title.

15
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.200
Yeah. But, but ki guard, according to Eric Kaplan's reading, um,

16
00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.920
Kard has, um,

17
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.070
does have this idea that there's something de stable about humor.

18
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.190
<v 1>That's crucial to the sort of</v>

19
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.670
the important possibilities for us. And, and so he,

20
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.070
there's the idea that like there's a moment when a joke is being set up

21
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.230
when you're sort of proceeding as if you're on stable ground mm-hmm

22
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.300
&lt;affirmative&gt; and then the punchline comes and the rug is pulled out from under

23
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.100
you. And for a moment it's like, you're falling. You don't, you, you,

24
00:01:34.101 --> 00:01:38.780
there's nothing supporting you &lt;laugh&gt; until you're captured by your

25
00:01:38.781 --> 00:01:41.980
totally new understanding of what was going on.

26
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.450
And that humor necessary has that kind of destabilizing

27
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.690
feature to it.

28
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.410
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and that's like the riskiness that's like the riskiness

29
00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:55.730
that you were, you were pointing to. If, if there aren't risks in your life,

30
00:01:55.731 --> 00:02:00.210
if your life is totally safe, then there's no possibility of significance.

31
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.370
And so I think on Eric's reading,

32
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.200
Kard sort of wants to line up up the importance of the riskiness and

33
00:02:08.201 --> 00:02:11.880
vulnerability in your life to it's having meaning mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; with the

34
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.920
experience of destabilization that you get in jokes in comedy,

35
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.720
um, which then becomes significant, right? That when you,

36
00:02:20.721 --> 00:02:23.640
when you remember having heard a joke for the first time,

37
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.280
it's gotta kind of salience for.
