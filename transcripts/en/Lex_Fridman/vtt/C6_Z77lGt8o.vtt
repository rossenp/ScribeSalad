00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.780
<v 0>So people love it. When we talk about books,</v>

2
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.680
is there books, maybe three or so technical fiction,

3
00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:15.000
philosophical that had an impact on your life and you might recommend,

4
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.530
and for each, is there an idea or so that you take away from it?

5
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.620
<v 1>Yes. Um,</v>

6
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.970
so I've been a veracious reader all my life,

7
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.340
um, and I'm always reading like three or four or five books at a time.

8
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.010
Um, and now I use audible a lot too, and, you know,

9
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.260
podcasts and things like that. Um,

10
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.790
so I think the first one that stands out to me is, um,

11
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.350
10 it's a novel, um,

12
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.950
tender is the night by Fitzgerald and I,

13
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.230
I read it when I was much younger,

14
00:00:51.231 --> 00:00:53.750
but I went back and read it recently and it's not that good.

15
00:00:53.751 --> 00:00:57.890
So I'm not sure why it has like, such an important place, um,

16
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.520
in my literary history. But, um,

17
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.670
I love Fitzgerald as an author because he's very,

18
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.520
he's very like flowery prose, um,

19
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.240
that I can just picture what he's saying,

20
00:01:11.241 --> 00:01:14.450
but he does it in a such a creative way.

21
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.780
I remember that one in particular because it, you know,

22
00:01:17.781 --> 00:01:21.410
I read a ton as a kid too, but it kind of set me,

23
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.760
it was like the beginning of my adult reading life and, um,

24
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.990
getting into classics and, um, I kind of,

25
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.160
I do feel like I, they seem intimidating maybe.

26
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.090
And then I realized that they're all just like, love stories. Um,

27
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.550
uh, so.

28
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.570
<v 0>Yeah, isn't everything the stores, the bottom.</v>

29
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.700
<v 1>Even, you know, I don't know.</v>

30
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.560
I w I was surprised that even like a lot of the Russian authors, um,

31
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.210
you know, that's all, they're all just love stories.

32
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.930
<v 0>Where humans are pretty simple. There's not much, there's not much to work with.</v>

33
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.470
So.

34
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.670
<v 1>So I think maybe that was it,</v>

35
00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:02.150
it made like that whole world less intimidating to me and,

36
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.630
and cemented my love for reading.

37
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.150
<v 0>People should have just approached the classics. Like,</v>

38
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.740
there's probably a lot of strain here,

39
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.790
some somehow Harbaugh's out to check, so just relax and enjoy the ride. Um,

40
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.313
so what else.

41
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.290
<v 1>Um, changing gears quite a bit, um, the beginning of infinity,</v>

42
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.490
do you know it by David Deutsch? Um, so he's a physicist, um,

43
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.960
I think at Cambridge or Oxford.

44
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.970
And so I was introduced like more formally to a lot of the

45
00:02:34.971 --> 00:02:39.170
ideas. Like a lot of the things we've talked about, he, um,

46
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.500
has a lot more like formalism and, um,

47
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.130
physics rigor around. And so I got introduced to, you know,

48
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.490
more like jargon of how to think about some of these ideas, um, um,

49
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.580
you know, like memes and, you know, DNA as,

50
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.090
as the ultimate meme, um, uh,

51
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.470
the concept of infinity and, um,

52
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.050
objective beauty. Um,

53
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.160
but he has a really strong grounding in physics. Um, and then she's.

54
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.230
<v 0>A rigorous way of talking about these like big.</v>

55
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.370
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

56
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.110
So that was very mind opening to me to read that,

57
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:17.980
but it also,

58
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.090
I think is probably part of why I ended up marrying my husband is related to

59
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:22.601
that book.

60
00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:27.130
And then I've had some other really great connections with people because I had

61
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:29.110
read it. And so had they, um, sorry.

62
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.900
<v 0>Let's say you turn that, that, even that book into a little story I did</v>

63
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.193
exactly.

64
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.370
<v 1>And okay. The third, uh,</v>

65
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.230
series is it's just it's Harry Potter. Um.

66
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.190
<v 0>Of course, which somehow connects to, I haven't read Harry Potter.</v>

67
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.960
I'm really sorry. I forgive me, forgive me. Uh, but,

68
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.920
uh, have read token, but just Harry Potter just haven't, haven't gotten to it,

69
00:03:58.921 --> 00:04:02.370
but, uh, your company name is somehow I think, connects with Harry Potter.

70
00:04:02.371 --> 00:04:04.140
Right? You heard this?

71
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.243
<v 1>My,</v>

72
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.290
I always feel like I have to justify my fandom.

73
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.070
Um, the first three books came out when I was 10.

74
00:04:14.071 --> 00:04:17.970
So I went along this journey with Harry, um, age wise,

75
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.410
and I read them all like nine or 10

76
00:04:22.411 --> 00:04:26.370
times, all seven books. And I think, um,

77
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.110
anything that just keeps you reading as is what's important. And you know,

78
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.570
there, I have lulls where I don't feel like reading anything.

79
00:04:33.571 --> 00:04:38.070
So I'll reread a Harry Potter or a, you know, trashy,

80
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.370
detective novel or something. And, and I don't really care.

81
00:04:41.371 --> 00:04:46.110
And that's why I mentioned Harry Potter because it, you know,

82
00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:49.710
whatever just keeps me reading, I think is important. And, um,

83
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.600
it was a big part of my life growing up. And then, yes, Axion I,

84
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.100
the official story of the naming of the company is that

85
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.140
Axion is like a concatenation of accelerate and ion,

86
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.860
but it actually came from Accu, the summoning charm,

87
00:05:07.861 --> 00:05:10.380
and then we just added an end and it was perfect.

88
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.340
<v 0>What's the Sony term. That's just one of the spells.</v>

89
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.973
<v 1>Um,</v>

90
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.630
Mo probably most notably Harry uses it to summon his

91
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.850
broomstick out of his dorm room when he's battling a dragon somewhere else.

92
00:05:26.851 --> 00:05:30.630
So he says the spell and the broomstick comes to him. So summoning in that way.

93
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.843
Okay. There we go.

94
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.690
<v 0>This is brilliant. So the, the, the big thing is that, uh,</v>

95
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.850
it's something that you've carry with. It's like your safe place,

96
00:05:41.851 --> 00:05:44.070
you returned to something like the Harry Potter.

97
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.020
<v 1>That, you know, I reread them still. Um, whatever keeps me reading,</v>

98
00:05:49.021 --> 00:05:53.310
I think is, is the most important thing. Yeah.

99
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.910
<v 0>The same way in terms of the habit of it. It's</v>

100
00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.190
that it's important to just keep, keep reading.

101
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.240
But I have found myself struggling a little bit too,

102
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.280
because I listened to a lot of audio books.

103
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:12.170
Now I've struggled to then switch back to reading

104
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:16.880
seriously. Uh, it's just, uh, read so many papers, recently,

105
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.863
many other things.

106
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.830
It feels like if I'm going to sit down and have the time to actually focus on

107
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:22.610
the reading,

108
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.230
I should be reading like blog posts or papers or more condensed kind of things.

109
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.550
But there there's a huge value to just reading long form still.

110
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.490
<v 1>Yeah. And you know, my husband was never that into fiction,</v>

111
00:06:36.491 --> 00:06:40.570
but then someone pulled him or he heard, um, you know,

112
00:06:40.571 --> 00:06:44.170
you learn a lot of empathy through reading fiction. Um,

113
00:06:44.171 --> 00:06:45.520
so you could think of it that way.

114
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.480
<v 0>Yeah. That's kind of what the, yeah. The, and it's also a fiction is a nice,</v>

115
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.360
unlike, not the less so with nonfiction is a chance to travel.

116
00:06:55.361 --> 00:06:59.320
I see it as kind of traveling cause you go to this other world and it's,

117
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:01.720
it's nice. Cause it's like much more efficient.

118
00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:03.250
You don't have to get on a plane, you know,

119
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.520
and you get to meet all kinds of new people.

120
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.330
It's like people say they love traveling. And I say, I love traveling too.

121
00:07:10.331 --> 00:07:11.740
I just, yeah. Read fiction.

122
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.180
<v 1>I told my, um, three-year-old that,</v>

123
00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.660
that was why we read so much. Cause we, you know,

124
00:07:19.661 --> 00:07:21.940
see the places in our mind and I'm like,

125
00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:25.900
it's basically like we're watching a movie, you know, that's how it feels.

126
00:07:25.901 --> 00:07:30.520
And she's like, I prefer watching frozen with popcorn. Was it her response?

127
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.290
That you're three.

128
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.670
<v 0>That's a good point. Uh, but yeah, there's some power to the imagination, right?</v>

129
00:07:36.671 --> 00:07:40.060
That's not just like watching a movie because some,

130
00:07:40.061 --> 00:07:42.670
something about our Mar imagination. Cause it's,

131
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.590
it's the words in the world that's painted somehow mixing in with our own

132
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.520
understanding of our own hopes and dreams or fears.

133
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:55.870
It like mixes up in there and the way we can build up that world from just the

134
00:07:55.871 --> 00:07:56.560
page.

135
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.393
<v 1>Yeah. You're,</v>

136
00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:02.050
you're really creating the world just with the like prompts from the book,

137
00:08:02.051 --> 00:08:04.450
right? Yeah. Yeah. That's different than watching a movie.
