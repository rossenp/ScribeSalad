00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.040
<v 0>Is it possible that like,</v>

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.120
basically the entirety of earth will be like a computing surface.

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.160
Like this table will be doing computing. This hedgehog will be doing computing.

4
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:17.360
Like everything really inefficient. Don computing will be.

5
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.200
<v 1>Fiction books. They call it computronium comput,</v>

6
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.800
return everything into computing. Well,

7
00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:26.230
most so the elements aren't very good for anything. Like,

8
00:00:26.231 --> 00:00:29.350
you're not gonna make a computer out of iron, like, you know, Silicon and,

9
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.270
and carbon have like nice structures. You know, I, we we'll see what,

10
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.470
what you can do with the rest of it. I just like people talk about, well,

11
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:41.870
maybe we can turn the sun into computer, but it's, it's hydrogen and a little,

12
00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:43.270
little bit of helium. So.

13
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.140
<v 0>What, what I mean is more like actually just adding computers to everything. Oh.</v>

14
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.460
<v 1>Okay. So thought you're just con converting all the mass to the universe into</v>

15
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.320
computer.

16
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.940
<v 0>No, no, no. So not using, so.</v>

17
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.780
<v 1>Be ironic from the simulation point of view is like the simulator build mass,</v>

18
00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.980
the simulates, like.

19
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.580
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, yeah. So I mean,</v>

20
00:01:01.581 --> 00:01:04.370
ultimately this is all heading towards the simulation. Yes. Well.

21
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.850
<v 1>I, I think I might have told you this story at Tesla, they were deciding,</v>

22
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.170
so they wanna measure the current coming out of the battery and they decided

23
00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:16.050
between putting a resistor in there and putting a computer with a

24
00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:19.250
sensor in there mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and the computer was faster than the

25
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.530
computer I, I worked on in 1982 and we,

26
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.960
we chose the computer cause it was cheaper than the resistor. So,

27
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.480
so sure this hedgehog, you know, it costs $13 and we can put a, you know,

28
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.600
an AI that's the smartest you in there for five bucks, it'll have one, you know,

29
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.080
so computers will be, you know, be everywhere.

30
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.840
<v 0>I was hoping it wouldn't be smarter than me because, well.</v>

31
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.800
<v 1>Everything's gonna be smarter.</v>

32
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.030
<v 0>Than you. But you were saying it's inefficient.</v>

33
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.670
I thought it was better to have a lot of dumb.

34
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.430
<v 1>Things. Well, well Moore's law will slowly compact that.</v>

35
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.430
<v 0>Stuff. So even the dumb things will be smarter.</v>

36
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.890
<v 1>Than us.</v>

37
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.790
The dumb things are gonna be smart or they're gonna be smart enough to talk to

38
00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:58.910
something that's really smart. You know, it's like,

39
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.070
well, just remember like a big computer chip. Yeah. You know,

40
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.940
it's like an inch by an inch and you know, 40 microns thick.

41
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.060
It doesn't take very much, very many atoms to make a, you know,

42
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:15.460
high power computer. Yeah. And 10,000 of 'em can fit in the shoebox.

43
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.940
But you know, you have the, the cooling and power problems, but you know,

44
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.060
people are working on that.

45
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.410
<v 0>But they still can't write, uh, compelling poetry music or, uh, uh,</v>

46
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.250
understand what love is or have a fear of mortality. So, so we're still winning.

47
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.930
Neither.

48
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.210
<v 1>Can most of humanity so.</v>

49
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.450
<v 0>Well they can write books about it.</v>
