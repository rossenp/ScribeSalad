WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.920
<v 0>So speaking of things that, uh, didn't follow a perfect theory, a model,</v>

2
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.360
a JavaScript. So there's two things, one, it had an impact on the world,

3
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.740
a huge scale.

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.630
Obviously it is also still is one of probably the

5
00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:20.610
most popular programming language in the world.

6
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.570
So can we go back to the origin story? Uh,

7
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.150
can you tell the story of how JavaScript was created?

8
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.000
<v 1>Yeah. I was at Silicon graphics after graduate school for seven years</v>

9
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.810
and it got to be big and successful and divisionalized and political,

10
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.650
and I thought I'm kind of boring.

11
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.410
And a friend who'd been there went to, uh,

12
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.710
one of the last of the super companies, super startups in,

13
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.530
in the early nineties. There were several, I suppose,

14
00:00:48.531 --> 00:00:51.080
general magic was a little after that, around the same time.

15
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.400
But micro unity was that company that I went to and it was because my friend,

16
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.470
Jeff Weinstein had gone there for Silicon graphics.

17
00:00:57.471 --> 00:01:01.790
He recruited me and my community was doing everything. So this was,

18
00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:06.680
this was like the ultimate sort of pretend grad school. It was doing a new fab,

19
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.190
new semiconductor process. It was doing new, um,

20
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.110
analog and digital circuits on the same, very large, but not wafer scale chip.

21
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.820
Um, originally it was, um, five centimeters on a side. Let me see.

22
00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:24.680
It was really hot too. So I needed a water cooler. Um, it was a crank Hiller,

23
00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:28.940
and then they shrunk it and they tried to do a home sort of media processor that

24
00:01:28.941 --> 00:01:32.690
was essentially a barrel processor. But you could think of, um,

25
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.360
trying to do all the things that we now see in modern architectures with short

26
00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:41.000
vector instructions and, um,

27
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.510
sort of wide instructions or multiple issue, uh, and,

28
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.590
and doing a lot of this stuff in software because the second iteration,

29
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.970
the set-top box was really for avoiding the cost to the cable company of rolling

30
00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:57.320
the trucks out to replace your garbage general Atlantic set-top box with a

31
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.150
totally new or less, less a garbage one. So if you could have software gradable,

32
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.460
um, set-top boxes, the cable companies, uh,

33
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.350
thought they could save a lot of money and add features.

34
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.390
<v 0>This is assembly or which level.</v>

35
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.280
<v 1>We were riding in, in. Um, we were using GCC,</v>

36
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.540
we're getting C plus plus and C uh, somebody I, I worked with there, um,

37
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.040
really smart guy hired from a sort of wall street. Um,

38
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.090
hot shot programming consultancy did his own hardware design as well as

39
00:02:26.091 --> 00:02:28.790
software. And we were working on how to make, uh,

40
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.540
not only these short vector units, but general bit shufflers per meters.

41
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.920
So you could do things like, um, uh, you know, crypto algorithms efficiently,

42
00:02:36.921 --> 00:02:41.810
and you could do, uh, the modulation of the cable, you know, complex, uh,

43
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.400
quadrature, amplitude modulated signal. So you were basically taking, uh,

44
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.440
add converters, dumping things in buffers,

45
00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:51.830
and then doing the rest of the software, all the framing and the Reed,

46
00:02:51.831 --> 00:02:53.660
Solomon and Viterbi and all that aircraft.

47
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.390
So that was really great learning experience, but it was not going to work.

48
00:02:56.391 --> 00:02:59.920
It was doing too many risky things at once, right? If you, as Clark said to me,

49
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:03.310
when I hopped to Netscape after three years at Mike Rian and he said, Oh yeah,

50
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.270
you'll do 10 things. Each one in 10 odds, it's going to be one in 10 million.

51
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.590
Um, the multiplication principle. So, you know,

52
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.910
that scape was already a rocket and I passed the chance to go there in 1994.

53
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.360
I knew the founders cause I worked at SGI Clark's company.

54
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.400
<v 2>Could you pause for a second and Netscape? When was the launch of this rocket?</v>

55
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.880
What? Uh, 94 94 was the launch of Netscape. And.

56
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.920
<v 1>I went there in early 95 in April.</v>

57
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.590
<v 2>Okay. But, Oh, so you said you missed the launch.</v>

58
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.380
<v 1>The, the, the first floor employment opportunity, but the IPO was,</v>

59
00:03:36.381 --> 00:03:38.110
was August, 1995. So I was there for.

60
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.370
<v 2>How obvious was it? The nest Cape was like world changing.</v>

61
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.600
What was the layout was an one of the first big browsers. Yeah.

62
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.720
<v 1>Yes. So when, when I was at micro unity still in 93,</v>

63
00:03:48.721 --> 00:03:53.430
we saw a browser called mosaic and up until then we'd used email and we'd used

64
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.110
Usenet, the NITV protocol we use newsreaders. We used FTP.

65
00:03:58.111 --> 00:03:59.790
We used all these old internet protocols,

66
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.440
all relying on the DNS and TCP and UDP for that matter. Um,

67
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.920
when I was at Silicon graphics, we brought up the whole stack, right? We had to,

68
00:04:07.921 --> 00:04:08.840
you know, discover how,

69
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.110
how to find the ethernet addresses on your network and then find IP addresses

70
00:04:13.111 --> 00:04:15.360
for them, our protocol, all that stuff.

71
00:04:15.361 --> 00:04:19.020
And it was great because nobody knew in the eighties what was going to win all

72
00:04:19.021 --> 00:04:23.250
the proprietary stacks like IBM SNA and deck net,

73
00:04:23.251 --> 00:04:25.800
and all these other protocols were saying, we're going to do it,

74
00:04:25.801 --> 00:04:29.280
or it's going to be heterogeneous future. And instead it was, you know,

75
00:04:29.281 --> 00:04:34.110
Berkeley Unix and the TCP IP stack that dated back to the ARPANET, that one.

76
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.400
And I think we knew it. We all knew it at SGN, but the salespeople didn't.

77
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.150
And so they kept trying to get multiple networks next interoperating,

78
00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:43.830
but in the end, uh, it won.

79
00:04:43.831 --> 00:04:48.390
And so that was the internet and it was email and texting and it was used that

80
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.990
very texting. And then, uh, Tim Berners Lee did his thing,

81
00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:53.310
but I don't think I was paying attention.

82
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.800
And I think the date when he first did it,

83
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.620
or when he wrote the famous email has been pushed back to 89.

84
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.810
But I noticed a mosaic in 93 because one of the things that Mark Andreessen

85
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.010
and Eric Bina did at NCSA was they innovated on,

86
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.460
on the HTML early HTML standard. They in particular,

87
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.080
Mark sent this email saying, Hey, everybody,

88
00:05:13.081 --> 00:05:16.470
we think you'd be able to put an image in a page. And, you know,

89
00:05:16.471 --> 00:05:19.560
when he sent that Eric Bean has already written the code. And, you know,

90
00:05:19.561 --> 00:05:22.080
I talked to Tim Berners leaving more recently, just a few years ago.

91
00:05:22.081 --> 00:05:24.180
And he was like, Oh, we had another way of doing it. And then, you know,

92
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.300
it didn't work out. Cause Mark shipped his in mosaic.

93
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.520
And this convinced me of several things.

94
00:05:29.521 --> 00:05:34.170
One the internet meant there was a huge first mover advantage and

95
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.970
being fast, getting on first mattered a lot. And so, you know, Richard Gabriel,

96
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.710
uh, scheme and poetry fame has written about this, the famous century poetry,

97
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.390
uh, well, he's a poet, uh.

98
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.160
<v 2>Actual poetry. He's like, no.</v>

99
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.590
<v 1>No. I mean, he's the founder of lucid,</v>

100
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.690
which is where Jamie's the ski worked before.

101
00:05:51.691 --> 00:05:55.740
And that scape and lucid was doing, you know, compilers and lucid Emacs,

102
00:05:55.741 --> 00:05:59.480
which was a fork of BMX famously Jamie fighting against, uh,

103
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:03.560
Richard Stallman stall max. Um, so Richard Gabriel, you know, very,

104
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.480
very brainy computer guy, but also a poet,

105
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.660
but he wrote a nice essay that gets abused all the time. In fact,

106
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:12.500
Jamie's put a kind of warning in front of his version of it on his site, JDBC,

107
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.820
another, there were called worse is better.

108
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.680
And this is about survival advantage of software in a networked world.

109
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:23.090
In my opinion, it's about Unix. It started out being framed as unison lists,

110
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.870
good news, bad news, because all the lists people, the MIT people were like, Oh,

111
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.780
you know, this is the crown Juul, right? A scheme.

112
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:33.500
This is fabric AA or common list. This giant cathedral, of course,

113
00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:35.990
we're going to win. This is civilization. You know,

114
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:38.540
those farmers in New Jersey to borrow from the Sopranos,

115
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.450
those pigs down at bell labs. They're just, you know,

116
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.350
there's nothing sound there. It's all hacking. Um, well guess what one.

117
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.910
<v 3>You, you're saying, this is a fundamental,</v>

118
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.010
like principle of the internet is moving fast wins.

119
00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.700
<v 1>You could say in, in almost any network system, like biological evolution,</v>

120
00:06:57.701 --> 00:07:01.990
you see successful ilial sweet populations and they don't always have, um,

121
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.800
you know, they aren't free of flaws, heterozygous advantage, right?

122
00:07:05.801 --> 00:07:08.550
You can get both parents, uh, give you the,

123
00:07:08.551 --> 00:07:11.470
the gene variant and you get sickle cell anemia. Right. But,

124
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.190
but if one of them does, you're more resistant to malaria. And so this isn't,

125
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.940
um, a beautiful process except at large scale.

126
00:07:18.941 --> 00:07:23.260
And then you realize that because it moves fast and can adapt it, it can win.

127
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.990
And people still struggle with this.

128
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.140
I used to struggle with this because JavaScript was done in such a hurry.

129
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.210
And the force of web compatibility meant early mistakes couldn't be fixed.

130
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.440
And even the standards process injected new mistakes as well. Uh,

131
00:07:38.441 --> 00:07:41.110
but often standards bodies go back and making compatible changes.

132
00:07:41.111 --> 00:07:44.880
You can't do that with the web. It's more like, again, like biology, you,

133
00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.540
you preserve what still works.

134
00:07:46.541 --> 00:07:50.890
You don't want to break ATP metabolism or whatever. So, um,

135
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.510
you have to kind of resign yourself to the reality of, um,

136
00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:00.370
worse is better being enshrined in actual

137
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.880
design points. You might not like, um,

138
00:08:02.881 --> 00:08:06.580
and that happened with JavaScript and I'm way over it. But, uh, it also,

139
00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:11.230
I think was a huge advantage why JavaScript is kind of swept a lot of

140
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.590
programming domains. Um, people will say, Oh, it's not because of merit. Well,

141
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.020
you're right. But we also improved it over time in the standards body.

142
00:08:17.021 --> 00:08:21.760
I spent 20 years doing that. And, uh, you don't get that choice. It's like,

143
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.760
I'm not saying that that was the best language.

144
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:26.650
I'm just saying that was the right time to do it.

145
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.880
And I like to say the alternative was not to do it. I could have told Netscape,

146
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.910
I can't do this. It's too rushed. And it would have been visual,

147
00:08:33.911 --> 00:08:36.430
basic script would have been bad.

148
00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:40.060
<v 3>That's a good way to present the alternative. But so your,</v>

149
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:43.300
it was a Netscape and you, you have written it. And how many days,

150
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.310
and why was it only that many days?

151
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.760
And what was the goal and the underlying principles in your mind?

152
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:49.780
<v 1>So the whole, uh,</v>

153
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:53.020
I'm sort of describing horses better in a frenetic way because it fit the,

154
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.590
the model of Netscape. When, when, um,

155
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.730
it was known that Jim Clark and Mark and Reese were founding Netscape and they

156
00:08:59.731 --> 00:09:04.590
did the first release in 1994, that browser took over from mosaic. In fact,

157
00:09:04.591 --> 00:09:07.680
that's why Mozilla is called that it's the mosaic killer.

158
00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:10.830
It's like the giant monster that kills mosaic. It's awesome. And, um,

159
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.650
they knew that, you know, it wasn't, it wasn't that again,

160
00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:16.560
it's not like you're doing advanced scientific research that is changing the

161
00:09:16.561 --> 00:09:19.210
world. You're more like taking down, uh,

162
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.160
the last iteration in the browser market, which had images and, you know,

163
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:26.760
other affordances before you stopped working on it and you're making Netscape

164
00:09:26.761 --> 00:09:29.070
the new thing that has images, plugins,

165
00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:30.870
which was the way to do video back in the day,

166
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.470
it had something that's kind of died now for tiled windows called frames and

167
00:09:34.471 --> 00:09:38.700
frame sets have yay, HTML tables. That was new.

168
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:42.120
Eric Dina did tables and Netscape one-on-one. So when I got there,

169
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.900
they were heading toward IPO. Clark wanted to IPO early.

170
00:09:45.901 --> 00:09:49.680
I think his instinct was right. And that kicked off the whole.com era, right?

171
00:09:49.681 --> 00:09:52.200
There was a recession in the U S in 91.

172
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.950
You can see old law and order reruns where they talk about the recession,

173
00:09:55.951 --> 00:09:58.650
how hard it's hitting new Yorkers. And after that, uh,

174
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.920
Greenspan really goose things at the federal reserve. And,

175
00:10:00.921 --> 00:10:05.460
and technology had been sort of fermenting in a way that came together with the

176
00:10:05.461 --> 00:10:09.450
internet and that scape made it possible to do pets.com,

177
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.970
to do eBay, to get people,

178
00:10:11.971 --> 00:10:15.030
to recognize a URL on a billboard and then type it in when they get home.

179
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:20.310
And that was huge. Um, that, that was so fast moving a rocket that, uh,

180
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:22.403
Mark and, um,

181
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:27.360
the engineering team there thought we need to make this a programmable browser,

182
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:30.300
not just, uh, a document viewer, not just a video.

183
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:34.520
<v 3>All HTML with images and tables. And also like you said, frames,</v>

184
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:37.070
and really the plugins, there is no dynamic element at all.

185
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:39.140
<v 1>Yeah. The most dynamism you get was from a plugin,</v>

186
00:10:39.141 --> 00:10:43.850
which there are a few of them then flash didn't exist at that point. Uh, it was,

187
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.000
I think, um, Java applets are not well,

188
00:10:47.001 --> 00:10:49.310
that's the thing we did that deal with sun. In fact,

189
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:52.010
I was recruited to go do scheme in the browser.

190
00:10:52.011 --> 00:10:55.520
Remember guys stealing Gerald's husband's beautiful list variants.

191
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:59.150
I was going to do it in the browser because my friends rescue, I thought, Hey,

192
00:10:59.151 --> 00:11:01.610
we like scheme you like scheme. And I'm like, I hardly ever use scheme.

193
00:11:01.611 --> 00:11:06.170
It's not really used in industry except in sort of silos. Um, but I like it.

194
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:11.510
Okay. I'll come do scheme in the browser. I have a slide from my 2017,

195
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.780
uh,

196
00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:15.620
talk where I have Bruce Wallace crawling through the duct and diehard is kind of

197
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:19.790
after the coast, the fun come on and do scheme in the browser. Um,

198
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:20.661
but when I got there,

199
00:11:20.661 --> 00:11:23.150
there was no scheme in the browser because they'd started a deal with sun

200
00:11:23.151 --> 00:11:26.480
Microsystems and my best contact. There was bill joy,

201
00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:29.960
who I admired as a Berkeley Unix founder, and, you know, son, founder, uh,

202
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.350
and bill got the idea of making the browser programmable too.

203
00:11:33.351 --> 00:11:36.620
And so the idea main idea was to put the job of VM,

204
00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:41.540
which at that point was not really easy to embed into Netscape,

205
00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.080
including the Netscape version of windows that was still most popular,

206
00:11:45.081 --> 00:11:49.010
which was the 16 bit windows three one, which was going away.

207
00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.980
Microsoft is coming out with windows 95 and everyone was afraid.

208
00:11:51.981 --> 00:11:55.900
They were going to do you internet Explorer, I guess two, at that 0.3,

209
00:11:55.901 --> 00:12:00.370
the next year they already bought, uh, or invested in somehow Spyglass,

210
00:12:00.371 --> 00:12:04.960
this other company that shot out from NCSA university of Illinois.

211
00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.180
Um, and in fact,

212
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.600
Microsoft had tried to buy Netscape in late 94 before I got there.

213
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:15.130
And I heard about this later, I heard they offered way too little money. And so,

214
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.640
you know, Jim Barksdale and Jim Clark said, get out of here pound sand,

215
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.160
but then they realized, Oh,

216
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.490
this is going to hurt us because now they're going to copy us.

217
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:25.721
It didn't happen right away.

218
00:12:25.721 --> 00:12:29.440
I'm not sure when Gates internet tidal wave memo was written.

219
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:33.520
That's the famous memo he wrote when bill Gates realized that Microsoft was

220
00:12:33.521 --> 00:12:37.810
going down this old copy AOL path or copy CompuServe path,

221
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:42.370
a project called Blackbird, presumably after the Sr 71, I don't know,

222
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.240
but they were going to make a dial up service with a custom content,

223
00:12:46.241 --> 00:12:50.530
language stack and custom rendering. It wasn't the web. Um, and you know,

224
00:12:50.531 --> 00:12:53.440
they could have content partners. Uh, they have a lot of money,

225
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:55.390
but it still wasn't the scale of the web.

226
00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:58.630
It wasn't going to be compelling and Gates realized this and he turned the

227
00:12:58.631 --> 00:13:02.770
company on a dime and they couldn't buy Netscape again. I'm not sure the timing,

228
00:13:02.771 --> 00:13:03.970
so they decided to copy it.

229
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.440
And once we realized that everybody inside Netscape felt even more urgency and

230
00:13:08.441 --> 00:13:09.820
more frenetic mood.

231
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:14.920
And so my chance to do scheme disappeared when the Java deal started brewing,

232
00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.870
but there was still a chance to do a companion language to Java because Java was

233
00:13:19.871 --> 00:13:24.040
a compiled is a compiled language it's evolved and improved quite a lot since

234
00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:24.401
then, too.

235
00:13:24.401 --> 00:13:28.990
But it was for sort of serious advanced programmers that cost a certain

236
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.370
salary or hourly rate.

237
00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:34.720
And people observe bill they'll join observed and Marc Andreessen.

238
00:13:34.721 --> 00:13:37.390
And I observed that in a mature stack like Microsoft,

239
00:13:37.391 --> 00:13:40.420
you really benefit from having a scripting language like visual basic,

240
00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.090
which became visual basic script and [inaudible]

241
00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:43.090
, but didn't take on, didn't take over kill Java script

242
00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:43.923
 that you need two languages.

243
00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.730
One is for that component writers who are higher price and more expert.

244
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.130
And the other is for, uh,

245
00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.960
scripters certified public accountants, uh, designers,

246
00:13:58.961 --> 00:14:02.380
graphic designers with some programming, inclination, anybody amateurs.

247
00:14:02.381 --> 00:14:05.400
It doesn't matter. There's a much more demotic, uh,

248
00:14:05.401 --> 00:14:09.010
approach there for programming the components together, gluing them together.

249
00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:11.920
Somebody will say duct tape language, which I don't really like,

250
00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.550
but we saw the bill joy and Mark and Vincent. And I,

251
00:14:15.551 --> 00:14:18.490
we saw the need for companion language and the gleaming,

252
00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.440
or I was to call it JavaScript. I didn't like it.

253
00:14:20.441 --> 00:14:24.100
That was marketing plan Mark called it mocha, which I liked.

254
00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.130
And that's marketing. I think didn't like that. So they said, Oh,

255
00:14:27.131 --> 00:14:30.280
there's some trademark in some software somewhere that's uses mocha.

256
00:14:30.281 --> 00:14:34.450
So we can't use that. And they tried live script in August and that didn't last.

257
00:14:34.451 --> 00:14:37.840
And then finally we got the trademark license in December, 1985,

258
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:42.040
but the work I did to prove that it could be done was important because

259
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:47.980
I came in in April and even then Netscape was growing so fast that they

260
00:14:47.981 --> 00:14:51.770
couldn't find open hiring requisition in the client team for me.

261
00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:55.280
So they hired me into the server team and I worked for a month on the server

262
00:14:55.281 --> 00:14:58.040
team on what became [inaudible]

263
00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.040
. So I was actually, I had done protocol work at Silicon graphics with great 

264
00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.040
chess in a former

265
00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.040
 bell labs intern, grad student intern, who knew all the Unix founders and Greg was very interested in taking

266
00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.040
, um,  protocols to the next level with VLSI. Uh,

267
00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.040
cause he thought that CPS wouldn't wouldn't scale up

268
00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.040
, he was mistaken in that. Unfortunately Moore's law more than kept up and you have gigabit ethernet running with conventional processors. But I worked on protocols at 

269
00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.040
SGI

270
00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.040
, as well as Unix, kernel hacking and NFS and things like that. So I, I came into Netscape to work on the server side for a month, but I was, I was thinking the whole time, what should this language be like, should it be easy to use? Might it syntax even be more like natural language, like

271
00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.040
, um,

272
00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.040
 hyper talk, which is bill Atkinson's language. And HyperCard if you had ever

273
00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.040
used HyperCard on an early Mac. Uh,  and I thought, uh,

274
00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.040
 well, I'd like to do that. But my management saying

275
00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.873
, make it look like Java, which looks like C from a distance. Yeah.

276
00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.860
<v 2>What does that mean? Is it braces? We're talking about visually,</v>

277
00:15:59.861 --> 00:16:03.850
do you mean like a management? Do they understand what they do?

278
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:06.700
<v 1>No marketing didn't know, but, but management did like Rick shell,</v>

279
00:16:06.701 --> 00:16:11.080
the VP of engineering knew, and we had a plan even that was,

280
00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.400
if you have this companion language,

281
00:16:12.401 --> 00:16:15.130
you're going to glue things together between Java and JavaScript.

282
00:16:15.131 --> 00:16:19.480
So you're going to have commerce in memory, in the heap with data types.

283
00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.750
So you're going to want some of the data types in Java to reflect in the

284
00:16:22.751 --> 00:16:25.570
JavaScript. You're going to want the primitive types of the Java,

285
00:16:25.571 --> 00:16:26.950
unfortunately severed from objects.

286
00:16:26.951 --> 00:16:30.310
So at least some of them number don't double let's call it.

287
00:16:30.311 --> 00:16:34.660
And Java's terms from the C term for double precision floating point, um,

288
00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:38.110
or strings or booleans, um,

289
00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.600
and objects.

290
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:45.040
And so right away there was this constraint looking like Java I'm in

291
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.850
kind of a C curly brace syntax, but also some of the data types. Yeah.

292
00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:54.100
<v 2>Like objects and so on [inaudible] collection. Yeah.</v>

293
00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:57.100
<v 1>Uh, even the Bitwise operators in the shift operators,</v>

294
00:16:57.101 --> 00:17:00.070
including the unsigned right shift, which Java had,

295
00:17:00.071 --> 00:17:01.960
because it didn't have unsigned integer types.

296
00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.780
It's it said if you want to do onsite operations, use an operator.

297
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:07.780
And that turned out to be important much later I'll I'll tell that story five

298
00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:12.790
times, but, um, JavaScript inherited a set of, uh,

299
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.240
operators, the expression, grammar, the statement,

300
00:17:16.241 --> 00:17:20.170
grammar up to a point from Java, but I wanted a functional language.

301
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.270
I wanted scheme a little bit of scheme,

302
00:17:22.271 --> 00:17:24.040
even though it wasn't as clean as schema.

303
00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:27.610
<v 2>Well, you had to love Sergeant jobs. You had a love for scheme and list that,</v>

304
00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:29.350
that functional language landscape.

305
00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.100
<v 1>I wanted first class functions because I saw the need for callbacks in the</v>

306
00:17:33.101 --> 00:17:35.170
browser where it's a single threaded program.

307
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:38.110
All the early browsers are single-threaded and it's the right model for users.

308
00:17:38.111 --> 00:17:40.870
Most users weren't ready for mutual exclusion and threading.

309
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:44.890
So in a single threaded world, you cannot block these interface.

310
00:17:44.891 --> 00:17:49.060
So you have to use a callback and run later. And the, without getting too,

311
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.800
and trying to capture the continuation, like call CC does in scheme,

312
00:17:52.801 --> 00:17:56.850
I thought I'll just make it easy to have fun arcs first-class functions.

313
00:17:56.851 --> 00:18:00.720
You pass downward and it can call back. It'd be called back. Um,

314
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.660
and Java didn't have that at the time. It had,

315
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:07.860
it took forever to get proper first class functions Lambdas now into,

316
00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:09.810
into Java Java seven or eight. I think.

317
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.950
<v 2>It did have concurrency right from the very beginning.</v>

318
00:18:12.951 --> 00:18:17.180
But you were thinking that the JavaScript in the browser would not have the

319
00:18:17.181 --> 00:18:18.350
luxury of being okay.

320
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:21.980
<v 1>Correct. That's right. And the reason was Java was going to run into plugins.</v>

321
00:18:21.981 --> 00:18:24.020
We could fork threads and go, go to town.

322
00:18:24.021 --> 00:18:27.790
But the main action in the browser was in the single threaded programs,

323
00:18:27.791 --> 00:18:30.920
single units process on, on Unix or windows. Uh,

324
00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:34.760
and it was where you had to service the event loop and then go, you know,

325
00:18:34.761 --> 00:18:39.530
do things, respond to the network layout, some HTML render it, turn, you know,

326
00:18:39.531 --> 00:18:43.190
with Cinda Heights, by filling containers, boxes, uh, the early,

327
00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:47.240
what became the CSS box model, uh, and run scripts to, you know,

328
00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.780
make the thing livelier respond to user input. Uh,

329
00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:55.790
and all that event driven programming was in part like HyperCard because

330
00:18:55.791 --> 00:18:58.610
HyperCard had this on event names, syntax.

331
00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:02.120
And so that's why you have in JavaScript on click run together as the name of

332
00:19:02.121 --> 00:19:03.770
the event handler. Um,

333
00:19:03.771 --> 00:19:06.440
and there's some funny ones on mouse over and on mouse out.

334
00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:08.720
People still complain about those, but, you know, um,

335
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.030
there were many more events now over the years standardized,

336
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:15.050
but it was a mix of event driven single-threaded programming because it had to

337
00:19:15.051 --> 00:19:18.380
run in the main thread of the browser where the action is,

338
00:19:18.381 --> 00:19:19.880
and Java never got there,

339
00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:24.980
which meant Java could not interact easily or quickly or in a nested way with

340
00:19:24.981 --> 00:19:28.640
the document, with the objects reflected from the HTML document,

341
00:19:28.641 --> 00:19:31.540
with the tables and forms and so on. And that,

342
00:19:31.541 --> 00:19:34.700
that is one of the reasons I think JavaScript survived in Java kind of die.

343
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:38.170
Java was in this plugin prison essentially was confined to a rectangle,

344
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:41.900
the applet rectangle. And while we even built a next year,

345
00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:46.970
Nick Thompson friend from SGI who was an intern grad student at

346
00:19:46.971 --> 00:19:50.720
CMU at the time built the first version of live connect to glue Java and

347
00:19:50.721 --> 00:19:54.410
JavaScript together to deliver on that vision where you do have commerce between

348
00:19:54.411 --> 00:19:58.520
the data types and the heap, um, that it worked, it worked,

349
00:19:58.521 --> 00:20:00.680
but you were Java was in charge. Uh,

350
00:20:00.681 --> 00:20:03.050
JavaScript was in charge and Java was just these components.

351
00:20:03.051 --> 00:20:05.180
These helper augmenters, I'll do everything in JavaScript.

352
00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.370
And what happened over time, it's like an evolutionary filter.

353
00:20:07.371 --> 00:20:11.330
It just kind of who needs the plugin. And in fact, sun mismanaged,

354
00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.430
Java as a plugin, they thought, Oh,

355
00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.600
that scape for giving us the distribution vehicle.

356
00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.130
We don't care about the browser. It's just about getting jobs out there.

357
00:20:19.131 --> 00:20:20.690
And that was a big miscalculation.

358
00:20:20.691 --> 00:20:24.080
They then tried because Microsoft was killing Netscape after years,

359
00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.580
they tried getting into Microsoft.

360
00:20:25.581 --> 00:20:30.380
And you may remember there was a sun Microsoft deal, which famously blew up and,

361
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.280
and, uh, Microsoft kicked Java out of windows.

362
00:20:34.281 --> 00:20:35.870
And that's when they really pulled the trigger.

363
00:20:35.871 --> 00:20:38.330
I think they already evaluated it and liked it on Enders,

364
00:20:38.331 --> 00:20:43.310
helzberg.net and C-sharp and decided we're going to just not have Java.

365
00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:47.000
W w w we don't want any of that sun stuff. We don't want the patent risk.

366
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.540
We don't want, I'm not sure what the all fights were about.

367
00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:53.530
There was some patent angle to it, I think. And up till then,

368
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:58.060
Microsoft had been using Java components, like in outlook web access,

369
00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.540
which had a lot of JavaScript to be a web mail, like Hotmail,

370
00:21:01.541 --> 00:21:04.000
like user interface. They had to call the,

371
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:08.770
the mail server through a HDP and they, they use the, uh,

372
00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.940
Java object to do this. And when they gave the boot to sun,

373
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:14.920
they suddenly other, you know,

374
00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.710
the left-hand gave the boot and the right hand said,

375
00:21:17.711 --> 00:21:20.230
we better do something else in outlook, web access, what are we going to do?

376
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.630
And they said, let's just add an active X component,

377
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.380
which is their own native way of embedding things in languages.

378
00:21:26.381 --> 00:21:28.120
And we'll make it, uh,

379
00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.450
it'll be what became XML HTTP request,

380
00:21:31.451 --> 00:21:34.150
which is now a web standard for calling asynchronously.

381
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:38.320
And it's been replaced by the fetch API in HTML five race, you know,

382
00:21:38.321 --> 00:21:41.500
living document. But this whole lineage goes back to, uh,

383
00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.110
Java being successively, the loser and getting kicked out.

384
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.140
And after Microsoft kicked it out, it was a plugin.

385
00:21:47.141 --> 00:21:50.710
And you would find it required for like smart card banking in,

386
00:21:50.711 --> 00:21:54.130
in the Nordic countries where that was mandated by law,

387
00:21:54.131 --> 00:21:56.350
but really didn't get used much. Or, you know,

388
00:21:56.351 --> 00:22:00.340
there were pilots who used it for, um, flight information. Um,

389
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.600
but flash which Netscape could have bought, but fortunately it didn't.

390
00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.500
<v 2>Generally we would have screwed it up. I mean,</v>

391
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.630
what year are we talking about with flashpoint after.

392
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:11.850
<v 1>The IPO? So it was probably late 95 and.</v>

393
00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:14.130
<v 2>Flash was around. Was it Adobe? No, it wasn't.</v>

394
00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:18.150
<v 1>Oh, future splash. And it was a, these brothers, Jonathan Gay,</v>

395
00:22:18.151 --> 00:22:20.370
I think his name was, and he, he, uh,

396
00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:24.840
came knocking and the marketing guy at Netscape who was screening the technology

397
00:22:24.841 --> 00:22:27.240
partners, or want to be acquisitions was brutal.

398
00:22:27.241 --> 00:22:29.730
And just everybody wanted to get it on the Netscape, you know,

399
00:22:29.731 --> 00:22:30.570
stock gravy train.

400
00:22:30.571 --> 00:22:34.710
And he sent them packing and they ended up selling the macro media and

401
00:22:34.711 --> 00:22:36.690
Macromedia was where flash was created.

402
00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:41.430
And the good thing about Macromedia was it was a, um, tool company.

403
00:22:41.431 --> 00:22:45.000
So invested in, you know, the best ideas.

404
00:22:45.001 --> 00:22:49.680
I think what you're still somewhat lost to us, a flash, the timeline animation,

405
00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.710
this sort of an immutable function, uh, over time.

406
00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.530
<v 2>They had the tooling around that too. Like that dream Weaver,</v>

407
00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.130
there's a flash watch the director. There were a bunch of them. Yeah. I mean,

408
00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:00.600
yeah, that was a flashback.

409
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:04.970
<v 1>It was one of the last ones. These tools were used by real artists and,</v>

410
00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:06.660
you know, special effects people and designers,

411
00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:11.700
all the restaurant websites around 2005 were done in flash, which was, you know,

412
00:23:11.701 --> 00:23:14.520
we were trying to do HTML five at the same time. That was the Firefox era.

413
00:23:14.521 --> 00:23:17.970
We were trying to make the web capable enough. You didn't need flash,

414
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.190
but if you recall, you go to a restaurant it's like,

415
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:21.810
this is kind of like a game or something.

416
00:23:21.811 --> 00:23:23.880
It's like a flash or the font looks small.

417
00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.070
<v 2>He didn't like flash from the beginning. Get I could, this is,</v>

418
00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:26.970
this doesn't feel right.

419
00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:31.140
<v 1>I actually admire Flash's technology. I'm pretty pragmatic about these things.</v>

420
00:23:31.141 --> 00:23:35.910
And I realized that, you know, it doesn't matter if you're dealt a bad hand,

421
00:23:35.911 --> 00:23:37.410
like JavaScript was a rush job.

422
00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:41.700
Or if you have flash as a plugin and you can invest in the tools and make it

423
00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:45.150
pretty good, uh, you should, you should make it better for your users,

424
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:46.370
grow it as best you can.

425
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:50.780
And what happened with the browser due to Microsoft monopoly abuse for which

426
00:23:50.781 --> 00:23:54.530
they were convicted. And, you know, um, even after that,

427
00:23:54.531 --> 00:23:58.130
until I think Firefox, and then Chrome was people kept saying, Oh,

428
00:23:58.131 --> 00:24:01.730
the web can't do X. It can't do, Y we'll have to have a plugin.

429
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:03.410
We'll have to have a new approach. Well,

430
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:08.390
w w we'll clean the slate and have a new web. And everyone has said that failed.

431
00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:11.810
And the reason they failed is because there's too much value in the web,

432
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.130
this huge network.

433
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:17.330
And the worst is better principle means that you can not only start bad,

434
00:24:17.331 --> 00:24:21.350
which they all sneer at, but get on first and get wide distribution,

435
00:24:21.351 --> 00:24:26.180
get sort of evolutionary advantage in priority of place,

436
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:30.530
but you can also improve it over time. And so if you're going to improve flash,

437
00:24:30.531 --> 00:24:32.480
and for some reason, flash is now out of favor,

438
00:24:32.481 --> 00:24:34.450
Steve jobs said you can't have flash on the iPhone.

439
00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:37.550
That was probably the death nail, put your energy into JavaScript.

440
00:24:37.551 --> 00:24:41.900
And that happened, right? So we, we did things at Mozilla with Adobe to improve,

441
00:24:41.901 --> 00:24:45.290
which bought my Macromedia to improve flash and to improve the version of

442
00:24:45.291 --> 00:24:48.290
JavaScript that was in flash. And we tried to standardize that.
