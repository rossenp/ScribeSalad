00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.980
<v 0>So we talked a little bit about the Soviet union and I happened to have lived</v>

2
00:00:06.981 --> 00:00:08.380
through the collapse of the Soviet union.

3
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.380
And so what are the factors,

4
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.980
the causes in your mind to why the Soviet union

5
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.163
collapsed?

6
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.050
<v 1>So I, you know, definitely a multivariate situation.</v>

7
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.770
I think there's a lot of factors. Um,

8
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.490
one that jumped out to me recently, again,

9
00:00:30.491 --> 00:00:32.690
from that documentary that I didn't note before,

10
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.170
was that at one point Stalin eliminated,

11
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.610
I think 75% of his intelligence force. Hmm. Um,

12
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.360
which I think when you're competing with another nation state, you know,

13
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.960
and intelligence and cover operations are very integral to your survival.

14
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.360
<v 2>I think that was a, uh, definitely a shot in the foot,</v>

15
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.080
but at a higher level,

16
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.800
I would say that capitalism and communism were each

17
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.230
resource Strat of the 20th century nation state. Um,

18
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.710
and they seem, you know, we commonly consider them to be diametrically opposed,

19
00:01:12.711 --> 00:01:15.110
but there's actually a lot of commonality between the two.

20
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.990
The difference would be that in Soviet Russia,

21
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.550
as we alluded to earlier, they tried to completely replace price signals

22
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.100
with this nationalistic faith and devotion.

23
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.860
<v 1>So it mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; it, they removed the economic nerve signal,</v>

24
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:34.660
which coordinated the allocation of capital over time.

25
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.100
So this inhibited their ability to generate wealth.

26
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.340
Whereas in the United States,

27
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.100
we left most markets open to free enterprise. So we,

28
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.970
we honored the integrity of price signals and we allowed people to

29
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.650
trade and accumulate wealth. Um,

30
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.810
so in every market, except the market for money,

31
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.810
both markets maintained essential bank as we, as we've gotten to. So

32
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.290
I think in a really big picture standpoint, that's why

33
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.640
capitalism out competes communism is because it is able to generate

34
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.480
more wealth than communism was.

35
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.200
And therefore was able to put financial pressure on the USS R until

36
00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:20.280
it reached the point of bankruptcy.

37
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.200
Essentially this a similar model I would argue

38
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.750
is that for the same reasons we saw

39
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.630
capitalism out compete communism, which I think at the, the,

40
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.790
the data that I recall was that the USS R's economy was valued

41
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.990
at close to one third of its inputs.

42
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.030
So if you just didn't do anything inside the USSR and just sold all the raw

43
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.310
materials that were going into it,

44
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.780
it would've been worth three times as much as sending the materials in,

45
00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:53.860
running it through the efforts and then shipping things back out, it was,

46
00:02:53.861 --> 00:02:58.180
it was value destructive versus value creative. And I would argue,

47
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.280
this is because again, the,

48
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.120
the centralized computing model versus decentralized computing model,

49
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.280
it just became more and more corrupt over time. Um,

50
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.280
it got to the point where I think most of the occupations in USSR towards the

51
00:03:13.281 --> 00:03:17.800
end were as informants, right? They were working for the state. Um,

52
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.790
drew Peterson makes this point too,

53
00:03:19.791 --> 00:03:23.430
that at some point it was actually illegal to be sad in Soviet Russia,

54
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.430
because if you were sad,

55
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.870
you were contradicting the utopian view of the state. So if you were sad,

56
00:03:30.871 --> 00:03:32.510
you're implying the state's not doing something wrong.
