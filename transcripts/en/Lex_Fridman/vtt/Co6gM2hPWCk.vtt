00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.470
<v 0>You were, or you worked in a bunch of companies, uh,</v>

2
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.860
you let a lot of amazing teams. Um,

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.510
I don't ha I'm not sure if you've ever been like in the early stages of a

4
00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:19.260
startup, but do you have advice for,

5
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.160
uh, somebody that wants to, uh,

6
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.020
do a startup or build a company like build a strong team of engineers that are

7
00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:32.550
passionate and just want to, um, solve a big problem? Like,

8
00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:35.520
is there a more specifically on that point?

9
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.820
<v 1>Well, you have to be really good at stuff.</v>

10
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.400
If you're going to lead and build a team,

11
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.190
you better be really interested in how people work and think.

12
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.540
<v 0>PayPal or the solution to the problem. So there's two things, right?</v>

13
00:00:47.541 --> 00:00:49.610
One is how people work and the other is.

14
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.000
<v 1>That's actually, there's, there's quite a few successful startups.</v>

15
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.220
So it's pretty clear. The founders don't know anything about people.

16
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.340
Like the idea was so powerful, that approach for a problem.

17
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.560
But I suspect somewhere early, they hired some people who understood people,

18
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.040
cause people really need a lot of care and feeding, collaborate,

19
00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:11.690
and work together and feel engaged and work hard, you know, like startup.

20
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.730
So it was all about producing other people.

21
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.560
Like you're nimble because you don't have any legacy. You don't have, you know,

22
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.090
a bunch of people who are depressed about life, you know, just showing up know.

23
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.160
So startups have a lot of advantages that way.

24
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.910
<v 0>Do you like the Steve jobs talked about this idea of a players and B</v>

25
00:01:31.911 --> 00:01:34.820
players? I don't know if you know this formulation.

26
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.560
<v 1>Now, um, that,</v>

27
00:01:36.561 --> 00:01:40.640
that organizations that get taken over by P B player leaders

28
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.390
often really underperformed.

29
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.210
There are so few players that said in big organizations,

30
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.880
there's so much work to do. Like,

31
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.250
and there's so many people are happy to do what, you know,

32
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.380
like the leadership or the big idea.

33
00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:59.180
People can see it consider menial jobs and you know, you need a place for them,

34
00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:03.140
but you need an organization that both values and rewards them,

35
00:02:03.141 --> 00:02:05.240
but doesn't let them take over the leadership of it.

36
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.290
<v 0>Got it. But, so, so you need to have an organization that's resistant to that,</v>

37
00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:13.180
but in the early days, the notion with,

38
00:02:13.181 --> 00:02:18.140
with Steve was that like one B player in a room of a players will

39
00:02:18.141 --> 00:02:19.880
be like destructive to the whole.

40
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.920
<v 1>I've seen that happen. I don't know if it's like always true. Like,</v>

41
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.650
you know, you, you run into people who are clearly B players,

42
00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:28.820
but they think they're very players.

43
00:02:28.821 --> 00:02:31.790
And so they have a loud voice at the table and they make lots of demands for

44
00:02:31.791 --> 00:02:34.190
that. But there's other people that are like, I know who I am.

45
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.180
I just want to work with cool people on cool and just told me what to do and

46
00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:40.940
I'll go get it done. You know? So you have to, again,

47
00:02:40.941 --> 00:02:45.050
this is like people skills, like what kind of person has it? You know,

48
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.330
I've met some really great people.

49
00:02:47.331 --> 00:02:50.130
I love working with you that weren't the biggest ID people,

50
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.960
their most productive ever, but they show up, they get it done. You know, they,

51
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.870
they create connection and community that people value.

52
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.610
It's pretty diverse. So I don't think there's a recipe for that.
