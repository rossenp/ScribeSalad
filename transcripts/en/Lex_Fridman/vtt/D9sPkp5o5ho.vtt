00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.240
<v 0>Is strength theory, really the answer. Where do you fall on this? Like,</v>

2
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.680
how do you make sense of this puzzle? Why do you think it has fallen out.

3
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.960
<v 1>Of favor? Yeah, so I don't, I would actually challenge the statement.</v>

4
00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:15.440
That's fallen out of favor.

5
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.400
I would say that any field of research when it's new and

6
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.680
it's the, the bright,

7
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.270
any bicycle that no one has yet seen on that block. Yeah.

8
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:29.630
It's gonna attract attention and, uh,

9
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.830
the news outlets are gonna cover it and students are gonna flock to it. Sure.

10
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.430
But as a, as a field matures,

11
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.830
it does shed those qualities because it's no longer as novel as it

12
00:00:42.831 --> 00:00:45.820
was when it was, is first introduced 30, 40 years ago.

13
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.740
But you need to judge it by a different standard. You need to judge it by,

14
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.140
is it making progress on foundational issues,

15
00:00:54.141 --> 00:00:57.100
deepening our understanding of the subject. And by that measure,

16
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.900
string theory is, is, is scoring very high.

17
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.530
Now at the same time you to need to judge whether it makes contact with

18
00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:09.610
experiment as we discussed before, too. And in that measure,

19
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.930
we're still challenged. So I would say that many strength,

20
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.450
the myself included are,

21
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.250
are very sober about the theory. It,

22
00:01:21.251 --> 00:01:26.160
it has the tremendous progress that it had 34 years ago that hasn't gone away,

23
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.720
but we've become better equipped at assessing

24
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.880
the long journey ahead.

25
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.280
And that was something that we weren't particularly good at back say in the

26
00:01:37.281 --> 00:01:39.960
eighties, look, when I was just starting out in the field,

27
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.960
there was a sense of physics is about to end

28
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.270
string theory is about to be the be and all final unified theory.

29
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.590
And that will bring this chapter to a close. Now I have to say,

30
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.550
I think it was more the younger physicists who were saying that some of the more

31
00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:00.990
seasoned, even if they were pro string theory at the time,

32
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.430
I don't know if they were rolling their eyes, but they knew, yeah,

33
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.180
it was gonna be a long, long journey. I think people like, you know,

34
00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:11.900
John Schwartz, one of the founders of strength theory, Michael Green,

35
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.700
no relation to me, founders of the theory, uh, Edward Whitten, you know,

36
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.740
one of the main people drive in the theory back then,

37
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.620
and today I think they knew that we were in for a long

38
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.260
haul. And,

39
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.450
and that's the nature of science quick hits that resolve everything few

40
00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:31.650
and far between.

41
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.770
And so if you were in for the quick

42
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.970
solution to the big questions of the world, then you would've been disappointed.

43
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.530
And I think there were people who were disappointed and moved on and work on

44
00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:46.880
other subjects. If you were in, in,

45
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.520
in the way that Einstein was in for a lifetime of investigation,

46
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.240
to try to see where, what the answers to the deep questions would be.

47
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.240
Then I think strength theory has been a rich source of,

48
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.600
of material that has kept so many people deeply engaged in moving

49
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.880
the frontier forward.

50
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.480
<v 0>There's a few qualities about strength theory, which are weird. I mean,</v>

51
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.040
a lot of physics is just weird and beautiful. So let me ask the question.

52
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.790
What do you as most beautiful about in.

53
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.830
<v 1>Theory? Well, but, uh,</v>

54
00:03:19.831 --> 00:03:24.390
what attracted me to the theory at the outset beyond

55
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.430
it's putting gravity and quantum mechanics together, which I think is, um,

56
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.150
it's true claim to fame, at least on paper, it's able to do that.

57
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.950
What attracted me to theory was the fact that it requires extra dimensions of

58
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:36.830
space mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

59
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.860
And this was an idea that intrigued me in a,

60
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:45.860
in a very deep way, even before I really understood what it meant.

61
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.740
I somehow had. I mean,

62
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.540
talk about sort of the emotional part of consciousness and the cognitive part in

63
00:03:53.541 --> 00:03:56.980
some, perhaps you call it strange in some strange, emotional way.

64
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.410
I was enamored with, with Einstein's general relativity,

65
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.410
the idea of curve space and time before I really knew what it meant.

66
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.890
It just spoke to me. I don't know how else to say it mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

67
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.210
And then when I subsequently learned that people had thought about

68
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.370
more dimensions of space than we can see and how those extra dimensions would be

69
00:04:19.371 --> 00:04:23.800
vital to a deep understanding of the things that we do see in this world, 4, 5,

70
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.120
6 dimensions might explain why there are certain forces and particles and how

71
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:32.200
they behave to me. This was like amazing, totally amazing.

72
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.480
And then when I learned that strength theory embraced all these ideas,

73
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.400
embraced the general theory of relativity embraced quantum acts embraced the PO

74
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.790
stability of extra dimensions. Then I was then I was hooked.

75
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.790
And so when I was a graduate student, we would just spend hours. Uh,

76
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.190
we, I mean, a couple of other graduate students and myself who had a,

77
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.350
have sort of worked really well together. So at Oxford and England, we would,

78
00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.950
we would work these enormous numbers of hours a day,

79
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:03.780
trying to understand the shapes of these extra dimensions, the geometry of them,

80
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.900
what those geometrical shapes for the extra dimensions would imply for things

81
00:05:07.901 --> 00:05:10.540
that we see in the world around us. And it was a,

82
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.020
it was a heady heady time and,

83
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.140
and that kind of excitement has sort of filtered through over the decades.

84
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.420
But I'd say that's really the,

85
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.090
the part of the theory that I think really hooked me most strongly.
