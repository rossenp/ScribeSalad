00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.420
<v 0>I have to ask about April, 2012, when, uh, Instagram,</v>

2
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.340
along with his massive employee base of 13,

3
00:00:12.341 --> 00:00:15.700
people was sold to Facebook for $1 billion.

4
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.590
What was the process like on a business level engineering level, human level?

5
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.040
What was that process of selling to Facebook? Like what did it feel?

6
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.010
<v 1>So I want to provide some context, which is,</v>

7
00:00:27.011 --> 00:00:30.910
I worked in corporate development at Google, um, which not a lot of people know,

8
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.330
but corporate development is effectively the group that buys companies, right.

9
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.520
You sit there and you acquire companies.

10
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.300
And I had sat through so many of these meetings with entrepreneurs.

11
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.590
We actually fun fact,

12
00:00:41.591 --> 00:00:44.230
we never acquired a single company when I worked in corporate development.

13
00:00:44.231 --> 00:00:48.970
So I can't claim that, um, I had like a lot of experience, um,

14
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.270
but I had enough experience to understand, okay,

15
00:00:52.271 --> 00:00:56.110
like what prices are people getting? And what's the process. And,

16
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.040
and as we started to grow, you know,

17
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.180
we were trying to keep this thing running and we were exhausted and we're 13

18
00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:06.850
people. And I mean, we were trying to think back,

19
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.740
it was probably 27, 37 now. Um,

20
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.180
so young and w on a relative basis. Right.

21
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.960
And, uh, we're trying to keep the thing running. And then, you know,

22
00:01:19.961 --> 00:01:24.790
we go out to raise money and we're kind of like the hot startup at the

23
00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:29.410
time. And I remember going into a specific VC and saying our terms,

24
00:01:29.411 --> 00:01:32.830
we're looking for, we're looking for a $500 million valuation,

25
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.200
and I've never seen so many jobs drop all in unison. Right.

26
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.940
And I was like thanked and walked out the door very kindly after. Um,

27
00:01:42.941 --> 00:01:45.070
and then I got a call the next day, uh,

28
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.980
from someone who was connected to them and said, they said,

29
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.410
we just want to let you know that, like, uh,

30
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.500
it was pretty offensive that you asked for $500 billion valuation.

31
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.540
I can't tell if that was, um,

32
00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.940
like just negotiating or what, but it's true. Like no one offered us more.

33
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.920
Right. So can you clarify.

34
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.790
<v 0>The, the number again? He said, how many million? 550.</v>

35
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.890
<v 1>100 Million. 500 million. Half a billion. Yeah. Um, so in my mind,</v>

36
00:02:11.891 --> 00:02:13.780
I'm anchored like, okay, well literally,

37
00:02:13.781 --> 00:02:18.430
no one's biting at 500 million and eventually we would get Sequoia and

38
00:02:18.431 --> 00:02:22.900
Greylock and others together at 500 million basically, uh, post, uh,

39
00:02:22.901 --> 00:02:25.870
it was 450 pre I think we raised $50 million,

40
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.480
but just like no one was used to seeing a $500 million companies then, like,

41
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.460
I don't know if it was because we were just coming out of the hangover 2008 and

42
00:02:36.461 --> 00:02:39.880
things were still on recovery, um, mode. Uh,

43
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.350
but then along comes Facebook and after some

44
00:02:44.351 --> 00:02:45.460
negotiation,

45
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.890
we've two X the number from half a billion to a billion. Good.

46
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.370
It seems pretty good, you know? And, uh,

47
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.600
I think mark and I really saw eye to eye that this thing could be big. Um,

48
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.980
we thought could their resources would help us scale it. And in a lot of ways,

49
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:04.750
it de-risks. I mean,

50
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.720
it's a reason a lot of the employees lives for the rest of their lives,

51
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.900
including me, including Mike. Right. Um,

52
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.140
think I might've had like 10 grand in my bank account at the time. Right?

53
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:19.030
Like we're working hard. We had nothing. Um, so on a relative basis,

54
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.800
that seems very high.

55
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:24.730
And then I think the last company to exit for anywhere close to a billion was

56
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:27.820
YouTube that I could think of. And, uh,

57
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.800
and thus began the giant long bull run of 2012 to the way all the way

58
00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:34.690
to where we are now, where, um,

59
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.610
I saw some stat yesterday about like how many unicorns exist and it's absurd,

60
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.230
but then again,

61
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.210
never underestimate technology and like the value it can provide and man costs

62
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:50.980
have dropped and man scale has increased and you can make businesses make a

63
00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:55.330
lot of money now, but on a, on a fundamental level, I don't know,

64
00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:59.950
like how do you describe the decision to sell a company with 13

65
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:01.480
people for a billion dollars?

66
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.910
<v 0>Like how did it take a lot of guts to set a table and say</v>

67
00:04:06.911 --> 00:04:10.240
500 million or 1 billion with mark Zuckerberg?

68
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.530
It seems like a very large number with 13. Like, especially.

69
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.560
<v 1>Like, it doesn't seem, it is, it is all large.</v>

70
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.880
<v 0>Especially like you said before the unicorn</v>

71
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.583
parade.

72
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.150
<v 1>I like that. I'm going to use that, right? Yeah. The, uh, the, the,</v>

73
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.210
the head of the unicorn parade, it's the, uh, yeah,

74
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.240
it's a massive unicorn parade. Um, okay. So,

75
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.990
no, I mean, we knew we were worth quote-unquote a lot, but we didn't. I mean,

76
00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:44.290
there was no market for Instagram. I mean, it's not, you could mark you,

77
00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:46.510
couldn't mark to market this thing in the public markets.

78
00:04:46.511 --> 00:04:50.800
You didn't quite understand what it would be worth or was worth at the time.

79
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.323
So in a market,

80
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.420
an illiquid market where you have one buyer and one seller and you're going back

81
00:04:55.421 --> 00:04:57.340
and forth, and, well,

82
00:04:57.341 --> 00:05:01.720
I guess there were like VC firms who were willing to, you know,

83
00:05:01.721 --> 00:05:05.680
invest at a certain valuation. So I don't know,

84
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:10.540
you just go with your gut. And, uh, and at the end of the day, I would say, um,

85
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.720
the hardest part of it was not realizing,

86
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.243
uh,

87
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.320
like when we sold it was tough because like literally everywhere I go

88
00:05:23.321 --> 00:05:27.490
restaurants, whatever, like for a good six months after,

89
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.570
it was a lot of attention on the deal. A lot of attention on the product,

90
00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:35.530
a lot of attention, it was kind of miserable. Right. And you're like, wait,

91
00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:38.710
like I made a lot of money, but like, why is this not great?

92
00:05:38.711 --> 00:05:43.480
And it's because it turns out, you know, and I don't, I don't know, like,

93
00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:44.770
I don't really keep in touch with mark,

94
00:05:44.771 --> 00:05:48.100
but I've got to assume his job right now is not exactly the most happy job in

95
00:05:48.101 --> 00:05:50.200
the world. It's really tough when you're on top.

96
00:05:50.201 --> 00:05:52.420
And it's really tough when you're in the limelight.

97
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.980
So the decision itself was like, oh, cool. This is great. How lucky are we?

98
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.770
Right.

99
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.190
<v 0>So, okay. There's a million questions I want to ask. First of all, first of all,</v>

100
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:02.743
why,

101
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.140
why is it hard to be on top of why did you not feel good? Like, can,

102
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.640
can you dig into that? It always, um,

103
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.450
I've heard like Olympic athletes say, after they win gold, they,

104
00:06:15.451 --> 00:06:16.580
they get depressed.

105
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.850
Is it something like that where it feels like it was kind

106
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.370
of like a thing you were working towards some,

107
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.110
some loose definition of success and this sure site feels like, uh,

108
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.350
at least according to other startups, this is what success looks like.

109
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:37.670
And now why don't I feel any better? I'm still human.

110
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:40.040
I still all the same problems. Is that the nature?

111
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.670
Or is it just like negative attention of some kind? What?

112
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.620
<v 1>I think it's all of the above. Um, but to be clear,</v>

113
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.550
there was a lot of happiness in terms of like, oh my God, this is great. Like,

114
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.140
we like won the super bowl of startups. Right. Um,

115
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.820
anyone who can get to a liquidity event of anything meaningful

116
00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:01.670
feels like, wow, this is what we started out to do. Of course,

117
00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:05.300
we want to create great things that people love. But, um,

118
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.070
like we won in a big way, but yeah, there's this big like, oh, if we won,

119
00:07:10.071 --> 00:07:13.970
what is like, what's next? I don't. So they call it the,

120
00:07:13.971 --> 00:07:16.610
we have arrived syndrome, um,

121
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.170
which I need to go back and look where I can quote that from.

122
00:07:21.171 --> 00:07:23.240
But I remember reading about it at the time. And I was like, oh yeah,

123
00:07:23.241 --> 00:07:24.074
that's that?

124
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:28.220
And I remember we had a product manager leave very early on when we got to

125
00:07:28.221 --> 00:07:30.230
Facebook. And he said to me, um,

126
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.130
I just don't believe I can learn anything at this company anymore. It's like,

127
00:07:34.131 --> 00:07:38.030
it's hit its apex. We sold it. Great.

128
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:42.410
I just don't have anything else to learn. So from 2012,

129
00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:44.450
all the way to the day I left in 2018,

130
00:07:44.451 --> 00:07:48.980
like the amount I learned and the humility with which I realized, oh,

131
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.580
we thought we, $1 billion is cool, but like,

132
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.180
there are a hundred billion dollar companies. And by the way, on top of that,

133
00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:59.720
we had no revenue. We had, I mean, we had a cool product,

134
00:07:59.721 --> 00:08:04.580
but we didn't scale it yet. And there's so much to learn. And then competitors.

135
00:08:04.581 --> 00:08:07.940
And how fun was it to fight Snapchat? Oh my God. Like it was,

136
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:13.310
it's like Yankees red Sox. It's great. Like that's what you live for. Um,

137
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.510
you know, you win some, you lose some, but, uh,

138
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.570
the amount you can learn through that process, uh,

139
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:25.310
what I've realized in life is that there is no,

140
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.080
and there's always someone who has more,

141
00:08:27.081 --> 00:08:31.700
there's always more challenge just at different scales. And, uh,

142
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.130
it sounds a, like a little Buddhist, but, um,

143
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.030
everything is super challenging.

144
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:42.320
Whether you're like a small business or an enormous business, I say like,

145
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.140
choose the game you like to play. Right.

146
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:48.110
You've got to imagine that if you're an amazing basketball player,

147
00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:51.200
you enjoy to some extent practicing basketball,

148
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.140
it's gotta be something you love. It's going to suck. It's going to be hard.

149
00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:56.790
You're gonna have injuries. Right. But you got to love it.

150
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:00.750
And the same thing with Instagram, which is, um,

151
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:05.430
we might've sold, but it was like, great. There's one super bowl title.

152
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:10.200
Can we went five? What else can we do now? I imagine you didn't ask this,

153
00:09:10.201 --> 00:09:15.000
but okay. So I left, there's a little bit of like, what do you do next?

154
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.630
Right? Like what do you, how do you top that thing? It's the wrong question.

155
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.410
The question is like, when you wake up every day, what is the hardest,

156
00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:26.670
most interesting thing you can go work on? Because like at the end of the day,

157
00:09:26.671 --> 00:09:30.840
we all turn into dirt. It doesn't matter. Right. But what does matter is like,

158
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:35.850
can we really enjoy this life? Not in a hedonistic way, because that's,

159
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.280
it's like the reinforcement learning,

160
00:09:38.281 --> 00:09:41.190
learning like short term for as longterm objectives.

161
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:46.980
Can you wake up everyday and truly enjoy what you're doing? Um,

162
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.420
knowing that it's going to be painful, knowing that like,

163
00:09:51.421 --> 00:09:53.970
no matter what you choose, it's going to be painful. Um,

164
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.500
whether you sit on a beach or whether you manage a thousand people or 10,000,

165
00:09:58.501 --> 00:10:02.670
it's going to be painful. So choose something. That's fun to have pain.

166
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:08.070
Um, but yes, there was a, there was a lot of, we have arrived and, um,

167
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.810
it's a maturation process. You just have to go through.

168
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.590
<v 0>No matter how much success is, there is how much money you make.</v>

169
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.740
You have to wake up the next day and choose the hard life.

170
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:24.510
Whatever that means next. That's fun. The fun slash hard life. Well hard life.

171
00:10:24.511 --> 00:10:25.590
That's fun. I guess.

172
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.830
<v 1>What I'm trying to say is slightly different,</v>

173
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:33.090
which is just that no one realizes everything's going to be hard.

174
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:38.430
Even chilling out is hard. And then you just start worrying about stupid stuff.

175
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.840
Like, I don't know, like, did so-and-so forget to paint the house today?

176
00:10:42.841 --> 00:10:46.050
Or like, did the gardener come or whatever, like, or, oh,

177
00:10:46.051 --> 00:10:47.430
I'm so angry in my shipment,

178
00:10:47.431 --> 00:10:50.640
a wine didn't show up and I'm sitting here on the beach without my wine.

179
00:10:50.641 --> 00:10:52.440
I don't know. I'm making up now, but like.

180
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.460
<v 0>It turns out that even chilling, AKA meditation is hard work. Yeah.</v>

181
00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.490
<v 1>And at least meditation is like productive, chilling,</v>

182
00:10:59.491 --> 00:11:02.100
where you're like actually training yourself to calm down and be,

183
00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.760
but backing up for a moment. Everything's hard.

184
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.480
You might as well be like playing the game. You love to play.

185
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:13.950
I just like playing and winning and, and I'm,

186
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.860
I'm on the, on the, I'm still on the,

187
00:11:16.861 --> 00:11:19.620
I think the first half of life knock on wood. Um,

188
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.160
and I've got a lot of years and what am I going to do? Sit around.

189
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.730
And the other way of looking at this, by the way, um,

190
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.090
imagine you made one movie and it was great.

191
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:35.400
Would you just like stop making movies now? Generally you're like, wow.

192
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.850
I really like making movies. Let's make another one a lot of times, by the way,

193
00:11:38.851 --> 00:11:41.880
the second one or the third one, not that great, but the fourth one. Awesome.

194
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.600
And no one forgets the sec or everyone forgets the second and the third one.

195
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:50.730
So there's just this constant process of like, can I produce?

196
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.830
And is that fun? Is that exciting? What else can I learn?

197
00:11:53.831 --> 00:11:58.510
So this machine learning stuff for me has been this awesome new chapter of being

198
00:11:58.511 --> 00:12:02.140
like, man, that's something I didn't understand at all.

199
00:12:02.141 --> 00:12:04.810
And now I feel like I'm one 10th of the way there.

200
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.600
And that feels like a big mountain to climb.
