1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.340
<v 0>So you have quite a bit of experience, first of all,</v>

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.480
starting a company yourself, but also I saw maybe you can correct me,

3
00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:14.070
but you have a quite, quite a bit of knowledge of, um, just the,

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.551
in general,

5
00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:18.630
the startup experience of building companies that you've interacted with people.

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.190
W is there,

7
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.770
is there advice that you can give to somebody to found a co-founder

8
00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:30.660
who wants to launch and grow a new company and do

9
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.240
something big and impactful in this world?

10
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.710
<v 1>Yes. Uh, I would say, you know, like I mentioned earlier,</v>

11
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.720
but make sure the vision is something that, you know,

12
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.480
will get you out of bed in the morning and, and we'll get,

13
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.940
and that you can rally other people around you to, to achieve.

14
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.480
Uh,

15
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.400
cause I see a lot of folks that sort of cared about something or

16
00:00:58.401 --> 00:01:02.390
saw a window of opportunity to do something and, you know,

17
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.130
startups are hard and, and more often than not just being opportunistic,

18
00:01:07.131 --> 00:01:11.150
isn't going to be enough to make it through all the really crappy

19
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.100
things that are going to happen.

20
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.540
<v 0>So the vision just helps you psychologically to carry through the hardships,</v>

21
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.410
the you and the team.

22
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.570
<v 1>Yeah. You and the team. Yeah, exactly.</v>

23
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.100
To kind of younger people interested in getting into entrepreneurship,

24
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.210
I would say, you know,

25
00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:31.160
stay as close to like first principles and fundamentals as you

26
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:33.620
can for as long as you can. Um,

27
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.830
because really understanding the problems, you know,

28
00:01:36.831 --> 00:01:41.600
if it's something scientific or hardware related or, um, even if it's not,

29
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.820
but having a deep understanding of,

30
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.470
of the problem and the customers and what people care about and um,

31
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.970
how to move something forward is more important than taking all of the

32
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.830
entrepreneurship classes in undergrad. So being able to think deeply.

33
00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.270
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

34
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.770
<v 0>Yeah. Well, have you been surprised about how much like pivoting is involved?</v>

35
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.820
Like basically rethinking what you thought initially would be the right

36
00:02:07.821 --> 00:02:12.170
direction to go or is there accusing deeply enough that, uh,

37
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.990
you can stick in the same direction for long enough?

38
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.520
<v 1>So our, you know,</v>

39
00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:21.080
our guiding star hasn't changed at all. Um,

40
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.010
so that's been pretty consistent, but we, within that,

41
00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:29.720
we flip-flop on so many things, um, all the time. And, you know,

42
00:02:29.721 --> 00:02:30.890
to give you one example,

43
00:02:30.891 --> 00:02:35.510
it's do you stop and build a first product that's

44
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.990
well suited to maybe a smaller,

45
00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:43.730
less exciting segment of the market or do you stay head

46
00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:45.920
down and focus on, you know,

47
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.150
the big swing and trying to hit it out of the park right away.

48
00:02:50.151 --> 00:02:52.400
And we've flipped flop between that.

49
00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:56.900
And there's not a blanket answer and there are a lot of factors, but,

50
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.250
um, that's a hard one. And I think one,

51
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.150
one other piece for the aspiring founder,

52
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.550
I'm spending a lot of time and effort on the culture

53
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:14.050
and people piece is so important and is always an

54
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.760
afterthought and something that I

55
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:21.580
haven't really seen, like the founders or,

56
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.160
or executives that companies purposefully carve out time and

57
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.520
acknowledge that, yes,

58
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:31.810
this is going to take a lot of my time and resources and then,

59
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.990
but you'd see them after the fact trying to repair the, you know,

60
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.070
bro culture or whatever else is broken at the company. Um,

61
00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:41.230
and I think that it's starting to change. Um,

62
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.450
but just to be aware of it from the beginning.

63
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.880
<v 0>Right.</v>

64
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.330
I guess it should be part of the vision of what kind of place you want to create

65
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.040
or what kind of like human beings.

66
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.280
<v 1>Yeah, exactly. Like you can't wait five,</v>

67
00:03:56.281 --> 00:03:59.940
10 years and then just slap an HR person on to trying to fix it.

68
00:03:59.941 --> 00:04:01.890
Like it has to be thoughtful from the beginning.

69
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.610
<v 0>Yeah. Um, don't get me started in HR people.</v>

70
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.370
Uh, don't leave HR to HR people, but I'll just leave it at that.

71
00:04:11.371 --> 00:04:15.240
You didn't say that. I said, okay. Uh, yeah,

72
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.840
HR is actual HR is really important as is so

73
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.830
culture support. Yeah.

74
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.010
<v 1>And then I also was surprised,</v>

75
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.600
like I thought you could say here will be our culture and our

76
00:04:30.601 --> 00:04:33.720
values and that it was kind of distinct from who I,

77
00:04:33.721 --> 00:04:37.770
and my co-founder were as people. And it's like, no, that's not how that works.

78
00:04:37.771 --> 00:04:41.310
We just kind of like ooze out our behaviors.

79
00:04:41.311 --> 00:04:43.080
And then the company grows around that.

80
00:04:43.081 --> 00:04:48.000
So you have to do a lot of like introspection and self work to not

81
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.923
end up with it.

82
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.110
<v 0>It's kind of a, it's a, it's a, it's a relationship,</v>

83
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.570
but it's as opposed to a relationship with two people,

84
00:04:54.571 --> 00:04:57.570
it's relationship with many people. Yeah. Yeah.

85
00:04:57.571 --> 00:05:01.740
You communicate so much indirectly by who you are. You have to be. Yes.

86
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.950
You have to live it. Yeah. Uh,

87
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.260
as somebody I think about this a lot,

88
00:05:07.261 --> 00:05:11.280
because generally I'm full of love and all those kinds of things.

89
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.820
But like I also get like really passionate.

90
00:05:14.821 --> 00:05:18.450
And when I see somebody in, in the context of work,

91
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.860
especially when I see somebody who I know can do a much better job

92
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.470
and they don't do a great job,

93
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.390
I can lose my in a way that's like Steve jobs in.

94
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.210
And you have to think about exactly the right way to lose your if you're going

95
00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:37.830
to, or if at all,

96
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.570
you have to really think through that because it sends a big signal. Uh,

97
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.540
you know, sometimes that's okay. Like if you do deliberately,

98
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.110
like if you're going to do it deliberately, if you're going to say like,

99
00:05:49.111 --> 00:05:52.770
I'm going to be the kind of person that allows this and pays the cost of it,

100
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.960
but you can't just think it's not going to have a cost.

101
00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.290
<v 1>Yes. This was like the first thing I worked on with my leadership coach was</v>

102
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.900
to how not to just snap at people when they were being

103
00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:08.360
an idiot. And, um,

104
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.480
first I got really good at apologizing.

105
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.360
That was the first step because it was going to take longer.

106
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.133
<v 2>That's brilliant.</v>

107
00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.840
<v 1>She I've got, I'm actually a lot better at it now.</v>

108
00:06:19.841 --> 00:06:23.740
And it started with things she's like every time you walk through a doorway,

109
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.210
think, you know, calm and take breasts before responding.

110
00:06:28.211 --> 00:06:30.610
And there are all sorts of these little things we did.

111
00:06:30.611 --> 00:06:33.070
And it was mostly just changing the habit.

112
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.810
<v 2>Yeah. Boy, it's a long road.</v>
