1
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.430
<v 0>I, I talk about Epstein a lot. So I'm like, oh, you do? Yeah. Okay. And, and he,</v>

2
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.470
I was gonna say in terms of conspiracy theory, that one changed my outlook.

3
00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:12.190
Cause I was like, I was like, whoa,

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.990
like you have this dude who convinced some of the most successful people

5
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.190
on earth that he was like some money manager and it looks like it was totally

6
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.980
fake. Leon black. I mean, this is one of the richest men on wall street,

7
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.020
$9 billion net worth.

8
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.940
Why has he given him over a hundred million between 2015 and

9
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.420
2019? Yeah. What's going on here, Lex Wexner. Same thing. So yeah,

10
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.780
I wanna hear because you know,

11
00:00:38.781 --> 00:00:42.260
people who met him and the only person I know him met him was Eric Weinstein.

12
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.130
I've I've heard his right. Oh.

13
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.010
<v 1>Boy. So I listen, I'm still Lynn and Eric is fascinating. And like,</v>

14
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.010
Eric is full on saying that.

15
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.930
<v 0>Uh, right. He was a Mustad or.</v>

16
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.730
<v 1>Whatever. Yeah. There's a fun for something, uh, something much, much,</v>

17
00:00:56.731 --> 00:01:01.690
much bigger. Um, and there's, uh, whatever his name, Robert Maxwell, all the,

18
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:02.783
all those stories

19
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.480
you could dig deeper and deeper that Jeffrey's just like the tip of the iceberg.

20
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.560
I just think he's an exceptionally charismatic, listen,

21
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.400
this isn't speaking from confidence or like deep understanding of the situation.

22
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.040
But from my speaking with people, he just seems like,

23
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.360
at least from the side of his in

24
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.670
and interaction with researchers,

25
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.310
he just seems like somebody that was exceptionally charismatic, uh,

26
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.190
and actually took interest.

27
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.710
He was unable to speak about interesting scientific things,

28
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.230
but he took interest in them. Hmm.

29
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.380
So he knew how to stroke the egos of a lot of powerful people, like, well,

30
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.140
like in, in different kinds of ways, I suppose I don't know about this,

31
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.660
cuz I don't have like if a really, okay, this is, this is weird to say,

32
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.620
but I have an ability. Okay.

33
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.500
I think women are beautiful. I like women. But like if, if a,

34
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.290
like a supermodel came to me or something like,

35
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.530
like I'm able to reason, it seems like some people yes.

36
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.370
Are not able to think clearly when there's like an attractive woman in the room.

37
00:02:16.371 --> 00:02:20.690
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and I think that was one of the tools he used to manipulate

38
00:02:20.691 --> 00:02:24.730
people. Interesting. I don't know. Listen, it's like the pedophile thing. Right.

39
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.880
I, I don't know how people are complete sex addicts, but like, it seems like,

40
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.120
like looking out into the world, like there's a,

41
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.280
like the me too movement have revealed that there's a lot of like weird. Yeah.

42
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.640
Like, uh, creepy people out there. I don't know.

43
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.320
But I think it was just one of the many tools that he used, uh, to,

44
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.790
uh, convince people and manipulate people, but not in some like, um,

45
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.550
evil way, but more,

46
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.350
just really good at the art of conversation. Yeah.

47
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.280
And just winning people over on the side.

48
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.160
And then by building through that process,

49
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.400
building a network of other really powerful people and not explicitly,

50
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.160
but implicitly having done shady with powerful people.

51
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.473
Yeah.

52
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.550
Like building up a kind of implied power

53
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.510
of like, like we did some shady together.

54
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.270
So we're not like you're gonna help me out on this extra thing I need to do now.

55
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.870
And that builds and builds and builds to where you're able to actually control,

56
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.140
like have quite a lot of power without explain having like a strategy meeting.

57
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.780
And I think a single person, or yeah,

58
00:03:45.781 --> 00:03:49.180
I think a single person can do that or can start that ball rolling.

59
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.780
And over time it becomes a group thing. Like, I don't know if, uh,

60
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.420
Julia Maxwell was involved or others and yeah, over time it becomes, oh,

61
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.330
was like a really powerful organization that wasn't,

62
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.650
that's not a front for something much deeper and bigger,

63
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.330
but it's almost like maybe it's cause I love cellular a toter man.

64
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.410
&lt;laugh&gt; a system that starts out as a simple thing with simple rules can create

65
00:04:15.411 --> 00:04:18.690
incredible complexity. Yes. And so I just think that, uh,

66
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.760
we're now in retrospect it looks like an incredibly complex system that's

67
00:04:23.761 --> 00:04:26.800
operating in, but like that's just because it's, you know,

68
00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:29.280
there could be a lot of other Jeffrey Epsteins in,

69
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.720
in my perspective that the simple thing just, uh,

70
00:04:32.721 --> 00:04:35.520
was successful early on and builds and builds and builds and builds.

71
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.400
And then there's, uh,

72
00:04:37.401 --> 00:04:42.390
creepy that like a lot of aspects of the system helped it get bigger and bigger

73
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.750
and more powerful and so on. So the final result is, I mean,

74
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.990
listen, I, I have a pretty optimistic, I have a,

75
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.710
I tend to see the good in people.

76
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.510
And so it's been heartbreaking to me in general, just to see, you know, people,

77
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.100
I look up to not have level of integrity. I thought they would,

78
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.780
or like the strength of character. Mm-hmm,

79
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:06.693
&lt;affirmative&gt; all those kinds of things.

80
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.260
And it seems like you should be able to,

81
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.300
to see the that is Jeffrey Epstein. Like when you meet him. Right. Uh,

82
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.260
we're not talking about like Eric Weinstein,

83
00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:19.700
like one or two or three or five interactions,

84
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.570
but like there's people that had like, like years of relationship with him.

85
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.410
Yeah. And I don't know. I, I'm not sure.

86
00:05:27.411 --> 00:05:29.690
Even after he was convicted after he was convicted,

87
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.930
that's that always gets yeah. There's there's stories. I mean,

88
00:05:32.931 --> 00:05:37.330
I don't need to sort of, uh, I honestly believe,

89
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.050
okay. Here's the open question I have.

90
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.050
I don't know how many creepy sexual people that are out there. Like,

91
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.530
I don't know if there's like,

92
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.530
like the people I know the faculty and so on.

93
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.680
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I don't know if they have like a kink that I'm just not

94
00:05:57.681 --> 00:06:01.520
aware of. That was being leveraged. Because to me,

95
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.600
it seems like if, if, if people aren't,

96
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.240
if not everybody's the &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt; then it's just the art of

97
00:06:09.241 --> 00:06:13.800
conversation that is just like the art of just like manipulating people by

98
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.710
making them feel good about like the and stuff they're doing. Listen, man,

99
00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:19.710
academics are people talk about money.

100
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.110
I don't think academics care about money as much as people think,

101
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.950
what they care about is like somebody, they, they, they want to be,

102
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.900
uh,

103
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.110
it's the same thing that Instagram models posting their butt pictures is they

104
00:06:33.111 --> 00:06:35.990
want to be loved. They want attention. My parents are.

105
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.823
<v 0>Professors. Yeah.</v>

106
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.780
<v 1>They, they, and Jeff Epstein, like the money is another way to show attention.</v>

107
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.260
Right. It's a proxy, it's it mind work matters. And, and, and he,

108
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.260
for some of he did that for some of the weirdest,

109
00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:56.220
most brilliant people. I don't wanna sort of drop names,

110
00:06:56.221 --> 00:06:57.260
but everybody knows them.

111
00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.890
&lt;affirmative&gt; it's like people that are the most interesting academics is the

112
00:07:01.891 --> 00:07:02.970
one he cared about. Yeah.

113
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.770
Like people are thinking about the most difficult questions of,

114
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.490
in all of science and all of engineering. So those people are,

115
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.530
were kind of outcasts in academia a little bit because they're doing the weird.

116
00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:18.360
They were the weirdos &lt;laugh&gt; and he cared about the weirdos and he gave the

117
00:07:18.361 --> 00:07:21.800
money. And that, uh, you know, I that's,

118
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.160
I don't know if there's something more nefarious than that. Uh, I, I hope not,

119
00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.640
but maybe I'm surprised. And in fact, half the population of the world is the.

120
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.920
<v 0>Pedophiles. No, I, I think it's what you were talking about,</v>

121
00:07:32.921 --> 00:07:35.200
which is that it's the,

122
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.480
it's the implication after the initial. Right.

123
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:40.390
You do some shady things together,

124
00:07:40.391 --> 00:07:43.510
or you do something that you want out of the public eye and you're a public

125
00:07:43.511 --> 00:07:47.150
person. And look, we probably even experienced this to a limited extent. Right.

126
00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:49.590
You're like, ah, you know, like I don't want to, I don't know.

127
00:07:49.591 --> 00:07:52.630
I almost lost my temper, you know, one time, whenever a car hit me and I'm like,

128
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.710
I can't freak out in public anymore. Like that, you know?

129
00:07:54.711 --> 00:07:56.830
Like what if somebody takes a photo or something? Yeah.

130
00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.660
And so I think that there's an extent of that times a billion,

131
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.380
literally when you have a billion dollars or more,

132
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.340
and you take that all together and you stack it up on itself.

133
00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.220
I saw a story about like bill Clinton,

134
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:13.260
like bill Clinton was with Epstein or with Maxwell in a private

135
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.900
air terminal or something. And she had one of their like sex, you know,

136
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.010
one of those girls who was underage had her dressed up in a literal,

137
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:25.570
like pilot uniform. And she was underage in order to, you know,

138
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:30.210
and she was dis being disguised for being older. And she was a misuse.

139
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.650
Right. Because that was one of the, uh, guises,

140
00:08:32.651 --> 00:08:35.850
which they got in order to sexually traffic, these women. And she was like,

141
00:08:35.851 --> 00:08:37.650
bill was like complaining about his neck and she's like,

142
00:08:37.651 --> 00:08:39.250
give bill Clinton a massage. Right.

143
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:43.200
So now there's of an underage girl giving a massage to the former president of

144
00:08:43.201 --> 00:08:47.840
the United States. I don't think he knew. Right. But like that looks bad.

145
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.720
And so I thi this is kind of what we're getting at,

146
00:08:50.721 --> 00:08:55.000
which is that you're setting it all up and creating those preconditions or like

147
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.880
prince Andrew, do I think prince Andrew knew that Virginia gore was underage.

148
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.040
I don't know. Probably knew she was pretty young, which I think is, you know,

149
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.400
ski enough where you're a prince, you probably know better. Yeah.

150
00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.520
But I don't think he knew she was underage or maybe he did. And if he did,

151
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.990
then he is even more of a piece of than I thought. But when we,

152
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.550
when we look at these things, the,

153
00:09:17.551 --> 00:09:20.030
the stuff I'm more interested in is like what you were talking about.

154
00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:24.270
I'm like bill gates, how do you get the richest man of the world in your house?

155
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.270
Yeah. Like under what gates is like,

156
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:29.150
he was talking about financing and all this I'm like,

157
00:09:29.151 --> 00:09:31.590
you don't have access to money or bankers.

158
00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.110
Like you're the richest man in the world.

159
00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:39.060
Like you can Goldman Sachs anytime you want on a hotline. Like, why do you need,

160
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.120
that's where,

161
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.060
that's where I start again to get more conspiratorial because I'm like,

162
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.580
bill dude, you can, you have the gold credit, right?

163
00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:51.220
Like you don't need Epstein to create some complicated financing structure or

164
00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:56.330
Leon black. Like what is two thousand fifteen thousand nine? I mean,

165
00:09:56.331 --> 00:09:58.010
this is very recent stuff. Or,

166
00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:01.290
and this is the part that really got me is I read the department of,

167
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.890
I think it's called the department of financial service report around dosha bank

168
00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:09.770
with Epstein. They knew he was a criminal. They solicited his business.

169
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:14.490
Explicitly knew that his business meant access to other high net worth

170
00:10:14.491 --> 00:10:15.324
individuals,

171
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:21.040
consistently dolled money out from his account for hush payments to women in

172
00:10:21.041 --> 00:10:24.960
Europe and prostitution rings. They knew all of this within the bank.

173
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.920
It was elevated multiple times. Here's the other one,

174
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.160
one of Epstein's associates was like, Hey,

175
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:33.200
how much money can we take out before we hit the, you know,

176
00:10:33.201 --> 00:10:35.920
automatic sensor before you have to tell the IRS.

177
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.270
And that question by,

178
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:43.230
by their own standards is supposed to result in a notification to the feds and

179
00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:44.090
they never did it.

180
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:48.590
And he was withdrawing like 2 million of cash in five years for tips. Yeah.

181
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:52.790
To I'm like, okay, I'm like, something's going on here? Yeah. Like you.

182
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:53.231
<v 1>See what I'm saying?</v>

183
00:10:53.231 --> 00:10:57.780
There's a lot of signs that make you think that there's a bigger thing at play

184
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.940
than just the man that there's some,

185
00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.940
it does look like a larger organization is using this front.

186
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:09.060
<v 0>Right. It's PO again, I don't know. I, I truly don't know.</v>

187
00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.820
And I'm not willing to use the certainty,

188
00:11:10.821 --> 00:11:13.900
which I think a lot of people online are to say like it wants 100%.

189
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:14.900
The certain is always.

190
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.060
<v 1>The problem, because that,</v>

191
00:11:16.061 --> 00:11:20.930
that's probably why I hesitate to touch conspiracy theories is cuz I'm

192
00:11:20.931 --> 00:11:24.010
allergic to certainty in all forms, in politics,

193
00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:27.930
any kind of discourse and people are so sure in,

194
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:30.890
in both directions actually it's, it's kind of hilarious. Uh,

195
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:35.490
either they're sure that the conspiracy theory, uh, particular,

196
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:39.280
whatever the conspiracy theories is false. Like almost dismiss it. Like,

197
00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.280
uh, like they don't even wanna talk about it's like the people,

198
00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:47.840
like the way they dismiss that the earth is flat. Yes. Most scientists are like,

199
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:52.000
they don't even want to like hear what the,

200
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:53.600
what the flat earthers are saying.

201
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.560
&lt;laugh&gt; they don't have a like zero patience for it, which is like,

202
00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:00.800
maybe in that case yeah. Is deserved.

203
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.480
But everything else you really like have empathy,

204
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:09.760
like consider the, you have like, this is weird to say,

205
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:14.710
but I feel like you have to &lt;affirmative&gt; consider that the earth might

206
00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:19.350
be flat for like one minute. Like you have to be empathetic.

207
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:20.830
You have to be open minded.
