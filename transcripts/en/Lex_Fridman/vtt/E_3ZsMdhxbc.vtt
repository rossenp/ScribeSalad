00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.980
<v 0>There is something that she's comped on,</v>

2
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:09.900
which is she's suffered or went through depression after winning

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.980
her second Olympic gold. Why do you think this happens?

4
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.660
You often hear stories of great champions becoming depressed after

5
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.513
the Olympics.

6
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.610
<v 1>There's a lack of purpose afterwards, right?</v>

7
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:27.450
Because you you've done in life. What you set out to do,

8
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.170
you've had a goal every day, you woke up, you knew what your purpose was.

9
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.810
You knew what your, you knew what your day looked like.

10
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.650
<v 2>You knew why you were doing that.</v>

11
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.130
And all of a sudden you won and you got all the fame and you're all happy and

12
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.630
it, but then you wake up and you go now what?

13
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.430
I don't have a next. And, and also because there was nothing for her,

14
00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:56.190
there was no, there was no path set out for Kayla that said, okay,

15
00:00:56.191 --> 00:00:58.110
we're gonna, you know, you're gonna become an ambassador,

16
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.470
a global ambassador of judo. You know, the I JF is gonna help pay a salary. The,

17
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.220
the USA judo is gonna to give you a salary. Here's what we,

18
00:01:06.221 --> 00:01:07.500
we want you to go teach children.

19
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.980
<v 1>We want you to go be an ambassador for woman. We're gonna fly you around. And,</v>

20
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.140
and you know, whatever it is, we didn't give you a job.

21
00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:16.740
And here's what you're gonna do. You know, if you'd like to take it,

22
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.100
there was nothing for her.

23
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.260
Like I remember doing the interview at the Olympics with her and they said,

24
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.100
are you gonna compete in the next Olympics? And I said, no, what,

25
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.490
why she already two time gold medalist? What,

26
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.890
what does three time gold medalist do for her? Nothing. Right?

27
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.970
Doesn't motivate her to do it again. They said, are you doing MMA? I said, no.

28
00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:38.650
Why would she do MMA? That's ridiculous. Like, she doesn't need MMA.

29
00:01:38.651 --> 00:01:43.010
She should be able to make a living off of what she's accomplished in this sport

30
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.480
for the rest of her life. Yes, but happens is,

31
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.680
and what most people don't understand is once you say I'm retired,

32
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.880
I'm no longer competing in the, in the sport of judo.

33
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.000
You don't get a salary from USA judo anymore, which she was getting.

34
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.080
I think she got like $72,000 a year from, from USA. Judo. At the time,

35
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.710
you don't get a stipend from the Olympic committee anymore. Goes away.

36
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.413
Your sponsor,

37
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.950
like the New York athletic club was a great sponsor for her for all those years.

38
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.610
In fact,

39
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.630
she could have never been the athlete she became without the support of the NYC.

40
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.270
Cuz I talked to them when she was 15. I said, Hey,

41
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.430
I got a girl that's really good someday. Like if you invest in her,

42
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.740
I promise you she'll pay back for you. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. And they,

43
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.620
and I remember the day she won the Olympic goal, they called the guy up. I said,

44
00:02:32.621 --> 00:02:35.940
Hey, I told you, she mean so, but you know,

45
00:02:35.941 --> 00:02:39.220
they can no longer give you stipends because you're not competing and

46
00:02:39.221 --> 00:02:42.540
representing them anymore. So that goes away. Um,

47
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.580
all of your sponsorships and all of your money that you would make from your TV,

48
00:02:46.581 --> 00:02:50.130
commercial or whatever, that didn't happen for her after the Olympics,

49
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.050
cuz Judah's a obscure sport. Right?

50
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.730
So she didn't have any opportunities for that. At the end of the day,

51
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.690
she has no, no revenue coming in. How do you live?

52
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.440
You get a bonus of 25 grand from the Olympic committee or whatever for,

53
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.800
for winning a gold. But aside from that, you're not gonna live on that money.

54
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.840
So no purpose, no goal. Right? What am I gonna wake up and do tomorrow?

55
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.320
I don't know. So she has no direction. And at the same,

56
00:03:13.321 --> 00:03:16.640
then at the same time she has no money coming in. So everything shuts off.

57
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.830
So now it's like way do you turn, what do you do? You know? And,

58
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.510
and that leads to being depressed because yeah,

59
00:03:24.511 --> 00:03:28.070
even though I've accomplished all this stuff, I'm kind of lost in life.

60
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.470
Like what's next for me?

61
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.430
<v 0>And I guess, did you just have to ride that out?</v>

62
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.150
Because when you're a great human being, a great champion,

63
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.020
life has a way of &lt;affirmative&gt; helping you find a way, right? I mean,

64
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.540
she she's in mixed martial arts now, but she has a lot of stuff going on.

65
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.380
<v 1>Right? Well, her kids, she, she, she adopted her, her sister's kids.</v>

66
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.100
So she's their legal guardian now. So that is her purpose, right? Raising,

67
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.900
raising these kids and making them part of her family. And um,

68
00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.460
she's fortunate enough that she,

69
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.770
she has enough money that she can do that and she can give them a good life.
