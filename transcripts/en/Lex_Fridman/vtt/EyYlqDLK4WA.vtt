00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.190
<v 0>Yeah. I, I definitely just like with fasting,</v>

2
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.430
have the philosophical benefit of running long and running slow.

3
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.070
I enjoy cuz it,

4
00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:14.550
it kind of clears the mind and allows you to think actually listen to brown

5
00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:15.430
noise. As I run,

6
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.910
it really helps remove myself from the world and just like zoom in a particular

7
00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:24.660
thoughts. What are brown noise? It's it's like white noise, but deeper.

8
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.420
So like the white noise is like, and then brown noise is more like,

9
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.740
like ocean. That sounds great. I.

10
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:34.650
<v 1>I might try that.</v>

11
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.020
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. It's uh,</v>

12
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.460
it's mostly thing probably I'm I'm not sure there could be science to this.

13
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.860
I need to look this up. I've been meaning to, but I've when I started,

14
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.810
uh, this is maybe like five years ago.

15
00:00:46.811 --> 00:00:49.690
I started listening brow noise when I work. And uh,

16
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.330
the first time I listened to it,

17
00:00:51.331 --> 00:00:56.010
something happened to my mind where it just went like zoomed in

18
00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.370
to like in a way that it felt like really weird, like how,

19
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.920
how precisely it was able to sort of remove the distractions of the world

20
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.280
and really help my mind, obviously like the mind is trying to focus.

21
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.560
And then it just enabled that process of trying to focus on a particular

22
00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:19.160
problem. I don't know if this is generalizable to others,

23
00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:21.880
people should definitely try to feel listening to this. Um,

24
00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:25.070
maybe it's just my own mind, but it's funny me. Like

25
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.830
it made me brown noise made me realize that there's probably hacks out there

26
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.670
that work for me, that I should be constantly looking for. It's almost like, um,

27
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.310
an encouraging and motivating of event that

28
00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:44.510
maybe there's other stuff out there. Maybe there's other brown noise,

29
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.620
like thing out there that truly like almost immediately make me feel better.

30
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.700
I don't know if it's generalizable to others,

31
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.420
but it does seem that it's the case.

32
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.220
That there's probably for many others, things like that,

33
00:01:57.221 --> 00:01:58.260
that could be discovered.

34
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.620
And so it's always disappointing when I find things in life that

35
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.090
I wish I would found earlier. Like I got LASIK eye surgery, uh,

36
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.610
a few years ago and the first thought I had,

37
00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:16.210
like the next day when I woke up is like, why didn't I do this way earlier?

38
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.770
There's all this stuff, uh, of, of that nature that, um,

39
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.570
that yet to be discovered. So pace to explore.

40
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.440
<v 1>Yeah, though, you have a different mind. You have quite a beautiful mind.</v>

41
00:02:27.441 --> 00:02:31.480
So I suspect brown noise helps you focus and cuz you're probably all over the

42
00:02:31.481 --> 00:02:32.800
place if you don't control.

43
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.360
<v 0>It. Yeah, exactly. I mean something about it. It's a programmer thing.</v>

44
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.920
I don't the a programming is a really difficult, um,

45
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.600
mental journey. Cause you have to keep a lot of things in mind. You have to. Uh,

46
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.030
so you're constantly designing things.

47
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.550
Then you have to be extremely precise by making those things concrete in code.

48
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.870
You also have to look stuff up on the internet

49
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.320
to sort of feed like information and looking up stuff on the internet.

50
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.320
Internet is full of like distracting things.

51
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.200
So you have to be really focused in the way you look stuff up and pulling that

52
00:03:09.201 --> 00:03:13.240
information in. So it requires a certain discipline and a certain focus that,

53
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.360
uh, I've been very much exploring how to do like I do it really well in the

54
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.390
coffee's involved, all those kinds of things you're trying to optimize, uh,

55
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.390
keeping very positive, inspired, no social media,

56
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.910
all those kinds of things and trying to optimize for.

57
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.430
And everybody has their own kind of little journey that they try to understand.

58
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.350
You get this from like writers. When you read about the habits of writers,

59
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.340
like the habits they do in the morning, they usually write like 2, 3,

60
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.340
4 hours a day and that's it.

61
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.740
It's like they optimize that ritual and then there's always hunter Thompson.

62
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.940
So &lt;laugh&gt; uh,

63
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.580
sometimes it pays off to be wild.
