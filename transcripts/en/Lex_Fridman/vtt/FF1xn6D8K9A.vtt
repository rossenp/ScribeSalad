00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.890
<v 0>So, did you prepare for Jake cardio wise? Yeah, I worked hard.</v>

2
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.130
Yeah, I did. But it was, I, I told you I started training for my, I mean,

3
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.530
once, once I had my hip surgery, they said, uh, you know,

4
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:19.050
for the first six weeks you can't even walk. Yeah. I,

5
00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:22.970
and it was hard for me to listen to him. Cause by week four and a half five, I,

6
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.000
I was feeling pretty good. I wanna get my crutches, but I'm like, you know what,

7
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:28.600
this is for the rest of my life. And if you get the,

8
00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:31.480
so if you get the real hip replacement, there's no wrestling.

9
00:00:31.481 --> 00:00:33.960
There's no nothing. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; right. So that's the next step, so,

10
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.680
okay. I'm gonna take this serious. So I do my crutches for the six weeks,

11
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.880
the next six weeks. It's still like really low weight bearing can't yeah.

12
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.870
Do anything, you know, so then I get done with the three months,

13
00:00:44.871 --> 00:00:48.470
which is like January and I'm like, okay, I should start working out.

14
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.710
So I start riding a bike a little bit and then, okay, I'm now I'm fat. I'm fat.

15
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.430
I'm gonna get in better shape. Cause I haven't able do anything.

16
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.670
So I'm actually start working out and uh, and then that happened, right?

17
00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:59.471
So I'm like, okay,

18
00:00:59.471 --> 00:01:03.150
well now I got three months and it gives me a good reason to get back in shape.

19
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.260
And um, you know, I, I knew I wasn't gonna do be a full-time boxer.

20
00:01:08.261 --> 00:01:11.980
So it's like, okay, how do I put a box in camp together? So I found, you know,

21
00:01:11.981 --> 00:01:13.780
I had, I had my old teammate, Mike Rhode,

22
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.300
he came up and kind of lived with me ish kind of thing for three months.

23
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.780
Uh, I found a couple, this guy canine out of Michigan, he came over three weeks.

24
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.730
He was great. I went to Freddy RO for a week. So I kind of like, you know,

25
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.890
tried to get me good as ideas as I could. And my thought was like, okay,

26
00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:36.090
well if this dude sucks, I can just be tough and you know, block a, you punches,

27
00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:38.330
get him tired and then beat him up. If he's good.

28
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.970
That's probably not much of my do about in the next three months cuz I'm I'm I

29
00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:43.290
was never good at boxing in the first place.

30
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.880
All of my stand up in mixed martial arts was predicated on how do I get through

31
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.720
the two or three punches that are gonna come at me in the time I need to get

32
00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:52.440
ahold of them. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know, it's only,

33
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.840
you only have to make two or three of them miss and then boom,

34
00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:57.000
you're on top of 'em, at least for me. Um,

35
00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.880
that was all my striking was predicated on it. Wasn't about, Hey,

36
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.960
I'm gonna do damage on the feet in order to make something else happen.

37
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.830
It was like, how do I clear this barrier get ahold of, of you? And if you, I,

38
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.030
I actually did the math one time. I think I gotta take down.

39
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.590
If you include the knockout round against miles vial,

40
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.030
I gotta take down every round except two. So it was like,

41
00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:20.030
it was like 53 outta 55 rounds in MMA. I gotta take down. Wow. Somewhere,

42
00:02:20.031 --> 00:02:20.630
somewhere in there.
