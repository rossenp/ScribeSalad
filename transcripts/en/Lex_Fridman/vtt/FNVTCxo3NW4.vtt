00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.590
<v 0>See, the problem is like with all this, the living by principles,</v>

2
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.180
living in principle life,

3
00:00:08.181 --> 00:00:12.500
focusing on relationships and kind of thinking of this life as this perfect

4
00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:16.970
thing, kind of forgets the notion that none of it, you know,

5
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.760
makes any sense, right? Like the,

6
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.700
like it kind of implies that this is like a video game and you want

7
00:00:25.701 --> 00:00:30.680
to get a high score as opposed to none of this even makes sense.

8
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.060
<v 2>Like, why would he like what that, like,</v>

9
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.720
like what does it even mean to die is going to be over?

10
00:00:38.721 --> 00:00:43.550
It's like everything I do, all of these productivity hacks, all this life,

11
00:00:43.551 --> 00:00:44.271
all these efforts,

12
00:00:44.271 --> 00:00:46.940
all this creative efforts kind of assume it's going to go on forever.

13
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.170
There's a kind of a sense of immortality and I don't even know how to

14
00:00:51.171 --> 00:00:53.780
intellectually makes sense that it ends. Uh, of course,

15
00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:57.740
got to ask you in that context, what do you think is the meaning of it all,

16
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.490
especially for computer scientists. I mean, there's gotta be some mathematical.

17
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.620
<v 1>Yeah. 27 or what's the Douglas Adams. Yeah,</v>

18
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.960
42. Okay. 27 is a better number. I should read more Spotify, um, a.

19
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.760
<v 0>Year onto something with a 27.</v>

20
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.510
<v 1>I don't wanna give away too much, but just trust me 27 divisible.</v>

21
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.920
<v 0>Yeah. Um.</v>

22
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.650
<v 1>So I mean, I don't know, obviously, right. I mean I'm hoping would, yeah, I,</v>

23
00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:25.700
I don't know, but,

24
00:01:25.701 --> 00:01:28.730
but going back to what you were saying about the sort of the existentialist or

25
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.810
sort of the more nihilist style approach, the one thing that,

26
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.260
that there is, are intimations, right? So there's these

27
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.570
intimations to human halves of somehow this feels right, and this feels wrong.

28
00:01:41.571 --> 00:01:45.770
This feels good. This feels like I'm doing, I mean, aligned with something,

29
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.740
you know, when I'm acting with courage to save whatever, right. It's not,

30
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.470
these intimations are grounding against arbitrary ness.

31
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.640
Like one of the ideas I'm really interested in is that, uh,

32
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.000
when you look at religion, right? So I'm, I'm, I'm,

33
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:02.300
I'm interested in world religions for, for my, my grandfather was a, uh,

34
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.520
like a theologian that studied and wrote all these books.

35
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.810
And I'm very interested in this type of stuff. And there's this great book.

36
00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:12.620
That's, it's, it's not, um, specific to a particular religion,

37
00:02:12.621 --> 00:02:15.320
but as Karen Armstrong wrote this great book called the case for God,

38
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.671
she's very interesting.

39
00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:19.520
She was a Catholic nun who sort of left that religion and is,

40
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.700
but one of the smartest thinkers, uh,

41
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.340
in terms of like accessible theological thinking,

42
00:02:25.341 --> 00:02:29.030
that's not tied to any particular religion, her whole argument,

43
00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:31.370
is that the way to understand religion? You, you, first of all,

44
00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:33.530
you have to go way back pre enlightenment, where all this was formed.

45
00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:37.010
We got messed up thinking about religion. Post-enlightenment right. And, and,

46
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.150
um, these were operating systems for making sense of intimations.

47
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.040
The one thing we had are these different inflammations of this field,

48
00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:48.830
like awe and mystical experience.

49
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.430
And this feels some there's something you feel when you act in a certain way and

50
00:02:52.431 --> 00:02:53.540
don't act in this other way.

51
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.100
And it was like the scientists who were trying to study and understand the model

52
00:02:58.101 --> 00:03:00.430
of the atom by just looking at experiments,

53
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.040
trying to understand what's going on, like the,

54
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.400
the great religions of the world.

55
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.820
We're basically figuring out how do we make sense of these informations and live

56
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:09.700
in alignment with them and build a life of meaning around that?

57
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.250
What were the tools they were using? They were using ritual.

58
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:14.350
They were using belief. They were using action,

59
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.010
but all of it was like an O S it was like a,

60
00:03:17.011 --> 00:03:19.480
a liturgical model of the atom that did that.

61
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.170
<v 0>That's hard coded in. So it did, uh, through the evolutionary process.</v>

62
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.310
<v 1>But I mean, they wouldn't have called it that back then, or, yeah. I mean,</v>

63
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:30.370
whether they'd said they didn't have that, it was pre enlightenment.

64
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.870
And if they just say this is here and the directive is to try to live in

65
00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:36.130
alignment with that. Well.

66
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.760
<v 0>Then I want to ask who wrote the original code? Yeah.</v>

67
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.300
<v 1>So question. Yeah. So,</v>

68
00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:43.450
so Armstrong lays out this good argument and where it gets really interesting is

69
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.800
that, that she emphasizes that all of this was considered an ethical, right?

70
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.510
So the, the whole notion,

71
00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:51.580
and this is like rich and Jewish tradition in particular,

72
00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:54.400
and also in Islamic tradition, we can't comprehend it,

73
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.530
understand what's going on here. Right?

74
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.800
And so the best we can do to approximate understanding and live in alignment as

75
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:04.630
we like act as if this is true, do these rituals have these actions or whatever.

76
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.190
Post-enlightenment a lot of that got, once we learned about enlightenment,

77
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.690
we grew these suspicions around religions that are very much of the modern era,

78
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.510
right? So like the, the Karen Armstrong lake, uh,

79
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.180
Sam Harris's critique of religion makes no sense, right?

80
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:20.860
Th th the critiques based on, well,

81
00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:23.560
this is you're making the assent to propositions that you think are true for

82
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:25.180
what you do not have evidence that they are true. So like,

83
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:28.510
that's an enlightenment thing, right? This is not the context. And this is not,

84
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.680
the religion is the Rutherford model of the atom. Like, it's not actually,

85
00:04:32.681 --> 00:04:34.930
maybe what is underneath happening,

86
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.720
but this model explains while your chemical equations work.

87
00:04:37.721 --> 00:04:40.390
And so this is like the way religion was you, you, there's a,

88
00:04:40.391 --> 00:04:42.880
God we'll call it this. This is how it works. We do this ritual.

89
00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:46.300
We act in this way, it aligns with it just like the model the Adam predicted,

90
00:04:46.301 --> 00:04:48.670
Y you know, in a and C L is going to become salt.

91
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.070
This predicts that you're going to feel and live in alignment. Right.

92
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:53.380
It's like this beautiful, sophisticated theory,

93
00:04:53.381 --> 00:04:56.920
which actually matches how a lot of great theologians have, you know,

94
00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.070
thought about it. Um, but then when you come forward in time, yeah.

95
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.580
Maybe it's evolution. I mean, this is like what Peterson hints at, right. Like,

96
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:06.550
he's basically, he's not,

97
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.820
he doesn't like to get super pinned down on this, but, um,

98
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.040
it's kind of seems where he's.

99
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:13.360
<v 0>Like searching for the.</v>

100
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.960
<v 1>Words. He focuses more on like young and other people. But, uh, I mean,</v>

101
00:05:16.961 --> 00:05:19.720
I know he's very union, but, but that same type of analysis,

102
00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:22.150
I think roughly speaking, like Armstrong is sort of a,

103
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.370
it's kind of like a Peter Sonian analysis,

104
00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:29.050
but she's looking more at the deep history of religion than, uh, but yeah,

105
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.910
he throws in an evolutionary.

106
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.180
<v 0>I wonder what it finds.</v>

107
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.680
I wonder what the new home is if religion dissipates and what the new home for

108
00:05:37.681 --> 00:05:42.330
these kinds of natural inclinations are. Uh, yeah. Well,

109
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.373
this technology.

110
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.500
<v 1>And if it's evolution, I mean, this is Francis Collins, his book also,</v>

111
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.270
he's like, well, that's a religious, that could be a very religious notion.

112
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.630
I think this stuff is interesting. I'm not a very religious person, but I'm, uh,

113
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.520
I'm thinking it's not about idea. Maybe, maybe what replaces, honestly,

114
00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:02.210
like maybe what replaces religion is a return to religion,

115
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.040
but in this sort of more sophisticated, I mean, if you went back. Yeah. I mean,

116
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:10.460
it's the issue with like a lot of the, the recent critiques, I think is a,

117
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:14.690
it's a, it's a strawman critique in a complicated way, right?

118
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.290
Because th th the whole way, these, the way this work, I mean, the theologians,

119
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:20.930
if you're reading Paul Tillich, if you're reading Heschel,

120
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:21.950
if you're reading these people, they're,

121
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:24.890
they're thinking very sophisticated about religion in terms of this,

122
00:06:24.891 --> 00:06:27.050
it's an affable, and we're just these things,

123
00:06:27.051 --> 00:06:30.710
and this is a steep connects us to these things in a way that puts life in

124
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:32.720
alignment. We can't really explain what's going on because we're, we,

125
00:06:32.721 --> 00:06:36.620
our brains can't handle it. Right. Um, for the average person, though,

126
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.900
this notion of live as if it's kind of how religions work is Liz live as if this

127
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:45.860
is true, it's like an a N O S for getting in alignment with it, because we,

128
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.770
through cultural evolution, like you behave in this way,

129
00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:53.210
do these original live as if this is true. Um, gives you the,

130
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.830
what the goal you're looking for,

131
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.040
but that's a complicated thing live as if this is true, because if you,

132
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.730
especially, if you're not a theologian to say, uh, yeah,

133
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.650
this is not true in an alignment sense,

134
00:07:03.651 --> 00:07:06.890
but I'm living as if it kind of takes the heat out of it. But of course,

135
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.750
it's what people are doing because, you know,

136
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.470
highly religious people still do bad things where if you really were, you know,

137
00:07:12.471 --> 00:07:14.300
there's absolutely a hell and I'm definitely gonna go to it.

138
00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:16.910
If I do this bad thing, you would never have, you know,

139
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.090
no one would ever murder anyone if they were a evangelical Christian. Right. So,

140
00:07:20.091 --> 00:07:23.350
so it's like what? This is kind of a tangent that I'm, um,

141
00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:24.560
I'm on shaky ground here,

142
00:07:24.561 --> 00:07:27.890
but it's something I've been interested in off and on a lot.

143
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.150
<v 0>Was this fast. I mean, I think we're in some sense searching for, because it is,</v>

144
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.710
it does make for a good operating system.

145
00:07:33.711 --> 00:07:38.600
We're searching for a good live as if X is true and we're searching for a new X.

146
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.310
Yeah. And maybe artificial intelligence will be the very,

147
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.150
the new gods that we're so desperately looking.

148
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:48.920
<v 1>For. Or it'll just spit out 42.</v>

149
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.680
<v 0>I thought it was 27. This is a, as you know, I've been a huge fan.</v>

150
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:59.750
Uh, so are a huge number of people that I've spoken with.

151
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.410
So they telling me, I absolutely have to talk to you. This was a huge honor.

152
00:08:03.411 --> 00:08:06.410
This was really fun. Thanks for wasting all this time with me. Likewise.

153
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.260
<v 1>I'm been a longtime fan. So this was a great lot of fun. Yeah. Thanks man.</v>
