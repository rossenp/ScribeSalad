1
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.750
<v 0>How hard was the decision. And, uh, I mean,</v>

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.150
maybe you can tell me what Instagram looked in the beginning,

3
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.230
but how hard was it to make pictures? The first class citizen,

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.380
that's a revolutionary idea. Like, um,

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.580
at whatever point Instagram became this feed of

6
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.010
photos. That's quite brilliant.

7
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.000
Plus also don't know when this happened,

8
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.220
but it they're all shaped the same.

9
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.930
<v 1>It's like, I have to tell you why that's the interesting part.</v>

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.560
So a couple of things, one is data,

11
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.120
data, like you're right. You can,

12
00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:46.830
over-interpret it like imagine trying to fly a plane by staring

13
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.190
at, I don't know, a single metric, like airspeed,

14
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.290
you don't know if you're going up or down. I mean,

15
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.610
that correlates with up or down,

16
00:00:53.611 --> 00:00:56.760
but you don't actually know will never help you land the plane.

17
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.950
So don't stare at one metric.

18
00:00:58.951 --> 00:01:02.760
Like it turns out you have to synthesize a bunch of metrics to know where to go.

19
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.420
Um, but it doesn't lie. Like if your speed is zero,

20
00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:09.390
unless it's not working right. If it, if it's zero,

21
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.370
you're probably gonna fall out of the sky.

22
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.900
So generally you look around and you have the scan going. Yes.

23
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.910
And you're just asking yourself, is this working or is this not working? Um,

24
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.300
but people have trouble explaining

25
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.120
how they actually feel. So just it's about synthesizing both of them.

26
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:32.790
So then Instagram, right? Uh, uh,

27
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:35.940
we were talking about revolutionary moment where,

28
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:38.850
where the feed became square photos basically.

29
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.340
<v 0>And photos first, and then square-foot.</v>

30
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.980
<v 1>Um, it was clear to me that the biggest, so</v>

31
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.530
I believe the biggest companies are founded when

32
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.320
enormous technical shifts happen.

33
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.490
And the biggest technical shift that happened right before Instagram was founded

34
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.990
was the advent of a phone that didn't suck the iPhone, right?

35
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.400
Like in retrospect, we're like, oh my God, the first iPhone almost had like,

36
00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:11.820
it wasn't that good, but compared to everything else at the time,

37
00:02:11.821 --> 00:02:16.350
it was amazing. And by the way, the first, uh,

38
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.280
phone that had an incredible camera that could,

39
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.770
that could like do as well as the point. And shoot,

40
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:25.980
you might carry around was the iPhone four.

41
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.580
And that was right when Instagram launched and we looked around and we said,

42
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.670
what will change? Because everyone has a camera in their pocket.

43
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.280
And it was so clear to me that the world of social networks

44
00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:43.260
before it was based in the desktop and sitting there and having a link

45
00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:46.800
you could share. Right. And that wasn't going to be the case.

46
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.340
So the question is, what would you share if you were out and about in the world,

47
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.050
if not only did you have a camera that fit in your pocket, but by the way,

48
00:02:55.051 --> 00:02:59.220
that camera had a network attached to it that allowed you to share instantly

49
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.740
that seemed revolutionary. And a bunch of people saw it at the same time.

50
00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:06.340
It wasn't just Instagram. There were a bunch of competitors. Um,

51
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.330
the thing we did, I think was not only while we focused on two things,

52
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:13.030
so we wrote down those things, we circled photos and we said,

53
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:17.080
I think we should invest in this. But then we said, what sucks about photos?

54
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.100
One, they look like crap, right? They just,

55
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.480
at least back then now my phone takes pretty great photos, right?

56
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.130
Um, back then there were blurry, not so great compressed, right?

57
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.310
To, uh, it was really slow, like really slow to upload a photo.

58
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.420
And I'll tell a fun story about that and explain to you why they're all the same

59
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.140
size and square as well. Um, and three,

60
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.010
and if you wanted to share a photo on different networks,

61
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.090
you had to go to each of the individual apps and select all of them and upload

62
00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:55.600
individually. And so we were like, all right, those are the pain points.

63
00:03:55.601 --> 00:04:00.190
We're going to focus on that. So one, instead of because they weren't beautiful.

64
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.400
Um, we were like, why don't we lean into the fact that they're not beautiful?

65
00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:05.200
And I remember studying in Florence,

66
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.020
my photography teacher gave me this whole gate camera,

67
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:09.940
and I'm not sure everyone knows what a whole gay camera is,

68
00:04:09.941 --> 00:04:12.010
but they're these old school, plastic cameras.

69
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.620
I think they're produced in China at the time. And there,

70
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:18.820
I want to say the original ones,

71
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.040
like from the seventies or the eighties or something,

72
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.900
they're supposed to be like $3 cameras for the,

73
00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:27.490
every person they took nice medium format films,

74
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.680
large, large, uh, negatives, but they kind of blurred the, uh,

75
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.260
of the light and they kind of like light leaked into the side.

76
00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:38.830
And there was this whole resurgence where people looked at that and said,

77
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.140
oh my God, this is a style. Right.

78
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.350
And I remember using that in Florence and just saying, well,

79
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.770
why don't we just like lean into the fact that these photo sock and make them

80
00:04:47.771 --> 00:04:50.800
suck more, but in an artistic way.

81
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.080
And it turns out that had product market fit.

82
00:04:53.081 --> 00:04:56.950
People really liked that they were willing to share their not so great photos if

83
00:04:56.951 --> 00:05:01.840
they looked not so great on purpose. Okay. The second part.

84
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.950
<v 0>The, where the filters come into picture.</v>

85
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.900
So computational modification of photos to make them look extra crappy,

86
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.123
where it becomes art.

87
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.820
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, add light leaks,</v>

88
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.450
add like an overlay filter and make them more contrast to you than they should

89
00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:22.860
be. The first filter we ever produced was called X pro two.

90
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.420
And I designed it while I was in this small little bed and breakfast room and

91
00:05:27.421 --> 00:05:31.830
todo Santos, Mexico was trying to take a break from the, the bourbon days.

92
00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:35.580
And I remember saying to my co-founder, I just needed like a week to reset.

93
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.920
And that was on that trip, worked on the first filter because I said, you know,

94
00:05:40.921 --> 00:05:41.940
I think I can do this.

95
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.250
And I literally iterated one by one over the RGB values in

96
00:05:47.251 --> 00:05:51.810
the array. That was the photo. And just slightly shifted. Basically,

97
00:05:51.811 --> 00:05:56.700
there was a function of our function of G function of B that just shifted them

98
00:05:56.701 --> 00:05:59.330
slightly. It wasn't rocket science. Um,

99
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.930
and it turns out that actually made your photo look pretty cool.

100
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.390
It just mapped from one color space to another color space. And it was simple,

101
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.720
but it was really slow. I mean, if you applied a filter,

102
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.460
I think it used to take two or three seconds to render only eventually what I

103
00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:20.270
figured out, how to do it on the GPU. And I'm not even sure it was GPU,

104
00:06:20.271 --> 00:06:22.880
but was using open GL. But anyway, um,

105
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.030
I would eventually figure that out and then it would be instant,

106
00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:30.200
but it used to be really slow by the way, anyone who's watching or listening.

107
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.550
It's amazing what you can get away with in a startup,

108
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.080
as long as the product outcome is right for the user.

109
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.110
Like you can be slow, you can be terrible. You can be,

110
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.480
as long as you have product market fit, people will put up with a lot.

111
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.590
And then the question is just about compressing, uh,

112
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.320
making it more performance over time so that they get that product market fit

113
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.213
instantly.

114
00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.020
<v 0>So fascinating because there's some things where that those three seconds would</v>

115
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.280
make or break the app. But some things you're saying not,

116
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.480
it's hard to know when, you know, it's what, it's the problem. Spotify solved,

117
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.330
making streaming like work and, uh,

118
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.630
like delays in listening to music. Cause a huge negative,

119
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.190
even like slight delays. But here you're saying, I mean,

120
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.550
how do you know when those three seconds? Okay.

121
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.690
Or you just kind of have to try it out because to me,

122
00:07:29.691 --> 00:07:31.940
my intuition would be,

123
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.910
those three seconds would kill the app.

124
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.490
Like I would try to do the open GL thing. Right.

125
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:42.320
<v 1>So I wish I were that smart at the time. Um,</v>

126
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:47.600
I wasn't, I just knew how to do what I knew how to do. Right. And I decided,

127
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:52.250
okay, like why don't I just iterate over the values and change them?

128
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:55.160
And what's interesting is that, um,

129
00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.290
compared to the alternatives, no one else used open jail, right.

130
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.690
So everyone else was doing the dumb way. And in fact,

131
00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:05.240
they were doing it at a high resolution.

132
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.800
Now comes in the small resolution that we'll talk about assess, um,

133
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.640
by choosing 512 pixels by 512 pixels,

134
00:08:13.641 --> 00:08:18.560
which I believe it was at the time we iterated over a lot fewer pixels than our

135
00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:22.790
competitors who were trying to do these enormous output like images.

136
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:27.770
So instead of taking 20 seconds, I mean, three seconds feels pretty good. Right.

137
00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.850
So on a relative basis we were winning like a lot. Okay.

138
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:35.300
So that sends our number one, answer. Number two is, uh,

139
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:38.150
we actually focused on latency in the right places.

140
00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:42.920
So we did this really wonderful thing, um, when you uploaded. So,

141
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.860
uh, the way it would work is, you know, you'd take your phone,

142
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.340
you take the photo and then you'd go to the, um,

143
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.370
you'd go to the edit screen where you would caption it.

144
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:57.030
And on that caption and start typing, you think, okay,

145
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.150
like what's a clever caption. And I said to Mike, Hey,

146
00:09:00.151 --> 00:09:01.410
when I worked on the GML team,

147
00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:04.860
you know what they did when you typed in your username or your email address,

148
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:10.080
even before you've entered in your password, like the chant probability,

149
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.340
once you enter in your username that you're going to actually sign in is

150
00:09:14.341 --> 00:09:18.240
extremely high. So why not just start loading your account in the background?

151
00:09:18.241 --> 00:09:23.040
Not, not like sending it down to the desktop, that would be a security, uh, uh,

152
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:27.600
issue, but like loaded into memory on the server, like, get it ready,

153
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:32.340
prepare it. I just thought that was so fascinating unintuitive. And I was like,

154
00:09:32.341 --> 00:09:35.820
Mike, why don't we just do that? But like, we'll just upload the photo and like,

155
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.790
assume you're going to upload the photo.

156
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.940
Maybe you don't forget about it. We'll delete it. Right.

157
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.370
So what ended up happening was people would caption their, uh,

158
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.290
photo they'd press done or upload,

159
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:52.200
and you'd see those little progress bar just go through.

160
00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:58.020
And it was lightning fast. Okay. We were no faster than anyone else at the time.

161
00:09:58.021 --> 00:10:02.400
But by choosing five, 12 by five 12 and doing in the background,

162
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:07.080
it almost guaranteed that it was done by the time you captioned and everyone,

163
00:10:07.081 --> 00:10:11.580
when they used, it was like, how the hell is this thing so fast?

164
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.240
But we were slow. We just hit the slowness. It wasn't like,

165
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.250
as things are just like as a Shelley game,

166
00:10:17.251 --> 00:10:20.850
you're just hiding the latency that,

167
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.570
that mattered to people like a lot. And I think that,

168
00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:29.160
so you were willing to put up with a slow filter if it meant you could share it

169
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.290
immediately. And of course we added sharing options,

170
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:35.850
which let you distribute it really quickly. That was the third part. Um,

171
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.610
so latency matters, but relative to what,

172
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.430
and then there's some like tricks you could get around to just hiding the

173
00:10:44.431 --> 00:10:45.810
latency. Um, like,

174
00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:49.260
I don't know if Spotify starts downloading the next song eagerly.

175
00:10:49.261 --> 00:10:53.940
I'm assuming they do their bunch of ideas here that are not rocket

176
00:10:53.941 --> 00:10:56.040
science that, that really help.

177
00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:01.530
<v 0>And all of that was stuff you were explicitly having a discussion about like</v>

178
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.580
the, those designs and argument you were having, like arguments discussions.

179
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.530
<v 1>Sure. It was arguments. I mean, I'm not sure if you've met my co-founder Mike,</v>

180
00:11:10.531 --> 00:11:14.280
but he's a pretty nice guy and he's very reasonable. And, uh,

181
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.650
and we both just saw eye to eye and we were like, yeah,

182
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:20.370
it's like make this fast or at least seem fast.

183
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.510
It'll be great. I mean, honestly I think the most contentious thing,

184
00:11:24.511 --> 00:11:29.220
and he would say this too initially was, um,

185
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.060
I was on an iPhone 3g, so like the, not so fast one.

186
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:37.020
And he had a brand new iPhone four. I was cheap. Nice. Um,

187
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.170
and his feed loaded super smoothly,

188
00:11:40.171 --> 00:11:44.970
like when he would scroll from photo to photo buttery smooth. Right.

189
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:49.140
But on my phone, every time you got to a new photo, it was like chunk cut,

190
00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:53.010
chunk, allocate memory, like all this stuff. Right. I was like, Mike,

191
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.720
that's unacceptable. And he's like, oh, come on, man. Just like,

192
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:57.400
upgrade your phone. Basically.

193
00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:01.360
You didn't actually say that he was nicer than that. Um, but I could tell,

194
00:12:01.361 --> 00:12:03.880
he wished like I would just stop being cheap and just got a new phone.

195
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.620
But what's funny is we actually sat there working on that little detail for a

196
00:12:08.621 --> 00:12:12.850
few days before launch and that polished

197
00:12:12.851 --> 00:12:13.660
experience.

198
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.860
Plus the fact that uploading seemed fast for all these people who didn't have

199
00:12:17.861 --> 00:12:18.730
nice phones,

200
00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:23.950
I think meant a lot because far too often you see teams focused,

201
00:12:23.951 --> 00:12:25.480
not on performance.

202
00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:29.710
They focus on what's the cool computer science problem they can solve.

203
00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:33.520
Right. Can we scale this thing to a billion users?

204
00:12:33.521 --> 00:12:36.340
And they've got like a hundred, right? Yeah.

205
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.300
You talked about loss function. So I want to come back to that.

206
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:45.130
Like the loss function is like, do you provide a great, happy,

207
00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:48.700
magical whatever experience for the consumer? And listen,

208
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:52.150
if it happens to involve something complex and technical and great,

209
00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.690
but it turns out, I think most of the time

210
00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.280
those experiences are just sitting there waiting to be built with like,

211
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:03.610
not that complex solutions. Uh,

212
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.430
but everyone is just like so stuck in their own head that they have to

213
00:13:06.431 --> 00:13:09.310
over-engineer everything. And then they forget about the easy stuff.

214
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.210
<v 0>So maybe to flip the loss function there is,</v>

215
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.920
you're trying to minimize the number of times you there's unpleasant

216
00:13:17.921 --> 00:13:19.660
experience, right? Like, uh,

217
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:21.820
the one you mentioned where when you go to the next photo,

218
00:13:21.821 --> 00:13:23.800
it freezes for a little bit. So it's,

219
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.990
it's almost as opposed to maximizing pleasure.

220
00:13:25.991 --> 00:13:30.490
It's probably easier to minimize the number of like the friction.

221
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.820
<v 1>Yeah. And as we all know, you just, you just, uh,</v>

222
00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:38.230
you just make the pleasure negative and then minimize everything. So we're.

223
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:39.310
<v 0>Mapping this all back to.</v>

224
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:42.220
<v 1>You on that works, but actually, can I say one thing on that, which is,</v>

225
00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.520
I don't know a lot about machine learning, but I feel like I've,

226
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:50.350
I've tried studying a bunch that whole idea of reinforcement

227
00:13:50.351 --> 00:13:54.850
learning and planning out more than the greedy single

228
00:13:54.851 --> 00:13:56.560
experience I think is,

229
00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.660
is the closest you can get to like ideal product

230
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:05.590
design thinking where you're not saying, Hey, like,

231
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:09.130
can we have a great experience just this one time? But like,

232
00:14:09.131 --> 00:14:11.320
what is the right way to onboard someone?

233
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:16.330
What series of experiences correlate most with them hanging on longterm?

234
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:21.520
Right. So not just saying, oh, did the photo load slowly a couple of times,

235
00:14:21.521 --> 00:14:25.420
or did they get a great photo at the top of their feed? But like,

236
00:14:25.421 --> 00:14:29.440
what are the things that are going to make this person come back over the next

237
00:14:29.441 --> 00:14:33.670
week, over the next month? And as a product designer asking yourself, okay,

238
00:14:33.671 --> 00:14:37.960
I want to optimize not just minimize bad experiences in the short run, but like,

239
00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.130
how do I get someone to engage over the next month?

240
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.890
And I'm not going to claim at all that I,

241
00:14:44.891 --> 00:14:47.620
that I thought that way at all at the time. Cause I certainly didn't.

242
00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:50.980
But if I were going back and giving myself any advice, it would be,

243
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.740
what are those? What are those second order effects that you can create?

244
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.660
And it turns out having your friends on the service is an enormous win.

245
00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:03.770
So starting with a very small group of people that produce content that you

246
00:15:03.771 --> 00:15:07.550
wanted to see, which we did, we seated the community very well,

247
00:15:07.551 --> 00:15:11.150
I think ended up mattering. And so.
