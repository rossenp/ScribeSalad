1
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.840
<v 0>Just so many interesting papers, uh, there, like, uh,</v>

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.520
I remember reading the paper that was written by Freeman Dyson on the,

3
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.480
like the, the first time that he explained,

4
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.000
or he came up with a concept of the Dyson sphere mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and he,

5
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.320
he, he put that out. Like it's, again, it's one page paper. Um, and he,

6
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.950
what he explained was that eventually if, uh,

7
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.030
a civilization develops and, and, and grows,

8
00:00:28.031 --> 00:00:32.750
there's gonna be a point where when the resources on the planet are not,

9
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.470
are not enough for the energy requirements of that civilization.

10
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.670
<v 3>So if you wanna go,</v>

11
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.830
the next step is you need to go to the next star and the extract energy from

12
00:00:41.831 --> 00:00:43.470
that star. And the,

13
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.860
a way to do it is you need to build some sort of cap around the star that

14
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.540
extracts the energy. So he, he theorized this idea of the,

15
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.780
the Dyson sphere mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and he went on to kind of analyze how he

16
00:00:55.781 --> 00:00:58.260
would build that, the stability of that sphere.

17
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.740
<v 0>Like if something happens, like there's like a small OSCI with the,</v>

18
00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:04.650
that fear collapse into the star, or know what,

19
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.010
what would happen and even went on to, uh,

20
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.930
kind of say that a good way for us to look for signs of intelligent life out

21
00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:17.130
there is to look for signals of these, uh, Dyson spheres mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

22
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.370
And because, you know, according to the law of, uh,

23
00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:21.930
second law of thermodynamics, like these, there's gonna be some,

24
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.370
a lot of infrared radiation,

25
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:26.880
there is gonna be admitted as a consequence of extracting energy from the star

26
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.460
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

27
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.320
And we should be able to see those signals of like infrared,

28
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:34.120
if we look at the sky, but all these, like,

29
00:01:34.121 --> 00:01:38.040
from the introduction of the concept, like the pro, how to build a DYS sphere,

30
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.760
the problems of like having a DYS sphere,

31
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.720
how to detect how that could be used as a signal for intelligence life, wait,

32
00:01:43.721 --> 00:01:47.310
really that's all in the paper in one, like one page paper, and it's like,

33
00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:50.070
it's it's for me, it's beautiful. It's like, where was this published?

34
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.463
I don't remember.

35
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.150
<v 1>It's fascinating that papers like that could be, yeah. I mean, the guts,</v>

36
00:01:56.151 --> 00:02:00.510
it takes to put that all together in a paper form, you know, that,

37
00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:04.310
that kind of challenges our previous discussion, that of paper. I mean,

38
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.740
papers can be beautiful. You can play with the format, right. It.

39
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.740
<v 0>But there's a lot to unpack there. That's like the, the, the that's the,</v>

40
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.700
the starting point, but it's, it's,

41
00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:16.500
it's beautiful that you're able to put that in one page, uh,

42
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.140
and then people can build on top of that. And, but the key.

43
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.700
<v 1>Ideas are there. Yeah, exactly. What about, have you looked at any of the,</v>

44
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.530
the big seminal papers throughout the history of science?

45
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.770
Like you look at simple, like Einstein papers mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; are any,

46
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.410
have any of those been annotated?

47
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.970
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah, no, we, we have some more seminal papers that,</v>

48
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.130
of that people will have heard about. Um, you know, we have the, the DNA,

49
00:02:42.131 --> 00:02:44.050
double EICs paper on there.

50
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.840
We have the Higgs bow on &lt;affirmative&gt; mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, uh, paper. Um,

51
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.000
yeah, there there's papers that, that, that we know that it's,

52
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.000
they're not gonna be finding out about them because of us,

53
00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.880
but it's papers that we think.

54
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.000
<v 0>Um, should be more widely read and that folks would benefit from having some</v>

55
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:06.680
annotations there. And so we also have a number of those,

56
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.800
a lot of like discovery papers for fundamental, like S and all that. There,

57
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.480
we have a lot of those on from us library. Um, yeah, we, I,

58
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.440
I would like to en we haven't annotated that one,

59
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:19.550
but I would like to on the reman hypotheses,

60
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.470
that's an really interesting paper as well. Um, and, and,

61
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.230
but we haven't annotated that one,

62
00:03:25.231 --> 00:03:30.150
but there's a lot of like more historical landmark papers, um, on the platform.
