1
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.660
<v 0>So you said these books are difficult.</v>

2
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.860
Maybe you can comment on which aspect is difficult.

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.820
Is it just the technical nature? Is it the length?

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.060
Is it the depth of the ideas or how long it takes to integrate them?

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.780
And more sort of importantly,

6
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.420
is there recommendation advice you can give on how to

7
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.250
integrate these ideas, how to read &lt;laugh&gt;,

8
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.370
how to learn in the space. Is there from your own life,

9
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.690
like how do you enjoy taking in ideas? And this could be for these books,

10
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.410
but also, uh, in the Bitcoin world and reading a bunch of different ideas,

11
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.370
uh, written by others, just integrating stuff, uh,

12
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.720
even watching pot CA and all those kinds of things.

13
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.640
<v 1>Yeah. I I'm a reader. I love to read. Um,</v>

14
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.000
one of the most useful things I've ever done was take a speed reading course.

15
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.240
I actually think there's a version of this available on Tim Ferris's website.

16
00:00:57.241 --> 00:01:00.760
It's like a 30 minute speed reading course. It's all about high movement.

17
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.000
Instead of moving your eye continuously line over line,

18
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.150
it's more about jumping in your brain.

19
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.670
You can train your brain to just absorb words in their totality versus kind of

20
00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:11.504
reading word by word.

21
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.030
<v 0>And also not I've I haven't fully taken that journey actually, but, uh,</v>

22
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.470
I remember taking a few steps on that journey,

23
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.430
realizing that I'm speaking inside my head. Yeah.

24
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.700
I'm saying the words inside of my head and that's actually getting in the way

25
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.380
that's right. So there's a lot of little hacks like that.

26
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.460
I maybe lazy I'll have to, now that you mentioned I'll have to revisit this.

27
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.040
Yeah.

28
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.980
But I have convinced myself that I don't need to read faster because that's not

29
00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:43.820
ultimately the bottleneck, the bottleneck is in the me thinking about stuff.

30
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.610
In fact, I like reading with really slowly or so.

31
00:01:46.611 --> 00:01:49.330
I convinced myself &lt;laugh&gt; because I ultimately,

32
00:01:49.331 --> 00:01:51.090
it's not about gaining more information.

33
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.890
It's about time spent thinking deeply. Yes, yes. Um,

34
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.850
but maybe that's just me being very lazy cuz yes, it's true.

35
00:01:59.851 --> 00:02:02.490
It's important to think deeply, but maybe I could speed up the,

36
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.650
the consumption of information. Well.

37
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.360
<v 1>It's fine. It's I, I, I like to be dynamic actually. So, um,</v>

38
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.000
usually speed reading initially and that diffused that internal dialogue for me.

39
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.040
Cuz when I was reading one word at a time, I was having that two,

40
00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:17.600
you almost get a feedback in your own head.

41
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.880
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you're reading the word out loud and it's shouting your

42
00:02:19.881 --> 00:02:22.400
thoughts. Yeah. If you're speed or reading, you can't do that. Yeah. You just,

43
00:02:22.401 --> 00:02:26.470
you're taking in groups of words at a time. So you can't uh, you know,

44
00:02:26.471 --> 00:02:30.950
internally verbalize it I guess. And then I also am really big on annotating,

45
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.830
underlining writing in the margins. Uh, I prefer a physical book,

46
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.470
but I also read the Kindle a lot cuz it's just so convenient, you know,

47
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.950
anywhere you're waiting in line or every night before bed,

48
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.350
I'm reading my Kindle. Um, and I also advocate rereading a lot.

49
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.020
So if you, on something that, you know, struck you at a deep level,

50
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.980
you found particularly fascinating. Like you have to listen to that,

51
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.860
that's your, I don't know your mind or your spirit signal,

52
00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.120
that that is something meaningful to you and you should, you know,

53
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.640
to your point, reread it, sit with it for a long time, write about it.

54
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.640
Um, and that,

55
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.720
that becomes the ultimate triumvirate of, of synthesizing an idea.

56
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.081
Actually,

57
00:03:13.081 --> 00:03:18.080
if you can read about it and then write about it and then go

58
00:03:18.081 --> 00:03:21.150
and talk about it, you get this crystallization of understanding.

59
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.790
That's just not possible doing any one of the three or any two of the three. Um,

60
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.150
so I definitely highly recommend people to do that. Um,

61
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.270
and in terms of how are those books difficult? I mean, in every way,

62
00:03:35.271 --> 00:03:37.510
they're all long books. Uh,

63
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.700
in terms of density,

64
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.340
I would say Lila is the less the least dense,

65
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.300
maybe maps of meaning. I don't know,

66
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.780
but maps of meaning and human action are both extremely dense,

67
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.900
but they're just you, I had to read those books very slow.

68
00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.300
You just have to take your time with 'em. Um, to,

69
00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:01.650
to give you an idea with Jordan, Peter, he said this a lot with maps of meaning.

70
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.730
He spent three hours a day writing for 15 years to write that book.

71
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.370
It's probably, I think it's a 600 page book. He said he estimates,

72
00:04:10.371 --> 00:04:11.930
he rewrote every sentence in the book,

73
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.050
50 times five zero to try and get it, you know, just perfected.

74
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.240
And when you read these sentences, he &lt;affirmative&gt;,

75
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.040
you can tell that he rewrote it 50 times.

76
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.320
<v 0>I've uh, I've used actually in for space repetition. Um,</v>

77
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.880
it's like a piece of it's an app. I'm not sure if you're familiar with it,

78
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.440
but it allows you to load in, uh,

79
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.320
facts or terms or entire paragraphs.

80
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.710
And then it brings them, uh,

81
00:04:43.711 --> 00:04:47.350
you review them every day mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then it brings them up less

82
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.390
and less often over time. Hmm.

83
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.190
As you show yourself being able to remember the thing that, uh,

84
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.550
you wanted to memorize and oftentimes what I'm reading,

85
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.830
what I want to memorize is the key idea. Uh,

86
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:02.740
but also like I use it for I'm terrible with names.

87
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.740
So I started to use it for names too, of names of people, names of, uh,

88
00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.020
like people that I wanna remember. Yeah.

89
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.100
And also throughout history and also my own personal life, but also events,

90
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.620
you know, dates to me are usually not important,

91
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.940
but sometimes dates are really important. Mm. And so it's really useful.

92
00:05:19.941 --> 00:05:24.610
I recommend highly Naval think mentioned a piece of software called

93
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.330
read wise or something like that. That I hope I'm saying that correctly.

94
00:05:30.331 --> 00:05:31.164
It's something like that.

95
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.290
And what it does is it goes to your highlights from your Kindle

96
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.370
or the various places where you highlight stuff that integrates, um,

97
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.440
the good reads and it does the same kind of space repetition,

98
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.960
but for things you've highlighted. Mm that's super cool.

99
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.760
It's it sends an email every day and it's been really,

100
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.440
I recommend it highly cuz it,

101
00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.120
it send like to me in email form a selection of the

102
00:06:00.121 --> 00:06:03.760
things I've highlighted in previous things I've read and it's like this weird,

103
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:04.703
like

104
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.800
shock shock to your memory of that sprinkles. Like I'll have a,

105
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.160
I have way probably way too much Orwell in there. And it just kind of like,

106
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.790
it brings you back and these years there, because what you realize,

107
00:06:18.791 --> 00:06:22.830
depending on how you highlight, but at least for me,

108
00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.470
and I think it's probably true for a lot of people,

109
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.470
the things you've highlighted had at that moment and like an emotional impact on

110
00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:29.310
you. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah.

111
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.950
And so like these things are just like hitting you hard again. Yeah. It's like,

112
00:06:32.951 --> 00:06:37.380
whoa. Uh, it might not be meaningful to anyone else except you. And it, uh,

113
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.700
it's something I recommend,

114
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.380
you never know with these like hacks or tools and so on.

115
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.980
Like what's actually BS and what, what is amazing.

116
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.740
And that one is kind of amazing. So at least for me it,

117
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.940
it works for me in Naval. I think I think's the one read wise,

118
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.260
you said read wise. Yeah, I definitely. Or something close to that. Yeah.

119
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.490
It could be read something else, like wealth or something.

120
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.410
<v 1>Uh, the one other thing I, I really like,</v>

121
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.250
and this is more of a new one is I used to always listen to music at the gym

122
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.130
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but now I've just cuz I'm so backlogged on podcast. Right.

123
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.530
They're just, there's so many,

124
00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.010
I exclusively listen to podcasts when I'm walking or when I'm at the gym,

125
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.240
anytime I'm doing something that I can't know read basically.

126
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.400
And I think there's something really special about exercise and ideation

127
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.000
&lt;laugh&gt;. I mean, I, I don't know if this happens to everyone,

128
00:07:28.001 --> 00:07:30.880
but my creative juices just go ballistic when I'm at the gym.

129
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:35.080
Like I hit a certain point of, I guess, heart rate and you're sweating enough,

130
00:07:35.081 --> 00:07:39.390
then it, the ideas just start to flow. Yeah. So I'm basically at the gym now,

131
00:07:39.391 --> 00:07:40.350
listening to podcasts,

132
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:45.110
exercise is as fast as I can to try to get to that state of, um,

133
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.710
you know, where you're diss STR your strenuous exercise, I guess you would say.

134
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.070
And then I'm end up typing notes into my phone as fast as I can with all these

135
00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.470
ideas that are flowing. So I've, I've created a lot of good writing out of that.

136
00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.940
<v 0>It's it's kind of, so I, I do running, uh, quite a bit,</v>

137
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.180
so running outside and uh,

138
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.140
I'll listen to &lt;laugh&gt; I've been okay.

139
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.340
I told myself this has been going on for about a year. Uh,

140
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.140
is I only listen like the,

141
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:18.540
the stuff that's either world war II or world war I related. So Hitler, Stalin,

142
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.010
like, like difficult historical stuff. Um,

143
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:29.970
and also listen to brown noise. So those are the two modes.

144
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:34.730
So brown noise helps me. It's like white noise, but like deeper,

145
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:38.930
I guess it helps me remove the world. And at the gym,

146
00:08:38.931 --> 00:08:42.120
there's a lot of distrac when you're running. There's a lot of distractions.

147
00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:43.240
It helps me remove the world.

148
00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:47.840
So one I'll be listening to difficult historical ideas.

149
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.280
And then when my mind is all of a sudden starting to generate ideas,

150
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:56.480
I'll listen to brown noise and I'll then force myself to think it's kind of,

151
00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:02.760
it's meditative in a sense. And your mind wants to be lazy. You want to,

152
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.120
you, it's hard, man,

153
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:09.760
like running and thinking in the sense that some of the ideas that come into

154
00:09:09.761 --> 00:09:12.840
your head are pretty heavy. Uh it's about your own life.

155
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.990
It's all your own demons come. Yeah.

156
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.870
But also just difficult ideas that require you thinking through and

157
00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:20.990
persevering through that.

158
00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:24.510
Like not letting yourself get lazy and like thinking through it has,

159
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.270
has been really, for me, rewarding in the same way that you're,

160
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:32.150
you're saying is it is for you. It's true that like podcasts and music,

161
00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:33.630
like, um, shallow,

162
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:38.740
like funny podcast or music have been a kind of filler distraction,

163
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.100
but informational podcasts,

164
00:09:42.101 --> 00:09:47.060
like podcasts that have some depths of ideas or audio books have been,

165
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.133
uh, truly rewarding.

166
00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.180
I try to listen now less and less to podcasts that are just fun.

167
00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:55.060
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; cuz I feel like I enjoy too much.

168
00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.930
Don't allow my mind to get bored and to think through stuff mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;

169
00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:03.370
to, uh, to explore ideas. Yeah. It's so easy to fill the, the space

170
00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.010
that, uh, usually would be thought filled with thought instead,

171
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.250
fill it with fun podcasts.

172
00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:13.450
Like there's a bunch of comedy podcasts I really enjoy.

173
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:15.970
So there's value to that. Of course. But you,

174
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.240
you have to realize it's entertainment. It's not, uh, it's, it's not, um,

175
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.760
you don't get much value except entertainment.

176
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.800
<v 1>Right, right. And there's utility to the boredom too.</v>

177
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.600
I think where to give your mind the space,

178
00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.240
I guess your subconscious, maybe the space to chew on some of these problems,

179
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.670
right? Where you've I embodied so much knowledge, you know,

180
00:10:37.671 --> 00:10:38.990
you've highlighted and thought about something,

181
00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:42.190
but then you need to stop thinking about it for a while and let it marinate in

182
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:45.430
the subconscious. And then, you know,

183
00:10:45.431 --> 00:10:47.510
these flashes of insight that people have described.

184
00:10:47.511 --> 00:10:49.070
Sometimes I get 'em in the middle of the night.

185
00:10:49.071 --> 00:10:51.590
Like I just wake up from a dream and have them and I gotta write it down or

186
00:10:51.591 --> 00:10:54.150
sometimes it's, uh, in nature taking a walk.

187
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.910
But I think that's very important too.

188
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:59.740
We can't just brute force our way into understanding, you know,

189
00:10:59.741 --> 00:11:03.580
there's this interplay between kind of the brute force reading intake and then

190
00:11:03.581 --> 00:11:07.700
just relaxing, meditating, sleeping, being bored, uh,

191
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:10.940
letting your subconscious do the, the heavy.

192
00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.860
<v 0>Lifting. And there's a, like,</v>

193
00:11:12.861 --> 00:11:16.620
you should be aware of the fact that there's a war for your attention going on.

194
00:11:16.621 --> 00:11:17.500
So there's a lot of,

195
00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:22.730
there's been better and better and better mechanisms that are designed to steal

196
00:11:22.731 --> 00:11:23.564
your attention.

197
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:28.130
So I kind of see it as a war zone between my right,

198
00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:33.570
for boredom and the internet wanting your attention. In fact, um,

199
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.930
clubhouse as an app has been,

200
00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:42.600
I'm not gonna use clubhouse much anymore cuz there's some aspect of my own inner

201
00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:47.400
loneliness and whatever it is that pulled me into clubhouse a little bit too

202
00:11:47.401 --> 00:11:48.234
much to where,

203
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:53.080
where it robbed me from that lonely time alone where I sit and listen to Bruce

204
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.840
Springsteen and think about life. Right.

205
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.360
&lt;laugh&gt; so I wanna that's way more important &lt;laugh&gt; that's way. Well, yeah,

206
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.200
at least, you know, it's all in balance cuz there is uh,

207
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.360
a clubhouse like a lot of these social networks when you use right.

208
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.440
Can be a way to discover new ideas,

209
00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:11.600
new people it's but the boredom and just being alone with your thoughts is,

210
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.750
uh, price us.

211
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:15.110
<v 1>Absolutely. And you gotta know yourself, right?</v>

212
00:12:15.111 --> 00:12:18.670
Like it took me a long time to realize I need solitude. Yeah.

213
00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:22.510
Like just how I'm wired, how I'm built. I need like an hour, a day solitude.

214
00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:24.430
So you gotta listen to that part of yourself.

215
00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:28.030
You might be compromising something like that where you feel like you always

216
00:12:28.031 --> 00:12:30.030
need to be with your girlfriend or whatever it may be.

217
00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:34.060
But I would suggest listening to that voice. Yeah. I.

218
00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:38.460
<v 0>Tried to &lt;laugh&gt; I tried to remember things that made me feel good over time.</v>

219
00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:43.580
Like long term had positive impact and long term had negative impact and

220
00:12:43.581 --> 00:12:46.500
do more of the former less as a latter. Yeah.

221
00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.140
We don't often &lt;laugh&gt; think like that. You know, we,

222
00:12:49.141 --> 00:12:51.620
we talked offline about like carnivore diets, for example,

223
00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.770
I try to remember that carbs. Don't make me feel good. Yeah.

224
00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:00.090
That's what's in the moment. It's hard to remember that it's hard,

225
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:04.930
but you have to remember that that that's the case and in the same way

226
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:10.210
exercise, it's hard to remember that exercise makes me feel good.

227
00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:12.570
Uh, like especially.

228
00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:14.320
<v 1>When it's time to go to the gym, especially last.</v>

229
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.020
<v 0>Time to go to the gym.</v>

230
00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:18.960
But you should remember that because the kind of person you are without exercise

231
00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:23.040
for me, just like he beautifully said that you have to know yourself,

232
00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:27.800
the kind of person I am without exercise is a less good person,

233
00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.560
a person, a person I'm less proud of.

234
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:35.670
<v 1>Yeah. The food thing is so hard by the way. I still, you know, I,</v>

235
00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:37.350
I can't tell you how many times I've learned the lesson.

236
00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:41.270
Like don't eat that &lt;laugh&gt; but then you know, you go a few weeks of not eating,

237
00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:43.990
whatever that is and you're you're feeling good. Yeah.

238
00:13:43.991 --> 00:13:46.910
And then you're you're I dunno, something creeps up inside. You're like, ah,

239
00:13:46.911 --> 00:13:49.670
you could just have one or you could just do this, but for me it's sugar.

240
00:13:49.671 --> 00:13:53.550
Like sugar just makes me feel terrible. But I always not always,

241
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:57.340
but if it's been a long time, I started to make that exception in my mind like,

242
00:13:57.341 --> 00:13:59.620
oh, you can have a little bit. Yeah. And then I eat it and I feel terrible.

243
00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.740
So I don't know how many times I've done that dance, but.

244
00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.420
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt;, it's not cool. Well, it depends on how painful it is.</v>

245
00:14:04.421 --> 00:14:06.420
And then you learn the lesson. I've I haven't,

246
00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.940
I actually embraced the fact that I'll never learn the lesson with vodka. Mm.

247
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:14.260
Every time I drink, especially with Russians &lt;laugh&gt; is like, I,

248
00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:18.450
I quit drinking every, and then I forget there's like a slow drop off.

249
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.290
It'll be like a two weeks. And then Naro.

250
00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:23.120
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

251
00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.610
<v 0>Very good. So it never makes me feel good.</v>

252
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:30.610
It never results in anything good. Um,

253
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:35.530
except the beautiful social chaos. Yeah.

254
00:14:35.531 --> 00:14:39.960
Which is a ultimately somehow there's value to chaos too. Yes. You know,

255
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.320
there there's value to that.

256
00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:45.240
Whatever the hell stupid stuff you do when you get trashed the,

257
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:49.280
over the top emotion of love usually or whatever. Yeah.

258
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.560
Camaraderie there's value to that too. Like that's as I get older,

259
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.200
I realize cuz uh, the,

260
00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.040
the world sometimes,

261
00:14:59.041 --> 00:15:01.520
especially when you get older and the world wants you to be an adult

262
00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:06.480
in order to maintain the youthful spirit, you have to use all the tools you can.

263
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:11.030
Yeah. And alcohol is one of them, right. To do all the stupid that you can,

264
00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.910
even if you're like getting older.

265
00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.190
<v 1>To lower the inhibitions and lower the, again, it's that,</v>

266
00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:18.990
that taste of uncertainty that is the sweetness of life. Right.

267
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:23.270
To be able to go out and be a flair at a party and not really know what you're

268
00:15:23.271 --> 00:15:27.230
gonna do. And it's, we, we have this draw to the wild side of life.

269
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.670
Uh, as much as we try and build up order around ourselves,

270
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.740
I think there's always gonna be an appetite for that. Um, I've always,

271
00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:38.020
most of my life, I've always been a social drinker,

272
00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:43.060
but I actually gave up alcohol a year ago. And um, I would add that to the,

273
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.500
the idea, uh,

274
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.900
the repertoire for dealing with bigger ideas because alcohol's fun.

275
00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.730
It's a me, you know, good times

276
00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:56.730
it can be analgesic. It can do all,

277
00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:59.530
you can give you all these benefits if you use, uh, in the right amounts.

278
00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:02.130
But I got to the point personally,

279
00:16:02.131 --> 00:16:05.330
where I was trying to wrestle with these ideas that are just so much bigger than

280
00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:05.891
me, that I,

281
00:16:05.891 --> 00:16:09.970
and I have this backlog of books that was growing faster than I could read them.

282
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.240
That I just reached a point where I decided, um,

283
00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:18.280
I wanted to start making sacrifices toward attaining that and alcohol was just

284
00:16:18.281 --> 00:16:20.000
an easy one, you know, it's you spend,

285
00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:23.720
even if you just drink socially on the weekends,

286
00:16:23.721 --> 00:16:28.680
you're probably spending five to 10 hours drinking and then maybe another

287
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:33.590
what? Five to 10 hours recovering perhaps on the day after &lt;affirmative&gt;. Um,

288
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:38.430
so it, it was a difficult transition initially,

289
00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:42.550
but once you get through a couple of months, I feel amazing without it,

290
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:45.630
I sleep better than ever. My workouts are better than ever.

291
00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:49.470
I'm sharper than ever. I'm more lucid. So I'm,

292
00:16:49.471 --> 00:16:51.230
I'm not trying to be a proponent for like not drinking,

293
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:52.630
but I just wanna say you're a proponent.

294
00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:54.180
<v 0>For SAC sacrifice in some I.</v>

295
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:55.980
<v 1>Sacrifice. Yes.</v>
