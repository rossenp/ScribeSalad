1
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.720
<v 0>Well, how was a Firefox born?</v>

2
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.270
How's Mozilla born? Is there a sh.

3
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.220
<v 1>There's a long story there too. So Netscape got acquired by AOL, which has,</v>

4
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.000
as I say, was a reasonable happy ending for a lot of people because Netscape,

5
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.090
otherwise was going to go out of business because Microsoft was just killing its

6
00:00:20.091 --> 00:00:22.010
market. There was no way to charge for browser.

7
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.420
Windows came with I E I four was pretty good and let's get four.

8
00:00:26.421 --> 00:00:29.210
It wasn't that good. It took a while to get better. Um,

9
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.490
but then this game executive said, let's do an open source escape pod,

10
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.920
you know, and like in star Wars, a new hope,

11
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.680
the gunner won't shoot it cause there's no lifeforms on, right.

12
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.150
It's not a threat. Uh,

13
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.710
and so when we did Mozilla in 1998 and it looked like it was going

14
00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:49.490
to, you know, initially just give the world of open-source browser,

15
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.180
but it's really hard to get people to work on this sort of hairball had been

16
00:00:53.181 --> 00:00:56.840
hacked up over by that point for years. Uh,

17
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.190
it also couldn't have the crypto module for secure sockets so-called or now

18
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.100
transport layer security. That was an electronic munition.

19
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.210
We're not allowed to release that in the full 1000,

20
00:01:08.211 --> 00:01:12.710
24 bit keen strength. And, um, yet people,

21
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.500
one of whom I happened to meet previously at SGI,

22
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.150
when I went on a sales support engineering trip, uh, Tim Hudson in Brisbane,

23
00:01:20.151 --> 00:01:22.940
Australia, and, um, Eric,

24
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.150
a young did what became open SSL.

25
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.100
It was called SSL EA why after Eric's initials and Tim and Eric

26
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.540
took their openness of sell outside of the purview of the NSA and the

27
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.630
department of commerce. And they stuck it into Muzzillo's code.

28
00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:41.750
And that was perhaps the best hack that was done in the first few months after

29
00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:45.140
we opened sourced the browser, we had other problems,

30
00:01:45.141 --> 00:01:48.080
the politics inside Netscape were driven by these acquisitions.

31
00:01:48.081 --> 00:01:52.130
So the one acquisition that kind of messed up Netscape for also wanted to keep

32
00:01:52.131 --> 00:01:56.270
doing a proprietary mail and group ware program,

33
00:01:56.271 --> 00:01:59.750
not Jamie is the one skis mail program that was in Netscape two and three,

34
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.470
and they held it back. We're open source. We didn't have a mail program.

35
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.410
It was just a browser. We didn't know what Ella will do to us.

36
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.480
It turns out they didn't interfere with us for a long time,

37
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.680
but Netscape wasn't the best steward of Mozilla.

38
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.130
We were operating Mozilla as a pirate ship without a legal entity.

39
00:02:16.131 --> 00:02:20.990
So most of us worked for Netscape under a separate organization. And,

40
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.130
um, initially, uh, the first engineering manager,

41
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.510
Tom Payclin of Netscape was the muzzle founding manager, but he,

42
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.360
he left pretty quickly and he left me as the acting manager,

43
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.920
which is more like method acting in my case. And, um, and I did,

44
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.590
that was my first management stint, but then, um,

45
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.650
someone who'd written the licenses, Mitchell Baker,

46
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.180
she was a lawyer and Netscape. She was involved in the open source license, uh,

47
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.150
decision making and the actual writing and construction of those licenses.

48
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.700
That was Mitchell's job Netscape, public license,

49
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.040
and the truly open Mozilla public license.

50
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.250
And there were two because Netscape needed because of some encumbered code

51
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.370
needed some special, but that went away over time.

52
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.940
Mitchell was almost interested in Mozilla and she came back from maternity leave

53
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:06.640
and she said, Oh, I'll be the manager if you want. And, and Jamie and I said,

54
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:10.600
sure. And then Jamie, quit. He quit after a year. He said, this didn't work.

55
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:14.680
I'm sorry. You know, he acted like it was a total failure because most of all,

56
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.940
it didn't restart the browser market, but there's no way it could have. Right.

57
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.260
And Netscape was still shipping variants and Netscape four,

58
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.450
which was based on the old code Mozilla was trying to react to the code to make

59
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:30.640
Greenfield for developers. So it was one of my big goals.

60
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:33.340
It wasn't a technical goal so much as again, a social goal.

61
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.160
People wanted a more standard spaced browser.

62
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:40.810
They wanted less of a hairball that hacked on by X grad students starting four

63
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:44.830
years prior. So we said, we're going to make a modular code base.

64
00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:48.400
We're going to use a variant or an open source version of Microsoft component.

65
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:53.170
Object model has referenced counting and standardized the tables,

66
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.070
virtual calls in C plus plus. And we're going to use a JavaScript.

67
00:03:57.071 --> 00:03:58.450
We're going to have a bridge between those two.

68
00:03:58.451 --> 00:04:02.110
So you can script those components, just like Java components. Um,

69
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.160
we're going to make a portable front end with a markup language for the user

70
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.400
user interface, not tables, not HTML, but custom, you know,

71
00:04:09.401 --> 00:04:12.160
menus and drop-downs and toolbars. And,

72
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.460
and that was called Zul XML, user interface language,

73
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.110
and some real talent on the Netscape side deliver that Dave Hyatt, who, uh,

74
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:24.220
was instrumental in Zola, Chris Waterson, um, Joe Hewitt, um,

75
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.580
Blake Ross, and th uh, Blake was an intern.

76
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.650
He was like a high school aged intern in that school.

77
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.600
And at some point we were innovating rapidly in the Muslim world.

78
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.100
And Netscape was still caught up in this management mess from these acquisitions

79
00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:40.180
and it wasn't delivering.

80
00:04:40.181 --> 00:04:43.330
And every year they were wondering if AOL was going to come and start beheading

81
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:45.430
the executives, because it didn't do anything useful.

82
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.000
And there was a thought you should take the Netscape browser engine and put it

83
00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:50.470
in the windows AOL client,

84
00:04:50.471 --> 00:04:54.430
which was the dialogue client that all the increasingly aging users of all or

85
00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:57.580
using never happened. It would have been a bit too big to change.

86
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.670
So it wasn't clear why LL bought Netscape. Let's just say they left it alone,

87
00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:04.180
but Netscape didn't leave Mozilla alone. And so, um,

88
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.520
in 2001, uh, Mitchell called me up and said, I'm no longer employed.

89
00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:11.890
And I was like, what? You quit? No, no, this wasn't my choice.

90
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.720
And there was a layoff, uh,

91
00:05:13.721 --> 00:05:16.270
which maybe accidentally or on purpose got rid of Mitchell.

92
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.400
But the funny thing was we had an open source project.

93
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:22.510
We had a lot of the engineers on staff on our side, and we had, um,

94
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.020
people we'd hired through them as little community were top-notch,

95
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:28.390
they'd written, you know, they came in high quality,

96
00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:32.170
they knew the code and they actually were better than the average or median hire

97
00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:33.004
of Netscape.

98
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.020
And so the funny thing was the executive who thought they'd

99
00:05:38.021 --> 00:05:41.860
gotten rid of Mitchell and the layoff on the next week's community call around

100
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.810
muzzle and what to do there's Mitchell.

101
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.540
<v 2>And so this show, you can kind of transcend.</v>

102
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.050
<v 1>Your, uh, you know, boundaries of corporate open source.</v>

103
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.500
If you get a project that has enough loyalty, even among the paid staff.

104
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.320
Cause we had outside people contributing with people at red hat and few other

105
00:05:57.321 --> 00:06:00.050
places, but the majority of the hackers were employed by Netscape.

106
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.070
But a lot of them at that point had had come from the community and others got

107
00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:05.450
the community and wanted to work with it.

108
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.750
And it was really the weakest engineers and Netscape didn't like Mozilla.

109
00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:13.040
And didn't like the crucible of competing with the better, uh,

110
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.370
programmers. So that's, the project is good enough. It will arise.

111
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:19.520
The Phoenix will rise out of the that's exactly right. And so we had this,

112
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:21.650
this Mozilla code base that was getting better. In fact,

113
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.300
I think at some point in 2002,

114
00:06:23.301 --> 00:06:27.290
when we declared w most a little one O w I engineer roadmap that

115
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.800
successively through similar sort of six week, five week releases,

116
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.300
like we all do with browser releases nowadays Chrome does and Firefox, um,

117
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.170
Braves, the three weeks we, we, we got to a point where we said, you know what?

118
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.950
It doesn't suck. This is like the one Oh that you want to release,

119
00:06:42.951 --> 00:06:46.010
because if you hold it back any longer to Polish, it you're denying others.

120
00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:47.750
The ability to use it. It's like pro engineer,

121
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:52.400
the mechanical CAD tool embedded the code. They embedded the layout engine.

122
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.720
Um, and Mozilla one, Oh, was like a Netscape communication suite.

123
00:06:56.721 --> 00:07:00.920
We had at that point, gotten mail people to reintegrate, mail and news.

124
00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:05.540
And we had an editor for HTML and it felt like a nineties sweet,

125
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:06.980
sweet, where, um,

126
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.540
and it felt kind of bloated and the people who were taking that Mozilla open

127
00:07:11.541 --> 00:07:16.270
source and then adding Netscape flavor to it calling the shots, right.

128
00:07:16.271 --> 00:07:19.390
And they were also under ALS thumb a little bit. And that they said, well,

129
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.870
we should probably put the AOL instant messenger chicklet on the toolbar.

130
00:07:22.871 --> 00:07:26.860
And we should put the ICQ, the other messages that AOL had acquired,

131
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.320
we should put the ICQ button on the toolbar.

132
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.730
And pretty soon Netscape looked like a bit of a NASCAR badged

133
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:39.490
Mazola, and that also made Mozilla more popular. And, and yet, um, they,

134
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.760
they had, you know, contrived to, um,

135
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.860
fire or lay off the leader. And, and,

136
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:49.650
and we carried on with an open-source structure where Maslow was still in,

137
00:07:49.651 --> 00:07:54.190
you know, Mitchell was calling sort of management or project level shots.

138
00:07:54.191 --> 00:07:58.600
And I was calling technical shots. And, um, we,

139
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.910
we had a popular suite, but we thought,

140
00:08:00.911 --> 00:08:04.930
why not make it just a browser because it'll be simpler, it'll do one job well,

141
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.260
and even then we can strip it down by half having extensions.

142
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.690
So Dave Hyatt and Blake Ross,

143
00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:14.830
the high school aged intern did the first version,

144
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.490
which was called most of the loss slash browser. It was very small group of us,

145
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.890
Ian Hixson, EISA thoughts, or me, and, uh,

146
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:25.210
Joe Hewitt and Hyatt and Blake and, and they, and high.

147
00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.630
It was really the senior hacker. He'd done all these things like amazing, uh,

148
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:33.130
cross-platform menus through the user interface, markup language. Um,

149
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.030
and he knew how to do tab browsing and implemented it natively on Macalester at

150
00:08:37.031 --> 00:08:41.890
the time in Camino, um, originally called Kymera he'd,

151
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:46.090
he'd written multiple flotations, which was a thing programmers should do.

152
00:08:46.091 --> 00:08:49.150
It's like the VA team did for those missing years when the rest of the Chrome

153
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.110
team's like where's V8. Um, at that Dave's wife,

154
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.620
Rebecca told me a story about when they were at UIC.

155
00:08:55.621 --> 00:08:58.860
They were also university of Illinois, uh, grad students. Um,

156
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.090
there was an assignment,

157
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:02.610
it was a programming assignment to do the end of the semester.

158
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.600
And Dave's friend was this, I'm going to go think,

159
00:09:06.601 --> 00:09:09.210
and I'm going to design and I'm going to make this, you know,

160
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.040
platonic perfect form of the program.

161
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:13.770
And then I'm going to write it at the end when it's due and high,

162
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:15.660
it just went there and started hacking. He wrote one version,

163
00:09:15.661 --> 00:09:16.470
you wrote a second version,

164
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.160
third version end of the semester comes around the friends, not two and two.

165
00:09:20.161 --> 00:09:22.530
Well, it wasn't perfect. And it wasn't written,

166
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.600
I'm not sure if how that story ended, but for him,

167
00:09:24.601 --> 00:09:27.360
but Dave's version was fifth iteration was great.

168
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:31.410
And so he'd done that with everything you need in a browser.

169
00:09:31.411 --> 00:09:35.160
And this really showed well in Phoenix, what we called Phoenix,

170
00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:38.970
and it had to rename two more times. Um, and you know, uh,

171
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.750
Blake went to Stanford, he became a Stanford student and couldn't work on it.

172
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:46.350
Um, Dave Hyatt went to Apple in 2001.

173
00:09:46.351 --> 00:09:48.900
He was one of the founding Safari team members. Um.

174
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.810
<v 3>Interesting. But he was still blogging.</v>

175
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.850
<v 1>About tabbed browsing. I think Apple, at some point said, sorry,</v>

176
00:09:54.851 --> 00:09:58.170
I have to have browsing. Yeah. But it was because of Hyatt high.

177
00:09:58.171 --> 00:10:01.140
It was quite a feather in their cap that Don Melton at, uh,

178
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.260
who had been the engineering manager at, at, at, for Safari, from the beginning,

179
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.960
uh, had been in that scape also. And so this is the, a spore of talent and,

180
00:10:08.961 --> 00:10:12.210
and yet high, it was still kind of writing blog posts about how to do tabs,

181
00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:15.090
right. And at some point Apple said, don't, don't blog about that.

182
00:10:15.091 --> 00:10:18.360
That's our proprietary tab technology. And it's like, no, it's not,

183
00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:20.370
it was an opera and I've refined it. Um,

184
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.990
so we had to replace people and we had Ben Goodyear, uh,

185
00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:27.090
New Zealand.

186
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:30.780
We hired it in this game and he stepped in to be the F Firefox lead.

187
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:36.180
And we also had this weird circumstance where AOL finally did notice that

188
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:40.230
Netscape was kind of a albatross that they bought it for no particular benefit.

189
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:45.090
And even then the AOL politics were also heinous sort of East coast politics.

190
00:10:45.091 --> 00:10:47.580
I remember taking two trips there cause I was the principal engineer.

191
00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:51.060
And so I was principal engineers got trotted out to do dog and pony shows in

192
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.160
Dulles, Virginia. And the, uh,

193
00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.160
the upper management was very East coast and flavor.

194
00:10:56.161 --> 00:11:00.120
And they were at that time merging with time Warner not go well.

195
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:02.850
So one of these years we went out there and we were all doing dog and pony

196
00:11:02.851 --> 00:11:06.090
shows. And there were these characters that were sort of like marketing guys,

197
00:11:06.091 --> 00:11:09.570
one of the most wearing a crevasse and their mom was named Reggie and they were,

198
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:12.150
they were, they were very, um,

199
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.860
you rather than non you, or they were like, what's, what's,

200
00:11:16.861 --> 00:11:21.780
Stillman's metropolitan film. UHV um, urban Bush,

201
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:25.320
we, which was the, um, they were [inaudible], they, they were, um,

202
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:25.320
 funny and they were kind of useless and kind of preppy. And then the next year we went back and I said, where's Reggie. And it's like, Oh, 

203
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:25.320
Richie's not here anymore. Because

204
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:25.320
 time Warner realized that the merger wasn't in their interest either, and then the sort of knives came out and this was these, these mergers really work, right. 

205
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:25.320
It's, it's

206
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:25.320
 very difficult. You get these giant companies and they think there's going to be synergy. That was the nineties late nineties 

207
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:25.320
and watch ward

208
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:25.320
. And there wasn't synergy with AOL by Netscape. And there wasn't synergy with time Warner. 

209
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.153
Does it AOL.

210
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.010
<v 3>Ever really work? Was it ever really cool.</v>

211
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:58.690
<v 4>Like the same kind of fire and excitement that Firefox eventually created was</v>

212
00:11:58.691 --> 00:12:00.040
that ever there and AOL.

213
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:05.820
<v 1>AOL was the right time to do a dial up service that got distribution</v>

214
00:12:05.821 --> 00:12:10.020
by basically leaflet, bombing, compact discs, right on the country.

215
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:14.850
And they beat out CompuServe and the other ones prodigy,

216
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:19.080
and then the web happened. And so you had almost like this, um,

217
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.490
isolated continent, like some of the evolutionary biologist, I follow them,

218
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:27.510
make fun of the, the, the funny large mammals, you know, uh,

219
00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:31.230
marsupial mammals of, of Australia, how, how silly they are.

220
00:12:31.231 --> 00:12:33.930
And so AOL is like Australia and,

221
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:37.530
and you saw it over time because they kept aging and they were using AOL to get

222
00:12:37.531 --> 00:12:41.500
online. And they couldn't really use a web browser. And it became sort of a,

223
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:43.140
a valued cohort.

224
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.350
Cause they're still have relatively high socioeconomic status and they have

225
00:12:46.351 --> 00:12:49.170
grandchildren, but it's going away. It's dying at some point.

226
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:53.610
<v 4>The end of the arts that decade, and then to the decade, uh,</v>

227
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.260
2010, plus that Firefox became this incredible.

228
00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:01.500
I feel I'm Chrome came out, but I made September, 2008,

229
00:13:01.501 --> 00:13:04.500
but Firefox was the sexy, cool thing.

230
00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:07.770
That's represented a lot of the cutting edge technologies and all that kind of

231
00:13:07.771 --> 00:13:08.604
stuff.

232
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.470
<v 1>To it. It was amazing people rally.</v>

233
00:13:10.471 --> 00:13:13.140
And John Battelle did the first web two conference,

234
00:13:13.141 --> 00:13:16.410
which eventually became huge and they split it. But that was in 2004.

235
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:19.980
It was right when Firefox was out, Craigslist was, it was a huge,

236
00:13:19.981 --> 00:13:23.070
it was killing classified revenue for newspapers. But, um,

237
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:26.820
there was just this ferment people starting pedia along their email,

238
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:29.370
it was already done. And it was an impressive web mail.

239
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.900
There were others before like Hotmail,

240
00:13:30.901 --> 00:13:33.630
but Gmail is really impressive from Google and Google maps.

241
00:13:33.631 --> 00:13:36.150
People started seeing what could be done. They thought,

242
00:13:36.151 --> 00:13:39.450
how can you drag the map around? And you know, how does that work?

243
00:13:39.451 --> 00:13:41.820
And it was all JavaScript and images and, and, um.

244
00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.950
<v 4>Gmail was 2003, four.</v>

245
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:47.100
<v 1>I actually started quite early. It might've been 2002 or three,</v>

246
00:13:47.101 --> 00:13:50.550
but by the time we started dealing with Google with Firefox to get the search

247
00:13:50.551 --> 00:13:54.180
deal, which was the main revenue source from Azula and still is, um,

248
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:59.430
2004 early Sergei. Brin's, uh, one of his trusted engineer guys,

249
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.510
Fred Schneider made contact with me and Mazola and we started talking and we

250
00:14:03.511 --> 00:14:08.010
realized, um, search and browser need each other. And this is deeply true,

251
00:14:08.011 --> 00:14:09.180
right? This is still true.

252
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:11.790
This is why a lot of the search engines have their own browsers.

253
00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:13.570
<v 4>Yeah. So in case people don't know the,</v>

254
00:14:13.571 --> 00:14:17.010
the main revenue source for the browser is the default search engine,

255
00:14:17.011 --> 00:14:20.170
which is kind of incredible to think about that, uh, that,

256
00:14:20.171 --> 00:14:22.290
that is a revenue source. It's a little bit sad.

257
00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:22.590
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

258
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:26.160
It leads to this capture or kill effect where you have the search engine own its

259
00:14:26.161 --> 00:14:31.020
own browser. And other browsers may struggle to get distribution.

260
00:14:31.021 --> 00:14:31.890
We talked about earlier.

261
00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:37.170
<v 4>So where, and you said, uh, you've figured out that, uh,</v>

262
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:41.100
Google is working on its own browser at some point that I'm six, 2006.

263
00:14:41.101 --> 00:14:45.450
So would you say Firefox versus was internet Explorer part of the war here or

264
00:14:45.451 --> 00:14:46.920
was the Firefox versus Chrome?

265
00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:50.280
<v 1>So Firefox didn't quite cause Microsoft to reconvene.</v>

266
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:52.070
I E they did do [inaudible]

267
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.070
. And I remember being on a plane back from the standards meeting Josh senators

268
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.070
, meeting

269
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.070
 from Seattle, from Redmond. And there was some Microsoft guy in front of me. It turns out my wife knew him from her past life before we married. And he was just this bearded big guy. And he was like, 

270
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.070
well, you should have

271
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.070
 just killed Firefox in the cradle. All we needed to do was add public blocking 

272
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.070
in and tabs. And we could have made an internet kill

273
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.070
 Firefox. And it's like, shoulda, coulda, woulda pal. And I was already behind them 

274
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.070
hearing that. Um,

275
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.070
 but they didn't, they were slow and they ice seven. Wasn't that great. And what

276
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.070
 really got them started, I think was, um,

277
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.070
 Chrome. And, you know, I talked to Larry Page in 2005, I think I said, you know, we're talking about the Firefox relationship, but he was also saying, what 

278
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.903
about WebKit?

279
00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:40.550
This was Apple's version of the old cage email engine from,

280
00:15:40.551 --> 00:15:43.550
from Linux, the KT East side of Linux. Um,

281
00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:48.230
those used in the conqueror browser also with case that Apple had forked and,

282
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:52.820
and in 2005 was when Apple's principles, including Dave Hyatt, Manchester,

283
00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:56.330
Coby X, some of my friends who were still there said, we, we must stop patch,

284
00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:58.310
bombing this poor Katie KML project.

285
00:15:58.311 --> 00:16:01.460
We should make a proper Muslim like organization webkit.org.

286
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:04.220
Now it wasn't a separate nonprofit or anything. It was still Apple,

287
00:16:04.221 --> 00:16:05.000
it was Apple controlled,

288
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.770
but they made their fork first-class and they made it be something that they all

289
00:16:09.771 --> 00:16:12.410
worked in and lived in. And that was before Chrome.

290
00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:16.280
And then Chrome Larry Page said, what about web? Can I say, yeah, it's nice.

291
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:19.340
I have friends who work on it. You might use that. If you do your own browser,

292
00:16:19.341 --> 00:16:21.320
why don't you do your own browser? Don't worry about Firefox.

293
00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:22.670
You should do your own browser.

294
00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:26.780
You can have your own opinion of how it should work and sure enough, they did.

295
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:29.270
So by 2006, we knew they'd been working on it. Some of the,

296
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.960
some of my friends who'd been at Netscape did the original demo and the demo,

297
00:16:32.961 --> 00:16:34.220
wasn't what you thought it didn't have.

298
00:16:34.221 --> 00:16:38.990
The fast JavaScript you had that was still often Denmark in the farm, um,

299
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.790
did have tabs. It had tabs because all browsers had tabs disappoint and it had,

300
00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:46.850
uh, this software fault isolation.

301
00:16:46.851 --> 00:16:50.900
They mentioned it was through process isolation. So in theory,

302
00:16:50.901 --> 00:16:53.300
each tab has its own operating system process.

303
00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.700
And so the what's going to take your tab down. Well,

304
00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:59.420
web kit has bugs that can crash it, but flash was still big.

305
00:16:59.421 --> 00:17:02.660
Then all the restaurant sites remember and flash crashed a lot.

306
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:06.770
So the demo that I heard about my friends ex Netscape X there's,

307
00:17:06.771 --> 00:17:10.220
a lot of people did inside Google was the sad tab.

308
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:11.870
They showed an early version of Chrome,

309
00:17:11.871 --> 00:17:13.700
which is just this bare bones tab browser.

310
00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:18.260
They loaded the site with a known flash phone and that suddenly flash crashes,

311
00:17:18.261 --> 00:17:20.150
and everyone expected the whole browser to go down.

312
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:22.550
But instead you got this little sad face in the tab,

313
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:25.940
and then you could reload it. And there it is again. So this was, this was, uh,

314
00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.040
an improvement. It was a real move for security.

315
00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:32.990
It was based on a company they acquired called green border that had some really

316
00:17:32.991 --> 00:17:35.620
big brains like old fart Ellingson, I think was involved in,

317
00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.630
they had done some exotic, uh, security stuff,

318
00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:42.860
but they ended up simplifying it to this process isolation. And, um,

319
00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:46.490
it was good and Firefox didn't have it at the time.

320
00:17:46.491 --> 00:17:50.190
So we were still struggling with, you know, uh, security, bugs. Um,

321
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:54.240
so we knew Chrome was coming, but it took two more years to come out.

322
00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:57.030
And at the time we were still getting, you know,

323
00:17:57.031 --> 00:17:59.190
the Google search revenue and we were still, um,

324
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.780
making Google the default engine and Firefox was still growing and Firefox grew,

325
00:18:03.781 --> 00:18:08.400
I think until 2011, that was when it peaked. And as it started falling,

326
00:18:08.401 --> 00:18:10.950
it was because of Chrome, Chrome hanging out in 2008.

327
00:18:10.951 --> 00:18:14.550
And it was a comic book that leaked accidentally that showed some of the people

328
00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.590
who worked on it, Lars Bach was in there. And so on,

329
00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:20.100
it was kind of soft launch because they didn't market it heavily.

330
00:18:20.101 --> 00:18:21.660
They didn't push distribution,

331
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:26.220
but Google had reason to worry about distribution because Microsoft was,

332
00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:30.540
you know, doing a search engine beings since 2007. In fact,

333
00:18:30.541 --> 00:18:31.680
when they came out with Bing,

334
00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:36.270
Google was worried that Microsoft would just brute force switch the default

335
00:18:36.271 --> 00:18:41.160
browser and everyone's internet Explorer or Firefox on windows to being

336
00:18:41.161 --> 00:18:44.310
from Google and, uh, Microsoft wasn't I think,

337
00:18:44.311 --> 00:18:48.210
ready to dare the antitrust cops that way, even though they'd gone to sleep.

338
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:51.030
And, uh, I don't think thing was ready either,

339
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:56.640
but just in case it happens Sundar Pichai who Rose very well based on

340
00:18:56.641 --> 00:19:00.360
this work was sort of, uh, in charge of getting distribution deals.

341
00:19:00.361 --> 00:19:05.280
And he got Google toolbar and Google desktop search distribution.

342
00:19:05.281 --> 00:19:09.240
And remember those pieces of software, those were like desktop, uh, extensions,

343
00:19:09.241 --> 00:19:10.074
toolbars,

344
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.290
or operating system extensions for doing desktop search search and your local

345
00:19:13.291 --> 00:19:17.610
files kind of like a spotlight, right? Sadly die of doubt. They all died.

346
00:19:17.611 --> 00:19:19.650
And there were some features that we still missed that didn't make it into

347
00:19:19.651 --> 00:19:23.340
Chrome, but Sunday got OEMs to bundle those.

348
00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:28.080
And then he got enough of those deals that by 2007 or eight, Google felt well,

349
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:31.290
if being Microsoft does the worst and tries to force Bing,

350
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:36.000
we can reach in and reset it with that point of presence. So that was, you know,

351
00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:37.890
good for Sundar his career. And it was good for Google,

352
00:19:37.891 --> 00:19:41.580
but it never came to pass that they had to defend. Microsoft was still,

353
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.730
you know, slow. And by the time they saw Chrome come out,

354
00:19:44.731 --> 00:19:47.790
then they did what would have been INI. And then they said,

355
00:19:47.791 --> 00:19:51.990
we're going to have a fast JavaScript engine to chakra chopper core. And, um,

356
00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.870
they get, okay. They were another process,

357
00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:58.110
isolated fast JavaScript browser tab browser.

358
00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.260
<v 4>So it sounds like there's a deep,</v>

359
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:03.410
fundamental coupling of search engine and browser.

360
00:20:03.411 --> 00:20:07.760
That's mixing this whole thing up and obviously Firefox doesn't have, uh,

361
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:11.470
a search engine. That's like, I mean, you're, you're,

362
00:20:11.471 --> 00:20:14.960
you're partnering with one with somebody with a search engine. Yeah. With,

363
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:18.380
with Yahoo or with, uh, uh, with Google or something.

364
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:22.010
<v 1>They tried Yahoo. That was unfortunately, because I think, um,</v>

365
00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.200
even though Marissa Mayer talked about it,

366
00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:27.350
she never pulled it off and never restored the search, uh,

367
00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:31.210
team that had been laid off. I believe Carol Bartz was running Yahoo.

368
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.280
And Carol said, I've got to get rid of one of three expensive things.

369
00:20:34.281 --> 00:20:36.410
I'm going to get rid of search. And, um,

370
00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.500
those researchers went to Google and Microsoft,

371
00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:42.230
and there was no way to put Yahoo search back together.

372
00:20:42.231 --> 00:20:45.770
So when Firefox tried switching all their users,

373
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:50.320
who'd stuck with a default from, to Yahoo, like mid December, 2014.

374
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:55.030
That's what just happened to my firebox. And others didn't notice right away,

375
00:20:55.031 --> 00:20:57.490
but over time they did. And so over the next year,

376
00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:01.440
the traffic just went away for Yahoo and,

377
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:05.590
and yet they were obliged. I understand it. I, I don't have inside knowledge,

378
00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.080
but this is leaked out. And Danny Sullivan's written about it.

379
00:21:08.081 --> 00:21:11.230
Search engine land. I think the deal was like fixed payments to Mozilla.

380
00:21:11.231 --> 00:21:14.320
So Mozilla was getting a bunch of money for traffic that wasn't staying because

381
00:21:14.321 --> 00:21:18.400
users were resetting their default and this shows how defaults are important,

382
00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.700
but they have to be good enough that the user doesn't override them.

383
00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:23.230
And you know,

384
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:27.820
a lot of the commercial value in popular apps is one of the default settings.

385
00:21:27.821 --> 00:21:29.080
What is the default search?

386
00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.950
<v 5>But oftentimes there's sometimes just like you said, I mean,</v>

387
00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:34.350
if there's something compelling,

388
00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:38.730
that's also can beat out the default like tab browsing and so on. Yes.
