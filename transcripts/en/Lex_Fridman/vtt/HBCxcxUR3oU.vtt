00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.530
<v 0>For you individually though,</v>

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.820
does it make you sad that your brain ends,

3
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.280
that you die one day very soon

4
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.520
that the whole thing that, that, that, uh, that data source just goes offline

5
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.520
sooner than you did. Like.

6
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.050
<v 1>That's a complicated question.</v>

7
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.670
I would have answered it differently in different times in my life.

8
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.320
I had chronic depression for 10 years. And so in that 10 year, time period,

9
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.620
I desperately wanted lights to be off.

10
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.600
And the thing that made it even worse is I was in a religious,

11
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.800
I was born into a religion. It was the only reality I ever understood.

12
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.790
And it's difficult to articulate to people when you're born into that kind of

13
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:51.241
reality.

14
00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:55.920
And it's the only reality you've exposed to you are literally blinded to the

15
00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:59.910
existence of other realities, because it's so much the ingroup outgroup thing.

16
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.730
And so in that situation,

17
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.580
it was not only that I desperately wanted lights out forever.

18
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.930
It was that I couldn't have lights out from it.

19
00:01:07.931 --> 00:01:12.780
It was that there was an afterlife and this afterlife had this

20
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.310
system that would either penalize or, or, uh,

21
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.300
reward you for your behaviors. And so it was almost like this

22
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.780
is indescribable hopelessness of not only

23
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.230
being in hopeless despair of not wanting to exist,

24
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.600
but then also being forced to be to exist.

25
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.800
And so there was a duration of my time of alteration of life where I'd say like,

26
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:38.220
yes,

27
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.840
I have no remorse for lights being out and actually

28
00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:45.300
want it more than anything in the entire world.

29
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.020
There are other times where I'm looking out at the future and I say,

30
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.420
this is an opportunity for future evolving human conscious

31
00:01:56.421 --> 00:02:00.560
experience. That is beyond my ability, understand it.

32
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.440
And I jumped out of bed and I raced to work.

33
00:02:03.441 --> 00:02:06.920
And I can't think about anything else, but I,

34
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.960
I think the, the reality for me is,

35
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.650
I don't know what it's like to be in your head, but in my head,

36
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.930
when I wake up in the morning, I don't say good morning, Brian,

37
00:02:20.931 --> 00:02:22.100
I'm so happy to see you. Like,

38
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.980
I'm sure you're just going to be beautiful to me today.

39
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.560
You're not going to make a huge long list of everything you should be anxious

40
00:02:27.561 --> 00:02:30.290
about. You're not going to repeat that list to me 400 times.

41
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.410
You're not going to have me re relive all the regrets I've made in life.

42
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.060
I'm sure you're not doing any of that.

43
00:02:35.061 --> 00:02:38.090
And you're just going to just help me along all day long. I mean,

44
00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:42.470
it's a brutal environment in my brain and we've just become

45
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.280
normalized to this environment that we just accept that this is what it means to

46
00:02:46.281 --> 00:02:49.100
be human. But if we look at it,

47
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.200
if we try to muster as much soberness as we can about the realities of being

48
00:02:54.201 --> 00:02:57.260
human, it's brutal if it is for me.

49
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.200
And so am I sad that the brain may be

50
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:05.890
off one day? Hmm.

51
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.480
It depends on the contextual setting. Like,

52
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:09.930
how am I feeling at what moment are you asking me that? And that's,

53
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.280
it's my mind is so fickle and this is why, again,

54
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:16.740
I don't trust my conscious mind. I have been given realities. I gave,

55
00:03:16.741 --> 00:03:20.470
I was given a religious reality. That was a video game.

56
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.590
And then I figured out it was not a real reality.

57
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:25.330
And then I lived in a depressive reality,

58
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:29.830
which delivered this terrible hopelessness. That wasn't a real reality.

59
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.230
Then I discovered a behavioral psychology,

60
00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:36.670
and I figured out how bias 188 critical biases and how my brain is distorting

61
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:40.300
reality. At the time I have gone from one reality to another,

62
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.350
I don't trust reality. I don't trust realities that are given to me.

63
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.760
And so to make,

64
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.510
try to make a decision on what I value or not value of that future state.

65
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.920
I don't trust my response.

66
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.260
<v 0>So not fully,</v>

67
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.080
not fully listening to the conscious mind at any one moment as the

68
00:03:59.081 --> 00:04:03.290
ultimate truth, but allowing you to go up and down as it does and just kind of.

69
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.570
<v 1>Observing it. Yes.</v>

70
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:09.370
I assume that whatever my conscious mind delivers up to my awareness is

71
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:14.110
wrong on pawn landing. And I just need to figure out where it's wrong,

72
00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:17.860
how what's wrong, how wrong it is, and then try to correct for it as best I can.

73
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.640
But I, I assume that on impact it's,

74
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.740
it's mistaken in some critical ways.

75
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.290
<v 0>Is there something you can say by way of advice when the mind is</v>

76
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:33.040
depressive, when the conscious mind serves up something that a,

77
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.900
you know, dark thoughts, how you deal with that,

78
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.180
my calling your own life you've overcome that.

79
00:04:40.181 --> 00:04:43.390
And others who are experienced in that, uh, can overcome it.

80
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.180
<v 1>Two things. One that those depressive</v>

81
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.010
states are biochemical states.

82
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.530
It's not you.

83
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.410
And the suggestions that these things that this state delivers to you about

84
00:05:02.411 --> 00:05:07.000
suggestion of the hopelessness of Lysol or the meaninglessness of it, or

85
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.910
that you should hit the eject button. That's a false reality.

86
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.020
Yeah.

87
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.520
And that it's when I completely

88
00:05:18.521 --> 00:05:21.760
understand the rational decision to commit suicide,

89
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.600
there's it is not lost on me at all, but that is,

90
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.410
that is an international situation.

91
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:31.120
But the key is when you're in that situation of those thoughts are landing to be

92
00:05:31.121 --> 00:05:33.790
able to say, thank you. You're not real.

93
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.800
I know you're not real. Yeah. And so I'm in a situation where,

94
00:05:38.801 --> 00:05:42.040
for whatever reason, I'm having this, this a neurochemical state,

95
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.420
but that state can be altered. And so it, again,

96
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.810
it goes back to the realities of, of the difficulties of, of being human.

97
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.000
And like, when I was trying to solve my depression,

98
00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:54.940
I tried literally F you name it.

99
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.400
I tried it systematically and nothing would fix it.

100
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.150
And so this is what gives me hope with brain interfaces, for example, like,

101
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.540
could I have numbers on my brain? Can I see what's going on?

102
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.600
Because I go to the doctor and it's like, how do you feel? I don't know,

103
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.010
terrible, like on a scale from one to 10, how bad you want to commit suicide 10,

104
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.720
like.

105
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.760
<v 0>Okay, at this moment, here's this, here's this.</v>

106
00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.340
<v 1>Bottle. How much should I take? Well, I don't know. Like just.</v>

107
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.040
<v 0>Yeah, it's very, very crude. And as data opens up the, the,</v>

108
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.960
yeah,

109
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.770
it opens up the possibility of really helping in those dark moments to

110
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.520
first understand the ways the ups and downs of postdoc.

111
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.010
One was on the complete flip side of that. I,

112
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:45.080
I am a very conscious in my own brain and deeply,

113
00:06:45.081 --> 00:06:48.410
deeply grateful that what there it's,

114
00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:50.120
it's almost like a chemistry thing,

115
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.650
a biochemistry thing that I go many times throughout the day,

116
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:55.650
I'll,

117
00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.200
I'll look at like this cup and I'll be overcome with

118
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.790
joy, how amazing it is to be alive. Like, I actually think I'm,

119
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.750
my biochemistry is such that it's not as common.

120
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:14.300
Like I've talked to people and I don't think that's that common. Like it's,

121
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.080
and it's not a rational thing at all. It's like,

122
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.060
I feel like I'm on drugs and I'll just be like, whoa.

123
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.040
And a lot of people talk about like the meditative experience will allow you to

124
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:30.200
sort of, you know, look at some basic things,

125
00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:33.560
like the movement of your hand as a deeply joyful,

126
00:07:33.561 --> 00:07:37.070
because it's like that's life. But I get that from just looking at a cup,

127
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.040
like I'm waiting for the coffee to brew and I'll just be like.

128
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.100
Life is awesome. And I'll sometimes tweet that, but then I'll like,

129
00:07:46.101 --> 00:07:50.960
regret it later. Like, God it. You so a ridiculous. But yeah. So,

130
00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:55.790
but that is purely chemistry. I there's no rational.

131
00:07:55.791 --> 00:07:57.680
It doesn't fit with the rest of my life. I have all this.

132
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.730
I'm always late to stuff. I'm always like, there's all stuff, you know,

133
00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:06.230
I'm super, self-critical like really self-critical about everything. I do. I,

134
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.570
to the point, I almost hate everything I do,

135
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.410
but there's this engine of joy for life outside of all that,

136
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.270
and that has to be chemistry.

137
00:08:14.271 --> 00:08:17.210
And the flip side of that is what depression probably is,

138
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:21.740
is the opposite of that feeling of like,

139
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:27.650
cause I, I bet you that feeling of the cup being amazing is would save

140
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.580
anybody in a state of depression. Like they, that will be like fresh.

141
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:35.810
You're in a desert and it's, it's a drink of water. Uh,

142
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.210
man, the brain is, uh,

143
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:44.000
it would be nice to understand where that's coming from to be able to, um,

144
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.460
to understand the, how,

145
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.910
how you hit those lows and those highs that have nothing to do with the actual

146
00:08:49.911 --> 00:08:54.650
reality it has to do with some very specific aspects, uh,

147
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.850
of, uh, how you maybe see the world.

148
00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.120
Maybe it could be just like basic habits you engage in.

149
00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:04.290
And then it's hard to walk along the line to, to find those experiences of joy.

150
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:09.510
<v 1>And this goes back to the discussion we're having of human cognition is in</v>

151
00:09:09.511 --> 00:09:13.770
volume, the largest input of raw material into society.

152
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.690
Yeah. And it's not quantified, we have no bearings on it.

153
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.440
And so we just, you wonder,

154
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.520
we both articulated some of the challenges we have in our own mind,

155
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:32.460
and it's likely that others would say I have something similar.

156
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:37.050
And you wonder when you look at society, what,

157
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.340
how does that contribute to all the other compounder problems that we're

158
00:09:41.341 --> 00:09:45.030
experiencing? How does that blind us to the,

159
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.840
all the opportunities we could be looking at? And so it really,

160
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:53.280
it has this potential distortion effect on

161
00:09:53.281 --> 00:09:56.130
reality. That just makes everything worse.

162
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:59.790
And I hope if we can put some, if we can

163
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.160
assign some numbers to these things, just to get our bearings.

164
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:07.110
So we're aware of what's going on.

165
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.860
If we could find greater stabilization in how we conduct our lives and how we

166
00:10:10.861 --> 00:10:15.170
build society, it,

167
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:19.530
it might be the thing that enables us to scaffold, uh,

168
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.720
because we've really, again, we've done it. Uh, uh,

169
00:10:21.721 --> 00:10:25.080
humans have done a fantastic job, systematically scaffolding,

170
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.060
technology and science and institutions. It's human.

171
00:10:30.061 --> 00:10:33.930
These are our own selves, which we have not been able to scaffold it's it's.

172
00:10:33.931 --> 00:10:34.410
We are the,

173
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:38.610
we are the one part of this intelligence infrastructure that remains unchanged.
