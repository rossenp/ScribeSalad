00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.100
<v 0>How unlikely do you think life is on earth?</v>

2
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.700
So when you look,

3
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.700
when you study other planets and you study the contents of other planets,

4
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.620
does that give you a perspective on, um, the origin of life on earth,

5
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.290
which again is full of mystery in itself, not the evolution, but the, or origin,

6
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.610
the first springing to life, like from, from nothing to life,

7
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.530
from the basic agrees to life. I,

8
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.050
I guess another way of asking it is how unique are we?

9
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.410
<v 1>Yeah, it's a great question. And it's one that just scientifically,</v>

10
00:00:41.411 --> 00:00:43.410
we don't have an answer to, we,

11
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.880
you don't even know how many times life evolved on earth,

12
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.720
if it was only once or if it happened independently,

13
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.440
a thousand times in different places, uh,

14
00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:56.720
we don't know whether it's happened anywhere else in the universe, although it,

15
00:00:56.721 --> 00:01:01.480
it feels absurd to believe that we are the only life that evolved in the

16
00:01:01.481 --> 00:01:03.360
entire universe, but it's conceivable.

17
00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:07.950
We just have just no real information.

18
00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:11.430
We don't understand really how life came about in the first place on earth.

19
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.150
<v 0>I mean, so if you look at the Drake equation that tries to estimate how many</v>

20
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.070
alien civilizations are out there,

21
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.390
planets have a big part to play in that equation.

22
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.340
If you were to bet money, uh, in terms of the odds of, uh,

23
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.420
origins of life on earth, I mean,

24
00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:35.180
this all has to do with how special and unique is earth.

25
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.620
What you land in terms of the number of civilizations has to do with how unique

26
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.780
the rare earth hypothesis is, how rare special is,

27
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.570
how rare and special is the solar system.

28
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.410
Like if you had to bet all your money on a,

29
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.090
on a completely unscientific question. Well, no,

30
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.810
actually it's actually a rigorously scientific.

31
00:01:55.811 --> 00:01:58.530
We just don't know a lot of things in that equation.

32
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.410
There's a lot of mysteries about that and it's slowly becoming better and better

33
00:02:03.411 --> 00:02:05.010
understood in terms of exoplanets,

34
00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:09.600
in terms of how many solar systems are out there, where there's planets,

35
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.160
there are Earthlike planets, that's getting better and better understood.

36
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.240
What's your sense from that perspective? Um,

37
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.040
how many alien civilizations out there? So zero or one plus.

38
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.120
<v 1>You're right. That the equation is, is being better. Understood,</v>

39
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.470
but you're really only talking about the first three parameters in the equation

40
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.870
or something. You know, how many stars are there? How many planets per star,

41
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.830
and then we are just barely scratching the surface of what fraction of those

42
00:02:35.831 --> 00:02:39.510
planets might be habitable. The rest of the terms in the equation are like,

43
00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:42.910
how likely is life to evolve, right. Given habitable conditions,

44
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.870
how likely is it to survive all these things? Um,

45
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.420
&lt;affirmative&gt; there are all these huge unknowns. Actually. I,

46
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.660
I remember when I first saw that equation, I think I was,

47
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.220
I think it was my first year of college and I thought, this is ridiculous.

48
00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.000
This is, &lt;laugh&gt; a common sense that didn't need to give, give a name, you know?

49
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.400
Um, and B just a bunch of unknowns.

50
00:03:05.401 --> 00:03:09.080
That's like putting our ignorance together in one equation, but I I've actually,

51
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.520
now I understand this equation, you know,

52
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.240
it's not something we ever necessarily have the answer to it's it just gives us

53
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.310
a framework for having the exact conversation we're having right now.

54
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.230
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and I think that's how it was intended in the first place,

55
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.230
when it was, was put into writing was to, to give people a language,

56
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.110
to communicate about the factors that go into the potential for aliens to

57
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.950
be out there and for us to find them, um, I,

58
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.470
I would put money on their being aliens.

59
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.900
I would not put money on

60
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.660
us having definitive evidence of them in my lifetime.

61
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.260
<v 0>Well, definitive is a funny, is a funny word. Cause uh,</v>

62
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.060
my sense is this is the saddest part for me is

63
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.180
my sense in terms of intelligent alien civilizations,

64
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.850
I feel like we're so we're so self-obsessed

65
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.130
that we literally would not be able to detect them even when they're like in

66
00:04:10.131 --> 00:04:13.490
front of us, like, like trees, cabals,

67
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.890
but just their intelligence could be, um,

68
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:22.920
realized on a scale on a time scale or physical scale that

69
00:04:22.921 --> 00:04:27.240
we're not appreciating. Like trees could be way more intelligent than us.

70
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.800
I don't know. It's just a dumb example. It could be rocks rock,

71
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.440
or it could be things like the, this, I love this.

72
00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:36.720
This is Dawkins memes.

73
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.480
It could be that ideas are the like ideas would have,

74
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.270
like where do ideas come from? Where do thoughts come from?

75
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.510
Maybe thoughts are the aliens or maybe thoughts is

76
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.390
the actual mechanisms of communication in, uh, physics, right?

77
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:54.250
It's just like,

78
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.150
we think of thoughts as something that Springs up from neurons firing where the

79
00:04:59.151 --> 00:05:03.460
hell they come from. And now what about consciousness?

80
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.980
Maybe consciousness is the communication. It sounds like ridiculous,

81
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.460
but like we're, so self-centered on this, uh, space,

82
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.340
time communication and physical space using like written language,

83
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.570
like spoken with audio &lt;laugh&gt; to on a time scale.

84
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:27.010
That's very specific on a physical scale. That's very specific. Uh, so,

85
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.170
so I, I tend to think that, uh, bacteria will probably recognize like,

86
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.450
like moving organisms will probably recognize,

87
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.050
but when that forms itself into intelligence,

88
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.410
most likely will be robots of some kind, cuz we won't be meeting the origins,

89
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.840
we'll be meeting the creations of those intelligence is we just would not be

90
00:05:45.841 --> 00:05:49.760
able to, uh, to appreciate it. And that's the saddest thing to me that, uh,

91
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.640
we, we, yeah, we we're too dumb.

92
00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.760
&lt;laugh&gt; the sea aliens, uh, like we're too, we kind of think like,

93
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.520
look at the progress of science,

94
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.840
we've accomplished so much the sad thing it could be that we're just like in the

95
00:06:06.841 --> 00:06:11.160
first 0.0, zero, zero 1% of understanding anything it's humbling. I.

96
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.080
<v 1>Hope that's true. Hope because I feel like we're very ignorant as a species.</v>

97
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.350
And I hope that our current level of knowledge only represents the 0.001% of

98
00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:25.310
what we will someday achieve. That actually feels optimistic to me. &lt;laugh&gt;.

99
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.630
<v 0>Well that I feel like that's easier for us to comprehend in the space of biology</v>

100
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.510
and not as easy to comprehend in the space of physics, for example,

101
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.140
because we have a sense that like we have, I, it like, if you,

102
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.060
if you talk to theoretical physicists,

103
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.020
they have a sense that we understand the basic laws that form

104
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.380
the nature of reality of our universe, but it,

105
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.940
so there's much more comp like physicists are much more confident.

106
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.140
&lt;laugh&gt; biologists are like, uh,

107
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.610
this is a squishy mess. We're doing our best, uh, physicists,

108
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.210
but I would be,

109
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.850
it'd be fascinating to see if physicists themselves would also be humble by

110
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.730
there being like, what the hell is dark matter and dark energy? What,

111
00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:16.170
what the hell is the, not just the origin of the, not just the big bang,

112
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.360
but all, everything that happened since the big bang,

113
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.760
a lot of things that happened since the big bang,

114
00:07:21.761 --> 00:07:25.040
we have no ideas about except basic models of physics. Right. Or what.

115
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.880
<v 1>Happened before the big bang? What, yeah.</v>

116
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.840
<v 0>Yeah. What happened before or what's happening inside the black hole?</v>

117
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.120
Why is there a black hole at the side of our galaxy?

118
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.480
Cause somebody answered this a super massive black hole.

119
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:39.710
Nobody knows how it started and they seem to be like in the mid of all galaxies.

120
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:45.230
Um, so that could be a portal for aliens to communicate through con okay. Um,

121
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.230
all right. Back to planets. &lt;laugh&gt; how, um,

122
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:52.790
what's your favorite outside of earth? What's your favorite planet or moon?

123
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:57.830
Maybe outside of the ones. Well first have we talked about it already or,

124
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:02.460
and then if we did mention it, what's the one outside of that. Oh gosh.

125
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.300
<v 1>I have to come up with another favorite. That's not IO. Oh.</v>

126
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.660
<v 0>IO is the favorite. Oh absolutely. Why is IO the favorite?</v>

127
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.020
<v 1>I mean basically everything I've, I've already said, it's just such a,</v>

128
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.860
an amazing and unique object. Um,

129
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.220
but on I guess a personal note,

130
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:23.810
probably the object that made me become a planetary scientist.

131
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.050
It's the first thing in the solar system that really deeply captured my

132
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:34.210
interest. Um, and when I started my PhD,

133
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:39.370
I wanted to be an astrophysicist working on things like galaxy evolution,

134
00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.280
um, and sort of slowly I had done some projects in the solar system,

135
00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:48.440
but IO was the thing that like really caught me into doing solar system science.

136
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:53.680
<v 0>Okay. Let's, let's leave, uh, moons aside. What's your favorite planet?</v>

137
00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.520
It sounds like you like moons better than planets. So it's.

138
00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:02.120
<v 1>Uh, that's accurate. Um, but the planets are, are fascinating. I think,</v>

139
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.360
you know, I find that the planets and the solar system really fascinating.

140
00:09:06.361 --> 00:09:11.320
What I like about the moons is that they there's so much less,

141
00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:14.440
that is known. There's still a lot more discoveries for,

142
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:18.270
and the questions that we can ask are, are still the, the bigger questions.

143
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:20.350
Gotcha. Um, which, you know, I,

144
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:24.670
and maybe I'm being unfair to the planets because we are still trying to

145
00:09:24.671 --> 00:09:28.630
understand things like was there ever life on Mars? And that is a huge question.

146
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.350
And one that we've sent numerous robots to Mars to try to answer.

147
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.460
So maybe I'm being unfair to the planet, but,

148
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.420
but there is certainly quite a bit more information, uh,

149
00:09:38.421 --> 00:09:42.660
that we have about the planets than the moons. But I mean, Venus is,

150
00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.020
is a fascinating object.

151
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.820
So I like the objects that lie at the extremes.

152
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:53.580
I think that if we can make a, a sort of theory or,

153
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.290
or like I've been saying framework for an are standing planets and moons that

154
00:09:57.291 --> 00:10:00.170
can incorporate even the most extreme ones, then, you know,

155
00:10:00.171 --> 00:10:03.930
those are the things that really test your theory and test your understanding.

156
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.130
And so they they've always really fascinated me,

157
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.490
not so much the nice habitable places like earth,

158
00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:12.690
but these extreme places like Venus that have, um,

159
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:19.800
sulfuric acid cloud and just incredibly hot and dense surfaces and Venus,

160
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.400
of course, I, I love volcanism for some reason. And,
