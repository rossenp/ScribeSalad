00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.100
<v 0>Do you think ultimately religion</v>

2
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.440
is good for human civilization?

3
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.320
Let me maybe phrase it differently is what's religion good

4
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:17.030
for.

5
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.160
<v 1>Okay. Yeah. That's a great question.</v>

6
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.590
Thanks for asking that most people don't ask that.

7
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.600
And I think it's the question to ask, why do we still have religion?

8
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.580
That's the question, right? Because scientists and others scholars,

9
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:33.050
um,

10
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.520
humanists even thought that there's this thing called the

11
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.830
secular secularization thesis. And it's this idea that the more, um,

12
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.480
we progress rationally and we have better instruments for understanding our

13
00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:51.710
reality, the less religious we will be, but that's been found to be untrue.

14
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.550
We're still very religious. Okay. So why, why is it around? Well,

15
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.650
it's adaptive in some way, in my opinion,

16
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.320
most many people would not agree with me,

17
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.860
but I kind of see it as an evolutionary adaptation.

18
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.450
Now think about religions. Okay. Think about Christianity again for one.

19
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.260
Um,

20
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.640
here comes this idea when you have this ruthless empire called the Roman empire,

21
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.950
which litters its its roads with crucified bodies to let

22
00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:23.090
you know don't mess with us. Okay. All right here.

23
00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:27.230
All of a sudden you have this guy saying God is love. Okay. All right.

24
00:01:27.231 --> 00:01:31.160
Well that's weird. Okay. So why, why does this take off? Well,

25
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:33.890
it takes off because we're becoming a, um,

26
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.110
a colonial power. That means we're going into other countries.

27
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.770
We're conquering them. We are, you know,

28
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.100
how do we survive together as,

29
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.370
as cultures that don't clash? Well,

30
00:01:49.371 --> 00:01:52.040
we have to have a belief structure that allows us to,

31
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.870
and I think religion function that way.

32
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.090
<v 0>So religions help us from also Richard</v>

33
00:01:59.091 --> 00:02:01.520
Dawkins me, my DIA.

34
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.300
It allows us to explore space of ideas. Um,

35
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.670
and that in itself is the, um,

36
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.010
so it's like evolution of ideas and which is a powerful tool for

37
00:02:13.011 --> 00:02:14.300
us to explore ideas.

38
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.620
<v 1>You know, if, if I believe that men have souls,</v>

39
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.100
do they? Yes, they do.

40
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:23.743
<v 0>Well.</v>

41
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.620
I'm trying to figure that out. Why still,

42
00:02:30.621 --> 00:02:34.970
in terms of souls do believe cats don't have souls, but we'll never,

43
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.810
we'll never, we'll never be able to confirm that.

44
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.720
<v 1>Maybe if we get better instruments, you know, the sole instrument,</v>

45
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.980
you need to come up with that one, please. Yeah. Not just for cats,

46
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.060
but for all animals and people in general, you can put them in like a little,

47
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.380
you know, sole machine and find out what's the status of their soul.

48
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.520
<v 0>That's funny. I hope will become a scientific of consciousness.</v>

49
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.740
<v 2>And consciousness is in some sense connected to maybe what the meaning</v>

50
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:07.480
of the word soul used to be.

51
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.320
And I think it's a fascinating open question. Like what is cautious and so on,

52
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.070
maybe we'll touch on, uh, in a little bit, but yeah. Anyway, back to her.

53
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.680
<v 1>Religions being adaptive, I think that Christianity probably helped us, um,</v>

54
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.950
become better people to each other.

55
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.250
As we moved into a more global society.
