WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.730
<v 0>Can we almost like as a case study,</v>

2
00:00:04.731 --> 00:00:08.370
look at a few people in the tech area that I'm familiar with. And I know, well.

3
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.990
<v 1>We can,</v>

4
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.530
the only caveat being that I may have no familiarization with them whatsoever,

5
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.650
and you may have to brief me on them.

6
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.850
<v 0>Yeah. So I'll do my best to brief the,</v>

7
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.930
I I'll do my best to reduce human beings into simple descriptions.

8
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.720
And then you can give me insights of why the hell they're such effective

9
00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:28.040
leaders, uh, based on my description,

10
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.800
not based on your actual deep knowledge of the human beings. &lt;laugh&gt; uh, so,

11
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.230
uh,

12
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.360
that caveat of my inability to speak both English language and describe humans.

13
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.240
Well, let's talk about first Elon Musk.

14
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.750
So he's known being quite harsh

15
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.270
in the sense of first of all, a very high bar of excellence

16
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.100
and, uh,

17
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.510
also willing to what he calls the kind of first principles thinking of asking

18
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.310
the, the questions that hurt, which is

19
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.300
why the hell are we doing it this way? Why can't it be done a lot better?

20
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.260
Not just better, but.

21
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.220
<v 1>A lot better. So, so let's,</v>

22
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.060
I don't wanna hear his whole character. I'll go one at one section at a time.

23
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:18.340
So we got a guy that's harsh. Yeah. And,

24
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.460
and asking the really hard questions. How can that be good? Or why is that good?

25
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.701
Well, first of all,

26
00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:28.010
it can be horrible &lt;affirmative&gt; and there's leaders out there that are harsh

27
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.650
and they're hated and no one likes them and no one wants to work for them and

28
00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:35.610
they never do anything. So what is it that Elon Musk does that makes,

29
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.970
gives him the ability to be harsh? So I was, I was, um,

30
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.010
hearing a description of me. Yeah.

31
00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:47.320
When I would give feedback to young seals

32
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.440
that had made mistakes during training operations.

33
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.040
And the description was that I same thing like this harsh

34
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.680
blunt force trauma,

35
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.760
and just totally direct

36
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.830
sledge hammer of truth that I would hit guys with.

37
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.700
But it's interesting because I always talk about, you know,

38
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.060
building relationships and making sure you're not offending someone. Yeah.

39
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.780
So how do these things match up? Well, I can tell you how they match up.

40
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.940
When I was being harsh,

41
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.180
the guys that I was being harsh with knew without one shred of doubt

42
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.210
that I cared about them or than anything else.

43
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.770
And that the reason I was giving them this feedback is because I wanted them to

44
00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:32.930
be able to lead their troops.

45
00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:34.930
I wanted them to be able to go accomplish their mission,

46
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.330
and I wanted them to be able to bring their guys home from war.

47
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.570
So I wasn't being harsh because it elevated my ego. I wasn't being harsh,

48
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.770
cuz I wanted to denigrate them. I was being actually being harsh because I,

49
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.080
them to accomplish the mission.

50
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.560
So if that's where Elon comes from, Hey, listen, we gotta make this happen.

51
00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.240
This is for, this is for the good of the world to do this. And people know that,

52
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.823
then it works.

53
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.720
<v 0>I'll bring this point back up with another guy, Steve Jo,</v>

54
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.160
but let me stay on Elon for a second. The, uh,

55
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.080
the other thing he does, which is interesting I'm I see the value of this.

56
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.230
It'd be great to hear you, uh, speak about it. Is I, unlike mania,

57
00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:23.830
the other CEOs, very rich billionaires, uh,

58
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.750
you know, involved in leaning. A lot of people, he

59
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.970
puts a lot of time into making sure he's on the factory floor.

60
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.050
He famously sleeps on the sort of like in the middle of things and

61
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.680
he puts a lot of effort.

62
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.720
He's also very good at it is being a low level engineer.

63
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.200
So like whatever the task is, he wants to understand the details.

64
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.360
And he'll talk to the lowest level person in terms of like, you know,

65
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.920
somebody who's, uh, like, uh, working,

66
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.080
literally I'm putting parts together.

67
00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.760
He wants to understand what the problem is, what the challenge,

68
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.550
if there's an emergency,

69
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.710
he wants to understand the actual details of the problem.

70
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.390
Not like delegating to a manager, but like cuz a lot of CEOs,

71
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.670
a lot of managers will, will, will talk about sort of the,

72
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.750
the power and the importance of delegation here.

73
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.110
He wants to know if there's a big problem. He wants to know the exact detail.

74
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.540
He wants to know the exact Zach problem. He wants to at the fundamental level,

75
00:04:23.541 --> 00:04:27.140
understand how to solve that problem. Uh, whether it has to do with materials,

76
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.380
whether it has to do with the actual manufacturing, the, uh,

77
00:04:30.381 --> 00:04:33.500
mechanical engineering aspect, like we're talking about like engineering,

78
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.340
this is a guy whos, a suit's a CEO tweets about Doish coin,

79
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.970
but like an actual job he's low level engineering.

80
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.450
And that to me was always inspiring to see somebody who knows

81
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.210
what the they're doing. That's what it like,

82
00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:56.330
he gains the respect of engineers at the lowest level.

83
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.120
I don't know if that's scalable, but that's always been inspiring to me.

84
00:05:02.121 --> 00:05:04.320
And I wonder how many people it's inspiring to.

85
00:05:04.321 --> 00:05:06.960
Maybe you could speak to the value of doing that of,

86
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.240
of EV no matter how high their level of leader is to be able to do the low

87
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.233
level.

88
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.080
<v 1>Yeah. And that's,</v>

89
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.240
that's a common trait that good leaders have and maybe he doesn't necessarily

90
00:05:19.241 --> 00:05:21.120
know how to do everything, a good leader,

91
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.430
but go down there and talk to the frontline troops and say, Hey, what,

92
00:05:25.431 --> 00:05:29.310
what is the issue that you're dealing with? Or you know, how can I support you?

93
00:05:29.311 --> 00:05:32.390
How can I give you help? And what one key point that you said is he said,

94
00:05:32.391 --> 00:05:35.070
when there's a problem, right. He gets in there.

95
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.910
So there's things happening at his companies that they're working.

96
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.390
And so he doesn't have to die. He, I'm not saying he never does,

97
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.180
but he doesn't have to spend as much time working on or,

98
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.660
or looking at some subsystem that's functioning. Well,

99
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.060
he's got a good leader in there. That's handling it.

100
00:05:52.061 --> 00:05:53.940
And he checks in with that leader and the leader says, yeah,

101
00:05:53.941 --> 00:05:57.360
it's working perfectly. He says, great. When there's a problem,

102
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.720
that's when he might have to get down there and dig into some details so that he

103
00:06:01.721 --> 00:06:03.560
fully understands it so that he,

104
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.440
when he digs down in the details and this is important,

105
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.640
he's coming from an altitude where he has a better, bigger perspective,

106
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.480
not necessarily better, but a bigger perspective.

107
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.150
So if you sit there and work on a problem,

108
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.870
whatever for eight hours and you're staring at, you know,

109
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:22.790
if you were planning a mission and you were,

110
00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.910
you were planning it for eight hours, you're staring at the,

111
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.270
the maps and the charts.

112
00:06:27.271 --> 00:06:29.110
And you're figuring out where all the troops are gonna be located.

113
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.350
And I come in after eight hours and I look at your plan from a,

114
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.230
from a distant perspective,

115
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.380
there's a good chance able to see holes in your plan that you couldn't see,

116
00:06:39.381 --> 00:06:42.540
cuz your perspective was too close. So,

117
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.460
so that's good for me to be able to come in from a higher perspective and have a

118
00:06:46.461 --> 00:06:47.280
look at it.

119
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.220
But also there's times where I need to get down there and actually

120
00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:54.940
look, you know, if you're looking at a problem, you say, look,

121
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.380
I can't figure out boss. I can't figure out how to get to this target.

122
00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.090
And I'm looking at it from a distance and I don't see,

123
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.370
I might need to start digging in and looking and saying, oh,

124
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.690
here's a route that we can take. That actually makes sense. Let's try that.

125
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:13.090
So I think it's a good example of someone going up and down

126
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.770
in altitude to look at problems,

127
00:07:14.771 --> 00:07:17.370
understanding what's happening with the frontline troops and at the same time

128
00:07:17.371 --> 00:07:21.640
being able to of go back to the strategic level. And I can, it,

129
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.200
it's probably this way.

130
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.440
The reason that he's successful is because he doesn't get stuck down there.

131
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:32.040
Yeah. Because if he felt the need to micromanage each and every part on a Tesla,

132
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.253
it wouldn't be,

133
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.040
it would be very unlikely that he would have the capacity to do all that.

134
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:43.510
Now he can hand over some broad chip design and say, Hey,

135
00:07:43.511 --> 00:07:44.670
this is what the function needs to be.

136
00:07:44.671 --> 00:07:47.270
And he gives it to Lex and Lex goes there with your team and you figured out and

137
00:07:47.271 --> 00:07:49.870
you make it happen. If he had to actually do that all himself,

138
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.510
most likely not possible. So that's what leaders should be doing.

139
00:07:54.511 --> 00:07:57.510
They should go elevate and, and, and,

140
00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.340
and then get down in the weeds when they to, and then go back up.

141
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.660
<v 0>The sad thing. This is the part that makes me not wanna do a startup</v>

142
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.500
is, uh, basically his whole life is dealing with emergencies.

143
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.100
Just like you said, he's not dealing,

144
00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:20.050
this is not shooting these about details of engineering is with

145
00:08:20.051 --> 00:08:23.410
like in the, in the case of the company life and death,

146
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.650
like something that can just completely damage the production line, right?

147
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:32.570
So he's constantly dealing with emergencies, putting out fires. And um,

148
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.570
I don't know if there's something to be said about that psychology, that,

149
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:36.843
of how, uh,

150
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:41.400
like he he's spoken himself that he's worried that his mind can hold up much

151
00:08:41.401 --> 00:08:41.940
longer.

152
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.240
<v 1>Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so hopefully in the near future, he,</v>

153
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.520
he will start to form more decentralized command where he has some subordinate

154
00:08:49.521 --> 00:08:54.520
leadership that he fully trusts and most important that he has properly trained

155
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.840
so that they can handle these day to day fires, at least 80% of them.

156
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.760
So only 20% of the time does he actually need to go in and solve a problem.

157
00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.680
If he's not doing that right now, then that's going to end up being a problem.

158
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.520
Anytime I, so I work with companies all the time and that's,

159
00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:15.310
what's interesting about this is I go and work with a CEO or with a,

160
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.710
with a C-suite of a company.

161
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.510
It takes a little while to figure out what's going on. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

162
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.990
I'm kind of going off of the things that you're telling me. Yeah.

163
00:09:21.991 --> 00:09:26.150
Almost anecdotally, right? Yes. But let's say that what you, and, and also,

164
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:27.590
I don't know how familiar you,

165
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:31.670
you actually are with the inner works of his companies. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

166
00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:36.540
But if we were to assume that what you're saying is accurate,

167
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.860
then my advice would be, Hey, listen,

168
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.500
you need to start putting a little bit more time and effort into training up

169
00:09:42.501 --> 00:09:45.100
some subordinate leadership that has the trust,

170
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:50.300
knowledge and expertise that you will be able to turn over. Some of these,

171
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:53.500
some of these details to, for two reasons, number one,

172
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.410
so you can let your brain, um, you, you can,

173
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.570
you can survive a little longer as he put it,

174
00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.490
but also all the time that you spend as a leader,

175
00:10:01.491 --> 00:10:05.090
looking down and into your organization is time that you're not looking up and

176
00:10:05.091 --> 00:10:06.930
out. So when you're not looking up and out,

177
00:10:06.931 --> 00:10:09.170
you're not seeing what the competitor's doing.

178
00:10:09.171 --> 00:10:12.170
You're not seeing where the market's going. There's problems. That, that,

179
00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:13.203
that can come from that.

180
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.090
So if right now he's spending too much time looking down and in,

181
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.760
and you mentioned, you know, you said, I don't know if I wanna do a startup,

182
00:10:18.761 --> 00:10:21.480
when you do a startup, you're gonna be looking down and in for a while. Yeah.

183
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:24.080
It's gonna take a while. You're gonna have to do all this work yourself.

184
00:10:24.081 --> 00:10:27.640
You're not gonna have the finances to put people manpower behind these things.

185
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:32.120
So that's probably, he, maybe he's in that mindset a little bit,

186
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.120
cuz he's done so many startups over the years.

187
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.750
And so he's in the he's habitually in the weeds.

188
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:40.670
So my advice would be all right,

189
00:10:40.671 --> 00:10:44.390
let's start looking at formulating some subordinate leadership that has the,

190
00:10:44.391 --> 00:10:46.790
like I said, the expertise, the trust that you can,

191
00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:51.910
you can start to turn over some of these more minute details to

192
00:10:51.911 --> 00:10:54.110
them so that you can start looking up and out. Yeah.

193
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:58.380
<v 0>I think he's done that more successful, uh, in someplace than others SpaceX.</v>

194
00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:01.300
A lot of people give, uh, um,

195
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.460
the credit Towe Shotwell for the CEO, um,

196
00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:10.460
the COO of SpaceX as, as a very successful person that runs.

197
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.340
But in Tesla, not as much.

198
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:18.410
So I wonder if you can comment on something, a lot of people worry about,

199
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.490
and this applies to a lot of tech companies,

200
00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:25.290
which is a lot of people worry about that.

201
00:11:25.291 --> 00:11:28.410
If Elon disappears the, the,

202
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:32.370
the innovative spirit, the company, as, as we know,

203
00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:36.890
'em today will collapse will stagnate and will basically

204
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.320
fail to do what they've been doing for so many years successfully.

205
00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.680
Is there some aspect to, uh,

206
00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:46.320
what makes a good leader that if you disappear,

207
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:52.370
it's still the thing still lives on and not just lives on, but thrives.

208
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:53.400
Yeah. So.

209
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.280
<v 1>What we have to do in those situations is we have to establish a strong culture</v>

210
00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:02.320
inside that organization. And if you are there, there's, there's,

211
00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:03.800
there's reasons why this happens, right?

212
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:09.760
If I have a big ego and I form a company and I love the fact that everyone looks

213
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:10.640
at me and says, oh,

214
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.030
Jocko made this company and he's is the creative force behind this company.

215
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.230
And that fuels my ego and it makes me feel good. And uh, you know,

216
00:12:17.231 --> 00:12:20.750
I'm working with you L and every time you come up with an idea, I say,

217
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.670
L you know, you need to stay in your box. Yeah. Right.

218
00:12:23.671 --> 00:12:28.150
So I'm not creating a culture that rewards that sort of

219
00:12:28.151 --> 00:12:30.750
creativity. And eventually when I die,

220
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:36.580
I won't have a educated my team on how to maintain

221
00:12:36.581 --> 00:12:38.780
that creative aspect. So again,

222
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:43.140
hopefully inside that organization, he's,

223
00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:48.380
he's encouraging and growing that culture where creativity is

224
00:12:48.381 --> 00:12:52.300
rewarded, where, where it flourishes, even when he's gone,

225
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.970
that's where we have to hope for.

226
00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.730
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. He, he, he is.</v>

227
00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:02.010
But I also seem to notice that there's not many people like him,

228
00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:07.770
people become complacent too

229
00:13:07.771 --> 00:13:11.850
easily at disappoint. I've been disappointed by people a little bit.

230
00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:17.000
It's like success makes people soft. Uh, with Elon,

231
00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:21.400
it seems like success doesn't have any effect. &lt;laugh&gt;,

232
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.600
it's like the reverse effect. It doesn't, it's like, what's the,

233
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:28.120
it's always like, what's the next bigger thing. Right.

234
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:30.560
He's living that exponential growth,

235
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:34.480
which I think that's the problem that you have to have some,

236
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:38.870
somebody who's constantly trying to find the 10 X solution,

237
00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:43.590
like trying to constantly improve things. And, uh, restlessly that,

238
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:46.710
I mean, that probably has to do with finding the right people,

239
00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:47.910
not just creating the culture,

240
00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.430
but creating the culture with the right set of people.
