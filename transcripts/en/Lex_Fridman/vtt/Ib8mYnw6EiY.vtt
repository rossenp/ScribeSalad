00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.770
<v 0>What is the correct or the respectful way to pronounce</v>

2
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.170
Afghanistan of Afghanistan? I,

3
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.370
I ran Iran. So as a Russian speaker of Stan.

4
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.570
Yeah, the on versus the Anne. Yeah. Is it, uh,

5
00:00:22.571 --> 00:00:26.280
different con true by country as an English speaker in America? Yeah.

6
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.320
Is it pretentious and disrespectful to say Afghanistan or is it

7
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.800
the opposite respectful to say it that way? What,

8
00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:34.760
what are your thoughts on that? That's.

9
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.520
<v 1>A fascinating question. Um, I defer to the people from those countries to,</v>

10
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.840
before sort out those politics. I think, you know,

11
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:43.950
I think one of the fascinating things about this,

12
00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:46.510
the region broadly is that it is a place of so many cultures and,

13
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.310
and really quite cosmopolitan.

14
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.150
So I think people are mostly quite forgiving about how you say Afghanistan,

15
00:00:53.151 --> 00:00:54.350
Afghanistan. It's not like Paris.

16
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.750
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; yeah, yeah. Right, right. The French are not forgiving.</v>

17
00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.030
<v 1>No, no, no. Yeah, exactly. No. I think people are very,</v>

18
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.790
very forgiving and I think that, you know, Iranians are a bit, you know,

19
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.420
more instructive in suggesting Iran rather than Iran. Right.

20
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.860
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I Iraq, Iraq, you know, I, I, I think there's, there's,

21
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.020
there's come to be a fit between certain ways of P in these places and

22
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.980
the position that Americans take about them. Right.

23
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.540
So it's more jarring when people say Iraq

24
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.410
and it comes with, you know, a claim that a certain kind of person, you know,

25
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.210
should be the victim of violence or, yeah. So.

26
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.610
<v 0>Does that, yeah, it's kind of like, uh,</v>

27
00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:38.370
talking about the democratic party or the democratic party it's says sometimes

28
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.770
using certain kind of terminology to make a little bit of a

29
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.560
sort of, uh, implied statement about your beliefs. That's fascinating.

30
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.040
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, I think when I hear Iraq and Iran, I mean, I think it, yeah.</v>

31
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:56.600
Is it intentional in the case of Democrat or is it just a, you know,

32
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.520
and whatever, I think again,

33
00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.640
I think most Iranians and Afghans people I know have,

34
00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:04.440
have been very cool about that. What annoys Afghans. Now I can say,

35
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:05.240
I think it's fair to say. I,

36
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.790
I don't mean to speak for mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; means people tiger people,

37
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.550
but I can just share with our, our non Afghan friends, um,

38
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.990
the term Afghan E uh, is,

39
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.870
is a kind of term of offense because that's the name of the currency.

40
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.790
And so lots people ask, you know, why having, especially,

41
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.620
again, it's more addicted Americans because, you know,

42
00:02:26.621 --> 00:02:29.780
we've been so deeply involved in that country, obviously for the last 20 years.

43
00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:32.420
Right. So Afghans ask why after 20 years,

44
00:02:32.421 --> 00:02:34.660
are you still calling us the wrong name? What.

45
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.513
<v 0>Is the right name?</v>

46
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.580
<v 1>Somebody, they, they prefer Afghans, Afghans. Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.300
And AF and AF Afghan E is the name of the currency. And so I just.

48
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.180
<v 0>Dodged a book cause I was gonna say, that's cool. Yeah. I hear you.</v>

49
00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:46.180
That's really great to know.

50
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.250
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. And it's, and it's again, I think,</v>

51
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.690
but I would emphasize that people are quite open and, and you know, it's a,

52
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.570
it's a whole region of incredible diversity and,

53
00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.360
and respect for linguistic pluralism actually. So I think that, you know,

54
00:03:00.361 --> 00:03:03.040
but I also appreciate that during, in this context, um,

55
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.120
when there's a lot of pain, you know,

56
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.240
in the Afghan Dipa community in particular, you know,

57
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.080
being called the wrong name after 20 years when they already feel so betrayed at

58
00:03:13.081 --> 00:03:16.320
this moment, you know, just kind of, if one follows us on social media,

59
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.790
that is one kind of, um, hot wire.

60
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.551
<v 0>Right? Yeah.</v>

61
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:25.870
So the reason I ask about pronunciation is because yes,

62
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.590
it is true that there are certain things when mispronounced kind of reveal that

63
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.670
you don't care enough to pronounce correctly. Right.

64
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:36.110
You don't know enough to pronounce correctly. Right.

65
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.590
And you dismiss the culture and the people,

66
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.220
which I think that's right as per your writing is something that

67
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.580
if it's okay, I'll go with Afghanistan. Yeah. Just because I'm used to,

68
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.180
I say I Iraq, Iran, but I say Afghanistan. Yeah. Yeah. That's great.

69
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.980
Is as you do in your writing, uh,

70
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.220
Afghanistan suffers from much misunderstanding from the rest of the world.
