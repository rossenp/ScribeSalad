00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.820
<v 0>I tend to like the thought experiment of the organism,</v>

2
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.900
like humans, aren't the organisms. I like the notion of like, uh,

3
00:00:11.901 --> 00:00:16.300
Richard Dawkins and memes that ideas themselves are the

4
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.940
organisms like that are just using our minds to evolve.

5
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.670
So like,

6
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.530
we're just like me eat receptacles for ideas to breed

7
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.570
and multiply and so on. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and maybe those are the aliens.

8
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.763
Yeah.

9
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.450
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; so, uh, Jordan Peterson has lines says, you know,</v>

10
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.610
you think you have ideas, but ideas have you. Yeah. Right. Good line. Which,

11
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.490
and, and then we know about the phenomenal groups and,

12
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.920
and there's so many things that constrain us,

13
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.640
but I think you can examine all that and not be completely owned by the

14
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.200
ideas and completely sucked into groupthink.

15
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.680
And part of your responsibility as a,

16
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.720
as a human is to escape that kind of phenomena, which isn't, you know,

17
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.670
it's, you know, it's it, one of the creative tension things, again,

18
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.230
you're constructed by it,

19
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.430
but you can still observe it and you can think about it and you can make choices

20
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.350
about to some level how constrained you are by it.

21
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.230
And, you know, it's useful to do that.

22
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.570
And, but, but there at the same time,

23
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.880
and it could be by doing that, that, you know, the, the, the group in society,

24
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.280
you're, you're part of becomes collectively even more interesting.

25
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.200
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so, you know, so the outside observer will think, wow,

26
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.540
you know,

27
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.520
all these Alexas running around with all these really independent ideas have

28
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:43.920
created something even more interesting than mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and, uh,

29
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:48.550
aggregate. So, so I, so I don't know I'm,

30
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.270
those are lenses to look at the situation that give you some inspiration,

31
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.950
but I don't think they're constraints. Right. You know,
