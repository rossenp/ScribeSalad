00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.140
<v 0>Oh, robotics people. I love you so much. &lt;laugh&gt; this is the, I, I, I, I could,</v>

2
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.060
I could talk forever about this, but yes, there's a technology problem.

3
00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:15.180
Let's focus on that and we'll figure out the actual, uh, impact on society,

4
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.620
how it's actually going to be applied,

5
00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:20.340
how it's actually going to be integrated from a policy and from a human

6
00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:20.890
perspective,

7
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.090
from a business perspective later first let's solve the technology problem.

8
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.890
That's not how life works friends, but okay. I'm sorry.

9
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.890
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. So, so I mean, you, I mean, I'm sure, you know,</v>

10
00:00:29.891 --> 00:00:31.810
the division of labor in these companies, right.

11
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.090
They're sort of a business development side. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know,

12
00:00:34.091 --> 00:00:36.690
and then there's the engineering side, right. And the engineers are like,

13
00:00:36.691 --> 00:00:38.970
oh my God, what are these business development people? You know,

14
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.610
why are they involved? You know, they're like, um, in this process.

15
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.280
So I ended up sort of coming up with a,

16
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.040
a few different ideas that people seem to be batting around and then really

17
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.640
tried to zero in on a layman's understanding of the limitations. Right. And it,

18
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.880
it turns out that's really obvious and,

19
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.520
and quite simple highway driving's a lot simpler. Right. Um, so, you know, the,

20
00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:06.270
the plan is simplify the problem. Right. Um,

21
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.670
and focus on highways because city driving is, is so, um,

22
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.470
so much more complicated. So from that, I,

23
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.350
I came up with basically six scenarios. Actually,

24
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.270
I came up with five that the developers were talking about.

25
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.100
And then one that I thought was a good idea that I had read about, um,

26
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.860
I think in like 2013 or 2014,

27
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.740
which was actually something that the us military was looking at.

28
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.100
I actually first heard about the idea of, of this kind of automation,

29
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.620
at least in, in, um, in sketched out form in like 2011,

30
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.020
I guess it was with Peloton,

31
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.050
which was this sort of early technology entrance into the trucking

32
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.330
industry, which was working on platooning platooning trucks. And,

33
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.730
and all they were doing was, you know, a cooperative,

34
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.650
adaptive cruise control as they, they came to call it mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. Um,

35
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.570
and we ended up on a panel together and it's,

36
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.640
it's kind of interesting because I was on that panel because I was thinking

37
00:02:06.641 --> 00:02:10.520
about how we got the best return on investment for fuel efficient technologies.

38
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.720
And if, if it's cool, I'll, I'll sort of set, set this up because it does,

39
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.800
it comes into sort of the story of some of these scenarios. Um, so

40
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.160
at, when I studied the drivers,

41
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.630
you had this like complete difference in driving

42
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.510
tasks. Like we were talking about before with long haul and city, right.

43
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.390
And you're not paid in the city, you've got congestion,

44
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.750
the turns are tight. Um, there's lots of, you know, pedestrians and, you know,

45
00:02:40.751 --> 00:02:43.390
all the things that self-driving trucks, don't like truckers, don't like,

46
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.060
&lt;laugh&gt; right. And they're not paid. There's lots of waiting time.

47
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.300
And then in the highway, they get to cruise, they're getting paid,

48
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.660
they have control. They go at their own pace. They're making money.

49
00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:58.740
They're happy. Well, it turned out, I guess it was around 2010.

50
00:02:58.741 --> 00:03:01.800
This is still when we were thinking about regenerative braking, you know,

51
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.840
and hybrid trucks being sort of like the solution, um,

52
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.440
the problems with them sort of, and, and the advantages, you know,

53
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.920
also split on what I was thinking of kind of the rural,

54
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.480
urban divide at that time. Right. So like you got the regenerative breaking,

55
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.150
right? Um, you can make rock lighter, you can keep it local. Right. Um,

56
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.510
you don't get any benefit from that, you know, hybrid electric in the,

57
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.230
uh, in the rural highway, you want aerodynamics, right? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

58
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680
um,

59
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.910
there you want low rolling resistance tires and these super aerodynamics sleek

60
00:03:34.911 --> 00:03:38.510
trucks. Right. Um, where we know with off the shelf technology today,

61
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.300
we could double the fuel economy more than double the fuel economy of the

62
00:03:42.301 --> 00:03:47.180
typical truck in that highway segment, if we segmented the duty cycle. Right.

63
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.580
And so in the urban environment, you want a clean burning truck.

64
00:03:50.581 --> 00:03:52.980
So you're not giving kids asthma. You want it lighter.

65
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.940
So it's not destroying those, those less, um, strong pavements, right? Um,

66
00:03:57.941 --> 00:03:59.420
you're not, you can make tighter turns.

67
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.090
You don't need a sleeper cab cuz the driver, you know,

68
00:04:02.091 --> 00:04:04.810
hopefully is getting home at night, right in the long haul.

69
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.890
You want that super aerodynamic stuff.

70
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.490
Now that doesn't get you anything in the city.

71
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.290
And in fact it causes all kinds of problems cuz you, you turn too tight,

72
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.810
you crunch up all the aerodynamics that connect the, the,

73
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.290
the tractor and the trailer. So the idea that I had was like, okay,

74
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.560
what if we deliberately cemented it?

75
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.760
Like what if we created these drop lots outside cities? Mm-hmm,

76
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.920
&lt;affirmative&gt; where, you know, a local city driver who's paid by the hour,

77
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.000
kind of runs these trailers out once they're loaded, you know,

78
00:04:32.001 --> 00:04:34.440
doesn't sit there and wait while it's being loaded, they drop off a trailer,

79
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.000
they go pick up one that's loaded. They run it out when it's loaded,

80
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:40.400
they call 'em and they just run 'em out there and stage 'em it's like an Uber

81
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.390
driver, but for uh, truckloads. Yeah. And we have like intermodal, we have like,

82
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.510
we have basically,

83
00:04:46.511 --> 00:04:49.790
this would be the equivalent of like rail to truck intermodal mm-hmm

84
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.550
&lt;affirmative&gt; right. So you put it on the rail and then, you know,

85
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.310
a truck trucker picks it up and delivers it. Right.

86
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.870
So instead of having the rail you'd have these super aerodynamic hopefully

87
00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.990
platoons or, or,

88
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.620
or what was at the time was called long combination in vehicles,

89
00:05:01.621 --> 00:05:03.780
which is basically two trailers connected together. Right.

90
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.700
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; cause this is like a huge productivity gain. Right. Um,

91
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.020
and then instead of that driver like me,

92
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.700
I would pick up something in upstate New York or drive to Michigan drive to

93
00:05:11.701 --> 00:05:14.660
Alabama, you know, drive to Wisconsin, drive to Florida. You know,

94
00:05:14.661 --> 00:05:18.300
I get home every two weeks. If I'm just running that, you know, um,

95
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.530
that double trailer, I might be able back and forth from Chicago to Detroit.

96
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.330
Right. Take two trailers there, pick up two trailers going back. Right.

97
00:05:27.331 --> 00:05:28.570
And be home every night.

98
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:31.170
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; now the problem with that at the time, or one of 'em was,

99
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.210
you know, bridge weights. So you, can't not all bridges can handle that.

100
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.370
Um, that much weight on them, they can't handle these doubles. Right.

101
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:40.930
And some places can, some places can't.

102
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.080
And so this put two tuning idea was happening at the same time.

103
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.360
And we ended up on the same panel and the founders were like, Hey,

104
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.840
so what's it like to follow really close behind another truck,

105
00:05:51.841 --> 00:05:54.360
which was kind of the, the stage that they were at was like, you know,

106
00:05:54.361 --> 00:05:57.560
what's that experience gonna be like? And I was like, it truckers,

107
00:05:57.561 --> 00:05:59.600
aren't gonna like it. You know, I mean that,

108
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:02.520
that's just like the Cardinal rule is following distance.

109
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.920
Like that's the one you really shouldn't violate. Right. Um, and,

110
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:06.840
and when you're out on the road,

111
00:06:06.841 --> 00:06:09.440
like you have that trucker like right on your mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know,

112
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.400
people remember that they don't remember the 99.9% of truckers that are

113
00:06:14.401 --> 00:06:17.750
not on their, you know, like they they're very careful.

114
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.270
<v 0>About that. But when you're, when the trucks are really close together,</v>

115
00:06:20.271 --> 00:06:24.430
there's benefits in terms of aerodynamics. So that's the, that's the idea.

116
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:29.070
So like, if you want to get some benefits of, uh, a platoon,

117
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:30.550
you want them to be close together,

118
00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.270
but you're saying that's very uncomfortable for truckers. Yeah.

119
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.230
<v 1>So, I mean, I think that ended up at the, I mean, Peloton I think is,</v>

120
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.860
is sort of winding down, um, their, their work on this. Um,

121
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.060
and I think that ended up being still an open question, like,

122
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.940
and I had a chance to interview a couple drivers who, um, at least one,

123
00:06:47.941 --> 00:06:51.100
maybe two of which had had actually driven in their platoons. Um,

124
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.820
and I got completely different experiences. Um, some of 'em were like,

125
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.220
it's really cool. You know,

126
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.530
I'm like in communication with that out other driver, um, you know,

127
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.410
I can see on a screen what what's out out, you know, the front of his truck. Um,

128
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.410
and then somewhere like it's too close. Um,

129
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.290
and it might be one of those things that's just to, you know,

130
00:07:08.291 --> 00:07:10.730
takes an adjustment to, to sort of get there. Um,

131
00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:14.570
so you get the aerodynamic advantage, which, which, you know, saves fuel. Um,

132
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:16.770
there's some problems though, right? So, you know,

133
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.280
you're getting that a dynamic,

134
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.440
a advantage because there's a low pressure system in front of that following

135
00:07:22.441 --> 00:07:23.720
truck mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, but the,

136
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.720
the engine is designed with higher pressure, um, feeding that engine. Right.

137
00:07:28.721 --> 00:07:31.720
So there, there are sort of adjustments that you need to make and, you know,

138
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.320
still the benefits are,

139
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.200
are there that's one scenario and that's just the automation of that

140
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:42.150
acceleration and breaking Starsky, which, um, you know, um,

141
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.790
probably a, a lot of your listeners heard, heard about, um,

142
00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:49.510
was working on another scenario, which was, you know,

143
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:53.230
to solve that local problem was gonna do teleoperation right. Uh,

144
00:07:53.231 --> 00:07:57.470
sort of remote piloting. Um, I had the chance to, you know, sort of watch,

145
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.300
watch them do that. It was, you know, they, they drove a,

146
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.740
a truck in Florida from, um, from San Francisco in,

147
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.580
in one of their office offices. Uh, that was, that was really interesting.
