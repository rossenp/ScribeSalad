1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.660
<v 0>You mentioned the elephant and the, the monkey riding the elephant and, uh,</v>

2
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.460
consciousness is the monkey.

3
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.100
And there's some prodding that the monkey gets to do.

4
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.020
And sometimes the elephant listens.

5
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.020
I heard you got into some content, maybe you can correct me,

6
00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:24.970
but I heard you got into some contentious free little discussions. Uh,

7
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.890
is this with Sam Harris or something like that?

8
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.330
<v 1>Not, not that I know of.</v>

9
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.170
<v 0>Some people on clubhouse told me you made a, a bunch of, uh, um,</v>

10
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.770
big debate points about free will. Well, let me just then ask you where,

11
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.650
where in terms of the monkey and the elephant, uh,

12
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.160
do you think we land in terms of the illusion of free will,

13
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.320
how much control does the monkey have?

14
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.480
<v 1>Uh, we have to think about what the, um, free will is in the first place.</v>

15
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.560
We are not the machine.

16
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.440
We are not the thing that is making the decisions we are model of that decision

17
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.640
making process. Yeah.

18
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.590
And there is a difference between making your own decisions and

19
00:01:05.591 --> 00:01:07.270
predicting your own decisions. Yes.

20
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.270
And that difference is the first person perspective

21
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.750
and what, um, basically makes decision making. Um,

22
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.350
and the conditions of free will distinct from just automatically doing the best

23
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.190
thing is that, uh, we often don't know what the best thing is.

24
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.100
You make decisions under uncertainty.

25
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.300
We make informed bets using a betting algorithm that we don't yet understand

26
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:33.300
because we haven't reversed engineered our own minds efficiently.

27
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.140
We don't know the expected rewards.

28
00:01:35.141 --> 00:01:38.180
We don't know the mechanism by which we estimate the rewards and so on,

29
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.900
but there is an algorithm we observe ourselves performing mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;

30
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.650
where we see that, uh, we wait facts in factors and the future,

31
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.450
and then some kind of possibilities.

32
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.490
Some motive gets raised to an intention and that's informed bet that the system

33
00:01:54.491 --> 00:01:57.570
is making and that making of the informed bet,

34
00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.850
the representation of that is what we call free will.

35
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.930
And it seems to be paradoxical because we think that's the crucial thing is

36
00:02:04.931 --> 00:02:09.520
about it that somehow deterministic. And yet, if it was deterministic,

37
00:02:09.521 --> 00:02:14.400
it would be random. And it cannot be random because it was, if it was random,

38
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.960
if just di were being thrown in the universe, randomly forces you to do things,

39
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.040
it would be meaningless.

40
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.000
So the important part of the decisions is always the deterministic stuff, but,

41
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.460
um,

42
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.910
it appears to be determin to you because it's unpredictable because if it was

43
00:02:28.911 --> 00:02:32.590
predictable, you wouldn't experience it as a free will decision, right?

44
00:02:32.591 --> 00:02:35.870
You would experience it as just doing the necessary right thing.

45
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.310
And you see this continuum between the free will and the execution of

46
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:44.950
automatic behavior when you are observing other people. So for instance,

47
00:02:44.951 --> 00:02:46.740
when you are observing your own children, &lt;affirmative&gt;,

48
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.780
if you don't understand them, you will, uh,

49
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.460
use this agent model where you have a agent with a set point generator mm-hmm

50
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.220
&lt;affirmative&gt; and, uh, the agent is doing the best.

51
00:02:56.221 --> 00:02:58.540
It can to minimize the difference of the set point.

52
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.080
And it might be confused and, uh, sometimes impulsive of whatever,

53
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.400
but it's acting on its own free will mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

54
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.600
And when you understand what happens in the mind of the child,

55
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.480
you see that it's automatic and you can out model the child.

56
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.560
You can build things around the child that will lead the child to making exactly

57
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.590
the decision that you are predicting. And in under these circumstances,

58
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.950
like when you are a stage musician or somebody who is dealing, uh,

59
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.110
with people that this you sell a car to,

60
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.190
and you completely understand the psychology and the impulses and the space of

61
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.830
thoughts that this individual can have at that moment under these circumstances

62
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.550
makes no sense to attribute free will because it's no longer decision making

63
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.540
certainty. You are already certain for them, there's uncertainty,

64
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.060
but you already know what they're doing.

65
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.940
<v 0>But what about for you?</v>

66
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.540
So is this akin to like systems like cellular or ATO

67
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.860
where it's deterministic,

68
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.860
but when you squint your eyes a little bit,

69
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.450
it starts look like there's agents making decisions at the higher

70
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.370
sort of when you zoom out and look at the entities that are

71
00:04:08.371 --> 00:04:12.530
composed by the individual cells, even though the there's, uh,

72
00:04:12.531 --> 00:04:16.130
underlying simple rules that, uh,

73
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.810
make the system evolve in deterministic ways,

74
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.160
it looks like there's organisms making decisions is that where

75
00:04:24.161 --> 00:04:27.520
the illusion of free will emerges at jump and scale.

76
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.920
<v 1>It's a particular type of model, but this jump and scale is crucial.</v>

77
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.920
The jump and scale happens whenever you have too many parts to count and you

78
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:37.200
cannot make a model at that level.

79
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.960
And you try to find some higher level regularity.

80
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.030
And the higher level regularity is a pattern that you project into the world to

81
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.230
make sense of it. And agency is one of these patterns, right?

82
00:04:48.231 --> 00:04:52.670
You have all these cells that interact with each other and the cells in our body

83
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.070
are set up in such a way that they benefit if their behavior is coherent,

84
00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.510
which means that they act as if they were serving a common goal, right.

85
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.740
And that means that they will evolve regulation mechanisms that, uh,

86
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.660
act as if they were serving a common goal. And now you can make sense of these,

87
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.140
all these cells by projecting the common goal into.

88
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.940
<v 0>Them, right? So for you then free world is an illusion.</v>

89
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.260
<v 1>No, it's a model. And it's a construct.</v>

90
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.980
It's basically a model that the system is making of its own behavior.

91
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.210
And it's a model that it can come up with under the circumstances,

92
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.610
and it can get replaced by a different model, which is automatic behavior.

93
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.450
And you fully understand the mechanism under which you're acting.

94
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.690
<v 0>Yeah. But the another word for model is what story.</v>

95
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.690
So it's a story you're telling. I mean, do you actually have control?

96
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.250
Is there such a thing as a you,

97
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.440
and is thing is you have in control. So like, are you

98
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.880
manifesting your evolution as a, as a entity,

99
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.440
in.

100
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.320
<v 1>Some sense, the, you as the model of the system that is in control,</v>

101
00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.920
it's a story that the system tells itself about somebody who is in control.

102
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:02.180
Yeah.

103
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.600
And the contents of that model are being used to inform the behavior of the

104
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:06.434
system.

105
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.200
<v 0>Okay. So.</v>

106
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.520
<v 1>The system is completely mechanical mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and the system creates</v>

107
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.080
that story, like a loom. And then, uh,

108
00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:19.910
it uses the contents of that story to inform its actions and writes the

109
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:21.710
results of that actions into the.

110
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.390
<v 0>Story. So how's that non illusion, the story is written then,</v>

111
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.670
or a rather we're not the writers of the story.

112
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:33.690
<v 1>Yes. But we always knew that.</v>

113
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.140
<v 0>No, we, we don't know that. When did we know that? I.</v>

114
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.180
<v 1>Think that's mostly a confusion about concepts. The, uh,</v>

115
00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:45.860
conceptual illusion in our culture comes from the idea that we live in physical

116
00:06:45.861 --> 00:06:46.860
reality mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

117
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.580
and that we experience physical reality and that you have ideas about it. Yep.

118
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.700
And then you have this, uh,

119
00:06:51.701 --> 00:06:55.220
dual list interpretation where you have two substances, uh,

120
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.780
re extends the world that you can touch.

121
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.050
And that is made of extended things and risk congregants,

122
00:07:01.051 --> 00:07:03.410
which is the world of ideas. And in fact,

123
00:07:03.411 --> 00:07:05.090
both of them are mental representations.

124
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.650
One is the representations of the world as a game engine that your mind

125
00:07:09.651 --> 00:07:13.290
generates to make sense of the perceptual data and the other ones, the world.

126
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.450
Yes. That's what we perceive as the physical world.

127
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.290
But we already know that the physical world is nothing like that. Right. Front,

128
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.240
the mechanics is very different from what you, you and me perceive as the world,

129
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.520
the world, you and me perceive as a game engine. Yeah. And, uh,

130
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.320
no colors and sounds in the physical world,

131
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.840
they only exist in the game engine generated by your brain.

132
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.560
And then you have ideas that are not, cannot be mapped onto extended regions.

133
00:07:35.561 --> 00:07:39.470
Right? So the objects that have a spatial extension in the game engine, uh,

134
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.630
Reza and the objects that don't have a physical extension in the game, uh,

135
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.190
engine are ideas.

136
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:49.990
And they both interact in our mind to produce models of the world. Yep. But.

137
00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:52.470
<v 0>You know, when you play video games,</v>

138
00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:58.270
I understand that what's actually happening is zeros and ones inside of, uh,

139
00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:03.300
an side of a computer side of a CPU and a GPU.

140
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:08.500
But you're still seeing like, uh, the rendering of that.

141
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.900
And you're still making decisions whether to shoot,

142
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.660
to turn left or to turn right.

143
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.620
If you're playing a shooter or every time I start thinking about Skyra and El

144
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:21.810
scrolls, uh, and walk can run a beautiful nature and swinging a sword,

145
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:25.370
but it feels like you're making decisions inside that video game.

146
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.530
So even though you don't have direct access, uh,

147
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:33.650
in terms of perception to the, to the bits, to the zeros and ones,

148
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:38.250
it still feels like you're making decisions and your decisions are actually

149
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:43.480
feels like they're being applied all the way down to the zeros and ones. Yes.

150
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.360
So it feels like you have control, even though you don't direct yes.

151
00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:47.520
Access to reality.

152
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.280
<v 1>So there is basically a special character in the video game that is being</v>

153
00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:53.160
created by the video game engine. Yep.

154
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:57.560
And this character is serving the aesthetics of the video game, and that is you.

155
00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:58.660
Yes.

156
00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.240
<v 0>But I feel like I have control inside the video game.</v>

157
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:06.920
Like all those like 12 year olds that kick my on the internet. So,

158
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:07.520
uh.

159
00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.480
<v 1>For when you play the video game, it doesn't really matter that there's zeros.</v>

160
00:09:10.481 --> 00:09:12.720
And once right, you don't care about the vis of the past.

161
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:16.470
You don't care about the nature of the PO that advance on what you care about

162
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.550
are the properties of the game that you're playing.

163
00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:21.550
And you hope that the CPU is good enough. Yes.

164
00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:24.070
And a similar thing happens when we interact with physics,

165
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.950
the world that you and me are in is not the physical world,

166
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.310
the world that you and me are in is a dream world.

167
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:32.670
<v 0>How close is it to the real world though?</v>

168
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:36.180
<v 1>Uh, we know that it's not very close,</v>

169
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.020
but we know that the dynamics of the dream world match the dynamics of the

170
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.420
physical world to a certain degree of resolution, right?

171
00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:47.420
The causal structure of the dream world is different. So you see, for instance,

172
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:50.500
waves crashing on your feet, right. But there are no waves in the ocean.

173
00:09:50.501 --> 00:09:53.540
There's only water molecules that have tangents, uh,

174
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.930
between the molecules that are, uh, to ex uh,

175
00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:00.930
the result of electrons in the molecules, interacting with each other.

176
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.210
<v 0>But aren't, they like very consistent we're, we're just seeing a very, uh,</v>

177
00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:09.970
crude approximation. Isn't our dream world, very consistent,

178
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:15.130
like to the point of being mapped directly one to one to the actual physical

179
00:10:15.131 --> 00:10:17.120
world, as opposed to, uh,

180
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.200
us being completely tricked is this is like where you have, like,

181
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.080
that's not a trick.

182
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.600
<v 1>That's, that's my point. It's not an illusion. It's a form of data compression.</v>

183
00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:24.921
Yeah. Yeah.

184
00:10:24.921 --> 00:10:28.520
It's an attempt to deal with the dynamics of too many parts to count at the

185
00:10:28.521 --> 00:10:31.440
level at which we're entangled with the best model that you can find.

186
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:35.760
<v 0>Yeah. So we can act in that dream world and our actions have impact in the,</v>

187
00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.750
in the real world, in the physical world. Yes. To which we don't have access.

188
00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:40.250
Yes.

189
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.070
<v 1>But it's basically like, uh,</v>

190
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.390
accepting the fact that the software that we live in,

191
00:10:44.391 --> 00:10:48.430
the dream that you live in is generated by something outside of this world that

192
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:48.910
you and me are.

193
00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:52.470
<v 0>In. So is the software deterministic and do we not have any control?</v>

194
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:57.860
So do we have &lt;laugh&gt; so free will in is, uh,

195
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.300
having a conscious being FreeWheel,

196
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.580
is the monkey being able to steer the elephant? &lt;laugh&gt;.

197
00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.420
<v 1>No, uh, it's, it's slightly different basically in the same way,</v>

198
00:11:10.421 --> 00:11:14.180
as you are modeling, uh, the bottom molecules in the ocean that in Gulf,

199
00:11:14.181 --> 00:11:16.340
your feet, when you are walking on the beach yeah.

200
00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.490
As waves and there are of waves, uh,

201
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:22.530
but only the atoms on more complicated stuff underneath the atoms and so on.

202
00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:26.530
And you know that right. Uh, you would accept. Yes. Uh,

203
00:11:26.531 --> 00:11:28.850
there is a certain abstraction that happens here.

204
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:33.410
It's a simplification of what happens and simplification that is designed in

205
00:11:33.411 --> 00:11:37.090
such a way that your brain can deal with it temporarily and spatially in terms

206
00:11:37.091 --> 00:11:39.880
of resources and tuned for the predictive value.

207
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.440
So you can predict with some accuracy,

208
00:11:42.441 --> 00:11:44.160
whether your feet are going to get wet or not.

209
00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:48.920
<v 0>But it's a really good, it's a really good interface and approximation. Yes.</v>

210
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.360
It's equal squared is a good equations, are good approximation. Yes.

211
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:58.320
For what they're much better approximation. So to me,

212
00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:02.560
waves is a really nice approximation of what's all the complexity that's

213
00:12:02.561 --> 00:12:03.480
happening underneath. Basically.

214
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.800
<v 1>It's a mission learning model that is constantly tuned to minimize surprises.</v>

215
00:12:06.801 --> 00:12:09.600
So it basically tries to predict as well as it can.

216
00:12:09.601 --> 00:12:11.480
What you're going to perceive next. Are we talking about.

217
00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:16.190
<v 0>Which is the machine learning, our perception system or the dream world?</v>

218
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:21.110
<v 1>The machine world is dream world is the result of the machine learning process</v>

219
00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:22.390
of the perception system.

220
00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:23.350
<v 0>That's doing the compression.</v>

221
00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:24.950
<v 1>Yes. And, uh,</v>

222
00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:29.910
the model of you as an agent is not a different type of model or it's,

223
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:33.380
it's a different type, but not, uh, not different as in its model,

224
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.900
like nature from the, um, model of the ocean, right? Some things are oceans,

225
00:12:37.901 --> 00:12:40.100
some things are agents. And, uh,

226
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.940
one of these agents is using your own control model, the output of your model,

227
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.980
the things that you perceive yourself as doing mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. And, uh,

228
00:12:47.981 --> 00:12:48.814
that is you.

229
00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:52.900
<v 0>What about the fact that is like, when you're standing,</v>

230
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:59.370
um, and with, with the water on your feet, and you're looking out into the vest,

231
00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.970
like open water of the ocean,

232
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:06.690
and then there's a beautiful sunset and it, it, well,

233
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:09.930
the fact that it's beautiful and then maybe you have like friends or a loved one

234
00:13:09.931 --> 00:13:13.490
with you and like, you feel love. What is that as the dream world? What is that?

235
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:14.390
Yeah.

236
00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:17.240
<v 1>It's all, uh, happening inside of the dream. Okay.</v>

237
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.600
<v 0>But see the word dream makes it seem like it's not real.</v>

238
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:27.720
<v 1>Yeah, of course. It's not real. The, uh, the physical universe is real,</v>

239
00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:31.280
but the physical universe is incomprehensible and it doesn't have any feeling of

240
00:13:31.281 --> 00:13:35.270
realness. The feeling of realness that you experience gets at catch to certain

241
00:13:35.271 --> 00:13:39.190
representations where your brain assesses, this is the best model of reality.

242
00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:39.990
<v 0>That I have.</v>

243
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:43.910
So the only thing that's real to you is the thing that's happening at the very

244
00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:46.310
base of reality. Like.

245
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:51.910
<v 1>The, the, yeah. For something to be real, it needs to be implemented. So, uh,</v>

246
00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:55.980
the model that you have of reality is, uh, real in as far as it is a model,

247
00:13:55.981 --> 00:13:56.650
right?

248
00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:00.660
It's an appropriate description of the world to say that there are models that

249
00:14:00.661 --> 00:14:03.340
are being experienced. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, but, uh,

250
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.380
the world that you experience is not necessarily implemented.
