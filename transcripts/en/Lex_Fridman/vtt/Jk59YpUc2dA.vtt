00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.560
<v 0>Friendship is you get what you give, you, get what you give.</v>

2
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.020
And if you are there for people,

3
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.600
you are going to feel so good about having done that.

4
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.770
And then the, the,

5
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.050
the reciprocation effect,

6
00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:22.140
which you'd probably know very well is so great in the world.

7
00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:26.040
That any time you're kind to people, you build this incredible bond.

8
00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:28.380
And then what, what are we at the end of the day, Lex,

9
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.100
besides a series of memories with the people we love,

10
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.930
that's all it is. It's just a series of memories and moments.

11
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.950
It's just moments you ever see blade runner. Yes, of course.

12
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.740
You remember what Rutger Hauer says at the end,

13
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.000
all of these memories gone like tears in the rain. I mean, that's our existence.

14
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.880
It just all goes away. At some point, it's just these drops of rain. Each,

15
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.520
each of those memories, just like one snowflake or one drop of rain.

16
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.280
And they're all lost at some point, but they're here now.

17
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.920
And that's why we have to be there for each other.

18
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.900
That's why I feel like what I do is so important in this world and I get such

19
00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:10.260
great meaning out of it, just being a friend, just having these conversations,

20
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.810
what you're doing on your podcast,

21
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.910
just talking to intelligent people and spreading the word and the disciple,

22
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.760
the gospel of what they're saying and amplifying it. You're inspiring.

23
00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:23.250
So many people, every podcast, you get 500,000 people,

24
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:27.570
a million people watch these videos and there's some kid in Sri Lanka or some

25
00:01:27.571 --> 00:01:30.660
little girl in Afghanistan. Who's going to stumble upon this on YouTube.

26
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.250
And they're going to change the world in the next century because it's not just

27
00:01:35.251 --> 00:01:39.330
about America, our stories almost over, right?

28
00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:42.450
Like we were the story of the last two or 300 years. I hope it keeps going,

29
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.170
but there's all these other places in the world, San Paulo and Africa,

30
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.360
where people now have access to these videos and somebody will

31
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.090
have this video and go, Elon did it. Oh, and that guy,

32
00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:57.810
Jason was his friend and Oh, and then Lex, does those interviews with the,

33
00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.160
Oh yeah. I could do it too.

34
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.790
<v 1>Little magical moment of love amidst the suffering with Elon because you've</v>

35
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:07.130
talked about it. It'll have these ripple effects.

36
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.270
It's fascinating to think about what's to come in new entrepreneurs,

37
00:02:11.271 --> 00:02:12.440
being born new,

38
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.510
more love being put out there in a more support through these rough

39
00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:21.830
times when your people are trying to create new things. I mean, that's a,

40
00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:23.750
that's a beautiful thing. That's a beautiful, I,

41
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.900
I'm glad you think of friendship in this way.

42
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.380
I'm deeply grateful that you're loyal.

43
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.790
<v 0>Every time you invest you are. Here's the thing. Cost question,</v>

44
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:37.160
nothing to make this investment either the,

45
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.170
the amount of time it takes to be bitter or angry, uh, sitting at home,

46
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.300
uh, to be disappointed. You,

47
00:02:45.301 --> 00:02:49.640
you could just channel that same amount of energy into being loyal, loving kind,

48
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.720
and there for people. It just only takes the intention, right?

49
00:02:53.721 --> 00:02:56.570
The water is going to those emotions are going to flow, right?

50
00:02:56.571 --> 00:02:59.120
Like Sam would always tell me when I was struggling in my life.

51
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.620
And I talked to him, he'd say, you know, Jason, your brain is spewing.

52
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:05.380
All of these ideas. Imagine you're standing,

53
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.990
sitting by a river and the river is all your ideas.

54
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.220
You are not a slave to any one of these ideas to just whipping by like each of

55
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:13.480
those little waves in the river,

56
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.530
you can pick one of those ideas out and look at it and examine it and either

57
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:21.430
keep it or throw it back in the river and let it go. And I was like, wow, Sam,

58
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:24.310
that was like my entire friendship with Sam Harris.

59
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.480
That was like the one moment where I was just like, Oh my God, all my life.

60
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.460
I've wondered about all these thoughts in my head, insecurities, you know,

61
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.540
imposter syndrome. Like I didn't go to MIT. You know,

62
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.670
I'm not the smartest guy, but somehow I made a career writing,

63
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:46.120
a little 50 K checks and now, you know, $3 million checks, but whatever,

64
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:46.301
you know,

65
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:49.300
little checks and being a journalist and doing this little podcast and it's

66
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.890
added, it's ended up to something. And I kind of, I'm proud of it. I'm 50.

67
00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:56.040
And I'm kind of proud of what I did. And I,

68
00:03:56.041 --> 00:04:00.310
and I wake up every morning and I've retired. I say, kinda like what I do.

69
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.570
I kinda like having the conversation and writing the check and then being on

70
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:07.720
somebody's team. And I got offered to be in these giant mega funds.

71
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.230
And they said, Jason, you're an idiot. You invest in 60 companies a year,

72
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.220
you know, 500 K at a time, you put $30 million a year to work,

73
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.280
come work with us, write one $50 million check.

74
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:24.040
And then you can go to Aspen and Cabo and Coachella and not

75
00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:27.310
work, but why are you doing all this work?

76
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.840
It's like pull the $50 million check is like, it's like a formality.

77
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:34.810
It's just like being an ATM. Like the companies are already huge by that time.

78
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.330
I really want to meet the two people with the idea.

79
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.950
I want to meet them in year one. I want to meet them in day zero.

80
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.980
I want to be the guy who wrote the first, second or third check.

81
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.360
I want a guy with 3000 check the last check. It's boring.

82
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.880
<v 1>And make that basic human connection and also be there and be with me through</v>

83
00:04:53.881 --> 00:04:58.770
the rough times, be with them with that first. I mean the first early successes,

84
00:04:58.771 --> 00:04:59.650
I mean, that's a beautiful.

85
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.260
<v 0>So great when they, when, when,</v>

86
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.330
when a founder and the team get product market fit and you just know

87
00:05:06.331 --> 00:05:10.260
it's going to work. Oh man, Lex it's when,

88
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.310
when calm would email me and they'd say we hadn't, you know,

89
00:05:14.311 --> 00:05:16.830
the company has been growing and we're not going to go out of business,

90
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.540
but we added some sleep stuff. And then we added this other fee function and,

91
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.600
uh, we have a streak now and, uh,

92
00:05:24.601 --> 00:05:29.280
we grew 10 X in the less we know, three months. And, uh,

93
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.970
we're good. You know, I was like, Oh, that's nice. That's real nice. It's like,

94
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.640
it's a nice feeling when you will, because so many of them die.

95
00:05:35.641 --> 00:05:40.080
We talked about that J curve early. Imagine it's like, um,

96
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.070
it's like all these baby turtles going out to the ocean and the seagulls are

97
00:05:44.071 --> 00:05:47.160
ripping them to shreds. And then their sharks are eating them.

98
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.770
But then like a couple of the turtles make it.

99
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.540
And they become wise old hundred year old turtles, you know? And you're like,

100
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.780
yep. I remember when you catched. And like, all of your brothers and sisters.

101
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.880
<v 2>Were ripped to shreds by the seagulls that you made.</v>

102
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.640
<v 0>It into the water, and then you made it out to the deep water.</v>

103
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.770
<v 2>I think there's no better way to end it.</v>

104
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.440
The talk of the cruelty of life that's suffering that is life and the love.

105
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.370
Miss the suffering. Jason. Absolutely. I've been a fan of yours for a long time.

106
00:06:18.371 --> 00:06:22.090
You're one of the most special people in Silicon Valley.

107
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.610
And maybe you'll also call me in one of the rough times. Sure. There'll be many.

108
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.750
<v 0>Yeah. You know, there's one expression. Nobody gets her alone.</v>

109
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:33.880
Nobody gets her alone.

110
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.080
And anybody who thinks that they got their alone is delusional and kidding

111
00:06:38.081 --> 00:06:40.630
themselves. And they will at some point wake up and realize, Oh,

112
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.130
there were a lot of people helped me get here. I need to write a couple of.

113
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.560
<v 2>Gratitude letters. I got a gratitude letter the other day from.</v>

114
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.380
<v 0>A friend of mine who I helped. And I was one of the, you know,</v>

115
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.960
about these gratitude letters people are writing.

116
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.520
It turns out Martin Seligman and, um, uh,

117
00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.710
with an authentic happiness. Anyway,

118
00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:01.870
the guy who really studied happiness and joy,

119
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:07.210
it turns out one of the greatest amplifiers of joy in your life is to thank

120
00:07:07.211 --> 00:07:08.710
somebody for doing something for you.

121
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:13.060
And somebody who had helped just wrote me a letter.

122
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.420
And I got in Christmas and I had the stack of Christmas cards and I hadn't

123
00:07:16.421 --> 00:07:19.150
opened them. And it's the second week of January.

124
00:07:19.151 --> 00:07:22.990
And I was just getting to like the last stack and I opened it up and I almost

125
00:07:22.991 --> 00:07:27.010
missed it. This is incredibly heartwarming letter about how meaningful,

126
00:07:27.011 --> 00:07:31.210
like certain things I had done to help along the way and how he'd always,

127
00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.530
always appreciated my counsel. And I was just like, well,

128
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.390
this happened 25 years ago.

129
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.800
And you wrote this letter now and it just hit me like a ton of bricks.

130
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.560
I was just like, wow. You know, if you're hearing this,

131
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.490
there's probably 10 people who were really instrumental in your lives and your

132
00:07:48.491 --> 00:07:53.470
lives, go ahead and call them on the phone, write them an email, or even better,

133
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:58.510
just write a letter and send it to them and just tell them you're thankful.

134
00:07:58.511 --> 00:07:59.620
And let me tell you something,

135
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.720
the amplification of joy in your life will go a hundred X, a hundred X.

136
00:08:04.721 --> 00:08:08.710
When you tell somebody you love them and that you really appreciate them and

137
00:08:08.711 --> 00:08:12.070
that what they did for you was magical. So just then you can look it up.

138
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.480
Gratitude. Gratitude is like one of these incredible forces. Amen. I'm grateful.

139
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:18.430
I'm good.

140
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.890
<v 2>Wasted all this time.</v>
