00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.530
<v 0>Do you know what Jordan Peterson thinks about Bitcoin and about,</v>

2
00:00:05.531 --> 00:00:10.330
about the future impact about, of Bitcoin on the society?

3
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.850
<v 1>No, I don't actually. Um,</v>

4
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.210
we're hopefully gonna be talking to him soon about that. We did a,

5
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.560
a book club on his book maps of meaning and he engaged with about it.

6
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.840
So we're hoping to deliver the orange bill to Mr. Peterson,

7
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.080
the orange bill &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt;. I think his audience, um,

8
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.320
is one of the most important audiences in the world to understand Bitcoin,

9
00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:37.160
these people that are conscientious and responsible.

10
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.280
Um,

11
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.830
I think they'll quickly understand Bitcoin's value proposition &lt;affirmative&gt; and

12
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.830
help elucidate it to the world.

13
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.790
<v 0>I'm trying to remember what he said about, about it. Basically.</v>

14
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.670
I think his support of Bitcoin is grounded in the kind of

15
00:00:54.671 --> 00:00:57.710
people who are opposing Bitcoin mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

16
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.470
So without understanding Bitcoin,

17
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.990
he starts to like Bitcoin because of the people who are opposing it.

18
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.620
He's, you know, you start to, I mean,

19
00:01:07.621 --> 00:01:11.220
that's partially why I am interested in Bitcoin.

20
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.100
It's like all the people in, uh,

21
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.860
in power mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and all the kind of shady,

22
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.180
fraudulent and non genuine people who are dismissing

23
00:01:23.181 --> 00:01:27.490
Bitcoin. Yeah. Uh, are making me think, Hmm. One of.

24
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.130
<v 1>One of, uh,</v>

25
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.730
Jordan's definitions of God is he says,

26
00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:36.890
God is found in the truthful speech that rectifies pathological hierarchies.

27
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.183
And

28
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.210
I think that is a beautiful definition of what Bitcoin is doing in the world.

29
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.400
And that have this pathological hierarchy called central banking by which

30
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.400
the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, um,

31
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.920
that is used as a mechanism for perpetual theft and funding

32
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.800
warfare at a global scale. Uh, like Ron Paul said,

33
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:06.030
it's no coincidence that the 20th century of total war was also of the century

34
00:02:06.031 --> 00:02:08.230
of central banking. Um,

35
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.590
when you have an institution of currency counterfeiting,

36
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.550
which the central bank is, you are no longer bounded by your own balance sheet.

37
00:02:18.551 --> 00:02:21.470
When you go to war, you don't have to just go to war on your own resources.

38
00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:26.460
You can now pillage the Commonwealth and pull for the savings of society

39
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.460
as a whole, before you go bankrupt. And indeed, this is what Hitler did, right?

40
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.500
Hitler hyperinflated, uh, in the Weimar Republic to,

41
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.500
to fund his war efforts. Um, and frankly, every dictator,

42
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.500
every world war,

43
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.090
every internment camp in history was made possible by

44
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.730
the weaponization of money and Fiat currency.

45
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.250
So I hope I know Jordan Peterson is a huge proponent of free

46
00:02:56.251 --> 00:02:59.600
speech, and I think that's ultimately at, at its deep essence,

47
00:02:59.601 --> 00:03:01.120
that's what Bitcoin really is, right.

48
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.520
It is just the purest form of monetary speech we've ever had.

49
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.520
And by purifying that primary operating system of human action,

50
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.200
I think we can eliminate this pathological hierarchy that is

51
00:03:16.201 --> 00:03:18.910
unfortunately the dominant institution in the world today.

52
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.270
<v 0>Yeah, I I'm definitely, especially with these explorations of Bitcoin, uh,</v>

53
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.470
this journey I've been on,

54
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.870
I'll revisit some of the thi some of the aspects of human history that I've been

55
00:03:29.871 --> 00:03:33.150
looking at, like Stalin and Hitler with a,

56
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.070
from a perspective of a monetary perspective. Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; like,

57
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.060
what are the effects of inflation?

58
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.980
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; how was it used as a tool in, um,

59
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.900
in gaining power and maintaining power in manipulating

60
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.220
the populous in doing, um,

61
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.820
in inflicting suffering and, uh, I would say evil onto the world.

62
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.370
It's interesting. I, it's interesting.

63
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.690
I'm gonna have to sort of go back into the whole,

64
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.410
so I tend to focus more on the human nature.

65
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.210
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and less about the tools that human nature leverages

66
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.010
to effect change, but you're right. That, uh, in some sense,

67
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.920
money &lt;affirmative&gt; is, uh, a tool which can be, uh,

68
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.200
effectively used to, uh,

69
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.800
perform moral and the moral actions, depending on how it's used.

70
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.560
<v 1>And there's a feedback between the two, right. There's um,</v>

71
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.120
specifically with money itself, it's

72
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.030
the inci, uh, here's it,

73
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.990
the way I've been posing it lately is that I actually think we typically think

74
00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:53.470
of people as good or bad, or again, trying to label people all the time.

75
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.270
But I think people and their characters are emergent properties of the incentive

76
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.460
structures they inhabit. Yeah. So &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know,

77
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.940
what does Charlie Munger say? Don't show me the incentives.

78
00:05:04.941 --> 00:05:06.380
I'll show you the outcome kind of thing.

79
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.060
This is a flawed incentive structure we've been operating within now. I'm not,

80
00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:14.980
I'm not speaking to the intention. People wanna argue with me all the time,

81
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.060
like Jerome, Powell's not a bad guy. He's doing his best at the central bank.

82
00:05:19.061 --> 00:05:23.330
He's doing what he thinks. He's right. That's fine. Whether that's true or not.

83
00:05:23.331 --> 00:05:26.650
It actually doesn't matter. The intention is divergent from the outcome.

84
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.450
The institution that they are running is premised on deception and theft,

85
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.770
and it is handicapping the productive economy. So when we're even the terms,

86
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.250
we use printing money, you're not creating any new value.

87
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.210
You're not infusing the economy with anything,

88
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.890
any new productive factors whatsoever.

89
00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.120
You're just harvesting the economic surplus created by entrepreneurs in the

90
00:05:46.121 --> 00:05:47.680
marketplace. There's,

91
00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:52.160
it's impossible to add any value to an economy by increasing the paper claims on

92
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.760
its savings. So, um,

93
00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.040
there's a feedback loop between man and tool between creator and created.

94
00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.240
And I think we have to honor the relationship above either one,

95
00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:08.560
right? Trying to put the right people in the system,

96
00:06:08.561 --> 00:06:10.320
or just build the right system. We need both.

97
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.000
<v 0>Do you think the interesting question,</v>

98
00:06:13.001 --> 00:06:17.870
whether the people that are in control

99
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.750
of central banks or in positions of power there,

100
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.670
if they themselves are malevolent, they themselves are bad actors,

101
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.310
or they're simply like leaves floating along the river,

102
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.950
sort of just the cog, uh, in the machine,

103
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.020
an an and an, a colony that operates in a certain kind of way.

104
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.900
Like where do you put the blame?

105
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.300
Do you put the blame on the way things are operating onto the

106
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.860
individuals or onto the system itself? The idea behind the system,

107
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.250
where, and is it useful to place somewhere?

108
00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.570
Cuz for me it might be useful to understand that in order to figure out what the

109
00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:08.210
solution is, I tend to not put the blame on the individual. Like I,

110
00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.970
I tend to believe most people are good and want to see themselves as good.

111
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.810
And, and so in that case,

112
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.840
it's very difficult to be truly malevolent as you would need to be, to control,

113
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.600
to gain centralized power at the large scale.

114
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.880
But I know a lot of conspiracy theory theorists,

115
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.520
and just a lot of people think that there is evil humans in the world

116
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.560
that seek power, maintain that power. And they use that power for bad purposes.

117
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.870
<v 1>I think they're just people and they're just trying to get something for</v>

118
00:07:41.871 --> 00:07:43.590
nothing. Like all of us do &lt;laugh&gt;.

119
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.190
<v 0>I like this framework of thought that you have well.</v>

120
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.030
<v 1>Yeah, honestly. Yeah. And that's what the central bank is,</v>

121
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:54.430
is the ultimate institution to get something for nothing. You, yeah.

122
00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.310
Get a perpetual income stream,

123
00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:02.380
the ability to acquire more and more territory in the world through

124
00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:04.180
monopolizing the supply of money.

125
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.940
And you can literally print money.

126
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.660
You can buy your way out of anything and buy your way into anything in the

127
00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:14.460
world. So it is, I think the most,

128
00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:17.400
I'd say the most,

129
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.450
but a group of very intelligent people put this thing together and figured out

130
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.810
how to get something for nothing in perpetuity. Um,

131
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:30.690
by clouding people's conception of money. And you know,

132
00:08:30.691 --> 00:08:33.610
if we look at the central bank is it's been around for a while,

133
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:37.290
but the latest implementation, uh, here in the us is the fed, you know,

134
00:08:37.291 --> 00:08:38.290
it's about a hundred years old.

135
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:43.160
It's an analog age institution that I think has lost a lot of its relevance

136
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.200
in the modern age. Um, and I,

137
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.000
I don't think it will survive the ever galvanizing gaze of the digital age.

138
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.920
There's just too much sunlight, um, too much transparency today.

139
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:59.560
Ideas move too quickly for something like this to remain relevant, but

140
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.480
there are just people there are just seeking something for nothing.

141
00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:07.800
But I think when you concentrate that much power and that much control that much

142
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:11.680
wealth into the hands of few, it does change.

143
00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.550
Uh, Hayek argued that nature of power. Again,

144
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.030
it's something that we all sort of desire. We to be completely powerless.

145
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:23.790
You're really unhappy, right? If you're totally powerless, you're a slave.

146
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:28.070
Someone else tells you what to do. You have no autonomy, it's miserable, right?

147
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:29.363
So there's this,

148
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:33.390
it makes the consolidation of power alluring and that we want to protect

149
00:09:33.391 --> 00:09:37.380
ourselves from that slave state, let's say, but like many things,

150
00:09:37.381 --> 00:09:38.380
it can be taken too far.

151
00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.860
And when you concentrate power into too few hands,

152
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.100
Hayek argues that it actually change. It transforms,

153
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.380
it becomes something much more intoxicating than it would be if it was held in a

154
00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:54.820
more distributed way. And I think that gets into a lot of these,

155
00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:56.463
you know, they,

156
00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:59.490
I don't know if they call themselves elites or people call them elites or

157
00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.770
whatever. Like, um, let's say shareholders of central banks,

158
00:10:02.771 --> 00:10:05.450
people participating in the world, economic forum, things like this.

159
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.690
They come, I guess the incentives, right?

160
00:10:09.691 --> 00:10:12.330
The incentive schema they're in is rewarding them,

161
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.770
constantly telling them everything they're doing saying and thinking is correct.

162
00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:17.760
Come. I just keep getting richer all the time.

163
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:23.440
And it leads you closer to this definition of evil, which,

164
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:28.880
um, in the book paradise lost Friedman said evil is the force,

165
00:10:28.881 --> 00:10:30.680
which believes its knowledge is complete.

166
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:35.600
So these people become more and more convinced that

167
00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:41.150
they have the plan or they have the course of action that will save the world

168
00:10:41.151 --> 00:10:42.910
that if everyone would just listen to them,

169
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.950
that they would lead us to the promise land, right?

170
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:50.510
Whether this is bill gates saving us from a climate crisis or, uh,

171
00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:54.310
any of these other economic policies that are targeted at a certain outcome,

172
00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:57.980
but almost always diverge almost perfect from that outcome,

173
00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.500
creating its opposite effect. Um,

174
00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:06.020
I think that's the problem that we have this mechanism that can concentrate

175
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.580
wealth and power into the fan,

176
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:12.100
into the hands of so few that it leads to the proliferation of evil,

177
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.100
um, meaning that it convinces people that their knowledge is complete.

178
00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:21.130
Whereas something like a Bitcoin almost

179
00:11:21.131 --> 00:11:23.210
forces the opposite outcome. It

180
00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:29.010
in a Bitcoin denominated world in a pure free market,

181
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:31.770
the consumer is sovereign.

182
00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:37.210
So you cannot earn value in the world unless you are serving

183
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.233
your fellow man,

184
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:42.760
unless they have through expressed through their buy and sell decisions in the

185
00:11:42.761 --> 00:11:43.800
marketplace, right?

186
00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:48.600
You've created a satisfaction of a particular want that they value so much,

187
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:52.240
they've acquired so much of your good or service that you've become rich.

188
00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:56.640
You can only maintain that position of wealth so long as you continue to serve

189
00:11:56.641 --> 00:11:58.200
your fellow man. So,

190
00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:02.720
and it changes the incentives such that dominance in the world

191
00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:07.040
is no longer can no longer be paired with coercion.

192
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:11.520
It has to be paired with competence. And it's, that's, that's how this,

193
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.150
when we say big Bitcoin and fixes this, that's what we mean.

194
00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:17.270
Like if we're stores that skin in the game,

195
00:12:17.271 --> 00:12:20.790
that balance of incentives and disincentives that help us properly navigate

196
00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:25.150
reality. And it prevents the buildup of systemic rot.

197
00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.870
Like we see with the central bank.
