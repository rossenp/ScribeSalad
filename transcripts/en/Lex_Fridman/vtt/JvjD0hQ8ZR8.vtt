1
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.940
<v 0>But Laden was not a lit scholar. His training was an engineer, you know,</v>

2
00:00:06.941 --> 00:00:09.580
some biographers claim that he was a Playboy for much of his youth,

3
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.540
but really the, the, the, these ideas. And I think that's probably,

4
00:00:13.541 --> 00:00:16.980
I think why they chose the twin towers. I mean, this is, uh,

5
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.040
an imagination fueled by training and engineering. I mean, a lot of the,

6
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.030
you know, the sociology, if you do a kind of post of a lot of these leading, um,

7
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.630
jihadists, their backgrounds are not in Islamic scholarship,

8
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.030
but actually in engineering and kind of practical sciences and, and professions,

9
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.030
medical doctors are, are among their ranks. Um,

10
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.910
and so there's long been attention between Islamic scholars who devote their

11
00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:44.780
whole lives to study of texts and commentary and interpretation.

12
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.020
And then what some scholars call kind of new intellectuals,

13
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.820
new Muslim authorities who actually have secular university educations

14
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.060
often in the natural sciences or engineering in technical fields,

15
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.260
who then bring that kind of mindset, if you will,

16
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.770
to what Muslim scholars call the religious sciences, which are,

17
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.050
you know, a field of kind of ambiguity and of gradation and of

18
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.370
subtlety and nuance,

19
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.490
and really of decades of training before one becomes authoritative to speak

20
00:01:16.491 --> 00:01:19.890
about issues like whether or not it's legitimate to take someone else's life

21
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.800
were the relation to Afghanistan who was bin Laden, bin Laden was a,

22
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.760
a visitor. Um, if we look at his whole life course,

23
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.600
part of it, isn't enigma still, you know,

24
00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:36.800
he is from a Saudi elite family,

25
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.080
but a family that kind of has a,

26
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.520
a Yemeni Arabian C kind of genealogy.

27
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.350
Um, so the has no relationship to Afghanistan pastor present,

28
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.070
except at some point in 1980s,

29
00:01:51.071 --> 00:01:56.070
when he went like thousands of other young Saudis first to Pakistan to places

30
00:01:56.071 --> 00:01:57.270
like Beau on the border,

31
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.830
where they wanted to aid the jihad in some capacity.

32
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.660
And for the most part, the air Stein went, opened up hospitals,

33
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:08.700
some opened up schools,

34
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.140
the bin Laden family had long been based in engineering construction.

35
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.020
So it's thought that he used some of those skills and resources and connections

36
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.620
to build things. Um, you know,

37
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.420
we have images of him firing a gun, uh, for show, right?

38
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.370
It's not clear that he ever actually fired a gun in what we would call combat.

39
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.650
Um, again, I could be corrected by this and I think, you know, there,

40
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.810
there are competing accounts of who he was. So he is kind of a, I mean,

41
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.730
when these figures that who sit up, the pinnacle of this world are, you know,

42
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.850
heroes that people, you know, map their aspirations onto. Right.

43
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.800
And so people like Mullo Omar who was then head of the Taliban

44
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.520
was rare, seen in public.

45
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.200
The current head of Taliban is almost never seen in public. I mean,

46
00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.120
there's kind of studied era of, um,

47
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.200
mystery that they have cultivated to make themselves available for all kinds of

48
00:03:04.201 --> 00:03:05.440
fantasies. Right. Do.

49
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.320
<v 1>You think he believed, so his religious beliefs,</v>

50
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.600
do you think he believed some of the more extreme things

51
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.110
that enable him to commit terrorist acts, maybe put another way,

52
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.390
what makes a man want to become a terrorist and what aspect of bin Laden

53
00:03:26.391 --> 00:03:28.030
made him want to be a terrorist? Right.

54
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.390
<v 0>Great. Um, I mean, lemme offer for some observations. Uh, I think, you know,</v>

55
00:03:32.391 --> 00:03:34.710
there are others who know more about bin Laden and,

56
00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.150
and have far more expertise in Al Qaeda.

57
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.700
So I'm coming this in an adjacent way,

58
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.060
kind of from El Afghanistan and from my historical training.

59
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.380
So this is my 2 cents. So, you know, bear with me. Um, I'm,

60
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.540
I don't have the authoritative account, which, which.

61
00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.540
<v 1>In itself is fascinating because your historian of Afghanistan and the fact that</v>

62
00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.330
bin Laden isn't a huge part of your focus is study just means

63
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.290
that bin Laden is not a key part of the history of Afghanistan,

64
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.890
except that America made him a key part of the history of Afghanistan.

65
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.730
<v 0>I, I would endorse that. Definitely. That's it? I mean, you,</v>

66
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.810
you put it in a very pity pity way. Um, yeah. So listen, he was, he was a,

67
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.850
so he was an engineer. He was said to be a Playboy. Um,

68
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.880
he spent a lot of cash from his family, you know,

69
00:04:22.881 --> 00:04:25.760
like many young Saudis and from some other countries,

70
00:04:25.761 --> 00:04:29.640
he was inspired by this idea that there was jihad in Afghanistan.

71
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.040
It was gonna take down one of the two superpowers, the Soviet union, who,

72
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.200
you know, the red army did murder hundreds of thousands,

73
00:04:39.201 --> 00:04:44.190
perhaps as many as 2 million in, um, African civilians during that conflict,

74
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.270
it it's very, you know, plausible and very, you know,

75
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.750
completely understandable that many young people would see that.

76
00:04:53.751 --> 00:04:55.910
Cause as you know,

77
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.870
the righteous pious fighters for jihad who called themselves,

78
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.860
Mahaine I raid against this evil empire right.

79
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.900
Of a godless Soviet empire that, I mean,

80
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.900
there was even confusion about what the Soviets wanted right now.

81
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.140
Now we know much more about like what the crim wanted, what,

82
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.020
what REEV wanted and how the Soviet elite thought about it because we have many

83
00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:18.140
more of their records, but from the outside, you know,

84
00:05:18.141 --> 00:05:20.100
for Jimmy Carter and then for Reagan,

85
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.810
it looked like the Soviets were making a move on,

86
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.490
on south Asia because they wanted to get to the warm water ports, you know,

87
00:05:28.491 --> 00:05:30.930
which Russians always want supposedly. Right. And it was kind of a,

88
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.330
a move to take over our oil and, you know, to assert world domination, right?

89
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.610
So there are lots of ways in which this looked like good evil in Congress.

90
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.360
It looked like, um, you know, kind of Vietnam again,

91
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.400
but this time this is our chance to get them.

92
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.880
And there are lots of great quotes, uh, I mean, disturbing,

93
00:05:49.881 --> 00:05:52.160
but really revealing quotes that, uh,

94
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.200
American possib America has made about wanting to give the Soviets their

95
00:05:55.201 --> 00:05:59.200
Vietnam. So the CIA funneled, you know,

96
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.480
hundreds of millions of dollars into this project to, to back the Muja,

97
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.520
you know, who Reagan called freedom fighters.

98
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.880
And so bin was part of that universe. He's part of that, you know,

99
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:12.040
he's swimming in the ocean of these Afghan Muja Dean who out of size, you know,

100
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.040
did 95% of the fighting. They're the ones who died.

101
00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:17.510
They're the ones who defeat to the red army, right?

102
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.670
The Arabs who were there did a lot of fighting, but a lot of it was for,

103
00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.470
you know, their purposes. It was to get experience.

104
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.510
It was to kind of create their reputations,

105
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.870
like bin Laden began to force for himself of being spoke in for a global

106
00:06:31.871 --> 00:06:35.630
project. Because by the late eighties, when bin Laden I think was,

107
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.700
was more active and began conspiring with people from other Arab countries,

108
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.860
the idea that, you know, go African power in 85, he's like,

109
00:06:43.861 --> 00:06:46.420
let's get out of here. This is, this is draining the Soviet budget.

110
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.220
It's an embarrassment. Uh, we didn't think about this properly.

111
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.420
Let's focus on restoring, um,

112
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.460
the party and strengthening the Soviet union. Let's get outta this cost,

113
00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.490
see war, you know, it's, it's, it's a waste. Um, it's not worth it. We,

114
00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.810
you don't lose anything by getting outta Afghanistan. Um, and so their,

115
00:07:04.811 --> 00:07:08.530
their retreat was quite, uh,

116
00:07:08.531 --> 00:07:10.650
effective and successful from the Soviet point of view, right?

117
00:07:10.651 --> 00:07:14.970
It's not what we're seeing now. Uh, what year was the retreat? Um, I mean,

118
00:07:14.971 --> 00:07:19.520
it began Wil can on to 85, you know,

119
00:07:19.521 --> 00:07:21.160
he was a generation younger than the other guys.

120
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.680
He was a critical of the system. He didn't wanna abolish it.

121
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.960
You wanted to reform it. He was a, a true believer in,

122
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.560
in Soviet socialism and in the, and the party as a, a, you know, a monopolist,

123
00:07:32.561 --> 00:07:33.880
right. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. Um,

124
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.960
but he was critical of the old guard and recognized that the party had to change

125
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.430
and, and the whole system had to change to continue to compete.

126
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.070
And so African Afghanistan was one element of this.

127
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:49.750
And so he pushed the African elites that Moscow was

128
00:07:49.751 --> 00:07:53.670
backing to basically say, listen, we're gonna share power. Um,

129
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.310
and so a figure named nudge, Ebola,

130
00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:01.820
who was a Soviet and intelligence specialists sitting in cobble,

131
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.500
um, agreed. And he said, you,

132
00:08:04.501 --> 00:08:09.220
we need to have a more kind of pluralistic accommodations approach to

133
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.900
our enemies who are backed by the us,

134
00:08:12.901 --> 00:08:17.860
mainly sitting in Pakistan, sitting in Iran, backed by his area of a two degree,

135
00:08:17.861 --> 00:08:21.090
getting money from Saudi. And he said,

136
00:08:21.091 --> 00:08:24.370
let's draw some of them into the government and basically have a,

137
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.010
a kind of unity government mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that makes some space,

138
00:08:27.011 --> 00:08:27.844
the opposition.

139
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:32.170
And for the most part with us backing with Pakistani backing,

140
00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.890
with Iranian backing and with Saudi backing, the opposition said, no,

141
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.450
we're not going to reconcile. We're gonna push you off the cliff.

142
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.240
And so that story goes on from at least 1987,

143
00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:48.680
the last Soviet red army troops leave early 1989. Um,

144
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:53.640
but the Naji Belo of government holds on for three more years. It, it is the,

145
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.760
um, I mean, they're still getting some help from the Soviet union.

146
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.040
Its enemies are still getting help from the us mainly. And, um,

147
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.880
it's not to 92 that, that, um,

148
00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.800
that they lose and then Moja come to power. They immediately,

149
00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:08.641
you know,

150
00:09:08.641 --> 00:09:12.640
they're deeply fractured and that's sort bin Laden is watching all of this

151
00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.070
unroll that's right. And he's, he's part of, HP's also mobile. So he, he,

152
00:09:16.071 --> 00:09:20.110
at one point, you know, goes, um, you know, is in Sudan, you know, he's,

153
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.150
he's moving from place to place. His people are all over the world. In fact,

154
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:28.030
they, I mean, if you think of the, once the Muja take power, you know, they,

155
00:09:28.031 --> 00:09:29.590
they have difficulties with the Arab fighters too,

156
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.390
and they don't want them coming in and, you know,

157
00:09:31.391 --> 00:09:34.590
messing with the Mogen Moja regardless as like, you know,

158
00:09:34.591 --> 00:09:37.500
this is a national state that we're gonna build, it's gonna be Islamic.

159
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:41.100
It's gonna be Islamic state, but you can't interfere with us.

160
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.420
And so there are always tensions. And so the Arabs are always kind of,

161
00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:49.180
I would say they were Arab fighters were always interlopers. Um, yes,

162
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.660
the Afghans are happy to take their money, send patients, their hospitals, um,

163
00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:54.843
take their weapons,

164
00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.170
but they were never gonna let this be like a Saudi or Egyptian or,

165
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.050
or whatever project mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. Um,

166
00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:04.650
but then many of those fighters went home. They went back to Syria.

167
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.050
They went back to Egypt. Some wanted to go back to the Saudi Arabia,

168
00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:09.370
but the Saudis very careful. I mean,

169
00:10:09.371 --> 00:10:12.610
the Saudis always used African Afghanistan as a kind of safety valve. In fact,

170
00:10:12.611 --> 00:10:15.690
they had, you know, fundraisers on television. They chartered jets,

171
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:21.040
filled them with people to fly to Pakistan, um, get out and fish shower and say,

172
00:10:21.041 --> 00:10:23.800
you know, go fight. And it was one way that the, the monarchy,

173
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:28.360
the Saudi monarchy, um, very cleverly I think created a,

174
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.880
a kind of a skate valve for, would be dissidents in Saudi Arabia. Right.

175
00:10:32.881 --> 00:10:36.400
Just send them abroad. You wanna fight jihad, go do that somewhere.

176
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.510
Don't don't bother the kingdom, but all this became dicier. Um,

177
00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:41.991
in the early nineties,

178
00:10:41.991 --> 00:10:44.950
when some of these guys came back home and some of the scholars around them

179
00:10:44.951 --> 00:10:48.150
said, you know, let's, we've defeat the Soviet, you know, which is a huge,

180
00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:48.870
huge boost.

181
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:53.830
I think part of the dynamic we see today is that the Taliban victory is a,

182
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:57.460
a renewed inspiration for people who think, look, we beat the Soviets.

183
00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.580
Now we beat the Americans. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

184
00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.900
And so already watching the Soviet retreat across this bridge,

185
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.420
back into his Pakistan. If you see these dramatic images of the, the tanks,

186
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.620
you know, moving a lot of people interpreted this as like, you know,

187
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.420
we are going to change the world.

188
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.380
And now we're turning to the Americans and our,

189
00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.500
our local national governments are backed by the Americans.

190
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.450
So this start with the start with those places, and then let's go strike,

191
00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.410
let's go strike, you know, the belly of the beast, which is America,

192
00:11:23.411 --> 00:11:26.410
which is New York. And going back to LAN you're question about, you know,

193
00:11:26.411 --> 00:11:29.650
what motivates him, what motivated him? You know, again,

194
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:33.970
he was not a rigorously trained Islamics scholar.

195
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:36.610
And that, I think, you know, when I, when this,

196
00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.480
when this comes up in our classes, you know, I think especially young people,

197
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.120
I mean, people who weren't even born around 11, I mean, they're,

198
00:11:41.121 --> 00:11:43.000
they're shocked. They, they see, they see his appearance,

199
00:11:43.001 --> 00:11:46.520
they see him pictured in front of a,

200
00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.040
a giant bookshelf mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; of Arabic books.

201
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:50.360
He's got the clash knockoff,

202
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.840
he's got what looks like a religiou scholars library behind him. Right.

203
00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.440
But if you look at his words, I mean,

204
00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.800
one fascinating thing about just our politics and just one thing that kind of

205
00:11:59.801 --> 00:12:04.800
sums all up. I mean, the fact that on nine 11, we had to have a few people,

206
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.520
a few experts, people like Bernard Ruben, who was an AF Afghanistan expert.

207
00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.280
So that was one way in which I think, you know,

208
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.830
I'm not faulting him per personally,

209
00:12:12.831 --> 00:12:16.430
but it's just one way in which that relationship appeared to be, you know,

210
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:20.870
formed right. Of linking Afghanistan to that moment. Um,

211
00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:22.910
if one looks actually, you know,

212
00:12:22.911 --> 00:12:26.190
what bin Laden was saying in doing people like Richard Clark was studying this,

213
00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.550
there were Arab leaders, the Arab press was,

214
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:32.590
was watching this because he gave some of his first interviews to, uh,

215
00:12:32.591 --> 00:12:37.140
a few newspaper outlets. But speaking of our American kind of, you know,

216
00:12:37.141 --> 00:12:40.020
monolingualism a lot of what you're saying wasn't known.

217
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.260
And so I think for several years,

218
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.820
people weren't reading what bid Laden said. I mean, experts are reading,

219
00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:51.500
reading it in Arabic, but there was great anxiety around tting his works.

220
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.060
So, you know, we have my comp,

221
00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.450
we have all this other stuff you can buy the collector works of Lynn and sta ma

222
00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:57.970
whatever you want in whatever language you want,

223
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.530
but bin was taboo for American publishing.

224
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:05.530
And so it was only a ver in the UK that published a,

225
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.530
a famous volume called messages to the world,

226
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.250
which was the first comin companion of, of Benn's writings.

227
00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:15.960
So he has a mine comp, he has a, a type, does he have a thing with, I mean,

228
00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:18.920
it's a kind of collective works. It's a collective works okay. Of his, he had,

229
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.000
he had, well, like a, like a blog. &lt;laugh&gt; like,

230
00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.040
it's a collection of articles versus yeah. These are interviews. These are his,

231
00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:30.960
his missives, his, his declarations, his, um, his decrees.

232
00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:34.830
Right. Um, which, but I think just in terms of, you know, if,

233
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:36.190
if we zoom out for a second about, you know,

234
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:38.590
American policy choices and so on the powers,

235
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:42.590
the be didn't trust us to know what he was really about. I, I put it that way.

236
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:45.110
And I don't say that in a conspiratorial sense. I just think that it was,

237
00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:50.750
you know, it, it was a taboo. And I think people, you know, there were,

238
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:54.310
it was a kind of consensus that, um, you know, trust us,

239
00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.660
we know we know how to fight Alqaeda right.

240
00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.940
And you don't need to know what they're about because they're, they're crazy.

241
00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:02.660
They're, they're fanatics, they're fundamentalists. They hate us.

242
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:07.380
Remember that language yeah. Uh, us versus them. But if you read bin Laden,

243
00:14:07.381 --> 00:14:08.220
that's when it gets messy.

244
00:14:08.221 --> 00:14:12.460
That's where the bin lad's argumentation is not fundamentally

245
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:16.490
about Islam. And if you you're sitting here with an Islamic scholar,

246
00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:20.290
he would say, you know, depending on which is Islamic scholar,

247
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.610
they would tend to go through and dissect and negate, you know,

248
00:14:24.611 --> 00:14:28.090
99% of the arguments that melon claimed was an Islam. Right.

249
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:33.410
But what strikes me as an historian? Who's again, looking at this adjacently um,

250
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:37.800
if re bin Laden, I mean, the arguments that he make are, first of all,

251
00:14:37.801 --> 00:14:40.960
they're sophisticated. They reflect a,

252
00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.040
a mind that is about geopolitics.

253
00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:48.800
He uses terms like imperialism. He knows something about world history.

254
00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:53.720
He knows something about geography. So imperialism is the enemy for him,

255
00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.600
or what's the nature of the enemy. It's a, it's a, it's an amalgam.

256
00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:00.040
And he like a good politician, which is what I would call him.

257
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:05.280
He is adept at speaking in different ways to different audiences.

258
00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.000
So if you look at the context of which he speaks,

259
00:15:08.001 --> 00:15:09.680
if you look at messages to the world,

260
00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:13.270
if you look at his writings and it would zoom out now,

261
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.190
and we now have compendia of the writings of Al Qaeda, more broadly,

262
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:21.190
you can purchase these, you know, they're basically primary source collections.

263
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:26.070
Um, we now have that for the Taliban. I mean, what's fascinating about,

264
00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:31.540
I think if you'd like this culture acknowledging it's very, you know,

265
00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:36.580
diverse internally is that these people are representatives of

266
00:15:36.581 --> 00:15:39.260
political movements who seek followers. They speak,

267
00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:44.060
they often are very, I'd say skilled at,

268
00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.540
at visual imagery. And especially now, I mean, what's fascinating is that,

269
00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.940
I mean, the Taliban, you know, used to shoot televisions, they used to,

270
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:55.730
you know, blow up, uh, VCR, um, you know, videotapes.

271
00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:56.963
Um,

272
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.690
they used to string audio and videocassettes from trees and kind of

273
00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.410
ceremonial hangings, right?

274
00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:08.330
That we we're killing this nefarious infidel technology that is

275
00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:11.890
doing the work of Satan. And yet today in PLA I mean,

276
00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.400
one of the keys to top line success is that they got really good at using media.

277
00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.680
I mean, brilliant at using, uh, the written word,

278
00:16:19.681 --> 00:16:24.480
the spoken word music actually. Um, and you know, Hollywood,

279
00:16:24.481 --> 00:16:28.800
Hollywood is the gold standard. And these guys have studied how to create drama,

280
00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:33.030
how to speak to modern users. I mean, Islamic state did this mean the,

281
00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:35.390
the role of media, new media? I mean,

282
00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:40.630
I am I follow and I am followed by senior Toban leaders, which is,

283
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.710
you know, bizarre, you know, on Twitter, on, on Twitter.

284
00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:48.950
I don't know why they care about me. I'm, I'm nothing, uh, they, they follow,

285
00:16:48.951 --> 00:16:52.230
they follow you on Twitter. I don't know why this is no joke. This is no joke.

286
00:16:52.231 --> 00:16:53.060
So it's,

287
00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.940
they're part of our modern world and how they talk and it's how they recruit.

288
00:16:55.941 --> 00:16:59.100
And this is part of the, this is why they are, you know, so, so Ben Laden,

289
00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:02.460
if you bin Laden, he, he speaks multiple languages. I would say it's, uh,

290
00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.940
it's environmentalism. You know,

291
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.300
the west is bad because we destroyed the planet.

292
00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:13.340
The west is bad because we abuse women. So in, in class, you know,

293
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:14.851
uh, especially, you know,

294
00:17:14.851 --> 00:17:18.610
female students are very surprised to learn and actually say, you know, this,

295
00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:23.530
this feminist argument is not, you know, we start with,

296
00:17:23.531 --> 00:17:26.650
you know, this is a murder. This is a person who has taken human life,

297
00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:30.930
innocent life over and over again. And he is, um, you know,

298
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:34.920
aspirationally genocidal, but to understand what he's about.

299
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.680
So we walk through the texts, read them,

300
00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:41.080
and people are shocked to learn that it's not just about,

301
00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.880
you know, quotations in the Qurans thrown together in some irrational fashion.

302
00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.480
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; he knows. Um, I mean, at the core,

303
00:17:48.481 --> 00:17:52.200
I'd say is the problem of human suffering. And he has a geography of that.

304
00:17:52.201 --> 00:17:55.440
That is mostly Muslim, but he talked about the suffering of cashmere, right.

305
00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:56.480
So if you have a student in your class,

306
00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:00.800
who's from south Asia who knows about Kashmere, you know, he, or she will say,

307
00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.000
that's not entirely inaccurate, you know? Yeah.

308
00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:08.830
Indian state commits the trustees in Kashmere. Uh, you know,

309
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:12.630
Pakistan is even that too, you know, Palestine is an issue, right?

310
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:17.150
So you have in the American university setting people across the spectrum who

311
00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:20.310
get that, you know, Palestinians have had a raw deal.

312
00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:23.230
And so it's a victimhood is, is central.

313
00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.830
And it's Muslim victimhood, which is primary,

314
00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:30.660
but as numbers scholars have have written, and I'm, you know,

315
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.900
I definitely think this is a, a framework for what this's useful. I mean,

316
00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.940
in this kind of vocabulary in this, in this framing, in this narrative, um,

317
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:40.220
today in today's world,

318
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:45.220
if we think of today's world being post called war 91 to the present,

319
00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:50.890
looking at the series of Gulf wars and seeing the visuals of that, I think that,

320
00:18:50.891 --> 00:18:53.050
you know, I think the American public has been shielded for some of this.

321
00:18:53.051 --> 00:18:53.970
But if you look at, you know, as the,

322
00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:58.890
the carnage of the Iraqi army that

323
00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:02.650
George HW Bush produced, right, or you think of, you know, the,

324
00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:07.490
the images of the suffering of Iraqi children under George

325
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:09.330
HW, Bush's sanctions us British,

326
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:15.440
then you have mad Albright answer a question on 60 minutes saying, do you think,

327
00:19:15.441 --> 00:19:19.280
you know, the deaths of half a million Iraq kids is, is worth it,

328
00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.520
you is that justified to contain Sam MUE. And she says on camera, yes,

329
00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:28.200
that it's worth it to me. If you put that all together, I mean, American kids.

330
00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:31.390
And of course the American public, they're not always aware of those,

331
00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:35.230
those facts of global history, but these guys are, and they,

332
00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.750
they very capably use these images,

333
00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:42.150
use these tropes and use facts. I mean, the fact, I mean, some,

334
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.710
these things are not, are notable. I mean, the, the, I mean,

335
00:19:44.711 --> 00:19:48.070
these estimate about the number of Iraqi, civilian children dead, you know,

336
00:19:48.071 --> 00:19:50.910
that, that came from, I think the Lance and it came from, you know, those,

337
00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:55.460
those are estimates, but looking at point point of view, of, of, of Amman,

338
00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.180
of, you know, JFA of Nairobi, you know,

339
00:20:00.181 --> 00:20:02.340
just think around the planet. Um,

340
00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:07.420
and if you see yourself as the victim of this great Imperial power, you know,

341
00:20:07.421 --> 00:20:12.170
you can see why especially young men would be drawn to, uh, Arod of, of,

342
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:17.850
of self-sacrifice. And the idea is that in,

343
00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:18.783
in killing others,

344
00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:24.410
you are making them feel how you feel. Yeah.

345
00:20:24.411 --> 00:20:27.490
Because they won't listen to your arguments reasonably because they won't,

346
00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:31.530
you know, recognize Palestinian suffering bosy and suffering, right.

347
00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:34.800
To suffering. You go across the planet, right.

348
00:20:34.801 --> 00:20:36.800
Because they won't recognize our suffering.

349
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:40.640
We're gonna speak to you in the only language that you understand and that's

350
00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:45.720
violence, and look at the violence of, of the post 19 one world, right.

351
00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:50.280
In which American air power really becomes a global, you know,

352
00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:54.120
kind of fact, in the lives of so many people. Um,

353
00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:57.200
and then the big mistake after nine 11, among many, I mean,

354
00:20:57.201 --> 00:21:01.280
fundamentally was taking the terror to some, you know,

355
00:21:01.281 --> 00:21:02.520
30 or 40 countries. Right.

356
00:21:02.521 --> 00:21:06.990
So that you have a more and more of the globe feel you like they're under

357
00:21:06.991 --> 00:21:10.270
attack. Right. And the, and the logic is essentially, it's not, it's not,

358
00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:15.030
it's Reid Laden. It's not, we're going to convert you and turn you into Muslims.

359
00:21:15.031 --> 00:21:17.270
And that's why we're doing this. That, that appears,

360
00:21:17.271 --> 00:21:20.070
that claim does appear at times. But it's,

361
00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:22.830
if you look at any given bin Laden text, I mean,

362
00:21:22.831 --> 00:21:26.350
there are 40 claims in each text. I mean, it's kind of, it's dizzying,

363
00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:29.700
but he's a modern politician. He knows the language of,

364
00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.180
of social equality. You know, that there's a class dimension to it.

365
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:37.420
There is an environmental dimension to it. There's a gender dimension to it.

366
00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.900
And yes, there are chronic quotes sprinkled in.

367
00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.300
And when he wants to speak that language, he knew that, you know,

368
00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:46.203
he's not a scholar.

369
00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:50.730
So he would often get a few recognized scholars to sign on.

370
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:55.970
So some of his decorations of jihad had his signature kind of sprinkled in

371
00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.290
with like a dozen other,

372
00:21:57.291 --> 00:22:01.130
other signatures from people who were somewhat known or at least, you know,

373
00:22:01.131 --> 00:22:05.530
with titles. Right. Um, so as a kind of intellectual exercise,

374
00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:10.360
it's fascinating to see that he is throwing everything, the wall at one level.

375
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.080
Um, that's one way to see that it's a, it's a,

376
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:18.080
these are kind of testaments toward recruitment of people who

377
00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:22.200
yes, they're angry. Yes. They're unhappy. And this is what, you know,

378
00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:25.360
I think for our broader public, it's hard to get. You're like, well,

379
00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.550
bin LA didn't suffer. He wasn't poor. Like, yeah. I mean,

380
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:33.230
linen P pot. I mean, they're.

381
00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:36.110
<v 1>Speaking to, they're empathetic to the suffering, the landscape,</v>

382
00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:39.990
the full landscape of suffering. It's interesting to, to think about suffering,

383
00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:45.910
you know, America, the American public American politicians and leaders,

384
00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.740
when they see what is good and evil,

385
00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:53.660
they're often not empathetic to the suffering of others.

386
00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:57.140
And what you're saying has bin Laden,

387
00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:02.300
perhaps accurately could speak to the ignorance of America,

388
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:05.140
maybe the Soviet union to the suffering of their people.
