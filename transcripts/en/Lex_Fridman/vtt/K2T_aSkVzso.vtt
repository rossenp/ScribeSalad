00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.410
<v 0>What, um, maybe you could speak to love and relationship in your own life.</v>

2
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.330
But in general, if we look at Alice shrug,

3
00:00:10.331 --> 00:00:15.170
if we look at fountain head and maybe this is going to become a therapy session

4
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.410
for L but also just looking at your own life in a form of advice. Sure.

5
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.290
How can you be, uh,

6
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.840
O'Rourke and type character and do it live your life to the fullest

7
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.953
in, in,

8
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.480
in creating the most amazing things that you're able to create and yet have

9
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.560
others in your life that you give yourself to in terms

10
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.080
of loving them fully and having a family, having kids,

11
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.670
but just even just the love of your life kind of thing. Um,

12
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.310
how do you balance those things together? Is there any, anything to say.

13
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.470
<v 1>I'll say one thing, cuz then I'll defer to your own.</v>

14
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.430
Cuz he's the one who's married here. &lt;laugh&gt; I, I don't think it's a balance.

15
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.470
I think they've compliment each other and feed off each other. So it's like,

16
00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:02.550
how do you balance having shoes and pants? It's like, no, you want both, you,

17
00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:03.384
you want it all. And,

18
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.060
and having a great partner who thinks you're a badass and then sometimes they're

19
00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:08.900
on the stage and you're like,

20
00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:11.660
oh my I'm married to a badass that's that's the goal. Yeah.

21
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.340
<v 2>Am I wrong? No, absolutely. It feeds off of each other. It's it's synergetic.</v>

22
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.220
It's completely synergetic. The, the problem that people have, I think the,

23
00:01:19.221 --> 00:01:23.020
where they get into challenges is when they view them as opposites, right? Yeah.

24
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.130
Work or family all, if you don't work the family,

25
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.010
you can't fund finance the family. But more than that, why is your love gonna,

26
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.970
why is your wife gonna love you? Right?

27
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.890
What are the virtues that you you're bringing?

28
00:01:35.891 --> 00:01:37.850
If you don't maximize your own potential,

29
00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:40.770
if you don't live the best life that you can live, what is it to love?

30
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.810
And if she doesn't do the same thing, why do you love her? So,

31
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.080
so you don't get this conflict between work and you know,

32
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.720
how do I have a balanced life? Of course you have a balanced life.

33
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.600
You balance it based on your values. And it's never gonna be the same.

34
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.160
The balance is, you know, the,

35
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.400
the time you spend at work and with family when you're young or when you have

36
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.320
little kids or when they're grown up is all gonna be different.

37
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.710
It's gonna depend on are priorities at the point, but it's all gonna feed.

38
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.550
<v 0>Off of each other. So maybe another word outside of balance is sacrifice.</v>

39
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.470
Do you think relationship involves sacrifice or enough? She know.

40
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.710
<v 1>What he's doing. I know he's I he's trolling. You he's troll. He's trolling.</v>

41
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.630
You he's a big troll Lexus. The biggest troll on Twitter ever,

42
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.750
Ever S deal with it.

43
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.630
<v 0>Never sacrificed.</v>

44
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.860
<v 1>Mean sacrifice in the I know. So.</v>

45
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.580
<v 2>I'm gonna define so yeah. Okay. So sacrifice in my.</v>

46
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.860
<v 1>Role. Can, can I say one thing before we go, we get sidebar.</v>

47
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.740
Rand ran had a good example of what you're talking about balance.

48
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.460
So she was married to this guy, Fran O'Connor. He was not a cerebral.

49
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.340
He was not intellectual. That's fine. She was in love with him.

50
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.220
And I met someone who had been friends with Rand.

51
00:02:43.221 --> 00:02:46.100
And a lot of times she'd have these conversations with her acolytes to like four

52
00:02:46.101 --> 00:02:48.730
the morning, but at the most cerebral topics. And I said,

53
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:49.930
and he would always bring them food.

54
00:02:49.931 --> 00:02:52.690
He'd stay up and kind of sit there in a corner. And I go,

55
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.010
when this was happening, was he sitting there like, oh God,

56
00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:58.690
here goes crazy old iron. And I just gotta be bored. And they go,

57
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.640
absolutely not. He was, he was so proud of her. He was so excited.

58
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.560
In fact, when she got a lot of money from, I think selling, uh, red pond,

59
00:03:07.561 --> 00:03:09.080
which was her screenplay, which never produced,

60
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.640
he told her you can buy any kind of fur coat, as long as it's mink, he would,

61
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.920
he's like you earn this, celebrate it. So that was a good example. And that's a.

62
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.070
<v 2>Good relationship. Absolutely.</v>

63
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.350
Now sacrifice is the GI is the giving of a high of a value and expecting either

64
00:03:24.351 --> 00:03:29.230
nothing or something less in return. You don't do that in a love relationship.

65
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.750
Your love relationship is a sense, a, a trade you're constantly trading.

66
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:37.750
You're not trading materially, but you're trading spiritually.

67
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.900
You imagine if I only gave my wife, if I gave spiritually immaturely,

68
00:03:42.901 --> 00:03:46.700
only in one direction, I get sick of it. She gets sick of it.

69
00:03:46.701 --> 00:03:51.220
It would never last. It has to be in give and take constantly in different ways.

70
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.940
Right? Different values. It's not, it's not a monetary exchange,

71
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.180
but it's constantly, you're giving in your, you receiving and you're giving,

72
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.290
right. And it's, it's, it's gotta, that's gotta be in balance. And,

73
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.010
and I know a lot of relationship where that gets outta bound, right?

74
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.410
And one party feels like they're giving all the time,

75
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.410
the sacrificing they're giving more than they're receiving in a sense.

76
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.850
And it's over. Right? So now people use the word sacrifice like,

77
00:04:17.851 --> 00:04:20.840
like Jordan Peterson, sometimes you, he uses a, it both ways, right?

78
00:04:20.841 --> 00:04:23.520
That's the problem. People use it. Jordan. I don't know him personally.

79
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.480
No Jordan Peterson. I said, I didn't call him. Jordan. Say, just wanna be clear.

80
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.360
Yeah. Uh, he uses in his talks as sometimes he uses it as,

81
00:04:30.361 --> 00:04:33.080
just as I described it. Uh, and he's supportive of that.

82
00:04:33.081 --> 00:04:36.600
Like the sacrifice Jesus made, right. And sometimes he uses as his investment,

83
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.200
but it's, it's not, if you're, if you're giving,

84
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.430
giving money now expecting a bigger return in the future,

85
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.390
that's not a sacrifice. That's an investment.

86
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.150
That's why we have two concepts for that. And the same is true. You know,

87
00:04:49.151 --> 00:04:52.110
if my wife is ill and I'm in, you know,

88
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.910
I've got a whole relationship build around what I'm giving.

89
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.670
It's not that I'm not getting anything back when I'm getting back is that she is

90
00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:02.300
recovering, right. Is that she is,

91
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.460
she's still alive or whatever it is that that I'm keeping.

92
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.780
That's the value that I'm getting in return. If I'm not getting that,

93
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.820
why am I doing it? Cuz I signed a contract a long time ago. Um,

94
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.700
so it's uh, it's, it's not a sacrifice.

95
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.540
Children are not sacrifice if I don't go to the movies cuz I stay with my home

96
00:05:19.541 --> 00:05:23.530
with my kids. It's because I love my kids more than I love going to the movies.

97
00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:24.310
Right.

98
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.690
And if I love going to the movies more than I love staying with the kids and get

99
00:05:27.691 --> 00:05:31.370
a babysitter or don't have kids, which is the better, better.

100
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.890
<v 1>Approach's good question. Yeah. Who did,</v>

101
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.010
what book did IRAD say is the most evil book in all serious literature and it

102
00:05:38.011 --> 00:05:40.450
was a Quin and the reason it was that book,

103
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:42.560
which I haven't read that's please correct me. If I plot wrong.

104
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.800
Rand was saying is the plot is a guy who's a big shot.

105
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.720
I think he marries a stupid girl who has nothing of value to offer him for at

106
00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:52.360
all. And she ends up killing herself, whereas Rand's version.

107
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.120
And we could take this out of the romantic context. It,

108
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.360
I am delighted when I could be of use to my friends. It is,

109
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.600
makes me feel wonderful and not in a kind of parasitic way. It's just like that.

110
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.040
I'm at a certain point where they call me up,

111
00:06:06.041 --> 00:06:08.240
they're having a problem and I've helped them with that problem. And.

112
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.280
<v 2>A cor he gives up the love of his life. Oh how,</v>

113
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.990
what it is the amazing goal. He has an affair with the outside of marriage.

114
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.550
Taints. Her is married to the, to the stupid,

115
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.670
but she gives him the prestige and everything.

116
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.470
<v 1>Oh, oh that's clearly very anti Randy.</v>

117
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.350
<v 2>Yeah, yeah, yeah. And, and the, and the, the, the, the, the, the, the smart,</v>

118
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.070
real, the one he, he loves, she commits suicide in there. Oh, okay.

119
00:06:32.071 --> 00:06:36.910
I got it wrong. So it's, it's it's um, it's, it's about him. True.

120
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.180
Cru mediocrity and nothingness over this over love. So,

121
00:06:42.181 --> 00:06:46.420
so pursuing your values is so crucial. So, so don't sacrifice.

122
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.140
It doesn't mean that if you want to eat Chinese and she want to eat Italian,

123
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.420
you don't once in a while, eat Italian on that day. Right's little that's.

124
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.460
<v 1>That's just.</v>

125
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.420
<v 2>Get little that's silly, right? That's not a sacrifice, not an,</v>

126
00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.210
a sense in what we're talking about. That's, you know,

127
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.450
it doesn't mean don't compromise. It doesn't mean don't compromise on,

128
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:06.650
on the day to day stuff. It means don't compromise a moral of values.

129
00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.730
Doesn't you don't compromise on the big stuff and you never, and, and,

130
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.570
and you never sacrifice. And that way you,

131
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:16.650
you have a relationship that's built as equals and,

132
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:17.843
and as you,

133
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.560
my each other and love at the end of the day is a response to value.

134
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.000
If you stop undermining your own value,

135
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.060
the person who loves you will stop or will stop loving. You will love you less.

136
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.780
If you love yourself less, they, you know, you have to, I, I also said just,

137
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.650
you know, to say, I love you. You have to be able to say the I, right.

138
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:43.090
You have to, you have to be somebody. You have to know yourself.

139
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:48.010
You have to have value. Uh, and, and so love is a love is a profound,

140
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.090
emotional response to value.
