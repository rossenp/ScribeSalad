00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.720
<v 0>Well, let me ask you for some advice you've been through one heck of a career,</v>

2
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.240
one heck of a life. What advice would you give to a young person today?

3
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.840
<v 1>Well, in wrestling, I, I,</v>

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.040
I think wrestling's really a microcosm of what your life's gonna be.

5
00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:19.120
And that's why one of the things that I stress the kids is like,

6
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.320
if we can go through this now and you figure, I, I, I've a couple kids,

7
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:25.190
you're struggling certain, if you can figure it out this now in wrestling,

8
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:26.671
it's gonna be a lot better.

9
00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:31.150
Figure it out now and get over this mental hump than when you're 32 and you have

10
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.830
two kids and right. And your job's not going well, it's gonna be a lot worse.

11
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.550
It's gonna be a lot more painful then let's, let's figure it out now.

12
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.590
So a lot of these things, a lot of these lessons we can learn from wrestling,

13
00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:44.580
whether it's persistence or perseverance or work ethic, or, you know, I said,

14
00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:47.340
wrestles show up on time and they work hard, right? These things,

15
00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:49.060
if we can learn these things at an early age,

16
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.620
those are gen those characteristic characteristics will generally carry on

17
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:53.980
throughout our life.

18
00:00:53.981 --> 00:00:56.740
And those are the things that are gonna make us really successful. So, um,

19
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.620
you know,

20
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.580
I would say finding great coach someone who's gonna spend a lot of time and put

21
00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:03.980
a lot of time into you and make sure they have a lot of wisdom and steal all the

22
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.250
wisdom that you can from them.

23
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.410
<v 2>And then though, if you can be successful at one thing, generally,</v>

24
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.570
whatever that recipe was that took you to be successful with that,

25
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.970
apply it to everything else, right. Apply it to the rest of your life,

26
00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:20.450
apply it to, uh, getting a wife that you enjoy, uh, apply it to, uh,

27
00:01:20.451 --> 00:01:23.650
living in a place you wanna live doing a job you want to do right there.

28
00:01:23.651 --> 00:01:25.920
There's so many possibilities and,

29
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.400
and you just have to be bold enough to go take those chances.

30
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.720
<v 0>It's interesting, cuz like early on in life is when you have much more time.</v>

31
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.560
Like people don't realize this time to learn the lessons.

32
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.200
Like somehow later in life you get busier responsibilities and all that kind of

33
00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:44.760
stuff. Like high school's a magical time in college, like college. Yeah,

34
00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:49.630
for sure. Yeah. There's so much time. &lt;laugh&gt; right. Learn. Well, you didn't.

35
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.270
<v 1>Have kids yet. Yeah. I don't have kids.</v>

36
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.990
<v 0>Cause it still fills up. Well,</v>

37
00:01:52.991 --> 00:01:56.950
no I on purpose and I did something that many people don't seem to be able to

38
00:01:56.951 --> 00:02:01.550
do. I walked away from a lot of responsibilities. Just how by saying goodbye.

39
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.990
Oh, okay. By like, but you know, meetings like there,

40
00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:09.660
everybody on me at MIT was like meetings fill the day and then you have

41
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.620
more projects and you do a great job and you become successful.

42
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.780
And then the more meetings fill the day and more responsibilities as opposed to

43
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.020
like, wait a minute, do I want to be involved in all these things? Uh,

44
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.180
and instead,

45
00:02:23.181 --> 00:02:27.490
do I want to find one or two things to re really focus on and

46
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.730
that's what I choose. But like yeah, that becomes harder and harder and harder.

47
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:33.683
You get older.

48
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.810
<v 1>No. What I mean? I'm sure. And, and, and also the more success you have,</v>

49
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:40.330
you become sought after other places. Yeah, too. I'm I'm sure that's happening.

50
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.290
<v 0>With you. And it's hard to say, keep saying no, no, no. Saying those hard.</v>

51
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:45.250
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah.</v>
