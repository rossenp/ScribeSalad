00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.960
<v 0>Just another person that seems to be a key figure in this,</v>

2
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.780
in the mythology of this is Bob Lasar. It'd be interesting.

3
00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:17.250
Maybe there's others you can tell me about, but, um, uh, Bob,

4
00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:18.510
who's also been on Joe Rogan,

5
00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:22.720
but his story has been told quite a bit and he's got the, I,

6
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.970
I think he said that he witnessed some

7
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.020
of the work being done, uh,

8
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.220
on the spacecraft that was in, you know,

9
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.460
that was captured. And so on in order to, uh,

10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.340
try to reverse engineer some of the technology in terms of the propulsion.

11
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.970
And so what are your thoughts about his story,

12
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.040
how it fits into the mythology of this whole thing and a broader you

13
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.990
follow just you follow just community.

14
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:52.641
<v 1>Okay.</v>

15
00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:57.530
So regarding Bob was R with respect to his claims.

16
00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.593
Um, again,

17
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.210
I have no way to adjudicate whether or not he actually,

18
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.950
you know, encountered this. I do have friends who are,

19
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.570
and the people that I know who

20
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.280
know his story, some know him, um, believe him.

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.890
And they have said to me that the most important thing that

22
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.180
they think he has said, in fact, one of them, I think, made a,

23
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.520
made a meme out of it or something like that was basically, he said,

24
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.590
uh, maybe the public, you know, I regret making it public.

25
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.050
Maybe the public isn't ready for this kind of information.

26
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.070
And basically they've, they emphasize that to me.

27
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.840
And they emphasized it so much that they wanted me to know. Right.

28
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.910
So that is somewhat creepy to me. So I think, okay,

29
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.200
this port guy, Bob was, are so many people, you know,

30
00:02:00.201 --> 00:02:04.130
this is what happens to people who have experiences like this they're

31
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.030
questioned, their reputations are put on the line.

32
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.000
In some instances they're,

33
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.890
their reputations are manipulated on purpose to make them look on credible.

34
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.610
<v 0>To me as I'm a scientist,</v>

35
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.500
it's just inspiring that it kind of gives this kind of,

36
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.960
I'm not even thinking of,

37
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.250
is there an actual spacecraft being hidden somewhere and studied and so on.

38
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.530
I'm thinking of it. Like, I dunno,

39
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.770
it's a thing that gives you a spark of a dream, you know, to,

40
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.020
as a reminder,

41
00:02:39.021 --> 00:02:43.580
that we don't understand most of how this world works.

42
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.010
And then we can build technologies that aren't here today that will

43
00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:51.890
allow us to understand much more. And then it's kind of like,

44
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.720
almost like a feeling that it provides, uh, it inspires and makes you dream.

45
00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.310
That's that's the way I see the Bible as our story. I necessarily.

46
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.810
<v 2>People ask me, cause I'm at MIT,</v>

47
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:06.130
people ask me like the Bibles are actually good at MIT and so on. I don't know.

48
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:09.970
And I personally don't care. Like it's a, that's not,

49
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:12.910
what's interesting to me about that story. To me,

50
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:16.810
the myth is more interesting. Not interesting actually,

51
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:21.490
but inspiring because inspiring you're suggesting that the myth

52
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:26.170
inspires you to create reality. Yes. Yeah. I think that's, that's true.

53
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.690
So even if it's like, not real,

54
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.080
in some sense, just like you said, it does in some sense it, uh,

55
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.100
it doesn't.
