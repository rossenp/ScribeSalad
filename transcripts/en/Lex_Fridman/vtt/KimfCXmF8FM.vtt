00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.190
<v 0>I've spoken with David Fravor on this podcast. I really like him as a person.</v>

2
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.540
He's a fun guy, but also he's gotten the chance to, um,

3
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.810
he's described as the account of having experience with, uh,

4
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.340
what he and others now term the tic-tac UFO. Uh,

5
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.200
what do you think of that particular citing,

6
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:25.440
which has captivated the imagination of many in particular,

7
00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:29.910
because there's been videos released of it, of these UFO's,

8
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.860
but I find the videos to be way too blurry and grainy to be of

9
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.130
interest to me, the personally, uh, to me,

10
00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:42.930
the most fascinating thing is the first person to come up from David and

11
00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:46.500
others about that experience. But w what are your thoughts?

12
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.360
<v 1>Those videos have been out for a while, actually much, I think,</v>

13
00:00:50.361 --> 00:00:52.640
in the mid two thousands, they were out.

14
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.830
But what you have is you have kind of like this corroboration from a

15
00:00:57.831 --> 00:01:01.970
group, and also the New York times involvement in 2017.

16
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.030
My opinion about the tic-tacs is that, um,

17
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.890
first I believe the people who have had the experiences, I know some of them,

18
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.740
like, you know, some of the radar people and things like that,

19
00:01:12.741 --> 00:01:17.000
they'd saw them and they're not, I don't believe they're making it up. Okay. Um,

20
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.560
I do think that this is being, this is being used, uh,

21
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.340
as a spin. Okay. And I'm just going to say that. And the reason I think that is,

22
00:01:25.341 --> 00:01:27.770
this is because at the time it was released,

23
00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:32.300
I was still in touch with many people who were among the UFO fight club.

24
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.240
And so they had intimate knowledge of these things.

25
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.420
And the first thing they said was, um,

26
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.650
we have satellites that can read the news on your phone when you're reading it.

27
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.900
So we've got better footage than this, and this is not good footage at all.

28
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.160
Therefore they believe that it was authentic footage that had been doctored up

29
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.720
now why? I don't know why. Um,

30
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.170
so I, so I honestly don't know if it's accurate or not. I mean,

31
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.970
I believe the people absolutely.

32
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.830
But was this something out there to fool these people, perhaps?

33
00:02:06.831 --> 00:02:09.680
I don't know. Um, is it spun? Um,

34
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.580
the people who I know who are part of the UFO fight club believed it was real.

35
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.600
Okay. And said, this is badly done, but real. Okay.

36
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.180
<v 0>I see. So there's some kind of, when you say spinning,</v>

37
00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:24.680
there's some parties involved that are trying to leverage it from the,

38
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.700
for funds profitably for funds and financial insurance. I think so.

39
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.100
Nevertheless, it hasn't,

40
00:02:31.101 --> 00:02:35.330
spired a conversation and just a lot of

41
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.140
people in the world that, um,

42
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.620
there's something mysterious out there that, uh,

43
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.600
we're not fully informed about.

44
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.920
<v 1>And I was certainly grateful that the New York times ran the story right before</v>

45
00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:49.754
my book came out.

46
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.540
<v 0>We'll see. But there's the financial interest that, to me,</v>

47
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.950
as a person who doesn't give a about money, actually, I don't like money,

48
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.830
uh, is, um, except for one it's used in the,

49
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:07.750
in the context of a company to build cool things. But like personally, I dunno,

50
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:11.500
I find the financial interesting, uh, side off-putting,

51
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.480
um, especially when we're talking about the exploration of some of the most like

52
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.210
money is a silly creation of human beings.

53
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.740
<v 1>I agree.</v>

54
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.570
<v 0>And it's, it's a used to provide a temporary,</v>

55
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.160
like the unfortunate thing with money is that it, um,

56
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.170
helps you buy things that too easily allow you to

57
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:38.680
forget the important things in life.

58
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.910
And also to forget the difficult aspects of life to do the difficult

59
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:45.700
intellectual work of being cognizant of your mortality,

60
00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:50.620
of like fully engaging in life in a

61
00:03:50.621 --> 00:03:53.710
life of reason, too, of thinking deeply about the world,

62
00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:57.100
all those kinds of things. If you get like a nice car or something like that,

63
00:03:57.101 --> 00:03:58.990
and just like, I dunno,

64
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.710
all the different things you can do with money is it can make you forget that

65
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.030
anyway, as a there's a long way to say that. Yes. Yes.

66
00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:11.770
It's very nice that it coincided nicely with the book, but also it,

67
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.730
uh, I think it, I mean, like I said,

68
00:04:15.731 --> 00:04:18.280
I think it inspired quite a lot of people that, you know,

69
00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:21.460
maybe there's a lot of things out there that were like,

70
00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:24.370
it reminded a lot of people there's things out there we don't know about.

71
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.520
<v 1>Lex. I can agree with you on that, but can I push back on two things? Okay.</v>

72
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.570
All right.

73
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.250
The first one is that I was happy to receive money from the book because of the

74
00:04:35.251 --> 00:04:37.410
New York times article. That's absolutely false.

75
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.010
So I published my book with Oxford, which is an academic press,

76
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.050
and you don't get paid with an academic press. Okay. So money was not it for me,

77
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.940
what it was, was recognition that my research was being validated. So, you know,

78
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.780
cause then people called me and said, well, maybe it's more than interesting.

79
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.260
Okay. And they did. Okay. The other thing about money is just,

80
00:04:58.261 --> 00:05:03.210
as you say that ma now I agree with you there I'm

81
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.840
upset about money too. I think there should be universal healthcare,

82
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.410
a universal income, all, you know, I don't think people should be in poverty,

83
00:05:10.411 --> 00:05:14.970
especially because we are so wealthy as a species, frankly. Um, okay.

84
00:05:14.971 --> 00:05:18.690
That said, think about this. If you are,

85
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.980
if you don't have money, you can't have a life of the mind either. Right.

86
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.520
<v 0>100%. So I'm not espousing that like money's the devil.</v>

87
00:05:26.521 --> 00:05:30.600
I just think that there is money can be, um,

88
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.450
a drug or I will compare it to like food or something like that,

89
00:05:36.451 --> 00:05:41.190
where like, you really should have enough to nourish yourself. Right.

90
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.630
And, uh, too much and too much can be a huge problem. Uh,

91
00:05:45.631 --> 00:05:49.290
so that, that, that's where I come from with the money. And I'm just, uh, aware,

92
00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:53.760
I'm fortunate enough to have the skills and the health to be able to earn a

93
00:05:53.761 --> 00:05:56.310
living in whatever way. Uh,

94
00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.630
like I wish I'm being in the United States of being able to speak English.

95
00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:03.800
So the very least I could work at McDonald's and my standards are,

96
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.810
I told Joe, I mean, mistake,

97
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:11.870
I told Joe Rogan that I've always had a few money and people are like,

98
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.490
Oh, Lex was always re no, no, no, no. I was always broke. What I mean by,

99
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.510
uh,

100
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:22.490
I've always had F-you money as my standard or what it takes to have a few.

101
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.510
Is those very little, I'm just happy with, with very little, but yes,

102
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:27.950
it's true that, uh,

103
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.910
money for many people and including for myself,

104
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.000
it's just a different level for different people is freedom,

105
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.650
freedom to think freedom to do, to pursue your passions.

106
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.600
It just so happens.

107
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.940
I am very fortunate that many of my passions often come with a salary if

108
00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:51.740
I wished right. So everything like me, I love programming.

109
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:56.690
So even just like working as a like basic level software engineer will

110
00:06:56.691 --> 00:07:00.020
be a source of a lot of joy for me. And that happens in this modern,

111
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.060
modern world to come with a salary. So yeah, it's definitely true.

112
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.180
I just mean that it's, it can be, become a dangerous dress. So I'm glad,

113
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:13.400
I'm glad you are in this pursuit that you are in for the love of

114
00:07:13.401 --> 00:07:17.720
knowledge and, um, but it's true. Yeah.

115
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.250
People should definitely buy your book. Won't be making money off of it.

116
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.960
Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely. My next book. Yes.

117
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:33.170
Yeah. Your son says there's some thing as there's some

118
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:39.440
groups of people that may be trying to leverage this

119
00:07:39.441 --> 00:07:41.090
for financial gains.

120
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:45.550
<v 1>No, probably good financial. I mean, they may have good reasons for this too.</v>

121
00:07:45.551 --> 00:07:48.430
Like, okay, let's take the study of UFO's. Okay.

122
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:53.200
Maybe many people in government that decide who Dole out the money.

123
00:07:53.201 --> 00:07:56.170
Let's put it that way. They think UFO's, aren't real.

124
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.600
So they're not going to give these programs money.

125
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.480
So how do these programs make money? Um,

126
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:05.230
they're going to have to find a way to do it. So maybe that's how they do it.

127
00:08:05.231 --> 00:08:06.064
Okay. So.

128
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.300
<v 0>That's fascinating. This is a way to raise money for, for.</v>
