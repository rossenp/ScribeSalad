1
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.870
<v 0>Can you talk about what is the idea of succession?</v>

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.110
What are the odds that it might happen?

3
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.860
What does it mean for the United States? Uh,

4
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.080
in some way for different States to succeed?

5
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.430
<v 1>Sure. America has been one country with several cultures since the beginning.</v>

6
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.420
Um,

7
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.710
there's absolutely no reason for someone this goes back to the anarchist idea.

8
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.590
If you despise Donald Trump, which is your prerogative,

9
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.010
if you think Joe Biden is a clown, which is your prerogative,

10
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.140
there's absolutely no reason for you to be governed by someone you disapprove of

11
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.050
this is a incoherent nonsensical concept.

12
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.440
The only reason we even take it as a hypothesis is that we're trained to the

13
00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:45.590
contrary since kindergarten, um, uh, succession.

14
00:00:45.591 --> 00:00:47.510
I don't know what along what lines,

15
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.580
but increasingly it's becoming harder and harder for people to have

16
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.770
conversations. I think social media,

17
00:00:54.771 --> 00:00:57.410
and this is something people despise social media for.

18
00:00:57.411 --> 00:00:59.560
I think this is something that social media has done well,

19
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.190
which I am advocating for is it tends to kind of run through

20
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.550
ideas through like an evolutionary process and drive them to the logical

21
00:01:07.551 --> 00:01:10.370
conclusion. Uh, so it's very hard to be a moderate online,

22
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.720
cause there's gonna be people, you know,

23
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.690
pushing through your ideas through several cycles and then you're gonna end up

24
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.250
at some kind of more pure, or if you want to dislike it extreme perspective,

25
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.260
having these different pockets,

26
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.730
it's not really governable because people fundamentally have different

27
00:01:25.731 --> 00:01:28.970
worldviews. So I don't know what's the session would look like.

28
00:01:28.971 --> 00:01:31.250
I think the number is really

29
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.100
increasing at an exponential rate. Um, I do not number of supporters,

30
00:01:37.101 --> 00:01:37.934
supporters.

31
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.260
I think the claim that this can only be accomplished through violence is false.

32
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.640
It's a lie. Uh,

33
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.850
just like any divorce doesn't have to involve beating your ex-husband or

34
00:01:46.851 --> 00:01:49.700
ex-wife. So, and I,

35
00:01:49.701 --> 00:01:54.530
I I'm very much looking forward to this becoming a reality far

36
00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:55.790
quicker than I ever expected.

37
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.480
<v 0>Well, do you think there's a value of, um,</v>

38
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.580
competing,

39
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.110
worldviews being forced to be in the

40
00:02:06.111 --> 00:02:07.570
same yes.

41
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.493
<v 1>Context?</v>

42
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.970
So we can agree if group one thinks a,

43
00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:18.650
B and C are the fundamental aspects of their worldview and argue within that and

44
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.980
world group two things D E and F and argue with them that,

45
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.770
so you're going to have a lot of argument within those space,

46
00:02:24.771 --> 00:02:27.380
but if there's fundamental differences in worldview,

47
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.960
there's no reason to be,

48
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.260
especially when each views the other as completely coherent and, and reasonable.

49
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.150
<v 0>Do you think there's a line of fundamentally different</v>

50
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.460
worldviews that, uh,

51
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.290
along which the succession will happen in the United States? Like,

52
00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:49.640
is there something that emergency you as a set of ideas that are like,

53
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.800
um, what do you call that? Like, you can't come to a,

54
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.480
you can't come to an agreement over.

55
00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.460
<v 1>I, yeah, I think this is already happening. Like with the, um,</v>

56
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:05.020
I think there's just two fundamental perspective and each one thinks the other

57
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:09.310
is insane and also deadly and destructive.

58
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.140
And I don't see how there's any, um, discourse on this topic.

59
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.320
So on the left, I wouldn't say it's left versus right.

60
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:21.460
I think it's people who are pro risk versus people who are risk averse.

61
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.490
<v 0>Yeah. So risk averse. And then there's like a, uh, uh,</v>

62
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.920
hope for the comfort of the sort of, uh,

63
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.930
centralized science, uh, giving the truth.

64
00:03:36.931 --> 00:03:39.900
And then everybody must follow the truth right. Of, uh,

65
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.780
the proper way to behave. And then there's a, on the other side,

66
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.300
a distrust of any kind of centralized institutions of anybody

67
00:03:48.301 --> 00:03:52.020
who might, uh, use, uh,

68
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.070
like control to try to gain greater and greater power and masks are a symbol of

69
00:03:56.071 --> 00:04:00.330
that. And even if masks are, are not a,

70
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.910
uh, effective way of, uh, of stopping the virus,

71
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.640
which is really unfortunate to me as a, from a perspective,

72
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.190
I happened to be on a survey paper about masks.

73
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.420
Like people don't seem to care about the data or the so on it's this, this,

74
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.220
this has become just a nice point on which to then highlight the

75
00:04:20.221 --> 00:04:24.450
difference between, uh, the two, the two sides. Yeah. That's really interesting.

76
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.110
I mean.

77
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.000
<v 1>I it's, it.</v>

78
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.660
<v 0>Sounds kind of on the face kind of ridiculous that the succession would occur</v>

79
00:04:30.661 --> 00:04:31.494
over masks.

80
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.950
<v 1>It wouldn't,</v>

81
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.800
but I'm saying this is an example of something where there's a clean break. Yes.

82
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.610
Um, and, and risk averse versus, you know, uh,

83
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.560
someone who's risk seeking.

84
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.200
These are just two fundamentally different perspectives.

85
00:04:43.201 --> 00:04:45.000
Do you want to have an NHS or do you have a,

86
00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:49.320
one of a market-based healthcare system you can make very valid arguments for

87
00:04:49.321 --> 00:04:52.110
both. There's no reason for everyone to be under one.

88
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.360
<v 0>You think that's not something that's that you think that's irreconcilable?</v>

89
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.920
If that's the word. Yeah. Uh,

90
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.600
that that's not in the space of ideas that you can have in the same room

91
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.720
together, and they fight each other and ultimately make progress. Like they,

92
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.980
that succession is the more effective way to proceed forward. Yes.

93
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.370
Well, I, uh,

94
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.540
do you see a possible world would knows the answer,

95
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.810
meaning, uh, I know you say yes,

96
00:05:21.811 --> 00:05:26.160
because you kind of lean on the side of freedom and are anarchism. Yes.

97
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.230
Like you make, you want to make,

98
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.860
let me make an argument in terms of divorce,

99
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.560
which is in your worldview or your intuition is you want to

100
00:05:37.561 --> 00:05:42.210
make succession as frictionless as possible. Like along all lines,

101
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.510
not just like States or whatever, just like absolutely. You want to choose,

102
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.550
you want to be free. Yeah. And peaceful. Let me make my authoritarian,

103
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.130
uh, Russian Papa stallion argument in terms of

104
00:05:56.131 --> 00:06:00.620
relationships, like when goes wrong in a relationship,

105
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.000
not your language. Okay.

106
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.440
There's only a place for once thought at this table. Okay. Okay.

107
00:06:09.441 --> 00:06:12.290
I'll get to you Lennon. You know, you get to be like,

108
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.090
Merkel is our previous discussion with gluten. Okay. The only me only the hands,

109
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.093
uh, it, you know,

110
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.390
you want to work through some of the troubles before you get divorced.

111
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:25.470
Like you want to do the work and relationships sometimes.

112
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:30.290
Like it goes up and down, like in 200 plus years, it's, uh, it's done,

113
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.030
but in the listen, okay. So it's not a one night stand, but you know,

114
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.410
look at it.

115
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.960
<v 1>Trump, this, I don't see the middle ground.</v>

116
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.380
He's either a complete calamity buffoon,

117
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.850
or he's been the first grade president we've had in many, many years.

118
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.460
<v 0>So you think that there's something different now than it was 20 years ago? Yes.</v>

119
00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.650
<v 1>Social media and access to information.</v>

120
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.700
<v 0>And the division will only increase you think, Oh yes.</v>

121
00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.090
So Trump is not an accident of history. So zebra.

122
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.070
<v 1>Thought Trump was the river, but he was the dam.</v>

123
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.140
<v 0>Trump was the dam. They thought he was the river.</v>

124
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:13.420
So not analogy Trump being gone makes things worse.

125
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.050
Yeah.

126
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.350
<v 1>For them perspective, because now that things are really going to hit the fan.</v>

127
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.080
<v 0>So what are the odds of succession? I don't know.</v>

128
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.070
<v 1>And my desperate hope is that it's peaceful.</v>

129
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.510
But I think the number of people who are becoming very comfortable with the

130
00:07:31.511 --> 00:07:33.850
violence is making me very unsettled.

131
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.500
<v 0>Well, I see words as violence and your Twitter.</v>

132
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.510
It's like Hiroshima is a million. Uh,

133
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.980
sometimes I curl up in the corner crying after I check your Twitter feed.

134
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.950
So, but you in, uh, in all seriousness,

135
00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:57.040
you, um, you think is possible to do non-violence session.

136
00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:58.660
It's a bit Czechoslovakia.

137
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.110
<v 1>Look at Brexit. Brexit was the succession.</v>

138
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.100
<v 0>Right? Right. So you can have.</v>

139
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:07.900
<v 1>Civil war did not need to be fought.</v>

140
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.830
That would have been a non-violence session. And if you worry about slavery,

141
00:08:11.831 --> 00:08:14.230
you could have bought off all the slaves, import them to the North.

142
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.230
It still would have been cheaper and less loss of life and probably better for

143
00:08:17.231 --> 00:08:18.064
race relations.

144
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.650
<v 0>Yeah. I don't know enough history to,</v>

145
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:23.920
to wonder about like how the civil war could have been avoided. Well,

146
00:08:23.921 --> 00:08:27.730
that's how is a well conversation?

147
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:29.440
So like, no, no, no.

148
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.960
<v 1>If they want us to seed say, look, here's what we're going to do.</v>

149
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:34.810
We're going to let you succeed. But you have to end up slate.

150
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.480
You have to end slavery. They succeeded because of slavery. Here's the thing.

151
00:08:37.481 --> 00:08:40.480
This is like this. Some circles of conservatism have this myth that, Oh,

152
00:08:40.481 --> 00:08:42.550
it wasn't about slavery is about States' rights. Well,

153
00:08:42.551 --> 00:08:44.800
if you go back every state, when they succeeded,

154
00:08:44.801 --> 00:08:47.140
released a press release and they said, explicitly,

155
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:48.160
we're doing this because of slavery.

156
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.280
So that is an abomination that needs to be taken care of.

157
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:54.850
But the way the other countries have ended slavery,

158
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.740
one of the ways to do it is pay them by all.

159
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.950
And we ended up doing this after the war. I think the South people got, um,

160
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:06.090
reparations, the slave owners. It was just insane. Bring them North.

161
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.960
You want to go to cannon, whatever. And you agree. And that's our peace treaty

162
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.940
because the people who died, weren't the slave owners, it was white trash.

163
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.990
And it was that's who always, and I hate that. That's the term.

164
00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:19.980
I can't think of a better one,

165
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:22.950
but that's who always ends up fighting these Wars often disproportionately it's

166
00:09:22.951 --> 00:09:25.830
poor people and an educated people. And I don't, I don't,

167
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.560
I did not regard them as cannon fodder. I think it's horrible.

168
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.620
<v 0>So what would it look like? There'll be two founding documents.</v>

169
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.810
<v 1>Yeah. They had their, they had their constitution.</v>

170
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.600
<v 0>Which I don't know the history of the, yeah.</v>

171
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.120
<v 1>They had a constitution, but it was much more decentralized.</v>

172
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.600
<v 0>If succession doesn't happen. Yeah.</v>

173
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:51.500
You said that Donald Trump was the dam, not the river. Yeah.

174
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.800
The, that, that sounds like Walt Whitman or something.

175
00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:58.940
You shouldn't it's poetry. Okay. And you flirting with me.

176
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.590
I don't, I w uh, w you know, we don't, we don't flirt.

177
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:07.250
We just go it's out in the club and drag you to the.

178
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.593
<v 1>Cave.</v>

179
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.760
<v 0>And you don't want to know about the Sickles. It's not good cop, bad cop.</v>

180
00:10:13.761 --> 00:10:17.480
It's bad cop us. Yeah.

181
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:22.490
What do you think 2024 looks like, uh,

182
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.680
in terms of the candidates.

183
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:29.390
<v 1>And it's going to be CommonWell Harris as the democratic candidate. Uh,</v>

184
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.330
I'm really looking forward to Ted Cruz versus Mike Pence,

185
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.880
because they're both very good at debate. Um,

186
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:38.780
that would be interesting to see that differentiate themselves. But honestly,

187
00:10:38.781 --> 00:10:42.260
I don't, I mean, things are going to get really ugly really soon.

188
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:46.910
What about Donald Trump coming back? He's not going to do it. Um, so things,

189
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.660
in my opinion, I think things are going to be really, really crazy in 2021.

190
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.820
And talk, talking about the dam being gone like.

191
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.160
<v 0>20, 21. So this year going up.</v>

192
00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.740
<v 1>Oh yeah. It's going to be complete. It's going to be complete mayhem.</v>

193
00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:02.570
<v 0>You think, uh, like prediction wise and this is empirical.</v>

194
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:07.640
What do you think Donald Trump's Twitter feed looks like

195
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:12.770
in 2021? Like, if we're at the end of 2021, we'll look back and see, like,

196
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:18.020
what was the, you know, Obama gate exclamation points,

197
00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.033
or we won.

198
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.700
<v 1>It's going to be for the first time in history,</v>

199
00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:26.690
holding the Republican party accountable to the, the base.

200
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:29.920
We've never had that happen before. I, uh,

201
00:11:29.921 --> 00:11:34.190
I think he's going to be holding their feet to the fire, uh, radicalizing them,

202
00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.450
uh, and given that they have the Senate where it's going to be 50, 50,

203
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:41.690
the Democrats have a three seat majority in the house.

204
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:44.510
This is not a governing coalition for either. Um,

205
00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:45.830
it's going to be complete mayhem.

206
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:48.590
<v 0>Does that actually look like, so w what are the key values?</v>

207
00:11:48.591 --> 00:11:50.630
Do you think that he's, he's going to try it again.

208
00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.280
<v 1>Um, I think it's just going to be very it's,</v>

209
00:11:54.281 --> 00:11:56.590
he's going to be holding them accountable in terms of budgeting,

210
00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:59.140
even though he never did that as president. Uh,

211
00:11:59.141 --> 00:12:02.470
I think in terms of some kind of nominations, here's the thing.

212
00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:04.720
This is the first time since, um.

213
00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.780
<v 0>Uh, like S Nixon, uh.</v>

214
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:12.720
<v 1>50 Years and things weren't as politicized then where an incoming president</v>

215
00:12:12.721 --> 00:12:13.950
doesn't have control of the Senate.

216
00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:18.360
The Senate has the vote over cabinet positions.

217
00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:23.610
I do not see a possibility of them not trying to pick a fight on one or

218
00:12:23.611 --> 00:12:26.220
two of these nominations. And that's going to,

219
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.960
and especially as we're venture Kavanaugh,

220
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.740
this is going to get very bloody very quickly. And I think Mitch McConnell,

221
00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.390
there's a sadistic side to him. He revels in being the brakes on the car.

222
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.300
And I think the base is just going to be throwing just,

223
00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.430
they're going to want some bone. It's like, Oh yeah, we,

224
00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.200
we eliminated this one person.

225
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.390
So that's going to get really ugly really quickly.

226
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:50.100
<v 0>You see it being quite diverse, like division increasing,</v>

227
00:12:50.101 --> 00:12:54.390
not stabilizing or decreasing. Uh, and I'll be doing my part.

228
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.650
I know you'll be doing my part when I'm trying to do my part. And like,

229
00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:03.150
trying to beak, like, to me, the division is, uh,

230
00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:07.470
shouting over, uh, people like Elon Musk, uh,

231
00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:10.500
people who are actually building stuff and like accomplishing things in this

232
00:13:10.501 --> 00:13:13.050
world in terms of like Ilan said, he took the red pill,

233
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:16.770
not see, you're talking about the,

234
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.520
I'm talking about forgetting Elon SpaceX and Tesla. And, uh,

235
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:25.080
actually the good size of like some of the things that Google is doing, uh,

236
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.340
like actually building things, like making the world's information, searchable,

237
00:13:29.341 --> 00:13:31.560
all that kind of stuff. Like all this stuff, you know,

238
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:35.910
the making actually the world a better place.

239
00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.640
There's a bunch of technologies that are increasing our quality of life,

240
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.940
all this, all that kind of stuff. I feel like they get like,

241
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:46.920
not much credit or in our public discourse because of the

242
00:13:46.921 --> 00:13:48.300
division there. Isn't just like,

243
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:52.860
like peop it's clouding our ability to concentrate on.

244
00:13:52.861 --> 00:13:54.810
What's awesome about this world. Well.

245
00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.640
<v 1>You know, what would eliminate the division, right.</v>

246
00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:01.910
<v 0>So session. Yeah. See, I don't, I don't,</v>

247
00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:03.900
it's hard for me to disagree.

248
00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.370
It's hard to me to disagree because,

249
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:13.230
but at the same time succession, um, um,

250
00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:17.130
I'm a romantic at heart and you want a divorce breaks my heart.

251
00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:20.190
<v 1>Cool. But do you want to live in a country? Yeah.</v>

252
00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:24.960
But do you wanna live in a country where Joe Rogan is regarded as an example of

253
00:14:24.961 --> 00:14:26.430
someone who's spreading white supremacy?

254
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.710
<v 0>I don't. Well, but see, I feel like that's not the country we live in.</v>

255
00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.630
That's just times.

256
00:14:33.631 --> 00:14:37.020
Did it take a thedral does it on a regular basis? Well,

257
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:40.920
the cathedral is okay. The cathedral,

258
00:14:40.921 --> 00:14:42.720
I guess you can maybe define the cathedral,

259
00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.320
but it's like the centralized institutions that have like a story that they're

260
00:14:46.321 --> 00:14:47.154
trying to sell.

261
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.630
<v 1>Yeah. This is mold blocks concept, but yeah,</v>

262
00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.740
they basically are set the limits of permissible discourse and create a

263
00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:53.600
narrative for the population to follow.

264
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.490
<v 0>But to me, that's the minority of people.</v>

265
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.490
<v 1>Minorities always controlling everything in any country.</v>

266
00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.500
The vast majority of the masses have no thought.

267
00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:04.180
<v 0>Minorities can be overthrown in the circulation, the elites. Yeah.</v>

268
00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.150
The way the PR. And that's why the,

269
00:15:07.151 --> 00:15:11.500
what progress looks like is ridiculous. People take power and then,

270
00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:16.150
uh, they get annoying and new ridiculous people that are a little bit better

271
00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:17.380
overthrow the previous.

272
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:21.040
<v 1>No, I think progress happens despite the people who were in power,</v>

273
00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:21.903
not because of them.

274
00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:26.980
<v 0>Right. And so why is the session? So is,</v>

275
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.040
is it always about overthrowing the powerful? Is that how it progress?

276
00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.560
<v 1>No. I think progress happens despite the powerful,</v>

277
00:15:32.561 --> 00:15:36.190
the powerful are going to do what's in their power to maintain their power.

278
00:15:36.191 --> 00:15:39.100
And they're going to fight innovation because it's a threat to their control.

279
00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:42.130
<v 0>There's always going to be the New York times of the world. Right.</v>

280
00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.250
There's always going to be those that have in their country.

281
00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:49.900
So it's two countries. One has Joe Rogan, the other one has the New York times.

282
00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.800
<v 1>That's basically what's happening right now. It's just geographically,</v>

283
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.350
this map out very well, but culturally. Yeah.

284
00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:01.240
<v 0>Yes. But that's just cultural stuff. Like there's a layer of public discourse.</v>

285
00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.540
Okay. I don't mean like, that's what we're operating under now,

286
00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:08.590
but there's actual like progress being made like roads being built, uh,

287
00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:10.870
hospitals being run, all those kinds of things.

288
00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:15.460
Like the different innovations that seems like succession is counter

289
00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:16.630
productive to that.

290
00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.290
<v 1>Right.</v>

291
00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:19.180
Cause one country would have all the roads and the other would have all the

292
00:16:19.181 --> 00:16:21.010
hospitals. That's great.

293
00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.890
<v 0>No, that's not, that's not the point I'm trying to make. It's just like,</v>

294
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:28.750
it just feels like the division that we're experiencing in the space of ideas

295
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:32.830
could be constructive and productive for,

296
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.260
for building better roads and better hospitals,

297
00:16:35.261 --> 00:16:39.160
as opposed to like using that division to separate the countries,

298
00:16:39.161 --> 00:16:43.590
they're all going to have to solve the same problems. It feels like, like sure.

299
00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:48.130
<v 1>But they can solve them differently and compete that way. Massive sample. Yeah.</v>

300
00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:49.540
That w we're seeing that right now,

301
00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:51.850
different countries have different mass mandates and things like this.

302
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.781
<v 0>And, uh,</v>

303
00:16:52.781 --> 00:16:57.310
the co competition within the same structure within the same founding documents.

304
00:16:57.311 --> 00:16:59.110
And same as the Titians is not effective,

305
00:16:59.111 --> 00:17:01.330
you think is as effective as separating.

306
00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.610
<v 1>Defective. But there is a certain point,</v>

307
00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:07.870
which I think we have long past where there is not a consensus governing

308
00:17:07.871 --> 00:17:09.910
consensus, ideologically or culturally.
