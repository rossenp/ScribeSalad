00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.020
<v 0>Please allow me to say a few words about the COVID vaccines.</v>

2
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.660
Some people are scared of a virus hurting or killing somebody. They love.

3
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.460
Some are scared of their government, betraying them.

4
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.620
They're leaders blinded by power and greed.

5
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.020
<v 1>I have both of these fears and two I'm afraid as FDR,</v>

6
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.690
a fear itself,

7
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.370
fear manifests as anger and anger leads to division in the hands of

8
00:00:30.371 --> 00:00:34.970
charismatic leaders who then manufacture truth in quotes

9
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.890
that maximize controversy and a sense of imminent crisis that only they can save

10
00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:44.040
us from. And though I'm sometimes mocked for of this.

11
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.800
I still believe that love compassion.

12
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.520
Empathy is the way out from this vicious downward spiral of division.

13
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.440
I personally took the vaccine based on my understanding of the data,

14
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.800
deciding that for me,

15
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.880
the risk of negative effects from COVID short term and long term are far worse.

16
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.110
The, of the negative effects from the RNA vaccine.

17
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.110
<v 0>I read, I thought I decided from me,</v>

18
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.950
but I never have,

19
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.670
and never will talked down to people who don't take the vaccine.

20
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.070
I'm humble enough to know just how little I know how wrong I have been

21
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.380
and will be many of my beliefs and ideas. I think dogmatic,

22
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.060
certainty and division is more destructive in the long term than any virus.

23
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.620
<v 1>The solution for me personally, like I said,</v>

24
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.140
is to choose empathy and compassion towards all fellow human beings,

25
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.180
no matter who they voted for.

26
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.530
I hope you do the same read think and try to imagine

27
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.410
that what you currently think is the truth may be totally wrong.

28
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.690
This mindset is one that opens you to discovery innovation and wisdom.

29
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.330
I hope my conversation with Vincent Rello is a useful resource for just this

30
00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:04.210
kind of exploration.

31
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.320
He doesn't talk down to people and he's the most knowledgeable virologist I've

32
00:02:09.321 --> 00:02:12.000
ever spoken to. He has no political agenda,

33
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.040
no desire to mock those who disagree with him.

34
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.200
He just loves biology and explaining the fundamental mechanisms of how

35
00:02:20.201 --> 00:02:24.880
biological systems work. That's a great person to listen to and learn from,

36
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.230
with an open mind. I hope you join me in doing so and no matter what,

37
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.990
try to put more love out there in the world.
