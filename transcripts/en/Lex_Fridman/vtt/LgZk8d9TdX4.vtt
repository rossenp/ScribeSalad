1
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.930
<v 0>You wrote the book, American cosmic, UFOs,</v>

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.850
religion technology. What was the goal of writing this book? What,

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.530
uh, maybe we'll mention it. We have already mentioned it many times,

4
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:20.880
but in this little space of a conversation,

5
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.040
can you say maybe what is the key insight that you found that lingers with you

6
00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:30.630
to this day from the process, the long process of, uh,

7
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.310
putting this book together? Sure.

8
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.140
<v 1>Just like with my book on purgatory, um,</v>

9
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.460
I went into the research thinking that it would be something that it was

10
00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:43.250
entirely not, it ended up being something completely different.

11
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.360
And I think that's good.

12
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.100
I think that people who do research need to ne are very excited actually when

13
00:00:49.101 --> 00:00:50.330
their research surprises them.

14
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.520
So I was happily surprised by my pro book to learn that it

15
00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:58.790
was a place, you know? And, and so, um,

16
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.000
I went into American,

17
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:06.140
cosmic being a non-believer in UFO's entirely,

18
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.910
and I came out being agnostic. Okay.

19
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.333
Kind of believer.

20
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.100
<v 0>But agnostic sort of, uh, open to the mysteries of the world. Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.790
<v 1>Yes. And I didn't think that, first of all,</v>

22
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.860
I knew that the government was,

23
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.940
it was part of the situation.

24
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.650
I just didn't know how much.

25
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.000
And so I learned that quickly and acclimated to it,

26
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.740
um,

27
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.420
accepted it and noted that

28
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.320
indeed her ratio,

29
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.830
the world is much more mysterious than we think it

30
00:01:54.831 --> 00:01:56.270
is. It's more mysterious.

31
00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.090
There are more mysteries in this life than your philosophy provides for.

32
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.230
<v 0>So is a sense American cosmic is about the mysteries of the</v>

33
00:02:06.231 --> 00:02:10.520
modern life as encapsulated by this, the,

34
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.450
the realm of technology in the realm of alien intelligences.

35
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.030
<v 1>Yes. I think that, um, I think that, I mean,</v>

36
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.860
I'd have to go off record as a professor and talk personally as a person.

37
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.110
I do think that, um,

38
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.200
there are mysteries of which we have an inkling

39
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.500
and if it's something as powerful as

40
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.073
non-human intelligence,

41
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.620
whether or not it's from another planet extraterrestrial,

42
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.450
or it happens to be from like another dimension or something else,

43
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.510
I think that this is going to, um,

44
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.890
get the attention of institutions of power. And indeed,

45
00:02:54.891 --> 00:02:58.010
I think that's what has happened. And, um,

46
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.690
although probably he,

47
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.440
people have had interactions with these things.

48
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.340
It appears to me historically, uh, for a long time,

49
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:10.840
as long as humans have existed,

50
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.640
I would imagine that indeed. Um,

51
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.770
this is something that's quite powerful and could change the belief structures

52
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.360
of our entire societies, our civilization, basically.

53
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.750
<v 2>So it's the same way that you, them,</v>

54
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.380
the belief structures were strongly effected by religious beliefs throughout

55
00:03:31.381 --> 00:03:35.610
history in the same way. This has the potential, uh,

56
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.060
it, it, uh, serves as, um,

57
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.170
a source of concern for the powerful,

58
00:03:43.171 --> 00:03:47.850
because it can have very significant effects on the populace. Yes.
