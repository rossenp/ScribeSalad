00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.970
<v 0>How long did it take you to find the thing that, um, you have fun with?</v>

2
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:08.803
<v 1>Oh, I, I don't know.</v>

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.170
I've been a fun person since I was pretty little so everything's,

4
00:00:12.171 --> 00:00:15.490
I've gone through a couple periods of depression in my life or.

5
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.970
<v 0>Good reason or for, uh, the reason doesn't make any sense. Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.843
<v 1>Like some, some things are hard.</v>

7
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.400
You go through mental transitions in high school.

8
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.160
I was really depressed for a year. And I,

9
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.960
I think I had my first midlife crisis at 26. I kind of thought,

10
00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:37.480
is this all there is like, I was working at a job that I loved and,

11
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.800
but I was going to work and all my time is consumed.

12
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.150
<v 0>What's what's the escape out of that depression. What's the answer to is,</v>

13
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.710
is this all there is, well.

14
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.350
<v 1>A friend of mine, I asked him cuz he was working his off. I said,</v>

15
00:00:50.351 --> 00:00:54.750
what's your work life balance? Like, like there's, you know, work, friends,

16
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.910
family, personal time, are you balancing the internet? And he said,

17
00:00:58.911 --> 00:01:03.630
work 80% family, 20%. And I try to, I try to find some time to sleep.

18
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.300
Like there's no personal time. There's no passionate time. Like,

19
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.060
you know, young people are often passionate about work. So,

20
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.140
and I was certainly like that, but you need to,

21
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.820
you need to have some space in your life for different things.

22
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.460
<v 0>And that's that creates, uh, that makes you resistant to the whole,</v>

23
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.250
the, the, the dip, the, the deep dips into depression kind of thing.

24
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.410
<v 1>Yeah. Well you have to get to know yourself too. Meditation helps some physical,</v>

25
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.130
something physically intense helps like the.

26
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.930
<v 0>Weird places your mind.</v>

27
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.170
<v 1>Goes kind of thing. Yeah. Like, and why does it happen?</v>

28
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:41.703
Why do you do what you do?

29
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.010
<v 0>Like triggers, like the things that cause your mind to,</v>

30
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.720
of different places kind of thing, or, uh, events like you're.

31
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.600
<v 1>Upbringing for better or worse, whether your parents are great people or not,</v>

32
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.400
you, you, you come into, you know,

33
00:01:56.401 --> 00:01:59.760
adulthood with all kinds of emotional burdens. Yeah.

34
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.560
And you can see some people are so bloody stiff and restrained and they think,

35
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.230
you know, the world's fundamentally negative. Like you, maybe you,

36
00:02:08.231 --> 00:02:12.070
you have unexplored territory. Yeah. Or you're afraid of something.

37
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.990
<v 0>Uh, definitely afraid of quite a few things.</v>

38
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.470
<v 1>Then you gotta go face them. &lt;laugh&gt; like, like,</v>

39
00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:22.350
what's the worst thing that can happen. You're gonna die. Right? Yeah.

40
00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:23.190
Like that's inevitable.

41
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.340
You might as well get over that like a hundred percent death rate mean people

42
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.180
were worried about the virus, but you know, the human condition is,

43
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.100
is pretty deadly.
