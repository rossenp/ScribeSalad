00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.970
<v 0>What do you think about that as a advice for an individual turn</v>

2
00:00:07.971 --> 00:00:09.610
the other cheek, do you think? Uh,

3
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.850
I tend to believe that that's a really good way to live.

4
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.450
<v 1>I think it's very underrated and this is me talking.</v>

5
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.090
I think a lot of times when someone suppose you're having an argument and,

6
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.360
but you have to, you have to pick your battles. Right.

7
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.680
I suppose you're having a heat argument.

8
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.120
If someone says something very cruel to you,

9
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.920
you have attempted to double down and hit back twice as hard. Right.

10
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.920
But if it's someone who had all cares about you,

11
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.120
what they're just in the moment and you just stop and you just say,

12
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.840
did you hear what you said to me? For some cases,

13
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.040
that person will take a step back and be like, just like we,

14
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:45.990
when I snapped at Michael, uh, at Stein years ago, I'd be like, wow, okay, this,

15
00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:48.870
this is bad. This is bad. I'm sorry. And they kind of, you know,

16
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.710
it's kind of like they have to get to 10 before they re control a delete to use

17
00:00:53.711 --> 00:00:54.790
your language. Thank.

18
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.590
<v 0>You. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; for overflow. I appreciate that.</v>

19
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.310
<v 1>But, and for some they're gonna, they're gonna just twist the knife. Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.990
But I think this is a very useful technique.

21
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.260
And also you can also sleep well at night cuz you could be like,

22
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.940
as much as this person tried to hurt me, I still didn't reciprocate.

23
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.780
And yeah, I, I took that punch and it sucks,

24
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.860
but at least I never said anything that I could feel guilty about.

25
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.643
<v 0>Exactly.</v>

26
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.010
Do you think that's ultimately a good way to implement anarchy in your personal

27
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.490
life? Uh.

28
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.330
<v 1>Anarchy, I don't implementing anarchy in your personal life just means, uh,</v>

29
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.290
respecting people's boundaries. It means uh, um, uh,

30
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.490
not forcing people to do things that otherwise wouldn't wanna do.

31
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.890
<v 0>I think you then have to take, um,</v>

32
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.880
case by case like there's so many human interactions that are required for life.

33
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.840
Sure. Of course. And there's tension and all those kinds of things.

34
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.240
It's not always, am I being naive.

35
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.473
<v 1>For you to sit yeah.</v>

36
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.240
<v 0>Being you're being so naive? No. Should I put the.</v>

37
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.080
<v 1>Hat on? &lt;laugh&gt; the hats on the other.</v>

38
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.320
<v 0>Head? Nah, well I had to take off the head cause it's like photo with the ring.</v>

39
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.990
I was starting to feel like powerful. I,

40
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.070
I wanted to give you orders and I want no, I, I, I just, I think there's, uh,

41
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.230
ways of dealing with the tensions that are natural to human interactions,

42
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.830
that can't be simply, um, you know, uh,

43
00:02:20.831 --> 00:02:25.590
it's not as simple as saying you want to respect the freedom of others and

44
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.100
um, the, the boundaries of others, it's like,

45
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.700
you both have to agree on stuff and work something out.

46
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.740
And the mechanisms of that agreement,

47
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.900
the game theory of that agreement requires different hacks and strategies. Sure.

48
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.140
And the, the,

49
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.300
the question is for an anarchist collective that's

50
00:02:45.301 --> 00:02:49.210
well-functioning what kind of hacks, uh,

51
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.610
what kind of, ways of behavior are more likely to be productive and not,

52
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.170
you know, that that's almost like the question.

53
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.520
Do you want to turn the other cheek or do you wanna stand your ground really

54
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.840
firmly when somebody's an to you,

55
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.600
you walk away or when somebody's an to you,

56
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.480
you turn the other cheek and give 'em a chance to rise to the best version of

57
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:14.200
themselves. Sure. And then find, uh, a common ground kind of thing. It's a,

58
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.360
it's an open question of how to form those collectives when there's people with,

59
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.750
with difficult childhoods and the all that kind.

60
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.583
<v 1>Of stuff. Well,</v>

61
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.550
it also comes down to what is your relationship with this person, right?

62
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.430
Is this outta character, if you and I got into a disagreement,

63
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.590
all of a sudden you started getting very personal, first of all,

64
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.310
I'd be very hurt. Yeah. But then I'd be like,

65
00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:34.590
this is outta character for L I'm sure I could be like, whoa, whoa,

66
00:03:34.591 --> 00:03:37.110
let's take a pause here. Like you're getting heated. Yeah.

67
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.230
I'm trying to work this out.

68
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.860
What's going on here and you get it kind of a meta conversation, but again,

69
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:45.380
you and I have a relationship with mutual respect. So as opposed to,

70
00:03:45.381 --> 00:03:49.380
if it was a stranger, you know, who's yeah. Just wants a piece of you.

71
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.980
It's just like, I don't, you are coming at me. Not correct.

72
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.900
I don't have to reciprocate in kind. I'm not gonna shoot you,

73
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.220
but I'm not gonna pretend that you deserve respect when you're treating me with

74
00:03:59.221 --> 00:04:04.130
such Tim. Um, I would, I do defer, especially with people.

75
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.250
I know cuz it's just,

76
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.050
this is smart long term game theory as well as the right thing to do.

77
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.890
I do try to give them the benefit of doubt at first, right? Yeah.

78
00:04:10.891 --> 00:04:13.010
Because if you're gonna go agro, you can't go back,

79
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.010
but you could always go from like, let me hear them out and then,

80
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.490
then I could go agro. So there's a big asymmetry there.

81
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.000
<v 0>Yeah. And, and that's, I mean,</v>

82
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.240
I don't think anyone has the answer to this question is,

83
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.080
is that the right strategy to me game theoretically,

84
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.080
it seems the right strategy is to, uh, well.

85
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.640
<v 1>Reciprocity is what game theory says is the right strategy.</v>

86
00:04:31.641 --> 00:04:34.880
They did the prisoners dilemma and they found ti for tat is the one that's the

87
00:04:34.881 --> 00:04:35.714
most advantageous.

88
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.520
<v 0>So that's for when that's perfectly rational actors. But when you have, I mean,</v>

89
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:43.030
there's noise that the there's a,

90
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.790
I think benefit to just even if they keep being to you

91
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.150
still being nice to them. Well then there's the inverse.

92
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.310
<v 1>Where girls are turned off. Some people are like,</v>

93
00:04:53.311 --> 00:04:55.190
if you're in a relationship and not just girls,

94
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.430
but girls like some people when you're kind to them,

95
00:04:57.431 --> 00:05:01.340
they find you less attractive. Right? Yeah. Like that is kind of this weird.

96
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.460
What am I supposed to do? Like you are only into me if I'm mean to you.

97
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.900
I don't wanna be mean, but then I'm getting punished for doing the right thing.

98
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.100
That's another tricky one. And I mean,

99
00:05:11.101 --> 00:05:14.660
this is nothing that necessarily do with anarchism so much as like, you know,

100
00:05:14.661 --> 00:05:17.940
human beings are infinitely complex. We don't know if I know the back story.

101
00:05:17.941 --> 00:05:22.130
Like for example, just yesterday, Jay who's here is one of my close his friends.

102
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.970
I had a dinner with a bunch of people. I couldn't bring a plus four.

103
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.890
So I didn't, he wasn't invited, he didn't know the circumstances.

104
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.530
He just thought we were having dinner, Adam. He was hurt. Once I spelled it out,

105
00:05:33.531 --> 00:05:34.890
he completely understood it.

106
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.290
I felt horrible because for me to have any of my friends feel left out is just a

107
00:05:39.291 --> 00:05:41.850
very, very cruel thing. Yeah. Um, and I was,

108
00:05:41.851 --> 00:05:43.840
I felt bad and I'm glad to apologize again,

109
00:05:43.841 --> 00:05:46.880
publicly that that's end up being the circumstances. But yeah, it's, it's, it's,

110
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.720
it's a lot of times we're also in Plato's cave when you're dealing with somebody

111
00:05:50.721 --> 00:05:51.760
else, you have very,

112
00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:54.400
very limited information about their background and circumstances.

113
00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.840
And that's why I will always, if it's someone I even have a little bit of,

114
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.880
of relationship with, try to give them benefit of the doubt, because I've found,

115
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.240
especially this comes from being a co-author when you co-author books and you're

116
00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:09.760
walking other people's shoes, you don't know what's a lot of the information.

117
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.000
So if it it's a lot of times it's just a misunderstanding.

118
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.830
<v 0>But isn't that a fundamentally anarchist question of a, uh,</v>

119
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.430
how we figure out this puzzle of human complexities in order to form voluntary

120
00:06:21.431 --> 00:06:23.110
collectives. Like when you have to figure that out,

121
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.830
how to make Fe people feel good, how to make people. I agree. That's fair. And,

122
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.470
and that.

123
00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.550
<v 1>I, I think, I, I think not only anarchists have to think about this as my point,</v>

124
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.510
of course. Well, but we have to think about it more than others do.

125
00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.140
<v 0>Right. I.</v>
