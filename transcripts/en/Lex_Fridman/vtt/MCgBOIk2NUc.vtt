00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.190
<v 0>It goes along with my book,</v>

2
00:00:04.191 --> 00:00:09.110
which is basically making the argument that belief in non-human intelligence or

3
00:00:09.111 --> 00:00:13.850
ETS, or UFO's UAPs, whatever you want to call them is a new form of religion.

4
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.250
<v 1>And how's that work with the, the scientific method.</v>

5
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.350
Do you think there's always this role of religion as being in his broad

6
00:00:24.351 --> 00:00:29.210
definition of religion as being a compliment to our sort of very rigorous,

7
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.850
empirical pursuit of understanding reality,

8
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.620
there's always going to be this coupling will always define redefine new

9
00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:41.480
areas of civilization, of what that religion actually looks like.

10
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.310
So you talk about technology and so on being the modern set of religious

11
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.780
beliefs around that, is it, so is that always going to, is religion,

12
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.680
is religion always going to kind of cover the space of things?

13
00:00:54.681 --> 00:00:56.780
We can't quite understand what science yet,

14
00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.060
but we still want to be thinking about.

15
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.870
<v 0>Oh, I see what you're saying. That's a great question. When you say religion,</v>

16
00:01:02.871 --> 00:01:03.240
I would,

17
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.180
I would use the word religiosity because I think that we're moving

18
00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:11.750
out of the dogmatic types of religions into more of a,

19
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.380
I hate to put it this way, but an X-Files type religion where we can say,

20
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.860
I want to believe, or the truth is out there. Right.

21
00:01:18.861 --> 00:01:22.700
But we don't know that it's out there or we don't, we don't know yet what it is,

22
00:01:22.701 --> 00:01:26.930
but we know it's out there. So there's this, um, this kind of built-in, um,

23
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.610
capacity for belief and something that we don't have evidence for

24
00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:36.440
yet. And that's the sort of faith. So I would say yes to that question.

25
00:01:36.441 --> 00:01:40.280
Absolutely. I think it's adaptive in that way. We're moving into a new, I mean,

26
00:01:40.281 --> 00:01:42.530
heck removed. We've already moved into this culture.

27
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.520
Most people have not caught up with it yet. I see that in the school systems,

28
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.040
you know, and I think that, um,

29
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.830
I'm hoping we can catch up fast

30
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.920
cause really it's moving faster than we are.
