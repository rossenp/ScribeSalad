00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.540
<v 0>In terms of non believer and believer there's. Um,</v>

2
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.210
when you say believer, you also are kind of implying this, um,

3
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:14.580
uh, the,

4
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.140
that the idea that aliens have visited or had made direct contact with humans in

5
00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:23.620
some form. Um, there's also the,

6
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.180
the exploration and the idea of just alien,

7
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.560
intelligent intelligence is out there in the universe. You know,

8
00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:34.200
the Drake equation estimating how many

9
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.810
intelligent civilizations may be out there. How many have ever existed?

10
00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:42.210
How many of us to communicate with us? I mean,

11
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.310
when you just zoom out from our own little selfish perspective of

12
00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:51.210
earth and look at the entirety, let's say the Milky way galaxy,

13
00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:56.160
but maybe even the universe does the idea that they're intelligent civilizations

14
00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:56.994
out there,

15
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.580
something that you're excited about or something that you're terrified about?

16
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.550
<v 1>That's a good question.</v>

17
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.770
So basically I would say I'm not so keen on it.

18
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.710
Um, I think that our relationship with technology as it is,

19
00:01:15.711 --> 00:01:20.300
and as it, as I hope it will go, will help us, um,

20
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.520
survive. Okay. Um,

21
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.870
I don't think we're equipped to do it as we stand now,

22
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.580
but I think that if we can up our game or let's just put it this way,

23
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.210
if technology is an extension of ourselves, which it actually is,

24
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.860
it will help us because he'll probably be smarter than us. Okay.

25
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.480
It'll help us survive in the ways in which it determines best. Okay. That said,

26
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.330
um, if there are,

27
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.430
non-human intelligences out there and they have more

28
00:01:52.431 --> 00:01:56.510
advanced, you know, obviously technologies than us and they actually come,

29
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.880
um, uh, the history of human engagement with,

30
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.750
you know,

31
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.730
other cultures has not gone well for cultures that are

32
00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:11.570
less aggressive. So you see what I'm saying? Like,

33
00:02:11.571 --> 00:02:12.830
it's not a good idea.

34
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.720
<v 0>Well, I wonder where we stand on the war, human STEM,</v>

35
00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:19.280
the full spectrum of aggression.

36
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.690
<v 1>Well, heck where are we now, Lex? I mean, we're not too great here.</v>

37
00:02:23.691 --> 00:02:25.820
We're still aggressing against each other.

38
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.660
<v 0>No, I know, but that, that will give us the benefit, right? Like, Oh,</v>

39
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.290
all you're saying, I thought, okay. I see.

40
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.210
I just have a sense that there may be a lot of intelligence is out there that

41
00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:42.080
are less aggressive because they've evolved past it.

42
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.910
No, I know we can't assume that, but.

43
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.340
<v 1>I, if we can't assume it, then I'm going to assume the worst.</v>

44
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.960
<v 0>Well, that's, that's, uh, uh,</v>

45
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.520
despite the fact that I am a Russian and think that life is

46
00:02:58.521 --> 00:03:01.240
suffering, tend to assume not the best, but I,

47
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:05.590
I tend to assume that there is a best core to a,

48
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.660
to creatures, to people and to creatures that ultimately wins out.

49
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.490
I think there's an evolutionary advantage to being good

50
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.860
to other living creatures. And so, uh,

51
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.300
ultimately I think that if there's intelligent civilizations out there that

52
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.010
prosper sufficiently to be able to travel across the great spans of

53
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.700
space that, uh,

54
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.200
they've evolved past silly aggression,

55
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.810
that, uh, it's more likely in my mind to be deeply cooperative.

56
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.630
So like growth over destruction,

57
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.190
like growth does not require this structure, I think,

58
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.610
but you see the universe as a,

59
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.440
ultimately a place where it's highly constrained in resources that are necessary

60
00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:03.670
for traveling across space and time.

61
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.710
Then, uh, perhaps aggression is necessary in order to, uh,

62
00:04:08.711 --> 00:04:12.430
aggress against others that are designed to get access to those resources.

63
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.020
I don't know. I tend to try to be optimistic on that front.

64
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.840
I think I'm emotionally optimistic and intellectually non optimistic.

65
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.050
Uh, yeah, I guess I'm that I'm there with you. I,

66
00:04:27.051 --> 00:04:29.260
I T I tend to believe that the, uh,

67
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.000
happiness and deep fulfillment in life has fallen in that emotional place.

68
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480
Uh,

69
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.480
intellectual places really useful for building cool

70
00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:44.350
new technologies and ideas and so on, but, uh,

71
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.030
happiness is in the emotional place and there, it pays off to be optimistic.

72
00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:49.420
I think.
