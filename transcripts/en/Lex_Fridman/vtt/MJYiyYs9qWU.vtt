1
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.510
<v 0>We're not having any kind of smart conversation at a national level.</v>

2
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:08.380
In fact,

3
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.350
it's almost as if we've destroyed every sandbox

4
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:14.990
in which we could play together.

5
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.630
There's no place that we actually talk except longform podcasting.

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.740
And by the way, they've found you see what's going on with like Alex Stamos.

7
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.180
No. And the Hoover institution, we've, you know, there's a loophole left.

8
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.500
Longform podcasting allows people to speak at levels above daytime,

9
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.660
CNN &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. It's like, well,

10
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.620
why do you think they're not watching daytime CNN.

11
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.330
<v 1>But you know, that's, that's just silly journalism. They, uh,</v>

12
00:00:45.331 --> 00:00:49.090
currently have no power to displace podcasting. That's why it's so powerful.

13
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.411
RSS feed. I mean,

14
00:00:50.411 --> 00:00:53.930
that's why the big challenge with Joe Rogan and Spotify is like,

15
00:00:53.931 --> 00:00:58.850
there's this dance that's fascinating to see is Joe Rogan is not part of the

16
00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:59.703
system.

17
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.680
And then he's also UNC cancelable and there's this tension.

18
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.840
<v 0>That's happening. Well, think about what happened to Howard stern though,</v>

19
00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:09.680
Howard stern became much less relevant.

20
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.760
So if they can't control Joe by bringing him in house,

21
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.160
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; the key question is, is he going to continue? Like,

22
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.400
you know, this, Joe says this thing about Fu money. Yeah.

23
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.750
Joe's one of the only people with F Fu money.

24
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.030
Who's actually said F U yeah. Yeah.

25
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.910
I don't understand this. I don't have Fu money. What, what.

26
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.710
<v 1>Exactly is, can we break apart Fu money?</v>

27
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.030
Because I always thought I've been fortunate enough to,

28
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.660
I have always have F Fu money in the sense that my standards were so low that

29
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.340
a basic salary in the United States.

30
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.780
<v 0>Well, this is the stoic point, which is if you can live on rice and beans,</v>

31
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.140
right. You're UNC cancelable, because you're always rich relative to your.

32
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.260
<v 1>Needs, right? Isn't that F Fu fundamental F Fu money.</v>

33
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.060
Why do you say that tech billionaires don't have F Fu money.

34
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.010
<v 0>When you need to hire private six to protect your family?</v>

35
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.730
How do you protect your two children? I don't have those yet. Bingo. Yeah.

36
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.580
My point is, is that F U money insulates,

37
00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:19.020
everything that you care about, it's not just about you.

38
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.660
<v 1>So you're saying as the level of responsibility grows,</v>

39
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.100
the amount of money required for F U.

40
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.130
<v 0>We have a war going on. The war is on academic freedom.</v>

41
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.930
Academic freedom used to be present in the system as a, in terms of the idea we,

42
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.290
we trust our elite. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. Now we have an ideally,

43
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.210
you want to be the elite, you know, you wanna Lord above us. That's like,

44
00:02:43.211 --> 00:02:45.730
first of all, there's like a populist anti-elitist thing.

45
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.800
Then there's idea that, um, we're gonna defer tenure for forever.

46
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.600
Then we're gonna tell people, stay in your lane.

47
00:02:52.601 --> 00:02:55.960
Your tenure is only good for your own particular tiny micro subject.

48
00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.040
Then we're gonna also control your grants and be able to load up your teaching

49
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.361
load.

50
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:04.640
If we don't like who you are and we'll make your life absolutely impossible.

51
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.800
We lost academic freedom. And we ushered in peer review,

52
00:03:10.801 --> 00:03:11.800
which was a disaster.

53
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.840
And then we lost funding so that people were conf confident that they would have

54
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.670
the ability to do research no matter what they said.

55
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.310
And as a result, what you find is,

56
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.310
is a world in which there's no ability to get people to say, no,

57
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.350
I'm not gonna sign your diversity and inclusion, forced loyalty oath.

58
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.190
I won't sign any loyalty oath, get the hell outta my office. Uh,

59
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.340
you at you. And you're, you're connecting money to that. But, well, my point is,

60
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.620
is that academic freedom is the,

61
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.100
the whole idea behind it was that you will have the freedom of a billionaire on

62
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:53.700
a much smaller seller. Right? Okay.

63
00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.410
We've lost that. Yeah. The only reason in part that I wanted to it into

64
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.580
academic academics as a profession,

65
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.380
as opposed to wanting to do physical or mathematical research,

66
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.340
the great prize was freedom.

67
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.820
<v 2>And Ralph go, uh,</v>

68
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.620
of the Sloan foundation previously of IBM research pointed it at, he says, if,

69
00:04:17.621 --> 00:04:18.740
if you lose freedom,

70
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.850
you is the only thing we had to offer top minds,

71
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.050
top minds value their intellectual freedom and their physical and economic

72
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.010
security at a different level than other human beings.

73
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.770
And so people say, you know, I understand, dude,

74
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.810
you have the ability to do X, Y, and Z. What's the problem it's like, well,

75
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.320
I value my ability to raise the little finger as an American,

76
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.200
practically above everything else.
