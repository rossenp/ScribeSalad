1
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.850
<v 0>Where are you on the spectrum of hope for, uh,</v>

2
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.010
the role of automation in trucking?

3
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.130
<v 1>I think automation is, is inevitable. And again, I think the,</v>

4
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.750
this is really going to be transformative and it's going to be,

5
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.640
I I've studied the history of trucking technology as much as I can there,

6
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.830
you know, there's not a lot, a lot of great stuff written.

7
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.810
Then you kind of have to, you know, uh,

8
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.080
there isn't a lot of data in places to knows our volumes of stuff and how

9
00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:34.130
they're changing, et cetera.

10
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.660
But the big revolutionary changes in,

11
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.530
in trucking are because of constellations of factors.

12
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.940
It's not just one thing, right? So Daimler builds, you know, motorized truck.

13
00:00:46.941 --> 00:00:51.650
<v 2>And I think it's 1896, right? Um, inner city trucking.</v>

14
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.150
So basically what they use that truck for is just to swap out horses, right.

15
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.110
They basically do the same thing. The service doesn't really change, you know?

16
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.490
Um, and then world war II really spurs the development of bigger,

17
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.080
larger trucks like spreads, you know, air, air filled tires.

18
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.420
<v 1>And then we start paving roads, right. And paved roads,</v>

19
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.800
right. Air-filled tires and the internal combustion engine.

20
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.480
Now you've got a winning mix.

21
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.160
Now it met with demand for people who wanted to get out from under the thumb of

22
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.020
the railroads, right?

23
00:01:27.021 --> 00:01:31.880
So there was all of this pent up demand to get cheaper freight from

24
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.860
the countryside into cities and between cities that typically had to go by

25
00:01:36.861 --> 00:01:39.230
rail. And so now, you know,

26
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.800
40 years after that internal combustion engine,

27
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.640
it becomes this absolutely essential, right. This necessary,

28
00:01:46.641 --> 00:01:51.590
but not sufficient piece of technology to create the modern trucking industry,

29
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.720
um, in the 1930s.

30
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.010
And I think self-driving is going to be self-driving trucks are going to be part

31
00:01:58.011 --> 00:02:01.940
of that. And the idea, I don't know, I guess we, we credit Jeff Bezos.

32
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.100
The idea is, you know, um, okay, so Sam Walton,

33
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.880
if we can do it like a slight tangent on sort of the importance of trucking to

34
00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:14.300
business strategy and sort of how it has transformed our, our world,

35
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.480
the central insight that Sam Walton had that made him the giant that he

36
00:02:20.481 --> 00:02:24.560
was in influencing the way that so many people get stuff

37
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.660
was a trucking insight.

38
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.360
And so if you look at the way that he developed his system,

39
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.620
you build a distribution center and then you ring it with stores.

40
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.090
Those stores are never further out from that distribution center.

41
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.560
Then a human driven truck can drive back and forth in one day.

42
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.770
And so rather than the way,

43
00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:52.940
all of his competitors were doing it with sending trucks all over the place and

44
00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:57.710
having people sleep overnight and sort of making the trucking service fit

45
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.130
where they had, he designed the layout of the stores,

46
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.470
right. To fit what trucks could do. And so transportation and logistics,

47
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.190
right. Become Walmarts, you know, edge, right.

48
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:16.930
And allows them to dominate the space. That's the challenge that Amazon has now,

49
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:20.650
they've, they've mastered the digital part of it, right?

50
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:23.500
And now they got to figure out like, how do we, you know,

51
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.390
dominate the actual physical movement that compliments that,

52
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.880
um, others are obviously going to follow,

53
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.430
but the capabilities of these trucks is completely different than the

54
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:40.450
capability of human driven trucks. So if your Smith's packing right,

55
00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:42.730
and you've got, you know, uh,

56
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.950
a bunch of meat in a warehouse and it's going to grocery distribution centers,

57
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.851
you know,

58
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:53.170
you have that trucker probably come in the night before and you make them wait.

59
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.320
So they has, you know, a full 10 hour break,

60
00:03:56.321 --> 00:04:00.340
which is what the law requires so that he can get to the furthest reaches,

61
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.130
that he can have one of those stores, right.

62
00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:06.490
So he can drive his full 11 hours and, and bring that meat.

63
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:10.360
So it doesn't have to sit overnight in that refrigerated trailer. Right.

64
00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:11.920
And so their system is based on that.

65
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.600
Now what happens when that truck can now travel

66
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.000
two times as far, right?

67
00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:23.050
Three times as far now you don't need the warehouses where they were.

68
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.360
Now, you can go super lean with your inventory instead of having meet here,

69
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:32.590
meet there, meet there. You can put it all right here. And if it's cheap enough,

70
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.880
substitute those transportation costs for all that warehousing costs, right?

71
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.070
So this is going to remake landscapes in the same way that big

72
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.040
box supply chains did. Right. And then of course,

73
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:47.740
the further compliment of that is, you know,

74
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.750
how do you then get it to two people at their door, right. And,

75
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.160
you know, the big box supply chain,

76
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.840
it moves very few items in really large quantities

77
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.970
to very few locations, pretty slowly, right. Um,

78
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.800
e-commerce aspires, you know, to do something completely different, right. Move,

79
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.540
huge varieties of things in small quantities, virtually everywhere,

80
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.880
as fast as possible. Right. Um,

81
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.710
and so that is like that intercity trucking under

82
00:05:20.711 --> 00:05:25.180
the, you know, in the era of, of railroad monopolies, right.

83
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.010
The demand for that is potentially enormous. Right. And, and that,

84
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.490
so there's, there is such a, so right now, I think a lot of the,

85
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.060
the business plans for sort of automated trucks, right.

86
00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:40.270
And sort of the way that the journalistic accounts portray it is like, okay,

87
00:05:40.271 --> 00:05:45.130
if we swap out a human for a computer, what are the labor costs per mile?

88
00:05:45.131 --> 00:05:47.650
And like, oh, here's the profitability of self-driving trucks.

89
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.130
Like this is transformative technology.

90
00:05:51.131 --> 00:05:53.650
We're going to change the way we get stuff.

91
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.260
So we can actually get a lot more trucks period with like the.

92
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.041
<v 0>Autonomous truck could,</v>

93
00:05:58.041 --> 00:06:01.700
because that would enable a very different kinds of transportation networks.

94
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:02.480
You think?

95
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.430
<v 1>Yeah. Here's and this is where it's like, oh, like, yeah.</v>

96
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.440
So we really thought we were going to be electrifying trucks if

97
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:16.040
they're going twice as far, if they're moving three times as much,

98
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.110
if they're going three times as far, right.

99
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.650
What does that mean for how far we are behind on batteries? Right.

100
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.160
We've got sort of these ideas about like, man, we, you know, here's how far,

101
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.170
how close we could get to meet this demand.

102
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.950
That demand is going to radically change. Right? These trucks are, you know,

103
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.600
so then we've got to think about, all right, if it's not batteries, you know,

104
00:06:35.601 --> 00:06:37.460
how are, how are we powering these things?

105
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.000
And how many of them are they're going to be like right now,

106
00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:45.830
we've got 5 million containers that move from LA and long beach to

107
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:48.320
Chicago on rail.

108
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.200
Rail is three or four times,

109
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:56.180
at least more efficient than trucks in terms of greenhouse gas

110
00:06:56.181 --> 00:07:00.620
emissions. And on that lane, it varies a lot depending on demand,

111
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:04.940
but maybe rail has a 20% advantage in cost, maybe 25%,

112
00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:06.230
but it's a couple of days slower.

113
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:11.870
So now you cut the cost of that truck transportation per mile, by 30%.

114
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.610
Now it's cheaper than rail and it gets the stuff there five days faster than

115
00:07:16.611 --> 00:07:21.290
rail. How many millions of containers are going to leave LA in long beach,

116
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.870
on self-driving trucks and go to Chicago and.

117
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.790
<v 0>Look very much like a train. If, if we go with a platooning solution,</v>

118
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.810
uh, you have these rows of like,

119
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:37.850
imagine like rows of like 10, like dozens of trucks or like hundreds of trucks,

120
00:07:37.851 --> 00:07:42.350
like some absurd situation just going from LA to Chicago.

121
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:47.930
Yeah. Just this train, but taking up a highway. I mean, um,

122
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:52.070
I, this is probably a good place to talk about various scenarios.

123
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.130
<v 1>But before we get there, can I, can I just make one,</v>

124
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:59.630
one interesting observation that I made as a driver, um,

125
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.820
when you're in a truck you're up higher, you know, so you can,

126
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:06.560
you can see further and you can see the traffic patterns and, um,

127
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:11.150
cars move in packs. Um, I'm sure there's academic research on this. Right.

128
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.200
But they move in packs.

129
00:08:12.201 --> 00:08:16.070
They kind of bunch up behind a slower car and then a bunch of break free.

130
00:08:16.071 --> 00:08:18.740
And this is sort of on almost free-flowing highways.

131
00:08:18.741 --> 00:08:22.820
They kind of move in packs and you can kind of see them in the truck. So,

132
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:26.660
you know, rather than platoons, we might have like hives, you know, of trucks,

133
00:08:26.661 --> 00:08:30.770
right? So you have like 20 trucks moving in some coordinated fashion, right.

134
00:08:30.771 --> 00:08:33.290
And then maybe the self-driving cars are, you know,

135
00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:35.960
cause people don't like to be around them or whatever it is. Right.

136
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.700
You might have a pot of, you know,

137
00:08:37.701 --> 00:08:41.120
20 self-driving cars sort of moving in a packet behind them. You know,

138
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:41.900
this is what.

139
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.550
<v 0>If the aliens came down or we're just observing cars, which is one of the,</v>

140
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:51.350
uh, sort of prevalent characteristics of human civilization is there seems to be

141
00:08:51.351 --> 00:08:55.830
these cars, like moving around that would do this kind of analysis, like, huh.

142
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.670
What's the interesting clustering of situations here, uh,

143
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.330
especially with autonomous vehicles, uh, I like this.
