1
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.400
<v 0>The other thing would be if a completely superior design</v>

2
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.920
for a new sort of state independent monetary system emerged,

3
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.080
but it's really hard to even imagine how that would come to emerge.

4
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.160
And there's good reasons to think that Bitcoin, uh,

5
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.230
the Condit as of its launch were extremely favorable and hard to replicate.

6
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.790
<v 1>Can you speak to some of those conditions? Why it's a unique, uh, timing wise,</v>

7
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.590
uh, moment for Bitcoin to emerge?

8
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.390
<v 0>Yeah, so obviously Bitcoin was born in the depths of the financial crisis,</v>

9
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.270
which gives it a nice, nice historical element,

10
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.660
but that was kind of a coincidence. Honestly,

11
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:50.660
we know that Satoshi had been working on it earlier in back or in 2017.

12
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.980
Um, the really special thing about Bitcoin was that it was launched anonymously

13
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.820
by an entity that did not seek any glory or credit for what they did and

14
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.860
apparently never monetized it at all.

15
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.130
So they never really moved any of their coins.

16
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.570
Satoshi sent one test transaction to, uh,

17
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.010
Hal who's one of the earliest Bitcoiners, aside from that, as far as we know,

18
00:01:16.011 --> 00:01:17.690
Satoshi never spent any of their coins.

19
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.050
So you have this wonderful Promethian quality whereby it's almost self

20
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.290
sacrificial. I mean,

21
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.800
it's like this borderline godlike figure in terms of their restraint

22
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.280
finds this monetary technology and releases it to the world and pays the price.

23
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.880
They never took advantage of their filthy Lu, you know, they never,

24
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.320
they never recognize any of the $50 billion that they made from Bitcoin. Right.

25
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.790
Uh, and Satoshi also didn't assign themselves any privileged access,

26
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.150
uh, to the coins. You know, Satoshi could have just written in the code.

27
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.030
I own 10% of the coins, but they didn't, they just mined in the open,

28
00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.750
free market competition. Like everyone else.

29
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.150
It's just that Satoshi is a early minor to support the network,

30
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.470
accumulate a lot of coins for sure,

31
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.220
but they didn't have any privilege special access.

32
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.340
So that's one thing that's extremely special about the launch is that we had a

33
00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:17.940
founder that was truly committed to the monetary protocol and didn't seek either

34
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.220
recognition or financial spoils, and then also left, you know,

35
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.890
if Satoshi left in 20 10, 20 11, and hasn't really been heard from,

36
00:02:26.891 --> 00:02:27.970
since it's a.

37
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.930
<v 1>Very George Washington move gangster move where he didn't want power and once</v>

38
00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:37.170
he got power, he let go of it. Precisely. That was a key actually move.

39
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.050
That was, that was, uh,

40
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.610
probably one of the most important moves at the finding of this country.

41
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.770
<v 0>That's right. George Washington could have been a king, uh,</v>

42
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.840
probably if he'd won and Satoshi could have been, uh, Jerome Powell,

43
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.720
if he'd wanted and Satoshi could have held on to power indefinitely,

44
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.720
but chose to leave.

45
00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.280
The other thing is the Bitcoin circulated for a long period of time from

46
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.440
January, 2009 to about July,

47
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.600
2010 without really having a financial value.

48
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.440
So there weren't really any marketplaces, it didn't have a value.

49
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.080
And so that gave it this really great distribution, you know,

50
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.840
among a broad set of stakeholders.

51
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.830
And there were no venture funds or hedge funds, you know,

52
00:03:21.831 --> 00:03:24.590
trying to aggressively buy up all the supply back then.

53
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.390
Now when you have new cryptocurrencies launched,

54
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.470
they're like aggressively pre mind and some gigantic Silicon valley venture

55
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.590
fund is gonna own 30% of it.

56
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.470
And so it's sort of impossible to conceive of how that could become a global

57
00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:41.700
money because how could, you know,

58
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.460
a Silicon valley, uh, investment firm own 30% of the money supply.

59
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.060
That doesn't make sense. That's just so oligarchical, right?

60
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.140
It's unbelievable. So Bitcoin by contracts is a very bottom up thing.

61
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.210
It was the early enthusiasts people that were, you know,

62
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:04.210
really, um, excited about the technology.

63
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:06.850
They're the ones that obtained those early coins.

64
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.010
And so there was a real element of fairness and just an organic nature to its

65
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:14.890
launch, which would be incredibly hard to recapture today.

66
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.610
Let's say Satoshi came back and they said, okay,

67
00:04:19.611 --> 00:04:21.760
I made by a coin 2.0, I'm gonna release it.

68
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.840
There'd be the most aggressive land grab ever by, you know,

69
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.760
gigantic pools of capital to sort of get favorable allocations

70
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.280
of the new system, right?

71
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.080
<v 1>Can, uh, Satoshi with Bitcoin 2.0, build in, uh,</v>

72
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.430
a resistance mechanism or venture mechanism for the land grab.

73
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.390
<v 0>It would be hard to, because, you know, if you have capital and resources,</v>

74
00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.150
I mean, if it was a proof of work chain,

75
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.230
you'd just have people that would invest a ton of money in mining, for instance.

76
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.550
But most new blockchains cryptocurrencies are just sold basically they're,

77
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.430
you know, issued in token offerings kind of thing. So.

78
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.740
<v 1>So it's hard to enforce through the protocol,</v>

79
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.100
the exist centralization of control.

80
00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.060
<v 0>Yeah, power. It'd be challenging too. And people have tried to do airdrops,</v>

81
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.380
you know, where they, you know,

82
00:05:12.381 --> 00:05:14.980
distribute coins to a large number of people basically doesn't work.

83
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.060
Most people don't care about the airdrop.

84
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.460
So it's hard to have an equitable distribution.

85
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.290
I think conditions of Bitcoin's launch were so lucky and favorable

86
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.970
that they're very unlikely to be replicated.

87
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.770
So I do think it's gonna be real challenge to ever have a new competitor that's

88
00:05:33.771 --> 00:05:35.850
as decentralized, as leaderless,

89
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.170
as dispersed sort of distributed as Bitcoin is, has its credibility.

90
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.240
I don't know how you could overrule it on those important features.
