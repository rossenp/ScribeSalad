00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.180
<v 0>You mentioned that you used to do research at night and go to bed at like 6:00</v>

2
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.940
AM or 7:00 AM I still do that often? Um,

3
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.900
what, uh, sleep schedules have you tried to make for productive and happy life?

4
00:00:16.901 --> 00:00:18.500
Like, is there, um,

5
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.330
is there some interesting wild sleeping patterns that you engaged that you

6
00:00:23.331 --> 00:00:24.690
found that works really well for you?

7
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.410
<v 1>I tried at some point decreasing number of hours of sleep.</v>

8
00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:33.210
Like I gradually like a half an hour, every few days less, you know,

9
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.170
I was hoping to just save time that clearly didn't work for me.

10
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.970
Like at some point there's like a phase shift and I felt tired all the time.

11
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.440
<v 2>You know, there was a time that I used to work during the nights,</v>

12
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.920
the nights think about the nights is that no one disturbs you. And, um,

13
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.840
even I remember when I was meeting for the first time with,

14
00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.920
uh, Greg Brockman, his CTO and chairman of open AI,

15
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.350
our meeting was scheduled to 5:00 PM and overstep for the meeting.

16
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:06.420
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

17
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.070
<v 0>Overslept for the meeting. Yeah. At 5:00 PM. Yeah. Now you sound like me.</v>

18
00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:10.904
That's hilarious.

19
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.470
<v 1>Okay. Yeah. And, uh, at that moment, in some sense, uh,</v>

20
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.990
my sleeping schedule also has to do with the fact that I'm interacting with

21
00:01:19.991 --> 00:01:23.270
people. I sleep without an alarm. So.

22
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.780
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; so yeah, the, the team thing, you mentioned extrovert thing,</v>

23
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.100
because most humans operate during a certain set of hours.

24
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.860
You're forced to then operate at the same set of hours, but

25
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.820
I'm not quite there yet.

26
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.740
<v 2>I found a lot of joy, just like you said,</v>

27
00:01:42.741 --> 00:01:47.690
working through the night because it's quiet because the world doesn't disturb

28
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:52.410
you and there's some aspect counter to everything you're saying there's some

29
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.210
joyful aspect to sleeping through the mess of the day because, uh,

30
00:01:57.211 --> 00:02:01.170
people are having meetings and sending emails and there's drama meetings.

31
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.970
I can sleep through all the.

32
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:03.930
<v 1>Meetings. You know,</v>

33
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.920
I have meetings every day and they prevent me from having sufficient amount of

34
00:02:07.921 --> 00:02:11.320
time for, uh, focus, work mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. And, uh,

35
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.400
then I modified my calendar and I said that I'm out of office Wednesday,

36
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.640
Thursday, and Friday every day.

37
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.920
<v 2>And I'm having meetings only Monday and Tuesday. And that bus,</v>

38
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.030
the positively influence my mood that I like at three days for fully

39
00:02:28.031 --> 00:02:29.230
focused work. Yeah.

40
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.870
<v 0>So there's better solutions to this problem than staying awake all night.</v>
