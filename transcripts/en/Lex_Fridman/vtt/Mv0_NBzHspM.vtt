00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.030
<v 0>Is there an, a science, is there an art to cooking meat? Well,</v>

2
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.430
and the different kinds of meats,

3
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.870
is there something you can convert towards &lt;laugh&gt; in, um,

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.150
to say ideas, how, how to bring, uh, out the best of,

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.030
out of what particular meat, whatever steak we're talking about,

6
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.820
whatever it be we're talking about. Is there something that could be said, the.

7
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.020
<v 1>Basic approach to cooking any type of meat</v>

8
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.980
beyond the artistry of it is pretty scientific and it's what

9
00:00:33.981 --> 00:00:38.500
type of muscle is it in the animal and what's the surface area to volume ratio.

10
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.850
&lt;laugh&gt; okay. So let's look at those two questions. So the first pieces,

11
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.410
what's the type of muscle in the animal. What's the functionality.

12
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.810
You don't necessarily need to know that, um, to evaluate it,

13
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:51.890
but you need to understand,

14
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.890
is it a tender muscle that's not used very frequently in the animal or is it a

15
00:00:55.891 --> 00:00:58.850
big load bearing muscle that gets a lot of action, like cheek, right?

16
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.730
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; or the shin or the, those pieces.

17
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.970
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; the muscles like, uh,

18
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.120
those along the spinal cord that make up rib revises in New York steaks and

19
00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:08.201
things.

20
00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:11.480
Those aren't very exercised they're they're right next to the spinal cord

21
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.320
spinal. Cord's doing most of the work there. They're kind of like, um,

22
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.320
stabilizing muscles around this big functional piece of,

23
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.680
of skeletal structure in the animal.

24
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.680
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; other muscles like the ones around the diaphragm with the

25
00:01:23.681 --> 00:01:25.790
flat iron steaks or at stakes and things. Those are,

26
00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:29.310
those are really functional muscles that are doing a ton and moving and the,

27
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.110
if they're moving a lot, what happens? Well, functionally,

28
00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:38.030
they've got lots of muscle sheaths because muscles that move frequently have to

29
00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:41.270
do a lot of like complex contraction. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, that's why,

30
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.430
you know, there's um, in the cheek, for example,

31
00:01:44.431 --> 00:01:48.660
there's tons of visible fiber of like collagenous connective tissue.

32
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.420
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that connective tissue is everything

33
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.380
in how the meat cooks because connective tissue doesn't respond to

34
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.860
high heat with becoming more tender muscles, do, right.

35
00:02:01.861 --> 00:02:03.620
They can get a sea on them, you can cut them and eat them.

36
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.010
The collagenous tissue will GLM up and get really tough.

37
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.050
So you either have to liquefy it with really low, slow heat with moisture,

38
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.450
right. Um,

39
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.690
or you have to barely cook it and that's so that's the major piece.

40
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.531
So that's the question of like,

41
00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:21.050
why wouldn't you just throw brisket on the grill? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; okay.

42
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.810
It's not about the fat. You can cut the fat out.

43
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.730
The reason you're not gonna throw brisket on the grill and cook it hot and fast

44
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.040
is too much. Collagenous connective tissue in it.

45
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.280
Those are these giant muscles that have all this collagen and these fibers and

46
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:33.320
tendons in them effectively.

47
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.320
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so you're never gonna be able to just cook that up hot,

48
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.240
fast that, so that's the first piece. It's like what,

49
00:02:39.241 --> 00:02:41.600
where's this muscle in the architecture of the animal.

50
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.200
And then what does that mean for what's going on in the muscle?

51
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.390
And that's actually more important than fat content. We get really kind of,

52
00:02:51.391 --> 00:02:53.390
we pay a lot of attention to fat content in muscles.

53
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.470
You can make a steak tender if it doesn't have a ton of fat in it,

54
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.190
it actually has more to do if, if there's,

55
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.360
if there's collages and connective tissue in it.

56
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.680
<v 0>That's fascinating. I never even thought about that. I just,</v>

57
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.760
I thought it kind of, uh, universe, I mean, adds to the,

58
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.680
the texture of the meat, the chewiness of the meat,

59
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.920
but you're saying it's also adds to, uh, how heat, how it reacts to heat,

60
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.310
how the entirety of the meat react heat and the fat is not as important to that

61
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:22.790
as the, the collagen.

62
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.070
<v 1>The fat will make the flavor more delicious. Yes. Right?</v>

63
00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:28.990
Like it'll add unctuousness and mouth feel and things like that. But the,

64
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.350
all the connective tissue in meat and in some of the cuts like that,

65
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:33.510
we ate a skirt steak last night.

66
00:03:33.511 --> 00:03:37.590
You could see a web of that collagen sheath on the outside, on a rib.

67
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.060
That same collagen sheath is this big. There's only one.

68
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:42.380
It goes around the outside. Okay. Cuz that's just that muscle,

69
00:03:42.381 --> 00:03:46.980
there's one large muscle fiber. So that specific it's a,

70
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.460
it's a Milan sheath, right? That,

71
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.300
that material needs moisture and low and slow heat to become tender.

72
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.220
The other side of that is that when it becomes tender it electrifies and it adds

73
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.250
all this beautiful gelatinous consist. See that's what bone broth is.

74
00:04:01.251 --> 00:04:05.010
That's why a, like a, a slow cooked pork shoulder is so delicious.

75
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.250
It's not that it's full of all that fat. That fat's also great.

76
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.730
But a lot of that mouth feel comes from that really beautiful dissolved

77
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.890
collagen. So when you're looking at like,

78
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:18.290
how do I understand how I'm gonna cook a piece of meat that first fork in the

79
00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:22.720
road is how is this gonna receive bond to heat mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and what's

80
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.040
the appropriate cooking technique.

81
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.160
Then the second piece is that surface area to volume ratio.

82
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.160
And that's important because the heat is gonna impact the meat through the

83
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:35.920
surfaces of the meat that are in contact with the heat.

84
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.310
So if I have a steak, that's three is thick,

85
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.710
I'm gonna cook it extremely diff differently from a,

86
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.990
from a steak that's half inch thick mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; or three quarters of an

87
00:04:47.991 --> 00:04:50.870
inch thick. And that's the major of, and that's the truth.

88
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.550
If I have a piece of pork shoulder,

89
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.310
that's cut into cubes versus having a whole pork shoulder that serves area to

90
00:04:57.311 --> 00:04:59.870
volume ratio, that's gonna totally change how I cook it.

91
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.580
And same things like pot roast and a B stew would be the same cut of meat.

92
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.340
Right. But how I cook them is gonna change based on the surface area of volume.

93
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.140
Cause you've gotta let moisture and heat work its way into the center of the

94
00:05:13.141 --> 00:05:13.760
meat.

95
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.020
And that's gonna be determined by the amount of surface of the meat that's in

96
00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:18.900
contact with whatever cooking, liquid or heat.

97
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:19.680
<v 0>You've got.</v>

98
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.290
Is there different sources of heat play with like a big flame versus a,

99
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.210
a small, or maybe even like almost no flame, like over coals,

100
00:05:29.211 --> 00:05:29.950
all that kind of stuff.

101
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.690
Is there some science to the source of heat in how it plays with the meat.

102
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.410
<v 1>There's indirect heat and direct heat. Yeah.</v>

103
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.640
And that really is mostly about temperature. Okay. In more of than actual,

104
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.000
I mean, smoke is important as well, that can permeate,

105
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.720
but really the smoke doesn't go into the center.

106
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.600
If most cuts that you barbecue it'll come. It's like the smoke ring. It's,

107
00:05:50.601 --> 00:05:54.080
it's a, it's a, you know, it's maximum like half an inch on the outside,

108
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.320
maybe a little bit deeper on a really long slow cook. So they, but the,

109
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.560
the smoke that does create a ton of flavor on the surface of the meat mm-hmm

110
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.321
&lt;affirmative&gt;. Um, but that,

111
00:06:02.321 --> 00:06:06.320
so the indirect allows you to have smoke contacting it and then a very,

112
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:07.480
very low and slow heat.

113
00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.680
And what that does is indirect heat will be

114
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.750
low and slow enough that the center of the meat will get warm at the same time

115
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:18.830
as the exterior of the meat.

116
00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.710
And it'll all cook equally and all get equally tender.

117
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.030
If you go very hot and fast,

118
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.230
you risk the interior of the meat not getting right.

119
00:06:28.231 --> 00:06:30.710
You kind of create a shell on the, on it. Um,

120
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:32.310
and you slow down the interior of the meat,

121
00:06:32.311 --> 00:06:35.190
which you actually want to do with something like a steak where you wanna keep

122
00:06:35.191 --> 00:06:38.940
it rare on the inside. So it's really indirect versus direct.

123
00:06:38.941 --> 00:06:43.220
Then once you get into direct heat, right? Like in that category, there's wood,

124
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.220
charcoal, gas, right? That's about it.

125
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.620
And those are meaningfully different.

126
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.220
They're meaningfully different charcoal wood. That's more of,

127
00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:55.140
there's more poetry and wood. There's a little bit more flavor,

128
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.300
not functionally, very different,

129
00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.130
but gas versus charcoal wood is very different. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um,

130
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.810
and that's because of the actual scent of the, of the cook, right?

131
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.290
The scent of the flavor. Um, and then there's a,

132
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.090
I think an evenness of heat distribution that comes off of charcoal.

133
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.450
That's different from gas because no matter how awesome your gas grill is,

134
00:07:15.451 --> 00:07:17.250
you do have hotter and cooler spots.

135
00:07:17.251 --> 00:07:19.640
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so gas grills are typically,

136
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.800
you can kind of control for that. If you just are going really hot and fast.

137
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.560
Yeah. Which is why gas grills are fine.

138
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.600
If you're just like throwing that steak on getting a hard sea on those burgers,

139
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.880
put crus on it, gas fabulous than that. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, it's perfect.

140
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:34.760
When you're doing things that do better with a low and slow cook, um,

141
00:07:34.761 --> 00:07:37.720
like let's say a whole Tenderloin or chicken thigh.

142
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.710
That's gonna be a little bit less elegant on gas than on charcoal versus wood

143
00:07:42.711 --> 00:07:43.910
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. So when you have more,

144
00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:47.750
more kind of nuance in the low slow cook over the natural fuels.
