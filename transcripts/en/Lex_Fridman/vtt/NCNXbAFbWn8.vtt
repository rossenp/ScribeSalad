00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.440
<v 0>So let's talk about new MRI, which is an incredible company,</v>

2
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.810
uh, system idea, I think, but good place to start.

3
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.020
What is new Mariah and how does it work?

4
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.350
<v 1>So numerous, the first hedge fund that gives away all of its data.</v>

5
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.700
So this is like probably the last thing a hedge fund would do, right?

6
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.570
Why would we give away a data it's like giving away your edge? Um,

7
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.520
but the reason we do it is because we're looking for people to model our

8
00:00:34.521 --> 00:00:39.110
data and the way we do it is by Optus skating the data.

9
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.400
So when you get, when you look at numerous data that you can download for free,

10
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.170
it just looks like,

11
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.280
like a million rows and numbers between zero and one.

12
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.590
And you have no idea what the columns mean,

13
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.510
but you do know that if you're good at machine learning or have done

14
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.280
regressions before, you know that I can still find patents in this data,

15
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.010
even though I don't know, I don't know what the features mean.

16
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.770
<v 0>And, and the data itself is a time series data.</v>

17
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.820
And even though it's office created anonymized,

18
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.540
what is the source data like, approximately what are we talking about?

19
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.980
<v 1>So we are buying data from lots of different data vendors, um,</v>

20
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.210
and they would also never want us to share that data. Um,

21
00:01:23.211 --> 00:01:27.650
so we have strict contracts with them. So we only, we only can, but it,

22
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.850
but that's the kind of data you could never buy yourself unless you had maybe a

23
00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:34.940
million dollars a year of budget to buy data.

24
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.010
So what's happened with the hedge fund industry is you have a lot of talented

25
00:01:40.011 --> 00:01:43.910
people who used to be able to trade

26
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.680
and still can trade, but now they have such a data disadvantage.

27
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.120
It would never make sense for them to, um, to, to, to trade themselves.

28
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.320
But Numerai by giving away this obfuscated data, we can give them a really,

29
00:01:57.321 --> 00:02:01.670
really high quality dataset that's that would otherwise be very expensive and

30
00:02:01.671 --> 00:02:06.650
they can use whatever new machine learning technique they want, uh,

31
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.070
to find patterns in that data that we can use in our hedge fund.

32
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.140
<v 0>And so how much variety is there? The underlying data we're talking about of,</v>

33
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.750
I apologize if I'm using the wrong terms,

34
00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:20.210
but there's one is just like the stock price,

35
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.050
the other there's like options and all that kind of stuff. Like the,

36
00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:28.070
what are they called? Order books or whatever the, like I is,

37
00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:32.900
is there maybe other totally unrelated to directly to the stock

38
00:02:32.901 --> 00:02:37.790
market data? Like, like natural language as well, all that kind of stuff.

39
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.130
<v 1>Yeah. We were really focused on, um,</v>

40
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.150
stock data that's specific to stocks. So, um,

41
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.920
things like you can have like a P every stock has like a PE ratio for some

42
00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:52.010
stocks. It's not as meaningful, but every stock has that.

43
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.270
Every stock has one year momentum, how much they went up in the last year.

44
00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.850
Um, but those are very common factors,

45
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.040
but we try to get lots and lots of those factors that we have for many,

46
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:07.600
many years, like 15, 20 years history. Um, and,

47
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.610
and then the setup of the problem is commonly seen in quantum code.

48
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:16.580
Like cross-sectional global equity. You're not really trying to say, I want, I,

49
00:03:16.581 --> 00:03:19.900
I believe the stock will go up. You're trying to say, um,

50
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.520
the like relative position of this stock in feature space, uh,

51
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.030
makes it not a bad buy in, uh, in a portfolio.

52
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.700
<v 0>So it captures some period of time. And you're trying to find the patterns,</v>

53
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.410
the dynamics captured by the data of that period of time in order to make

54
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.390
short-term predictions about what's going to happen.

55
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.740
<v 1>Yeah. So our predictions also, not that short, we're not really, um,</v>

56
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.310
caring about things like order books and tick data, uh,

57
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.150
not high-frequency at all. We actually holding things for quite a bit longer.

58
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.210
Uh, so prediction time horizon is about one month.

59
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.060
We ended up holding stocks for maybe like three or four months.

60
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.340
So I kind of believe that's a little bit more like investing than, um,

61
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.030
than kind of plumbing, like to go long,

62
00:04:06.031 --> 00:04:10.800
a stock that's mispriced on one exchange and short on another exchange.

63
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.480
That's just arbitrage. But what we're trying to do is really no, no,

64
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.850
no. Something more about the longer-term future.

65
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.751
<v 0>The stock. Yeah.</v>

66
00:04:18.751 --> 00:04:23.670
So from the patterns from these like periods of a time series, did it,

67
00:04:23.671 --> 00:04:26.850
you're trying to understand something fundamental about the stock,

68
00:04:26.851 --> 00:04:29.910
not like about deep value,

69
00:04:29.911 --> 00:04:34.400
about like is big in the context of the market is under priced over priced,

70
00:04:34.401 --> 00:04:37.080
all that kind of stuff. So like, this is about investing.

71
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.830
It's not about just like you said, high frequency trading,

72
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.940
which I think is a fascinating open question for machine learning perspective,

73
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.890
but just to sort of build on that.

74
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.210
So you have anonymized the data and now you're giving away the data.

75
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.520
And then now anyone can try to,

76
00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.560
uh, build algorithms that make investing decisions on top of that data or

77
00:05:01.561 --> 00:05:05.370
predictions and the top of that data. Exactly. And so that that's, um,

78
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.840
what is it, so what does that look like? What's the goal that,

79
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.800
what are the underlying principles of that?

80
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.150
<v 1>So the first thing is, you know, we could obviously model that data in house,</v>

81
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.920
right? We can make an extra boost model on the data. Um,

82
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.870
and that would be quite good too. But what we're trying to do is by,

83
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.460
by, uh, opening it up and letting anybody participate, uh,

84
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.690
we can do quite a lot better than if we modeled it ourselves

85
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.480
and a lot better on the stock market.

86
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.070
It doesn't need to be very much like it really matters the difference between if

87
00:05:41.071 --> 00:05:46.020
you can make 10 and 12% in equity market neutral hedge fund, because the whole,

88
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.110
usually you're try, you're charging 2% fees.

89
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.910
So if you can do 2% better, that's like all your fees it's worth it.

90
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.460
So we're trying to make sure that we always have best possible model as new

91
00:05:58.461 --> 00:06:01.430
machine learning libraries come out, new new techniques come out,

92
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.440
they get automatically synthesized.

93
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:06.200
Like if there's a great paper on supervised learning,

94
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.920
someone on Numerai will figure out how to use it on numerous data.

95
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.050
<v 0>Is there an ensemble of, uh,</v>

96
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.600
models going on or is it always,

97
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.140
or is it more towards kind of like one or two or three,

98
00:06:20.141 --> 00:06:21.790
like best performing models?

99
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.400
<v 1>So the way we decide on how to weight,</v>

100
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.060
all of the predictions together is, um,

101
00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.430
by how much the users are staking on them,

102
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.960
how much of the cryptocurrency that they're putting behind their models.

103
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.210
So they're saying, I believe in my model,

104
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.950
tra you can trust me because I'm going to put skin in the game. Um,

105
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.610
and so we can take the stake weighted predictions from all our users,

106
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.700
add those together, average those together.

107
00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.560
And that's a much better model than any one model in the, in the sun,

108
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.800
because ensembling a lot of models together is kind of the key thing you need to

109
00:06:56.801 --> 00:06:58.000
do in investing to.

110
00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.430
<v 0>Yeah. So you're putting, there's a kind of duality from the user,</v>

111
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.740
from the perspective of machine learning engineer,

112
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.190
what you're is both a competition, just a really interesting,

113
00:07:09.191 --> 00:07:13.360
difficult machine learning problem. And it's, uh,

114
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.800
a way to, to invest algorithmically. So like you're, and,

115
00:07:17.801 --> 00:07:18.820
but the,

116
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.590
the way to invest algorithmically also is a way to put skin in the

117
00:07:23.591 --> 00:07:28.150
game that communicates to you that your, uh, the,

118
00:07:28.151 --> 00:07:32.800
the quality of the algorithm, and also forces you to really, uh,

119
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.700
be serious about the models that you build. So it's like,

120
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.910
everything just works nicely together. Like, um,

121
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.980
I guess one way to say that as the interests are aligned. Okay.

122
00:07:44.981 --> 00:07:48.250
So, uh, it's just like poker as not,

123
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:52.570
not fun when it's like for very low stakes, the higher the stakes,

124
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.620
the more the dynamics of the system starts playing out correctly. Uh,

125
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.780
like as a small side note,

126
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:03.790
is there something you can say about which kind looking at the

127
00:08:03.791 --> 00:08:06.850
big, broad view of machine learning today, or AI,

128
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.070
what kind of algorithms seem to do good in these kinds of

129
00:08:12.071 --> 00:08:16.690
competitions at this time? Is there some universal thing you can say,

130
00:08:16.691 --> 00:08:21.520
like neural networks suck a recurring y'all know our SOC transformers suck or

131
00:08:21.521 --> 00:08:22.570
they're awesome.

132
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:27.790
Like old school sort of more basic kind of classifiers are better. All the Xer.

133
00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.850
Is there some kind of conclusion so far that you can say, okay.

134
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.870
<v 1>There definitely is something pretty nice about tree models, uh, like,</v>

135
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:38.290
like XG boost, um, and, uh,

136
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.560
they just seem to work pretty nicely on this type of data. Uh,

137
00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:42.970
so out of the box,

138
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:47.860
if you're trying to come hundredth in the competition in the tournament,

139
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:52.090
maybe you would try and use that. Um, but what's,

140
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:57.060
what's particularly interesting about the, the problem that, um,

141
00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:01.350
not many people understand if you're familiar with machine learning, um,

142
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.120
this typically will surprise you when you model all data. So, um,

143
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.430
one of the things that, uh,

144
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:14.220
you look at in finance is you don't want to be too exposed to any one risk.

145
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.830
Like even if the best sector in

146
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:24.750
the world to invest in over the last 10 years was tech, you would not,

147
00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:28.200
does not mean you should put all your money into tech, right? So the,

148
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.680
if you train the model, it would say put all your money in tech. Super good.

149
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:33.360
But, um,

150
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.950
what you want to do is actually be very careful of how much of this exposure you

151
00:09:37.951 --> 00:09:41.820
have to certain features. So on numerate,

152
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.900
what a lot of people figure out is actually,

153
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.420
if you train a model on this kind of data,

154
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:53.370
you want to somehow neutralize or minimize your exposure to these certain

155
00:09:53.371 --> 00:09:57.480
features, which is unusual because if, if you did train, um,

156
00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.490
a stoplight or stop street, uh, detection, uh, on computer vision,

157
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:07.350
uh, the, your, your favorite feature, let's say you could,

158
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.390
and you have an auto encoder and it's figuring out, okay,

159
00:10:09.391 --> 00:10:14.070
it's gotta be red and it's gotta be white. That's the last thing you want to be.

160
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:18.330
You want to reduce your exposure to why would you reduce the exposure to the

161
00:10:18.331 --> 00:10:20.550
thing that's helping you, your model the most.

162
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.180
And that's actually this counter-intuitive thing you have to do with machine

163
00:10:24.181 --> 00:10:25.110
learning on financial data.

164
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:30.140
<v 0>So reducing it's reducing your exposure would help you generalize the things</v>

165
00:10:30.141 --> 00:10:30.920
that are.

166
00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.600
So basically financial data has a large amount of

167
00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:37.730
patterns that appeared in the past,

168
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.300
and also a large amount of patterns that have not appeared in the past.

169
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.610
And so like, in that sense, you have to reduce the exposure to red lights, uh,

170
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.880
to, to the color red. That's interesting,

171
00:10:49.881 --> 00:10:53.810
but how much of this is art and how much of it is science from your perspective

172
00:10:53.811 --> 00:10:56.720
so far in terms of,

173
00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:01.670
as you start to climb from the hundredth position to the 95th in the

174
00:11:01.671 --> 00:11:02.504
competition?

175
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.553
<v 1>Yeah. Well,</v>

176
00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.390
if you do make yourself super exposed to a one or

177
00:11:08.391 --> 00:11:09.290
two features,

178
00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.550
you can have a lot of volatility when you're playing new MRI.

179
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:18.620
You could maybe very rapidly rise to be high if you were

180
00:11:18.621 --> 00:11:23.480
getting lucky. Yes. And that's a bit like the stock market. Sure.

181
00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.520
Take on massive risk exposure,

182
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:29.930
put all your money into one stock and you might make a hundred percent,

183
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:35.240
but, um, it doesn't in the long run workout very well. And so,

184
00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:37.700
um, the best users are,

185
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.680
are trying to stay high for as long as possible on

186
00:11:42.681 --> 00:11:46.370
not, not necessarily try to be thirst for a little bit.
