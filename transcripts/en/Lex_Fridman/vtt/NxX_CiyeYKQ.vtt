1
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.800
<v 0>I spent my entire adult life trying to help people give of myself</v>

2
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.830
and I can't even get my medical bill paid. Well,

3
00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:12.480
John field got my medical bill paid.

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.480
He finally got these politicians with his team.

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.780
Firefighter reefer who's since died,

6
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.000
fought with terminal cancer for nine years in a wheelchair.

7
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.760
Literally at the end,

8
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.940
came out of hospice to go finalize getting us this coverage.

9
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.520
Detective Luis Alvarez,

10
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.630
who testified days before he died in front of Congress

11
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.670
and a bunch of other guys that were really, really sick.

12
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.430
And we had to shame these people into signing on.

13
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.090
And luckily we had Jon Stewart come on and literally just,

14
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:51.930
just hound these guys and, and shame them and embarrass them.

15
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.100
And what it all stemmed from was in 2006,

16
00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.660
the first death that was determined to be linked to nine 11,

17
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.441
there was others.

18
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:05.100
But the first one that was officially linked was a New York city police

19
00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:09.420
detective, who initially the city said he died of advanced lung disease.

20
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.440
His lungs were protruding out of his body and he was on painkillers.

21
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.500
And it was so bad at the end that the doctor said, just grind them up,

22
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.280
snort them, drink it, whatever you need to do to get instant relief.

23
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.230
So when they found the talcum from the pill lining in his lungs, they said,

24
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.440
oh no, this is opiate abuse. You didn't, he didn't die of lung disease.

25
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.840
So they said, and the mayor, it was quoted as saying he is not a hero. Well,

26
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:35.340
shame on you, Mr. Mayor.

27
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.600
He was a hero and his father who was a retired police chief,

28
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.090
married up with the feel-good foundation and John Stewart and Ray Pfeiffer,

29
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.410
detective Alvarez. And they got us all covered,

30
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.950
but it took so long. Lexi was so heartbreaking.

31
00:01:52.951 --> 00:01:56.730
These people who were lining up three deep politicians,

32
00:01:56.731 --> 00:02:01.320
three deep to catch a picture with a responder so they can tweet hashtag never

33
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:06.270
forget and hashtag look at me and Hey, how am I doing all that bull crap?

34
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.330
But they did not. They were nowhere to be freaking found. I physically,

35
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.570
I literally witnessed them hiding in cloak rooms,

36
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.590
running down hallways away from us, those freaking cowards that's cowardice.

37
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.220
<v 1>W can I just linger on the Jon Stewart thing, that comedian actor, John Stewart,</v>

38
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.570
uh,

39
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.680
his testimony before Congress over the benefits for nine 11 first responders.

40
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.820
I mean, there's a lot of important human beings in this story,

41
00:02:30.821 --> 00:02:34.990
but he has a big voice and he spoke from the heart.

42
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.490
What do you make of that testimony?

43
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.860
<v 0>Oh, it was heartfelt. I mean he spoke, look, I mean,</v>

44
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.670
John, John was a, you know, a polarizing guy, right?

45
00:02:45.671 --> 00:02:49.060
There's certain things like over the years he was cutting edge and I might not

46
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.420
have agree with all of his. Oh yeah. You know, well, you know, some stuff,

47
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.950
you know, like we all, but I'll tell you. I found him as funny. I,

48
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.070
I enjoyed his humor.

49
00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.770
<v 1>I would love the two to you to a conversation.</v>

50
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.470
<v 0>But again, I love a guy where you can have,</v>

51
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.970
you can have a difference in opinion.

52
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.130
That's the beautiful thing about the firehouse kitchen. I mean,

53
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:08.830
it could get raucous and LA and now I don't know,

54
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.190
it's a little different situation, but I mean, back in the day,

55
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.150
some funny stuff, but yeah, John, John literally just took his talents.

56
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.340
You would think he was speaking from the heart of a fireman or a cop or soldier

57
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:23.560
or a Marine or, you know, someone who was there.

58
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.260
But I think he especially got to know Ray so well.

59
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.390
And Ray had this stack of mass cards from the funeral

60
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:37.120
cards they give out, it looks like, you know,

61
00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:41.710
a larger business card that's laminated. And Ray had a stack of them.

62
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:44.470
He would carry around. I think it was close to a hundred cards

63
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.200
and John saw it and he said, what's that? He says, these are my cards. He said,

64
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.610
for what he says for my brother's funerals, he was like, oh my God,

65
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:58.200
you've been to that many funerals. He goes, yeah, this,

66
00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.630
this is just the ones I made. Like, like, you know,

67
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.430
and John I think was, was just stunned. And I,

68
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.050
John actually had that stack of cards after, after Ray passed and like said,

69
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:14.500
look, look at these look, there's going to be more of these cards.

70
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.020
We have one guy a week or girl, one responder or,

71
00:04:19.021 --> 00:04:22.330
or recovery worker or someone who actually resided down there.

72
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.790
There's more than one a week dying.

73
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.440
It's one a day dying on average. And on average,

74
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.330
two people are diagnosed with a nine 11 cancer or disease right

75
00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:38.710
now the S the worst part is there's autoimmune diseases flying off the graph.

76
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.060
And you're not covered under the legislation by the grace of God.

77
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.480
My cancer was covered. If, if my, if my cancer comes back, I mean,

78
00:04:46.481 --> 00:04:49.000
I'm in remission, technically incurable, but, um,

79
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.060
I've been blessed them staying ahead of this stuff going on 10 years.

80
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.710
But if it comes back with a vengeance tomorrow and takes me, you know,

81
00:04:56.711 --> 00:04:57.170
at least my,

82
00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.730
my wife will get my pension and be able to live her life without fear.

83
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.500
But my friends who were suffering from these advanced autoimmunes their wives

84
00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:10.330
get nothing. Their pension dies with them. And we're hoping that,

85
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.700
that, you know, John and his army can,

86
00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:15.820
can shame these politicians once again,

87
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.800
to have the kindness and decency to cover these. Autoimmunes, you know,

88
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.190
they're throwing a lot of money around that, a lot of things lately,

89
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.060
and this is one that they want. And,

90
00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:31.180
and these are the lives in the balance who really need it. And John had this.

91
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.760
<v 1>Strong line, they did their jobs, do yours,</v>

92
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.720
talking to the politicians. Yeah. And it,

93
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.010
it's a strong wake up call that, um,

94
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.760
it's not about the Twitter or the social media or all that kind of stuff.

95
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.740
It's you have a job to do. And you have to it's that compassion,

96
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.850
uh,

97
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.850
implementing form of money of helping people that were there for you when

98
00:05:58.851 --> 00:05:59.684
you needed help.

99
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.710
<v 0>Well, we had a guy, I mean, I might get audited out of this one. I hope not.</v>

100
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:07.220
But we had a Congressman from out west. I won't say where,

101
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:12.060
but he prided himself on saying he was a retired cop, busy cop,

102
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.100
22 years. He said, no, on the legislation,

103
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.380
I witnessed a cop, who's dying. Get out of his wheelchair and said,

104
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:25.790
Hey brother, I got a half a million dollars in medical bills.

105
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:26.900
And I'm a short time.

106
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.290
Or I got a few months to live who the AF is going to pay him,

107
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.190
do the right thing. You say, you're a cop. You show me you're a cop.

108
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:35.510
And you sign that paper.

109
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.020
And the guy started tearing up the congressmen and he signed it,

110
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.080
but he had to be freaking shame. And you know what he said, well,

111
00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:44.330
this doesn't really confront me. This is poor.

112
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.030
As far as my district's concerned, he goes, oh yeah.

113
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.660
Do you notice 10 guys from your district who came across the country to help us

114
00:06:50.661 --> 00:06:54.620
that are also dying? Get no idea. He had no idea.

115
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.560
And that's the sad part about Alexa? There's, there's,

116
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.030
it's a failure in leadership, you know? I mean,

117
00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:05.480
I think some people would vote for Mickey mouse just cause if you ran, I mean,

118
00:07:05.481 --> 00:07:08.210
I, no offense against Mickey mouse. I like him. He's a good guy. Right? I mean,

119
00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:12.890
but like, like allegedly, supposedly. Yeah. You know, but seriously,

120
00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:16.340
like I, he has look at,

121
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.250
I look at someone of leadership sometimes and go true.

122
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.360
<v 1>And also you lose, uh, I think the way government is structured is,</v>

123
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.120
um, people who are senators or, um, uh, people who are in Congress, they,

124
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.830
they start playing game between each other and they lose track of the connection

125
00:07:33.831 --> 00:07:37.670
to the, to the, to the people, to basic humanity. You forget,

126
00:07:37.671 --> 00:07:40.340
even when you think of yourself as a cop, uh,

127
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:44.480
you forget what are like the cops. Uh, and, uh,

128
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.110
the other people, uh, servicing the community,

129
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.420
actually experiencing all the troubles they're going through and how they can

130
00:07:50.421 --> 00:07:53.330
actually be helped because you lose touch with that because you're not actually

131
00:07:53.331 --> 00:07:56.840
living. You're not talking to them, y'all living among them. And I mean,

132
00:07:56.841 --> 00:07:58.430
that's a natural part of the system,

133
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.750
but I think that's why character and great leadership was important. As you say,

134
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:08.120
you leave the game of Congress and you go back to the people. Um,

135
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.730
I mean, that's what the, the country, you know,

136
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:15.560
it's like the George Washington ideal is you're not playing the game of power.

137
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:19.340
You're ultimately see yourself as somebody who's servicing this country,

138
00:08:19.341 --> 00:08:20.420
servicing the community.

139
00:08:20.421 --> 00:08:24.110
And that requires talking to the people in their time of hardship.
