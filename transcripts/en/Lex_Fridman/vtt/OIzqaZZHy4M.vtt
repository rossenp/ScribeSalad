1
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.150
<v 0>If we look at the cleanest formulation of that,</v>

2
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.230
of looking at a problem from different perspective,

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.630
you are also involved with the international mathematics Olympian, which takes,

4
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.750
uh, small, clean, uh,

5
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.590
problems that are really hard.

6
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.380
But once you look at them differently can become easy.

7
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.900
But that little jump of innovation is a, is, uh, is,

8
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.700
is the entire trick. So maybe at the high level, can you say,

9
00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:34.540
what is the international mathematical Olympian? Sure.

10
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.500
<v 1>So this is, uh, uh, the competition for people who aren't yet in college, uh,</v>

11
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.940
math competition, which is the most prestigious one in the entire world.

12
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.490
It's the Olympics of mathematics. Uh,

13
00:00:45.491 --> 00:00:47.970
but only for people who aren't yet in college. Now,

14
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.090
the kinds of questions that they ask you to do are not computational.

15
00:00:52.091 --> 00:00:56.170
Usually you're not supposed to find that the answer is 42. &lt;laugh&gt; right.

16
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.970
Instead, you're supposed to explain why something is true. Yes. And the, the,

17
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.770
the problem is that at the beginning, when you look at each of the questions,

18
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.240
first of all, you have four and a half hours to solve three questions,

19
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.640
and this is one day. And then you have a second day,

20
00:01:09.641 --> 00:01:11.720
which is four and a half hours, three questions.

21
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.160
But when you look at the questions, they're all asking you,

22
00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:17.040
explain why the following thing is true, which you've never seen before.

23
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.880
And by the way, even though there are six questions,

24
00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:22.800
if you solve any one of them, you're a genius and you get an honorable mention.

25
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.630
So this is, this is hard, really hard problem. So really.

26
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.270
<v 0>What about, is it one person? Is it a team? Ah.</v>

27
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.910
<v 1>So it's, each country can send six people.</v>

28
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.830
And the score of the country is actually unofficial.

29
00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:37.830
There's not an official country versus country system.

30
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.390
Although everyone just adds up the point scores of the six people and they say,

31
00:01:41.391 --> 00:01:43.350
well, now, which country, uh, stacked up where?

32
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.260
<v 0>Yeah. So be as a side comment, I should say that, um,</v>

33
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.500
there's a bunch of countries, including the former Soviet union and Russia, uh,

34
00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:57.300
where I grew up where this is one of the most

35
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.660
important competitions that the country participates in.

36
00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:04.740
Like it was a source of pride for a lot of the country. You,

37
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.570
you look at the Olympic sports, like, uh, wrestling, weight, lifting,

38
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.130
there's certain sports and hockey that Russia

39
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.050
and the Soviet union truly took pride in.

40
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.170
And actually the mathematical Olympia,

41
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.050
it was one of them for many years is still one of them. And that's kind of fast,

42
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.080
Cindy. We don't think about it this way in, in the United States.

43
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.840
Maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong,

44
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.720
but it's not nearly as popular in the United States in terms of

45
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.080
its integration into the culture, into, uh,

46
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.920
just basic conversation into the pride. Like, you know,

47
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.160
if you win an Olympic gold medal or if you win the super bowl,

48
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.670
walk around proud.

49
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.230
I think that was the case with the mathematical Olympian in Russia. Not,

50
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.910
not as much the case in the United States. I think. So.

51
00:02:55.911 --> 00:03:00.440
I just wanna give that a little aside because beating anybody from Russia from

52
00:03:00.441 --> 00:03:04.440
the Eastern Republic or from China is very, very difficult there.

53
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.160
Like if I remember correctly, you know, there's people,

54
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.080
this was a multi-year training process.

55
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.880
They train hard and this is,

56
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.190
this is everything that they're focused on. My, uh, my dad was,

57
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.150
was, uh, was a participant in this and it's, I mean, it's, uh,

58
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.190
it's as serious as Olympic sports, you think about like gymnastics,

59
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:30.670
like young athletes participating gymnastics is, is as serious as that,

60
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:33.790
if not more serious. So I just wanna give that a little bit of context,

61
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.030
cause we're talking about serious high level math.

62
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.950
&lt;laugh&gt; athletics almost here you.

63
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.500
<v 1>Yeah. And actually, I also think that it made sense, uh,</v>

64
00:03:42.501 --> 00:03:43.940
from the Soviet union's perspective,

65
00:03:43.941 --> 00:03:47.300
because if you look at what these people do eventually,

66
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.940
even though let's look at the SSRS Oly, uh, international math Olympia record,

67
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.460
even though they, I say,

68
00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:57.460
even though they won a lot of awards at the high school thing,

69
00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.330
many of them went on to do credible things in research mathematics or research

70
00:04:02.331 --> 00:04:03.164
other things,

71
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.730
and that's showing the generalization generalizability of what they were working

72
00:04:07.731 --> 00:04:12.130
on because ultimately we're just playing with

73
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.090
ideas of how to prove things mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

74
00:04:15.091 --> 00:04:19.970
And if you get pretty good at inventing creative ways to turn problems of

75
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.200
part, split them apart, observe neat ways to, um,

76
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.000
turn messy things into simple crystals. Well,

77
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.440
if you're gonna try to solve any real problem in the real world,

78
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.360
that could be a really handy tool too. So I don't think it was a bad investment.

79
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.720
I, I think it clearly it worked well for Soviet union.
