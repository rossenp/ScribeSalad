00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.520
<v 0>What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing of life?</v>

2
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.680
Why the hell are we here? Ryan Johnson,

3
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.560
we've been talking about brains and studying brains,

4
00:00:12.561 --> 00:00:16.680
and you had this very eloquent way of describing life on earth as, uh,

5
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.120
as an optimization problem, uh, of, uh,

6
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.390
the cost of intelligence going to zero at first through the evolutionary

7
00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:28.510
process. And then eventually through building, um,

8
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.190
through our technology building more and more intelligence systems you ever

9
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.950
ask yourself? Why is doing that?

10
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.910
<v 1>Yeah, I think the answer to this question again,</v>

11
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.620
the information value is more in the mirror.

12
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.380
It provides of that person,

13
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.500
which is a representation of the technological social,

14
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.740
political context of the time.

15
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.220
So if you asked this question a hundred years ago,

16
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.980
you would get a certain answer that reflects that time period,

17
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.820
same thing with two over a thousand years ago, it's rare.

18
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.120
It's difficult for a person to pull themselves outta their contextual awareness.

19
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.680
Yeah, very true and offer truly original response.

20
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.240
And so knowing that I am contextually influenced by the situation that I am

21
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.000
a mirror for our reality, I would say that in this moment,

22
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.160
I think the real game going on

23
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.493
is

24
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.800
that in evolution built a system of scaffolding

25
00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:34.560
intelligence that produced us.

26
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.920
We are now building intelligence systems that are scaffolding,

27
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.830
higher dimensional intelligence. Uh,

28
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.110
it's developing more robust systems of inte

29
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.300
in doing in that process with the cost going to zero.

30
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.380
Then the meaning of life becomes goal alignment,

31
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.660
which is the negotiation of our conscious and unconscious existence.

32
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.810
And then I'd say the third thing is if we're thinking that we wanna be explorers

33
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.570
is our technological progress is getting to a point where

34
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.210
we could aspirationally say,

35
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.570
we want to figure out what is really going on really going on

36
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.600
because does any of this really make sense? Now we may be a hundred, 200, 500,

37
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.680
a thousand years away from being able to poke our way out of

38
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.080
whatever is, is going on.

39
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.800
But it's interesting that we could even state an aspiration to say,

40
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.040
we wanna poke at this question, but I'd say in this moment of time,

41
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.710
the in need of life is that we can build a future state

42
00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.000
of existence that is more fantastic than anything we could ever imagine.

43
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.720
The.

44
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.720
<v 0>Striving for something more amazing.</v>

45
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.810
<v 1>And that defies expectations that</v>

46
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.370
we would consider bewildering and all the things that,

47
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.840
that that's. And, and, and I guess the last thing &lt;laugh&gt;,

48
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.760
if there's multiple meetings of life, it would be infinite games. You know,

49
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:27.320
James cars wrote the book, finite games, infinite games,

50
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.400
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; the only game to play right now is to keep playing the

51
00:03:32.401 --> 00:03:37.400
game. And so this goes back to the algorithm of the L algorithm of diet,

52
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.990
soda, and brisket pursuing the passion. I'm what I'm suggesting is there is a,

53
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.630
there's a moment here where we can contemplate playing infinite games.

54
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.550
Therefore it may make sense to err,

55
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.030
on the side of making sure one is in a situation to be playing infinite games,

56
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.950
if that opportunity arises.

57
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.510
So it just the landscape of possibilities changing very, very fast and,

58
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.860
and therefore our old algorithms of how we might assess risk assessment and what

59
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:06.540
things we might pursue and why those assumptions may fall away very quickly.

60
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.220
<v 0>Well, I think I speak for a lot of people when I say that the game you</v>

61
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.820
Mr. Brian Johnson have been playing is quite incredible. Thank you so much.

62
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.860
<v 1>For talking today. Thanks Lex.</v>
