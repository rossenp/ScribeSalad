1
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.430
<v 0>Yeah. You said Elon looking up,</v>

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.630
there's something about childlike wander to him, like to, to his personality,

3
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.070
his character, something about, I think more so than others,

4
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.830
what people can trust him. And there's, uh, I don't know, son,

5
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.860
&lt;inaudible&gt; an example of somebody it's like, there's some kind it's,

6
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.140
it's hard to put into words,

7
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.700
but there's something about the human being where he's trustworthy. Yeah.

8
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.860
He's, he's human in a way that, uh, connects to us. And the same with, uh,

9
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.540
SA Nadella. I mean, some of these folks, um,

10
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.610
something about us is drawn to them, even when they're flawed, even like,

11
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:45.470
um,

12
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.810
so like your thesis really holds up for Steve jobs because I think people didn't

13
00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:52.930
like Steve jobs, but like he delivered products that,

14
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.770
and then they fell in love every time. &lt;laugh&gt;, uh, I,

15
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.250
I guess you could say that the CEO,

16
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.410
the leader is also a product and if they keep delivering a product that people

17
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.920
like by being in public and saying things that people like,

18
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.680
that's also a way to make people happy. But from a social network perspective,

19
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.600
it makes me wonder how difficult it is to explain to people why

20
00:01:16.601 --> 00:01:19.200
certain things happen, like to explain machine learning,

21
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.870
to explain why certain, uh, the, uh,

22
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.870
the woke mob effect happens,

23
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.350
or the certain kinds of like bullying happens,

24
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.030
which is like it's human nature combined with algorithm.

25
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.470
And it's very difficult to control for how the spread of misinformation happens.

26
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.630
It's very difficult to control for that. And to,

27
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.700
so you try to elevate certain parts and you create more problems than you solve.

28
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.620
And anything that looks at all,

29
00:01:50.621 --> 00:01:54.060
like censorship can create huge amounts of problems as a celebrity slope.

30
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.700
And then you have to inject humans to oversee the machine learning algorithms.

31
00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:00.780
And anytime you inject humans into the system,

32
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.340
it's gonna create a huge number of problems.

33
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.500
And I feel like it's up to the leader to communicate that effect the,

34
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.690
to be transparent, uh, first of all,

35
00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:11.450
design products that don't have those problems. And second of all,

36
00:02:11.451 --> 00:02:14.290
when they have those problems to be able to communicate with them,

37
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.770
I guess that's all going to, when you run a social network company, &lt;laugh&gt;,

38
00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:19.690
your job is hard.

39
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.473
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

40
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.370
I will say the one element that you haven't named that I think you're getting at

41
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.480
is just be manner, which Steve jobs,

42
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.010
I never worked for him. I never met him in person. Um, had an enor,

43
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.450
like an uncanny ability in public to have bedside manner. I mean,

44
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:42.450
some of the best clips of Steve jobs are from like,

45
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.480
I wanna say maybe the eighties when he is on these stage and get questions

46
00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:51.920
from the audience about life, or, and he'll take this question that is like,

47
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.840
how are you gonna compete with blah? And it's super boring.

48
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.200
And I don't even name, know the name of the company. And his answer is,

49
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.920
is if you just asked, like your grandfather, the meaning of life. Yeah, yeah.

50
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.640
And you sit there and you're just like, what? Like, yeah.

51
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.560
And there's that bedside manner. Um,

52
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.320
and if you lack that or if that's just not intuitive to you, uh,

53
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.600
I think that it can be a lot harder to gain the trust of people and then add

54
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.030
on top of that missteps of companies. Right.

55
00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.030
It's I don't know if you have any friends from the past where like,

56
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.430
maybe they crossed you once or like maybe you get back together and your friends

57
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.110
again, but you just never really forget that thing. It's human nature.

58
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.910
Not to forget I'm rushing, you crossed me once &lt;laugh&gt; we solve the problem.

59
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:39.780
So my point is

60
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.280
it there's humans don't forget.

61
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.400
And if there are times in the past where they feel like they don't trust the

62
00:03:47.401 --> 00:03:52.360
company or the company hasn't had their back, that has really hard to earn back,

63
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.840
especially if you don't have that bedside manner. Um, and again,

64
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.280
like I'm not attributing this specifically to mark,

65
00:03:58.281 --> 00:04:02.150
because I think a lot of companies have this issue where

66
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.310
one, you have to be trustworthy of a company and,

67
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.750
and live by it and live by those actions. And then two,

68
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.030
I think you need to be able to be really relatable in a way that's very

69
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:17.830
difficult if you're worth like what these people are. It's really hard. Yeah.
