00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.200
<v 0>There are so many small companies who've been devastated this year.</v>

2
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.790
We have not seen a sustained attack on mom and pop shops. Uh,

3
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.080
like we've seen in 2020,

4
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.950
who are innovators and making something happen.

5
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.330
And when you're just like one dude, who's producing a product,

6
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.870
they're a sponsor of mine. I'm happy to. First of all,

7
00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:26.910
it's funny that I'm pitching underwear, but ha pitching.

8
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.510
But it's also something I enjoy small business.

9
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.130
It's microscopic like a thimble. So this isn't a sponsor of mine,

10
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.740
but this is a good segue. So this is Russians.

11
00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:40.890
We celebrate new year's none of them go at them. We have the Edmodo was,

12
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.170
he comes down, puts a president under your pillow.

13
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.940
So this is a company called JL Lawson. He's a fan of yours. He's a metal worker.

14
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.910
And he said, can I give you something to give to Lex?

15
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.050
I have one of his worry coins. I'll tell you what it is. He's not a sponsor.

16
00:00:55.051 --> 00:00:56.520
This is not, I'm not getting paid for this.

17
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.970
So what a worry coin is I carry around in my, but if you have rod denim,

18
00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:01.350
it's great because it brings you fades.

19
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.320
So you carry it around with you all the time. It says,

20
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:08.370
worrying is like paying a debt. You don't owe. Right?

21
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.330
And I carry this around and it's been like a year.

22
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.370
Next time you're worrying. And this is good advice.

23
00:01:14.371 --> 00:01:15.300
If you don't have a word coin,

24
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.220
go think about 10 years ago and what you were worried about then,

25
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.240
and then think about did any of those things pan out? And some of them did,

26
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.920
but you were able to handle it. And that's a good way to maintain perspective.

27
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:31.920
So JL Lawson's the company. He sent me this president. I said,

28
00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:36.840
let me give it to Lex on the air. So enjoy, sorry. I also open it up.

29
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.600
Yeah. J L Lawson and co two Lex from Anthony. Yeah.

30
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.850
And I said, make something mathematical for Lex.

31
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.800
I don't even know what's in there. You don't know what's in there.

32
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.090
And it got through TSA. It could be a bomb. It could be.

33
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.680
<v 1>Just like this episode.</v>

34
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.560
<v 0>Sure. You and rabbit close to the mic as a dress for crazy.</v>

35
00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.903
That's really the best thing.

36
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.540
Or is this what unboxing video looks like?

37
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.090
This conversation's going to be a big hit on the internet.

38
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.050
<v 1>Boxing community.</v>

39
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.870
<v 0>I need to have an excited look on my face to make sure the reaction video is</v>

40
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.850
being unboxing and a reaction video.

41
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.090
<v 1>Lex Freeman reacts. It's another box. It's just a series of boxes.</v>

42
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.110
<v 0>Lex, big fan. Since hearing you on Rogan months ago,</v>

43
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.010
most of your guests are over my head, but still enjoyable.

44
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.140
Like this episode,

45
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.310
Michael was kind enough to want to share my work with you.

46
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.500
Keep doing what you do, Anthony Lawson. Thanks, Anthony.

47
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.210
There's a lot in there. What is it?

48
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.740
<v 1>Okay. All right. Am I done by the way?</v>

49
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.160
<v 0>Sure. Show it to the camera and then make sure you look excited or not. No,</v>

50
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.860
this is cool. This is a worry coin. Like I was showing you. Oh,

51
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.560
so you hold it in your hand and when you can do this with your thumb,

52
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.810
if people are, have anxiety or whatever, or there's a lot of cool stuff in here,

53
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.470
Fibonacci coin. Oh see. Yeah. That's the math stuff. That's really awesome.

54
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.980
This is really cool. Wait, you got a big one landing there too.

55
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.733
That's what she said.

56
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.410
<v 1>I'm telling.</v>

57
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.320
<v 0>You last time you offended me saying I don't have humor.</v>

58
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.180
Uh, the spin tray, micro brass and copper bronze.

59
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.650
By the way, the packaging is Epic. I think that's his top.

60
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.790
He makes tops.

61
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:41.813
<v 1>Cool.</v>

62
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.820
<v 0>Spin it in there. And Institute two different, uh, bronze and copper.</v>

63
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.930
<v 1>I think.</v>

64
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.440
<v 0>The only one who makes these machine tops and then three sitting here, I guess.</v>

65
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.100
Yeah, but you could spin them in that step. That section. Okay. Got it. Cool.
