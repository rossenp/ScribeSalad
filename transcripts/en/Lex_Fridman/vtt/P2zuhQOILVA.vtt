00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.370
<v 0>Let me ask you a ridiculous question.</v>

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.690
Who's the greatest of all time freestyle or.

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.490
<v 1>Folkstyle oh, wrestling wrestling. Hmm. Well, I,</v>

4
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.650
I will say my knowledge passed like the year 2000 is really

5
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.210
not that great. Cause you can, in which.

6
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.330
<v 0>Direction, sorry. After.</v>

7
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.090
<v 1>2000, no, no. Before. Cause you can't find any film or anything, you know?</v>

8
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.120
And so you, you hear of all the, so you need.

9
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.120
<v 0>Evidence, you need.</v>

10
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.840
<v 1>Direct evidence.</v>

11
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.520
I wanna be able to watch 'em and see 'em and feel the times and feel their

12
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.240
opponents and you know, all those things to really like,

13
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.360
I hate giving bad answers, you know? So, um, I would, I,

14
00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:37.600
there's just not enough footage of any of those people, you know, we took,

15
00:00:37.601 --> 00:00:40.160
we go back to someone like Alexander Medved mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like,

16
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.600
you can't find footage, you can't find anything on him, you know?

17
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.630
So like who was he wrestling? I, you know, I'm not sure. So, um,

18
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.510
post 2000 I think. And, and obviously just freestyle. So.

19
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.870
<v 0>Um, Americans, Russian.</v>

20
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.670
<v 1>UHF has the, probably the best argument post 2000, I think said I of, um, if he.</v>

21
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.390
<v 0>Yeah, the Russian tank guy. Yeah. So who's, who's better Snyder or said.</v>

22
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.420
<v 1>I, I just wanted the Olympics. I.</v>

23
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.700
<v 0>Understand this. I understand how that works, but there's pretty close, right?</v>

24
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.180
Not really, not, not that match, but in general, the match up.

25
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.740
<v 1>So well, so Kyle won the first one in 17,</v>

26
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.860
said I have pinned him the following year,

27
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.140
but then Kyle lost and took bronze in 19. Um, and then just lost.

28
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.970
I don't want, I don't wanna say fairly decisively, but it was,

29
00:01:24.971 --> 00:01:27.530
it was six to three and it was a late take down.

30
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.530
You kind of gave it up and maybe it was really competitive. Maybe wouldn't have,

31
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.770
um, took her wrestle again in like two weeks here so that,

32
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.490
you know yeah. You, I mean, you have to say said live at this point.

33
00:01:39.491 --> 00:01:42.370
There's nothing else to say unless Kyle proves says otherwise.

34
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.440
<v 0>Yeah, not enough. People talk about so live. Okay.</v>

35
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.480
Well you think that guy should go to MMA.

36
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.560
You think Kyle should go to MMA some of these guys? Yeah.

37
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.320
<v 1>They're making enough money wrestling where they don't really feel the need to</v>

38
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.520
it's it's.

39
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.920
<v 0>Terrifying though.</v>

40
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.680
It's a heavyweight said alive would probably it's like it's like could be,

41
00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:02.040
but heavyweight. Well, I don't know.

42
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.760
<v 1>If you remember, do you remember mock off?</v>

43
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.870
So mock off actually was the Russian representative in both styles of 2016,

44
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.190
correctly and freestyle. Um, and he was to my knowledge,

45
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.350
the only person the UFC's ever signed that was zero and modern era signed.

46
00:02:17.351 --> 00:02:18.184
That was zero and zero.

47
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.310
And then he actually never ended up fighting &lt;laugh&gt; but weird. Right? So.

48
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.343
<v 0>Yeah, no motivation.</v>

49
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.990
<v 1>I, I don't know. I don't know what the story is. Cause sometimes I I'd rush.</v>

50
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.060
I mean, maybe you have better sources than I do.

51
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.020
Sometimes it feels like dudes just disappear.

52
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.980
Like they're a world champ or Olympic champ.

53
00:02:31.981 --> 00:02:34.700
And then all of a sudden you're like, wait, I, where do.

54
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.140
<v 0>You go? You, you talked about Russia earlier in the conversation. So, oh,</v>

55
00:02:38.141 --> 00:02:41.300
what'd I say I, I forgot, but I think steroids,

56
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.340
I think somebody's gonna show up to your door. I'm.

57
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.660
<v 1>Worried.</v>

58
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.130
I honestly I've said enough bad things where I would be kind looking over my

59
00:02:48.131 --> 00:02:49.970
shoulder if I went to the or something &lt;laugh&gt;.

60
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.850
<v 0>Oh, I for one love the Russians. What.</v>

61
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.770
<v 1>About IOUs? How does that.</v>

62
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.450
<v 0>Make you feel? What about it? It's fake news. Oh really?</v>

63
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.480
<v 2>I'm just kidding. It's propaganda. Maybe it's I dunno. I dunno. It's anymore.</v>

64
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.873
Yeah.

65
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.240
<v 0>You know, it's troublesome, man. I hate cheating in all of his forms.</v>
