1
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:03.440
<v 0>So you.</v>

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.550
<v 1>He did write the book, dear reader on, uh, Kim Jong IL. Yeah. Dear reader.</v>

3
00:00:07.551 --> 00:00:12.200
The unauthorized autobiography of Kim Jong-il. Yeah.

4
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.290
So that's the previous leader of North Korea, correct?

5
00:00:15.291 --> 00:00:20.240
Current one is the UN jargon. No, no creativity on the naming.

6
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.010
<v 0>Well, no, this is intentional because it's a throwback to, um,</v>

7
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.963
the dad.

8
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.540
<v 1>So there's been only three leaders in North Korea.</v>

9
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.410
So we've talked about the history of Hitler and Stalin and like these,

10
00:00:33.411 --> 00:00:37.490
I think it's important to understand that the history of those kinds of humans

11
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.260
there's the history of North Korea is not well written about or understood,

12
00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:44.810
which is why your book is exceptionally powerful and important.

13
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.300
So maybe in a big, broad way,

14
00:00:50.301 --> 00:00:52.160
can you say, who was,

15
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.290
who is Kim Jong IL as a,

16
00:00:57.291 --> 00:00:59.030
as a man, as a leader,

17
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.110
as a historical figure that we should understand and why should we understand

18
00:01:03.111 --> 00:01:03.380
them?

19
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.280
<v 0>So I wrote dear reader by going to North Korea and getting all their</v>

20
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.160
propaganda, which is translated to several languages.

21
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.710
Cause they're going to see it as everyone on earth is interested in them and

22
00:01:12.711 --> 00:01:15.320
wants to narrow their ideology.

23
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.040
<v 1>And he died in 2011, 2011. And you wrote the book in 2012.</v>

24
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.490
<v 0>Uh, I w I went there in 2012. I wrote the book came out in 2014.</v>

25
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.810
So Kim Jong-il is, um, donut and intellect,

26
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.200
North Korea version of Forrest Gump in that when they write their history,

27
00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:33.080
whenever something appeared happens, he's there. Uh,

28
00:01:33.081 --> 00:01:38.030
and by telling his life stories in the first person he's telling the history of

29
00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:42.350
North Korea. So I wanted to write the kind of book where in one book,

30
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.080
and it's the kind of reading you can do in the beach or the bathroom.

31
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.510
You're going to get the entire history and know everything you need to know

32
00:01:47.511 --> 00:01:51.620
about North Korea and one accessible outlet. And it's,

33
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.880
it's what people don't appreciate about North Korea. The several things,

34
00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:59.150
how bad it is, and this didn't happen overnight.

35
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.320
This was very systemic that what this family did to that country,

36
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.420
where piece by piece, they did everything in their power to hermetically,

37
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:12.500
seal it from the rest of the world, ramp up the oppression, uh,

38
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.500
keep any information from coming in. And, you know,

39
00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:20.330
they're very creative and innovative in their

40
00:02:20.331 --> 00:02:24.290
style of, uh, manipulation and control. Um,

41
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.490
so there is a farcical element. Let me give you an example.

42
00:02:28.491 --> 00:02:31.010
So people in the West kind of get it wrong. They're talking about, Oh,

43
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.010
they talk about when Kim Jong-il played golf for the first time,

44
00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:35.180
he gets 17 holes in one,

45
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.860
there's this one story about Kim Jong-il shrinking time.

46
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.540
And this is a story and it sounds supernatural, but it's not.

47
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.460
So Kim Jong-il is that a conference,

48
00:02:46.461 --> 00:02:49.130
the dear leader and someone is giving a talk.

49
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.320
And while that person is giving a talk,

50
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.860
Kim Jong-il is taking notes and working on what was work.

51
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.370
And he has an aide who keeps interrupting him with questions and the speaker

52
00:02:58.371 --> 00:03:02.410
keeps stopping. And Kim Jong-il says, why are you stopping? He goes,

53
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:05.530
I see you're doing some other things. And it goes, no, no, he can,

54
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.650
I can do all these things at once. Everyone was shocked. And they said,

55
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:12.700
this is why Kim Jong-il looks at time, not like a plane,

56
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.050
but like a cube. And he can shrink time. And my friend goes,

57
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.270
do they mean multitasking? And yes,

58
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.920
Kim Jong-il is the only person in North Korea. Who's capable of multitasking.

59
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.560
So in order to elevate him,

60
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.620
they basically make everyone else in North Korea,

61
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.250
completely incompetent. Um,

62
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.900
and that has a purpose because should the leader go away?

63
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.410
This country is going to collapse overnight. So this,

64
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.940
they laugh in the West about all these newspapers, show him, you know,

65
00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:48.790
at the factory. And he's at the fish hatchery at the paper plant.

66
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.800
They say the difference in North Korea is that the leader goes among the people

67
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.880
and does what he called field guidance. So he will go in that farm and be like,

68
00:03:57.881 --> 00:04:00.430
this is what you need to do. And he'll go here. And he's so smart.

69
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.060
He's good at everything. And thanks to him for sharing his wisdom with us.

70
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.540
And he's not removed from the people like in every other country.

71
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.890
<v 1>Why does that seem to go wrong with humans?</v>

72
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.270
Do you think that this kind of the structure where there's this one,

73
00:04:15.271 --> 00:04:17.970
figure the authoritarian, this,

74
00:04:17.971 --> 00:04:22.620
the totalitarian structure where there's one figure,

75
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.850
that's a source of comfort.

76
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.000
<v 0>Kim Jong IL is not good at farming.</v>

77
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.000
Kim Jong-il is not good at the machinery.

78
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.660
It's all a complete lie or the things he'll point out will be things that are

79
00:04:33.661 --> 00:04:37.950
completely obvious. So here's another example they use, uh, in North Korea,

80
00:04:37.951 --> 00:04:40.980
they have something called the tower that you should idea, which is an obelisk,

81
00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:42.420
which looks like the Washington monument,

82
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.990
but it's completely different because it's got this like plastic torch at the

83
00:04:45.991 --> 00:04:49.740
top. And they talk about in the propaganda,

84
00:04:49.741 --> 00:04:54.240
how all the architects got together. And they said,

85
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.960
Oh,

86
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.700
we should make this the second tallest stone obelisk in the world.

87
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.200
And Kim Jong-il says, no, let's make it the tallest. They're like, Oh,

88
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.370
we never thought of this before. And the way it's presented as it. And like,

89
00:05:08.371 --> 00:05:09.870
he's the first person to think of this.

90
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.750
Like these architects that having a brainstorming session.

91
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.790
That's how did you idea? They're like, all right,

92
00:05:14.791 --> 00:05:18.750
we gotta do something innovative to put North Korea on the map. What can we do?

93
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.400
How about second biggest piece going to go for this? And then he's like, Oh,

94
00:05:23.401 --> 00:05:26.100
we never thought of this. It's it's it's. So,

95
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.020
because I presented at face value, people sometimes say the book's a satire.

96
00:05:31.021 --> 00:05:34.530
It's not a satire. I downplayed all this stuff. It's a far Susan.

97
00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:36.840
Another example, North Korea is very big.

98
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.360
And I think Russia is to some extent too, on amusement parks.

99
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.320
Funfairs they call them the British style because this is the chance for the

100
00:05:43.321 --> 00:05:47.100
people told to get together. And there was this amusement park.

101
00:05:47.101 --> 00:05:48.270
It's almost like South park,

102
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.190
the Cartman where there's all these rides and Kim Jong-il is

103
00:05:53.191 --> 00:05:53.580
like,

104
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.490
I'm not gonna let any elderly or take these rides

105
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.080
until I put myself in danger and ride them

106
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:07.820
myself. And they go, but dear leader, it's drizzling. And he goes, Nope,

107
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.410
I have to make sure these rides are going to be safe for everyone.

108
00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:15.800
Even during the light rain to go well, can we go on these rides with you? No,

109
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:18.350
no, no. The courageous one.

110
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.920
And he's riding all the rides and they're standing there crying at his courage,

111
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.850
but that's what's and you asked all the things and when power it's like, listen,

112
00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:30.710
I'm quite confident that those FunFair engineers are in a position to

113
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:34.340
ride modest mouse reference called by themselves and be like, yeah, okay.

114
00:06:34.341 --> 00:06:37.130
This is good for the kids. Uh, although to be fair,

115
00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:41.810
some of those amusement parks are pretty rusty and dangerous, but that, that,

116
00:06:41.811 --> 00:06:42.160
that kind of.

117
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.110
<v 1>Propaganda, I guess what, I'm not playing a devil's advocate. It's like,</v>

118
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.000
it's, it's comforting and it's useful,

119
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:54.460
but it does seem that that naturally leads to an

120
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.373
abuse of power.

121
00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.540
<v 0>How can it be used correctly?</v>

122
00:06:58.541 --> 00:07:03.160
No one person has the intellect or the mind to understand the

123
00:07:03.161 --> 00:07:07.150
entirety of an economy, let alone every individual field of interest.

124
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:08.411
<v 1>Well, for example,</v>

125
00:07:08.411 --> 00:07:11.350
you can have an artificial intelligence system that understands the,

126
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:12.670
the entirety of it.

127
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.880
<v 0>I think just complete shame, the mask slip.</v>

128
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:17.950
So you could have an artificial intelligence system.

129
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.950
<v 1>Uh, but like the question is can that</v>

130
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.700
mean like the, the, the human version of that is like,

131
00:07:27.701 --> 00:07:31.330
you can hire a lot of experts, right? You can be an extremely good manager.

132
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.090
<v 0>Yeah. Since everything's dynamic, it's not going to,</v>

133
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.600
they're not going to have the data to kind of manage it. Well.

134
00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:42.220
<v 1>It seems that there's a, like what George Washington allegedly did.</v>

135
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.100
It seems like most humans are not able to fire themselves.

136
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.730
You're you're not able to like, yeah, you're right.

137
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:52.030
I'll tell you to be a check in your own power, but that's not. If I was like,

138
00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.050
uh, if I was creating a human is like,

139
00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:01.330
that's not an obvious bug of the system that we would

140
00:08:01.331 --> 00:08:05.290
not be able to fire ourselves due to, uh,

141
00:08:05.291 --> 00:08:09.310
to know when we have, I mean, it seems like that's something you have to know,

142
00:08:09.311 --> 00:08:13.390
always like that's something I often wonder is like, am I wrong about this?

143
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.190
<v 0>Well, this is what we talked about earlier.</v>

144
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.490
What are the safety valves to make sure that okay,

145
00:08:18.491 --> 00:08:23.110
if I am incorrect or my knowledge is finite Plato's cave kind of thing.

146
00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:27.670
What mechanisms are in place that my mistake we're limited information.

147
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.090
Isn't going to have deleterious consequences. I,

148
00:08:31.091 --> 00:08:32.890
North Korea does not really have that. And as a result,

149
00:08:32.891 --> 00:08:34.390
they had polio in the nineties.
