00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.550
<v 0>Speaking of wild ideas.</v>

2
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.190
Let me ask you about the thing we mentioned previously,

3
00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:11.790
which is this interstellar object, a more, more Uhhuh,

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.030
could it be space junk from a distant alien civilization?

5
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.950
<v 1>You can't immediately discount that by saying absolutely.</v>

6
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.020
It cannot. Anything can be space junk. I mean, from that point of view,

7
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.340
can any of the ER belt objects we see could be space, space, junk,

8
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.260
anything on the night sky can in principle be space junk.

9
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.500
<v 0>And Kiper belt would catch Intella objects potentially in like force them into</v>

10
00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:41.340
Norbit if they're like small enough, uh.

11
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.180
<v 1>Not the ER belt itself,</v>

12
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.330
but you can imagine like Jupyter family comments being captured. Uh, you know,

13
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.650
so, so you can actually capture things.

14
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.810
It's even easier to do this very early in the solar system,

15
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.450
like early in the solar system's life while it's still in a cluster of stars.

16
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.530
Um, it's unavoidable that you capture debris,

17
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.760
whether it be natural debris or unnatural debris,

18
00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:09.920
or just debris of some kind from other stars that

19
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.040
it's like a daycare center, right.

20
00:01:12.041 --> 00:01:16.960
Like everybody passes their infections onto other kids. Yeah. Um, you know,

21
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.040
or more, more, there's been a lot of discussion about,

22
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.440
there's been a lot of interest in this over like, is it, is it aliens or is it,

23
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.910
but let's like, if you just kind of look at the facts,

24
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.270
like what we know about it is it's kind of like a weird shape and it also

25
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.630
accelerated, you know, right. Like that's the two, those are,

26
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.070
those are the two interesting, uh, things about it. There are,

27
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.280
um,

28
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.260
there are puzzles about it and perhaps the most, uh,

29
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.140
daring resolution to this puzzle is that it's not, you know,

30
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.500
aliens or it's not like a rock, it's actually a piece of hydrogen ice.

31
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.420
So this is a friend of mine, uh, you know,

32
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.770
Dar Seligman and Greg Laughlin came up with this, uh, idea, uh,

33
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.130
where that in giant molecular clouds that are just clouds of

34
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.170
hydrogen, helium gas that live in, um,

35
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.010
live throughout the galaxy at their cores.

36
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.690
You can condense ice to become these hydrogen, you know,

37
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.770
icebergs, if you will. And then, uh,

38
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.640
that explains many of the aspects of, uh, in fact,

39
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.240
I think that explains all of the mystery,

40
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.040
how it becomes elongated mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; because basically the hydrogen eye

41
00:02:37.041 --> 00:02:40.960
sublimate and kind of like a bar of soap that, you know,

42
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.920
slowly kind of elongates as you, uh, as you strip away the,

43
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.590
of the surface layers, uh,

44
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.030
how it was able to accelerate because of a jet that is produced from, you know,

45
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.270
the hydrogen coming off of it, but you can't see it cuz it's hydrogen gas,

46
00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.040
like all of this stuff, uh, kind of falls together nicely. Mm-hmm,

47
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.120
&lt;affirmative&gt;, I'm, I'm intrigued by that idea truly because it's like,

48
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.440
if that's true, that's a new type of astrophysical object.

49
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.680
<v 0>And it would be produced by, uh, what's the monster that produced it initially,</v>

50
00:03:15.681 --> 00:03:17.040
that kind of object. Uh.

51
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.470
<v 1>So this is giant molecular M clouds they're everywhere. I mean,</v>

52
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.670
they are the fact that they exist is not, are they.

53
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.310
<v 0>Rogue clouds or are they part of like an or cloud?</v>

54
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.710
<v 1>No clouds. Yeah. They're just floating about, yeah.</v>

55
00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:35.470
So if you go like a lot of people, imagine the galaxy as being a,

56
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.500
you know, a bunch of stars, right. And they're just a orbiting. Right.

57
00:03:40.501 --> 00:03:44.820
But the truth is if you fly between stars, you, you run into clouds, uh.

58
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.940
<v 0>That don't have any large object that creates orbits.</v>

59
00:03:47.941 --> 00:03:49.660
They're just floating about they're just floating,

60
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.020
but why are they floating together?

61
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.500
Or they just float together for time and not.

62
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.900
<v 1>Well, so these are the, these eventually become the nurseries of stars.</v>

63
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.170
So as they, as they cool, they contract and uh, you know,

64
00:04:03.171 --> 00:04:07.610
then collapse into stars or into groups of stars. But some of them, the,

65
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.170
the starless, um, molecular clouds,

66
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.010
according to the calculations that Dar and Greg did, can,

67
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.280
uh, can create these like icy of hydrogen ice. I wonder.

68
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.720
<v 0>Why they would be flying so fast.</v>

69
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.080
Cause it seemed to be moving pretty fast at a more, a.

70
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.400
<v 1>More, yeah. Oh, uh, that's just because of their acceleration due to, uh,</v>

71
00:04:30.401 --> 00:04:33.040
due to the sun, if you stop, I mean, it's like

72
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.520
take something really far away, let it go.

73
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.400
And the sun is here by the time it comes close to the sun rights.

74
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.630
Good moving pretty fast. So that's an attractive explanation, I think,

75
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.950
not so much because, uh, it's cool, but it makes a clear prediction.

76
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.810
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; right.

77
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.790
Of when ver Ruben observatory comes online next year or

78
00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.310
so we will discover many, many more of these objects. Right.

79
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.300
And they have, um, so I like,

80
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.860
I like theories that are falsifiable, right? Not just, not just testable,

81
00:05:07.861 --> 00:05:11.700
but falsifiable it's, it's good to have a falsifiable theory where you can say,

82
00:05:11.701 --> 00:05:15.180
that's not true. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; uh, aliens is a,

83
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.780
is one that's fundamentally difficult to say, no, that's not aliens. Right.

84
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.100
<v 0>Well, the interesting thing to me,</v>

85
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.410
if you look at one alien civilization mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

86
00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.970
and then we look at the things that produces in terms of,

87
00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:30.850
if we were to try to detect the alien civilization,

88
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.890
the there's like, uh, say there's 10 billion aliens.

89
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.930
That would probably be, Hmm.

90
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.400
Trillions of dumb drone type things produced by the

91
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.600
aliens. And there'd be many, many,

92
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.640
many more orders and magnitude of junk mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. So like,

93
00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:57.040
if you were to look for an alien civilization in my mind,

94
00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.200
you would be looking for the junk that's the more efficient thing to look for

95
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.320
that. So I'm not saying a more, more has any characteristics of space junk,

96
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.960
but it kind of opened my eyes,

97
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.760
like to the idea that we shouldn't necessarily be looking to

98
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.030
the queen of the, an colony. We should be looking at a, I don't know,

99
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.383
I don't know, like,

100
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.510
like traces of alien life that doesn't look intelligent in any way may

101
00:06:23.511 --> 00:06:25.790
not even look like life. It could be just garbage.

102
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.950
We should be looking for garbage.

103
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.270
<v 1>Just generically, just generic, well.</v>

104
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.350
<v 0>Garbage that's produceable by, uh, unnatural, uh,</v>

105
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.500
forces that, I mean, for me,

106
00:06:37.501 --> 00:06:40.900
at least that was kind of interesting because if you have a successful alien

107
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:45.780
civilization that we will be producing many more orders and magnitude of junk,

108
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.700
and that would be easier potentially to detect well.

109
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.740
<v 1>So you have to produce the junk, but you have to also launch launch it.</v>

110
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.220
So this is the, this is where, I mean, let's, let's imagine disposal. Yeah.

111
00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.330
&lt;laugh&gt; but let's imagine we are a successful civilization that,

112
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.770
you know, has made it to space. We clearly have. Right. Um, and yes,

113
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.770
we're in the infancy of that pursuit, but you know, we've launched,

114
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.170
I don't know how many satellites, um,

115
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.970
probably if you count GPS satellites, it must be at least that.

116
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.240
<v 0>It's, it's certainly thousands. I don't know if it's over 10,000. Yeah.</v>

117
00:07:21.241 --> 00:07:22.120
But it's on that order.

118
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.240
<v 1>But it's on that, like a large order of magnitude.</v>

119
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:29.280
How many of the things that we've launched will ever leave the solar system?

120
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.720
I think two, two so far. Well maybe the Voyager,

121
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.600
the Voyager one Voyager two. I don't know if the pioneer, so maybe three, like,

122
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:38.870
oh, there's also.

123
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.150
<v 0>A Tesla roast out there.</v>

124
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.270
<v 1>Uh, that, that one, it will never leave the solar system. It'll just,</v>

125
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.070
I think that one will eventually collide with Mars.

126
00:07:47.071 --> 00:07:51.470
That can be SpaceX's first Mars, destination. Um,

127
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:56.510
but look, so there is an energetic cost to Intertel or travel,

128
00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:01.660
uh, which is really hard to overcome. And when, when we think about, you know,

129
00:08:01.661 --> 00:08:04.740
generically, what do we look for in an alien civilization?

130
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:09.620
Oftentimes we tend to imagine that the thing you look for is a thing that we're

131
00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:14.420
doing right now. Yeah. Right. So I think that, um, you know, if I,

132
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.260
if I look at the future, right. I mean for a while, like, okay, if aliens are,

133
00:08:19.261 --> 00:08:23.890
are out there, they must be broadcasting and radio. Right, right. That radio,

134
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:25.690
um, you know,

135
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:30.570
the amount that we broadcast in radio has diminished tremendously.

136
00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:31.970
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; in the last 50 years,

137
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:36.410
but we're doing a lot more computation. Right.

138
00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:39.610
What are the signs of computation? Like, that's a good,

139
00:08:39.611 --> 00:08:44.240
that's an interesting question to ask. Right. Um, where, I don't know.

140
00:08:44.241 --> 00:08:49.080
I think something on the order of a few percent of the entire electrical grid

141
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:53.080
last year went to mining Bitcoin mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; right. Uh.

142
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.720
<v 0>You know, well there and the, yeah, the, the,</v>

143
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.440
there could be a lot of in the future,

144
00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:01.760
different consequences of the computation, which I mean, by I'm biased,

145
00:09:01.761 --> 00:09:04.440
but it could be robotics. It could be artificial intelligence.

146
00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:09.160
So we may be looking for intelligent

147
00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.160
looking objects. Like that's what I meant by probes.

148
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.400
Like things that move in kind of artificial way.

149
00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:18.310
<v 1>But the emergence of AI is not on if right.</v>

150
00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.670
It's it's happening at right in front of our eyes

151
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.910
and the energetic costs associated with that are becoming, you know,

152
00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:28.910
a tangible problem.

153
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:33.590
So I think if you imagine kind of extrapolating that into the future,

154
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:39.900
what are the, you know, what becomes the bottleneck, right.

155
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.140
The bottleneck might be powering, you know,

156
00:09:44.141 --> 00:09:47.380
powering the AI broadly speaking, not one AI,

157
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:52.260
but powering that entire AI ecosystem. Right. So I don't know.

158
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:57.250
I think, you know, space junk isn't is of, um,

159
00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.810
it's an interesting idea, but it's,

160
00:09:58.811 --> 00:10:03.530
it's heavily influenced by like sci-fi 1950s where by 2020,

161
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.650
we're all like flying to the moon. Um,

162
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.410
and so we produce a lot of space junk. I'm not

163
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.930
sure if that's the pathway that alien civilizations take,

164
00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.280
so never seen an alien civilization. That's.

165
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:23.360
<v 0>True. But if your, uh, theory of chill &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. Uh,</v>

166
00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:27.280
turns out to be true. And then we don't, you know, we don't necessarily explore,

167
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.120
we seize the exploration phase of a, a like alien civilizations,

168
00:10:31.121 --> 00:10:35.160
quickly seize the exploration phase of their, um,

169
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.190
of their efforts then, uh,

170
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:43.470
then perhaps they'll just be chilling in a particular space expanding slowly,

171
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:47.070
but then using up a lot of resources and then have to have a lot of garbage

172
00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:51.390
disposal that sends stuff out. Yeah. And the other, you know,

173
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:55.070
the other idea was that it could be a relay that, uh,

174
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:59.980
you'll almost have like the, these GPS, like markers that send throughout,

175
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:02.340
which I think is kind of interesting. It's, uh,

176
00:11:02.341 --> 00:11:06.540
similar to this probe idea of sending, um,

177
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.820
a large number of probes out to measure gravitational, um,

178
00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:17.500
to, to measure basically yeah. The, the gravitational field, essentially.

179
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:18.090
I mean,

180
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:22.730
a lot of people at Caltech or in MIT are trying to measure gravitational fields

181
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:27.410
and there's, there's a lot of ideas of sending, uh, um,

182
00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:32.730
stuff out there that accurately measures those gravitational fields, uh,

183
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:36.210
to have a greater understanding of the early universe.

184
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:41.120
But then you might realize that communication through gravitation through

185
00:11:41.121 --> 00:11:44.640
gravity is actually much more effective than, than radio was. For example,

186
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:49.160
something like that. And then you send out, I mean, okay. Yeah.

187
00:11:49.161 --> 00:11:50.360
If you're an alien civilization,

188
00:11:50.361 --> 00:11:55.320
that's able to have gigantic masses mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; like,

189
00:11:55.321 --> 00:11:56.680
basically we're.

190
00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.680
<v 1>Getting there as a, as a civilization.</v>

191
00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.320
<v 0>No, we're not, not even close.</v>

192
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:01.440
<v 1>Well, I mean.</v>

193
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.200
<v 0>Okay. You're okay. I, I mean, like be able to sort of, uh,</v>

194
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:08.120
play with black holes, that kind of thing.

195
00:12:08.121 --> 00:12:12.040
So we're talking about whole nother different order of magnitude of masses.

196
00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:16.430
Then it, it may be very effective to send signals via gravitational ways.

197
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:17.530
<v 1>I actually,</v>

198
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:22.230
my sense is that all of these things are genuinely difficult to

199
00:12:22.231 --> 00:12:26.110
predict, you know, and I don't mean like to, to kind of shy away. I just,

200
00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:29.510
I really mean if you think, if you take, um,

201
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.820
imagination of what the future looked like from, you know,

202
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.020
500 years ago. Yeah. Right. It's just,

203
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:42.220
it is so hard to conceive of the impossible. Right. So, um,

204
00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.020
it's, it's almost like, um, you know,

205
00:12:46.021 --> 00:12:50.100
it's almost limiting to try and imagine things that are an order of magnitude,

206
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.850
uh, you know, or two orders of magnitude ahead in terms of per progress,

207
00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:58.370
just because, you know, you mentioned cars before, you know yeah.

208
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:03.090
If you were to ask people what they wanted in 1870,

209
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:07.690
it's faster buggies &lt;laugh&gt; right. So, um, so I, I think the whole,

210
00:13:07.691 --> 00:13:09.290
like kind of, you know,

211
00:13:09.291 --> 00:13:13.130
alien conversation inevitably gets,

212
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.640
gets limited by, by our entire kind of collective, um,

213
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:20.320
astrophysical, lack of imagination.
