00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.670
<v 0>Let me ask sort of a critical question of if you're wrong,</v>

2
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.340
about your statements of about Bitcoin,

3
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.420
you find out years from now that you were wrong, what would that look like?

4
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.320
What would be the things that make you realize you are wrong,

5
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.070
likely ideas or crazy out there? Ideas.

6
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.890
Do you think about this kind of stuff all the.

7
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:28.723
<v 1>Time.</v>

8
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.790
<v 0>Because you speak very confidently about Bitcoin and one of the things and you</v>

9
00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:37.730
put it this way. I think certainty,

10
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.570
I feel like that's like a stoic statement, certainty,

11
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.830
least a ruin or something like that. I like certainty, I think,

12
00:00:45.831 --> 00:00:50.480
is in antithesis to progress often

13
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.350
and especially in your writing, but this is true for the Bitcoin community.

14
00:00:54.351 --> 00:00:59.240
There's a S there's a certainty about the Bitcoin.

15
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.900
And that makes me very skeptical, no matter how good the ideas are,

16
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.580
whenever things are good. This might be the Russian in me. I think like,

17
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.610
what are the ways this is going to go wrong? So,

18
00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:14.750
so what do you think are the ways this might go wrong or you're wrong in your

19
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.810
conception of what Bitcoin is? Yes.

20
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.910
<v 1>So science</v>

21
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.300
evolves via negativa,

22
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.190
meaning that we're not proving hypothesis.

23
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.220
And that's what becomes the body of science.

24
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.950
Science is whatever's left over as we disprove hypothesis, right?

25
00:01:36.951 --> 00:01:41.750
Whatever we can empirically through experimentation

26
00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:45.860
disprove gets discarded and whatever remains, um,

27
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.930
whatever theory remains it hasn't been disproven is science effectively.

28
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.500
Um, this process is similar to market actors,

29
00:01:57.501 --> 00:01:59.960
zeroing in on a store value, right there.

30
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.530
They're experimenting with different forms of, uh,

31
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.950
storing wealth across time. Uh, some do better than others.

32
00:02:06.951 --> 00:02:11.090
And eventually everyone ends up on the one that is best. That's what gold was.

33
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.230
Um, in terms of understanding Bitcoin,

34
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.410
I look at it as a similar approach. And then I'm actually,

35
00:02:18.411 --> 00:02:21.890
that is the main question I'm asking myself is how do you stop this thing?

36
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.910
How do you turn it off? How do you end it? If you're a nation state,

37
00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:28.820
particularly who has the most to lose in this transition,

38
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.170
what is the attack vector by which they neutralize Bitcoin? I mean,

39
00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:37.100
that is the $250 trillion question. And,

40
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.720
you know, I've spent five years thinking about this thing very deeply.

41
00:02:41.721 --> 00:02:46.340
I've read everything on monetary history. I can get my hands on. Um,

42
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.640
the general thought of how it has stopped. And this is,

43
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.720
this is the snag point that a lot of people get to in their explorations down

44
00:02:56.721 --> 00:02:59.000
the rabbit hole is they just say, the government will never allow it.

45
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.450
And that becomes kind of their bottom. It's like, all right,

46
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.520
Bitcoin's interesting. It's superior money, blah, blah, blah.

47
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.470
But the government will never allow it. And this.

48
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.330
<v 0>Was a Ray Daleo. Did he.</v>

49
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.340
<v 1>Say that Dahlia was currently stuck there? Yep.</v>

50
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.340
<v 0>So Ray Dalio said that, uh,</v>

51
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.320
Bitcoin seems to be too promising, uh, if,

52
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.070
if it is in fact as promising as it looks, uh,

53
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.120
governments are going to, uh, I don't forget what the exact quote is,

54
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.050
but not about ban it. Governments will ban it.

55
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.820
So how do you get Ray Daleo unstuck from your perspective?

56
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.080
Well,

57
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.890
and how do you get unstuck from that idea that governments will governments?

58
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.930
How do you prevent governments from stopping a thing that, uh,

59
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.550
threatened centralized power?

60
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.760
<v 1>Well, Bitcoin is an idea.</v>

61
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.090
So governments that are really good at

62
00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:59.500
fighting centralized threats to their power, right?

63
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:02.710
Whether that's occurrence account or fitter or competing nation, state,

64
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.240
or business, they don't like, or an individual, they don't like, you know,

65
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.340
they can kill them, they can throw them in jail,

66
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.820
they can use any number of course, of our violent tactics to suppress it.

67
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.010
But how do you point a gun at an idea? How do you,

68
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.910
how do you course an idea? Um,

69
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.570
and that's, you know, there's some,

70
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.760
there is some anecdotal history here where there's the PGP case,

71
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.460
which in the United States, uh,

72
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.650
the court was trying to classify it as munitions when we're shipping this pretty

73
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:41.170
good privacy software over, uh,

74
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.620
overseas government wanted to classify it as munitions and restrict that

75
00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:47.260
exportation. But,

76
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.310
and this was a circuit court case precedent when, uh,

77
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.110
the PGP attorneys actually printed out the source code on paper and presented it

78
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.430
as evidence in the court.

79
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.370
All of a sudden it became protected under freedom of speech.

80
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.990
And that it's just code his speech code is his language. And,

81
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.510
um, therefore at least in the United States,

82
00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:10.630
it's protected under the first amendment. Um,

83
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.960
I think a government ban would be largely unenforceable

84
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.560
frankly, on Bitcoin. Um, being that it's pure information,

85
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.870
if you suppress market actors from using it in one

86
00:05:25.871 --> 00:05:30.510
jurisdiction, you're just creating incentives for them to go elsewhere. Uh,

87
00:05:30.511 --> 00:05:33.700
and you're actually increasing the incidence for other jurisdictions to be,

88
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.970
be favorable towards it because then they can create,

89
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.480
they get to benefit from the tax revenue and the businesses and the innovation

90
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.180
that's occurring in and around Bitcoin as a result.

91
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.580
<v 0>So you don't think if a particular central bank like in Europe or</v>

92
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:52.870
United States bands that not maybe using those terms,

93
00:05:52.871 --> 00:05:55.630
but in some kind of way you think there's a,

94
00:05:55.631 --> 00:05:59.510
that provides a really strong incentive for the other big players too.

95
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.260
<v 1>Enable it that's right. And that,</v>

96
00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:06.920
they're more likely since governments know this, by the way, too.

97
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.810
The other thing that causes the government to shoot itself in the foot is that

98
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:15.860
if they ban something, they draw a lot of attention to it. People are smart.

99
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.370
I mean, people ask why, why would a government ban that? Why can't I use this?

100
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.990
So that's kind of typically be the last arrow in their quiver. Um,

101
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.690
they may try to ban it is Bitcoin, you know,

102
00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:29.150
really starts to monetize very quickly. And this,

103
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.500
the power structures that they impose today start to dissolve, uh,

104
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.650
faster than I, you know, others might think they will,

105
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.820
then they might try and ban it.

106
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.140
But I think that ban will be largely unenforceable. Um,

107
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.860
they're more likely to tax it, which they already do tax it. Um,

108
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.850
they're likely to increase taxation of it. Uh, they would,

109
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.500
they're likely to try and make it more white market actually tracing

110
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:59.270
Bitcoin, seeing who has it attaching identities to Bitcoin ownership,

111
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.170
um, and making sure that they're getting their pound of flush on all the

112
00:07:03.171 --> 00:07:05.210
transactions it results in.

113
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.040
But I don't think the other thing about this is

114
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.460
so we saw the internet out-compete intranets, um,

115
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.000
and that the, we can say that open source networks send out,

116
00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:23.900
compete closed source networks. And there's a really good reason for this as,

117
00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:26.480
because in a closed source network,

118
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:31.220
there are costs associated with defending the network itself.

119
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.560
So you have to the network owners,

120
00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:39.290
the owners of the closed source network have to expend resources,

121
00:07:39.291 --> 00:07:41.690
protecting it from competitors.

122
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.280
And they have to expend resources imposing its rules because people they're not

123
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:49.400
voluntarily adopted rules. So you actually have to impose these rule sets,

124
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.230
whereas an open source network,

125
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.830
which is something much more akin to capitalism pure in its pure sense.

126
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.380
These are voluntarily adopted rules.

127
00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.980
So all market participants have agreed and consented to this rule set.

128
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.430
So there's no enforcement costs and there's no turf protection because anyone

129
00:08:04.431 --> 00:08:09.350
can freely enter or exit the open network for that energetic reason.

130
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.270
I think open networks, out-compete close networks typically.

131
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.990
And in the digital age, that's why I think open source.

132
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.640
That's why internet out-compete internet.

133
00:08:19.641 --> 00:08:23.270
And that's why open source networks they're going to eat closed source networks.

134
00:08:23.271 --> 00:08:27.830
So what Bitcoin would be in that lens is the ultimate open source monetary

135
00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:32.090
network, devouring closed source central bank, monetary networks.

136
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:33.703
And I,

137
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:38.810
I just don't see how there's no possibility of

138
00:08:38.811 --> 00:08:41.570
unilaterally stopping Bitcoin or destroying it.

139
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:45.800
So then they're more likely to regulate or tax it.

140
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.440
Uh, and again,

141
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.320
the other fallacy here is that a lot of people tend to think of governments as

142
00:08:51.321 --> 00:08:54.260
these singular indivisible, uh,

143
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:59.100
entities like that is move under one plan. But in reality, it's a lot of people,

144
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.510
right? And a lot of people with loosely,

145
00:09:00.511 --> 00:09:04.020
coupled interests and agendas and whatnot, uh,

146
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.630
regulators and, and, um,

147
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.570
others where they're wearing their citizen hat.

148
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.730
They're going to see this thing monetizing.

149
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:15.150
They're going to be on the front lines of, um, trying to regulate it,

150
00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:16.020
trying to control it.

151
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.260
And I think what's likely to happen is they're going to start to adopt it,

152
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:22.590
to buy some of it, uh,

153
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:26.550
even as an individual or possibly even ultimately as it's at a central bank or

154
00:09:26.551 --> 00:09:30.360
sovereign wealth fund level as an insurance policy against the success.

155
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:36.480
And once you start to acquire something and then you have a vested economic

156
00:09:36.481 --> 00:09:38.430
interest in its monetization,

157
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:42.930
I think it kind of dissolves any of the power structures that are raid against

158
00:09:42.931 --> 00:09:47.100
it from the inside. So I've written a lot about this, uh,

159
00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.780
in a new series called sovereign ism,

160
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:52.350
which is based loosely on a book called the sovereign individual.

161
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:57.720
And that's the general thesis is that microprocessing technology would

162
00:09:57.721 --> 00:10:00.180
devour our organizational models. Uh,

163
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:02.130
the most important of which is the nation state.

164
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:07.680
So I think we're going into this world where coercion and violence is just

165
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:11.100
much less rewarding. Um, it, you can't,

166
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.780
the economics of violence are declining because of the,

167
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.900
the low cost of protecting property, right?

168
00:10:18.901 --> 00:10:22.980
You can now protect your monetary property, uh,

169
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.530
in Bitcoin at orders of magnitude,

170
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.620
less costs than is necessary to run a banking network.

171
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.520
So it changes the way, uh,

172
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.500
it changes the way we organize ourselves. And again,

173
00:10:34.501 --> 00:10:38.880
if we zooming back to gold as kind of the original governor to governments,

174
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.240
or if they manipulated the money, gold would leave their country.

175
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.210
That's why governments have, um,

176
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:50.040
taken relatively concerted action to go off of the gold standard. Uh,

177
00:10:50.041 --> 00:10:54.840
there's a great book on this called the gold wars, um, that, that outlines,

178
00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:59.070
how governments have been waging, a cold war against gold for the past 50 years,

179
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.040
Bitcoin sort of, uh,

180
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.970
renews hope for that free market governor of governments.

181
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:09.120
And that is this digital gold that governments cannot stop or co-opt.

182
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:14.520
So I think it's something that's why I think it's such a big deal is that

183
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.630
it is changing.

184
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.990
It's a new useful fiction. You might say a useful fiction.

185
00:11:21.991 --> 00:11:24.990
That's super ordinant to the mythology of the nation,

186
00:11:24.991 --> 00:11:28.920
state and government as the dominant institution in the world. Why.

187
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.300
<v 0>You're right. That, uh, all forms of centralized power</v>

188
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.190
started breaking apart naturally. So governments,

189
00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.390
the more and more power is given to the individual, whatever the technology is.

190
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:47.070
And Bitcoin seems to be a promising technology that empowers that enables that

191
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:51.360
that seems to be the trend. And that's a promising trend from a,

192
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:56.350
at least from a perspective of somebody who values this particular biological

193
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.330
meat bag. That's full of.

194
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.740
<v 1>I think Bitcoin is exposing the greatest scam in human history,</v>

195
00:12:02.741 --> 00:12:04.000
which has political authority,

196
00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:09.460
like who gives anyone the right to be politically have political authority over

197
00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:10.294
anyone else.

198
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:15.100
People should be free to adopt the rules and systems and tools that best suit

199
00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:18.760
their needs. And you know, that heart,

200
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:21.700
that arc of history we covered earlier, where as

201
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.760
socioeconomic systems have become more favorable towards individual sovereignty,

202
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.740
the more wealthy we have become,

203
00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:34.870
the more we have given the individual we've maximized individual choice, uh,

204
00:12:34.871 --> 00:12:38.800
the more wealth that society has created and the more it is out competed, uh,

205
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:41.530
the systems that have come before it, the latest would be, you know,

206
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.600
capitalism triumphing over socialism.
