00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.890
<v 0>From the perspective of the startup,</v>

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.700
I was always kind of skeptical of raising money.

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.540
It feels like people do it too quickly, too easily. Um,

4
00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:15.330
but I don't know what the hell I'm talking about it.

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.590
One is the one should a startup raise money.

6
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.960
And from the perspective of the investor,

7
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.470
when should the investor invest in a startup? Like,

8
00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:29.340
is there a timing thing here? Is there, um, what, yeah.

9
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.291
<v 1>It's, it's a, it's a,</v>

10
00:00:30.291 --> 00:00:35.180
it's a very important question because the venture capital community is

11
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.800
only going to fund, you know, sub 1% of enterprise to start it in the,

12
00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:43.280
in the United States every year. Like maybe 10 basis points of them,

13
00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:48.020
like one in a thousand. And the reason is it's jet fuel.

14
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.100
You only want to take that money if you really want to build something big and

15
00:00:52.101 --> 00:00:56.210
you want to build it fast. And when you put jet fuel behind a startup,

16
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.950
as we've seen with other rockets, things can blow up and people can die.

17
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.040
You know, it's not people literally dying, but the business can go up in smoke,

18
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.830
right? Like rockets get blown up all the time.

19
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.730
That's pays X as part of their ambitious plans and startups seven out of 10

20
00:01:10.731 --> 00:01:14.000
startups. We invest in go to zero. Now,

21
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.300
if you were to start the business and only build it off customer revenue and use

22
00:01:17.301 --> 00:01:20.270
your own money and go nice and slow and grow 10% a year,

23
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.400
the chances of you blowing up the rocket are very low because you're riding a

24
00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:29.900
bicycle. You can go a little faster, but the bicycle can only go so fast.

25
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.700
And once you start taking that money, the way the portfolio,

26
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.780
the way venture capital is constructed as a, um,

27
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.370
in the mix of like MIT or Harvard's endowments is, you know,

28
00:01:43.371 --> 00:01:46.280
we're gonna put some money into a safe things.

29
00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:48.620
And then we're going to have these really binary things over here.

30
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.510
And they probably put 5% in venture capital. Traditionally,

31
00:01:53.511 --> 00:01:58.430
it's grown to 20% just as a function of how successful it's been. So, you know,

32
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.540
the Harvard's of the world and MIT is probably one, five or 10% in venture,

33
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.210
but it's grown to 25% because you know,

34
00:02:05.211 --> 00:02:07.910
companies like Airbnb and Uber have grown so big and Tesla,

35
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.750
but the goal is in these venture funds,

36
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.100
we're going to invest in 30 names and one or two of them are going to return

37
00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:17.750
three times the capital we've deployed.

38
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.200
So it's a $300 million fund and there's 30 names. They each got 10 million.

39
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.910
That means one of the 10 million is going to return the fund plus.

40
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.190
So that means it has to grow 30 X and then 60 X to

41
00:02:31.191 --> 00:02:32.024
double the fund.

42
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.030
And you're really supposed to be doing three times cash on cash.

43
00:02:35.031 --> 00:02:36.350
So that $300 million funds,

44
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.180
the expectation is in 10 years to return 900 billion triple the person's money,

45
00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:44.030
as opposed to the stock market, which doubles your money in the same period.

46
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.560
So you're supposed to do 25% annualized returns in order to

47
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.933
triple the money.

48
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.150
And maybe I have an outlying chance of four or five times the money,

49
00:02:53.151 --> 00:02:56.240
which does happen sometimes when you have an outlier on your portfolio like Uber

50
00:02:56.241 --> 00:02:57.140
or Facebook was.

51
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.720
And what that means is the venture capitalist's behavior.

52
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.210
And the game they're playing is different than you. As the founder, you,

53
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:04.871
as the founder,

54
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:08.140
you may really care about this and it dying really matters to you.

55
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.170
And then you've got a venture capitalist. Who's like, we're betting on 30 names.

56
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:13.960
We need two of them to hit it out of the park,

57
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.270
maybe three and nothing else is meaningful.

58
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.090
So now you start thinking about the game theory there you're dealing with,

59
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.931
you know,

60
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:27.670
money that is coming in that only cares about you going a

61
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:31.660
hundred X. Yes, it's a whole different ball game.

62
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.270
Whereas if you build off revenue, you don't have to do that.

63
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:37.180
And if you look@acompanylikecalm.com, we invested at 5 million.

64
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:38.410
The next round they did was two 50.

65
00:03:38.411 --> 00:03:43.180
They were so capital efficient that they grew from $10,000 a month in revenue to

66
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:46.630
millions of dollars a month in revenue over those four years,

67
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.300
since we invested and they didn't raise money in between, well,

68
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.900
it was unbelievable. And I've only seen this happen three or four times.

69
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.080
<v 2>And all this capital efficient meaning, uh,</v>

70
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.650
based on customer revenue alone,

71
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.490
plus some small amount of fundraising you're able to go, like,

72
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.080
how hard is it to do that?

73
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.320
<v 1>It takes extreme product market fit.</v>

74
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.910
You have to have a great price for your product that has a great margin. Um,

75
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.450
yeah. And if you're doing something in hardware, it's probably impossible.

76
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.740
Cause it's super capital intensive.

77
00:04:16.741 --> 00:04:19.230
So it's probably gotta be a software business, software, hardware,

78
00:04:19.231 --> 00:04:20.550
businesses take a lot more.

79
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.150
<v 2>Venture capitals, get in the way at all the business or do,</v>

80
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.010
or is it possible to get out of the way?

81
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.971
<v 1>Yeah. If you,</v>

82
00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:29.730
if you get young venture capitalists who are starting their career,

83
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.560
they're very nervous and scared because they're putting all these bets and then

84
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.400
there's a very weird thing that happens. The bad news comes first.

85
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.470
So companies that don't work out, go out of business immediately. Yes.

86
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.940
So if it's not going to be calm or Robin hood or Uber, those take seven,

87
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.300
you know, you have, uh, one of those great successes somewhere in your five,

88
00:04:51.301 --> 00:04:54.690
six, seven, eight as an investor. What is the first five years?

89
00:04:54.691 --> 00:04:56.160
Like the first five years?

90
00:04:56.161 --> 00:05:00.720
You feel like an idiot because you let's say you make these, uh, 10 bets

91
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:03.690
in year two,

92
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.970
two or three of them come back and they don't have product market fit and

93
00:05:05.971 --> 00:05:08.400
they're out of money and they say, can we have more money? And you say, no,

94
00:05:08.401 --> 00:05:10.740
we have to go get it from somebody else because you have to prove that there's

95
00:05:10.741 --> 00:05:13.230
still a market for it. We may keep our prorata.

96
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.780
We may put a little bit into maintain our percentage ownership,

97
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.480
but we're not going to give you another big chunk of money.

98
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.120
And that company dies. So now you've got 10 million up in smoke, boom,

99
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.983
10 million up smoke.

100
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.740
So this is called the J curve where your performance goes down.

101
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.100
And then it's only in years, four or five and six, it starts going up.

102
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.960
And what you're seeing right now is the people who started like I did in 2011,

103
00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:40.830
12 years ago, in 2009, I started investing. We all look like geniuses,

104
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.590
why we're at the end of the cycle.

105
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.180
We invested after when the stock market was on the floor after the financial

106
00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:51.570
crisis. And it's gone straight up since. So everybody looked,

107
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.760
there's a couple little blips in there, but generally speaking there,

108
00:05:53.761 --> 00:05:56.640
hasn't been like a major crash, uh, with the exception of the pandemic crash,

109
00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.570
but that bounced back. And so, you know,

110
00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:01.520
it takes a decade to figure out if you're good at it.

111
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:03.830
And then if the market crashes again,

112
00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:05.960
everybody feels like an again and the cycle starts again.

113
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:08.210
So you are now as a founder,

114
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.330
you are now inserting yourself into that casino.

115
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.470
And now you've got all these other forces pushing and pulling and you're

116
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:19.040
growing. Let's say your company was growing 50%. You feel like, wow,

117
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.690
I'm successful. I made a million dollars last year.

118
00:06:20.691 --> 00:06:22.760
Now I'm doing a million and a half. And,

119
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.730
and the first thing a VC is going to you is how do we triple we're moving.

120
00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:29.180
We're growing too slow too. But that's like you said, that beautifully, uh,

121
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:34.070
is a rocket fuel. It's, uh, in, in the sense it's a kind of motivation.

122
00:06:34.071 --> 00:06:38.720
It's a dry, I mean, it's a positive if you want that, if you want that,

123
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.450
if you want that, if you want to go to Navy seal school,

124
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.160
you are going to be in pain.

125
00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:46.160
And they're going to put that hose in your face while you're underwater with

126
00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:49.340
your hands tied behind your back in the pool and you're to be choking and you

127
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.910
might have to do CPR on you. And like every couple of years, tragically,

128
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.150
somebody dies in Navy seal school. Well,

129
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.970
it doesn't mean we're getting rid of the Navy seals groggy. If he does, he does.
