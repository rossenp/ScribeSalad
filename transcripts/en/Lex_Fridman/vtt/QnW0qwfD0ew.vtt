00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.640
<v 0>Is there by way of advice,</v>

2
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.440
was funding in your own journey, helpful unhelpful,

3
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.440
like, is there a right time to get funding, venture funding, venture funding,

4
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.600
or any, anything borrow some money from your parents? I don't know, but any,

5
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.910
like is money get in the way? Does it help? Is the timing important?

6
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.990
Is there some kind of wisdom you can give there because you were exceptionally

7
00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:32.230
successful very quickly.

8
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.170
<v 1>Funding helps as long as it's from the right people that includes yourself.</v>

9
00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:43.880
And I'll talk about myself, funding myself in, in a second, which is like,

10
00:00:43.881 --> 00:00:47.080
because I can fund myself doing whatever projects I can do.

11
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.080
I don't really have another person putting pressure on me except for myself.

12
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.560
And that creates strange dynamics. Right?

13
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.880
But let's like talk about people getting funding from a venture capitalist.

14
00:00:57.881 --> 00:01:02.640
Initially, uh, we raised money from Matt Kohler at benchmark. It's brilliant

15
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.510
guy, very thoughtful. Um, and he was very helpful early on,

16
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.030
but I have stories from entrepreneurs where they raise money from the wrong

17
00:01:12.031 --> 00:01:15.310
person or the wrong firm where incentives weren't aligned.

18
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.950
They didn't think in the same way. Um, and bad things happened because of that.

19
00:01:20.951 --> 00:01:23.750
The boardroom was always noisy. There were fights.

20
00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:25.780
Like we just know ever had that. Matt was great.

21
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.300
I think use like capital these days is kind of a dime a dozen, right?

22
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.980
Like as long as you're fundable, like it seems like there's money out there is,

23
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.900
is what I'm hearing. Um,

24
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.260
it's really important to that you are aligned and that you think of raising

25
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.020
money as hiring someone for your team rather than taking money. I,

26
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.330
if capital is plentiful, right,

27
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.290
it provides a certain amount of pressure to do the right thing that I think is

28
00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:53.450
healthy for any startup.

29
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.810
And it keeps you real and honest because they don't wanna lose their money.

30
00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.250
They're paid to not lose their money. The problem, you know,

31
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.530
maybe I could depersonalize it, but like, I remember having lunch with Elon. Oh,

32
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.920
only happened once. And I asked him like,

33
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.920
I was trying to figure out what I was doing after Instagram. Right. Yeah.

34
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.560
And I asked him something about like angel investing and he looked at me with a

35
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.200
straight face and he was like, why the F would I do that? Like, why?

36
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.440
Like I was like, I don't know, like you're connected. Like seems like he's like,

37
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.790
I only invest in myself. I was like, whew. Okay. You know,

38
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.830
like not the confidence. I was just like, what a novel idea? It's like,

39
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.710
yeah. If you have money,

40
00:02:32.711 --> 00:02:36.270
like why not just put it against your bag and like yeah.

41
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.510
Enable your visiting Mars or something. Right. Like, that's awesome.

42
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.870
Great. But I had never really thought of it that way.

43
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.580
But also with that comes an interesting dynamic where, um,

44
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.740
you don't actually have people who are gonna lose that money, telling you, Hey,

45
00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:56.540
don't do this. Or, Hey, you need to face this reality.

46
00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.400
So you need to create other versions of that truth teller mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

47
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.000
And I, I, whatever I do next,

48
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.640
that's gonna be one of the interesting challenges is how do you create that

49
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.360
truth telling situation? Um, and that's part of why, by the way,

50
00:03:11.361 --> 00:03:14.600
I think someone like Jack, when you start square, you have money, but you still,

51
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.990
you bring on partners because I think it creates truth telling type environment.

52
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.070
Um, I'm still trying to figure this out. Like I like, it's an interesting,

53
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.470
it's an interesting dynamic. So you're.

54
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.350
<v 0>Thinking of perhaps launching some kind of venture where you're investing in.</v>

55
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.590
<v 1>Yourself. I mean,</v>

56
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.150
is that in the books potentially I'm 37 going on 38 next month. Uh,

57
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.870
I have a long life to live. I'm not definitely not gonna sit on the meeting.

58
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.780
Right. So I'm gonna do something at some point.

59
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.700
And I gotta imagine I will, I will like help fund it. Right.

60
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.060
So the other way of thinking about this is you could park your money in the S

61
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.900
and P and this is bad, cuz the S and P's done wonderfully well last year, right.

62
00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.450
Or you can invest in yourself and, um, if not gonna invest in yourself,

63
00:04:00.451 --> 00:04:03.410
you probably shouldn't do a startup. It's kind of the way of thinking about it.

64
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.690
<v 0>And you can invest in yourself in the way Elon does, which is basically, uh,</v>

65
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.290
go all in on this investment.

66
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.250
&lt;laugh&gt; maybe that's one way to achieve accountability is like,

67
00:04:13.251 --> 00:04:14.650
you're kind of screwed if you're.

68
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.570
<v 1>If you fail, man. Yeah. That's yeah.</v>

69
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:24.240
<v 0>I, I per like that. I like burning bridges behind me so that I'm if it fails.</v>

70
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.680
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; yeah. Yeah. Um, it's really important though. There,</v>

71
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.480
one of the things I think mark said to me early on that, that sticks with me,

72
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:38.800
that I think is true. Uh, we were talking about people who had left,

73
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.670
like operating roles and started doing adventure or something. And he was like,

74
00:04:41.671 --> 00:04:43.870
a lot of people convince themselves. They work really hard.

75
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.790
Like they think they work really hard and they,

76
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.550
they put on the show and in their minds, they work really hard,

77
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.310
but they don't work very hard. There is something about lighting,

78
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.750
a fire underneath you and burning bridges such that you can't turn back. Yeah.

79
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.670
That I think, you know, we didn't talk about this specifically,

80
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.020
but I think you're right there is you need to have that because

81
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.340
there's this self delusion at a certain scale. Oh, I have so many board calls.

82
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.420
Oh, like we have all these things to figure out. It's like, Hmm,

83
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.340
this is one of the hard parts about it being an operator. It's like,

84
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.260
there are so many people that have made a lot of money not,

85
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.690
but operating is just one of the hardest things on earth.

86
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.330
It is just so effing hard. &lt;laugh&gt; it is stressful. It is.

87
00:05:29.331 --> 00:05:30.650
You're dealing with real humans.

88
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.610
You're not just like throwing capital in and hoping it grows.

89
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.850
I'm not undermining the VC mindset. I think it's a wonderful thing and needed.

90
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.680
And, and so many wonderful VCs I've worked with. But, um, yeah,

91
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.640
like when your S is on the line and it's your money, it's

92
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.440
talk to me in 10 years. We'll see how it goes. &lt;laugh&gt;.

93
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.080
<v 0>Yeah. But like you were saying that as a source,</v>

94
00:05:53.081 --> 00:05:54.920
when you wake up in the morning as a,

95
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.320
and you look forward to the day full of challenges,

96
00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.360
that's also where you can find happiness.
