00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.300
<v 0>Do you think there's an objective function that describes the entirety of, uh,</v>

2
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:10.740
human life. So, you know,

3
00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:15.060
usually the way that you ask that is what is the meaning of life? Is there, um,

4
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.380
a universal objective function that captures the why of life?

5
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.610
<v 1>So, yeah, I mean, I suspect that the deal ask this question,</v>

6
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.650
but it's ask that question that I ask myself many, many times. See,

7
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.450
I can tell you a framework that I have these days.

8
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.330
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; to think about this question.

9
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.970
<v 2>So I think that fundamentally meaning of life has to do with</v>

10
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.690
some of our reward actions that we have in brain,

11
00:00:38.691 --> 00:00:41.810
and they might have to do with, let's say for instance,

12
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.720
curiosity or, uh, human connection, which might mean understanding others,

13
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.400
uh, uh,

14
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.640
it's also possible for a person to slightly modify their reward function.

15
00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:55.920
Usually they, they mostly stay fixed,

16
00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:57.920
but it's possible to modify reward function.

17
00:00:57.921 --> 00:01:00.600
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and you can pretty much choose. So in some sense,

18
00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:02.760
reward functions, optimizing reward functions,

19
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.750
they will give you like of satisfaction.

20
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.270
<v 0>Is there some randomness in the.</v>

21
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.750
<v 1>Function? I think when you are born, there is some randomness.</v>

22
00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:12.790
Like you can see that some people, for instance, they,

23
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.750
they care more about building stuff.

24
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.150
Some people care more about caring for others.

25
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.950
Some people there are all sorts of, uh, default reward functions.

26
00:01:22.951 --> 00:01:26.740
And then in some sense, you can ask a yourself, was this like a, uh,

27
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.340
what is the satisfying way for you to go after this reward function?

28
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.500
And you just go after this reward function.

29
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.340
<v 2>And you know, some people ask, ask are these reward functions real?</v>

30
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.230
I almost think about it as let's say,

31
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.500
if you would have to discover mathematics in mathematics,

32
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.580
you are likely to run into various objects like a complex numbers or

33
00:01:51.581 --> 00:01:53.900
differentiation some other objects.

34
00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:57.380
And these are very natural objects that arise. And similarly,

35
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.020
the reward functions that we are having in our brain,

36
00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:02.500
they are somewhat very natural that, uh, you know,

37
00:02:02.501 --> 00:02:06.330
there is a reward function for understanding

38
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.250
like a comprehension. Yeah. Uh, uh, curiosity and so on. So in some sense,

39
00:02:12.251 --> 00:02:16.930
they are in, uh, same way natural as their natural objects in mathematics.

40
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.130
<v 0>Interesting. So, you know, there's the, uh,</v>

41
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.410
the old sort of debate is mathematics invented or discovered,

42
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.680
you're saying reward functions are discovered. So nature.

43
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.120
<v 1>So nature provided some, you can still let's say expand it throughout the life.</v>

44
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.400
Some of the reward functions, they might be futile. Like for instance,

45
00:02:34.401 --> 00:02:38.720
there might be a reward function, maximize amount of wealth. Yeah.

46
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.640
And this is more like a, a learning reward function. And,

47
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.520
but we know also that some reward functions, if you optimize them

48
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.023
quite sad fight.

49
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.950
<v 0>Well,</v>

50
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.990
I don't know which part of your reward function resulted in you coming today,

51
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.070
but I am deeply appreciative that you did spend your valuable time with me.

52
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.120
Wal check is, is really fun talking to you. You're, you're brilliant.

53
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.400
You're a good human being.

54
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.080
And it's an honor to meet you and an honor to talk to you.

55
00:03:07.081 --> 00:03:08.200
Thanks for talking today, brother.

56
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.720
<v 1>Thank you L I appreciate your questions. Your, I had a lot of time being here.</v>
