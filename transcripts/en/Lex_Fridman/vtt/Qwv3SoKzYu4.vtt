1
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.560
<v 0>You are a scholar of religious belief or a belief in general.</v>

2
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.800
So the fascinating question, uh,

3
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.400
what do you think is the difference between our beliefs and objective

4
00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:16.480
reality? What is real.

5
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.920
<v 1>Period? Sure. What is real easy question?</v>

6
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.880
&lt;laugh&gt; so first let me start with belief.

7
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.310
So belief is generally, there are different definitions of belief,

8
00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:31.990
just, just as there are different definitions of what is real. Okay.

9
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.390
So for belief in my field,

10
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.990
it would be attitudes toward something that dictate our actions.

11
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.230
Okay. So we believe the sun is gonna rise tomorrow.

12
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.500
Therefore we act as if it will rise tomorrow. All right.

13
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.260
Beliefs can be wrong for a long time.

14
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.820
People believed and actually some still do that.

15
00:00:51.821 --> 00:00:56.260
<v 2>The earth was flat. Okay. Well, that's obviously an erroneous belief,</v>

16
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.020
so beliefs can be wrong. Uh, now the,

17
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.420
the bigger question that philosophers ask is, um, does,

18
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.850
is this belief if accurate toward what we consider to be objective reality.

19
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.010
So now let me go to objective reality. So what is real?

20
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.650
I don't think we can actually obtain a correct understanding of

21
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:17.530
what is real.

22
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.650
<v 1>And in that sense, I have to refer to a philosopher again,</v>

23
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.840
and that would be Emmanuel con. So Emmanuel con is one of the,

24
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.520
he was, uh, basically in the 1750s,

25
00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:32.360
he wrote critiques of reason and things like that. So he said, well,

26
00:01:32.361 --> 00:01:36.400
if you're a philosopher or have any kind of understanding of Western history,

27
00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:37.720
you know who he is, um,

28
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.880
he had this idea that we can actually never get to the thing in it in itself.

29
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.870
Okay. So, and he called that the nominal, the, a thing in itself, he said, this,

30
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.110
let's take this table for instance, that you and I are talking across.

31
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.790
So this thing is a table. You and I both know that we assume it's real.

32
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.070
We believe in it because we put our water on it and our water stays on it. Okay.

33
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.470
Um, however, can we know this thing, um, in and of itself as a table? Um,

34
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.580
so that be what he then would call, um, the phenomenal,

35
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.500
how do we know that that phenomena exists as we know it is

36
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.020
okay. How, how do we know? Uh, we use our faculties.

37
00:02:17.021 --> 00:02:19.540
So we use our senses and things like that. But again,

38
00:02:19.541 --> 00:02:20.820
even our census can be wrong.

39
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.700
So I've been on committees just recently this year,

40
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.210
year for hiring professors in my department who are philosophers and

41
00:02:31.211 --> 00:02:33.970
every, and we're hiring meta physicians and, you know,

42
00:02:33.971 --> 00:02:37.570
people who are thinking about the nature of reality &lt;laugh&gt; and basically what,

43
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.450
what I've learned from them. Yeah. They're very, I'd.

44
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.210
<v 0>Love to attend those faculty talks. &lt;laugh&gt; metaphysics professors.</v>

45
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.410
<v 1>What's funny. Is that so great for each one of them?</v>

46
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.680
I'm convinced each time they all say different things,

47
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.800
but they're so convincing. I'm like, yes, hire that one. Right.

48
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.200
<v 0>Is it like historical philosophy? Like particular topic? No. What do they, no,</v>

49
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.120
they're they have an actual belief they're practicing meta.

50
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.780
<v 1>Physicians. Yes.</v>

51
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.960
So what they do is they come and they're usually excellent philosophers from

52
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.600
Harvard or, you know, uh, USC or whatever, you know,

53
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:14.120
they come and they give what's called a job talk. That's what philosoph. Well,

54
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.200
every academic does a job talk in order to get a, um,

55
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.710
they talk to us about a department about what they do.

56
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.070
And so it so happens that we need a me meta physician,

57
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.710
and now we're hiring again for one.

58
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.710
And so I've L I've learned a lot about metaphysics in the last year,

59
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.670
and this is what I've learned, um,

60
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.670
that they use physics as a basis for understanding what we can

61
00:03:37.671 --> 00:03:41.980
know about what is real and what is real is really difficult to pin down.

62
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.420
And so your question is, what is belief? Well,

63
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.100
belief does it correspond to reality? That's the question I would ask.

64
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.380
And first we don't even know what is real. So the table, they would say,

65
00:03:53.381 --> 00:03:55.340
how do we know that the table even exists? Well,

66
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.180
how do we differentiate it from the floor, for example?

67
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.770
So these are the questions that philosophers are asking. No one else's,

68
00:04:01.771 --> 00:04:02.350
of course,

69
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.610
but philosophers are asking these questions and they have different answers for

70
00:04:05.611 --> 00:04:10.050
it. So I would say that it's very difficult to know what is real. And in fact,

71
00:04:10.051 --> 00:04:15.010
what I do usually is I paraphrase my friend, um, and colleague,

72
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.330
brother, guy, conman, he's a Jesuit priest.

73
00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.240
Who's also an astronomer and he's the director of the Vatican observatory.

74
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.960
And so he says, this he's a very smart person. He says, well,

75
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.600
truth is a moving target, you know? So,

76
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.520
so basically to know what is real out there like

77
00:04:34.521 --> 00:04:37.640
gravity or something like that, you've got to approximate it.

78
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.790
And as human beings, you know, we have, um, senses to tell us what,

79
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.070
at least so we don't get hurt. You know,

80
00:04:45.071 --> 00:04:47.910
we're not gonna fall off a building or something like that.

81
00:04:47.911 --> 00:04:51.990
We have eyes to see and things like that. So we can approximate what reality is,

82
00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:54.150
but we're never gonna get to it. Um,

83
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.710
unless we develop better senses. Okay.

84
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.550
And I think that that is what we are in the process of doing,

85
00:05:00.551 --> 00:05:04.740
we're developing better senses. We have telescopes, we have microscopes,

86
00:05:04.741 --> 00:05:08.420
we have, you know, extensions of ourselves, which are now called technology.

87
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.660
And we can get to a better understanding of what reality is and what

88
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.820
the objective world is.

89
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.940
And therefore our beliefs can be honed so we can get better beliefs,

90
00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:22.650
more accurate beliefs, but can we get beliefs that actually spawn to reality?

91
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.810
Um, not in any precise way, but in approximate ways.
