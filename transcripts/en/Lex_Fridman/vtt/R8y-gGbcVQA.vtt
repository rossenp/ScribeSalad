00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.990
<v 0>But the incredible thing about you. I, I just, uh, recently talked, uh,</v>

2
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.230
spent a couple days with Jimmy Pedro, and, uh,

3
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.870
he talked about his guys and just champions in general,

4
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.310
hating to lose more than they love winning mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

5
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.620
And the way you talked about losing, you lost very few times a in your career,

6
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.620
like later, you, you were dominating both the arresting and MMA,

7
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.140
but the way you took these losses against people that are, I don't know,

8
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:34.860
below elite level.

9
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.940
<v 1>It's fair. &lt;laugh&gt; I was gonna get pissy, but, but I's completely fair.</v>

10
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.340
I thought he was a bump too. No, that's not.

11
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.173
<v 0>What I meant.</v>

12
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.250
<v 1>It's okay. No, it's good. No.</v>

13
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.610
<v 0>No, no. Um, no, no, but like what can you explain the psychology behind that?</v>

14
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.690
Like the, what is there, um, a system behind this?

15
00:00:53.691 --> 00:00:54.730
Is there philosophy behind.

16
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.330
<v 1>This? Well, I, I wasn't very good in the beginning and I think,</v>

17
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.370
I think that's where all starts from,

18
00:01:00.371 --> 00:01:04.440
so I didn't start getting good until the age of like 13. I started at five.

19
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.400
I probably started competing more at age 10, 11.

20
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.680
Didn't really get good until 13 and still at 13 I'm I'm it's not great.

21
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.521
I'm getting better.

22
00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:16.360
<v 2>Right? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I'm pretty good. Um, so I actually, I have actually,</v>

23
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.000
I have running this book on sports psych, but this it's I got, well,

24
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:22.240
I got someone write it for me kind of thing. Uh,

25
00:01:22.241 --> 00:01:24.400
cause I've had this philosophy for years that there's,

26
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.910
there has to be this balance between two things. Right? So on the one hand, in,

27
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:28.763
in this category,

28
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.430
on the one hand you have hate and to lose a great champion has to hate to lose,

29
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.293
like you said, right?

30
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.870
<v 1>Yeah. But on this other hand, you have to have someone who seeks out challenges.</v>

31
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.350
Right. Cuz if you don't have that,

32
00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:43.150
you're never gonna reach your full potential either. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

33
00:01:43.151 --> 00:01:46.660
And so you have to balance these two balls at the same time. Right?

34
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.860
And so like for me, I always, and, and this is maybe, cause I wasn't good,

35
00:01:50.861 --> 00:01:53.980
but I was always like, let me go find the best people to wrestle all the time.

36
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.140
Let me go find like, I would like literally, uh, like seventh,

37
00:01:57.141 --> 00:01:59.420
eighth grade when I was starting to get better, it was like,

38
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.260
and this there's an internet. Well, there was no one was using the internet.

39
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.060
It was like a wrestling magazine and like, Hey dad, there's a tournament here.

40
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.850
I, I think that are the kids gonna be there?

41
00:02:06.851 --> 00:02:09.650
Can you take me two hours across the state today? Please? Mm-hmm.

42
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.570
<v 0>&lt;Affirmative&gt; you would wrestle like in competition against.</v>

43
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.810
<v 1>Them? Not in competition. Yeah. Yeah. In competition. Hey,</v>

44
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.650
I heard there's this tournament. Here's the magazine. There's this tournament.

45
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.290
Hey dad, will you take me over there.

46
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.970
<v 0>Tomorrow? You, you weren't trying to win. You were trying to get the.</v>

47
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.930
<v 1>Experience. I was trying to wrestle the best guys. Maybe I win.</v>

48
00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:27.240
Maybe I lose there's no. When you used to do a competition,

49
00:02:27.241 --> 00:02:31.240
there's no guarantee of a winner, a loss. You're just doing competition. Right?

50
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.360
So I, I wanted to go,

51
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.720
I wanted to challenge myself against the best guys mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; of which

52
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.640
I thought maybe I could come out on top. Right? So like eighth grade year,

53
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.640
I won way. You know, I probably lost a handful of time.

54
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.320
<v 2>Times in the state of w was state, Wisconsin was probably really,</v>

55
00:02:44.321 --> 00:02:46.080
really minimal. The amount of times I lost, you know,

56
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.910
was just about getting the challenge. And it's like some,

57
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.030
some kids and not kids in my club. Cause I'll, I'll push. 'em very hard on,

58
00:02:53.031 --> 00:02:54.910
this are scared of challenging themselves.

59
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.070
They like being the big fish in this small pond. They're not willing to go say,

60
00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.481
I'm gonna,

61
00:02:59.481 --> 00:03:02.560
I wanna go get that guy and I wanna get that guy and I wanna get that guy.

62
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.880
And so that's like, so I think that's part of it for me is like,

63
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.440
I always just love the challenge. I enjoy competing thoroughly. Right.

64
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.640
And I understood from a young age because it wasn't a good losings,

65
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:14.000
a part of it. You're not always gonna win.
