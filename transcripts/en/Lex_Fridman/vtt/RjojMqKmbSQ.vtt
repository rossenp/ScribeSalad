00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.140
<v 0>What do you is the most beautiful speaking of hyenas? Uh,</v>

2
00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:09.900
what do you use the most beautiful, uh,

3
00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:13.420
nature inspired algorithm in your work that you've come across?

4
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.620
Something maybe earlier on in your work or maybe today?

5
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.660
<v 1>I, I think it evolution, uh, computation is the most amazing method.</v>

6
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.690
So what, what fascinates me most is that, uh,

7
00:00:26.691 --> 00:00:30.970
with computers is that you can, you can get more out than you put in. I mean,

8
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.010
you can write a piece of code and your machine does what you told it. I mean,

9
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.970
this happened to me my freshman year.

10
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.770
It did something very simple and I was just amazed.

11
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.050
<v 2>I was blown away that it would,</v>

12
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.240
it would get the number and it would go compute the, the result.

13
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:48.240
And I didn't have to do it myself, very simple. Uh,

14
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.080
but if you push that a little further,

15
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.680
you can have machines that learn and they might learn patterns, uh,

16
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.080
and already say deep learning neural networks,

17
00:00:57.081 --> 00:01:00.840
they can learn to recognize objects sounds, um,

18
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.510
patterns that humans have trouble with. And so they do it better than humans.

19
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.030
<v 1>And that's so fascinating. And now if you take that one more step,</v>

20
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.350
you get something like evolution algorithms that discover things,

21
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.030
they create things. They come up with solutions that you did not think of.

22
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.310
And that just blows me away.

23
00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:23.070
It's so great that we can build systems algorithms that can be in some

24
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:24.630
sense smarter than we are.

25
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.620
It can discover solutions that we might miss mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. Um,

26
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.940
a lot of times it is because we have as humans, we have certain biases,

27
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.780
we expect the solutions to be certain way,

28
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.300
and you don't put those biases into the algorithm,

29
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.740
so they are more free to explore.

30
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.460
And evolution is just absolutely fantastic Explorer. And that's what,

31
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.940
what really is fascinating.

32
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.850
<v 0>Yeah. I think, uh, I get made fun of a bit,</v>

33
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.130
cause I currently don't have any kids, but you mentioned programs. I mean,

34
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.650
um, do you have kids? Yeah. So maybe you could speak to this,

35
00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.530
but there's a magic to the creation creative process. Like I, uh, with,

36
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.810
with spot the Boston dynamic spot,

37
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.730
but really in your robot that I ever worked on,

38
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.880
it just feels like the similar kind of joy I imagine I would have as a father,

39
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.280
not the same perhaps level, but like the same kind of wonderment,

40
00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:17.360
like that's exactly this, which is like, you know,

41
00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:22.280
what you had to do initially, uh, to get this thing going, uh,

42
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.240
let this speak on the computer science side, like what the program looks like,

43
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.270
but something about it, uh,

44
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.310
doing more than what the program was written on paper is,

45
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.190
is like that somehow connects to the magic of this entire universe.

46
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.070
Like that's, that's like, I,

47
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.630
I feel like I found God every time I like it's like, uh, cause you're,

48
00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:50.300
you've really created something that's living. Yeah. Even if it's, it has a.

49
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.860
<v 1>Life of its own has the intelligent of its own.</v>

50
00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:54.980
It's beyond what you actually thought. Yeah. And that is,

51
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.620
I think it's exactly spot on. That's exactly what it's about. Uh,

52
00:02:58.621 --> 00:03:03.080
you created something and has a, a ability to, uh, live its life and,

53
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.240
and do good things. And, um, you just gave it a starting point.

54
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.280
So in that sense, I think it's, that may be part of the joy actually.
