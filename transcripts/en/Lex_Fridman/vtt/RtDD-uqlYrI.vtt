00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.710
<v 0>What, what do you think? Uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.190
the biggest since we're covering every single possible topic for me ask the

3
00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:10.860
biggest one, the unanswerable one,

4
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.090
from the perspective of alien intelligence or from the perspective of religious

5
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:18.030
studies or from the perspective of just Diana,

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.950
what do you think is the meaning of this existence of, uh,

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.150
this life of ours?

8
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.470
<v 1>Yes. Okay. So, all right. So.</v>

9
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.690
<v 0>Well of.</v>

10
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:30.680
<v 1>Course I have to,</v>

11
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.480
my philosophical training as a undergrad always makes me

12
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.110
think about, like, what's the assumption in your question.

13
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.950
There's an assumption there it's like, there is a meaning. Okay.

14
00:00:42.951 --> 00:00:43.784
That's the assumption.

15
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.400
<v 0>What do you mean by life? You define the terms.</v>

16
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.070
<v 1>No, no, but listen. Okay. I'll answer your question.</v>

17
00:00:49.071 --> 00:00:51.770
I'm just going to say that there's this assumption that we should have meaning

18
00:00:51.771 --> 00:00:55.430
to life. Okay. Well maybe we should. We shouldn't, maybe it was just all random.

19
00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:59.360
Okay. However, I believe that it's not, and in my opinion,

20
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.460
on the meaning of life, in my opinion is an intrinsic. I enjoy living.

21
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.180
I want to live sometimes I don't enjoy living. And when I don't enjoy living,

22
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.030
I change my circumstances. So it's intrinsic.

23
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.600
And I think that certain things are intrinsic and like, love,

24
00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:18.770
love of your children is kind of, um, well, it's actually a physiological,

25
00:01:18.771 --> 00:01:21.350
but it's also intrinsic. It's beautiful. You know,

26
00:01:21.351 --> 00:01:25.610
there's something about it that that is intrinsically,

27
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.760
um, desirable. So the,

28
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.880
I think the meaning of life is like that intrinsically designed.

29
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.920
<v 0>So it's something that just was born inside you</v>

30
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.450
based on, um, what makes you feel good?

31
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.030
<v 1>No, that's hedonism. That's.</v>

32
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.200
<v 0>It's about what, uh, where do you place love, love, love of your children.</v>

33
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.750
<v 1>Yeah. So basically, um,</v>

34
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.790
loving your children by the way is not always easy because they do things that

35
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.040
they shouldn't do. You have to discipline them.

36
00:01:58.041 --> 00:02:01.130
That's one of the worst things about Parenthood to me is disciplining my

37
00:02:01.131 --> 00:02:04.160
children. I don't like to do that. I love them. Um,

38
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.290
so a lot of things that I do that I feel are

39
00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:14.270
good are not easy. So there's an intrinsic sense that like,

40
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.860
okay, let's take, um, animals. Okay. So we have dogs and cats. Okay.

41
00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:22.190
So you might not, but I do, I've, you know, I told you about them.

42
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.300
<v 0>Can you, can you, can you, uh, share their names?</v>

43
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.030
<v 1>If I share their names, I will share their names. Okay.</v>

44
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.220
So we have a cat and it has red, fluffy hair. And so we called it Trump.

45
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.210
Well, when we got our dog, we figured that it needed a companion.

46
00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:41.360
So we called it Putin. So we have Trump and Putin.

47
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.780
<v 0>Greatest pet names of all time. I'm sorry.</v>

48
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.350
And, uh, or maybe we'll be able to share a picture of your cat,

49
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.880
cause this is awesome. Very photogenic.

50
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.540
Uh, I mean this something that's, uh, whether LA, uh, what,

51
00:03:02.541 --> 00:03:06.220
whether we're talking about love or the intrinsic meaning,

52
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.990
do you think that's something that's really special to humans

53
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.400
or if there is intelligent alien civilizations out there,

54
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.350
do you think that's something that they possess as well? Um,

55
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.720
maybe in different forms, like whatever,

56
00:03:22.721 --> 00:03:27.160
this thing that meaning is this inter

57
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.770
instrinsic drive that we have, do you think that's just a property of life,

58
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.870
of some level of complexity that we will see that everywhere in this

59
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:38.704
universe.

60
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.830
<v 1>In my opinion, and this is just my opinion. Um, I, I do think that it is,</v>

61
00:03:43.831 --> 00:03:48.000
but I also think that it could take different forms. So if there is like, uh,

62
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.170
think of gravity, right? Gravity kind of like make stuff, stick to it, right.

63
00:03:52.171 --> 00:03:56.490
It could track stuff. Well, what is love do you that does that too. Right?

64
00:03:56.491 --> 00:04:00.300
So people who are CR we call them cruise Matic, charism.

65
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.480
It means love charism means light and love.

66
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.520
So a charismatic person is a person who attracts people to them,

67
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.150
like the sun does. Right. Like, you know, so, um,

68
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.630
so I think that whatever this property is,

69
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.090
that's intrinsic is like gravity.

70
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.950
And most likely it takes different forms in different types of life forms.

71
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.380
<v 0>Yeah. I can't wait until like, uh,</v>

72
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.660
Albert Einstein type of figure in the future will discover that love is in fact,

73
00:04:30.661 --> 00:04:34.140
one of the fundamental forces of physics. That would be cool,

74
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.540
Anna. And this is one of the favorite conversations I've ever had.

75
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.010
It's truly an honor to talk to you and thank you so much for spending all this

76
00:04:44.011 --> 00:04:44.100
time.
