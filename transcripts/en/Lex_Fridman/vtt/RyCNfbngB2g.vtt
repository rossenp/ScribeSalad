1
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.970
<v 0>I think this is a really good example of a difficult figure.</v>

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.240
That's controversial that people bring up to me a lot.

3
00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:10.770
And you interviewed twice,

4
00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:15.750
which is courtesy Arvin mentioned small, AKA mentioned small bug,

5
00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:19.410
which is his pseudonym that he goes by is his blog.

6
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.580
Can you tell me about who he is? Sure. Why is he interesting?

7
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:25.170
What of his ideas are interesting.

8
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.250
<v 1>Briefly? He invented the concept of the red pill.</v>

9
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.590
So Curtis mentioned mobile blog had a blog called unqualified reservations.

10
00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:36.590
You can still find it online. It's very verbose.

11
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.820
He writes at length very, very bright. Um,

12
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.090
his perspective is very heretical.

13
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.370
So a lot of things that we take for granted in our liberal democracy, uh,

14
00:00:49.371 --> 00:00:53.240
he regards is not only incorrect, which is downright absurd and does not.

15
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.250
He does not take what many people view as the basis of

16
00:00:58.251 --> 00:01:02.090
American political discourse as the basis for his thought.

17
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.943
So

18
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.010
when you're starting with someone who is basically repudiating, uh,

19
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.470
kind of the Western worldview, we're not the Western world.

20
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.520
You'd like the American [inaudible]. A lot of people are gonna, of course,

21
00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:20.960
regard him as dangerous or, uh, someone who was verboten. Um,

22
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.020
he's a very bright person. Um.

23
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.300
<v 0>Why is he such a toxic figure?</v>

24
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.240
<v 1>Because if you are blue pills,</v>

25
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.620
if you are the guardians of what is

26
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.780
acceptable discourse, then you have to make sure your forts are secured.

27
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.180
And that any figure outside of this acceptable discourse has to be marginalized

28
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.850
and regarded as radioactive as possible.

29
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.470
You don't want to let in these kind of ideas,

30
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.850
that would be destructive to your headlamp.

31
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.190
<v 0>Well, so let's dig into it.</v>

32
00:01:55.191 --> 00:01:58.430
So like he I've read a few things by him,

33
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.660
but then I hear that in a bunch of places,

34
00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:06.740
him being called a racist, a white supremacist, new fascist.

35
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.120
So on I go to his Wikipedia. Yeah.

36
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.100
There's a view on race section. Let me, let me read it. Okay.

37
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.940
You Garvin's opinions have been described as racist with his writings

38
00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:21.950
interpreted as supportive of slavery,

39
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.150
including the belief that whites have higher IQs than blacks for genetic

40
00:02:26.151 --> 00:02:26.984
reasons.

41
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.300
The Arvin himself maintains that he's not a racist because while he doubts

42
00:02:32.301 --> 00:02:34.520
that quote, all races are equally smart.

43
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.290
The notion quote that people who score higher on IQ tests and in some sense,

44
00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:41.750
superior human beings is quote creepy.

45
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.030
He also disputes being an outspoken advocate for slavery, though.

46
00:02:47.031 --> 00:02:51.710
He has argued that some races are more suited for slavery than others. Quote,

47
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.120
it should be obvious that although I'm not a white supremacy, white nationalist,

48
00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.300
I am not exactly allergic to the stuff you Arvin wrote in a post that linked

49
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.260
approvingly of, I don't know these people, Steve sailor. Sailor. Yeah.

50
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.550
He's from Jared Taylor and other racialists. Yeah. So, okay.

51
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:11.680
So like w w why my question is.

52
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.020
<v 1>Well,</v>

53
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.460
let me just say one sentence in the same way that you had,

54
00:03:17.461 --> 00:03:18.450
you were mentioned that guy earlier,

55
00:03:18.451 --> 00:03:20.520
who was defending some aspects of communism,

56
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.760
and that is in some contexts acceptable.

57
00:03:23.761 --> 00:03:26.790
When you think about it's like this should be radioactive, right?

58
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.570
The fact that he is engaging with these ideas, uh,

59
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.980
in anything other than this has to be repeated at all costs is what renders him

60
00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:36.600
to large extent racist.

61
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.840
<v 0>That's really interesting.</v>

62
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.810
So there are some topics you can be nuanced and nuanced and some not.

63
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.160
And communism is still a topic that you can be nuanced about, right?

64
00:03:47.161 --> 00:03:50.700
It's difficult, but you can be a race in this,

65
00:03:50.701 --> 00:03:55.590
like talking about slavery and IQ differences based on race is a

66
00:03:55.591 --> 00:04:00.330
topic that I guess is radioactive to a degree where you can't

67
00:04:00.331 --> 00:04:01.500
even say anything,

68
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.780
even if it's like nuanced or not even like

69
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.380
making a point, it's like touching it as you make another point. Yeah.

70
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.070
<v 1>And understandably, because you can understand that I'm going to steal man the,</v>

71
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.770
the their point. Cause you can understand the point. It's like,

72
00:04:16.771 --> 00:04:19.860
you're just talking about Hitler. Once this foot gets in the door,

73
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.970
that some people are inherently slaves or some people are inherently better than

74
00:04:23.971 --> 00:04:26.940
others. It really quickly, you know, collapses.

75
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.170
So that would be their perspective.

76
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.250
<v 0>Like if I were to give criticism of his.</v>

77
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.100
<v 1>Let me just say one more thing. Racist is also used to describe Alex Jones.</v>

78
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.900
Alex, doesn't talk about race.

79
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.240
Racist is a shorthand for a certain percentage of the population to

80
00:04:42.241 --> 00:04:43.110
let you know,

81
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.970
do not bother investing in this person any further they're off limits.

82
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.630
Definitely.

83
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.350
<v 0>Racism and sexism is a thing that's not used to shut down conversation.</v>

84
00:04:52.351 --> 00:04:54.630
That's quite absurd. Uh, by, by small percent.

85
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.410
<v 1>Jared Taylor and Steve sailor at Jared Taylor interviewed him for my book.</v>

86
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.190
He would be regarded in any sense as a racist. What's.

87
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.500
<v 0>The difference between racist and racialists. So.</v>

88
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.000
<v 1>Racial lists, I mean,</v>

89
00:05:06.001 --> 00:05:08.580
this is splitting hairs and now I'm going to be all radioactive.

90
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.810
Jared Taylor runs into called Amarin. And this is, I mean,

91
00:05:12.811 --> 00:05:16.350
his perspective is that there are inherent differences for the races and you

92
00:05:16.351 --> 00:05:20.940
cannot live side by side. Um, well, whites and blacks should not be living.

93
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.780
<v 0>And by the way, for people who don't know, this is out of context,</v>

94
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.160
you have written a great book that includes some of these concepts called the

95
00:05:29.161 --> 00:05:32.610
new right. Which is not includes these concepts, but talks about, yeah. Well,

96
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.330
it's more about the growth of the, the community, uh,

97
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.100
around the, the alt-right and all those kinds of things.

98
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.600
<v 1>Right? So,</v>

99
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.730
and his point about IQ it's like if you had a population, the Dutch,

100
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.330
right. I think that the tallest people on the earth, and if you said, well,

101
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.630
the Dutch are the best people on earth. Why? Because they're the tallest.

102
00:05:54.631 --> 00:05:56.400
It's like, you're a crazy person.

103
00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.110
So if is scoring low an individual on an IQ test,

104
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.200
that means there's somehow a lower quality person. Well,

105
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:07.310
maybe one very specific aspect, but I mean, if there are good human being,

106
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:09.860
I've got friends who are low IQ. All my friends are like, you're frankly,

107
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:13.940
compared to me, sounded like Trump there for a second. Well,

108
00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:15.860
I don't have any other choices. No, one's going to be at my level.

109
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.540
<v 0>You're the smartest person since Abraham Lincoln, that I've,</v>

110
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.493
that I've ever seen.

111
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.290
<v 1>Unlike him, I actually am honest. So,</v>

112
00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.570
so he is someone who very much swims in heretical

113
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.430
ideas, Aristotle.

114
00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.630
Here's another thing like if you bring up that Aristotle said that some people

115
00:06:34.631 --> 00:06:36.850
are born to be slaves. He wasn't speaking about race.

116
00:06:36.851 --> 00:06:41.560
He was just meant people's souls, HL, Mencken, who was a great heretic in and,

117
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.130
uh, uh, early 20th century figure. Uh,

118
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.050
one of his quotes that I say all the time,

119
00:06:47.051 --> 00:06:50.320
which people have seen a lot in this past year that the average man does not

120
00:06:50.321 --> 00:06:54.720
want to be free. He merely wants to be safe. That I think is, I don't know,

121
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:59.770
I'm not familiar with what Mudbug is saying about slavery because his writing is

122
00:06:59.771 --> 00:07:00.604
ponderous.

123
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.210
But that certainly is something I think that is undeniable that I think more

124
00:07:04.211 --> 00:07:07.750
people are realizing there's a large percent of the population that is actively

125
00:07:07.751 --> 00:07:10.900
disinterested in freedom. And the more responsibilities that entails.

126
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.170
<v 0>Well, I mean, really, it's just the word slavery.</v>

127
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:18.550
If you want to make some kind of point or even think about the topic

128
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.290
outside the context of this is a horrible thing that happened in the United

129
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:23.410
States.

130
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.200
<v 1>History and other country's history. So let's be clear.</v>

131
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.990
<v 0>I mean, very important then there's slavery going on today.</v>

132
00:07:28.991 --> 00:07:31.690
And then a lot of people argue that, uh, uh,

133
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.030
sex trafficking and all those kinds of things. I mean, there's,

134
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:39.010
there's atrocities going on today that, you know, uh,

135
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:43.780
talking about it in a way that's not immediately saying this is the most

136
00:07:43.781 --> 00:07:47.110
horrible thing that happened ever. You know,

137
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.710
it's something I think about a lot is like,

138
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.600
if I want to say something controversial,

139
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:57.460
I should do so with skill with care.

140
00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.290
And only about things I care about.

141
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.770
<v 1>Well, here's where I would disagree. I not, when I say things,</v>

142
00:08:02.771 --> 00:08:04.570
I often say things that are controversial,

143
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.650
or I will say uncontroversial things in a controversial way,

144
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:13.120
because it's a useful mechanism to alienate people you don't want around you.

145
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:18.340
Because if there are people who are going to be shocked by certain topics,

146
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.730
like we should have ended world war II, like even as a hypothesis,

147
00:08:21.731 --> 00:08:23.050
they just clutch their pearls. They're like, Oh,

148
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.310
you want the Holocaust to happen?

149
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.810
I can't discuss most things with you because you're not interested in having

150
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.850
conversations. You're interested in your emotional response. Yeah.

151
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.060
<v 0>I think I see things differently. Maybe this is a bit of a devil's advocate,</v>

152
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:38.560
but what in at least the modern discourse of like Twitter and social media and

153
00:08:38.561 --> 00:08:42.550
so on. I find that if you do that, you're not actually

154
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.890
removing the people that are not thoughtful and kind and so on.

155
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.880
You're actually attracting loud people like a small number of them.

156
00:08:51.881 --> 00:08:55.560
They come over and start yelling at, you start yelling there,

157
00:08:55.561 --> 00:09:00.120
basically ruin the party by showing up and just

158
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.550
screaming. And so all the thoughtful people leave.

159
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.970
<v 1>Well, that's why you have to be a very heavy blocker.</v>

160
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.450
You have to block people on Twitter because you have to cultivate your audience

161
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.180
and have them. Like a lot of times people come at me, I don't care.

162
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.330
Then they'll start attacking members of my audience. And then I'm like, dang,

163
00:09:14.331 --> 00:09:17.270
I got to block them because they've won this one. Cause I can't have that.

164
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:21.590
<v 0>Yeah. I don't. I on,</v>

165
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:26.610
on necessarily provoking people feels, um.

166
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.830
<v 1>It's, it's it's this is beta testing.</v>

167
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.170
You try to break the system and see what works.

168
00:09:33.171 --> 00:09:35.030
You put up as much pressure as possible.

169
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:40.010
This is very much computer stuff that you should be able to appreciate the point

170
00:09:40.011 --> 00:09:41.270
being when you have a program,

171
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.570
you're trying to intentionally sit there and do as many mistakes,

172
00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.550
see what go wrong. Right. Is that not common?

173
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.160
<v 0>Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So you're saying that's,</v>

174
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.870
that's a way to see communication with the world, as you say,

175
00:09:53.871 --> 00:09:58.520
something uncontroversial and uncontroversial way and that blocks

176
00:09:58.521 --> 00:09:59.354
people.

177
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.300
<v 1>Or does it trigger them? Do they roll their eyes? Well, you know what,</v>

178
00:10:02.301 --> 00:10:05.150
it's going to be the emotional response. Are they gonna start yelling?

179
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:09.800
<v 0>The problem is that w the reason I can't think like this, or I can't,</v>

180
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:14.450
because I'm not sure about the points I'm trying to make. Uh,

181
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.600
always like I'm not always a hundred percent sure that I'm right about things

182
00:10:17.601 --> 00:10:20.000
like, so, um, in being thoughtful,

183
00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:25.510
I'm afraid that I'll turn off within an

184
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.820
eloquently phrased or even incorrect statement.

185
00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:34.370
I will do damage that can't be undone in terms of having a

186
00:10:34.371 --> 00:10:39.230
good conversation about a topic. So I want to be very careful about, like,

187
00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:43.340
I'm not saying afraid. Fear is not what I'm talking about.

188
00:10:43.341 --> 00:10:46.310
I think fear is, is, uh,

189
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:50.540
like not saying something out of fears at the core of the many of the problems

190
00:10:50.541 --> 00:10:54.830
of the world today, but I'm just saying, be, say stuff with care.

191
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.530
If I'm going to touch race as a topic,

192
00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:02.420
it feels like you really should be deeply first

193
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:06.230
have a point to make, like, you really care about a point you want to make.

194
00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:11.240
And second think deeply about how to say that point in a way that communicates

195
00:11:11.241 --> 00:11:14.480
it the best and, and touching,

196
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:19.580
I would say, listen, I've, I've, uh,

197
00:11:19.581 --> 00:11:23.480
on your show, which is, which is great. I mean, I'd like to say,

198
00:11:23.481 --> 00:11:26.900
thank you for having [inaudible] mobile. You are welcome.

199
00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:32.270
That's the, uh, that's the name of the show? Uh,

200
00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.250
so thank you for having me a couple of times. It's,

201
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:38.630
it's great to sort of get him to in this loose way to talk about different.

202
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:41.540
<v 1>I don't think we talked about race at all, so no,</v>

203
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.420
but I'm just bringing it back to what you were asking, which is,

204
00:11:44.421 --> 00:11:47.270
if you read the Wikipedia, the perspective is going to be,

205
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:49.220
this guy talks about slavery constantly,

206
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.950
where it's completely disproportionate to his work,

207
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.220
but even on your show can tell even not.

208
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.000
<v 0>Outside of the very stuff that he's not ultra careful about.</v>

209
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.860
He's not a nuanced. Yeah.

210
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:06.160
He's not afraid to say something just like, I would say,

211
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.600
let me just criticize him.

212
00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:12.370
My face is not used as me carelessly say something controversial, right?

213
00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:16.780
Like, um, I'm not saying he doesn't go like, you know, that makes them,

214
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.870
it's a very different thing than, uh, uh,

215
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.980
somebody who on purpose says something controversial stuff, uh,

216
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:28.300
like Milo Yiannopoulos, sorry. I forgot my Milo, whatever his name is.

217
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.500
Yeah. Which is really nice to see that he's a genuine person who thoughtful.

218
00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:33.720
He doesn't mean to,

219
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:37.840
but he's just Kara carelessly seems to say things

220
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:42.370
that, uh, I feel like damaged the rest of his body of work.

221
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:44.340
<v 1>Yeah. I can't really speak for him,</v>

222
00:12:44.341 --> 00:12:48.570
but I would guess his point is once you're swimming in this kind of

223
00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:52.800
worldview, you're going to be anathema already.

224
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.380
So there's no pleasing these people. So why bother trying?

225
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:57.660
<v 0>Yeah. I think that's a deeply, that's a,</v>

226
00:12:57.661 --> 00:13:00.840
that's a black pill way of seeing the world I blacked filled at all,

227
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:05.550
because it's a cynical way that these people, so like, it's, it's saying that

228
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:11.640
you're, it's a very kind of way of thinking. Like, I'll say whatever I want,

229
00:13:11.641 --> 00:13:13.020
whoever comes along with me.

230
00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:14.580
<v 1>Earlier said yourself,</v>

231
00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:18.990
that race racism has been weaponized as a way to shut down conversation.

232
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:21.360
So I think his perspective would be,

233
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:26.250
I am so outside the mainstream in my worldview that I know I'm going to be

234
00:13:26.251 --> 00:13:28.110
called racism racist.

235
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:32.520
So there's no point in trying to be nuanced because I'm already going to get the

236
00:13:32.521 --> 00:13:33.470
Scarlet letter. Yeah.

237
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.870
<v 0>I just disagree with that because for example, I'm one,</v>

238
00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:41.010
I am one person that he turned off okay. By his carelessness.

239
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:45.960
And I think I should be a good target. I should be somebody that's fair. And,

240
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.810
um, I'm just like, he,

241
00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.960
it's very convenient to think that there's ridiculous people out there,

242
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.260
which they are, who call everybody racist and sexist currently.

243
00:13:55.590 --> 00:14:00.030
And then you can't please them. So I'm not even going to try. No,

244
00:14:00.031 --> 00:14:03.750
but there's like this gray area of people that I don't listen to.

245
00:14:03.751 --> 00:14:05.700
The outrage culture, whatever. I don't,

246
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.430
this Wikipedia article means nothing to me. Like I,

247
00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:12.030
I'm not going to write what, I'm more,

248
00:14:12.031 --> 00:14:16.110
I'm just seeing this careless person. And if he's going to be careless about,

249
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:22.080
uh, like race like this, I feel like if I walk along with them long enough,

250
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.020
I'm going to catch the carelessness.

251
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.380
I'm going to lose like, Oh.

252
00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.480
<v 1>I'll defend your perspective there. Then you can, okay.</v>

253
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.850
<v 0>This is, this is good. I'm taking notes.</v>

254
00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.750
<v 1>I talked to Eric Weinstein after you guys talked about me on your Chanel's was</v>

255
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.970
that we had a good conversation. He invited.

256
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:41.460
<v 0>Me on his show. That'd be an amazing conversation. And.</v>

257
00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:45.450
<v 1>We got on the phone and his concern fairly. He goes,</v>

258
00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.120
I don't want you to come on my show for the purposes of clowning.

259
00:14:48.121 --> 00:14:53.080
Me and I would never do that. Yeah. It would never,

260
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.710
ever, ever, we might not be aware of who you are.

261
00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.830
That's why he wants to feel me out. He's like, you know, when he hears troll,

262
00:14:57.831 --> 00:14:59.480
it could mean a lot of different things. And I,

263
00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:01.340
we had a very conversation a very much,

264
00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.770
it was very clear that that's not where the conversation would go.

265
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.860
But I think when you are going to be on someone's show,

266
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:12.320
there is a responsibility that they're not going to have to pay a cost for

267
00:15:12.321 --> 00:15:14.090
having you as their guests. So if you're a pro,

268
00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.740
if you were put off by how he wasn't that live streams or two, I did like,

269
00:15:18.741 --> 00:15:21.710
I understand where you're coming from. I think he's very, very bright,

270
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:23.300
but you have a very,

271
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.460
you have a different audience than I do when you're going for something

272
00:15:25.461 --> 00:15:26.360
different than, than I am.

273
00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:31.360
<v 0>No, no, I, uh, in my interest, the sense of you wouldn't feel safe with him.</v>

274
00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.210
Yeah. I wouldn't feel safe with them, but he's, he's born in for me.

275
00:15:34.211 --> 00:15:37.810
I think I th I would like to actually talk to him one day. Uh,

276
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.600
Alex Jones is crossed the other line for me.

277
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.200
<v 1>Well, you could do it legally with me tip the episode that never released it.</v>

278
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:51.010
<v 0>No, it's, it's one of those things will be, uh, one when there's finally,</v>

279
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.570
they'll, they'll make a history channel documentary about you and I,

280
00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:56.920
and how it all went wrong.

281
00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:01.510
Like the cult that we started and everybody killed themselves. And, uh,

282
00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:03.870
there was, uh, uh,

283
00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.360
we'll release it then because there'll be like unseen footage.

284
00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.440
This is how it started is it would be black and white

285
00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:16.780
in a basement somewhere in New York. My mother's basement.

286
00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:20.500
Uh, this explains so much okay.
