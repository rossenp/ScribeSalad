00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.290
<v 0>You know, the African friends that I've come to be close with and really love.</v>

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.730
I mean, the, the humor there's so much there. I have common,

3
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.330
common stuff of like, when I go to Ireland, it's one of my favorite places.

4
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.810
And just like the, I feel a sense of pressure. Like the humor all around me,

5
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.570
the time I feel like there's something between iron,

6
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.280
like Ireland and Russia with the humor stuff where it's like, you've,

7
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.720
you gotta be on your game if you wanna be, you know? So it's yeah. It's not.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.280
<v 1>I feel like, know what I mean? The intensity of conversation &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.</v>

9
00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:35.680
In terms of, yeah. You have to be on your game in terms of wit and so on.

10
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.560
I mean, you have to, there's certain people I have like,

11
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.800
wanna talk on this podcast. They're like that, uh,

12
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.030
certain people from the Jewish tradition have that like where the whip is just

13
00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:49.990
like, okay, I have to, yeah. I really have to pay attention. It's a game.

14
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.470
It's like, it's, it's like a, you know, what, it feels like,

15
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:54.790
it feels like speed chess or something like that.

16
00:00:54.791 --> 00:00:57.430
And you really have to focus and play.

17
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.870
And at the same time there's body language and the,

18
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.030
and then there's the melancholy nature to at least in the Russian side. And the,

19
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.420
a whole thing is just a beautiful.

20
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.380
<v 0>Message. I mean, yeah. I mean, there's a,</v>

21
00:01:06.381 --> 00:01:07.860
there's a funny two talk video that went around that,

22
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.980
that I got from like some Afghan acquaintances that was, uh,

23
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.660
that he's an Irish comedian kind of highlighting, you know, kind Irish and,

24
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.300
and German national stereotypes around hospitality. And, um,

25
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.581
this Afghan moments that, you know,

26
00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:25.770
I didn't know that the Irish were just white Afghans because the whole, like,

27
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.130
you know, the hospitality, like politics of like, of refusal, you know, you,

28
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.851
you know, you don't,

29
00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:32.690
you don't take something that's offered to you the first time you don't,

30
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.170
you know, I mean, it's the, the culture of, um, of receiving a guest, you know,

31
00:01:37.171 --> 00:01:40.130
that's, you know, Americans aren't, I mean, that's not, you know,

32
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.730
that's not always, I mean,

33
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.410
they're different the regional cultures where that's the thing,

34
00:01:43.411 --> 00:01:44.490
there's whatever, but it's, I mean, the,

35
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.520
the kind of like generosity and the kind of, you know, that that's, that's real.

36
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.720
I mean, that's, and that's a cool thing and that's amazing. That's, um,

37
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.520
you know, the food, I mean, going on just the superficial things, but, but the,

38
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.720
but all that, the, the warmth of hospitality and, um,

39
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.280
of wit and humanity, I mean, it's, that, that,

40
00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:05.560
that's what we don't see view the,

41
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.070
the place just through war and geopolitics and the moving pieces of the map and

42
00:02:09.071 --> 00:02:09.231
stuff.

43
00:02:09.231 --> 00:02:12.710
<v 2>And that's, and that's hard to see when, you know, there are gaps in, in,</v>

44
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.310
in language and in religious tradition and, and all that stuff. And then,

45
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.950
you know, being open to the fact that people do do things differently, you know,

46
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.990
and it's, uh, and the gender mention they're important, right? That they're,

47
00:02:23.991 --> 00:02:25.950
they're kind of, you know,

48
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.300
arguably each culture has a kind of gen gender dynamic is different.

49
00:02:29.301 --> 00:02:33.380
And so I think it's helpful to have humility in thinking that some Afghans will

50
00:02:33.381 --> 00:02:35.660
do something, something different differently. You mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

51
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.780
but then you'll also have Afghans who say, everyone should be educated.

52
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.900
Everyone should work and so on and so on. So there's no,

53
00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:43.140
there's no single way of, yeah.

54
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.020
<v 1>Yeah. And there is a gen dynamic in Russia too. They,</v>

55
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.930
we need to be a respectful that like, uh.

56
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.010
<v 0>And that's not, that's not always what it looks like at first.</v>

57
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.250
<v 1>There's.</v>

58
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.930
<v 0>Layers where power is. I mean, that's definitely, I don't know. Yeah.</v>

59
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.570
<v 1>Uh, yeah, that's a whole nother conversation where the power is. Yeah.</v>
