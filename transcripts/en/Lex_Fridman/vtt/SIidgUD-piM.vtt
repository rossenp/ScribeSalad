00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.060
<v 0>So you mentioned building blocks. Uh, you didn't mention the word God,</v>

2
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.210
um, or sort of the afterlife are those essential to the myth.

3
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.890
So there's a contact experience.

4
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.630
Is there some other aspects of myth and religion which makes them

5
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.493
viral,

6
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.470
which makes them spread and captivate the imagination of people?

7
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.400
<v 1>Yes. Is there a pattern to them?</v>

8
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.450
I think that for each era it's different and people have first,

9
00:00:35.451 --> 00:00:37.790
let's talk about the definition of religion if that's okay.

10
00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:42.560
Because most people assume the definitions that we in the

11
00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:47.420
West are familiar with, which is that, you know, that of Christianity, Islam,

12
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.620
um, Judaism, you know, monotheistic religions. And there are,

13
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.250
that's not, I mean, those are just some religions.

14
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.140
There are so many different types of religions.

15
00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.400
Some religions have no God at all. Uh, Zen Buddhism for example,

16
00:01:01.401 --> 00:01:06.140
is a religion that asks you to take away your belief

17
00:01:06.141 --> 00:01:08.300
structures. Like to kind of like in fact,

18
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.750
I would call that a content type religion, right. And that it's,

19
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.250
it's basically telling you to get rid of your concept concepts of what you think

20
00:01:16.251 --> 00:01:20.150
about things so that you can actually have the experience like you were talking

21
00:01:20.151 --> 00:01:23.840
about earlier of the thing in itself. And they call that Satori.

22
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.040
So there are people who believe, you know, they try to,

23
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.340
they call it meditation, Zen meditation. Um,

24
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.480
and it's fairly radical actually. I'm in some monasteries,

25
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.400
I don't know if they still do this,

26
00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:42.260
but they'll whack you on the head if you appear to be, um,

27
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.510
not focusing and you know, that kind of thing, you know, they do things to,

28
00:01:46.511 --> 00:01:51.200
to basically take you away from your conceptions of reality

29
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.280
and bring you into a state of all that is,

30
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.030
which is what they call Satori. And that has nothing to do with God.

31
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.610
<v 0>I like this religion and anything that involves sticks and whacking in order for</v>

32
00:02:04.611 --> 00:02:08.650
you to focus better, I'm going to have to join a monastery. So, okay. So,

33
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.760
so w uh, digging into definitions, religion. So like, what is,

34
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.140
what do you think is the scope that defines a religion?

35
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.540
<v 1>Oh, okay. So in my field, we have a few different definitions of religion,</v>

36
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.321
as you can imagine,

37
00:02:24.321 --> 00:02:27.980
just like philosophers have different definitions of what is real. Um,

38
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:32.720
so I take this definition and it comes from John Livingston and it's, um,

39
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.740
religion is that set of beliefs and practices. Um,

40
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.490
that determine that is inspired by a transformative,

41
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.530
what is perceived actually to be a transformative and sacred power.

42
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.960
Can you say that again? Yeah. So religion is a set of, it's not just belief,

43
00:02:50.961 --> 00:02:51.890
it's also practices,

44
00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:55.130
it's both belief and practices because you won't have the practices without the

45
00:02:55.131 --> 00:02:57.530
belief. So you have those together. Okay.

46
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.820
And it's inspired by what is perceived,

47
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.320
because we don't know if it's real or not.

48
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.490
What is perceived to be of sacred and transforming power.

49
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.610
<v 0>So perceived by the followers,</v>

50
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.130
or is this connected to the original sort of experience?

51
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.830
<v 1>No, no. Well, it's, it's perceived by the followers.</v>

52
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.870
<v 0>That's a really good definition. So,</v>

53
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.960
and that's the governing idea is that there's something of great power

54
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.780
perceived to be of great power to which you can connect yourself

55
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.340
either emotionally or intellectually somehow in order to explore the world that

56
00:03:32.341 --> 00:03:34.860
is beyond your own capabilities. Yes.

57
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.570
And is there communication also involved or, yeah. Yeah.

58
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.620
That's a great definition. Okay. So within that falls,

59
00:03:43.621 --> 00:03:48.030
everything that we've talked about so far, including technology and,

60
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.090
um, alien life and so on.
