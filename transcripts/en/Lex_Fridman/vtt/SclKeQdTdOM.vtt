00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.920
<v 0>Can I ask you about jujitsu.</v>

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.073
<v 1>By all means.</v>

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.420
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt;. What have you learned from being a practitioner you're a black belt.</v>

4
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.300
What have you learned from this journey? Uh, of,

5
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.820
um, being a martial artist.

6
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.450
<v 1>Jujitsu for me was the connect of tissue that</v>

7
00:00:25.451 --> 00:00:30.450
started to join my mind together with all the different aspects of my

8
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:34.730
life. And so jujitsu for me was, was really important.

9
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.690
And I don't think I would be doing anything that I'm doing right now if it

10
00:00:37.691 --> 00:00:39.050
wasn't for jujitsu. Wow.

11
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.850
So there's various aspects of my life that were in

12
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:44.740
existence,

13
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.800
but I didn't understand how they were connected until I started training

14
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:48.663
jujitsu.

15
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.480
The primary things are interacting with other human beings and

16
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.520
combat tactics and strategy and jujitsu and all those things are

17
00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:00.190
connected.

18
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.750
They all follow the same guiding principles and I wouldn't have recognized those

19
00:01:04.751 --> 00:01:07.270
guiding principles if I didn't do jujitsu.

20
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.430
<v 0>Can you elaborate? Cause you've trained for many, many years. What, um,</v>

21
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.950
is it the hardship? Is it the humbling nature of just being tapped all over,

22
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.830
you know, nonstop or I actually dunno how many times &lt;laugh&gt;.

23
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.780
<v 1>I've tapped more times than you. Okay. Okay. So.</v>

24
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.300
<v 0>Good. Is it just the hardship of physical training?</v>

25
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.940
Like the honesty of the mat in the sense that like, you know,

26
00:01:32.941 --> 00:01:36.780
what works and what doesn't work, which, which aspects were the most, uh,

27
00:01:36.781 --> 00:01:37.820
impactful for you?

28
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.060
<v 1>All, all aspects. So, yes, from a humility perspective,</v>

29
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.980
when you realize you think, when you think, you know what you're doing,

30
00:01:44.981 --> 00:01:45.510
when you,

31
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.130
you have certain skills and you realize that there's always somebody better than

32
00:01:49.131 --> 00:01:50.210
you, and you realize that, Hey,

33
00:01:50.211 --> 00:01:53.890
maybe I don't have all the answers all the time and you bring that to a

34
00:01:53.891 --> 00:01:57.610
leadership perspective and you walk into your platoon and you realize that maybe

35
00:01:57.611 --> 00:01:59.970
you don't have all the answers all the time and maybe you should listen to what

36
00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:00.810
other people have to say.

37
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.160
You bring that to a combat situation and you realize that you think if you sit

38
00:02:06.161 --> 00:02:10.000
there and think that you're smarter than the enemy, you're gonna be complacent,

39
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:13.880
you're gonna make mistakes. So there's one aspect outta the gate,

40
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.000
as far as you know, if I,

41
00:02:19.001 --> 00:02:22.640
if I'm going to try and get your arm, do I attack your arm?

42
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.240
<v 0>Maybe not directly, unless I'm a white belt.</v>

43
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.750
<v 1>Exactly. What do I do? I attack your neck.</v>

44
00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:33.550
And when you reach up to defend your neck, that's when I get your arm. Well,

45
00:02:33.551 --> 00:02:36.470
if I'm out on the battlefield and there's an enemy position,

46
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.790
should I attack frontal assault into that position? No,

47
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:42.723
no, I shouldn't.

48
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.670
I should put down some covering fire and I should maneuver around to the flank.

49
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.613
It's the same thing.

50
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.980
If I'm dealing with you and you're my boss and you've got a giant ego and you've

51
00:02:51.981 --> 00:02:54.540
come up with a plan and I don't like your plan, should I walk up to you and say,

52
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.740
Hey Lex, your plan, isn't good. No. Or should I say, Hey,

53
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.440
L can I ask you some questions about how you want us to execute this?

54
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.400
Cuz I wanna make sure I understand your vision.

55
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.673
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

56
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.320
<v 1>So all these things are connected. Yes.</v>

57
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.760
And I wouldn't have realized that we could sit here and do this forever.

58
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.560
We could, we could, I could tell you these comparisons forever. Yeah.

59
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.350
But this, all this connective tissue bringing all these things together.

60
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.590
I wouldn't have seen it without ju I don't think I would've seen it without

61
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.510
jujitsu. So jujitsu to me had a,

62
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.790
had a incredible life impact on me.

63
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.750
Not look the physical part. Yes, absolutely. Does it,

64
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.900
does it keep you humble when you know that there's

65
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.940
145 pound individual that can tap you out when you're 220 pound,

66
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.500
25 year old guy,

67
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.740
and there's 135 or 140 pound, you know,

68
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.380
46 year old guy that can make you tap out. That's humbling.

69
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.770
And what do you do with that?

70
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.090
Do you run away from it or do you continue to pursue it? Same thing with life,

71
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.970
same thing with anything. So jujitsu is an incredibly powerful,

72
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.050
not just physical aspect, but it's, it's a way to understand.

73
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.290
It's a way of thinking.

74
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.970
<v 0>You've also competed. Is there something you can speak to the,</v>

75
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.160
a value of competition?

76
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.120
Obviously you've been through combat actual military

77
00:04:26.121 --> 00:04:30.040
combat is many, many, many orders of magnitude,

78
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.440
more high stakes than competition in a,

79
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.480
in a silly sport like jujitsu. Nevertheless,

80
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.870
it's still has some of the echos of the same challenges.

81
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.270
Is there something you can speak to the value of competition for you?

82
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.500
<v 1>Yep.</v>

83
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.470
Competition will reveal weaknesses in your game that you can then go back and

84
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.550
train to rectify.

85
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.990
<v 0>So that that's very useful to sort of, uh, yeah. As a testing ground, of course,</v>

86
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.460
training can be that sing ground as well, uh, or, or, um, that.

87
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.860
<v 1>Feedback. Yep.</v>

88
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.940
But as you and I both know if you and I train together all the time,

89
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.300
you'll know my game, I'll know your game. And even if we have five other people,

90
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.380
we all kind of understand each other's games. Yes.

91
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.780
And you're not doing something to me that I don't expect.

92
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.140
So when I go and compete, I'm, you're, you know, this random person is,

93
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.850
has game that I've never seen before.

94
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.810
I'm and I may or may not know how to deal with that game.

95
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.890
If I know how to deal with it. Great. I get the victory.

96
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.250
Maybe I don't learn as much if I don't know how to deal with their game.

97
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:37.050
I get the loss and I get the win of learning.

98
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.610
What some weakness in my game is.
