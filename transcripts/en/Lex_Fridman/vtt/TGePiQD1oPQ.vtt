1
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.900
<v 0>Were you surprised that he lost to da in the trials to Kyle</v>

2
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.013
da?

3
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.460
<v 1>Oh, Kyle's so, so he's so good. Right? I mean, I think,</v>

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.100
I think his performance to the Olympics was, uh, was his loss was,

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.260
was shocking to, I mean, we noticed it happened to Kyle da. You know,

6
00:00:20.261 --> 00:00:23.690
he's been a guy who's compet with Jordan burrows forever.

7
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.330
And obviously he was on the losing side for a while and now he's on the winning

8
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.890
side. Um, but I think a lot of people thought it was a coin flip.

9
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.170
And I think actually Kyle Digg made it feel like it's not a coin flip it feel

10
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.290
now to me it feels like Kyle D is gonna win that match significantly more times

11
00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:41.170
than he isn't is what it feels like.

12
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.040
<v 0>Yeah. I forgot which trials it was.</v>

13
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.960
Was it four years ago where Kyle, Dick threw him?

14
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.320
Like he, he, so you saw inklings of like, yeah. Oh, wow.

15
00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:56.640
There might be a eventually a changing of.

16
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.920
<v 1>The guard. Yeah. So 13 Kyle came out and he had the one throw,</v>

17
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.150
but then he lost one of the matches, decisive Lee. Um,

18
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.150
and then he was hurting 14 and in 16,

19
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.870
Kyle Dick actually went up to 86 kilograms. So in,

20
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.750
in actually in 16 at the trials we had, um, so Jake Herber was number one seed.

21
00:01:16.751 --> 00:01:20.830
He was former as guy Russell. I was a former world silver medalist. So you had,

22
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.870
uh, David Taylor who had not made a team yet,

23
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.780
who was now a world champion Olympic in,

24
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.900
you had Kyle Dick in the bracket who was a two time world champion now.

25
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.780
And you had Jane Cox in the bracket who had not made any teams yet.

26
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.220
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but is now what? A four time world medals,

27
00:01:34.221 --> 00:01:37.700
two time world champion. So, and then obviously Jane came out on top of that,

28
00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:40.300
won his first Olympic medal Olympic bronze medal. Um,

29
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.380
so Kyle didn't wrestle Jordan in 16 and,

30
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.570
and Jordan Kyle's contention the whole time and they argued about this.

31
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.010
So I actually did a little bit of backstabbing. Well, it not,

32
00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:53.850
it's not backing and both of them or just one of them,

33
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.890
I didn't tell any of them. Okay. Okay. So Jordan got mad. So we talk,

34
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.650
we talked about this fake match, drink Corona, right? We, yeah. We had to make,

35
00:01:59.651 --> 00:02:00.850
we had to make up something to talk about. Yeah.

36
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.890
So there's obviously no matches. So we talk about this fake match. And do.

37
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.760
<v 0>You stand behind a.</v>

38
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.520
<v 1>Statement by the way? Listen, here's what, here's what I said.</v>

39
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.600
Kyle Kyle takes four time state champion. Yes. I said, you gotta pick a,

40
00:02:11.601 --> 00:02:13.960
you gotta pick a winner. I said, Kyle, Dick wins two,

41
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.360
one on a minute and six ride time. Which I mean is literally we're talking.

42
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.080
Yeah. As close as it gets as close as it gets for Kyle Dick.

43
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.080
Who's a four time ch champion. Oh, sorry.

44
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.080
<v 0>Sorry.</v>

45
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.990
Were we talking over Jordan burs over borrows and a folks now match and a folks

46
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.590
dont match hypothetical college or now complet hypothetical.

47
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.670
<v 1>Now or in college? In college. In both of 'em at their peaks at 1 65 pounds.</v>

48
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.470
Right. So completely hypothetical. And so Jordan called in,

49
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.110
he was all at me for picking Kyle Dick. Yeah.

50
00:02:42.111 --> 00:02:44.470
He wants to come on the next day and argue his point. Yeah.

51
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.020
So I said F that that's the that's dumb. We had to pick a winner.

52
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.100
We had to do something hypothetical. So then I called Kyle Day. I said, Kyle,

53
00:02:51.101 --> 00:02:54.260
Jordan's gonna come on and argue his case in the morning. If he's gonna do that,

54
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.940
why don't you come in and argue your case?

55
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.360
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so no one else knew Kyle was coming on the podcast.

56
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.560
So they both show up and they went at it.

57
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.200
But one of the contentions Kyle had for years, and there's still this rule.

58
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.280
If you win a world level medal, the following year,

59
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.680
you sit out until the very end of the American trials and they do,

60
00:03:15.681 --> 00:03:16.880
they do a best two or three.

61
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.910
So every time previous say that Kyle had wrestled Jordan,

62
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.430
he had to come through a tournament on Saturday. Yeah. Okay.

63
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:24.583
Probably three matches.

64
00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.390
And then on Sunday he would wrestle Jordan in the best two out of three. Right?

65
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.470
So his contention was, I'm only wrestling Jordan at a disadvantage.

66
00:03:31.471 --> 00:03:34.630
Cause I have to compete on Saturday and then competing on which it it's a fair

67
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.670
argument. It really is. But I also see USA wrestling's point it's like,

68
00:03:38.671 --> 00:03:41.260
if someone wins world medal we're we are gonna reward them.

69
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.620
Cause we want that person on the team again. So.

70
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.060
<v 0>It's crazy though, that you're like, Kyle Dick had to wrestle.</v>

71
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.020
Cause he's not wrestling bums in that. Yeah. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and, and yeah,

72
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.100
I don't know. I don't know how wrestlers do it because yeah.

73
00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.250
You have to go to war like three matches and then phase Jordan burs.

74
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.810
<v 1>Yeah. Especially a few of those years with, you know, day the name Andrew, how,</v>

75
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.730
but those were really competitive matches.

76
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.850
David Taylor had really competitive match with him.

77
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.650
Isaiah Martinez even got in there dearer.

78
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.050
So he had some really competitive matches before he ever got to, uh,

79
00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:17.970
Jordan burs. So I never answered your initial question was, uh, how did I feel?

80
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.640
So the Jordan burs match, I was not in wrestling shape at all.

81
00:04:22.641 --> 00:04:24.880
Meaning wrestling's heavily depend, especially in neutral positions,

82
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:27.960
heavily dependent on timing and other things. I was wrestling very,

83
00:04:27.961 --> 00:04:30.360
very minimally. Cause I was, I started fighting again.

84
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.960
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so like my, my shape athletic shape was great,

85
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.200
but it was mainly for fighting. I wasn't wrestling. So, um,

86
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.310
I think they were actually trying to do burrows at beat the streets.

87
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.253
It's the big,

88
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.550
it's the biggest fundraiser in wrestling every single year in New York.

89
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.270
In New York city. Yeah. They usually raise like a million dollars.

90
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.950
They started all these programs in New York city to get,

91
00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:52.910
which I really wonder what they're doing with the money now.

92
00:04:52.911 --> 00:04:55.110
Cause they probably can't have the kids wrestling because new York's crazy.

93
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:56.830
Anyways, I think.

94
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.670
<v 0>New York figures out a way what to do with the money.</v>

95
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.660
Hence Michael mal complaining that to corrupt.

96
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.140
<v 1>And all that. Well, no it go. But it goes to the beat, the streets organization.</v>

97
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.860
Oh it does. Who then starts the clubs in New York.

98
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:09.940
So I don't know what through mind. Anyway, so I was called like, I don't know,

99
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.380
two, two weeks before the event and said, Hey,

100
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.700
you know someone to wrestle Jordan burrows, it fell out. Would you wrestle?

101
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.850
'em? I said, yeah, sure. Why not? &lt;laugh&gt; you know? And it's like, well, listen,

102
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.410
I, I,

103
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.930
I trained with them for four days the year before I had a pretty good idea how

104
00:05:26.931 --> 00:05:30.330
the match was gonna go. Wasn't gonna go so well for me. But it's like, okay,

105
00:05:30.331 --> 00:05:31.290
you're missing a main event.

106
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.650
I can bring a because of where I'm at right now in my life.

107
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.410
I can bring a lot of attention to wrestling.

108
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.770
I can help you guys raise a bunch of money, beat the streets. My,

109
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.760
my goal is I think I thought I could get one take down or turn on him was kind

110
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.600
of my goal for the match. I didn't get there. Uh, you weren't kind of hard.

111
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.320
He went hard. Yeah. That can gimme a point. Yeah. That &lt;laugh&gt; I said, this is,

112
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.160
Jordan. I told him you're in the match. Like this is.

113
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.440
You're going too hard right now. Yeah. I'm not a wrestler.

114
00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.440
I'm not a wrestler anymore. I'm a fighter I'm coming in here. So yeah. So I,

115
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.320
I had a really good idea. I mean, we, we wrestle together. I think in,

116
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.760
in he'll probably get mad. Cause I think in the live go, we did like the 12,

117
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.120
15 minutes. I think I actually scored a take down in that. Yeah.

118
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.120
I believe maybe. Or maybe it was a turn he'll probably say no I didn't,

119
00:06:12.121 --> 00:06:16.160
but whatever. Um, yeah, so I, I, I knew what was gonna happen. I,

120
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.910
I knew what the outcome was gonna be.

121
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.790
I knew I could pro I hope I could stay competitive and maybe, you know,

122
00:06:20.791 --> 00:06:23.430
lose like ten two or something like, yeah.
