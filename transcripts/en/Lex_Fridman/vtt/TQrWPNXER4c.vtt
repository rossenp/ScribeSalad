00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.960
<v 0>Is there a meaning to this thing? Is there a meaning to life? What is the.</v>

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.600
<v 1>Meaning of life? I was brought up by a physicist, uh, and a physician.</v>

3
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.480
They were more or less committed atheists who had left the church of Scotland

4
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.480
as a protest against sectarianism in Glasgow.

5
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.070
And so my sister and I were taught old from an early age life was a cosmic

6
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.990
accident. Uh, and that was it.

7
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.110
There was no great meaning to it. Uh,

8
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.710
and I, I can't really get past that. Isn't.

9
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.230
<v 0>There a beauty to being an accident at a cosmic scale?</v>

10
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.220
<v 1>Yes. I wasn taught to, to feel negative about that. And if anything,</v>

11
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.820
it was a frivolous,

12
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.180
a frivolous insight that the whole thing was a kind of joke. Um,

13
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.820
and,

14
00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.140
and I think that atheism isn't really a basis for ordering a society,

15
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.530
but it's, it's been all right me.

16
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.570
I don't have a kind of sense of,

17
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.690
of a missing religious faith for me.

18
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.640
However,

19
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.050
there's clearly some embedded Christian ethics

20
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.010
in the way my parents lived.

21
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.160
And so we were kind of atheist Calvinists who

22
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.040
had kind of deposed God,

23
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.640
but carried on behaving as if we were members of the elect in,

24
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.080
in a moral universe. So that's kind of, um,

25
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.200
the state of mind that &lt;laugh&gt;, that I was left in. And I,

26
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.753
I think that

27
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.710
we aren't really around long enough to claim that our

28
00:01:48.711 --> 00:01:50.150
individual lives have meaning,

29
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.110
but what Edman Burke said is true,

30
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.910
the real social contract is between the generations between the dead,

31
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.830
the living and the unborn and the meaning of life is for me, at least,

32
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.700
uh, to live in a way that honor the dead seeks to learn from their accumulated

33
00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:11.500
wisdom, cuz they do still outnumber us. They outnumber the,

34
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.060
the living by quite a significant margin and then to be mindful of the unborn

35
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.460
and our, our responsibility to them.

36
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.180
Writing books is a way of communicating with the unborn.

37
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.170
It may or may not succeed and probably won't succeed.

38
00:02:29.171 --> 00:02:32.170
If my books are never assigned by work professors in the future.

39
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.490
So what we have to do is more than just write books and record podcasts.

40
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.810
They there have to be institutions I'm 57.

41
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.130
Now I realized recently that succession planning had to be

42
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.720
the main focus of the next 20 years because there are things that

43
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.800
I really care about that I want future generations to have access

44
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.400
to. And so the meaning of life,

45
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.280
I do regard as being intergenerational transfer of wisdom,

46
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.760
ultimately the species will go extinct at some point,

47
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.760
even if we do colonize Mars,

48
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.040
one senses that physics will catch up with this particular organism,

49
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.200
but it's in the pretty far distant future.

50
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.230
And so the meaning of life is to make sure that for as long as there are human

51
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.163
beings,

52
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.390
they are able to live the kind of fulfilled lives

53
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.230
ethically fulfilled, intellectually fulfilled,

54
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.710
emotionally fulfilled lives that civilization has made possible.

55
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.260
It would be easy for us to revert to the uncivilized world.

56
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.780
There's a fantastic book that, uh,

57
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.180
that I'm going to misremember me losses, the captive soul,

58
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.060
the captive mind rather, um, which has a fantastic passage.

59
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.740
Uh, he was a,

60
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.690
a Polish intellectual who says Americans can never

61
00:04:02.691 --> 00:04:07.490
imagine what it's like for civilization to be completely destroyed

62
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.810
as it was in Poland. At the end of, by the end of world war II,

63
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.530
to have no rule of law,

64
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.410
to have no security of even person nevermind property rights,

65
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.570
they can't imagine what that's like and what it will lead you to do.

66
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.960
&lt;affirmative&gt;. So one reason for teaching history is to remind the lucky,

67
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.400
uh, generation Z members of California, that,

68
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.120
that civilization's a thin film and it can be destroyed remarkably easily.

69
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.070
And to preserve civilization is a tremendous response that we have.

70
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.350
It's a huge responsibility and we must, we must not destroy ourselves,

71
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.910
whether it's in the name of,

72
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.430
of wo or the pursuit of the metaverse preserving civilization

73
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.390
and making it available, not just to our kids,

74
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.390
but to people will never know generations ahead. That's the meaning

75
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.860
and, and do so by studying the lessons of history, right?

76
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.500
Not only studying them, but then acting on them for me,

77
00:05:09.501 --> 00:05:13.140
the biggest problem is how do we apply history more effectively?

78
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.380
It seems as if our institutions, including government are very,

79
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.700
very bad at applying history, lessons of history are learn poorly.

80
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.330
If at tall analogies are drawn crudely, often the wrong inferences are drawn.

81
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.370
One of the big intellectual challenges for me is how to make history more

82
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.330
useful. And this was the kind of thing that professors used to hate,

83
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.010
but really practically useful.

84
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.090
So that policy makers and citizens can think about the decisions that they

85
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.640
face with a more historically informed body of knowledge,

86
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.040
whether it's a pandemic, the challenge of climate change,

87
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.160
what to do about Taiwan. I can't think of a better set of,

88
00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.280
uh, of things to know before you make decisions about those things. Then the,

89
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.560
the things that history has to.

90
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.920
<v 0>Offer. Well, I love the discipline of applied history,</v>

91
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:05.720
basically going to history and saying,

92
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.840
what are the key principles here that are

93
00:06:10.841 --> 00:06:13.920
applicable to the problems of today, right? And how can we solve.

94
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.110
<v 1>On that? The great philosopher of history, RJ calling said in his autobiography,</v>

95
00:06:19.111 --> 00:06:20.910
which was published in 1939,

96
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.950
that the purpose of history was to restitute past

97
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:30.950
thought from whatever surviving remnants there were and then

98
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:34.470
to juxtapose it with our own predicament.

99
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:38.660
And that's that juxtaposition of past experience with present experience that is

100
00:06:38.661 --> 00:06:42.940
so important. We don't do that well. Uh, and indeed we've,

101
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.100
we've flipped it so that academic historians now think their mission is to

102
00:06:47.101 --> 00:06:51.820
travel back to the past with the value system of 2021 and

103
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.060
castigate, uh, the,

104
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.210
the dead for their racism and sexism and transphobia and whatnot.

105
00:06:58.770 --> 00:06:59.970
And that's exactly wrong.

106
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.770
Our mission is to go back and try to understand what it was like to live in the

107
00:07:03.771 --> 00:07:08.770
18th century, not to go back and condescend the, the, the people of the past.

108
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.650
And once we've had a better understanding, once we've seen into their lives,

109
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.593
read their words,

110
00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.970
try to restitute their experience to come back and understand our own.

111
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.120
I'm better. That's what we should really be doing.

112
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.560
But academic history's gone completely haywired.

113
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.120
And it does almost the exact opposite of what I think it should.

114
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.880
<v 0>Do. And by studying history,</v>

115
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.560
walk beautifully gracefully through this simulation,

116
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.680
as you described by mapping the lessons of history into the world of today.

117
00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.870
<v 1>We have virtual reality already in our head. We do not need Oculus.</v>

118
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:45.870
<v 0>In the metaverse. This was an incredible hopeful conversation in,</v>

119
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.910
in many ways that did not expect.

120
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.990
I thought our conversation would be much more about history than about the

121
00:07:50.991 --> 00:07:53.030
future. And it turned out to be the opposite.

122
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.470
Thank you so much for talking today. It's a huge honor to finally meet you,

123
00:07:56.471 --> 00:07:58.470
to talk to you. Thank you for your valuable time.

124
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.860
<v 1>Thank you, L and good luck with Putin.</v>
