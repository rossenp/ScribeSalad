00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.420
<v 0>Uh, so again, from an evolutionary computation perspective,</v>

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.980
we we'll look at all the agents that, uh,

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.940
had to die in order to come up with different solutions in simulation. Uh,

4
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.460
what do you think from that individual agent's perspective is the meaning of it

5
00:00:18.461 --> 00:00:22.100
all so far as humans, you're just one agent who's going to be dead,

6
00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:24.690
unfortunately, one day too soon.

7
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.090
What do you think is the why of why that agent came

8
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.730
to be and, uh, eventually will be no more?

9
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.090
Is there meaning to it all?

10
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.270
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.850
In evolution there is meaning everything is a potential direction.

12
00:00:42.851 --> 00:00:45.880
Everything is a potential stepping stone. Um,

13
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.120
not all of them are gonna work out. Some of them are foundations for further,

14
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.600
um, improvement,

15
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.440
and even those that are perhaps going to die out, uh,

16
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.240
where potential images, potential solutions in biology.

17
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.310
We see a lot, the species die of naturally and, you know, like the dinosaurs,

18
00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:08.830
I mean, they have a really good solution for a while,

19
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.110
but then it didn't turned out to be not such a good solution in the long term.

20
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.870
Um, when there's an environmental change, you have to have diversity.

21
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.270
Some other solutions become better. Doesn't mean that, that, that,

22
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.990
that was an attempt. It didn't quite work out or last,

23
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.860
but there are still dinosaurs and mountains, at least their relatives.

24
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.100
And they may one day again, be useful, who knows?

25
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.420
So from an individual's perspective,

26
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.540
you gotta think of a bigger picture that it is a huge engine

27
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.980
that is innovative and these elements are all part of it,

28
00:01:43.981 --> 00:01:47.730
potentially innovation, uh, on their own. And also as, um,

29
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.490
as raw material perhaps, or, um,

30
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.410
stepping stones for other things that could come after.

31
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.530
<v 0>But it still feels from an individual perspective that I, I matter a lot,</v>

32
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.570
but even if I'm just a little co in a giant machine,

33
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.600
is that just a silly human notion you in, uh, individualistic society though?

34
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.160
She'll let go of that. Uh, do,

35
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.880
do you find beauty in being part of the giant machine?

36
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.240
<v 1>Yeah, I think it's meaningful. Um,</v>

37
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.480
I think it adds purpose to your life that you are part of something bigger.

38
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.160
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; that said, are you, uh,</v>

39
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.110
do ponder your individual agents mortality? Uh, do you,

40
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.950
do you think about death? Do you fear death?

41
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.391
<v 1>Well,</v>

42
00:02:34.391 --> 00:02:39.310
certainly more now than when I was a &lt;laugh&gt; youngster and did skydiving and

43
00:02:39.311 --> 00:02:42.310
paragliding and &lt;laugh&gt;, you know, all these things, uh.

44
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.950
<v 0>You become wiser.</v>

45
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.380
<v 1>Um, is a reason</v>

46
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.620
for this life arc that younger folks are more fearless

47
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.940
in many ways. It's part of the exploration mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know,

48
00:02:56.941 --> 00:03:00.000
they are the, they are the individuals who think, Hmm,

49
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.360
I wonder what's over those mountains. Or what if I go really far in that ocean?

50
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.200
What would I find? I mean, older folks don't necessarily think that way,

51
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.400
but young do, and it's kind of counterintuitive, so yeah, it's this, uh,

52
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.480
but logically it's like, you know, you have limited amount of time.

53
00:03:17.481 --> 00:03:20.550
What can you do with it? It matters. So you try to,

54
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.750
you have done your exploration, you committed to certain direction, uh,

55
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:30.230
and you become an expert perhaps in it. What can I do that matters, uh, with,

56
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.190
with the limited resources that I have? That's what, how you,

57
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.950
I think a lot of people, myself included start thinking later on in the career.

58
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.660
<v 0>And, uh, like you said,</v>

59
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.380
leave a bit of a trace and a bit of an impact even though after the agent is

60
00:03:45.381 --> 00:03:46.740
gone. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt;.

61
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.573
<v 1>That's the goal.</v>

62
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.980
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; well, this was a fascinating conversation.</v>

63
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.020
I don't think there's a better way to end it. Um, thank you so much.

64
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.193
So first of all,

65
00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.290
I'm very inspired of how vibrant the community at UT Austin and Austin is.

66
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.970
It's really exciting for me, uh, to see it.

67
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.410
And this whole field seems like profound philosophically,

68
00:04:07.411 --> 00:04:10.690
but also the path forward for the artificial intelligence community.

69
00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.770
So thank you so much for explaining so many cool things to me today and for

70
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:18.210
wasting all of your valuable time with me. Oh, it was a pleasure. Thanks, Larry.

71
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:18.770
I appreciate it.
