1
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:03.691
<v 0>You, uh,</v>

2
00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:07.180
you're the co-founder of just like we've been talking about axial systems. Uh,

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.320
would you say space propulsion company? Yes. Broadly speaking. Um,

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.180
so, uh, how do you, big question, how do you, uh,

5
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.980
build a rocket company from like a

6
00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:27.840
propulsion company from one person from two people to 10

7
00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:32.250
people plus, and actually, you know,

8
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.190
take it to a successful product?

9
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.270
<v 1>Yeah, well, I think the early stage is quite, uh,</v>

10
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.810
I'm not supposed to use the word easy when you work in rocket science,

11
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.410
but straightforward. Um, when you're working on something, you know,

12
00:00:48.411 --> 00:00:50.240
sexy like an ion engine,

13
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.640
it's more straightforward to raise money and get people to come work for

14
00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:57.320
you because the vision is really exciting.

15
00:00:57.321 --> 00:01:01.640
And actually that's something I would say is very important throughout is,

16
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.930
um,

17
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.730
a really exciting vision because when everything goes to crap,

18
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.410
um, you need that to get people getting themselves out of bed in the morning and

19
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.360
thinking of the, the higher purpose there. Um, and you know,

20
00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:22.010
another thing along the way that I think is key and in building any

21
00:01:22.011 --> 00:01:23.660
company is, um,

22
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.150
the right early employees that also have their own networks and

23
00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:33.710
can bring in, um, a lot of people that, um,

24
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.960
you know, really make the, this the whole greater than,

25
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.910
than just the, some of the early team.

26
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.140
<v 0>And how do you build that? Like how do you find people it's like asking,</v>

27
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.060
like how do you make friends, but is there, um, is it a,

28
00:01:50.061 --> 00:01:53.540
is it luck? Is there a system like how,

29
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.340
in terms of the people you've connected with the, the people, um,

30
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.350
you built the company with,

31
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.980
is there some thread, some commonality, some pattern, the,

32
00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:10.580
find it to be, to hold for what makes a great team?

33
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.170
<v 1>Uh, I think, you know, personally, uh,</v>

34
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.370
a thread for me has been my network and

35
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.850
being able to draw on that a lot,

36
00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:27.530
but also giving back to it as much as possible and like an

37
00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:32.030
unsolicited sort of way, like making connections between people that,

38
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.920
you know, maybe didn't ask, but that, um, I think could be really fruitful and,

39
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.630
um, even weirder than that is just really

40
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.960
getting, you know, having weird,

41
00:02:44.961 --> 00:02:49.550
uncomfortable conversations with people like at a conference and getting

42
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.710
over the small talk quickly and getting to know them quickly and having a

43
00:02:54.711 --> 00:02:59.000
relationship that stands out and then being able to call on them later because

44
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.270
that, um, and I think that's, it's,

45
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.860
that's been because I'm introverted and I, you know,

46
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:08.860
want to poke my eyes out instead of go and do small talk.

47
00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:12.400
And so I huddle in a corner with one person and, you know,

48
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:16.210
we talk about aliens or things like that. And, um, so, you know,

49
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:18.250
that's all to say that, you know,

50
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:22.570
having a strong network I think is really important, but a genuine one.

51
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.970
And let's see other ways to build a rocket company kind of making sure you're

52
00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:30.820
paying attention to this sweeping trends of the industry.

53
00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:34.390
So everybody just cares about cost and, um,

54
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.520
being able to get out ahead of that.

55
00:03:36.521 --> 00:03:39.160
And even more than we ever thought we need to,

56
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:42.160
as far as what we needed to price our systems that, you know,

57
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.980
people for since the start of the

58
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.260
U S space industry, they've been paying 20,

59
00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:53.170
25 million in adjusted dollars for an eye on in gen.

60
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.150
And seeing that now people are going to want to pay

61
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.390
10 K for an ion engine, um,

62
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.280
and just staying out ahead of that and those kinds of things. Um, so, you know,

63
00:04:06.281 --> 00:04:09.490
being out in the industry and talking to as many people.

64
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.340
<v 0>So there's a drive. I mean, I suppose space X really pushed that for me.</v>

65
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.740
So a space X really pushed this, uh, yeah,

66
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.420
the application of, uh, I guess, capitalism of driving the price down of, um,

67
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.630
basically forcing people to ask the question, can this,

68
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.520
can this be done cheaper? Um, th this can lead to

69
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.470
like big problems, I would say in the following sense,

70
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.330
I see this in the car industry, for example, that, uh,

71
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.820
people have S it's such a small margin for

72
00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:48.654
profit.

73
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.100
Like they've driven the cost of everything down so much that there's literally

74
00:04:53.101 --> 00:04:57.690
no room for innovation for taking risks. So like cars,

75
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.250
which is funny because not until Tesla really,

76
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.520
which is one of the, in a long, long time,

77
00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:08.880
one of the first successful new car companies,

78
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.860
that's constantly innovating.

79
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.690
Every other car company is really pouring in terms of their technological

80
00:05:15.691 --> 00:05:20.250
innovation. They innovate on design and style. And so on that you,

81
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.380
that people fall in love with the look and so on,

82
00:05:22.381 --> 00:05:26.040
but it's not really innovation, the insurance of the technology,

83
00:05:26.041 --> 00:05:29.970
and it's really boringly the same thing and they have really afraid of taking

84
00:05:29.971 --> 00:05:34.110
risks. And that's a big problem for RocketSpace too, is like,

85
00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.120
if you're cutting on costs, you can't afford to innovate to try out new things.

86
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.070
And that's definitely true with ion engine. Right. Uh,

87
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.690
so, but what, um, so how do you compete in this, uh,

88
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.490
in this space, do you, by the way, see space X as a competitor, uh,

89
00:05:53.491 --> 00:05:56.520
and what do you say in general about the competition in this space?

90
00:05:56.521 --> 00:06:00.380
Is it really difficult as a, as a business to compete here?

91
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.450
<v 1>No, I, I don't see space X as a competitor. Um,</v>

92
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.830
and I see them as one day, not too long from now a customer,

93
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.450
hopefully. Um, I mean, to compete against that,

94
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.130
I think you just have to do things in an unconventional way.

95
00:06:18.131 --> 00:06:23.020
So bringing Silicon memes, manufacturing to propulsion,

96
00:06:23.021 --> 00:06:23.740
you know,

97
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.330
NASA doesn't make ion engines using a batch

98
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.730
mass producible technique. They have, you know,

99
00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.330
one guy that's been making their eye on engines for 20 years,

100
00:06:34.331 --> 00:06:38.320
like bespoke pieces of jewelry. So, um,

101
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.720
bringing things to what you're trying to innovate to make

102
00:06:43.721 --> 00:06:47.320
them, you know, in our case more cost-effective was, was really key.

103
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.270
<v 0>Well, I liked the idea of somebody putting out I on engines on like Etsy.</v>

104
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.900
<v 1>Yeah. My, um, advisor at MIT would, you know,</v>

105
00:06:55.901 --> 00:07:00.310
the thruster chip I was holding up, he would wear one as a lapel pin.
