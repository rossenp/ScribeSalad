00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.840
<v 0>That's hilarious, like pre Twitter, early Twitter days,</v>

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.200
you and Jack Dorsey are in a room together talking about JavaScript,

3
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.240
basically solving some kind of menial problem.

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.040
<v 1>Terrible problems. Yeah. I mean, not terrible, just like boring,</v>

5
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.600
boring widget pro I think it was the Odo widget we were working on at the time.

6
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.520
I'm surprised anyone paid me to be in the room as an intern.

7
00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:24.190
Cause I didn't really provide any value.

8
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.630
I'm very thankful to anyone who included me back in the day. Uh,

9
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.790
it was very helpful. So thank you for listening. I.

10
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.150
<v 0>Mean, is there, um, OIA, that's a precursor to Twitter,</v>

11
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.210
first of all,

12
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.070
did you have any anticipation that this Jack Dorsey guy could be also ahead of a

13
00:00:42.071 --> 00:00:45.420
major social network? And, um, second,

14
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.700
did you learn anything from the guy that like that? Do,

15
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.740
do you think it's a coincidence that you two were in the room together

16
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.500
in the it's the coincidence?

17
00:00:55.501 --> 00:01:00.220
Meaning like why does the world play its game in a certain way where these two

18
00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:01.740
founders of social networks?

19
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.410
<v 1>I don't know. It's so weird. Right? Like I, I mean, it's also weird that</v>

20
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.770
mark showed up, you know,

21
00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:14.770
in our fraternity my sophomore year and we got to know each other then like long

22
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.250
before Instagram, it's, it's a small world,

23
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.450
but let me tell a fun story about Jack. Um,

24
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.040
&lt;laugh&gt; we're at OIO and I don't know.

25
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.480
I think EV was feeling like people weren't working hard enough or something

26
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.880
nice. And I can't remember exactly what he,

27
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.640
he created this thing where every Friday,

28
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.000
I don't know if it was every Friday. I only remember this happening once,

29
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.280
but he had a, like a, a statue at its,

30
00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:48.430
like of Mary and in the bottom it's it's hollow. Right.

31
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.390
And I remember on a Friday he decide, uh,

32
00:01:52.391 --> 00:01:56.430
decided he was going to let everyone vote for who had worked the hardest that

33
00:01:56.431 --> 00:01:59.230
week. We all voted closed ballot. Right.

34
00:01:59.231 --> 00:02:01.710
We all put in a bucket and he tallied the votes.

35
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.430
And then whoever got the most votes, as I recall,

36
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.420
got the statuette and in the statuette was a thousand bucks.

37
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.220
Whereas I recall there was a thousand bucks tonight.

38
00:02:12.221 --> 00:02:13.980
It might have been a hundred bucks, but let's call it a thousand.

39
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.700
It's more exciting that way. It felt like a thousand. Yeah, it did. To me,

40
00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:19.940
for sure. I actually got two votes. I was very happy. We were a small company,

41
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.020
but I, as the intern, I got at least two votes. So.

42
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.980
<v 0>Everybody knew how many votes they got individually.</v>

43
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.290
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. And I think it was one of these self accountability things. Anyway,</v>

44
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.890
I remember Jack just getting like the vast majority of votes from everyone.

45
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.370
And I remember just thinking like,

46
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.250
like I couldn't imagine he would become what he'd become and do what he would

47
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.950
do.

48
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.930
But I had a profound respect that the new guy who I

49
00:02:43.931 --> 00:02:48.680
really liked worked that hard and you could see his dedication even

50
00:02:48.681 --> 00:02:50.880
then, and that people respected him.

51
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.480
But that's the one story that I remember of him,

52
00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:55.600
like working with him specifically from that summer.
