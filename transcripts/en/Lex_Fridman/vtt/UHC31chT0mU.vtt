00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.410
<v 0>So, if you had to choose between two athletes, uh,</v>

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.410
who would dominate competition one who drills a hundred thousand reps of

3
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.250
a specific take down specific technique or one that spends that time live.

4
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.530
<v 1>Wrestling, both. Um, it's the same. And I like to live wrestling.</v>

5
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.010
I was always wanting to live wrestling, bring the warm up in the,

6
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.880
of the live wrestle. Let's go. Um, but where I got really,

7
00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:31.720
really good was a repetition and I was disciplined enough to know that the

8
00:00:31.721 --> 00:00:36.360
things that you hate to do in this sport are the things that make you the very

9
00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:37.194
best.

10
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.680
And that is a rare ingredient as I've gotten older and you spend a lot of time

11
00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:43.520
communicating that to younger at the.

12
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.990
<v 0>So the thing, if you feel yourself hating something,</v>

13
00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:49.470
that's probably a thing you should be doing.

14
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.390
<v 1>Yes. As a matter of fact, I had a strength coach when I was really young.</v>

15
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.910
He was just a fricking guy that would, he wore white.

16
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.870
Like he was almost like a nurse nurses' clothes.

17
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.870
He wore all white from head to toe and he was in Cheyenne, white,

18
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.580
me and his first name was Walt.

19
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.620
And he taught Terry and I hate the bar away from you on that last rep when

20
00:01:11.621 --> 00:01:14.420
you're dead. And whether it's a curl, you hate it up.

21
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.780
And then you do the negative and you hate it down and you hate that bench up and

22
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:20.780
you hate it. And you look at the bar and you hate it away from you.

23
00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:24.380
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. So the, you know, I learned and that I was young.

24
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.650
I was young. And, um, I remember being born,

25
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.610
my mom's sister lived out there and we were dropped off to stay out there with

26
00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:35.090
our cousins. And I was born a little bit and they always treated us really good,

27
00:01:35.091 --> 00:01:39.090
but this was like the, the single most, um,

28
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.890
bright spot in a, in a weightlifting like enlightenment,

29
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.490
even though I lifted weights,

30
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.040
but I never knew the psychology behind lifting weights. It's just to look good.

31
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.840
And so you can flex and look in the mirror or is it for performance?

32
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.080
And this guy was about performance.

33
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.280
<v 0>And you said repetition. Do you mean technique?</v>

34
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.440
<v 1>I'm talking repetition technique, technique, technique, drill, drill, drill,</v>

35
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.920
hit, hit, hit drive, finish, hit, hit, hit drive, finish.

36
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.710
So you believe in that you believe that wholeheartedly.

37
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.670
<v 0>So, I mean, uh.</v>

38
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.750
<v 1>And I believe that you have to do it on your own.</v>

39
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.310
I don't believe in the coach taking you to the promised land.

40
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.910
<v 0>So in the guys today or in yourself,</v>

41
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.110
how often do you see people that, uh,

42
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.740
grow the belief of doing 10,000, 20,000 reps?

43
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.540
<v 1>I think it's rare. I think it's very rare. And I think it's especially rare.</v>

44
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.380
I mean, you can talk about that as a coach, but it's especially rare to, uh,

45
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.300
bring a guy to that understanding, but you never stop trying.

46
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.060
You're always trying to reach him. I mean,

47
00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:45.460
we didn't have a good performance out there tonight, but you know what?

48
00:02:45.461 --> 00:02:49.650
You don't stop communicating &lt;affirmative&gt; and there's a lot of

49
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.890
programs out there that put their head down when things aren't going their way.

50
00:02:53.891 --> 00:02:56.530
And then as things start going their way, then they rise with the tide.

51
00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.360
There was no difference in the demeanor that, that, of our corner.

52
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.400
And we talk about that's a philosophy.

53
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.920
And so you're reaching your guys that way. Um,

54
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.680
so go back to your point or your question, you know, do you believe in the,

55
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.040
in the 10,000 reps and yes, I do. And, but.

56
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.720
<v 0>How do you inspire people to do that? So, well, you communicate by example,</v>

57
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.270
but communication, but I mean, that's a, in my experience, what I've seen,

58
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.550
uh, communicating the value of repetition and drilling is a hard.

59
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.271
<v 1>Thing to communicate.</v>

60
00:03:26.271 --> 00:03:30.830
It's hard and it's very rare to have somebody that goes in there and will do it

61
00:03:30.831 --> 00:03:31.664
on their own.

62
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.110
<v 0>Do, do you have young guys that step up and do that? We.</v>

63
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.470
<v 1>Do, and it's rare.</v>

64
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.670
And the guys that do it on their own and have done it on their own,

65
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.140
or that got eyes that are in that lineup and, and doing well. Um,

66
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.100
the other thing is, is that when you talk about, uh, getting to that next level,

67
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.260
um, a lot of times it's, you know,

68
00:03:52.261 --> 00:03:56.220
what held you back was I did everything the coach asked of me and nothing more,

69
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.130
right? I mean, you can be a great guy for a, for an a, for a coach,

70
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.450
as an athlete. And you did everything that coach asked,

71
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.610
but you did nothing more.

72
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.770
<v 0>So you're really looking for the guys that go way beyond what.</v>

73
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.610
<v 1>The coach says. We don't want guys that are looking at their watch,</v>

74
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.410
running out of the room when practice is over.

75
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.840
We want guys that know what they have to get done and might leave early,

76
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.280
but they're not looking at their watch, right? They might be done early.

77
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:27.200
They might be, we might be on a whole different path.

78
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.120
And this guy just excuses himself. I'm all about that. We are not,

79
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.760
we are not autocrats.

80
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.480
<v 0>There's an internal engine in there.</v>

81
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.520
Is that something you're born with or is that something you can.

82
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.990
<v 1>Develop? I think you are born within it. You develop it also.</v>

83
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.430
And I think that there has to be comfort and I go back to the communication that

84
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.790
young people are comfortable enough to communicate that I need

85
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:52.624
to take the day off.

86
00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.560
<v 0>So what do you mean by communication? Just letting exactly so letting,</v>

87
00:04:57.561 --> 00:05:01.870
letting athletes, uh, be part of their own development.

88
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.630
<v 1>Communication to me is, is,</v>

89
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.150
is letting them know what they're,

90
00:05:07.151 --> 00:05:09.830
what they need to do to get themselves in contention,

91
00:05:09.831 --> 00:05:13.990
to be the starting quarterback mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, um, and then to give them

92
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.690
boosts and compliments when they earn them. Um,

93
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.200
and I don't have time to waste with,

94
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.480
um, with lies and cheating. And when I say cheating,

95
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.440
I'm talking about when they cheat themselves. And so there,

96
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.560
those become very direct conversations and the conversation starts like this.

97
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.800
I don't have time to waste it, neither do you.

98
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.040
And so why are we wasting our time?

99
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.870
And here's what I mean at we're having a conversation about, you know,

100
00:05:45.871 --> 00:05:50.430
your accountability. If you look in the mirror and you're accountable,

101
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.310
then we are, we aren't taking the time to go through this.

102
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.470
We're already on our way to solving the problem. Problem.

103
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.640
Can't be solved without that understanding.

104
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.120
And that's has to do with symptoms that you see in the wrestling room.

105
00:06:03.121 --> 00:06:05.560
There's something where the fire's not quite there that has do with mental,

106
00:06:05.561 --> 00:06:08.800
emotional, spiritual, physical, got it, everything,

107
00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:10.760
everything that you know about, you know,

108
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.160
I had a boss and our athletic director is a great athletic director and he gives

109
00:06:15.161 --> 00:06:17.830
us everything. We need to be &lt;affirmative&gt;, but I had a boss,

110
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.590
his name was Fred Mims, and I didn't think anybody could be better than him.

111
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.830
And then all of a sudden this Jean Taylor guy came in and I didn't,

112
00:06:23.831 --> 00:06:27.030
and then he was pretty do gone good too. And he actually, you know,

113
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.470
was just like Fred and maybe even a little bit more current mm-hmm

114
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.551
&lt;affirmative&gt;.

115
00:06:30.551 --> 00:06:33.070
And then he ended up taking a job at Kansas state where he's an athletic

116
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.540
director now. And, uh, and then this, this lady Barbara Burke in,

117
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.420
and I didn't think anybody could be better than Jean Taylor or Fred Mims.

118
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.380
And this Barbara Burke she's better than both of 'em.

119
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.740
And the reason why is because she's a problem solver, she doesn't waste time.

120
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.900
She's direct and she's a problem solver, and that's what we need.

121
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.300
You need problem solvers.
