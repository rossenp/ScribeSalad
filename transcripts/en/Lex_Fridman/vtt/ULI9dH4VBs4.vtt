1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.560
<v 0>You, uh, love movies and read this somewhere. Yeah. You mentioned blade runner.</v>

2
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.580
<v 1>Favorite number one of all time. The final cut. That's my go-to. So you.</v>

3
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.270
<v 0>Say, uh, blade runner is the greatest movie of all time.</v>

4
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.550
<v 1>It's one of the greatest movies of all time. My top, my top five,</v>

5
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.120
uh, blade runner final cut. This.

6
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.200
<v 0>Is the original blade.</v>

7
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.150
<v 1>Runner and I used to own on tape the original DHS</v>

8
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:34.590
cut. And, um, and I had the director's cut on DVD. Why.

9
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.760
<v 0>Blade runner, by the way.</v>

10
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.690
<v 1>What a kid? I just thought it was so cool.</v>

11
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.720
There was something about it really spoke to me the whole cyberpunk landscapes

12
00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:47.250
and, uh, you know, this guy chasing down rogue, uh,

13
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.860
Androids, replicants and all this.

14
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.790
<v 0>Is it just the entire cyber punky university?</v>

15
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.550
<v 1>No, it's I mean, the cyberpunk universe is part of it. Uh, on the,</v>

16
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:00.960
on the surface, I have a,

17
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.980
I've always tended towards dark subject matter, uh,

18
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.200
like things that are of the dark,

19
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.710
so to speak are things that I've always been gravitated towards.

20
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.910
I think maybe part of it is that the things that are darker are more

21
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.130
accepting and

22
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.050
more upfront with death.

23
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.530
And perhaps I think that maybe that is what was, uh,

24
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.930
somehow perhaps there's also the aspect of a rebellious newness.

25
00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:32.340
Usually, like there was, um,

26
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.010
I was never one to want to just do what somebody told me

27
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:39.960
to do, you know? Um,

28
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.670
I'm not sitting around trying to always be

29
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.810
such a radical individual that I can't take orders. No, in fact,

30
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.550
I'm more than willing to take orders from somebody that I feel is

31
00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:57.660
competent and has merit and reason behind what they're doing and it makes it

32
00:01:57.661 --> 00:01:59.910
like, okay, yeah, I'm a hundred percent for it.

33
00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:01.230
Not only will it kind of take orders,

34
00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:05.310
I will help you achieve whatever it is if I think it's worthwhile, um,

35
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.180
even at my own expense. But, uh,

36
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.800
to get to that point is a rarity. It's just not, not a given.

37
00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:17.100
And so you can even imagine like being a grade school teacher and this kid

38
00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:19.230
doesn't respect you and he doesn't really think you're that smart.

39
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.260
They don't really appreciate that. But, um.

40
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.660
<v 0>So cyberpunk is number one. What else.</v>

41
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.080
<v 1>Is kind of number one? It's a, it's an environment I love, but at the same time,</v>

42
00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:32.610
Conan the barbarian by John Millie is one of my favorite films of all time. Uh,

43
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.580
and you know,

44
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:39.630
that's such a pure film in a way like the motivations are pure.

45
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.660
They're very easy to follow,

46
00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:46.740
but not lacking in depth. You know, it's not,

47
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.950
it's not just explosions and, and teal and orange it's, uh, it's,

48
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.900
it's more on the human condition and I love it and it's

49
00:02:57.901 --> 00:03:02.440
shot incredibly well. It's got an incredible soundtrack. Yeah, love it.

50
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:05.080
But with blade runner also in a deeper sense, you know, again,

51
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:07.720
the human condition, you know, or you, you start seeing like what, what is,

52
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:10.420
what is being, what does it being human, uh, you know,

53
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:15.100
how does this relate to what if you can make it and you can tell it what to do

54
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.420
at what point is it like you should, or you shouldn't, you know,

55
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:22.150
why do you get to determine what's alive? And what's not,

56
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:25.840
what's a life that should be allowed to live and what isn't and

57
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.020
what would be the strain of being Roy batty and

58
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:35.290
seeing all these incredible moments that

59
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.490
with his passing will no longer exist,

60
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.500
especially if he hasn't had a chance to put that flame into another torch,

61
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.480
so to speak. If he hasn't written them down,

62
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:49.120
if he hasn't passed them down to somebody else,

63
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.750
it had gone like tears in the rain.

64
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.780
<v 0>That scene is incredible. Uh, I mean,</v>

65
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:58.690
but it's funny cause those two universities have very different corners of the

66
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:00.600
barbarian and cyber punk.

67
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.180
Is there that makes me curious about what else might be in list?

68
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.510
<v 1>Uh, well let me think. And it's a pretty.</v>

69
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:10.580
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

70
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.381
<v 1>No, no. I mean,</v>

71
00:04:11.381 --> 00:04:14.530
I'm sure the God I've never actually even watched the whole godfather, but also.

72
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.300
<v 0>Like, like casino.</v>

73
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.700
<v 1>Goodfellas. It was a good movie, but no, that's not in my top. It's,</v>

74
00:04:19.701 --> 00:04:23.770
it's a good flick. Uh, but it doesn't really do it for me. Uh, I,

75
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.100
if people really want to get into this a little more, I did make a hundred,

76
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.090
a list of a hundred, a hundred of my favorite movies on my Facebook fan page.

77
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.050
Uh, but, uh, do you remember like, oh yeah,

78
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:39.820
like blazing saddles is on their original, the lost Ark, um, uh,

79
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.630
Valhalla rising by Nicholas from winding Ruffin, uh, uh,

80
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.220
maniac by, uh, William Lustig. Uh,

81
00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:52.630
it's a 1980 gnarly video,

82
00:04:52.631 --> 00:04:56.650
nasty horror movie about a serial killer, uh,

83
00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.730
who murders women and scalps them. Uh,

84
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.560
and it's gnarly as hell and very brutal and very bleak and very, uh,

85
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.530
um, I mean,

86
00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:11.020
it's the kind of thing that like a lot of people would have a real hard time

87
00:05:11.021 --> 00:05:15.580
watching, but, uh, one again, I like things that are dark,

88
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.473
but two,

89
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.950
I thought the performances were fantastic in this film and they really got out.

90
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.830
I think the underlying thing was, and it was, you know,

91
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.600
there was a guy who was basically just like run a muck by the

92
00:05:28.601 --> 00:05:32.980
overbearing mother, uh, union archetype. And it, she was,

93
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.610
she had parked her in sanity into him and he,

94
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.940
but yet there was this aspect you could see of him,

95
00:05:39.941 --> 00:05:44.680
of him wanting to try and actually be able to be in the world and have

96
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.720
love and have, uh, uh,

97
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.230
feminine companionship to go with his masculine

98
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.093
aspect.

99
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.430
But he had no way of understanding how to really make that happen.

100
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.180
And he had a complete negative connotation to the feminine.

101
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.750
So it's his struggle with it. And there's a little part in the,

102
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.510
in the movie where he somehow comes across this

103
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.210
model or something. And they actually,

104
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.760
he starts to feel like maybe he might be able to actually have a relationship

105
00:06:19.761 --> 00:06:24.020
with somebody and it goes somewhere. But, uh, yeah, uh,

106
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.430
even the Elijah would remake,

107
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:29.540
I felt was really well done and captured most of the essence of what the movie

108
00:06:29.541 --> 00:06:32.480
was about, but I still feel like the original, by the way,

109
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.460
I'm Lustig is the best.

110
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.220
<v 0>What's the greatest, uh, love.</v>

111
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.970
<v 1>Movie of all time and his love movie of all time.</v>

112
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.030
<v 0>So like something more love is, I mean,</v>

113
00:06:43.031 --> 00:06:45.250
I suppose love underlies most of these movies.

114
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.810
<v 1>And especially in somewhere, I mean,</v>

115
00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:51.130
hell to cache me case films are all about family, of all things.

116
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.810
It hasn't bonkers as those movies.

117
00:06:52.811 --> 00:06:57.760
Are they the general theme is family almost entirely all of

118
00:06:57.761 --> 00:06:59.380
his films? Uh.

119
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.590
<v 0>Yeah, that was very, I mean, even you can argue blade runner. Yeah.</v>

120
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.060
<v 1>Because I love film of all time. Uh,</v>

121
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.310
let's enjoy, I mean, is Excalibur a film about love? Uh,

122
00:07:12.311 --> 00:07:16.600
what's this cava king Arthur caliber is about,

123
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:18.430
uh, Arthur, uh,

124
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.350
becoming king of the Britons and his love of his country and his love of

125
00:07:23.351 --> 00:07:27.280
Guinevere. But eventually, yeah, it becomes more of about,

126
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.310
um, the,

127
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:34.270
the necessity for the king to love to,

128
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:38.230
to hold hold Excalibur, to stay,

129
00:07:38.231 --> 00:07:40.450
tend to realize that while if you're the king,

130
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.640
you can love your wife and you can love your best friend and they may

131
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:50.140
each other behind your back. And as they fall in love too,

132
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.590
but at the end of the day, you're responsible, your, your love has to be to the,

133
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:58.120
to the country and everyone else first and not your own personal, uh,

134
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.430
wants, which, you know,

135
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.440
made a much more interesting story when you have, uh, Carmen Brenna and,

136
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.950
and art. Oh, what does that one is?

137
00:08:08.951 --> 00:08:11.770
It's a German opera, but, uh, you know,

138
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:16.660
and the horses and slow-mo and sword fights and an epic death scene between,

139
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.350
uh, Arthur and his, his son. Okay. Now I definitely have to.

140
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.180
<v 0>Watch it and I haven't washed it and embarrassed.</v>

141
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.530
<v 1>It's, uh,</v>

142
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:28.600
it is John Boorman's second film in Hollywood, his first one being,

143
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:29.980
uh, point blank with Lee, Marvin,

144
00:08:29.981 --> 00:08:34.690
which is also on top of one of the upper echelon movies on my list, uh,

145
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.610
derived from a book by called the outfit by,

146
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.860
uh, what is his name? Uh, I forget,

147
00:08:44.861 --> 00:08:48.760
but Darwin cook comics illustrator. He did Donald Westlake road.

148
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.350
So Darwin cooked is,

149
00:08:50.351 --> 00:08:54.580
does an amazing comic book send up of Donald Cook's novels and they are

150
00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:00.120
incredible. So anyways, but, uh, the point blank, what lean Marvin,

151
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:05.700
uh, you know, it's a man driven by purpose revenge,

152
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:10.620
but also by like really pure motivations, he wants his money. He was,

153
00:09:10.621 --> 00:09:14.010
he was betrayed in, he wants his,

154
00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:17.580
his cash because this is what he agreed to do. The thing for. And this is,

155
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.090
which also is part of the reason why like no country for old men so much,

156
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.260
which I felt was a great, great movie, even better book. But, uh,

157
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.330
I remember talking to my friend and I go, you know,

158
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.700
Anton Chigurh is the most pure human being in that whole book. Well,

159
00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:37.560
that guy's the villain I go, is he evil again?

160
00:09:37.561 --> 00:09:41.640
He's the one he lies to no one, he does everything he says he will do.

161
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.210
He always follows his word. And on the rare occasion, he,

162
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:49.020
he allows fate to make a decision. As he figures like, well, whatever,

163
00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:52.710
all let us to here will, will, will lead us one way or the other.

164
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:54.990
And if we're at this crossroads, what,

165
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:58.620
how is there any better or worse way than to do it over a coin flip?

166
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:03.450
And so that whole scene where the guy's going, well, what am I putting up?

167
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:07.020
And he goes, everything. You've been putting it up every day of your life.

168
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:11.280
And that's true. Everything we do as a, as a, as a, as a decision,

169
00:10:11.281 --> 00:10:16.040
as a calling as a, as a choice. And, and then, uh, bummed me out that they,

170
00:10:16.041 --> 00:10:20.370
they reduced the last interaction between sugar and,

171
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.320
uh, what's his face, his life. And he finally finds her and she's like,

172
00:10:25.321 --> 00:10:27.720
you don't have to do this. I mean, she's, he's like, yes, yes I do.

173
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.070
This is the way it is.

174
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:31.980
You can think that your life could have turned out any sort of ways you could

175
00:10:31.981 --> 00:10:33.630
have done this. You're kind of in that. But the reality is,

176
00:10:33.631 --> 00:10:36.270
and this is the way your life is. And it's the way it was always going to be.

177
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.320
You know, the fact that I'm here is the end of it. And that's that?

178
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.050
<v 0>Yeah, it's fine. If you're honest,</v>

179
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.300
this will dark movies revealed that the villains are the,

180
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:52.350
the purest of humans and can teach us the most profound

181
00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:54.960
lessons. And that's, that's certainly a good example of it.
