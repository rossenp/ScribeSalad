00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.290
<v 0>So as a CEO, let me ask you a question, cuz leadership matters.</v>

2
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.650
It's a complicated question. &lt;laugh&gt; why is mark Zuckerberg, distrusted,

3
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.850
disliked, and sometimes even hated by many people in public.

4
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.970
<v 1>Right? That is a complicated question. Um, well the premise is,</v>

5
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.620
I'm not sure I agree with the premise. Um.

6
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.500
<v 0>And I can,</v>

7
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.380
I can expand that to include even a more mysterious question for

8
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.660
me, bill gates.

9
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.620
<v 1>Hmm. What, what is the bill gates version of the question?</v>

10
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.700
Do you think people hate bill gates?

11
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.690
<v 0>Uh, no distrust. Ah, so, uh, take away one it's a,</v>

12
00:00:46.691 --> 00:00:47.524
it's a checklist.

13
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.450
Uh there's I think mark Zuckerberg's distrust is the primary one,

14
00:00:53.451 --> 00:00:57.770
but there's also like a, like a dislike, maybe Hayes, the strong award,

15
00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:58.211
but it's just,

16
00:00:58.211 --> 00:01:02.730
if you look at like the articles that are being written and so on,

17
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.480
Hmm.

18
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.120
There's a dislike and it makes it's confusing to me because it's like the public

19
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.200
picks certain individuals and they,

20
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.480
and they attach certain kinds of emotions to those.

21
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.960
<v 1>Individuals. Yeah. So someone once, uh, just recently said,</v>

22
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.120
there's this strong case that founder led companies have this problem and that a

23
00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:27.070
lot of Mark's issue use, um, come today,

24
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.230
come from the fact that he is a visible founder with this

25
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.750
story that people have watched in both a movie and they followed along and he's

26
00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:39.950
this boy wonder kid who became one of the world's richest people. And,

27
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.590
and he's no longer marked the person he's marked this, this image of,

28
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.460
of a person with enormous wealth and power. And in today's world,

29
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.500
we, we have issues with enormous wealth and power for a variety of reasons.

30
00:01:54.501 --> 00:01:58.620
One of which is we've been stuck inside, you know, for a year and a half,

31
00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.820
two years. Uh,

32
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.180
one of which is a lot of people were really unhappy about not the last election,

33
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.450
but the last, last election. And where do you take out that? Anger?

34
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.330
Who do you blame?

35
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.210
But the people in charge that's one example or one reason why? I think,

36
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.730
um, a lot of people, uh,

37
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.010
express anger or resentment or unhappiness with,

38
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.970
with mark at the same time. I don't know. I pointed out to that person.

39
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.720
I was like, well, I don't know, know,

40
00:02:26.721 --> 00:02:31.400
like I think a lot of people really like Elon, like Elon, arguably,

41
00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:34.760
like he kept his, you know, factory open here throughout COVID protocols,

42
00:02:34.761 --> 00:02:38.800
which arguably a lot of people would be against, um.

43
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.240
<v 0>While saying a bunch of, uh, crazy offensive things on the internet. They still,</v>

44
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.880
uh, and like.

45
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.630
<v 1>Basically, you know, gives the middle finger to the S E like on Twitter.</v>

46
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.510
And like, I don't know. I'm like, well, there's a founder.

47
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.390
And like people kinda like him.

48
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.670
<v 0>I, I, so I do think that the, so like the,</v>

49
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.880
the founder and slash CEO of a company,

50
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.320
that's a social network company is like an extra level of difficulty. If,

51
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.840
if life is a video game, you just chose the harder video game. So, I mean,

52
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:14.720
that's why it's interesting to ask you because you were the founder and CEO.

53
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.150
Yeah. That of a social network. Right? Exactly. I challenge it because, so, but,

54
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.890
but you're one of the rare examples,

55
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.690
even Jack Dorsey's disliked, not to the degree,

56
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.730
but it just seems harder when you're running a social media company.

57
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.610
<v 1>It's interesting. I, I never thought of Jack as just like,</v>

58
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.290
I think generally he's well respected. Um.

59
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.960
<v 0>Yeah, I think so. I, I think you're right, but like he's, but he's not loved.</v>

60
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.800
Yeah. And I, and I feel like you, I mean, to me, Twitter's an incredible thing.

61
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.640
<v 1>Yeah. And again, can I just come back to this point,</v>

62
00:03:49.641 --> 00:03:51.840
which seems over simplistic, but like,

63
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.920
I really do think how a product makes someone feel. Yeah.

64
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.030
They ascribe that feeling to the founder. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; uh.

65
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.390
<v 0>So, so make people feel good. So.</v>

66
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.510
<v 1>Think about it. Like, let's just go with this thesis for a second. Sure. Okay.</v>

67
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.630
I like it though. Um, Amazon's pretty utilitarian, right?

68
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.190
It delivers brown boxes to your front door. Sure.

69
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.990
You can have Alexa and you can have all these things. Right.

70
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.540
But in general it delivers stuff quickly to you at a reasonable price. Right.

71
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.420
I think Jeff Bezos is wonderfully wealthy, thoughtful, smart guy. Right.

72
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.580
But like, people kind of feel that way about him. They're like, wow,

73
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.420
this is really big. We're impressed that this is really big. And, but they,

74
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.020
he he's doing the same space stuff Elon's doing,

75
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:41.250
but they don't necessarily ascribe the same sense of wonder. Right.

76
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.050
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um, now let's take Elon. Uh, and again, this is pet theory.

77
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.170
I, I don't have much proof other than my own intuition. Um,

78
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.210
he is literally about living the future Mars spa.

79
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.250
It's about wonder it's about going back to that feeling as a kid,

80
00:04:56.251 --> 00:04:59.130
when you looked up to the stars and asked, is there life out there,

81
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.520
people get behind behind that because it's a sense of hope and excitement and,

82
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.000
and, and innovation. And like, you can say whatever you want, but we,

83
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.200
we ascribe that emotion to that person.

84
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.640
Now let's say you're on a social network and people make you kind of angry cuz

85
00:05:15.641 --> 00:05:17.840
they disagree with you or they say something ridiculous.

86
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.000
Or they're living a FOMO type life where you're like, wow,

87
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.070
I wish I was doing in that thing. I think Instagram,

88
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.470
if I were to think back by and large, when I was,

89
00:05:27.471 --> 00:05:31.990
there was not about FOMO was not about this influencer economy,

90
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.870
although it certainly became that way closer to the end.

91
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.150
It was about this sense of wonder and happiness and beautiful things in the

92
00:05:39.151 --> 00:05:42.780
world. And I don't know. I mean, like I don't wanna have a blind spot,

93
00:05:42.781 --> 00:05:44.900
but I don't think anyone had a strong opinion about.

94
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.180
<v 0>One way or the other for the longest time, the way people explain to me. I mean,</v>

95
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.140
if you want to go for toxicity, you go to Facebook or Twitter.

96
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.020
If you want to go to make feel good about life,

97
00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:56.580
you go to Instagram to enjoy celebrate life. That would.

98
00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.400
<v 1>And my experience been talking to people is they gave me the benefit of the</v>

99
00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:00.640
doubt because of that. Yeah.

100
00:06:00.641 --> 00:06:03.720
But if your experience of the product is kind of makes you angry,

101
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.160
it's where you argue. I mean,

102
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.920
a big part of Jack might be that he wasn't actually the CEO for a very long time

103
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.000
and only became recently. So I'm not sure how much of the connection got made.

104
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.750
Um, but in Jeff, I mean, if you hate, you.

105
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.910
<v 0>Know, I'm just thinking about other companies that are in tech companies,</v>

106
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.070
if you hate like what a company is doing or,

107
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.030
or it makes you not feel happy &lt;laugh&gt; I don't know,

108
00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:31.310
like people are really angry about Comcast or whatever,

109
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.230
or they even called Comcast anymore. It's like Xfinity or something. Right.

110
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:39.300
They had to rebrand. They, they became met. Right? Yeah. Um, it's like, uh,

111
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.380
but my point is if it makes you angry, that's beautiful. Yeah. But the thing is,

112
00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.020
this is me saying this,

113
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.940
I think your thesis is very strong and correct has elements of

114
00:06:51.941 --> 00:06:56.700
correctness, but I still personally put some blame on

115
00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.850
individuals. Of course, I think, uh, course. Yeah.

116
00:06:59.851 --> 00:07:02.130
You said Elon looking up,

117
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.370
there's something about childlike wander to him, like to, to his personality,

118
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:11.770
his character, something about, I think more so than others,

119
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.810
what people can trust him. And there's uh, I don't know,

120
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.930
son cha an example of somebody who's like,

121
00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.840
there's some kind it's, it's hard to put into words,

122
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:26.400
but there's something about the human being where he's trustworthy. Yeah.

123
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:31.560
He's, he's human in a way that, uh, connects to us and the same with, uh,

124
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.280
Sergeant Nadella. I mean, some of these folks, um,

125
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:41.310
something about is drawn to them, even when they're flawed, even like,

126
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:42.170
um,

127
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:46.510
so like your thesis really holds up for Steve jobs because I think people didn't

128
00:07:46.511 --> 00:07:49.630
like Steve jobs, but like he delivered products that,

129
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:53.430
and then they fell in love every time. &lt;laugh&gt; uh, I,

130
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.710
I guess you could say that the CEO, the leader is also a product

131
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:02.580
and if they keep bring a product that people like by being in public and saying

132
00:08:02.581 --> 00:08:06.140
things that people like, that's also a way to make people happy.
