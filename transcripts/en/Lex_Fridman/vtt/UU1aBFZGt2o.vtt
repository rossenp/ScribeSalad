00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.113
<v 0>Uh, let me ask you,</v>

2
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.960
in terms of that kid in the garage or those couple of kids in the garage,

3
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.520
what advice would you give to them?

4
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.080
If they wanna start a new social network or a business,

5
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.000
what advice would you give to somebody with a big dream and a young startup?

6
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.090
<v 1>To me, you have to choose to do something that even if it fails,</v>

7
00:00:22.091 --> 00:00:25.360
like you it's, it was so fun, right?

8
00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:29.160
Like we never started Instagram knowing it was going to be big.

9
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.840
We started Instagram because we loved photography. We loved social networks.

10
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.920
I had seen what other social networks had done and I thought, Hmm,

11
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.920
maybe we did a spin on this, but like nowhere was our feet predestined.

12
00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:46.390
Like it wasn't like wasn't written out anywhere that everything was gonna go

13
00:00:46.391 --> 00:00:50.230
great. And I often think that counterfactual, like what if it had not gone well,

14
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.710
and I would been like, I don't know, that was fun. We raised some money,

15
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.070
we learned some stuff. And,

16
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.270
and does it position you well for the next experience,

17
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.590
that's the advice that I would give to anyone wanting to start something today,

18
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.300
which is like, does this meet with your ultimate goals? Not wealth,

19
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.860
not fame, none of that, because all of that, by the way is.

20
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.220
Like you can get super famous and super wealthy. And I like,

21
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.140
I think generally those are not things that, again,

22
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:21.540
it's easy to say with like a lot of money that somehow,

23
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.660
like it's not good to have a lot of money. It's just,

24
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.610
I think that complicates life enormously in a way that people don't fully

25
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.690
comprehend. So I think it is way more interesting to shoot for.

26
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.690
Can I make something that people love that provides value in the world that I

27
00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:39.770
love building that I love working on that. Right. That's um,

28
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.860
that's what I would do if I were starting from scratch. And by the way,

29
00:01:43.861 --> 00:01:47.210
like in some ways that I will do that personally, which is like,

30
00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:51.450
choose the thing that you get up every morning. You're like, I love this.

31
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.850
Even when it's painful.

32
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.170
<v 0>Even when it's painful. What about a social network specifically?</v>

33
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.730
If you were to imagine, put yourself in the mind.

34
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.410
<v 1>As some, oh, compete against myself. I can't give out ideas. Okay. I gotcha.</v>

35
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.760
<v 0>No, but like high level, you focus on community. Yeah. I mean.</v>

36
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.400
<v 1>I, I, I said that as a, as a half joke, um, in all honesty,</v>

37
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.080
I think these things are so hard to build that like, ideas are a dime a dozen,

38
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.493
but, um.

39
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.000
<v 0>You have to talked about keeping it simple. Can I tell you,</v>

40
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.353
which is a liberating idea?

41
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.430
<v 1>It's three circles and they overlap one circle is, uh,</v>

42
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.990
what do I have experienced at slash what am I good at? I don't like saying,

43
00:02:34.991 --> 00:02:36.990
what am I good at? Because it just like, seems like,

44
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.750
what do I have experience in, right. What can I bring to the table?

45
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.430
What am I excited about is the other circle? What gets, what's just super cool,

46
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.420
right. That I wanna work on. Because even when this is hard, um,

47
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.300
I think it's so cool. I wanna stick with it.

48
00:02:52.301 --> 00:02:55.580
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and the last circle is like, what does the world need?

49
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.020
And if that circle ain't there, it doesn't matter what you work on.

50
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.200
Cause there are a lot of startups that exist that just no one needs or very

51
00:03:03.201 --> 00:03:07.600
small markets need, but if you wanna be successful, I think if you're like,

52
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.880
if you're good at it, you have it. Sorry. If you're good at it,

53
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.480
if you're passionate about it and the world needs it. I mean,

54
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.433
this sounds simple,

55
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.760
but not enough people sit down and just think about those circles and think,

56
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.510
do these things overlap. And can I get that middle section it's small,

57
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.830
but can I get that middle section? Um, I think a lot about that personally.

58
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.430
<v 0>And then you have to be really honest about the circle that you're good at</v>

59
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.470
and really honest about the circle that, uh, the world needs.

60
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.300
And as a really honest about the passion, like, what do you actually love?

61
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.140
Yeah. As opposed to like some kind of dream of making money,

62
00:03:46.141 --> 00:03:47.700
all those kind of stuff, like literally.

63
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:48.813
<v 1>Love doing. I had a,</v>

64
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.900
a former engineer who decided to start a startup and I was like,

65
00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:56.260
are you sure you wanna start a company versus like join something else? Because,

66
00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:57.710
um,

67
00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.890
being a coach of an MBA team &lt;affirmative&gt; and playing basketball are two very,

68
00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:02.724
very different things.

69
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.610
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and like not everyone fully understands the difference.

70
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.810
I think you can kind of do it both. Um,

71
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.280
and I don't know jury's out on that one because like they're in the middle of it

72
00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:19.920
now, so, but it's really important to figure out what you're good at.

73
00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.750
Be full of yourself. Like truly look at your track record. Um,

74
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.870
what's the saying, like, it ain't bragging if you could, if you,

75
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.230
if you can do it. Um,

76
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.710
but too many people are delusional and, and, and like,

77
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.790
think they're better at things than they actually are,

78
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.870
or think there's a bigger market than there actually is.

79
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.460
Just when you confuse your passion for things with a big market,

80
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.420
that's really scary. Right. Like,

81
00:04:45.421 --> 00:04:48.060
just because you think it's cool doesn't mean that it's a big business

82
00:04:48.061 --> 00:04:51.740
opportunity. So like what evidence do you have? Again, I'm a fairly, like,

83
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.540
I'm a strict rationalist on this. And like,

84
00:04:54.541 --> 00:04:57.940
sometimes people don't like working with me because I'm pretty pragmatic about

85
00:04:57.941 --> 00:05:00.900
things. Like, I, I'm not, I'm not Elon.

86
00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:05.770
Like I don't sit and make bold proclamations about visiting Mars.

87
00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:08.650
Like, that's just not how I work. I'm like, okay,

88
00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:11.130
I wanna build this really cool thing. That's fairly practical.

89
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.290
And I think we could do it. And it's in this way. And what's cool though,

90
00:05:15.291 --> 00:05:18.410
is like, that's just my sweet spot. I'm not like mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. I just,

91
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.200
I can't, I can't with a straight face. Talk about the metaphor. I can't, I just,

92
00:05:22.201 --> 00:05:23.480
it's not me. Um.

93
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.360
<v 0>What do you think about the, the Facebook renaming it itself? To me, I.</v>

94
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.160
<v 1>Didn't mean that as a dig, I just literally like, I'm, I'm fairly,</v>

95
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.360
I like to live in the next five years and like what,

96
00:05:33.361 --> 00:05:38.360
what things can I get out in a year that people will use at scale? And, um,

97
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.320
so it's just, again, those circles I think are different for different,

98
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.590
but it's important to realize that like market matters,

99
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.830
you being good at it matters and having passion for it matters.
