00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.710
<v 0>Uh, so you started talking about smart contracts, but, uh,</v>

2
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.430
let's zoom back out and ask, uh,

3
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.270
the big question here is what is a blockchain and what is a.

4
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:14.103
<v 1>Cryptocurrency?</v>

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.430
So a blockchain is just a ledger and really it has three nice properties.

6
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:19.550
You're timestamped,

7
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.220
you're imutable and auditable either in a global or a local sense. And so know,

8
00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:24.260
there's all kinds of things.

9
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.580
Mankind has invented where it's really important that you,

10
00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:30.220
when you put some information down,

11
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.940
it doesn't change and other people can see it. Uh, and that, you know,

12
00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:37.140
when it was put down, for example, a property ledger.

13
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.460
So when you buy land or you have rights associated with land,

14
00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:44.330
like mineral rights or water rights, or these things you'd like to,

15
00:00:44.331 --> 00:00:47.690
transitively see, how does it go from Alice to Bob, to Charlie,

16
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.770
to Jim and so forth. And, uh,

17
00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:52.130
what was the state of these things as they were transitioning?

18
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.570
So how much did they pay, uh, you know, when did it occur, et cetera, et cetera,

19
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.250
the metadata that follows that. Okay, well,

20
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.130
normally these types of ledgers are so important that their manage either by

21
00:01:03.131 --> 00:01:06.680
governments are regulat at entities and the issues, uh,

22
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.240
are that while they can be efficient,

23
00:01:08.241 --> 00:01:11.400
they're generally brittle to political manipulation.

24
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.160
And they're brittle to geopolitical events. For example,

25
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.120
when Syria fell apart, you know,

26
00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:19.400
the very first thing ISIS did is they started saying, Hey,

27
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.840
the ownership of the land, it's gonna fundamentally change. We've decided that,

28
00:01:23.841 --> 00:01:26.030
you know, this guy over here and now own all these things.

29
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.150
And then when peace comes, like, how do you unwind all of that?

30
00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:31.630
Put it all back together. Uh, so the,

31
00:01:31.631 --> 00:01:36.510
the power of a blockchain is that it gives you a transnational way of sorting

32
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:39.510
all these details out and putting all together in a, in, in,

33
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.550
in a place that you know, that even if it's inconvenient to a very powerful,

34
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.900
that it will still stay preserved. This is, uh,

35
00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:53.060
an asymmetry we haven't had as a society, usually Kings and empires.

36
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.060
They have the ability to decide what's true. Uh,

37
00:01:56.061 --> 00:01:59.020
and then suddenly you have this asymmetrical thing that is above them,

38
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.860
kind of like a synthetic laws of physics. And once something goes in there,

39
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.370
you know, that that's there. Okay. So that's the first part of it.

40
00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:11.770
The second part of it is that it's auditable,

41
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.730
meaning that instead of saying only the high cleric or the president,

42
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.970
or, you know, some very special club of people get to see what's going on.

43
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.050
Suddenly now all the people can actually see who owns what, where like I'm my,

44
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.840
at you in a tax system where, you know, the pro probably just leaked, um, the,

45
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.040
the taxes of all these different billionaires and said, well,

46
00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:33.360
how much do they make and how much do they pay?

47
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.560
Imagine a tax system where that's just done by default or any other social

48
00:02:38.561 --> 00:02:42.320
systems where this type of information is put in by default. So, uh,

49
00:02:42.321 --> 00:02:46.080
it's tremendously useful, uh, this type of structure and all kinds of things,

50
00:02:46.081 --> 00:02:48.270
medical records, supply chains, you know,

51
00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:51.030
just a good thought experiment is I travel a lot.

52
00:02:51.031 --> 00:02:53.190
I've been to 52 countries in the last five years.

53
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.470
Imagine if I got sick in Zimbabwe, you know, like hit by a car or something,

54
00:02:57.471 --> 00:02:58.304
and I'm unconscious.

55
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.120
And as Zimbabwe and doctor calls my doctor in Colorado and says, Hey, you know,

56
00:03:02.121 --> 00:03:04.320
I, I need all Charles's medical records. Uh, you know,

57
00:03:04.321 --> 00:03:08.360
he's unconscious right now. Uh, but I need it to treat him cuz he's quite ill.

58
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.120
Uh, they'd say, who is this person in Zimbabwe? Why? I don't know you.

59
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.280
I can't give you his records. I need his consent. Oh no,

60
00:03:14.281 --> 00:03:17.040
he's unconscious in the hospital. Can't do it. Well,

61
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.510
a broker system that would allow movement of medical records,

62
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:22.270
would it be an example of what a blockchain could potentially do in the

63
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:23.104
foreseeable future?

64
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.150
Cryptocurrency is just an application that runs on top of blockchain, cuz it,

65
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.790
it turns out that when you issue property, you also can issue tokens of value.

66
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.190
And then you could have a monetary policy can be inflationary or deflationary

67
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.820
you dage where it decays over time or whatever have you. Uh,

68
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.020
and the very same mechanics that would ensure your property records are secure.

69
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:47.900
Your medical record access to secure could also be applied for the ownership of

70
00:03:47.901 --> 00:03:49.220
the cryptocurrency. And again,

71
00:03:49.221 --> 00:03:52.540
you can either be completely transparent and everybody can see what everybody

72
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:56.780
owns and that's what Bitcoin does. Or you can be as OPEC as you seek to be.

73
00:03:56.781 --> 00:03:59.340
That's what Z cash basically attempts to do. It says, Hey,

74
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.210
let's keep these things as private as possible,

75
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.530
but they have relatively the same mechanics in terms of those properties of

76
00:04:04.531 --> 00:04:07.570
auditability and timestamping, and imutability, you know,

77
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:09.250
things won't be reversed. You know,

78
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:12.050
that people aren't gonna manipulate the timestamps and uh,

79
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.090
you can audit at least enough to know that the ownership is right.
