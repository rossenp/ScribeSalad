00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.680
<v 0>Speaking about the world being completely. Uh, Alex Jones turned on Q Anon.</v>

2
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.770
I know almost.

3
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.690
<v 1>Tough, Matt. They had a rough marriage, they fought it.</v>

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.020
They fought it out for years. Uh,

5
00:00:14.021 --> 00:00:16.460
and eventually we just knew someone was going to leave.

6
00:00:16.461 --> 00:00:20.300
Someone tried to leave him a few months ago. Oh,

7
00:00:20.301 --> 00:00:25.280
so what's his name and else's house. The car wasn't in the driveway. Um,

8
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.200
yeah. Well, the thing about,

9
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.130
and that makes it a lot of fun is it's kind of a make it up as you go along.

10
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.080
I've I'm a drug addict, right? So often my lives aren't planned.

11
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.020
They're in the moment, a lot of what I do on the podcast a lot, you know,

12
00:00:39.021 --> 00:00:39.800
it's all in the moment.

13
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.900
I'll have an idea of what I want to talk about and I rant and I go, yeah.

14
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.770
And I've been like stoned and I show up at home and my parents were like,

15
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.660
what's going on? There was $50 on the mantle now it's not there. And I'm like,

16
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.930
well, and I got to make something up on the spot, right? I've been, you know,

17
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.650
are you drinking again? No, I'm not.

18
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.200
And then you had to have a while you were gone for two days,

19
00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:06.090
no one knows where you are and somebody said you left your car. Well, I was,

20
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.820
well, this is, I was at a sales conference and I left my car. I flew to Phoenix.

21
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.290
Like I understand what that is.

22
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.150
Q Anon is an ever-evolving conspiracy theory where the events are happening, uh,

23
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.910
in the past and the present and in the future, it's kind of hilarious.

24
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.430
Every conspiracy theory was at Kennedy, something like that,

25
00:01:22.431 --> 00:01:25.670
that there's a lot of truth in that or all truth. But at the end of the day,

26
00:01:25.671 --> 00:01:27.710
it's like, you're looking back from 30,000 feet,

27
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.540
analyzing little things that have already happened. Cunanan's like,

28
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.180
so I think Alex is kind of like,

29
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.040
I'm a little tired of the constant evolving nature of that conspiracy

30
00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:38.900
theory. So he's.

31
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.450
<v 0>Not a fan of like the jazz that is Q on.</v>

32
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.160
So they're not because they're improvising.

33
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.760
<v 1>Constantly. Alex is like, Hey man, I was on board a little bit.</v>

34
00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:47.630
But at the end of the day,

35
00:01:47.631 --> 00:01:49.970
it's gotten a little annoying because it can turn on you.

36
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.220
Eventually you become part of the conspiracy, right?

37
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.840
Alex is controlled opposition. That's what they'll say. Then surely you could,

38
00:01:56.841 --> 00:02:00.710
because Q Anon is just eats things. So it's a conspiracy that just eats things.

39
00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:03.240
The minute you start to say, Hey man, maybe that's not it.

40
00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:06.350
It just eats you and go, well, you're in on it. Right. Everyone's in on it.

41
00:02:06.351 --> 00:02:10.010
Everyone's just satanic pedophile, everybody, everyone, that questions, it is,

42
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.700
uh, eating children. And you go, wait a minute. That seems illogical.

43
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.670
And but now there's not enough children now. There's not enough.

44
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.950
And I think QA is over now, unfortunately, uh, um, because for these people,

45
00:02:21.951 --> 00:02:24.650
but I think fortunately for them, they're going to have to find a new hobby,

46
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.160
but I think it's over now because even the best Q and on people now are starting

47
00:02:28.161 --> 00:02:30.860
to go, Hey man, this might not be going down the way we thought. Yeah.

48
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.900
But they've literally gone as far as to saying that,

49
00:02:32.901 --> 00:02:34.910
like Biden and Trump's switched faces.

50
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.430
Trump's actually still the president except Biden.

51
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.130
<v 2>You have to be a real moron. Now.</v>

52
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.710
<v 1>You gotta be real stupid. Now it's at the end. Like when it was cool,</v>

53
00:02:45.711 --> 00:02:49.430
like when the FTC stuff happened, Q Anon was like, it was party at cue.

54
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.940
And then when the hunter bite laptop stuff started to happen,

55
00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:55.280
they were like dancing, like it's time.

56
00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.520
And then Biden wins and they're like, wait,

57
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:04.660
whoa. And it's just like, it's the day after the Q Anon.

58
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.660
If you ever went to a party in high school or college Q1 on right now is the day

59
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:10.570
after the party. You wake up, it's, it's 12 noon.

60
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.550
The sun is hitting you in the face. You're hung over.

61
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.820
And there's a statue of disgusting beer and cigarettes all over the house.

62
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:20.410
You're like, what the happened here? I gotta get outta here. I get a bacon, egg,

63
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:24.430
and cheese. That's what Q1 on is. They got to sober up, get out of that house,

64
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:27.630
get a bacon, egg, and cheese and go, man, we were whacked.

65
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.280
We were high dude. I thought Nancy Pelosi was eating children for four years.

66
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.390
And the Donald Trump was going to put her in Guantanamo bay. Wow.

67
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.070
That was because it's interesting that people had to do that after the sixties.

68
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.320
They were like, yeah, I just did a bunch of acid.

69
00:03:43.321 --> 00:03:47.910
And I lived in a ranch in Malibu and everyone I ever saw. And they're like,

70
00:03:47.911 --> 00:03:49.800
I thought that was the way the world was going to go.

71
00:03:49.801 --> 00:03:52.380
And I followed some shaman guy,

72
00:03:52.381 --> 00:03:56.520
some guru who just wanted to me and 10 other people that were living there. And,

73
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.900
uh, we did that for three years.

74
00:03:57.901 --> 00:04:00.840
Apparently we never created the utopia we thought we were going to have.

75
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.000
And now I'm back working here, you know,

76
00:04:03.001 --> 00:04:07.400
at Allstate insurance and we have great policies and we'd love you to come into

77
00:04:07.401 --> 00:04:11.700
the office and we can break them down for you in all ends folks, all the law,

78
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.060
all the ends, but it's fun. They had so much fun.

79
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.280
Q Anon was hard to get mad at because they weren't. This was all they had.

80
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:21.563
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

81
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.600
<v 0>They were quite good at it. And then we're good.</v>

82
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.050
<v 1>And, and, and, and, and, and it was a lot of desperate people,</v>

83
00:04:28.051 --> 00:04:31.980
but there are also rich idiots. There's also like dumb rich people.

84
00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:36.570
And those are like the saddest people in queue, because it's like, they should,

85
00:04:36.571 --> 00:04:40.350
they have the resources to do other things. Yeah. But they just love queue.

86
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.070
They're like, I'm just into this. And I'm like, you're rich,

87
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:45.990
go do something.

88
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.910
How incurious are you go to the Amazon go birdwatching? I don't know.

89
00:04:50.911 --> 00:04:54.330
But there, you know, so playing golf, it's sad, but they're like done now.

90
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.160
I mean, they're there. Oh, it's over.

91
00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.170
<v 0>I'll see. You think this is the, uh.</v>

92
00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:59.280
<v 1>I think everything's ending.</v>

93
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.090
My whole thing is that Trump's out Q1 over quarantine is going to end.

94
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.710
Everything's going to go back to something that's more recognizable.

95
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.150
I think that Matt.

96
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.420
<v 0>Are you optimistic about the 20, 21? I.</v>

97
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.410
<v 1>Agree in certain aspects, I have optimism. And then I have,</v>

98
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.040
I have short-term optimism and long-term pessimism. Okay.

99
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.380
Meaning that I think in the short-term things can get better.

100
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.860
I think long-term because there's so many forces that are out of our control

101
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.270
that are evolving in ways. I barely understand that are carving up society.

102
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.740
It's going to be very tough longterm to be completely optimistic. Like, Hey,

103
00:05:34.741 --> 00:05:37.800
it's going to be great. It's going to be good forever. But short term, I think,

104
00:05:37.801 --> 00:05:40.080
yeah, there's quarantine will end. Things will get better.

105
00:05:40.081 --> 00:05:41.940
The economy will get a little better. Uh,

106
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.860
the constant Trump craziness will die down a little bit. Um, that's my hope.

107
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.760
And people can go back to focusing on things that matter, which is, you know,

108
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.060
the things that are near you and close.

109
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.380
<v 0>Yeah. The humans around you, humans around.</v>

110
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.700
<v 1>You, not Nancy Pelosi. I have my, I have uncles that talk about Nancy plum.</v>

111
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.430
I'm like, you've never met her. Yeah. We'll never meet her shut off. Yeah.

112
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.470
<v 0>And I have a belief that this kind of local love and</v>

113
00:06:08.471 --> 00:06:13.000
kindness that you naturally can have for human beings that you actually know can

114
00:06:13.001 --> 00:06:17.650
be expanded at scale through the social networks that we

115
00:06:17.651 --> 00:06:21.940
use, that we build out. Twitter is currently failing at that miserably.

116
00:06:21.941 --> 00:06:23.770
That would be great, but that's, if we were.

117
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.420
<v 4>Able to increase the love.</v>

118
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.830
<v 1>Through the social networks, that would be great. It feels very hard to,</v>

119
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:31.930
it's a worthy challenge.
