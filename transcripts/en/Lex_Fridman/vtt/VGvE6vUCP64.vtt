00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.290
<v 0>So you mentioned the human condition speaking,</v>

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.410
which you happen to be a human being who's unfortunately

3
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.530
not imortal that seems to be a fundamental part of the

4
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:20.330
human condition that this right ends. Do you think about

5
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.560
the fact that you're going to die one day? Are you afraid of death?

6
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.120
<v 1>Uh, I,</v>

7
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.840
I would say that I am not as much afraid of death as I am

8
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.560
of, um, degeneration. Uh, and, uh,

9
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.910
I say that, uh, in part, for reasons of having,

10
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.830
you know, seen some tragic degenerative situations,

11
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.350
uh, unfold, it's exciting

12
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.350
when you can

13
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.390
continue to participate and, uh,

14
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.300
feel like you're you're are near the, the place where the,

15
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.780
the wave is breaking on the shore, if you like, you know? Um, and,

16
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.380
and I, I, I think about, you know,

17
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.940
my own, uh, future potential, um, if,

18
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.610
if I were to undergo a, uh, begin to suffer from dementia,

19
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.250
uh, Alzheimer's disease or semantic dementia, or some other condition,

20
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.210
you know, I would sort of gradually lose the thread of that ability. And,

21
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.010
um, uh, so, so one can live on for several,

22
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.240
for a decade eight after, you know,

23
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.280
sort of having to retire because one no longer has,

24
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.160
uh, these kinds of, um, abilities to engage. And, uh,

25
00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.480
I think that's the thing that I feared the most.

26
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.200
<v 0>The losing of that, like the, that, that, um, the,</v>

27
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.230
the breaking of the way, the floor flourishing of the mind where you,

28
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.790
you have these ideas and they're swimming around, you're able to play with them.

29
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.590
Yeah.

30
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.270
<v 1>And, and, and, and, and collaborate with other people who, you know,</v>

31
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.430
are themselves, uh, um,

32
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.070
really helping to push these ideas forward. So, yeah.

33
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.580
<v 0>What about the edge of the cliff? Yeah, and I mean, the,</v>

34
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.460
the mystery of it, the, the, I mean.

35
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.500
<v 1>The migrated con sort of conception of mind and, you know,</v>

36
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.540
sort of continuous sort of way of thinking about most things makes it, so that,

37
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.260
uh, to, to me, the, the, the, um,

38
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.090
the discreetness of that transition of is less, &lt;laugh&gt; less, less,

39
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.530
less apparent than it seems to be to most people. I see.

40
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.850
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; I see. Yeah. Um, yeah, I wonder,</v>

41
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.160
so I don't know if you know the work of Ernest Becker and so on. I wonder what,

42
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.070
what role,

43
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.840
mortality and our ability to be cognizant of it and

44
00:03:06.841 --> 00:03:11.280
anticipate it, and perhaps be afraid of it, what role that plays in, in our

45
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:13.920
reasoning of the world.

46
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.720
<v 1>I think that it,</v>

47
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.070
it can be motivating to people to think they have a li emitted period left. Um,

48
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.390
I think in, in my own case, you know, it it's like seven or eight years ago.

49
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.283
Now that I was,

50
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.270
I was sitting around doing experiments on

51
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.510
decision making that were, um,

52
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.550
satisfying in a certain way,

53
00:03:37.551 --> 00:03:41.740
because I could really get closure on what,

54
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.340
whether the model fit the data perfectly or not.

55
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.380
And I could see how one could test, you know,

56
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.060
the predictions in monkeys as well as humans,

57
00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.060
and really see what the neurons were doing. But I just realized,

58
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.530
Hey, wait a minute. You know, I may only have about 10 or 15 years left here.

59
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.330
And I don't feel like I'm getting towards the answers to the really interesting

60
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.090
questions while I'm doing this, this particular level of work.

61
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.090
And that's when I said to myself, okay, um,

62
00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.850
let's pick something that's hard. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. You know,

63
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.440
so that's when I started working on mathematical cognition mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;

64
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.040
and, um, I, I, I think it was more in terms of, well,

65
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.280
I got 15 more years possibly of useful life left.

66
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.960
Let's imagine that it's only 10.

67
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.440
I I'm actually getting close to the end of that now,

68
00:04:36.441 --> 00:04:40.480
maybe three or four more years. Um, but I'm beginning to feel like, well,

69
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.190
I probably have another five after that, so, okay. I'll give myself another,

70
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.910
another six or eight. Um, but a.

71
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.270
<v 0>Deadline is looming and.</v>

72
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.550
<v 1>Therefore, but I, this gonna go in forever. Yeah. And so, um, so, uh, yeah,</v>

73
00:04:53.551 --> 00:04:54.790
I gotta keep, um,

74
00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:57.750
thinking about the questions that I think are the interesting and important ones

75
00:04:57.751 --> 00:04:58.150
for sure.
