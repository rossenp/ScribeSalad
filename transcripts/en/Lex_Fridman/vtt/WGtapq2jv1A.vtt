00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.640
<v 0>I've been reading a lot about military history recently.</v>

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.540
And one way to paint the picture of browsers,

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.440
internet browsers is through the various wars throughout its history.

4
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.510
I don't know if that's a useful way to look at it,

5
00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:20.070
but we've already talked a little bit about Netscape and, and I'd explore, uh,

6
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.180
in the early days.

7
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.710
Can you tell the story of the different wars if that's at all an interesting way

8
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:29.960
to look at it of the nineties and to today? Yeah.

9
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.320
<v 1>So I mentioned that Microsoft, you know, which was convicted at four,</v>

10
00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:34.700
it did abuse its monopoly,

11
00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:39.140
but they had a pretty good team by the time they did it for and Netscape.

12
00:00:39.141 --> 00:00:39.980
Unfortunately,

13
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.710
I was like the second floor and I was friends with all the first floor people,

14
00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:46.640
the front end guys who did the JavaScript event, hookup and things like that.

15
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.370
Um, that that team was fairly burnt out. And I think, uh,

16
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.190
having gone public, uh, the man upper management,

17
00:00:55.191 --> 00:00:58.130
wanted to buy a bunch of companies to try to go head to head with Microsoft

18
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.270
didn't work, but buying a bunch of companies usually doesn't work.

19
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.100
I think the modern sort of approach it roughly is like mark Zuckerberg,

20
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.970
uh, took, which is to keep them at arms length and let them do their thing.

21
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.020
And now that he's pulling WhatsApp in and people are fleeing it because it's

22
00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:18.860
tied into the ad surveillance. But, um, you know,

23
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.150
for awhile they're keeping it separate,

24
00:01:20.151 --> 00:01:22.190
really does work because you bought it for its value.

25
00:01:22.191 --> 00:01:25.550
It's complimentary and you're not messing with it with Netscape.

26
00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:26.750
When they bought a bunch of companies,

27
00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:31.130
they had some of the first four people or the founders burned out. They had, um,

28
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.510
newcomers who wanted their turn to do the browser and they hadn't really

29
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.370
done browsers or understood them.

30
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.180
And so Netscape four was originally supposed to be three and it was so late.

31
00:01:41.181 --> 00:01:42.000
They renumbered it.

32
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.190
We did a three release Jamie and a few others put some extra effort into a

33
00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:50.660
secure mine was supported in the mail, a built in mail program.

34
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.950
Um, and that's K four was late and it was only on windows at first.

35
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.180
And Microsoft had really started doing better. Like they do, they copy.

36
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.160
And the first version is trash. And the second one,

37
00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:02.870
you're starting to feel a little threatened. The third one,

38
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.180
you can tell what's going to happen in the fourth. One's.

39
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.800
<v 0>Good. And plus, there's the benefit of,</v>

40
00:02:06.801 --> 00:02:09.380
like you said that it comes as a default browser. Yeah.

41
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.041
<v 1>And,</v>

42
00:02:10.041 --> 00:02:14.630
and yet Netscape screwing it up and Microsoft really putting some quality people

43
00:02:14.631 --> 00:02:17.330
on it. I, four was good on windows. It was good.

44
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.190
And they did the dynamic HTML innovations, the, uh, Scott Isaac's,

45
00:02:22.191 --> 00:02:22.910
my old buddy,

46
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.800
a former accountant who programmed in basic and became what the Microsoft calls

47
00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:31.370
a program manager, which is kind of an elevated position. It's, um,

48
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.710
you can be a program or an engineer track,

49
00:02:33.711 --> 00:02:37.160
but you switched to it and you sort of lead a lot of design and standards

50
00:02:37.161 --> 00:02:40.520
efforts. And so Scott has put in a lot of those, uh,

51
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.050
funky D HTML API APIs that didn't quite have the same flavor as the stuff that I

52
00:02:45.051 --> 00:02:49.580
did. And neither of them was like the later sort of verbose Java, like Tom,

53
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.720
let me three C standardized, but I for it was pretty darn good. We,

54
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.950
I remember a friend Scott Fermin, and I got invited by Scott Isaacs to, uh,

55
00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.650
Gordon beers in San Jose.

56
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.470
They were doing a preview of [inaudible]. This must have been 1997. And Scott 

57
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.470
says, yeah, we've got, here's the new graphics

58
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.470
 stuff we're doing. We've got something like your Netscape layers. Um,

59
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.470
 we've got VML, vector, markup language, you know, we can do like virtual reality. And Scott and I looked 

60
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.470
at each other and said, we're doomed, right

61
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.470
. Microsoft was starting to fire on all cylinders. So I have to give them

62
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.470
 credit for that, even though they abused their market power. And

63
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.470
 maybe I shouldn't give him credit for having the resource

64
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.470
 to hire talented people, but they did a credible job on I four

65
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.470
. What really was bad was that phase of the browser wars ended with monopoly and perhaps due to the 

66
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.470
anti-trust case, perhaps due to regulation Europe, um,

67
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.470
 perhaps just due to Microsoft, not liking, dealing with standardization, they w they let it rot. They just abandoned it. I 5, 5, 5

68
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.470
, um,

69
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.303
I six later, but these were not well-maintained. They had a lot of security bugs.

70
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.260
<v 0>Browse really closed and outdated too, even though it's getting updated,</v>

71
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.190
it's just weird.

72
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.190
<v 1>Browsers, like Mozilla and Firefox. We're adding tabs.</v>

73
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.190
Opera had a version of tabs and, uh,

74
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.580
they didn't add tabs and they pop up blocking something I should have done from

75
00:04:11.581 --> 00:04:12.031
the start.

76
00:04:12.031 --> 00:04:15.330
People realize that you can tell when the user clicks something and it goes to

77
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.530
in JavaScript to open a little window that you can sort of inspect the stack and

78
00:04:19.531 --> 00:04:22.350
see that the click originated that. And that's probably okay.

79
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.350
Whereas if you're just loading a script and it opens a new window,

80
00:04:25.351 --> 00:04:27.750
that's a spam technique and you should block.

81
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.950
<v 0>It. Tabs were brilliant innovation, like you said, opera had it. But like,</v>

82
00:04:31.951 --> 00:04:35.910
I remember I fully switched to Firefox the moment it was.

83
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.710
I remember like the moments of first using tabs and Firefox and like

84
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.000
not liking it, like for the first few minutes. And then like, wait a minute.

85
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.160
<v 1>You get the groove. Yeah. You get the groove.</v>

86
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.110
<v 0>And you understand mean, so that timing, w what year was this? Uh, because,</v>

87
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.520
uh, also as a aspiring web designer, I use table.

88
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.950
So we would have mentioned layout or CSS points.

89
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.990
There's also a change in the way, like the frames were going away. Yeah.

90
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.070
So there's a change in the way websites looked and behavior and all that kind of

91
00:05:08.071 --> 00:05:08.904
stuff.

92
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.750
<v 1>Finally, which Microsoft embraced with IFR and Netscape, and there really did,</v>

93
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.880
right. Uh,

94
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.150
CSS became a better standard over time for doing table layout that

95
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.130
relieved you of the need to use what are called spacer gifts, spacer gifts,

96
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.590
right. Images you would throw into space up tables. Um, you know, the,

97
00:05:27.591 --> 00:05:30.630
the type of graphic power of the web has gotten better,

98
00:05:30.631 --> 00:05:34.320
but it's still not on the level of PDF and you can't do advanced typography,

99
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.920
but, um, it's gotten really better. And even then tables were getting better.

100
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.440
If you were using Firefox, that would have been 2004,

101
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.490
because it was called Firebird until really that, you know, I think, uh,

102
00:05:44.491 --> 00:05:45.600
it wasn't 12, three.

103
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.600
<v 0>I don't remember. It was a fiber which had tabs.</v>

104
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.870
<v 1>Yeah. We had tabs the whole way. So it was the less,</v>

105
00:05:51.871 --> 00:05:54.630
less browser it became in 2002, became Phoenix.

106
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.310
There's a bios that has an embedded of IIE. And they said,

107
00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:01.460
we're called Phoenix technologies. You can't use Phoenix. And so we said, okay,

108
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:02.360
we'll call it Firebird.

109
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:07.280
And then this Australian centered open source database project started really

110
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.290
like in the true Madmax stout,

111
00:06:09.291 --> 00:06:11.540
just screaming at us saying you can't use Firebird.

112
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:14.000
And I had to sort of be the ambassador. And I said, okay,

113
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:16.130
we're going to rename it. We don't believe ideation. They used that.

114
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:20.000
We hate you. And then we renamed it to Firefox. And they're like, ah,

115
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.940
we love you. And then I don't, haven't heard of them ever since,

116
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.810
but Firefox was a clever name. We had to think of something distinctive.

117
00:06:26.811 --> 00:06:31.340
We wanted to keep the fire going. And it turns out there's a red Panda, right.

118
00:06:31.341 --> 00:06:32.240
It's a nickname for.
