00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.640
<v 0>There's kind of a pushback in Silicon valley, a little bit against hard work.</v>

2
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.430
Can you speak to the sort of the thing you admire to see the new guy

3
00:00:12.431 --> 00:00:16.360
working so hard, that thing, what is the value of that thing in a company?

4
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.830
<v 1>And see, this is like, just to be very Frank, it drives me nuts.</v>

5
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.810
Like I saw this really funny video in Tech-Talk was on tech talk.

6
00:00:25.811 --> 00:00:29.140
It was like, I'm taking a break from my mental health to work on my career,

7
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.700
but that was funny. Um, yeah, so there's like, oh,

8
00:00:33.701 --> 00:00:36.940
it is kind of phrased that way. The opposite often. Right. Um, okay.

9
00:00:36.941 --> 00:00:41.290
So a couple of things, uh, I,

10
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.940
uh,

11
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.860
I have worked so hard to do the things that I did like Mike

12
00:00:47.861 --> 00:00:52.840
and I lost years of our lives, staying up late, figuring things out,

13
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.850
the stress that comes with the job.

14
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.280
I have a lot more gray hair now than I did back then.

15
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.590
It requires an enormous amount of work and most people aren't successful. Right.

16
00:01:02.591 --> 00:01:05.830
But even the ones that do don't skate by, um,

17
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.560
I am okay if people choose not to work hard because I don't actually think

18
00:01:11.561 --> 00:01:14.980
there's anything in this world that says you have to work hard. Um,

19
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.510
but I do think that great things require a lot of hard work.

20
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.630
So there's no way you can expect to change the world without working really

21
00:01:22.631 --> 00:01:26.020
hard. And by the way, even changing the world, you know,

22
00:01:26.021 --> 00:01:29.140
the folks that I respect the most have nudged the world in like a slight

23
00:01:29.141 --> 00:01:32.530
direction, slight, very, very slight,

24
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.110
like even if Elan accomplishes all the things he wants to accomplish,

25
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.440
we will have, uh, have nudged the world in a slight direction,

26
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.260
but it requires enormous amount.

27
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.110
There was an interview with him where he was just like, he was interviewed,

28
00:01:47.111 --> 00:01:50.680
I think, at the Tesla factory. And he was like, work is really hard.

29
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.130
This is actually unhealthy. And I can't recall the exact,

30
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.400
but he was like visibly shaken about how hard he had been working.

31
00:01:57.401 --> 00:02:00.820
And he was like, this is bad. And unfortunately I think to have great outcomes,

32
00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:04.480
you actually do need to work at like three standard deviations above the mean,

33
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.550
but there's nothing saying that people have.

34
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.560
<v 0>Yeah, the thing is, but what I would argue,</v>

35
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.100
this is my personal opinion is nobody has to do anything. First of all.

36
00:02:13.101 --> 00:02:15.050
And second, they certainly don't have to work hard,

37
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.450
but I think hard work in a company

38
00:02:20.451 --> 00:02:21.710
should be admired.

39
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.060
<v 1>I do too.</v>

40
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.970
<v 0>And you should not feel like</v>

41
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.640
you shouldn't feel good about yourself for not working hard.

42
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.070
Like it's just, so for example, I don't have to work out. I don't have to run,

43
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.800
I hate running, but like,

44
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.070
I certainly don't feel good if I don't run because I know for my health,

45
00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:45.830
like there's certain values, I guess, is what I'm trying to get. Right.

46
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.720
There's certain values of the oven life.

47
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.900
It feels like there's certain values that companies should have and hard work is

48
00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:54.530
one of the things. Um, I th I think that should be admired.

49
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.550
I often ask this kind of silly question, uh, just, just to get a sense of when,

50
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.160
like,

51
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.780
if I'm hiring and so on and just ask if they think it's better to work hard or

52
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:09.730
work smart, it was helpful for me to get a sense of people from that,

53
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.130
that, cause you think like the right both.

54
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:13.090
<v 1>Was.</v>

55
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.720
<v 0>That the answers, the answer is both. I usually try not to give them that,</v>

56
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.720
but sometimes I'll say both if that's an option,

57
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.880
but a lot of people kind of a surprising number will say work smart.

58
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.840
And they're usually people who don't know how to work smart.

59
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.030
And, uh, they're, they're literally just lazy and not just as there's two,

60
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.400
there's two effects behind that is one is laziness.

61
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.620
And the other is ego just when you're younger and you

62
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:45.940
say it's better to work smart. It means you think,

63
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.440
you know what it means to work smart at this early stage. To me,

64
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.910
people that say work hard or are both, they have the humility to understand,

65
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:59.290
like I'm going to have to work my off because I'm too dumb to know how to work

66
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:03.340
smart and people who are self-critical in this way. In some small amount,

67
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.030
you have to have some confidence, but you have, if you have humility,

68
00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:10.270
that means you're going to actually eventually figure out what it means to work

69
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:13.570
smart. And then to actually be successful, you should do the book.

70
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.490
<v 1>So I have a very particular take on this, which is that, um,</v>

71
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.940
no one's forcing you to do anything. All choices have consequences.

72
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.780
So if you major in, I don't know,

73
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.050
theoretical literature, I don't even know if that's a major,

74
00:04:32.051 --> 00:04:33.070
I'm just making something up.

75
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.600
<v 0>That's supposed to regular literature.</v>

76
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.750
<v 1>Literature to think about like,</v>

77
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.580
like theoretical Spanish lit from the 14th century,

78
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.560
like just make, make up your esoteric thing.

79
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.440
And then the number of people I went to Stanford with,

80
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.440
who get out in the world and I'm like, wait, what? I can't find a job.

81
00:04:50.441 --> 00:04:52.150
Like no one wants a theoretical.

82
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.260
Like there are plenty of counterexamples of people who have majored in esoteric

83
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.930
things and gone on to be very successful. So I just want to be clear.

84
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:03.820
It's not about the major, but every choice you make, whether it's to have kids,

85
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.750
like, I love my children. It's so awesome to have two kids.

86
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.220
And it is so hard to work really hard. And also have kids is really hard.

87
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.200
And there's a reason why certain very successful people like don't have are not

88
00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:18.700
successful, but people who run very,

89
00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:22.450
very large companies of startups have chosen not to have kids for awhile or

90
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.020
choose not to like prioritize them. Everything's a choice. And like,

91
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.520
I choose to prioritize my children because I want to do that. Right.

92
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.890
So everything's a choice. Now, once you've made that choice,

93
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.060
I think it's important that the contract is clear, which is to say,

94
00:05:40.061 --> 00:05:41.920
let's imagine you were joining a new startup.

95
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.890
It's important that that startup communicate that like the expectation is like,

96
00:05:47.891 --> 00:05:49.570
we're all working really, really hard right now.

97
00:05:49.571 --> 00:05:53.530
You don't have to join this startup. But like, if you do just know,

98
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.860
like you're S it's almost as if you join, I don't know, pick your, uh,

99
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.400
pick your, pick your like sports team. Like,

100
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.030
let's go back to the Yankees for a second. You want to join the Yankees,

101
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.800
but you don't really want to work that hard.

102
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:10.160
You don't really want to do batting practice or pitching practice or whatever

103
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.170
for your position. Right. Um,

104
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.090
that to me is wacko and that's actually the world that it feels like we live in

105
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:20.210
and tech sometimes where people both want to work for the Yankees.

106
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:21.950
Cause that pays a lot, but like,

107
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:26.360
don't actually want to work that hard that I don't fully understand,

108
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.020
because if you sign up for some of these things, just sign up for it,

109
00:06:30.021 --> 00:06:31.820
but it's okay if you don't want to sign up for it.

110
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.770
There's so many wonderful careers in this world that don't require 80 hours a

111
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:36.951
week.

112
00:06:36.951 --> 00:06:39.650
But when I read about companies going to like four day work weeks and stuff,

113
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.090
I just like, I chuckled because I can't get enough done with a seven day week.

114
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.080
I don't know how, and people will say, oh, you're just not working smart.

115
00:06:48.081 --> 00:06:51.170
And it's like, no, I, I work pretty smart. I think in general, like I,

116
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.650
I wouldn't have gotten to this point if I hadn't like some amount of working

117
00:06:54.651 --> 00:06:59.060
smart. And there is balance though. So I used to be like a pretty big cyclist.

118
00:06:59.061 --> 00:07:02.510
I don't do it much anymore just because of kids and like prioritizing other

119
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:03.344
things. Right.

120
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.150
But one of the most important things to learn as a cyclist is to take a rest

121
00:07:08.151 --> 00:07:10.790
day. But to me, and to cyclists,

122
00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:15.140
like resting is a function of optimizing for the long run.

123
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.240
It's not like a thing that you do for its own merits. It's actually like,

124
00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:23.240
if you don't rest your muscles, don't recover. And then you're just not as like,

125
00:07:23.241 --> 00:07:24.680
you're not training as efficiently.

126
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.670
<v 0>Probably the, the successful people I've known in terms of athletes.</v>

127
00:07:28.671 --> 00:07:32.060
They hate rest days, but they know they have to do it for the long-term.

128
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.410
They think their opposition is getting stronger and stronger in that that's the,

129
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.050
the feeling, but, you know, it's the right thing.

130
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.760
And usually you need a coach to help you.

131
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.770
<v 1>Yeah, totally. So, I mean,</v>

132
00:07:42.771 --> 00:07:45.740
I use this thing called training peaks and it's interesting because it actually

133
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.220
mathematically shows like where you are on the curve and all this stuff,

134
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.550
but you have to re like you have to have that rest,

135
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:55.730
but it it's a function of going harder for longer. Again,

136
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.450
it's this reinforcement learning, like planning the aggregate and along,

137
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.840
but a lot of people will hide behind laziness by saying that they're trying to

138
00:08:02.841 --> 00:08:05.990
optimize for the long run. And they're not, they're just not working very hard,

139
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.930
but again, you don't have to sign up for it. It's totally cool. Like,

140
00:08:08.931 --> 00:08:12.440
I don't think less of people for like, not working super hard. It's just like,

141
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:14.930
don't sign up for things that require working super hard.

142
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.170
<v 0>And some of that requires for the leadership to have the guts,</v>

143
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.290
the boldness to communicate effectively at the very beginning. I mean,

144
00:08:21.291 --> 00:08:26.090
sometimes I think most of the problems arise in the fact that the leadership has

145
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:31.010
kind of hesitant to, to communicate the, this the socially,

146
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:36.740
um, difficult truth of what it takes to be at this company.

147
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:41.300
So they kind of say, Hey, come, come with us. There's west snacks, you know,

148
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:42.800
but.

149
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.110
<v 1>Limited vacation. And, you know, uh,</v>

150
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.020
Ray at Bridgewater is always fascinating because, you know,

151
00:08:48.021 --> 00:08:52.250
people it's been called like a cult on the outside or cultish. And,

152
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.950
but what's fascinating is like, they just don't on their principles.

153
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.350
They're like, listen, this is what it's like to work here.

154
00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.880
We record every meeting.

155
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.870
We're like brutally honest and that's not going to feel right to everyone.

156
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.800
And if it doesn't feel Reggie, totally cool. Just go work somewhere else.

157
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:12.330
But if you work here, you are signing up for this. And that's,

158
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.120
that's been fascinating to me because it's honesty upfront.
