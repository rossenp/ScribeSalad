WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.470
<v 0>And, uh, I mean, as Eric talks about, uh, on the science side of things, I mean,</v>

2
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.870
I said, uh, like at MIT, especially in the machine learning field,

3
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.910
there's a natural institutional resistance to the weird it's very,

4
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.030
as they talk about it's, it's, it's difficult to hire weird faculty,

5
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.430
for example, correct. You want to hire,

6
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.540
you want to hire and give tenure to people that are safe. Uh, not weird.

7
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.900
And that's one of the concerns is like,

8
00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:32.740
it seems like the weird people are the ones that push the science forward

9
00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:36.820
usually. Right. And so like, how do you, how do you balance the two?

10
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.500
It's not obvious because it's, it's.

11
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.060
<v 1>Another area where Eric and I disagree as I interpret him,</v>

12
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:44.530
he thinks academia is totally bankrupt. Yeah.

13
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.970
And I think it's only partially bankrupt. &lt;laugh&gt;.

14
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.690
<v 0>How do we fix it? Cause I I'm I'm with you, I'm opt I'm bullish in academia.</v>

15
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.490
<v 1>You need up and coming schools that end up better than where they started off.</v>

16
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.890
And MIT was once one of them. Yes.

17
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.890
Now they're not in every area and some areas they have become the problem. Yep.

18
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.400
You Chicago. Oh, you wouldn't call it up and coming,

19
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.160
but it's still different and that's great.

20
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.360
Let's hope they manage to keep it that way. Uh,

21
00:01:11.361 --> 00:01:14.240
the biggest problem to me is the rank absurd.

22
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.360
Conformism at kind of second tier schools, maybe in the top 40,

23
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.560
but not in the top dozen that are just trying to be like a junior MIT mm-hmm

24
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.480
&lt;affirmative&gt;, but it's mediocre and copycat.

25
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.270
And they're the most dogmatic enforcers of weirdness that like Harvard is more

26
00:01:29.271 --> 00:01:30.990
open than those second tier schools.

27
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.150
And those second tier schools are pretty good typically. Right?

28
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.870
<v 0>Yeah. But the mediocrity enforced there, correct.</v>

29
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.213
<v 1>Very strictly.</v>

30
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.750
And the homogenization pressures try climb their rankings by another three

31
00:01:43.751 --> 00:01:46.300
places. Yeah. And be able to little closer to MIT though.

32
00:01:46.301 --> 00:01:49.620
You'll never touch them. Yeah. That to me is very harmful and you'd rather,

33
00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:50.980
they be more like Chicago,

34
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.540
more like Caltech or the older Caltech all the more like pick some model,

35
00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.020
be weird in it. You might fail that's socially better.

36
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.940
<v 0>Yeah. But so the problem with MIT, for example,</v>

37
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.810
is the mediocrity is really enforced on the junior

38
00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:09.730
faculty. Yeah.

39
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.970
So like the people that are allowed to be weird or actually they just don't even

40
00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:17.850
ask for permissions anymore are more senior faculty. And that's good of course,

41
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.210
but you want the weird young people, uh, you know,

42
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.050
I find too, you know, this podcast,

43
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.720
I like talking to tech people and I find the young faculty to be really boring.

44
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.600
<v 1>They are, they're the most boring of faculty. Their.</v>

45
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.480
<v 0>Work is interesting, technically technically, but just the,</v>

46
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.520
the, the passion they.

47
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.840
<v 1>Are drudges &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

48
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.800
<v 0>And it's, well, some of them sneak by like, you have like the max tag,</v>

49
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.440
Mark Young version of max Techmark,

50
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.030
who knows how to play the role &lt;laugh&gt; of boring and,

51
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.110
and fitting in. And then on, on the side he does the weird. Uh, but they're not,

52
00:02:56.111 --> 00:02:58.550
they're far and few in between, which I,

53
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.080
I I'd love to figure out a way to shake up that system because.

54
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.080
<v 1>I, you look at MIT's broad Institute, right. In biomedical,</v>

55
00:03:06.081 --> 00:03:09.320
it's been a huge hit. Yeah. I'm not privy to their internal doings,

56
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.560
but I suspect they support weird more than the formal departments do at

57
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:16.160
the junior level. Yes. That's.

58
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.590
<v 0>Probably true. Yeah. I don't know what, whatever they're doing, it's working,</v>

59
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.790
but, uh, it needs to figure it out.

60
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.630
Cause I think the best ideas still do come from the, uh,

61
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.190
so forget my apologies. But for the humanity side of things, I don't,

62
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.750
I don't know anything about, but the engineering and the science side, I,

63
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.860
I think there's so many amazing ideas that are still coming from universities.

64
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.300
<v 1>It's not true that you don't know anything about the humanities.</v>

65
00:03:42.301 --> 00:03:45.500
You're doing the humanities right now. Well, we're talking about people.

66
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.260
There are no numbers put on a Blackboard, right? Yeah.

67
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.260
There's no hypothesis testing per se. No. Yeah, that's fine.

68
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.260
You have however many subscribers to your podcast,

69
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.980
all listening to you on the humanities, every whatever your frequency is ever,

70
00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.220
but.

71
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.410
<v 0>I'm not in the department of the humanities. That's why it's innovative.</v>

72
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.490
They have very different conversations.

73
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.290
There's the number of emails I get about. Listen, I,

74
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.610
I really deeply respect diversity at the, and the, the,

75
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.330
the full scope of what diversity means,

76
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.450
and also the more narrow scope of different races and genders and so on.

77
00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:20.640
It's a really important topic,

78
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.240
but there's a disproportionate number of emails I'm getting, uh,

79
00:04:24.241 --> 00:04:28.520
about meetings and discussions. And that, that just kind is overwhelming.

80
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.120
I don't get enough emails from people like a meeting about, uh,

81
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.560
why are all your ideas bad? Let's let's, uh, for example,

82
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.350
let me call out MIT. Why don't we do more, uh,

83
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.230
why don't we kick Stanford's or Google's more importantly in deep learning and

84
00:04:46.231 --> 00:04:50.150
machine learning and AI research. What, uh, Cun, for example,

85
00:04:50.151 --> 00:04:54.630
used to be a laboratory is a laboratory for artificial intelligence research.

86
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.950
And why is that? Not the,

87
00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.820
the beacon of what of greatness in

88
00:05:02.821 --> 00:05:05.340
artificial intelligence let's have those meetings as well.

89
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.380
<v 1>Diversity talk has oddly become this new mechanism for enforcing conformity.</v>

90
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.520
Yes, exactly.

91
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.353
<v 0>And right.</v>

92
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.580
So it's almost like this conformity mechanism finds the hot new topic to use,

93
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.460
to enforce further conformity. Exactly. Uh, boy,

94
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.730
I still of hope I remain optimistic. Uh, but.

95
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.770
<v 1>The humanities have innovated through podcasts, including yours and mines. Yeah.</v>

96
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:28.810
And they're alive and well,

97
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.650
all the bad talk you hear about the humanities in universities,

98
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.010
there's been of this huge end run of innovation on the internet. Yeah.

99
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.290
<v 0>And it's amazing. You're right. I ne never thought, I mean, this is humanities,</v>

100
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.960
&lt;laugh&gt; this, this.

101
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.200
<v 1>Podcast, right. Not been speaking pros all once life and didn't know it. Right.</v>

102
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.390
Uh.

103
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.800
<v 0>Yeah. I am actually part of the humanities department and MIT.</v>

104
00:05:51.801 --> 00:05:54.040
Now I didn't did not realize this and I,

105
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.040
I will fully embrace it from this moment on.

106
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.880
<v 1>Look, you have this thing, the media lab, I'm sure you know about it,</v>

107
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.880
done some excellent things, done a lot of very bogus things.

108
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.600
<v 0>But you're out competing them. You're blowing them out of the water. Yeah.</v>

109
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.320
Like you are them. Yeah.

110
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.680
And I'm talking to those folks and they they're trying to, well, uh,

111
00:06:10.681 --> 00:06:11.920
they're trying to figure it out. I mean,

112
00:06:11.921 --> 00:06:16.440
they had their issues with Jeffrey Epstein and so on. But outside of that,

113
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.230
there's a, I actually gone through a shift with this particular podcast,

114
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.243
for example,

115
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.790
where at first it was seen as a one,

116
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.870
the very first it was seen as a distraction. Second, it was a source of like,

117
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.670
almost like a kind of jealousy,

118
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.900
like the same kind of jealousy you feel when junior faculty shines the senior

119
00:06:37.901 --> 00:06:42.900
faculty. Of course. And now it's more like, oh, okay, this is a thing like, we,

120
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.180
we should do more of that. We should embrace this guy.

121
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.540
We should embrace this thing.

122
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.740
So there there's a sense that podcasting and whatever this is,

123
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.660
and it doesn't have to podcasting will drive some innovation within MIT,

124
00:06:55.661 --> 00:06:59.170
within different universities. There's a sense that things are changing.

125
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.610
It's just that universities lag behind. And my hope is that,

126
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.010
you know, they catch up quickly. They, they, they,

127
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.250
they innovate in some way that goes along with the innovations of the internet.

128
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.170
<v 1>Online. I think the internet will outrace them for a long time. Maybe forever.</v>

129
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.320
<v 0>Well, I mean, but it's okay if they're as long, long as.</v>

130
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.360
<v 1>They're keeping. Yeah. And we're both in universities.</v>

131
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.880
So we have multiple hats on here as we're speaking.

132
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.520
So we can complain about the universities,

133
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.360
but that's like complaining about the podcasters, right.
