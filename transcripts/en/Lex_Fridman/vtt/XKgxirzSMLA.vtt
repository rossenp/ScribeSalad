00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.770
<v 0>You know, the choice is to strap yourself to a rocket ship or to build your own,</v>

2
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.050
you know, Mr. Elon built his own, literally with the rocket ship.

3
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.170
That's a difficult choice because, um, there's a world.

4
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.290
<v 1>Actually. I would say something different,</v>

5
00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:22.970
which is Elon and others decided to sell PayPal for I,

6
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.280
not that much. I mean, how much was it about a billion dollars?

7
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.360
I can't remember something like that. Yeah. I mean, it was early and, um,

8
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.640
but it's worth a lot more now, right. To then build the new rocket ships.

9
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.920
So this is the cool part, right?

10
00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:37.600
<v 2>Yeah. If you are an entrepreneur and you own a controlling stake in the company,</v>

11
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.920
not only is it really hard to do something else with your life because all of

12
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.190
the, you know,

13
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.590
value is tied up in you as a personality attached to this company. Right.

14
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.190
But if you sell it and you get yourself enough capital and you like have enough

15
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.310
energy, you could do another thing or 10 other things or an Elon's case,

16
00:00:57.311 --> 00:00:58.270
like a bunch of other things.

17
00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.910
<v 1>Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I don't know. Like I lost count at this point.</v>

18
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.860
Um &lt;laugh&gt; and it might have seemed silly at the time. Sure.

19
00:01:04.861 --> 00:01:09.580
Like if you look back, man, PayPal's worth a lot now. Right. But I don't know.

20
00:01:09.581 --> 00:01:12.060
Like, do you think Elon like cares about like,

21
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.260
are we gonna buy Pinterest or not? Like, I just, he is, he created a,

22
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.380
a, a, a massive capital that allowed him to do what he wants to do.

23
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.400
And that's awesome.

24
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.690
That's more freeing than anything because when you are an entrepreneur attached

25
00:01:25.691 --> 00:01:29.050
to a company, you gotta stay at the company for a really long time.

26
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.130
It's really hard to remove yourself.

27
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.170
<v 0>But I'm not sure how much you loved PayPal versus SpaceX and Tesla.</v>

28
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.290
I have a sense that you love.

29
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.370
<v 1>Instagram. Yeah. I loved enough to like work for six years beyond the detail,</v>

30
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.810
which is.

31
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.760
<v 0>Rare, which is very rare you chose.</v>

32
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.760
<v 1>But can I tell you why? Sure. It's um, please,</v>

33
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.880
there are not a lot of companies that you can be part of where

34
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.520
the popes, like, I would like to sign up for your product.

35
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.480
Like I'm not a religious person at all. I'm really not. Um, yeah,

36
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.480
but when you go to the Vatican and you're like walking among the giant columns,

37
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.910
hearing the music and everything,

38
00:02:06.911 --> 00:02:10.790
and like the Pope walks in and he wants to press the signup button on your

39
00:02:10.791 --> 00:02:15.350
product. Like it's a moment in life. Okay. Um, no matter what your persuasion,

40
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.350
okay. The number of doors and experiences that,

41
00:02:20.351 --> 00:02:23.630
that opened up was it was incredible. I mean, the people I got to meet,

42
00:02:23.631 --> 00:02:25.830
the places I got to go, um,

43
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.980
I assume maybe like a payments company is slightly different. Right.

44
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.020
But that's why, like, it was so fun.

45
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.700
And plus I truly believed we were building such a great product and I loved,

46
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.140
loved the game. It wasn't about a money. It was about the game. I.
