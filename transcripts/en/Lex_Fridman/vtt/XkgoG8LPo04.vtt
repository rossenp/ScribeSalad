1
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.350
<v 0>You know, thinking about digital currency in general, like digital finance,</v>

2
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:08.930
it's a,

3
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.790
one of the big transitions transformations of our world.

4
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.270
In some sense, it's not just about money,

5
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.510
or you could argue that money is everything. I mean, it's like money,

6
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.950
isn't just the, the, the narrow definition,

7
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.340
your money money is really everything. And so we're,

8
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.300
you could argue that sort of, uh,

9
00:00:27.301 --> 00:00:32.140
cryptocurrency is like the base layer of this transformation

10
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.100
to the digital space and everything else would just be built on top of it.

11
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.180
<v 1>I use a different word, um, that I think is kind of closer to your, uh, world,</v>

12
00:00:41.181 --> 00:00:46.010
which is it's ultimately automation. And what I mean by that is, uh,

13
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.650
you know, before 1970 or 1980, all the assets were analog.

14
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.170
And so when you have analog assets, physical stock certificates, physical bonds,

15
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.290
right? Physical de do a home, uh, yet to physically exchange them. Yeah.

16
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.770
When we wanted to increase transactions and increase kind of

17
00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:05.360
global will finance and access,

18
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.040
we took those physical assets and we created electronic QIP assets.

19
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.640
So now we have in centralized databases, kind of a file represents the asset.

20
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.240
That's sitting somewhere in custody and you and I can transact them a little bit

21
00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:20.600
easier, but still centralized. There's still some bureaucracy. And, and, uh,

22
00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:20.801
you know,

23
00:01:20.801 --> 00:01:24.280
maybe it takes two days to transact rather than actually mailing it across the,

24
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.630
uh, the, the world. Now,

25
00:01:26.631 --> 00:01:30.870
what we're seeing is a transition from those electronic cus to these digital

26
00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:35.190
assets. And so if you look at again, just let's say money, uh, or currency,

27
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.550
every currency in the world's gonna be digital,

28
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.230
you're gonna have a digital dollar, a digital Euro, Y R and B.

29
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.500
You're gonna have decentralized, uh, kind of open source money like Bitcoin.

30
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.260
You're also gonna have private currencies, like Facebook's attempt at DM. Uh,

31
00:01:51.261 --> 00:01:53.140
and there will be others that will try to do this.

32
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.140
And so when you get everything digital, right,

33
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.940
and I think that's the kind of the first step that everyone focuses on the

34
00:01:58.941 --> 00:02:01.460
competition at the technology layer essentially goes away.

35
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.540
You get some level of feature parity and sure.

36
00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:06.650
There's bells and whistles on each kind of implement of a digital currency.

37
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.170
But at the end of the day, the technology is relatively the same. Uh,

38
00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:13.690
and ultimately what it'll do is it will facilitate the adoption of digital

39
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.770
wallets. So you have to have a digital wallet,

40
00:02:15.771 --> 00:02:17.930
regardless of what digital currency you have, same with me,

41
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.730
same with everybody else in the world. But what it does do is when you kind of,

42
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.010
uh, push away and reduce the friction of competition at the, uh,

43
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.680
technology layer, it moves the competition to the monetary policy layer.

44
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.240
And so when you get to that layer, now,

45
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.600
all of a sudden it becomes interesting because all of the currencies are the

46
00:02:34.601 --> 00:02:38.120
same, except for this one right now. And maybe there'll be others in the future.

47
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.360
Uh, but, but for sure, Bitcoin today,

48
00:02:40.361 --> 00:02:42.760
and people may try to replicate in a private manner or something,

49
00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:46.200
but Bitcoin is kind of the, the only finite scare, uh, digital sum.

50
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.070
And so when you then have that pretty big difference in that competition at the

51
00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:56.870
monetary policy layer, it's actually not gonna matter where you get paid. Right?

52
00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.720
And, and what I mean by that is like you and I both live in a single currency

53
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.480
environment. I get paid in dollars.

54
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.360
I historically have saved in dollars.

55
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.640
All of the assets in my life are denominated in dollars.

56
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.680
And I owe my debts and dollars whether it's taxes or, or in the private market.

57
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.870
And I don't have to worry about foreign currencies. I don't exchange any thing.

58
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.270
The only time I would ever think about another currencies is if I'm going to

59
00:03:21.271 --> 00:03:25.510
another country in their single currency environment mm-hmm and in order to

60
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.270
change or exchange my currency,

61
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.990
I go to the bank or I go get ripped off at the airport. &lt;laugh&gt; right. Like,

62
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:34.910
those are my two options. So it's high friction to change between currencies.

63
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.180
When the competition of technology is kind of innovat it away.

64
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.420
Now I can get paid in dollars,

65
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.380
these digital dollars and with a click of a button switch into any other

66
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.413
currency in the world.

67
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.260
And so what ultimately happens is value and liquidity is going to coalesce

68
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.060
around the best monetary policy.

69
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.100
And so you get in this very weird world where even if the United States says,

70
00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:58.740
Hey, you're gonna get paid in dollars. You have to pay your taxes in dollars.

71
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.530
You're start to see people operate in a multicurrency environment where they

72
00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:05.490
say, okay, I got paid to my digital dollar, click a button. I save in Bitcoin.

73
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.570
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, it stays there tax or grows my purchasing power. Oh,

74
00:04:08.571 --> 00:04:09.410
I need to pay my taxes.

75
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.770
Let me switch back into dollars with click of a button and pay.

76
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.290
When you go to a multicurrency world, it's not just about currency.

77
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.130
It's now multi-asset world,

78
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.040
because not only is the currency digitized,

79
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.920
but that same technology is used to digitize stocks, bonds,

80
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.200
and commodities as well.

81
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.120
And so today we live in a very fragmented financial world where basically I have

82
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.000
a brokerage account, I have a bank account.

83
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.040
I may have an alternative asset account, et cetera,

84
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.760
when I can put all those assets in a single digital wallet.

85
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.350
And I can then from asset to asset without having to go back to a single unit of

86
00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:45.184
account, very like.

87
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.310
<v 0>Frictionless, uh, going from asset to.</v>

88
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.143
<v 1>Asset. Yeah.</v>

89
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.830
So now what you end up doing is you start to open up the possibility for machine

90
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.230
to machine transactions. Yeah. So today,

91
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.310
if you and I write software code for two machines to transact with each other,

92
00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.180
yeah.

93
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.780
They can't transact physical currency &lt;affirmative&gt; and in many cases they can't

94
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.940
actually transact the electronic QIP currencies or assets either,

95
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.180
cuz there's too long of a settlement time. So you can't get true automation.

96
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.581
Right.

97
00:05:09.581 --> 00:05:13.220
So the whole idea of like the car's gonna drive over a strip in the road and

98
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.300
it's gonna pay the toll. Right. Well, that can't happen right now.

99
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.620
Cause literally the transaction won't go through &lt;laugh&gt; right.

100
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.250
And so I always joke that like in an automated world, it's like a CD rom,

101
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.570
but we're trying to take cassette tape player assets and put it in the CD rom.

102
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.730
Yeah. It's just incompatible technology references.

103
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.330
<v 0>Uh, nobody understands at this point. So by the way, you need to update.</v>

104
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.770
<v 1>Your references. I probably do.</v>

105
00:05:33.771 --> 00:05:37.890
It's like taking a CD rom trying to put an MP3 player into, uh, streaming. But,

106
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.530
but I think that the reason why that becomes really interesting is when you

107
00:05:40.531 --> 00:05:42.640
start to create these digital all assets,

108
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.440
now you open up the world of possibilities. So when new technologies created,

109
00:05:46.441 --> 00:05:48.720
you can do two things. You can either create new things.

110
00:05:48.721 --> 00:05:51.840
The world's never seen before, or you can use it to improve the old world.

111
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.320
Most people, because it's the easiest thing to think about,

112
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.360
want to improve the old world. So an equivalent of this would be, uh,

113
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.480
when the internet came along a media company that had newspapers would say, Hey,

114
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.400
we should take a PDF of the newspaper and we should put it on a website.

115
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.880
And now anyone in the world can go to this website and they can read the

116
00:06:08.881 --> 00:06:10.920
newspaper today. That was valuable.

117
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.240
But it missed out on the ability to change headlines, to test,

118
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.750
to put multimedia, to distribute it differently, to, you know,

119
00:06:18.751 --> 00:06:21.990
do all kinds of things that today we understand the internet really empowered.

120
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.590
And so what I think we're about to watch happen is we're gonna digitize the

121
00:06:25.591 --> 00:06:28.950
assets. We're gonna put them all into these, uh, digital wallets.

122
00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.310
You're gonna get automated technologies where machines can now transact with

123
00:06:32.311 --> 00:06:34.350
each other and we're gonna do simple things.

124
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.420
Like why do we pay people once every two weeks?

125
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.140
Why don't we just pay them at the end of every day?

126
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.340
Or why don't I literally stream payments to you? Yeah. On an hour by hour basis,

127
00:06:45.341 --> 00:06:46.300
based on the work you do,

128
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.260
it would solve incredible economic issues in our country and in countries around

129
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:52.040
the world.

130
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.540
But historically businesses can't do this because the technology problem,

131
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.210
they can't keep track of it all. How do they pay everyone every day?

132
00:06:58.211 --> 00:07:00.010
How do they pay everyone every hour? Like you just.

133
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.290
<v 0>Can't do it. Yeah. It's funny. The, the,</v>

134
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.210
the vision of the future you're painting, it's kind of an exciting one.

135
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:11.170
And it's almost makes me sad looking into the future when we'll look back at

136
00:07:11.171 --> 00:07:15.970
this time, it's like how incredibly inefficient, uh,

137
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.880
financial transactions were like the transaction of value of any kind,

138
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.600
like how, like what to pay each other. Like there has to like processes,

139
00:07:25.601 --> 00:07:29.800
there's like payroll and all this kind of just the,

140
00:07:29.801 --> 00:07:33.240
the entirety of the transactions is just like painful.

141
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.400
Almost all transactions are painful. And even,

142
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.670
and the companies that innovate to make the transactions a little bit

143
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.910
more frictionless, like Amazon with a one click purchase button,

144
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.950
like win out huge, but even that's really painful.

145
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:50.110
So it's actually really interesting.

146
00:07:50.111 --> 00:07:52.710
Especially then you start to move that into the space of data.

147
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.390
There's a lot of people thinking about privacy and data and like, can we put,

148
00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:58.710
can we, uh,

149
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:04.180
like convert data into like money it's just so that you can pay for

150
00:08:04.181 --> 00:08:07.780
how much you reveal to the companies about your own private data that can then

151
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.940
be used to assign value to you.

152
00:08:10.941 --> 00:08:13.780
So you can use a service for free if you hand over the data,

153
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.220
but there's like explicit transaction going on.

154
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:20.330
So you can empower all those kinds of things that, uh,

155
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.890
will just like fundamentally change our world. That's that's really, really,

156
00:08:23.891 --> 00:08:24.670
really exciting.

157
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.530
<v 1>One of, one of the most interesting things to me, um, is, uh,</v>

158
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.770
I invested in a company called Bridget and what they told me was they said 8

159
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:34.810
billion was paid to the top four banks last year

160
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:37.290
on overdraft fees. Okay.

161
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.960
So literally they took $8 billion from people who didn't have money in their

162
00:08:40.961 --> 00:08:43.600
bank account. &lt;laugh&gt; right. And so when you dig into,

163
00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.600
why is that a lot of times, it's not that the people don't have the money,

164
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.760
it's actually a mismatch of the payments. Yeah.

165
00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.320
So what ends up happening is you get paid on the first and the 15th,

166
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.880
but on the 12th, your Netflix bill hits on the 13th,

167
00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.000
you went grocery shopping and on the 14th, your car payments hit you overdraft.

168
00:09:00.001 --> 00:09:02.320
And then on the 15th you actually get the check and then you're able to pay not

169
00:09:02.321 --> 00:09:04.920
only the overdraft, but for the, uh, expenses that you have.

170
00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.440
And so something as simple as just getting paid at the end of every day

171
00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.760
immediately would eliminate, you know,

172
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:15.270
some big percentage of those $8 billion of value that flows to large

173
00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:16.710
institutions on overdraft fees.

174
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:17.693
<v 0>Yeah. And also,</v>

175
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:22.670
I mean this whole process with overdraft fees and just many of the financial

176
00:09:22.671 --> 00:09:24.270
transactions we have to live through today,

177
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.070
forces many of us to be like accountants,

178
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:33.190
like to understand, uh, the different mechanism of financial,

179
00:09:33.191 --> 00:09:36.060
like the movement of money, as a opposed to you,

180
00:09:36.061 --> 00:09:40.740
which is what we wanna do as human beings operating at higher layers of like

181
00:09:40.741 --> 00:09:45.700
providing services for others of like following your passions and

182
00:09:45.701 --> 00:09:50.300
like working for others, like doing cool or, or, you know,

183
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.420
basically providing value,

184
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:55.260
exchanging value in the world and not thinking about the money,

185
00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.650
the money takes care of itself. And then you see the results of it. So you're,

186
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.810
you're able to think in terms of money,

187
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:08.770
but not have to know how the, like the accounting works.

188
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:14.210
<v 1>Automation simply frees humans up to do more creative work. Yeah. Right. Yeah.</v>

189
00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.280
Like that, like that's it. Yeah.

190
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.080
<v 0>And what we, which is why they use the term,</v>

191
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:21.400
which is why you use the term automation, which I think is kind of brilliant,

192
00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.000
uh, reframing of all of this. Yeah. Cuz.

193
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.640
<v 1>Ultimately digital technologies are merely the conduit to usher us into that</v>

194
00:10:28.641 --> 00:10:29.474
world. Yeah.

195
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:34.400
And I think the most fascinating part of this entire industry

196
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.480
is people who are,

197
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:40.510
are trying to figure out now that we're gonna have these digital technologies,

198
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.750
how do we usher in that automated world faster?

199
00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.790
And so there's people who are building all kinds of incredible things, right.

200
00:10:47.791 --> 00:10:52.550
There's literally, um, some technologies where you can stream,

201
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:56.830
uh, for paying, for consumption of content. Yeah. Right.

202
00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.220
There's I saw somebody recently who they basically said, Hey,

203
00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.180
I have created something,

204
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:07.100
but it's not gonna be released until everyone in almost like a GoFundMe type

205
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.700
situation pays for it in combination, then it gets unlocked.

206
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.020
And so when you start to think about this, it's um,

207
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.300
not only innovation on the technology front, it's innovation around, uh,

208
00:11:16.301 --> 00:11:20.690
the way that we form, uh, capital, it's the way that we, um,

209
00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:23.250
organize resources. It's the way that we build companies.

210
00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.730
It's the business models, right? It's the application of those technologies.

211
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:31.570
All that stuff starts to change and go back to 20. Uh,

212
00:11:31.571 --> 00:11:33.850
2007 is when the iPhone came out,

213
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.170
Uber wasn't possible revenues. Good on the line.

214
00:11:37.171 --> 00:11:40.720
Like all these companies that weren't possible before when the digital

215
00:11:40.721 --> 00:11:43.320
technologies are kind of adopted on a global scale.

216
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:48.440
I think that we all myself included drastically underestimate how fast

217
00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:52.480
and how big innovation can be. Uh, cuz it's just hard, right? Like,

218
00:11:52.481 --> 00:11:53.360
like we like to think.

219
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.880
<v 2>Linearly and that's not how the world works.</v>
