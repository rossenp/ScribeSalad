1
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.400
<v 0>You're running a successful company.</v>

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.140
It's just interesting because my mind has been in that space of, uh,

3
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.430
potentially being one of the millions other entrepreneurs. Uh,

4
00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:19.140
what's your advice on how to build a successful startup,

5
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.790
how to build a successful company?

6
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.560
<v 1>I think that one thing I, I do like,</v>

7
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.220
and it might be a particular thing about America, but like,

8
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.830
there is something about like playing,

9
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.550
tell people what you really want to happen in the world. Like,

10
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.260
don't stop it. It's not, it's not gonna make it. Um,

11
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.440
like if you're asking someone to invest in your company, don't say.

12
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.870
<v 2>I think maybe one day we might make a million.</v>

13
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.040
<v 1>Dollars. Um, when you actually believe something else,</v>

14
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.100
you actually believe you're actually more optimistic,

15
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.810
but you're toning down your optimism because you want to appear,

16
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.290
um, like low risk.

17
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.240
But actually it's super high risk if your company becomes mediocre

18
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.300
because no one wants to work at a mediocre company,

19
00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:12.470
no one wants to invest in the puppy. Um, so you should play the real game.

20
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.230
Um, and obviously this doesn't apply to all businesses,

21
00:01:15.231 --> 00:01:19.730
but if you play a venture backed startup kind of game, like play for keeps,

22
00:01:19.731 --> 00:01:23.960
played a wind, go a big, um, and it's very hard to do that.

23
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.880
I've always feel like, um, I, yeah, I start,

24
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.500
you can start narrowing, narrowing your focus because 10 people are telling you,

25
00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:34.250
you know,

26
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.360
you got to care about this boring thing that won't matter five years from now.

27
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.370
Right. And you should push back and do the real play the real game. So.

28
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.100
<v 0>Be bold. So both, I mean, there's a,</v>

29
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.620
there's an interesting duality there.

30
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.450
So there's w w the way you speak to other people about like your plans

31
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.340
and what you are like privately just in, in your own mind.

32
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.190
<v 1>And maybe it's connected with what you were saying about yeah.</v>

33
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.380
Sincerity as well. Like if you,

34
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.330
if you appear to be sincerely optimistic about something that's

35
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:09.740
big or crazy,

36
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.520
it it's putting yourself up to be kind of like ridiculed or something.

37
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.770
And so if you say my mission, my mission is to, um, yeah, go to Mars.

38
00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:22.790
It's just so bonkers that, uh, it's hard to say.

39
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.210
<v 0>It is, but, uh, uh, one powerful thing,</v>

40
00:02:26.211 --> 00:02:30.890
just like you said is if you say it and you believe it,

41
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.010
then actually amazing people, uh, come and work with you. Exactly.

42
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.140
It's not just skill, but the dreams, there's something about optimism that, uh,

43
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.680
that like that fire that you have when you're optimistic of actually having the

44
00:02:45.681 --> 00:02:48.050
hope of building something totally cool.

45
00:02:48.051 --> 00:02:51.830
Something totally new that when those people get in a room together,

46
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.360
like they can actually do it. Yeah. Uh, yeah. There's yeah. There's,

47
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.300
that's, uh, and also makes life really fun when you're in that room.

48
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.190
So all of that together, uh, ultimately, I don't know,

49
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:09.580
that's what makes this crazy ride of a startup really, uh,

50
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.780
look fun and Elis is an example of a person who succeeded that does that many

51
00:03:13.781 --> 00:03:18.670
other inspiring figures, which is sad. Uh, I used to be a Google and there's,

52
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.983
um,

53
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.400
there's something that happens that sometimes when the company grows bigger and

54
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:29.260
bigger and bigger, where that kind of ambition kind of quiets down a little bit,

55
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:30.191
you know, uh,

56
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:34.600
Google had this ambition still does of making the world's information accessible

57
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.340
to everyone. And I remember, I don't know, that's beautiful. I,

58
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.960
I still love that dream of that. You know, these, the scan books,

59
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:48.280
but just in every way possible make there was information accessible.

60
00:03:48.281 --> 00:03:52.210
Same with Wikipedia. Every time I open up Wikipedia, um,

61
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.610
I'm just awe inspired by how awesome humans are man

62
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.060
at creating this together. I don't know what the meetings are over there,

63
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:06.010
but they, it's just beautiful. Like what they've created is incredible.

64
00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:08.860
And I'd love to be able to be part of something like that.

65
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.040
And you're right for that. You have to be bold.

66
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.760
<v 1>And there's an strange to me also, I think you're right.</v>

67
00:04:14.761 --> 00:04:17.550
That there's how many boring companies they are. Right.

68
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.250
It's something I always talk about, especially in FinTech. It's like,

69
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.200
why am I excited about this? This is so lame. Like, what is this?

70
00:04:25.201 --> 00:04:28.770
Isn't even like important. Even if you succeed, this is going to be like,

71
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.800
terrible. Like this is not good. Um,

72
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.740
and it's just strange how people can kind of get fake,

73
00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:39.420
enthusiastic about like boring ideas when there's so

74
00:04:39.421 --> 00:04:43.830
many bigger ideas that, um, yeah. I mean,

75
00:04:43.831 --> 00:04:46.230
you read these things like this company raises money and it's just like,

76
00:04:46.231 --> 00:04:48.750
that's a lot of money for the worst idea I've ever heard.

77
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.170
<v 0>Some ideas are really big.</v>

78
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.690
So like I worked on autonomous vehicles quite a bit.

79
00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.000
And there's so many ways in which you can present that idea to yourself,

80
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.280
to the team you work with to just, yeah.

81
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.970
Like to yourself when you're quietly looking in the mirror in the morning, uh,

82
00:05:05.971 --> 00:05:08.610
that's really boring or really exciting.

83
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.530
Like if you're really ambitious with the autonomous vehicles there, it,

84
00:05:13.531 --> 00:05:17.970
it changes the nature of like human robot interaction is it changes the nature

85
00:05:17.971 --> 00:05:20.520
of how we move, forget money. If you get all that stuff,

86
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.080
it changes like everything about robotics and AI machine learning.

87
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.410
It changes everything about manufacturing. I mean, cars,

88
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.760
transportation is so fundamentally connected to cars. And if that changes,

89
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.130
it's changing the fabric of society, of movies, of everything. Uh,

90
00:05:38.131 --> 00:05:40.890
and if you go bold and take risks and go,

91
00:05:40.891 --> 00:05:44.790
be willing to go bankrupt with your company, uh,

92
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.390
as opposed to cautiously, you can, you can really change the world.

93
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.120
And so sad for me to see all these autonomous companies,

94
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.411
Thomas vehicle companies,

95
00:05:52.411 --> 00:05:57.030
they're like really more focused about fundraising and kind of like smoke and

96
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.250
mirrors are really afraid.

97
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.440
Then the entirety of their marketing is grounded in fear and presenting

98
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:05.840
enough smoke to where they keep raising funds.

99
00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:10.550
So they can cautiously use technology of a previous decade or previous two

100
00:06:10.551 --> 00:06:13.910
decades to kind of test vehicles here and there,

101
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:19.070
as opposed to do crazy things and go huge at scale to

102
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:23.600
huge data collection. And, um, yeah, so that's just an example,

103
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:25.220
like the idea, it can be big,

104
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:30.140
but if you don't allow yourself to take that idea and think really big with it,

105
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.750
uh, then you're not going to make anything happen.
