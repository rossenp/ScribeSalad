1
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.030
<v 0>So there is a, you, you write about it straight,</v>

2
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.870
but there's a humor to it because it's an absurdly evil place,

3
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.910
I suppose. Yeah. A bunch of people I asked,

4
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.350
I asked, uh, I said that I'm talking to you in a bunch of past questions. Oh,

5
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:22.230
good. I gotta hear.

6
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.260
<v 1>From the PLE you asked me before we start recording, I specifically said, no,</v>

7
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.660
it was in my contract. &lt;laugh&gt;.

8
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.140
<v 0>Uh, yeah. And you gave, I gave you all the pink Skittles or whatever. Uh,</v>

9
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.780
but they, oh, think.

10
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.690
<v 1>Skit, you know.</v>

11
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.140
<v 0>Pink I'm trolling. Michael, let me explain to you how that works.</v>

12
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.420
Uh, and people should go, uh, malice.locals.com, which,

13
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.490
and sign up and, uh, pay. I think the membership fee several thousand dollars.

14
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.130
It's very it's it's yeah, it's not, it's not for the layman. Yeah. But uh,

15
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.010
the service &lt;laugh&gt; you get a coat with it. Uh, but yeah,

16
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.930
I, I went there posted a lot of really brilliant people there.

17
00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:05.760
People should join that community. If you find, uh, Michael interesting.

18
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.000
Or if you just want to go and say, why he's wrong,

19
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.160
it's a great place to have that place for.

20
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.680
<v 1>That. &lt;laugh&gt; I assure you.</v>

21
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.000
<v 0>Uh, yeah, a lot of really kind people. So anyway,</v>

22
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.120
there's a bunch of people ask that we should talk about humor. Okay.

23
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.950
So pretend hypothetically speaking the, then I'm a robot &lt;laugh&gt;

24
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.030
&lt;laugh&gt; asking you to explain humor to me. &lt;laugh&gt; what,

25
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.390
so dear reader, I mean, there's a humor. There's there's,

26
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:41.350
you're so wonderfully dance between serious dark

27
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.750
topics and then

28
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.100
serious dark humor. Yeah. Can you try to, uh,

29
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.060
if you were to write like a, I don't know, Wikipedia article,

30
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.500
maybe a book about your philosophy of humor,

31
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.020
what do you think is the role of humor in all of this? Well.

32
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.340
<v 1>A joke is like a baby. You can't, uh,</v>

33
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.740
dissect it and then put it back together and expect it to work.

34
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.970
Trust me on this one. &lt;laugh&gt; fight. No matter how you carve that thing up,

35
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.570
it's not gonna be working the next day. And,

36
00:02:10.571 --> 00:02:14.450
and you need it to sew those little sneakers with those hands. Oh, um,

37
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.930
I don't know that humor is something that is very explainable people.

38
00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:22.890
There's something called clapper where this is like the worst kind of humor

39
00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:25.370
where people applaud. Cuz they agree with what you're saying.

40
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.800
A lap that's still that's that's the kind as the poetry.

41
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.680
<v 0>You're reading. Yeah.</v>

42
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.760
<v 1>The, and the drag Queens do that too. Um, I think cuz they have the nails.</v>

43
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.400
&lt;laugh&gt; visceral. You laugh. It's a visceral reaction. Yeah.

44
00:02:38.401 --> 00:02:41.400
When someone on Twitter is insisting, you know, that's not funny,

45
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.960
you're not in a position to make that claim and let's, let's go,

46
00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:49.270
let's go back to North Korea. I had a refugee, uh,

47
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.710
I knew and he went to high school here and he was talking to his buddies and

48
00:02:53.711 --> 00:02:58.070
they said, um, Hey, remember when we were kids, we had Pokemon and he goes,

49
00:02:58.071 --> 00:03:00.640
oh yeah. Except instead of Pokemon, I watched my dad star to death,

50
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.360
which is the truth. Now who are,

51
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.880
who are any of us to tell him, not to make that joke? Yeah.

52
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.080
I don't know what it's like watching anyone, including my dad, uh,

53
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.440
star to death and my dad's fatty. So he's not going hungry anytime soon. Um,

54
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.750
so it's very but bizarre to me when

55
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.070
people feel comfortable,

56
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.190
precluding others from making jokes, especially.

57
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.230
And I think this is a very Jewish thing like this kind of galls humor,

58
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.390
especially when it's some laughing about a personal, uh,

59
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.230
loss or experience that they've had.

60
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.380
Humor is a great way to mitigate um, uh, uh,

61
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:45.220
pain and suffering. But it's also, I think this why it's a Jewish thing. It's,

62
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:49.100
it's a black thing. When you are a marginalized community or poorer, it's free,

63
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.300
uh, telling stories, telling jokes or songs, you don't have to have money,

64
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.380
but you can have joy and happiness.

65
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.810
And I think that's why you find it so much more in kind of lower status

66
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:06.490
communities than you're finding like wasps who are notoriously, uh, humorless,

67
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.850
which.

68
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.850
<v 0>Is strange because people pay you a lot of money for the jokes you do.</v>

69
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.450
So it's not really free.

70
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.850
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; yeah, well, Nope. They don't have to pay me. I it's it's um,</v>

71
00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:17.170
appreciated, but not expected.

72
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.720
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; I find my voice cracking every time I try to make a joke.</v>

73
00:04:20.721 --> 00:04:24.960
Like I fail miserably at this. Uh, so some people, uh.

74
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.920
<v 1>You're still in beta. That's what I alpha sure. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. Being an alphas,</v>

75
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:32.880
like being a lady, if you have to tell people you are you aren't? No.

76
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.240
<v 0>I'm meant alpha version not. Oh.</v>

77
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.080
<v 1>Okay. I don't know. You're robot. Goly cook. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

78
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.510
<v 0>I not going there. Okay. Uh, who you talking to? In my own head?</v>

79
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.430
I'm talking to myself in my own head. Okay. Speaking of North Korea.
