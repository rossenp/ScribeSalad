00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:03.860
<v 0>What about looking at,</v>

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.660
at a particular characteristics of both physical ideas and mathematical ideas,

3
00:00:07.661 --> 00:00:12.220
which is beauty. Do you think beauty leads us astray, meaning, um, and,

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.740
and you offline showed me a, uh, a really nice puzzle that illustrates this, uh,

5
00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:18.460
this idea a little bit, not,

6
00:00:18.461 --> 00:00:21.980
maybe you can speak to that or another example where, uh,

7
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.850
beauty makes it tempting for us to assume that the,

8
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.570
the law and the theory we found is actually one that perfectly describes

9
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:31.404
reality.

10
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.730
<v 1>I think that beauty does not, uh,</v>

11
00:00:33.731 --> 00:00:38.130
lead as astray because I feel that beauty is a requirement for

12
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.170
principles of physics.

13
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.210
<v 0>So beauty is a fundamental in the.</v>

14
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.570
<v 1>Universe. I think beauty is fundamental.</v>

15
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.720
At least that's the way many of us view it. It's not emergent. &lt;laugh&gt;,

16
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.400
it's not emergent. I think,

17
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.240
I think Hardy is the mathematician who said that there's no permanent place for

18
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.080
ugly mathematics &lt;laugh&gt;. And so I think the same is true in physics, uh, that,

19
00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.480
uh, if we find the principle which looks ugly, uh, we are not going to be,

20
00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:03.760
that's not the end stage. So therefore beauty is going to lead us somewhere.

21
00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:08.230
Now it doesn't mean beauty is enough. It doesn't mean if you just have beauty.

22
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.110
If I just look at, uh, something is beautiful, then I'm fine. No,

23
00:01:11.111 --> 00:01:11.930
that's not the case.

24
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.390
Beauty is certainly a criteria that every good physical theory should pass.

25
00:01:16.391 --> 00:01:19.550
That's at least the view we have. Why do we have this view?

26
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.150
That's a good question. It is a partly, uh,

27
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.420
you could say based on expert experience of science over centuries,

28
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.420
partly is a philosophical view of what, what, what reality is or should be.

29
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.060
And, uh, in principle, you know,

30
00:01:34.061 --> 00:01:37.460
it could have been ugly and we might have had to deal with it,

31
00:01:37.461 --> 00:01:39.180
but we have gotten maybe, uh,

32
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.380
confident through examples after examples in the history of science to look for

33
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.493
Butte.

34
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.250
<v 0>In our sense of be beauty seems to incorporate a lot of things that are</v>

35
00:01:47.251 --> 00:01:49.890
essential for us to solve some difficult problems like symmetry.

36
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.770
We find symmetry beautiful, and the breaking of symmetry beautiful.

37
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.410
Somehow symmetry is a,

38
00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.650
is a fundamental part of how we conceive of beauty at all.

39
00:02:00.651 --> 00:02:05.130
Layers of reality, which is interesting, like, uh, in, in both the visual,

40
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.000
like way we look at art, we look at each other as human beings,

41
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:11.400
the way we look at creatures in the biological space,

42
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.880
the way we look at chemistry and then into the physics world, as, as,

43
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.720
as the work you do, as it's kind of interesting, it, it makes you wonder, like

44
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.880
which one is the chicken or the egg assymetry, the,

45
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.190
the chicken and our conception of beauty, the egg, or the, the other way around,

46
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.830
or somehow the fact that every the symmetry is, is part of reality,

47
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.590
is it somehow creates the brain that then is able to perceive it,

48
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.950
or maybe that's,

49
00:02:36.951 --> 00:02:41.430
this is just cuz we maybe it's so obvious.

50
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.940
It's almost trivial that symmetry of course will be part of every C kind of

51
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.740
universe that's possible. Uh, and then our,

52
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.020
any kind of organism that's able to observe that universe is going to

53
00:02:54.021 --> 00:02:55.860
appreciate, uh, symmetry.

54
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.980
<v 1>Well, these are good questions. Uh,</v>

55
00:02:57.981 --> 00:03:01.480
we don't have a deep understanding of why we get attracted to symmetry. Yeah.

56
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.640
Why do laws of nature seem to have symmetries underlying them

57
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.920
and the reasoning or the examples of whether if there wasn't symmetry,

58
00:03:10.921 --> 00:03:14.200
we would've understood it or not. We could have said that. Yeah. If there were,

59
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.760
you know, things we shouldn't look at great. We could understand them.

60
00:03:16.761 --> 00:03:21.550
For example, we know at symmetries get broken and we have appreciated nature

61
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.950
in the broken symmetry phase as well.

62
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.390
The world we live in has many things we do not look symmetric,

63
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.550
but even those have underlying symmetry when you look at it more deeply.

64
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.270
So we have gotten maybe spoiled perhaps by,

65
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.500
by the appearance of symmetry all over the place and we look for it and, and um,

66
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.970
I think this is,

67
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.060
this is perhaps related to sense of aesthetics that scientists have.

68
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.140
And we don't usually talk about it among scientists. Uh, in fact,

69
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.100
it's kind of a philosophical view of why do we look for simplicity or beauty or

70
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:57.140
so forth. And, uh, I think in a sense,

71
00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.570
scientists are a lot like philosophers sometimes I think especially modern

72
00:04:02.571 --> 00:04:06.490
science seems to shine what Sean's philosophers and philosophical views mm-hmm

73
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.490
&lt;affirmative&gt;. And I think at their peril, I think, I think in my view, science,

74
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.010
uh, owes a lot to philosophy and in my view, many scientists,

75
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.930
in fact, probably all good scientists are perhaps amateur philosophers.

76
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.320
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; they may not state that they are philosophers or they,

77
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:26.160
they may not like to be labeled philosophers, but in many ways,

78
00:04:26.161 --> 00:04:29.560
what they do is like what is philosophical takes of things,

79
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.720
looking for simplicity or symmetries, an example of that in my opinion,

80
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.520
or seeing patterns you see, for example, another example of the symmetries,

81
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.190
like how you come up with ideas in science, you see, for example,

82
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.390
an idea a is connected with an idea B okay, so you,

83
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.590
you study this connection very deeply and then you find the cousin of an idea,

84
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.150
a, let me call it a prime.

85
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.710
And then you immediately look for B prime, if a is like B, and if there's an,

86
00:04:57.711 --> 00:05:02.340
a prime, then you look for B prime. Why? Well it come pleases the picture,

87
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.780
why? Well it's philosophically appealing to have more balance in terms of that.

88
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.140
And then you look for B prime and low and behold,

89
00:05:09.141 --> 00:05:11.740
you find this other phenomenon, which is a physical phenomenon,

90
00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:12.620
which you call B prime.

91
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.260
So this kind of thinking motivates asking questions and looking for things.

92
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.300
And it has guided scientists, I think, through many centuries.

93
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.330
And I think it continue is to do so today.
