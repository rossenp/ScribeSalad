00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.030
<v 0>You said NCHA, one of your favorite philosophers? He said, uh,</v>

2
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.430
famously one of the many famous things he said is that God is dead. Yes.

3
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.230
Oh, what do you think he meant? Do you think he was right.

4
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.510
<v 1>Okay, good. I love this question.</v>

5
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.740
No one asks me about Nisha &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt; And I love Nisha.

6
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.780
Awesome. Okay. So, um, first actually I do think,

7
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.220
and I could be corrected and probably will be in all the comments. Yeah.

8
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.700
Ne well, first Nisha. It's true. Wasn't the first to say God is dead.

9
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.580
I think Hagle said it. Okay. No one read Hale.

10
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.540
He's like so difficult to read that it's impossible.

11
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.460
<v 0>Same with Heer as you mentioned, he.</v>

12
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.490
<v 1>Yeah, I love him, but yeah, he's really hard. Um,</v>

13
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.370
so NCHE basically said God is dead.

14
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.970
And let me give you the context for him saying that he also said this,

15
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.050
he said there was only one Christian. He died on the cross. Mm. Okay. So, um,

16
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.730
he despised Christianity and he said that.

17
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.570
<v 0>And, and the people who practic.</v>

18
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.480
<v 1>It. Absolutely. Yeah. But again, he believed in Jesus and he believed Jesus was,</v>

19
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.640
he didn't believe he was a divinity.

20
00:01:06.641 --> 00:01:10.280
Believed Jesus was a good man and he died on the cross. Okay. So.

21
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.000
<v 0>He believed in the morality. Yeah, he.</v>

22
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.160
<v 1>Did. Yeah, he did. Um,</v>

23
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.840
and Nisha basically was making a historical statement about God is dead.

24
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.520
He said, and he was right. He was basically saying that in this,

25
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.230
in the century in which he lived, um, and he died, I think in 1900,

26
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.590
again, I could be wrong about that.

27
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.910
So I just wanna say that I believe he died in 1900. Right. Okay. So,

28
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.070
so he is writing in the 18 hundreds and he's basically saying, um,

29
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.710
God is dead and we killed him. Okay.

30
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.950
So he is making a historical statement that at that point in time with science,

31
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.220
just kind of getting better and industrialization yeah. Happening. Um,

32
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.220
the idea of, um, this,

33
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.100
this thing beyond what we know as material

34
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.020
reality is dead. So this,

35
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.260
the substrate of Western civilization is dead.

36
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.370
That's what NCHE NCHE is saying. Mm. If that makes sense. Yes.

37
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.530
And he basically says with that comes the Uber me. Okay.

38
00:02:14.531 --> 00:02:18.570
Which is the superhuman. And he says, there aren't many of them, he says,

39
00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:21.490
but they're gonna come. And he also talks about the philosophers of the future.

40
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.970
And he's speaking and writing to them is my belief.

41
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.280
So he's basical really telling you and me because we are now the philosophers of

42
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.280
his future. Yeah. He's basically telling us this is what's happening now.

43
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.000
And look what it has done. He says, now everything is,

44
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.920
is possible all manner of, of terrible evil,

45
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.990
because no one has the belief in God anymore. The belief, the, it there's, uh,

46
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.430
that there is an afterlife, you asked about an afterlife.

47
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.870
So with this kind of belief in a morality comes this belief, you know,

48
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.350
and you can have morals without God. Okay. People do.

49
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.200
But what Christianity is this idea that you will

50
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.080
reap what you sow. So if people don't believe that anymore, what will happen?

51
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.840
And so that's what he's basically saying is that the,

52
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.080
the basic anchor for Western society is now gone. Do.

53
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.810
<v 0>You think he was right?</v>

54
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.320
<v 1>Absolutely. Absolutely.</v>

55
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.160
<v 0>Right. But then again,</v>

56
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.430
what do you think if we brought him back to life and he read American cosmic,

57
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.910
your book, um, and he wrote, he tweeted about it, right.

58
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.790
&lt;laugh&gt; writing a review maybe for the,

59
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.310
I don't know what they post for New York times. He'd be an editorial writer, um,

60
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.950
with a blue check mark on Twitter. Uh,

61
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.380
what do you think he would say about this idea that you present?

62
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.380
That's a grander idea of religion than, you know,

63
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.610
like.

64
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.300
<v 1>Religiosity, like this form.</v>

65
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.140
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. Wouldn't that kind of reverse the idea that God is dead.</v>

66
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:55.370
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

67
00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.250
Because it would bring up this idea of external intelligences that are

68
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.570
not human, which is basically a lot of religions. Talk about that. Right.

69
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:08.810
There are body sofas, there are angels, there are demons, you know,

70
00:04:08.811 --> 00:04:12.850
there are all these types of nonhuman intelligences that

71
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.170
religion makes space for.

72
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.400
So what I'm basically saying in American cosmic is these new things a are

73
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.040
within the realm of UFOs and UAPs. So would no,

74
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.360
I think that, well,

75
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.680
I think Nisha would say that that's a progressive adaptation of

76
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.720
religion is what I would hope he would say. NCHE however is unpredictable.

77
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.760
I think I, I couldn't predict him.

78
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.910
So I would say that it would be my hope that he would say this is

79
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.030
an accurate representation of a move into a new type

80
00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:52.750
of religion and it's adaptive. Therefore progressive.

81
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.870
<v 0>He would probably be uncomfortable reading a book by brilliant Fe uh,</v>

82
00:04:56.871 --> 00:04:58.670
female professor. He happens.

83
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.340
<v 1>Also to be short &lt;laugh&gt;. I don't know if you, you read that.</v>

84
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.693
No. Yeah.

85
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.540
<v 0>Oh, he's.</v>

86
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.740
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; he said some pretty nasty things about short women. &lt;laugh&gt; oh my God.</v>

87
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.380
<v 0>Yeah. A Nisha. He should be canceled &lt;laugh&gt; no, no,</v>

88
00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:18.220
please don't cancel NCHA. You have to take people in the context of their time,

89
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.770
although I'm pretty sure in his time he was also so an. He was.

90
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.963
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

91
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.770
<v 0>But are people too.</v>

92
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.130
<v 1>Okay. Just bad ones.</v>
