00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.880
<v 0>You're old and wise at this stage.</v>

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.960
&lt;laugh&gt; so have you discovered meaning to this whole thing?

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.200
Why the hell are we descendants of, um, apes here on earth?

4
00:00:12.201 --> 00:00:14.320
What's the meaning of it? What's the meaning of life.

5
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.400
<v 1>I haven't and it, and I am in, so the crazy,</v>

6
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.800
so the best learning for me has been like,

7
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.510
no matter what level of success you achieve,

8
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.350
you're still worried about similar things.

9
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.910
Just maybe on a slightly different scale.

10
00:00:28.911 --> 00:00:31.510
You're still concerned about the same things.

11
00:00:31.511 --> 00:00:34.230
You're still self-conscious about the same things is like,

12
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.350
and actually that moment going through that is what makes you believe.

13
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:44.700
There's gotta be like more machinery to life or per this to life. And that,

14
00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:47.740
that we're all chasing these materialistic things.

15
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.700
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but you start, you start realizing like, um,

16
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:51.660
it's almost like, you know,

17
00:00:51.661 --> 00:00:55.940
the Truman show when he gets the edge and he like knocks against it. He's like,

18
00:00:55.941 --> 00:00:56.774
what? Like,

19
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.140
there's this awakening that happens when you get to that edge that you realize,

20
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.450
oh, like, sure, it's great. It's great that we all chase money and fame and,

21
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.690
and, and success, but you hit the edge and,

22
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.850
and I'm not even claiming I hit an edge, like, like Elon's hit an edge.

23
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.250
Like there's clearly larger skills, but what's cool is you learn that, like,

24
00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:16.370
it doesn't actually matter.

25
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.450
And that there are all these other things that truly matter. Um,

26
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.770
that's not a case for working less hard. That's not a case for taking it easy.

27
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.960
That's not a is for the four day work. We,

28
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.160
what that is a case for is designing your life exactly the way you want to

29
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:35.440
design it. Cuz I don't know. I, I think we go around the, or you know,

30
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.080
the sun a, a certain number of times and then we die and then that's it.

31
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.240
That's me. Are you afraid of that moment? No, not at all.

32
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.470
In fact or least not yet. Um,

33
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.790
listen, I'm like a pilot, like I do. Yeah. Crazy things. And I like,

34
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.390
um, no, I like, if anything, I'm like, Ooh,

35
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.230
I gotta choose, uh, uh,

36
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.590
mindfully and purposefully the thing I am doing right now and not just for

37
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.490
all into it,

38
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.380
because you're gonna wake up one day and ask yourself why the hell you spent the

39
00:02:09.381 --> 00:02:11.300
last 10 years doing X, Y or Z. Yeah.

40
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.260
So I guess my like shorter answer to this is

41
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.380
doing things on purpose because you choose to do them so

42
00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:25.260
important in life and not just like floating down the river of life,

43
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.090
hitting branche of is along the way. Cuz you will hit branches. Right.

44
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.650
But rather like literally plotting a course and not having a 10 plan,

45
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.170
but just choosing every day to opt in.

46
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.170
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that I think has been more like,

47
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.850
I haven't figured out the meaning of life by any stretch of the imagination,

48
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.170
but it certainly isn't money.

49
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.200
It certainly isn't fame and it certainly isn't travel and it's like,

50
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.720
and it's way more of like opting into the game. You love playing.

51
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.700
<v 0>Every day.</v>

52
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.200
<v 1>Opting in, just opting in and like don't let it happen. You opt in.</v>

53
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.400
<v 0>Kevin. Uh, it's great to end on, uh,</v>

54
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.040
love and the meaning of life. This is an amazing conversation. A lot of fun.

55
00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:11.280
Thank you. You gave me like a light into some fascinating aspects of this, uh,

56
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.440
the technical world and I can't honestly wait to see what you do next.

57
00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.710
Thank you so much. Thanks for having me.
