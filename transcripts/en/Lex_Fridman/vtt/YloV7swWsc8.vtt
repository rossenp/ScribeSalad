1
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.680
<v 0>Another historic moment. This is perhaps outside, but perhaps within your,</v>

2
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.960
uh, space of frameworks that you think about that just happened. Uh,

3
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.090
I guess a couple of weeks ago is, um,

4
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.100
I don't know if you're paying attention at all, is the,

5
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.330
the game stop and while she bets, uh,

6
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.390
so it's really fascinating. There's kind of a theme to this competition today.

7
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.240
Cause it's like neural networks. [inaudible]

8
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.240
, it's cool. How there's a large number of people in a distributed way. Almost having a kind of fun. 

9
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.240
We're able to take on the powerful leads, uh,

10
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.240
lead hedge funds, centralized powers and overpower them. Uh,

11
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.073
 do you have thoughts? I mean this whole saga.

12
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.240
<v 1>I don't know enough about finance, but it was like the Elan, you know,</v>

13
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.200
Robin hood guy, when they talk about that. Well,

14
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.920
Robin hood guy didn't know how to finance system marked. That was clear, right?

15
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.660
He was treating like the people who settled the transactions as a black box and

16
00:01:08.661 --> 00:01:10.340
suddenly somebody called him up and say, Hey,

17
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.960
Blackbox calling you your transaction volume means you need to put out $3

18
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.760
billion right now. And he's like, I don't have $3 billion.

19
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.040
Like I don't even make any money on these trades.

20
00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:22.040
Why do I have $3 billion while you're sponsoring a trade? So,

21
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.630
so there was a set of abstractions that, you know, I don't think either like,

22
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.600
like now we understand it. Like this happens in chip design.

23
00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:33.590
Like you buy wafers from TSMC or Samsung or Intel.

24
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.520
And you know, they say it works like this and you do your design based on that.

25
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.260
And then chip comes back and it doesn't work.

26
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.350
And suddenly you started having to open the black boxes.

27
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.920
The transistors really work. Like they said, you know, what's the real issue.

28
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.620
So, so the

29
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.440
there's a whole set of things that created this opportunity and somebody spotted

30
00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:58.370
it. Now, people spot these kinds of opportunities all the time.

31
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.970
So there's been flash crashes. There's been, you know, there's always short.

32
00:02:01.971 --> 00:02:05.240
Squeezes are fairly regular. Every CEO I know,

33
00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:08.570
hates the shorts because they're, they're manipulating,

34
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.770
they're trying to manipulate their stock in a way that they make money and,

35
00:02:12.771 --> 00:02:16.760
you know, deprive value from both the company on the investors.

36
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.220
So the fact that so many stocks were so short,

37
00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:26.420
it's hilarious that this hasn't happened before. I don't know why.

38
00:02:26.421 --> 00:02:30.830
And I don't actually know why some serious hedge funds didn't do it to other

39
00:02:30.831 --> 00:02:34.340
hedge funds. And some of the hedge funds actually made a lot of money on this.

40
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.980
So my guess is we know 5% of what really happened.

41
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.380
And a lot of the players don't know what happened and people probably made the

42
00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:49.100
most money. Aren't the people that they're talking about. Yeah. That's okay.

43
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.390
<v 0>Do you think there was something, uh, I mean, this is, this is the cool kind of,</v>

44
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.390
uh, Ilan, uh,

45
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.910
you're the same kind of conversationalist,

46
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.970
which is like first principles questions of like, what the hell happened.

47
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.220
Uh, just very basic questions of like, was there something shady going on? Uh,

48
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.160
what, you know, who are the parties involved?

49
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.110
This is the basic questions that everybody wants to know about.

50
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.600
<v 1>Yeah. So like we're in a very competitive hyper competitive world, right?</v>

51
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.290
But transactions like buying sewing soccer is a trust event. You know,

52
00:03:22.291 --> 00:03:25.200
I trust the company representing themselves properly. You know,

53
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.570
I bought the stock because I think it's going to go up.

54
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.060
I trust that the regulations are solid now, inside of that,

55
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.750
there's all kinds of places where, you know, humans over trust.

56
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.990
And you know, this, this expose,

57
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.210
let's say some weak points in the system.

58
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.380
I don't know if that's going to get corrected. I don't know.

59
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.770
I don't know if we have close to the real story. My,

60
00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:54.210
my suspicion is we don't and listen to that guy.

61
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.540
You look a little wide-eyed about it. And then he did this and then he did that.

62
00:03:57.541 --> 00:04:02.100
And I was like, Hmm, I think he should know more about your business than that.

63
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.690
But again, there's many businesses when like this layer is really stable.

64
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.490
You stop paying attention to it.

65
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.020
You pay attention to the stuff that's bugging you or new, right?

66
00:04:13.021 --> 00:04:15.570
You don't pay attention to the stuff that just seems to work all the time.

67
00:04:15.571 --> 00:04:20.400
You just, you know, sky is blue every day, California and where what's wild,

68
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.530
know it rains. And it was like, what do we do?

69
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.180
Somebody go bring in the lawn furniture. You know, like it's getting wet,

70
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.280
it's getting wet. I was blue for a hundred days. And now it's, you know,

71
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.263
so.

72
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.980
<v 0>Part of the problem here with Vlad, this, the CEO of Robin hood is as a scaling.</v>

73
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.050
Cause it would have been talking about is there's a lot of unexpected

74
00:04:43.051 --> 00:04:45.570
things that happen with the scaling and you have to be,

75
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.010
I think the scaling forces you to then return to the fundamentals.

76
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.730
<v 1>Well, it's interesting because when you buy and sell stocks, the scaling is,</v>

77
00:04:53.731 --> 00:04:56.730
you know, the stocks only move in a certain range. And if you buy a stock,

78
00:04:56.731 --> 00:04:59.940
you can only lose that amount of money. On the short, short market.

79
00:04:59.941 --> 00:05:04.680
You can lose a lot more than you can benefit. Like it has, it has a weird cost,

80
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.110
you know, cost function or whatever the right word for that is.

81
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.550
So he was trading in a market or he wasn't actually capitalized for the

82
00:05:11.551 --> 00:05:16.380
downside. If it got outside a certain range. Now,

83
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.480
whether something nefarious has happened, I have no idea. But at some point the,

84
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.190
uh, the financial risk to both him and his customers was way outside of his

85
00:05:26.191 --> 00:05:29.940
financial capacity and his understanding how the system work was clearly

86
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.020
weak or, uh, or he didn't represent himself. I, you know,

87
00:05:34.021 --> 00:05:37.800
I don't know the person, then I listened to them and it could have been,

88
00:05:37.801 --> 00:05:41.190
the surprise question was like, these guys called him. No,

89
00:05:41.191 --> 00:05:45.720
it sounded like he was treating stuff as a black box. Maybe he shouldn't have,

90
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.570
but maybe he has a whole pilot expert somewhere else. And it was going on.

91
00:05:48.571 --> 00:05:50.010
I don't, I don't know. Yeah.

92
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.080
<v 0>I mean, this is, uh,</v>

93
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.980
this is one of the qualities of a good leader is under fire.

94
00:05:55.981 --> 00:06:00.890
You have to perform. And that means to think clearly and to speak clearly.

95
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.930
And he dropped the ball on those things cause and understand the problem

96
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.561
quickly,

97
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:11.480
learn and understand the problem at like at the like basic level,

98
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:12.830
like what the hell happened.

99
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.120
<v 1>And my guess is, you know,</v>

100
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.390
at some level it was amateur is trading against, you know,

101
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.340
experts slash insiders slash people with special information outside is

102
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.820
insiders. Yeah. And the insiders, you know,

103
00:06:27.821 --> 00:06:30.460
my guess is the next time this happens. We'll make money on it.

104
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.680
<v 0>The insiders always went.</v>

105
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.970
<v 1>Well. They have more tools and more incentive. I mean, this always happens.</v>

106
00:06:36.971 --> 00:06:41.230
Like the outsiders are doing this for fun. The insiders are doing this 24 seven.

107
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.280
<v 0>Numbers in the outsiders. This is an interesting thing.</v>

108
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.520
<v 1>There's numbers on the insiders too. Like kinda numbers,</v>

109
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:51.400
different kind of numbers.

110
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.580
<v 0>But this could be a new era because I don't know,</v>

111
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:58.690
at least I didn't expect that a bunch of Redditers could, you know, there's a,

112
00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.990
you know, millions of people can get to the next one. Won't be a surprise.

113
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.250
But don't you think the, the,

114
00:07:04.251 --> 00:07:06.820
the crowd that people are planning the next attack.

115
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.930
<v 1>We'll see, but it has to be a surprise. Can't be the same game</v>

116
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.040
as like, it could be,

117
00:07:15.041 --> 00:07:18.970
there's a very large number of games to play and they can be told about it.

118
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.350
I don't know. I'm not an expert.

119
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.260
<v 0>Right. That's a good question. How about the space of games?</v>

120
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:24.850
How restricted is it?

121
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:30.190
<v 1>Yeah. And the system is so complicated. It could be relatively unrestricted.</v>

122
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:35.560
And also like during the last couple of financial crashes, you know,

123
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:40.190
what set it off was, you know, sets of derivative events where, you know,

124
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.360
that seemed Todd leaves, you know, thing is there,

125
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.920
you're there trying to lower volatility in the short run,

126
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:52.180
but creating tail events and systems always evolve towards that.

127
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:53.140
And then you always crash.

128
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.850
Like the gas curve is the star low ramp

129
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.530
plateau crash. It's a hundred percent effective.

130
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.000
<v 0>In the long run.</v>
