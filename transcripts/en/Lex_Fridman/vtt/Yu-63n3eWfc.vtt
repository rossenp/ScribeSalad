00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.401
<v 0>Hello,</v>

2
00:00:03.401 --> 00:00:08.240
comrade &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt; so animal farm by,

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.840
uh, George Orwell is, uh, one of my favorite books.

4
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.080
It's an allegory about at least I think about the Soviet union and the

5
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:21.040
Russian revolution of 1917. So for people who haven't read it, it's,

6
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.390
uh, animals overthrow the humans and as slowly become as bad or worse

7
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.630
than the humans. So comrade,

8
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.830
if we lived on this farm in the book, animal farm,

9
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.790
which animal would you most rather be? Uh, would it be the pigs,

10
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.590
the horses, the donkey Benjamin, the Raven Moses,

11
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.300
the Mr. Mrs. Jones, the dogs or the sheep.

12
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.620
<v 1>Um, I'm gonna go with the Milton answer,</v>

13
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.980
which is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven. Right. It's.

14
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.700
<v 0>Better to rule in hell than serve in heaven. Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.180
<v 1>So I would have to go with the pigs. So I guess I'd be a cop, um.</v>

16
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.240
<v 0>At the very top.</v>

17
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.130
So the leader than main pig Napoleon versus like the snow ball of the others.

18
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.490
<v 1>Yeah. I, I would say it's not, it's,</v>

19
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.610
it's sure it's an algorithm of the Russian revolution, but I think, um,

20
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.610
Orwell's point was, this is broader towards most totalitarian dictatorships.

21
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.563
I mean, it, it,

22
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.290
it could very easily be reticent indictment of Moline or Hitler or many of these

23
00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:25.520
others. Uh, I'm a huge, um, George Orwell fan.

24
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.520
One of the things that I think people on the right need to appreciate is

25
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.360
the courage of many of these in undisputably left

26
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.800
wing voices who were the strongest ones to take on, uh, totalitarianism,

27
00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:41.080
totalitarian communism,

28
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.440
and the three I could think off the top of my head who are all in my top 10

29
00:01:44.441 --> 00:01:48.750
heroes of all time are Emma Goldman, uh, Al KMU, uh,

30
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.670
and Orwell being the third, you know, something that, uh,

31
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.910
leftists like to throw in the face of people on the right,

32
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.670
who constantly invoke Orwell is that Orwell said,

33
00:01:57.671 --> 00:01:59.830
and I don't have the exact quote off the top of my head with some,

34
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.390
to the effect of every word I have written is in,

35
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:04.990
should be taken as a defensive,

36
00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:09.060
democratic social wisdom against totalitarianism mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. So, uh,

37
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.780
people like Truman, you know, was obviously very hardcore in many ways,

38
00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:17.220
anti communist, uh, we like to parse things out.

39
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.100
Um, you're gonna laugh, uh, into binary fashions that, you know, left good,

40
00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:25.140
right. Bad, or right, good left bad. But historically speaking,

41
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.730
it was this not fall away into these camps as easily as people would like.

42
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.810
Um, and I think it is important for those of us. It takes a lot more courage,

43
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.450
um, to fight the right from the right or to fight the left from the left.

44
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:40.610
Because in a sense,

45
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.570
a lot of your countrymen or your fellow travelers are gonna regard you as a

46
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.200
trader to the cause. So I, I, every chance I get,

47
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.840
I will sing the praises of these three figures among others who not only,

48
00:02:52.841 --> 00:02:54.680
even if they hadn't done what they had done,

49
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.000
just lived just amazing lives that all of us can, uh,

50
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.960
learn from and admire and regard us somewhat, uh,

51
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.880
a role model. So.
