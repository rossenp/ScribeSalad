00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.180
<v 0>Our mutual friend,</v>

2
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.420
Andrew Huan mentioned something offline to me about something involving

3
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.140
the, the mob. Oh yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; is there,

4
00:00:12.141 --> 00:00:14.180
is there something you could share or is this, or,

5
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.380
or are people going to hurt if you share.

6
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.460
<v 1>This it's it's far enough in the rear view mirror. I mean, &lt;laugh&gt;,</v>

7
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.330
I was hired by this group in Sicily on, and this is,

8
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.130
you know, I was all of like 21 years old.

9
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.010
And to get a permit to work there,

10
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:34.810
you have to show that you have a competency that nobody else in Italy has mm-hmm

11
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:35.070
&lt;affirmative&gt;.

12
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.890
And that competency for Ona ol at the time was cheese expert &lt;laugh&gt;.

13
00:00:38.891 --> 00:00:39.610
So it was like,

14
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.450
it was like stupid American girl being like going to the consulate.

15
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.880
So I already knew that it was like,

16
00:00:43.881 --> 00:00:46.400
there was something wobbly about this organization, but, um,

17
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.440
I went to work for them.

18
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.653
<v 2>And, um,</v>

19
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.760
my boss from that time did end up in federal prison for corruption mm-hmm

20
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.520
&lt;affirmative&gt; um, many years later, um, embezzlement primarily,

21
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.120
but so I, I was definitely in an environment that was, um,

22
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.350
answering to multiple masters and that's nice way to put it.

23
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.990
<v 1>It was, it was, I, I couldn't have asked for a better way to,</v>

24
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.230
to kind of get with life and understand how things happen in the world though.

25
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.870
You know, of

26
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.190
learning as somebody who tends to be super direct and, um, not very subtle.

27
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.580
It was amazing to be in this world where like everybody communicates in multiple

28
00:01:26.581 --> 00:01:29.660
levels. Like my we're going to lunch with my boss,

29
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.300
with somebody we're gonna do a business deal with. And by the, the,

30
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.940
they ordered a glass of wine.

31
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.820
And with that order communicated like disappointment. Yeah.

32
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.060
Because that the father,

33
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.620
the person who had made that wine had offended that other guys, yeah.

34
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.570
I like the, that level of stuff where like nothing happened directly. I'm like,

35
00:01:47.571 --> 00:01:49.290
what are we talking about afterwards? I'm like, what happened at lunch?

36
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.730
It's like, oh, I just, you know, I told him this by ordering that, whatever,

37
00:01:52.731 --> 00:01:53.564
you know, that kind of thing.

38
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.770
So understanding that there's different ways of communicating. Um,

39
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.730
but it was also, you know, it, it, it was interesting to see.

40
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.770
And I think I, you know,

41
00:02:02.771 --> 00:02:05.170
it's kind of the struggle that I've lived again and again,

42
00:02:05.171 --> 00:02:06.640
in my life life fundamentally,

43
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.800
what we were doing in that operation was there's a very traditional cheese

44
00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:15.280
called the Ragano cheese in Southeast Sicily where I lived Raza. And, um,

45
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.040
it was about scaling that operation.

46
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.840
So it was European union money that my boss was also unfortunately using for

47
00:02:20.841 --> 00:02:22.680
other things. But fundamentally, yeah,

48
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.190
it was to take that this type of very small scaled cheese, get them exported,

49
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.670
help them scale. And we did it and it was really challenging.

50
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.110
And I learned a lot about the safety issues and collaboration issues and

51
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.350
creating groups of farmers for scale. So it's kind of been doing the same thing.

52
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.430
&lt;laugh&gt; like, again and again. Um, but Sicily, it, it, you know,

53
00:02:42.431 --> 00:02:46.940
it was also just the first place where I would regular really

54
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.060
forage for food. Yeah. You know,

55
00:02:50.061 --> 00:02:54.980
like there I'd go to friends' houses and we'd like go out and pick

56
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.020
nets or go out and pick Wallace Bargo.

57
00:02:57.021 --> 00:02:59.060
So every season there was stuff that you would be gathering.

58
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.520
And that was just part of how you lived mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and it was part of

59
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.040
your, your health. So that was,

60
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.000
that just learned a ton in that time about like simple eating and, and, and,

61
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.840
and, uh, really that healthy food,

62
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.160
the simpler it is the better, right?

63
00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:19.950
Like this sort of sense that healthy food is' in a tiny package, granola bar,

64
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.590
lots of labels, lots of powders. It's like the more simple, essential,

65
00:03:22.591 --> 00:03:24.750
closer the land can actually lead to optimal health.
