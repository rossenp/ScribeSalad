00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.910
<v 0>Well, can we, can we actually talk about the suffering? Sure.</v>

2
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.610
The darkest parts of writing a book.

3
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.380
So the let's let's go to the full Michael moule, Stephen King mode of,

4
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.440
uh, one of the darkest moments of writing this book.

5
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.270
And what does it maybe start the white pill? What's the idea. What's the hope.

6
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.060
And what are your darkest moments around writing this book?

7
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.920
<v 1>So people are familiar with the red pill and the blue pill. The,</v>

8
00:00:29.921 --> 00:00:31.610
the [inaudible] for the matrix,

9
00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:36.560
the red pill is the idea that what is presented as fact by the corporate press

10
00:00:36.561 --> 00:00:38.450
entertainment industry is in fact,

11
00:00:38.451 --> 00:00:41.480
a carefully constructed narrative designed to keep some very unpleasant people

12
00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:43.730
in power and everyone else under control.

13
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.360
And I guess one of my expressions is you take one red pill,

14
00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:48.590
not the whole bottle. Yeah.

15
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.380
Because at a certain point you think everything's a lie and then you're,

16
00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:54.590
you're kind of no capacity for distinguishing truth.

17
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.870
<v 0>You're full good. One-liners well, thank you.</v>

18
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.000
<v 1>Yeah, I'm full of something. That's for sure.</v>

19
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.490
And what I saw in this space is a lot of these

20
00:01:04.491 --> 00:01:07.370
red pill, people got very, um,

21
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.040
disheartened and cynical.

22
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.850
And one of my big heroes is Albert Khumbu and he said,

23
00:01:13.851 --> 00:01:18.500
the worst thing is citizens. And that's led something called the black pill,

24
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.250
which is the idea that, you know, it's, it's all it's, it's, it's just,

25
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.980
we're waiting for the end. It's hopeless.

26
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.500
And I don't see it that way at all. And I'm like,

27
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.680
all right, I have to address this.

28
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.320
And not just with some kind of cheerleading,

29
00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:40.880
everything's going to be great guys. Here is why I am positive.

30
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.130
And not that I'm positive, the good guys you're going to win, but I'm positive.

31
00:01:46.131 --> 00:01:47.750
The good guys can win.

32
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.280
And that's all you need because if your God forbid,

33
00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:56.900
kid is kidnapped and there's a 10% chance that you can save them.

34
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.300
You're not going to be like, wow, I don't like those odds. This is your country.

35
00:02:02.301 --> 00:02:07.010
This is your values. This is your family. Uh, I think it's a much more than 10%.

36
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.080
And even if you lose,

37
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.150
you will take pride in that you did everything in your power to win.

38
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.350
So is there a good.

39
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.670
<v 0>Definition of good guys in the sense that once you wear white</v>

40
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.710
there's layers to this you're like modern day Shakespeare.

41
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.010
Is there a danger in thinking, um, uh, at all,

42
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.900
Hitler was probably pretty confident that he

43
00:02:35.901 --> 00:02:37.100
led a group of good guys.

44
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.620
<v 1>Listen, if Hitler did anything wrong, why isn't he in jail?</v>

45
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.880
A Czech friend thought of that.

46
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.230
<v 0>He actually, he says that his accident goes in. It learns so bad.</v>

47
00:02:48.231 --> 00:02:52.640
Why isn't he in jail? Yeah, that's a good point.

48
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.510
He's probably still alive, right? Yeah. Hopefully.

49
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.050
Oh boy. Two of the three people listening to this are very upset, right?
