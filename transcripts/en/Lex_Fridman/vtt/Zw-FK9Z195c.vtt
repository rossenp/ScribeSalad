00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.170
<v 0>Do you think Jeffrey Epstein killed himself? No,</v>

2
00:00:06.171 --> 00:00:10.610
I think he was killed by that guy. That, that, that, that guy,

3
00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:14.750
that they put in a cell that Luna tech, uh, who's that big muscled guy.

4
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.730
I think he was just, he did it for money.

5
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.870
Kept his mouth shut that's money from whom do you think Massaad?

6
00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:22.850
Am I six CIA or three?

7
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.390
So there's a lot of pressure from a lot of different profitably,

8
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.780
probably massaged CIA more. I mean,

9
00:00:29.781 --> 00:00:34.130
it seems clear that he was working inside of a honeypot intelligence operation,

10
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.700
just land Maxwell's father was in Israeli, super spy, uh,

11
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.030
just lame Maxwell's working for Israeli intelligence. It would be odd to think.

12
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.240
And of course the CIA knows about everything that Israeli intelligence is doing

13
00:00:44.241 --> 00:00:47.420
with Americans. So, uh, I would think that, uh,

14
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.050
it's a very cozy relationship with those two intelligence agencies. And, uh,

15
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.840
I think if you ran it by anyone, I think if you ran it by French intelligence,

16
00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:55.730
they'd go, yeah, no, get, get it up.

17
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.150
I don't think there was any intelligence service in the world whose job was to

18
00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:02.000
protect the powerful people that live in their countries that was against him

19
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:02.834
getting whacked.

20
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.460
But do you think it's possible that he's just an evil person who is after

21
00:01:07.461 --> 00:01:12.440
manipulating people and also was it well, so that there's a bigger thing,

22
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.880
factual, that there's a bigger thing. Evil people don't get has a, your facts,

23
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.660
Tim Dylan. No, there's no facts of the case you don't get. That is 65.

24
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.120
Show me another evil guy who was handed a $65 million, uh, uh,

25
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.780
place by Les Wexner.

26
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.760
Show me another evil guy that got that type of a handshake deal,

27
00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:35.090
where he was basically, uh, let off without anything.

28
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.010
After a judge had made a very sweetheart deal for him after he

29
00:01:40.011 --> 00:01:44.750
was accused of molesting a 14 year old, show me another evil guy that,

30
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.230
uh, doesn't have that kind of backing that has those types of friends,

31
00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:51.320
those connections, those type of properties. Show me, uh, you know,

32
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.300
multiple passports all over the world.

33
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.680
So show me a guy without anyone backing him, that's doing it. Why didn't they,

34
00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.970
you know, you think he's just a,

35
00:01:58.971 --> 00:02:03.380
an evil guys who was doing this for whom it's his own, just and giggles.

36
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.770
He's just got it. Hang off on it. Human nature, human nature. Huh?

37
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.660
It's human nature. Right? $70 million, uh, limestone man. Yeah.

38
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.950
Is it human nature? And it's, I don't think it's human nature. I think it's,

39
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.220
I think it's, I think they manipulated human nature, but I think they,

40
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.930
I think they did it. I think just laying back,

41
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.620
I think Epstein was really just a functionary and I think just lane was kind of

42
00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:28.820
a pimp and Epstein was kind of a guy that, you know, made the money. Okay. And,

43
00:02:28.821 --> 00:02:30.560
you know, hid money and things like that.

44
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.540
And worked for a lot of powerful people.

45
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.900
I don't believe in lone pedophiles anymore.

46
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.500
I don't even believe that if you're a pedophile you're like in a group,

47
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.540
you know what I mean?
