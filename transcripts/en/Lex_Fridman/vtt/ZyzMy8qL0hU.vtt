00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.700
<v 0>Can you say something to the history of alchemy.</v>

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.740
<v 1>A little bit and its impact? Sure. Um,</v>

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.700
it used to be thought two things, one that alchemy,

4
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.380
which dates certainly back to the Islamic period in Islam, uh,

5
00:00:20.381 --> 00:00:25.050
you're talking, you know, 11th, 12th of 18th centuries, uh,

6
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.050
among Islamic natural philosophers and experimenters. Uh,

7
00:00:29.051 --> 00:00:31.770
but it used to be thought that, um, alchemy,

8
00:00:31.771 --> 00:00:36.530
which picked up strikingly in the 15th, 16th century,

9
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.490
15 hundreds in thereabouts, uh,

10
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.280
was a sort of mystical procedure involving all sorts of

11
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:46.000
strange notions and so on.

12
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.160
<v 2>And that's not entirely untrue,</v>

13
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.280
but it is substantially untrue in that alchemists were

14
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.680
engaged in what, uh,

15
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.000
was known as Chris O Poya that is looking for ways to

16
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.800
transform, um,

17
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.230
invaluable materials into valuable ones mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but

18
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.070
in the process of doing so or attempting to do so,

19
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.870
they learned how to, uh,

20
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.870
create complex amalgams of various kinds.

21
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.260
They used very elaborate apparatus limbics in

22
00:01:26.261 --> 00:01:30.260
which they would use heat to produce chemical decompositions.

23
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.980
<v 1>They would write down and observe these compositions.</v>

24
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.140
And many of the so-called really strange looking out chemical formulas and

25
00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:42.460
statements where they'll say something like, I, I can't produce it,

26
00:01:42.461 --> 00:01:47.010
but it'd be the soul of Mars combine with the,

27
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.650
this et cetera, et cetera. These,

28
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.250
it has been shown are almost all actual formulas for how

29
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.490
to engage in the production of complex amalgams mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and what to

30
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.483
do.

31
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.570
And by the time of Newton Newton was reading the works of a,

32
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.120
a, uh, fellow by the name of Starky who was actually came from Harvard,

33
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.120
uh, uh, shortly before in which, um,

34
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.640
things had progressed, if you will,

35
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.480
to the point where the procedure turns into what historians called Christ OPO,

36
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.110
which basically runs in to the notion of thinking that maybe

37
00:02:29.111 --> 00:02:30.990
these things are made outta particles,

38
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.550
this is the mechanical philosophy. Can we engage in processes,

39
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.750
chemical processes to rearrange these things, which is not so stupid after all?

40
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.310
I mean, we do it except we happen to do it in reactors, not in chemical process,

41
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.700
these unless of course it had happened that cold fusion had worked,

42
00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:55.500
which it didn't, um, not yet. Well, right. But, um,

43
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.300
so that's the way they're thinking about these things.

44
00:02:58.301 --> 00:03:03.280
There's a kind of mix and Newton engages extensively in those sorts

45
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.000
of manipulations. In fact,

46
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.480
more in that than almost anything else, uh,

47
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.440
except for his optical investigations.

48
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.160
If you look through the latter parts of the 1670s,

49
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.840
the last 5, 6,

50
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.270
7 years or so of that is more on that than there is on

51
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.750
anything else he's not working on mechanics.

52
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.110
He's pretty much gone pretty far in optics.

53
00:03:28.111 --> 00:03:30.070
He'll turn back to optics later on.

54
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.070
<v 0>So optics and alchemy.</v>

55
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.670
So well you're saying is Isaac Newton liked shiny things?

56
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.820
<v 1>Well, actually, if you go on and look at what bill Newman,</v>

57
00:03:40.821 --> 00:03:45.180
the professor in Indiana, uh, at Bloomington Indiana has produced,

58
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.980
you'll find the very shiny thing called the star reus,

59
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.980
which Newton describes as having produced according to a particular way,

60
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.060
which Newman figured out and was able to do it. And it's very shiny.

61
00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:58.380
&lt;laugh&gt; there.

62
00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.530
<v 0>You go. Proves the, the, yeah.</v>
