00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.580
<v 0>Time, crystals. Yeah. Um, what are they? These things are,</v>

2
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.620
it's a very beautiful idea when we start to, um, treat space and time

3
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.460
as, um, similar frameworks. Yes. Right.

4
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.300
<v 1>Physical phenomenon. Right. That's what motivated it. What.</v>

5
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.090
<v 0>Are first of all? What are crystals? Yeah. And what time crystals. Okay. So.</v>

6
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.370
<v 1>Crystals are orderly arrangements of, uh,</v>

7
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.530
atoms in space and, uh, many materials,

8
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.050
if you cool them down gently, uh,

9
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.040
will form crystals. And so we say that that's, uh, a,

10
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.320
a, a state of matter that forms spontaneously and, uh,

11
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.280
an important feature of that state of matter is that the end

12
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.800
result, the crystal, uh,

13
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.830
has less symmetry than the equations that give

14
00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:08.630
rise to the crystal. So the equations,

15
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.270
the basic equations of physics, uh,

16
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.510
are the same if you, uh, move a little bit,

17
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.950
so you can move the homogeneous,

18
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.950
but crystals aren't atoms are in particular place. So they have less symmetry.

19
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.380
Uh, and time crystals are the same thing in time.

20
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.020
&lt;laugh&gt; that basically you, you, but of course it's not,

21
00:01:32.021 --> 00:01:36.540
so it's not positions of atoms, but it's ordering, uh,

22
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.060
orderly behavior, uh, that certain states of matter,

23
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.970
uh, will arrange themselves into spontaneously. If you do them, if you,

24
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.450
if you treat them gently and let them do what they want to do, but in.

25
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.490
<v 0>Repeat in that same way, indefinitely, that's.</v>

26
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.770
<v 1>The crystal inform. You can also have, uh, uh,</v>

27
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.410
time liquids or you can have all kinds of other states of matter.

28
00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:05.370
You don't have space time crystals where the pattern only repeats if,

29
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.040
uh, with each step of time, you also move at a certain,

30
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.400
a certain direction and space. And so, so, yeah, so,

31
00:02:12.401 --> 00:02:17.240
but it's op it's basically it's states of matter that,

32
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.960
uh, oh, base that display structure in time spontaneously.

33
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.950
<v 0>So here's, here's the difference when it happens in into time? Uh,</v>

34
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.390
it sure looks a lot like it's motion and if it repeats indefinitely,

35
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.430
it sure looks a lot like perpetual motion. Yeah. Like, uh,

36
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.990
looks like free lunch &lt;laugh&gt; and I,

37
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.230
I was told that there's no such thing as free lunch. Does,

38
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.230
does this violate laws of thermodynamics? Uh.

39
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.203
<v 1>No. No,</v>

40
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.180
but it requires a critical examination of the laws of thermodynamics. I mean,

41
00:02:52.181 --> 00:02:52.660
let me,

42
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.580
let me say on background that the laws of thermodynamics are not the

43
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.520
not fundamental laws of physics. There are things we prove

44
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.280
under certain circumstances emerge from the fundamental laws of physics, right?

45
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.680
They're not, we don't PO them separately.

46
00:03:10.681 --> 00:03:14.400
They're meant to be deduced and they can be deduced under limited circumstances,

47
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.720
but not necessarily universally.

48
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:21.150
And we've found finding some of subtleties and sort of accept edge cases,

49
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.870
uh, where they don't apply in a straightforward way. Uh,

50
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.030
and this is one, uh,

51
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.750
so time crystals do obey do have this structure in time,

52
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.420
but it's not a free lunch because although in a sense, things are moving,

53
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.020
uh, they're they're already doing what they want to do. They're in their living.

54
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.660
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. So if, if you want to extract energy from it,

55
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.580
you're gonna be foiled because there's no spare energy there, you, uh,

56
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.140
uh, it it's or so you, you can add energy to it and kind of disturb it, but,

57
00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.960
but, uh,

58
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.490
you can't and extract energy from this motion because it's gonna,

59
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.850
it wants to do that's the lowest energy configuration that there is. So you,

60
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.650
you can't get further energy out of it. So in theory.

61
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.170
<v 0>I guess, perpetual motion, uh,</v>

62
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.330
you would be able to extract energy from it. Yes. If,

63
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.400
if such a thing was to be created, you can then mill a good.

64
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.360
<v 1>For energy. What's what's usually meant in the literature.</v>

65
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.480
Perpetual motion is

66
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.680
a kind of macroscopic motion that you could extract energy from. And,

67
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.120
and somehow it would crank back up, right? That's that's not the case here.

68
00:04:39.121 --> 00:04:43.430
If you wanna extract energy, you, uh, this motion is,

69
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.070
is not something you can extract energy from.

70
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.230
If you intervene in the behavior, you can, uh, change it,

71
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.430
but only by injecting energy, not, not by taking away energy.
