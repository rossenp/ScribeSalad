WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:04.970
<v 0>So we were offline talking about</v>

2
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.290
Stalin and, uh,

3
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.620
the evils of the Soviet regime. Yeah.

4
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.330
One of the things I mentioned, I watched the movie, uh, Mr. Jones,

5
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.190
but it's about the 1930s called the more the,

6
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.940
what would you say? The torture of the Ukrainian people? Yeah.

7
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.630
By Stalin one interesting thing to me,

8
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.790
I'd love to hear your opinion about is the role of journalism in all of this,

9
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.770
and also about 1930s Germany.

10
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.110
So what's the role of journalists and intellectuals

11
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.590
in a time when trouble is brewing,

12
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.150
but it requires a really sort of

13
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.320
brave and deep thinking to understand that trouble is brewing.

14
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.540
Like if you were a journalist or if you were just like an intellectual,

15
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.950
a thinker. Sure. But also a voice of, uh, in the,

16
00:01:05.951 --> 00:01:07.340
in the space of public discourse,

17
00:01:07.341 --> 00:01:11.420
what would you do in 1930s about Stalin,

18
00:01:11.421 --> 00:01:12.350
about how the more,

19
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.790
and what would you do about Nazi Germany in 1937,

20
00:01:16.791 --> 00:01:17.900
1938.

21
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.380
<v 1>So that's really funny that you asked that because currently how the book is</v>

22
00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:25.970
structured, it's like, you know, books often follow a three X structure, right?

23
00:01:25.971 --> 00:01:27.710
So act three is the eighties act.

24
00:01:27.711 --> 00:01:31.880
One is the thirties and act two is going to be like, all right,

25
00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:35.360
let's suppose you were in the thirties. Are you just going to give up? Like,

26
00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:38.510
are you just going to be like, well, we're screwed and you'd be right to say,

27
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.280
things are going to be very loud for a long time.

28
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.670
Or are you going to be one of those few who are like,

29
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.710
we're going to do something about this. And you know,

30
00:01:45.711 --> 00:01:48.680
we're going to go down swinging. There are two books I can recommend,

31
00:01:48.681 --> 00:01:53.330
which are just masterpieces, that, that are written by women.

32
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.700
Um, that just are historians that are just superb.

33
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.070
There's a book called beyond belief by Deborah Lipstadt.

34
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.230
She talks about the rise of Nazi Germany as seen through the press and what

35
00:02:03.231 --> 00:02:04.130
was amazing.

36
00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:07.190
And she's does a great job empathizing with the press and understand their

37
00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:10.730
perspective is we remember and Chamberlain gets a bad rap,

38
00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:14.690
Neville Chamberlain for kind of appeasing Hitler, because not that long ago,

39
00:02:14.691 --> 00:02:15.530
they had the great war.

40
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.570
They had world war one and they had the carnage that the earth had never

41
00:02:20.571 --> 00:02:23.700
seen before. And when you had people made out of meat,

42
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.440
meaning industrial machines and plastic surgery was invented as a consequence of

43
00:02:27.441 --> 00:02:30.200
this they're coming back mangled and disfigured and for what,

44
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.180
and this was a world where the Kaiser was the most evil person who ever lived.

45
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.770
And we all had the Western propaganda about the Hahn and all the rapes and all

46
00:02:39.771 --> 00:02:41.600
this barbarism and blah, blah, blah.

47
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.850
So not that long later when you're hearing all this propaganda,

48
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.390
which was factual about Hitler, it's like, we heard this,

49
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.130
we heard this 20 years ago, this was all lies. Give us some,

50
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.120
give us a break.

51
00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.630
And she has all the quotes from the different agencies and

52
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:04.120
how they address their plus. They had very limited information.

53
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:04.931
It's not like Nazi,

54
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:09.070
Germany was an open society where reporters can walk around and they were under

55
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:11.680
a lot of pressure as well. You know, in those areas.

56
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.170
<v 0>Hitler himself was pretty good at, uh, he let some stuff slip,</v>

57
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.850
but usually he made it seem like he wants peace. He wants world peace. This one.

58
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.511
<v 1>It's amazing.</v>

59
00:03:21.511 --> 00:03:25.140
They were making the argument that because all these Jews were being beaten up

60
00:03:25.141 --> 00:03:25.974
on the street,

61
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.180
this proved this was the hot take of the day that Hitler was weak

62
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.370
because since Hitler's a statesman and he can't control these hooligans that

63
00:03:35.371 --> 00:03:37.680
shows his control and power is tenuous.

64
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.600
And this is all going to go away by the way.

65
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.580
<v 0>I mean, Hitler thought that too,</v>

66
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.610
he was kind of afraid of the bronchitis or whatever.

67
00:03:44.611 --> 00:03:46.950
Like he was afraid of these hooligans a little bit.

68
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.270
Like there were useful to him, but like at a certain point, like, yeah,

69
00:03:51.271 --> 00:03:52.770
they can get in the way. Yeah.

70
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.770
That's why he wanted to get control of the military, the army,

71
00:03:55.771 --> 00:03:58.500
like their regiment. Like if you want to take over the world,

72
00:03:58.501 --> 00:04:01.380
you can't do it with hooligans. Right. You have to do it with an actual.

73
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.010
<v 1>Sure. Army. And then you had Kristallnacht, which was a nationwide pogrom.</v>

74
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.410
And then all the news agencies universally were like, Oh crap.

75
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.190
We were, we, we got this wrong. And the condemnation was universal.

76
00:04:14.191 --> 00:04:16.410
So that book traces, uh,

77
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.360
the West reaction to what's going on there and including the reaction to the,

78
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.350
uh, incipient Holocaust as people being, you know, what they knew,

79
00:04:25.351 --> 00:04:29.550
when did they know there was not ambiguity about it? People,

80
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.420
I think there's this myth that she dispels that piece,

81
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.690
that they didn't know the Holocaust was happening, where they didn't care.

82
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.080
They were aware, but they were already at war with Nazi Germany.

83
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.370
Like what literally, what else could they do at that point? Um, you know, to,

84
00:04:44.371 --> 00:04:49.110
to rescue all these Jews. So, so th that's the super book and Anne Applebaum,

85
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.670
I think the book is called red famine came out fairly recently and

86
00:04:53.671 --> 00:04:58.230
she brings the receipts and she's, uh, you know,

87
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.170
this is something I really hate with the binary thinkers,

88
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.750
where the people think, Oh, you know, if you're a Democrat,

89
00:05:03.751 --> 00:05:06.750
you're basically a communist. They call Joe Biden, the Marxist. It's just like,

90
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.300
you know, she's a hard left day. She's, you know, has TDS,

91
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.010
but this book just systemically lays out what Stalin did.

92
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.850
<v 0>By the way. I'm triggered by the binary thinkers. And for those who don't know,</v>

93
00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:21.900
TDS zero, zero one, one is a Trump derangement syndrome. Yes.

94
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.790
<v 1>So they, you know, forced to starvation its entire population.</v>

95
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.970
And they, it's not only that,

96
00:05:29.971 --> 00:05:34.920
it's like they knew if you weren't starving by looking at you that you

97
00:05:34.921 --> 00:05:35.880
were hiding food.

98
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.590
So then come back to your house at night and break your fingers in the door or

99
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:41.850
take burn down your house.

100
00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.220
And now you're on the street without food because you lied.

101
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.160
Cause this is the people's food. You're a, Kulak, you're a landowner.

102
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.640
And very quickly a Kulak which meant like peasant landowner became anyone who

103
00:05:50.641 --> 00:05:54.900
had a piece of bread and it was systemic and ongoing.

104
00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.200
And many people in the press did not believe it. Uh,

105
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:04.670
there was a, um, a British journalist, I believe who got out of the train, uh,

106
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.420
Ukraine,

107
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.830
like one town earlier and walked and he described all this and he was mocked and

108
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:12.680
derided. And this is just anti-Russian propaganda.

109
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.480
Because at the time in the thirties,

110
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:18.410
this was socialism had come through fruition. This was a noble experiment.

111
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.900
I'd seen the future. And it works. I think, uh,

112
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.500
Sydney web was the guy who said that. And the premise was,

113
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.340
let's see what happens. We've never tried something like that.

114
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.110
And they were perfectly happy to have this experiment happen overseas at the

115
00:06:33.111 --> 00:06:36.110
price of the Russian people, because it's like, you know what,

116
00:06:36.111 --> 00:06:39.200
maybe this will be paradise on earth. And there's a,

117
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.650
I address this in my book as well. There's suburb essay,

118
00:06:42.651 --> 00:06:46.640
I think by Eugene Genovese. And, uh, he talks about the question,

119
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.810
the question being, what did you know? And when did you know it,

120
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.090
what did you know about the concentration camps?

121
00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:55.280
What did you know about the starvation? What'd, you know,

122
00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:58.400
about children being taught at school to turn in their parents were, you know,

123
00:06:58.401 --> 00:07:03.320
having some extra bread and his conclusion is we all knew and we all knew from

124
00:07:03.321 --> 00:07:04.640
the beginning, every bit of it.

125
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.810
And we didn't care because we were more interested in promoting this ideology.

126
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.870
So when people are kind of thinking,

127
00:07:11.871 --> 00:07:14.660
the worst thing on earth is like Robert E.

128
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.090
Lee statue being taken out of Washington, DC.

129
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.910
We were being told on a,

130
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.260
an especially a much more limited news information world,

131
00:07:24.261 --> 00:07:26.450
where now you have literally anyone have a Twitter,

132
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:31.100
but how many outlets were there that this is, uh, we're backwards.

133
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.580
They're the future they're scientific. We have the vagaries of the market,

134
00:07:34.581 --> 00:07:35.870
which led to the great depression.

135
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:41.090
And when you see what was being put over on the American public at the time, um,

136
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.150
anyone who thinks things are as bad now, as they ever,

137
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.610
ever been is simply delusional or ignorant.
