1
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.850
<v 0>You founded the payment system Braintree in 2007,</v>

2
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.210
that acquired Venmo in, uh, 2012. In that,

3
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.610
in that same year was acquired by PayPal, which is now eBay.

4
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.450
Can you tell me the story, uh,

5
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.040
of the vision and the challenge of building an online in system and just

6
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.040
building a large successful business? In general.

7
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.880
<v 1>I discovered payments by accident as I was, when I was 21.</v>

8
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.200
I, I just returned from Ecuador, uh, living among extreme poverty for two years.

9
00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:42.560
And I came back to the us and I was shocked by the opulence and

10
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.610
yeah. Of the United States. And I just thought, this is, I couldn't believe it.

11
00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:51.770
And I just decided I wanted to try to spend my life helping others.

12
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.050
Like that was the,

13
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.530
that was a life objective that I thought was worthwhile to pursue versus making

14
00:00:56.531 --> 00:00:59.210
money and whatever the case may be, uh, for its own. Right.

15
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.480
And so I decided that moment that I was going to try to make enough money you by

16
00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:06.720
the age of 30 to never have to work again.

17
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.400
And then with some abundance of money,

18
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.400
I could then choose to do things that might be beneficial to others,

19
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.000
but may not meet the criteria of being, you know, a standalone business.

20
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.320
And so in that process, I started a few companies,

21
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.590
had some small successes, had some, uh, failure in one of the endeavors.

22
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.550
I was up to my eyeballs in debt. Things were not going well.

23
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.590
And I needed a part-time job to pay my bills. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. And so I,

24
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.750
one day I saw in, in the paper in Utah,

25
00:01:38.751 --> 00:01:41.030
where I was living the 50 riches people in Utah,

26
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.990
and I emailed each one of their assistants and said, you know, I I'm young,

27
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.100
I'm resourceful. I'll do anything. I'll just wanna I'm entrepreneurial.

28
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.580
I try to get a job that would be flexible and no one responded.

29
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.860
And then I interviewed at a few dozen places.

30
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.740
Nobody would even give me the time of day, uh, like, well,

31
00:01:59.741 --> 00:02:03.340
no one take me seriously. And so finally, I, it was on monster.com,

32
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.450
but I saw this job posting for credit card sales door to door

33
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.770
commission. &lt;laugh&gt; I did not.

34
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.560
<v 0>Know the story.</v>

35
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.410
<v 1>This is great. I love the head drop. That's exactly right. So it was, uh.</v>

36
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.370
<v 0>The low points to which would go in.</v>

37
00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.290
<v 1>Like &lt;laugh&gt;. So I, I responded and, you know,</v>

38
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.730
the person made an attempt at suggesting that they had some kind of standards

39
00:02:25.731 --> 00:02:27.520
that, that they would consider hiring.

40
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.360
But it's kinda like if you could fog a mirror,

41
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.800
like come and do this because it's a hundred percent commission.

42
00:02:32.801 --> 00:02:36.800
And so I started walking up and down the street in my community selling credit

43
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.320
card processing. And so what you learn immediately in doing that is if you,

44
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.720
you walk into a business, first of all,

45
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.230
the business owner is typically there it's and you walk in the door and they can

46
00:02:48.231 --> 00:02:49.550
tell by how you're dressed or how you walk,

47
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:50.910
whatever their pattern recognition is.

48
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.230
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and they just hate you immediately.

49
00:02:53.231 --> 00:02:55.830
It's like stop wasting my time. I really am trying to get stuff done.

50
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:56.950
I don't wanna listen to a sales pitch.

51
00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.320
And so you have to overcome the initial get out. And then once you engage,

52
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.040
when you say the word credit card processing, the person's like,

53
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.640
I already hate you because I have been taken advantage of dozens of times

54
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:12.640
because you all are yeah. Weasel.

55
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.160
And so I had to figure out an algorithm to get past all those different

56
00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:18.910
conditions. Cause I was still working on my other startup. Yeah. Uh,

57
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:20.790
for the majority of my time I was doing this part-time.

58
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.270
And so I figured out that the industry really was built on

59
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.750
people, uh, on deceit. Uh,

60
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:33.950
basically people prompted things that, that were not reality.

61
00:03:33.951 --> 00:03:35.310
And so I'd walk into a business, I'd say, look,

62
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.390
I will give you a hundred dollars. I'd put a hundred dollars bill and say,

63
00:03:38.391 --> 00:03:40.460
I will give you a a hundred dollars for three minutes of your time.

64
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.980
If you don't say yes to what I'm saying, I'll give you a hundred dollars.

65
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.500
And then he usually crack a smile and say, okay, what, what he got for me son.

66
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.260
And so I'd sit down and I'd just open my book and I'd say,

67
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.220
here's the credit card industry. Here's how it works. Here are the players.

68
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.660
Here's what they do. Here's how they deceive you. Here's what I am.

69
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.460
I'm no different than anyone else. I it's like,

70
00:03:58.461 --> 00:03:59.380
you're gonna process your credit card.

71
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.530
Are you gonna get the money in the account?

72
00:04:00.531 --> 00:04:01.890
You're just gonna get a clean statement.

73
00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:05.130
You're gonna have someone who answers the call when someone asks and you know,

74
00:04:05.131 --> 00:04:08.290
just like the basic, like you're okay. Yeah. And people started saying yes.

75
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.290
And then of course, I went to the next business and be like, you know,

76
00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.090
Joe and Susie and whoever said yes to.

77
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:16.890
And so I built the social proof structure and I became the number one

78
00:04:16.891 --> 00:04:21.760
salesperson out of 400 people nationwide doing this. And I worked,

79
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.000
you know, half time still doing other startup. And that's a brilliant strategy.

80
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.720
<v 0>By the way. It's very well, very well strategized and.</v>

81
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.320
<v 1>Executed. I did it for nine months.</v>

82
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.600
And at the time my customer base was making was generating around.

83
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.750
I think it was six. If I remember correctly, 62,500, $4 a month. Mm-hmm,

84
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.110
&lt;affirmative&gt; where the overall revenues I thought, wow, that's amazing.

85
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.310
If I built that as my own company,

86
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.310
I would just make $62,000 a month of income passively with these merchants

87
00:04:53.311 --> 00:04:56.990
processing credit cards. So I thought, Hmm. And so, uh,

88
00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.110
that's when I thought I'm gonna create a company.

89
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.940
And so then I started brain and the idea was the

90
00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:08.660
online world was broken because PayPal had a, uh,

91
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.940
had been acquired by eBay around I think 2000,

92
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.700
1999 or 2000 and eBay had not innovated much with PayPal. So it,

93
00:05:15.701 --> 00:05:19.980
it basically sat still for seven years as the software world moved along

94
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.250
and then authorized.net. It was also a company that was relatively stagnant.

95
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.130
So you basically had software engineers who wanted modern payment tools,

96
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.130
but there were none available for them. And so they just dealt with software.

97
00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:31.970
They didn't like. And so with Braintree,

98
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.410
I thought the entry point is to build software that engineers will love.

99
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.490
And if we can find the entry point via software,

100
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.250
make it easy and beautiful and just a magical experience and then provide

101
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.640
customer service on top. Top of that, that was easy. That would be great.

102
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.640
What I was really going after for though was it was PayPal.

103
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.480
They were the only company in payments making money, uh, because they,

104
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.560
because they had the relationship with eBay early on,

105
00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.120
people created a PayPal account,

106
00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.600
they'd fund their account with their checking account versus their credit cards.

107
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.920
And then when they'd use PayPal to pay a merchant,

108
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.120
PayPal had a cost of payment of zero. Versus if you have, uh,

109
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:10.520
coming from a credit card, you have to pay the bank to fees.

110
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.400
So PayPal's margins were 3% on a transaction

111
00:06:15.401 --> 00:06:17.070
versus a typical payments company,

112
00:06:17.071 --> 00:06:19.470
which may be a nickel or a penny or a dime or something like that.

113
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:20.410
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

114
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.870
And so I knew a new PayPal really was the model to replicate,

115
00:06:23.871 --> 00:06:25.910
but a bunch of companies had tried to do that.

116
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:27.950
They tried to come in and build a two-sided marketplace.

117
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.870
So get consumers to fund the checking account and then merchants to accept it.

118
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.231
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

119
00:06:32.231 --> 00:06:36.150
but they'd all failed because building a two-sided marketplace is very hard at

120
00:06:36.151 --> 00:06:38.140
the same time. So my plan was,

121
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.620
I'm going to build a company and get the best merchants in the whole world to

122
00:06:42.621 --> 00:06:46.140
use our service. Then in year five, I'm going to have,

123
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.220
I'm going to acquire a consumer payments company and I'm going to bring the two

124
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.860
together. Wow. And so focus on the merchant side. Exactly.

125
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.180
And then get the payments.

126
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.850
<v 0>Company that does the, the customer, the what I of.</v>

127
00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.810
<v 1>The, the other side of it. This is the planet presented, uh,</v>

128
00:07:01.811 --> 00:07:04.330
when I was at the university of Chicago and

129
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.430
weirdly it happened exactly like that. So four,

130
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.870
four years in our customer base included Uber, Airbnb, GitHub,

131
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.270
uh, 37 signals now base camp.

132
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.620
We had a fantastic collection of company that represented

133
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.180
the fastest growing some of the fastest growing tech companies in the world.

134
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.780
And then we met up with Venmo and they had done a remarkable job

135
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.300
in building product. Then something very counterintuitive,

136
00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:34.940
which is make public your private financial transactions,

137
00:07:34.941 --> 00:07:38.700
which people previously thought were something that should be hidden from others

138
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:43.450
&lt;affirmative&gt; and we acquired Venmo. And at that point, we now had,

139
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:48.170
we replicated the model cause now people could fund their Venmo account with

140
00:07:48.171 --> 00:07:49.810
their checking account, keep money in the account.

141
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.930
And then you could just plug Venmo as a form of payment.

142
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.370
And so I think PayPal saw that,

143
00:07:55.371 --> 00:07:57.770
that we were getting the best merchants in the world.

144
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.480
We had people using Venmo.

145
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:04.360
They were both the up and coming millennials at the time who had so much

146
00:08:04.361 --> 00:08:08.160
influence online. And so they came in and offered us, uh,

147
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.760
an attractive number. And my,

148
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:16.200
my goal was not to build the biggest payments company in the world.

149
00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.440
It wasn't to try to climb the Forbes billionaire list.

150
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.190
It was the objective was I want to earn enough money

151
00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:29.350
so that I can basically dedicate my attention to doing something that

152
00:08:29.351 --> 00:08:33.350
could potentially be useful on a society wide skill.

153
00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:35.870
And, um, more importantly,

154
00:08:35.871 --> 00:08:40.230
that could be considered to be valuable from the vanish point of

155
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.980
twenty fifty, twenty one hundred and twenty five hundred.

156
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.420
So thinking about it on a, a few hundred year time scale,

157
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.340
and there was a certain amount of money I needed to do that.

158
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.920
So I didn't require the permission of anybody to do that.

159
00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.120
And so that what PayPal offered was sufficient for me to,

160
00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.440
to get that amount of money to basically have a go. And that's when I set off to

161
00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.320
survey everything,

162
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.680
I could identify in existence to say of anything in the entire world I could do,

163
00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:15.310
what one thing could I do that would actually have the value

164
00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.630
potential for the species. And so it took me a little while to,

165
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.150
to arrive at brainer faces, but.

166
00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:22.950
<v 0>You know,</v>

167
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:27.550
payments in themselves are revolutionary mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;

168
00:09:27.551 --> 00:09:31.470
technologies that can change the world. Like let's not,

169
00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:37.180
let's not, uh, sort of, um, let's not forget that too easily. I mean,

170
00:09:37.181 --> 00:09:40.780
obviously, you know this, but there's, um,

171
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:47.100
quite a few lovely folks who are now fascinated with

172
00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.900
the space of cryptocurrency mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and, uh,

173
00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.980
where payments are very much connected to this, but in general, just money. And,

174
00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.170
uh, many of, of the folks I've, I've spoken with,

175
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.970
they also kind of connect that to not just purely financial discussions,

176
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:05.410
but philosophical and political discussions. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and, uh,

177
00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:09.570
they see Bitcoin as a way almost as activism

178
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.450
almost as a way to resist mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; the, uh,

179
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:17.320
the corruption of centralized of centers of power mm-hmm and sort of basically

180
00:10:17.321 --> 00:10:19.680
in the 21st century decentralized control,

181
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:22.200
whether that's Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies,

182
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:26.320
they see that's one possible way to give

183
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:31.360
power to those that live in, uh, regimes that are corrupt or,

184
00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.640
uh, are not respectful, human rights and all those kinds of things.

185
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.510
What's your sense? Just all your expertise with,

186
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.070
with payments and seeing how that changed the world.

187
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:46.030
What's your sense about the lay of the land for the future of

188
00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:50.590
Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in the positive impact they may have in the

189
00:10:50.591 --> 00:10:51.424
world?

190
00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:52.343
<v 1>Yeah. And to be clear,</v>

191
00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:56.950
my communication wasn't suggest wasn't meant to minimize payments. Yeah.

192
00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.980
Or to denigrate it in any way. It was a,

193
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.580
an attempted communication that when I was surveying the world,

194
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.380
it was an algorithm of what could I individually yes.

195
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.980
Do. So there's,

196
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.780
there are things that exist that have a lot of potential that can be done.

197
00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.930
And then there's a,

198
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.610
a filtering of how many people are qualified to do this given thing. Yes.

199
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.770
And then there's a further characterization that could be done of, okay.

200
00:11:24.771 --> 00:11:29.490
Given the number of qualified people, will somebody be, uh,

201
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:33.330
a unique out performer of that group to make something truly impossible,

202
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.490
to be something done that otherwise couldn't get done? So there's,

203
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.720
there's a process of assessing where can you add unique value in the world?

204
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.640
<v 0>And some of that has to do with you're being very, uh,</v>

205
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:46.640
very formal and calculative here, but some of that is just like,

206
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:48.520
what do you sense?

207
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:53.000
Like part of that equation is how much passion you sense within yourself to be

208
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.040
able to drive that through mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; to discover the possibilities

209
00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:56.680
and make them.

210
00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.480
<v 1>Possible. That's right. And so we, we were, uh, a Braintree.</v>

211
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:04.120
I think we were the first company to integrate Coinbase into our, uh,

212
00:12:04.121 --> 00:12:08.920
I think we were the first payments company to formally incorporate, uh,

213
00:12:08.921 --> 00:12:10.200
crypto, if I'm not mistaken.

214
00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:12.080
<v 0>For people who are not familiar,</v>

215
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.910
coin base is a place where you can trade cryptocurrencies.

216
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:19.310
<v 1>Yeah. Which was one of the only places you could. So we were early, uh, in,</v>

217
00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:24.110
in doing that. And of course this was in the year 2013.

218
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:29.550
So an attorney to go in, in cryptocurrency land, I concur with the,

219
00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:35.060
the statements you made of the potential of

220
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.500
the principles, underlying cryptocurrencies,

221
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.740
and that many of the things that they're building in the name of money and

222
00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:45.693
of, and of,

223
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.260
of moving value is equally applicable to the brain

224
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:56.650
and equally applicable to how the brain interacts with the rest of the world and

225
00:12:56.651 --> 00:13:01.650
how we would imagine doing goal alignment with people. So it's,

226
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:05.290
to me, it's a continuous spectrum of possibility. And we're talk,

227
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.930
your question is isolated on the money.

228
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:11.250
And I think it just is basically a scaffolding layer for all society.

229
00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.290
So you don't see the.

230
00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:13.970
<v 0>This money as particularly the.</v>

231
00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.000
<v 1>I don't it's. I think we, we,</v>

232
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:21.640
at Colonel we will benefit greatly from the progress being made in

233
00:13:21.641 --> 00:13:24.520
cryptocurrency, because it will be a similar technology stack.

234
00:13:24.521 --> 00:13:27.200
We will want to use for many things we want to accomplish.

235
00:13:27.201 --> 00:13:31.680
And so I'm bullish on what's going on and, uh,

236
00:13:31.681 --> 00:13:33.600
think it could greatly enhance, uh,

237
00:13:33.601 --> 00:13:35.910
brain interfaces and the value of the brain interface ecosystem.

238
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.990
<v 0>I mean, is there something you could say about first of all,</v>

239
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:41.190
bully on cryptocurrency versus FIAP money?

240
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:45.470
So do you have a sense that in 21st century cryptocurrency will

241
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:50.990
be embraced by governments and change the, the,

242
00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.670
the face of governments, the structure of governments? It's.

243
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:55.940
<v 1>The, it's the same way? I think about</v>

244
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:02.390
my diet where previously it was conscious Brian

245
00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:09.040
looking at foods in certain biochemical states on I hungry, am I irritated?

246
00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.320
Am I depressed? And that I choose based upon those momentary windows.

247
00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.760
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; do I eat at night when I'm fatigued and I have low will

248
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.430
power, and I gonna pig out on something.

249
00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:23.190
And the current monetary system is based upon human conscious

250
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:26.950
decision making and politics and power and this whole mess of things.

251
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:31.870
And what I like about the building blocks of cryptocurrency is

252
00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:36.110
it's methodical, it's structured. It is, uh, accountable,

253
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:40.180
it's Trent as parent. And so it introduces this scaffolding,

254
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:41.140
which I think again,

255
00:14:41.141 --> 00:14:45.460
is the right starting point for how we think about building next

256
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:49.020
generation institutions for society.

257
00:14:49.021 --> 00:14:51.440
And that's why I think it's much broad than much broader than money.

258
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:56.160
<v 0>So I guess what you're saying is Bitcoin is the demotion of the conscious mind</v>

259
00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:01.210
as well. In the same way you were talking about diet is like,

260
00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:03.410
uh, giving less priority to the,

261
00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:08.770
the ups and downs of any one particular human mind in this case, your own and,

262
00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:11.680
uh, giving more power to the sort of data driven.

263
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.760
<v 1>Yes. Yeah. I, I think that is accurate.</v>

264
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.640
That cryptocurrency is

265
00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:25.880
a version of what I would call my autonomous self that I'm trying to build.

266
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:26.940
Yeah.

267
00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:31.670
It is an introduction of an autonomous system of value

268
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:36.910
exchange and Val and, and the process yeah.

269
00:15:36.911 --> 00:15:39.510
Of value creation in society. Yes. And so there similarities.

270
00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:44.070
<v 0>So I guess what you're saying is Bitcoin will somehow help me not out at night</v>

271
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:45.230
or the equivalent of.
