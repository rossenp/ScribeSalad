1
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.130
<v 0>Can you tell the story of the months that led up to</v>

2
00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:11.850
Barry's assassination? What did, what, what, what did you know,

3
00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:13.490
what did you sense? What.

4
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.130
<v 1>Did you think? Okay. When I got up prison, I hadn't been out long. I was, uh,</v>

5
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.890
watch eating breakfast and there was Ronald Reagan's face,

6
00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:22.010
right in the television.

7
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.240
We have absolute proof that the communist San Anisa government is in the

8
00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:30.520
cocaine run in business. And there was that fat lady,

9
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.280
the C 21, 26 on the runway with bail in.

10
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.960
And I thought, oh God, he had done it.

11
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.640
So I had heard that Barry Mudman working with him.

12
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.190
So it wasn't long working with, with the DEA, whoever he, that he,

13
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.190
he was no longer on our side, you know?

14
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.610
<v 0>So, uh,</v>

15
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.590
can you clarify how you got that from the Reagan making a statement about.

16
00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.310
<v 1>We've heard, okay. There was his plane, there was Barry's plane and okay.</v>

17
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.390
On the way north, we could stop in, in Nicaragua land,

18
00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:04.940
on the military base or on a,

19
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.380
a base that they used as crop dusters and all and refuel. Yeah.

20
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.700
And so that shortened, our trip would go further into the jungle and come up.

21
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.580
And that was what PLU Escabar and Ocho and them. And they had to,

22
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.620
they was associates with the, the people in, uh, Nicaragua.

23
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.420
<v 0>So Barry was, if that plane was there, that means Barry.</v>

24
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.490
He was feeding the da information.

25
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.250
<v 1>He was working with him at that time. But let me back up a little bit when,</v>

26
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.930
when I was flying and I told Barry, we would,

27
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.010
we would refuel and train airplane, the, the loads and police, where I had a,

28
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.090
a spot up there. And then that's when the,

29
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.890
they told me we can refuel and, and, uh, Nicaragua,

30
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.560
and then you fly all the way and Barry couldn't believe it. He says, all right,

31
00:01:49.561 --> 00:01:50.400
but I wanted to land.

32
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.840
I had a place in Louisiana for $10,000 that I could land unload.

33
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.240
And the sheriff and all of 'em was paid off. And, uh, he said, no, no, no,

34
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.040
I can't get caught in me in Arkansas. I said,

35
00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:06.350
what do you mean you can't get caught in me, Arkansas, you called anywhere.

36
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.150
He said, I can't if it going,

37
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.510
but it's gonna cost you $50,000 every time my wheels touch the ground.

38
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.220
<v 0>Why can you explain why he can't get fired?</v>

39
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.780
<v 1>He was, he was hooked up with the, with him the very top. And he even said,</v>

40
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.060
I'm gonna have dinner with the governor tonight.

41
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.490
<v 0>That's at that time mean a Mr. Bill Clinton, undoubtedly.</v>

42
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.930
<v 1>And it so like, did bill Clinton, did you give any money? And I said, no,</v>

43
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.330
I never be the man any money.

44
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.290
But it was like the money that I had that went to grand canyon islands.

45
00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:40.570
And I told my lawyer, I said, I never touched that money. He said,

46
00:02:40.571 --> 00:02:43.450
you don't have to fondle it to be guilty. So.

47
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.251
<v 0>So what I mean,</v>

48
00:02:45.251 --> 00:02:49.560
there's a lot of conspiracy see theories around the relationship between Paris

49
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.880
seal and the Clintons. Absolutely. What evidence do we have?

50
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.960
What, what would you say from your best understanding, um,

51
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.480
of what was the relationship between bill Clinton and Barry seal?

52
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.800
<v 1>Barry said, and he knew that he couldn't get caught in me in Arkansas.</v>

53
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.320
And when that movie was gonna come out, be called MENA, somebody stopped it.

54
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.480
I mean, they stopped it dead in the tracks for two or three years.

55
00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.840
And the producer even quit.

56
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.150
<v 0>He, you mean the American made with Tom cruise movie. It wasn't,</v>

57
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.790
it was gonna be.

58
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.070
<v 1>Called Meina it's the name?</v>

59
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.510
It was written and produced in Meina &lt;laugh&gt; and wait,

60
00:03:27.511 --> 00:03:29.710
waiting on Hillary to be elected. They,

61
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:33.230
they would not understand let that movie out underst and that movie was changed

62
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.330
drastically.

63
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.550
<v 0>But to push back on that, that doesn't mean there's truth there.</v>

64
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.900
That means they were worried about out the power of the conspiracy theory.

65
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.220
That's right. Which stuck &lt;laugh&gt; exactly means, but I don't know. I mean,

66
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.130
you know, some,

67
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.020
some conspiracy theories just because they're popular doesn't mean they're true

68
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.980
and ones that, uh, but it also doesn't mean they're not true.

69
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.020
And there's ones that are not very popular, could be true, but that one,

70
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.850
that one really stuck did do do. I mean, what's your sense?

71
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.610
<v 1>Well, I paid one and a half million dollars for Barry to land at MENA Arkansas.</v>

72
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.210
So I was pretty well assured that he couldn't get caught.

73
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.800
And I said, well, I can't get caught in Columbia.

74
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.440
We can't get caught in Nicarag. Well, I guess we got a license.

75
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.030
<v 0>So we went for it. Oh. So when you say I can't get caught, just to clarify,</v>

76
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.590
there's a, there's a sense where this is a safe place to land. Yes.

77
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.710
<v 1>Like completely.</v>

78
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.470
<v 0>Safe. So you don't think he was referring to some kind of, um, you know,</v>

79
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.270
like my grandfather who fought in a world war II would talk about

80
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.860
bullets. Can't hit him. So it's almost like no believing.

81
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.580
<v 1>He was taking that $50,000 and giving it to somebody, to somebody.</v>

82
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.740
And Barry was honest.

83
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.940
So he wasn't just taking it from me because he was making a million dollars and

84
00:04:50.941 --> 00:04:52.140
he didn't care for the 50,000.

85
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.140
<v 0>Oh man.</v>
