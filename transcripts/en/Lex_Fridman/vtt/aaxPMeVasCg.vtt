1
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.900
<v 0>Yeah, I would say just as a small aside,</v>

2
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.260
that's why reading as I'm almost done with, uh,

3
00:00:09.261 --> 00:00:12.860
the rise and fall of the third Reich. Oh yeah. Is, uh,

4
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.550
it's, uh, refreshes the resets,

5
00:00:16.551 --> 00:00:20.780
the palette of your understanding of what is good and evil in the world that I

6
00:00:20.781 --> 00:00:25.580
think is really useful now. Like, you know,

7
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.320
what helps me be really positive and almost naive on Twitter,

8
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.930
uh, and in the world is by just studying history and,

9
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.540
and, uh, comparing it to how amazing things are, uh, today.

10
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.050
But in that time, what

11
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.260
would you do?

12
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.790
What does the brave mind do and

13
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.260
not just, uh, acts of bravery,

14
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.350
but how do you be effective in that?

15
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.700
And that's something I often think about. It's sometimes easy to be an activist,

16
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.670
uh, in terms of just saying stuff it's hard to be effective at your

17
00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:14.120
activism. One of the big questions historians have, uh,

18
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.930
constantly is how did this happen? A to make sure it doesn't happen again,

19
00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:22.760
but this is Germany. This is not some kind of weirdo cult nation.

20
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.690
They're very advanced, very in Atlanta, poets and philosophers.

21
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.880
How did it get to that point that they're just shooting children and everyone's

22
00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:32.720
cheering for this,

23
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.580
and specifically on the anti-Semitism and the Holocaust [inaudible] and the

24
00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:40.100
cult of Hitler. And it was just this whole kind of thing.

25
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.950
The size is starting to drop, but there's two sides.

26
00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:46.970
I don't know if you want to separate them. One is the totalitarianism and the,

27
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.530
the entire, the entirety of the Nazi regime. And then there's the Holocaust,

28
00:01:51.531 --> 00:01:54.200
which is like, you know, going,

29
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.150
I would say like very specifically,

30
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.960
uh, as I think you're about to describe as like, you know,

31
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.660
targeting Jews very much.

32
00:02:05.661 --> 00:02:07.880
So I don't know if you see those as two separate things.

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.450
I think they're very interconnected, but I think if you look at it,

34
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.650
everyone thinks that they'd be the ones putting up Anne Frank.

35
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.240
But if you look at the numbers,

36
00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:21.170
they'd be the ones calling the Staci on her or whoever the people were at the

37
00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:23.690
time and not the Staci, obviously, uh,

38
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.690
and patting themselves on the back for it. So, sorry to pause on that.

39
00:02:26.691 --> 00:02:29.750
It's a really important thing. If you're listening to this,

40
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.610
that you were not, you were in Germany at the time,

41
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.660
you would have likely been willing to commit,

42
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.690
or at least keep a blind eye to the violence against Jews.

43
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.490
Like you have to really sit with that idea that you would have been

44
00:02:46.491 --> 00:02:50.150
somebody who, uh, just sees this and is not bothered by it.

45
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.220
And also very likely kind of understand this as a necessary

46
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.190
evil or even a necessary. Good. Yeah.

47
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.750
And I people think that they would be,

48
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:05.380
the abolitionists are marching on Selma the numbers. Don't add that,

49
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.150
add up to that at all. And I think the question will be like, what social I,

50
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.940
my friend was on Tinder, my friend, Matt. Who's a great dude.

51
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.470
And the question was, what's the most controversial opinion you have.

52
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.960
This is New York. And the girl wrote, I hate Trump.

53
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.990
And what people perceive themselves as being courageous in saying, and doing,

54
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.470
and what is the actual social costs of you saying,

55
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:31.810
or doing this are two very disconnected things.

56
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.850
And we're also trained by corporate media to have completely

57
00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:40.450
vapid, uninteresting, banal ideas.

58
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.960
And yet regardless cells as revolutionaries, you know,

59
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.370
there are people who still in New York will take pride because they have a gay

60
00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:52.480
friend. And it's like, first of all, who cares?

61
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.550
But second of all, you are not a hero and that person's not your prop,

62
00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.080
by the way. That's another big problem.
