00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.060
<v 0>What was your favorite feature of Python? Do you remember? Like what? Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.420
So it's so interesting to linger on like the, what,

3
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.900
what really makes you connect with a language?

4
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.500
I'm not sure it's obvious to introspect.

5
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.700
<v 1>That. No, it isn't. And I I've thought about that. It's just some length.</v>

6
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.050
I'm not, I, I think definitely the fact that I could read it later. Yeah.

7
00:00:26.051 --> 00:00:29.810
That I could use it productively without becoming an expert and like other

8
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.330
language I had to put more effort into. Right.

9
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.570
<v 0>That's like an empirical observation.</v>

10
00:00:33.571 --> 00:00:36.170
Like you're not analyzing any one aspect to language.

11
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.650
It just seems time after time, when you look back, it's somehow.

12
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.490
<v 1>Readable, it's somehow readable and then it, it was sort of, I could take, uh,</v>

13
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.400
executable English yeah. And translated to Python more easily.

14
00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:49.360
Like I didn't have to go. There was no translation layer, uh,

15
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.600
as an engineer or as a scientist, I could think about what I wanted to do.

16
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.960
And then the syntax wasn't that far behind it. Yeah. Right now there was some,

17
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.560
there have some theres, some warts there still, it wasn't perfect.

18
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.280
Like there's some areas where I'm like, ah,

19
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.200
it would be better if this were different. Or if this were different.

20
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.310
<v 2>Some of those things got added a language too.</v>

21
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.990
I was really grateful for some of the early pioneers in the Python ecosystem

22
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.750
back, cuz Python got written in 91 is when the first version came out,

23
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.550
but GTO was very open to users.

24
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.550
And one of the sets of users where people like Jim Hugin and,

25
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.550
and David Asher and Paul Deua and uh, Conrad Hinson,

26
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.340
these were people that were on the main and they were just asking for things

27
00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:29.340
like, Hey, we really should have complex numbers in this language. So let's,

28
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.100
you know, there's a J there's a one J right. And the fact they went,

29
00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:35.620
the engineering route of J is interesting. I,

30
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.340
I don't think that's entirely favoring engineers.

31
00:01:38.341 --> 00:01:42.660
I think it's because I is so often used as the index of a for loop &lt;laugh&gt; I

32
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:43.620
think that's actually why.

33
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.690
<v 0>Probably, right. I mean, there's, there's a.</v>

34
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.850
<v 1>Pragmatic aspect, but the fact that complex numbers were there.</v>

35
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.370
I love that the fact that I could write in the arrays constructs and that

36
00:01:51.371 --> 00:01:55.090
reduction was there very simple to write summations and, and,

37
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.650
and broadcasting was there. I could do addition of whole arrays. Um,

38
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.930
so that was cool. Those are some things I loved about it.
