00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.550
<v 0>What is deep work? Let's start with a big question.</v>

2
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:07.511
<v 1>So I mean, it,</v>

3
00:00:07.511 --> 00:00:12.270
it's my term for when you're focusing without distraction on a cognitively

4
00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:15.910
demanding task, which is something we've all done,

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.310
but we had never really given it a name necessarily that was separate from other

6
00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:24.500
type of work. And so I gave it a name and said,

7
00:00:24.501 --> 00:00:27.980
let's compare that to other types of efforts you might do while you're working

8
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.700
and see that the deep work efforts actually have a huge benefit that we might be

9
00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:33.534
underestimating.

10
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.580
<v 0>What does it mean to, to work deeply on something?</v>

11
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.620
<v 1>I, you know, I had been calling it hard focus in my writing, uh, before that.</v>

12
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.090
Well, so the context you had underst I was in the theory group in Cun at MIT.

13
00:00:46.091 --> 00:00:46.251
Right.

14
00:00:46.251 --> 00:00:50.050
So I was surrounded at the time when I was coming up with these ideas by these

15
00:00:50.051 --> 00:00:54.610
professional theoreticians. And that's like a murderer's row of thinkers there.

16
00:00:54.611 --> 00:00:57.930
Right. I mean, it's like touring award touring, award MacArthur, touring award.

17
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.570
I mean, you know, the crew, right? Theoretical computer science,

18
00:01:01.571 --> 00:01:05.720
theoretical computer science. Yeah. Yeah. So, so I'm in the theory group, right.

19
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.480
&lt;laugh&gt; doing theoretical computer science. Uh, and I publish a book. So,

20
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:13.440
you know, so I was in this Milu where I was being exposed to people, uh,

21
00:01:13.441 --> 00:01:16.600
where focus was their tier one skill. Like that's what you would talk about,

22
00:01:16.601 --> 00:01:20.720
right? Like how, how intensely I can focus. That was the, the key skill.

23
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.120
It was like your four 40 time or something if you were a, an athlete. Right.

24
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.910
<v 0>So, so this is something that people actually, the, uh, the,</v>

25
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.950
the theory folks start thinking about, oh yeah, really? Oh yeah.

26
00:01:30.951 --> 00:01:34.190
Like they're openly discussing, like, how do you focus? I mean, I.

27
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.710
<v 1>Don't know if they would, you know, quantify it, but,</v>

28
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.750
but focus was the tier one skill. So you,

29
00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:43.070
you would come in here would be a typical day. You'd come in. Uh,

30
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.260
and Eric domain would be sitting in front of a one whiteboard. Yeah. Right.

31
00:01:46.261 --> 00:01:49.100
With a whole group of visitors who had come to work with them.

32
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.580
And maybe that projected like a, a grid on there.

33
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.060
Cause they're working on some graph theory problem. You go to lunch,

34
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.300
you go to the gym, you come back, they're sitting there staring at the same,

35
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.900
same whiteboard, right? Like that's the tier one skill.

36
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.380
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; this is the difference between different disciplines. Like, I,</v>

37
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.010
I often feel for many reasons like a fraud,

38
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.290
but I definitely feel like a fraud when I hang out with like either

39
00:02:11.291 --> 00:02:13.730
mathematicians or physicists. It's like,

40
00:02:13.731 --> 00:02:18.650
it feels like they're doing the legit work because when you talk closer in

41
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.210
computer science, you get to programming or like machine learning, like the,

42
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.970
the, the experimental machine learning,

43
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.760
or like just the engineering version of it. It it's,

44
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.800
it feels like you're gone so far away from what's required to solve

45
00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:36.600
something fundamental about this universe.

46
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.960
It feels like you're just like cheating your way into like some kind of trick to

47
00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:44.040
figure out how to solve a problem in this one particular case. Yeah.

48
00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:48.750
That's how it feels like. And it's, I'd be interested to,

49
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.470
to hear where you think about that because, um,

50
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.230
programming doesn't always feel like you need to think

51
00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.560
deeply to work deeply, but.

52
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.520
<v 1>Sometimes it does. So it's a, it's a weird dance for sure. Code does. Right.</v>

53
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.240
I mean, especially if you're coming up with original algorithmic designs,

54
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.320
I think it's a great example of deep work. I mean, yeah. The, the,

55
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.760
the hardcore theoreticians, they, they push it to an extreme, I mean, I,

56
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.510
I think it's like knowing that athletic endeavor is good and then

57
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:22.110
hanging out with a Olympic athlete, like, oh,

58
00:03:22.111 --> 00:03:25.030
I see that's what it is right now for the grad students. Like me.

59
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:29.430
We're not anywhere near that level, but the faculty, the faculty in that group,

60
00:03:29.431 --> 00:03:32.550
these were the cognitive Olympic athletes.

61
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.510
But Cody and I think is a classic example of deep work because I got this

62
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:38.950
problem I wanna solve. I have a,

63
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.980
all of these tools and I have to combine them somehow creatively and on

64
00:03:43.981 --> 00:03:46.220
the fly. But, but so basically I had been exposed to that.

65
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.420
So I was used to this notion when I was in grad school and I was writing my

66
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:52.220
blog. I'd write about hard focus. You know, that was the term I used.

67
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.700
Then I published this book so good. They can't ignore you,

68
00:03:55.701 --> 00:03:57.820
which came out in 2012. So like right,

69
00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:02.770
as I began as a professor and that book had this notion of skill being

70
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:04.850
really important for career satisfaction, that, uh,

71
00:04:04.851 --> 00:04:06.170
it's not just following your passion.

72
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.930
You have to actually really get good at something.

73
00:04:08.931 --> 00:04:10.330
And then you use that skills as leverage.

74
00:04:10.331 --> 00:04:12.810
And there was this big follow up question to that book of, okay, well,

75
00:04:12.811 --> 00:04:14.570
how do I get really good at this? Yeah.

76
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.370
And then I look back to my grad school experience. I was like, huh,

77
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.280
there's this focus thing that we used to you.

78
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.480
I wonder how generally applicable that is into the knowledge sector. And so,

79
00:04:24.481 --> 00:04:27.040
as I started thinking about it, it became clear.

80
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:29.440
There's this interesting storyline that emerged that, okay.

81
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.160
Actually undistracted concentration is not just important for esoteric

82
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.800
theoreticians. It's important here.

83
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.720
And it's important here and it's important here. And that involved into the, uh,

84
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.150
the deep work hypothesis, which is across the whole knowledge work sector.

85
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.110
Focus is very important and we've accidentally created circumstances where we

86
00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:47.870
just don't do a lot of it.
