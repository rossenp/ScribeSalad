1
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.580
<v 0>And so we talked about patron. What about social networks? Well,</v>

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.710
they're inherently like search a global algorithm.

3
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.380
You're trying to find friends of friends.

4
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:13.650
You're doing the transitive closure of a graph induced by this friend of

5
00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:18.330
relation, but you should own your friend relation.

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.010
You should own your posts.

7
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.030
They shouldn't be owned by somebody else who can take them down or send to them.

8
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.320
And your friend relations,

9
00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:27.480
you should be able to find those friends on other networks.

10
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.430
And that's why I've tweeted about this. I haven't built it yet.

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
What if the browser could keep track of those for you?

12
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:37.710
What if the browser could maybe combine Facebook and Twitter and you could find

13
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:40.080
your friends on both and you could have a sort of that.

14
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.930
<v 1>The relationship is not owned by Facebook or Twitter. It's owned by, you know,</v>

15
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.500
the process.

16
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.030
<v 0>We'll have terms of use, and they'll say they own it,</v>

17
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.030
but if they zap you on one and you're still on the other,

18
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.170
your friends find you and the browser could observe a combined view.

19
00:00:54.171 --> 00:00:56.630
You could resurrect almost across network.

20
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.680
<v 1>Because it's something I want to maybe quickly ask you about on that front.</v>

21
00:01:00.681 --> 00:01:04.640
There's been, uh, quite a lot of, um, centralized.

22
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.630
We talked about wall street bets, and then, uh,

23
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.530
Robin hood has been centralized banning of different accounts

24
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.110
and removing like parlor, for example,

25
00:01:15.111 --> 00:01:19.160
from AWS and this kind of overreach of centralized control

26
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.850
is your hope that it's possible to like,

27
00:01:22.851 --> 00:01:24.500
what are your thoughts about that in general? Is it,

28
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.600
and then is it possible to create tools that give individual people the

29
00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:32.420
power to fight back against overreach.

30
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.020
<v 0>Control? So we're talking about oligarchy. I do think,</v>

31
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.630
and that if it controls a nation state, that's formidable,

32
00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:41.240
it's the tax and the police power, the military power.

33
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.180
It means that you may have the great firewall of China.

34
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.230
You may have people in China who are jailed because of their tweets, right?

35
00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:51.410
This is a serious threat. I can't minimize it or say that will win.

36
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.140
I don't know how it's going to go. But I do think,

37
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.350
like I said earlier about the cunning of reason, people find ways around things,

38
00:01:57.351 --> 00:01:59.060
the internet routes around censorship,

39
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.940
and this is not to endorse any particular bad faction.

40
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.690
One of the things that happens when you try to wave the free speech flag too

41
00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:06.350
much,

42
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.040
you say I'm not going to censor anything and you get colonized by terrible,

43
00:02:10.041 --> 00:02:13.130
terrible people. I guess I don't care if you call the Neo Nazi,

44
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.110
some of them could be doing illegal things, right?

45
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.620
And you don't want them calling us because it'll ruin your reputation and

46
00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:19.454
destroy your business.

47
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.900
So what you really want is that kind of user first subsidiarity that

48
00:02:23.901 --> 00:02:24.734
subjectivity.

49
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.780
I want my social networks to be composited in some multi social

50
00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:32.660
user interface where I don't lose track of people across networks.

51
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.840
And if they leave one or they get banned from one, I can find them on another.

52
00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:38.240
I can still sort of thread them together. Yeah, that's brilliant.

53
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.950
And this didn't happen because browsers got captured by the central powers.

54
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.210
Why did they get captured?

55
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.420
Mostly because of search and search is a central algorithm. So, you know,

56
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.000
Larry Page said this too many years ago, he said with search,

57
00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:53.600
you're giving up a little privacy by handing a query over to us and then we'll

58
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.350
air correct. It. Alan Eustace used to be at Google and Google executive.

59
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.280
He said, Oh yeah, we used to laugh. They'd be doing typos.

60
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:03.070
And they'd be typing the wrong word. We're like no dummy type that query.

61
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:06.370
And it's like, okay, Google might want to dial back that ego a little bit.

62
00:03:06.371 --> 00:03:07.210
But yes,

63
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:10.300
you do see all the queries and you can improve them and you can find the best

64
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:13.900
results. And that was Google's forte. When we did the Firefox deal in 2004,

65
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:17.410
Google was really good. And over time, you know, SEO,

66
00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:21.010
which is an adversarial game. Yeah. And Google itself,

67
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.760
buying all these companies and crowding its own results page with its own tied

68
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:27.580
in yet stuff that needs to slippers.

69
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.880
<v 2>That happens when you, when, uh,</v>

70
00:03:29.881 --> 00:03:33.600
when you have control over these kinds of really important mechanisms. Yeah.

71
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.080
<v 0>Anomaly capitalism or cartel, you get this with the Robin hoods and the,</v>

72
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.280
the hedge funds you get, uh, sort of the money interest takeover,

73
00:03:41.281 --> 00:03:43.830
and kind of abuse their power and wear out their welcome. So what,

74
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:44.850
how do you get around that?

75
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.260
You have to have either new land to go to which, you know,

76
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.380
some people's ancestors, not mine did to found the country, um, um,

77
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.370
mostly Irish, German. Um, you, you have a new virtual space. People go to,

78
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.190
and that requires, you know, an ISP to,

79
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.070
or colo center or Amazon to host you.

80
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.150
It requires domain name registrar who will not strike you.

81
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.480
And so you want parlor was taken down. You know,

82
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.590
I thought that was egregious parlor. I was not well designed. And I,

83
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.920
I tried it out cause I tried all these things. Um, but I didn't use it.

84
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.790
And I also felt they were being unfairly scored for not moderating because you

85
00:04:23.791 --> 00:04:27.300
can find tweets to this day that are horrendous and threatened also with the

86
00:04:27.301 --> 00:04:29.730
violence, whereas Twitter, why isn't Twitter being taken down,

87
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.990
but someone's very selective.

88
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.560
It was the insiders who have the power are going to take out the new lever.

89
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.140
And it looked bad, sort of like the,

90
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.280
the hedge funds sorting GameStop looked bad. You know,

91
00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:44.670
you're seeing a piece in time magazine this week. That's like basically saying,

92
00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:47.490
yeah, we interfere with the election, but it was great. Aren't we good?

93
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.020
I don't know if you've seen this piece yet.

94
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.730
If you tried to say that as a Trump supporter in, in November,

95
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.010
after the election, you get banned from Twitter.

96
00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.350
But now time in its Twitter account is saying, you know, we saved the day. We,

97
00:05:00.351 --> 00:05:03.570
we it's AFL CIO and big business.

98
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.400
The better business Bureau got together,

99
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.200
kept Trump from the spreading of fake news. So the country's kind of broken.

100
00:05:10.201 --> 00:05:13.110
I don't know how to fix that. The oligarchs have run wild in my opinion.

101
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.950
And big tech is in the anti-trust doc. What's going to happen.

102
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.090
I don't think they get out.

103
00:05:18.091 --> 00:05:21.120
I think some of the DOJ and certainly the state cases,

104
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.060
because there's a separate cases are not going to go away just because somebody

105
00:05:24.061 --> 00:05:25.230
got elected differently.

106
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.040
And these are career prosecutors and they have a strong case. Um,

107
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.850
and Google smart and Microsoft almost got split up, right? Uh,

108
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.090
the judge Thomas Penfield, Jackson, he overreached,

109
00:05:36.091 --> 00:05:38.730
he didn't hold a hearing about the remedy. He just said,

110
00:05:38.731 --> 00:05:42.300
I'm going to break you up. And Microsoft appealed on the higher level.

111
00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.630
Courts said, go back and figure this out. You're not breaking them up.

112
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.780
You didn't even hold a hearing. And when they got back, Microsoft said,

113
00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:49.830
let's settle. Let's settle.

114
00:05:49.831 --> 00:05:53.790
We want to get broken up because Jackson was going to make the ops code,

115
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.590
the operating system company and the app's co office w you know, word Excel.

116
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.220
And, uh, that would have been a huge blow to Microsoft. So.

117
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:02.980
<v 1>But ultimately, I don't know.</v>

118
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.870
I don't know if you're optimistic or cynical about the possibility of breaking

119
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.340
up big tech. And to me, uh,

120
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.120
I'm optimistic that tools like brave.

121
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.360
I love the idea of owning your friendships like as users,

122
00:06:16.361 --> 00:06:20.260
more and more owning the stuff is the only real way. Unfortunately,

123
00:06:20.261 --> 00:06:23.590
it's like the wall street bet suburb is the only real way to fight the

124
00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:24.430
centralized power.

125
00:06:24.431 --> 00:06:26.770
You can't break them up with the regulation is very difficult.

126
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.270
<v 0>For the law. You know,</v>

127
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.750
Netscape was long dead or acquired by AOL and effectively dead.

128
00:06:31.751 --> 00:06:35.200
It was only Muslim that returned Firefox to the market. Uh,

129
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.860
by the time that the USB Microsoft case was finally settled in,

130
00:06:38.861 --> 00:06:41.740
the penalties were put in place. And, uh,

131
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.350
and yet antitrust has a role to play.

132
00:06:44.351 --> 00:06:47.530
Those penalties caused Microsoft to kind of turn away from the web.

133
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.230
They did windows Vista and they thought the web's too painful.

134
00:06:50.231 --> 00:06:51.910
We got punished in court and we got,

135
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.340
we had to standardize things with those icky standards, people.

136
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.540
So they ran back to proprietary lock-in and windows Vista flopped. It was late,

137
00:06:58.541 --> 00:07:02.860
it was bloated Longhorn river. Now what Google is most going to save it?

138
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.750
Google is smart enough. They won't get split up.

139
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.050
They'll split something out to get off the hook. I think.
