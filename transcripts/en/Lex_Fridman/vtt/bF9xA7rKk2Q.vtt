1
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.823
<v 0>You, um,</v>

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.520
you've also mentioned to me offline that you're really excited about all the

3
00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:12.200
different wearables and all the different ways we can collect information about

4
00:00:12.201 --> 00:00:15.260
our bodies about, uh, well,

5
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.280
the whole thing is it w what's most exciting to you in terms of collecting the,

6
00:00:19.281 --> 00:00:23.850
the, the biological, uh, data, uh,

7
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:24.830
about a human being?

8
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.810
<v 1>Well, so I'm a biologist. I find animals and humans as machines.</v>

9
00:00:29.811 --> 00:00:31.550
Very interesting. Um,

10
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.060
it's one of the reasons I didn't become an engineer or a surgeon.

11
00:00:35.061 --> 00:00:39.050
I wanted to understand how we actually built. And, uh,

12
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.180
so I think a lot about machines merging with humans and

13
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.200
the first of that other bio wearables. And so I talked a lot about this.

14
00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:50.000
I wrote about it, um, in lifespan,

15
00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:54.980
the book and pictured a future where you would be monitored constantly so

16
00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:58.130
that you wouldn't suddenly have a heart attack, you'd know that was coming,

17
00:00:58.131 --> 00:01:02.030
or you, you wouldn't go to the doctor and they don't know if it's an,

18
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.070
you need an antibiotic or not. Um, long-term how old are you,

19
00:01:07.071 --> 00:01:09.440
how to fix things? What should you eat? What should you take?

20
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.670
What your doctor do? These devices I predicted would be smarter,

21
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.090
better educated than your, than your physician and would augment them.

22
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.150
And then there'd be a human that would just tick off to see if that it's

23
00:01:20.151 --> 00:01:22.190
correct. And they approve. Um,

24
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.110
I also was predicting in the book that we would have video conferences with

25
00:01:27.111 --> 00:01:30.800
our doctors, and that medicines would be delivered initially by courier,

26
00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:33.470
but eventually by drones and get it to you sometimes in an emergency.

27
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.630
And that we could even have pills that were, were synthesized or delivered, um,

28
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.430
in your kitchen and combined.

29
00:01:40.431 --> 00:01:44.900
Certainly what's amazing about that is that what are we now,

30
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.660
two years since the book came out even less,

31
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.610
and that future is basically here already. COVID 19 accelerated,

32
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.660
accelerated that incredibly. So where we're at now in society is if you,

33
00:01:56.661 --> 00:01:59.870
if you want to pay for it, you can have a blood test that will detect cancer 10,

34
00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:04.730
20 years earlier than it would before it forms a tumor. You can of course,

35
00:02:04.731 --> 00:02:08.090
do your genome very cheaply for less than a hundred dollars. Now, um,

36
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.920
there are bio wearables already. I wear this bring from aura, um,

37
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.750
that I have number of years of data.

38
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.140
I've been doing blood tests for the last 12 years with a company called inside

39
00:02:18.141 --> 00:02:22.100
tracker, which I consult for. And so I have all of that data as well.

40
00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:26.390
And there's 34 different parameters on my testosterone, my blood glucose,

41
00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:30.590
my inflammation, and I use all that data to, of course,

42
00:02:30.591 --> 00:02:32.600
I wear a watch that that measures things as well.

43
00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:36.830
I use that data to keep my body in optimal shape.

44
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.010
So I'm now 51. And according to those parameters,

45
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.940
I'm at least as good as someone in their early forties. And I,

46
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.080
if I really work at it,

47
00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:49.880
I can get my biochemistry down to early to mid thirties. Um,

48
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.210
though I liked it. You know, now ate a little dessert once in a while.

49
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.040
So that's the future we're in right now. Anyone can do what I just said,

50
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.210
but the very near future, just in the next few years,

51
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.010
or you can be wearing wearables. So I'm currently wearing a little,

52
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.170
what's called a bio sticker. Uh, this one, um, I just put on last night,

53
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.390
uh, it's about an inch long, a few millimeters.

54
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.170
<v 0>We were just listening. It's a San David's chest. It was just a,</v>

55
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.690
how does it attach it? Just kind of, it sticks on.

56
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.320
<v 1>Yeah. So on one side you have an on button that you press the lights come on,</v>

57
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.310
flashes four times. It's good to go immediately syncs to your phone.

58
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.530
And this one, uh, the it's called a buyer button and last name. And there's a,

59
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.120
there's another one that I have that I haven't tried yet.

60
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.370
That does EKG on your heart. Um,

61
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.460
this is mainly for doctors to monitor patients that go home after a heart attack

62
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:46.180
or surgery, but that's medical grade, FDA approved device.

63
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.460
So there will be a day. In fact,

64
00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:53.320
it's already here that doctors are using these to get patients to go home and

65
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:56.590
save a week in hospital, $2,000,

66
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.360
at least for each patient,

67
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.960
that's massive safe savings for the hospital.

68
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.400
But ultimately what I'm excited about is a future that isn't that far off where

69
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.670
everybody certainly in developed countries,

70
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:11.860
eventually these will cost a few cents and rechargeable.

71
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.880
The only cost will be the software subscription that can be monitored

72
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:16.714
constantly.

73
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.620
And to give an idea what this is measuring me at a thousand times a second is,

74
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.030
uh, my vibrations as I speak my orientation,

75
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.230
it can tell already has told me this morning, how I slept, where I slept,

76
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.150
what side I slept on. Uh, we've got sneezing, coughing,

77
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.590
body temperature, heart rate,

78
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.970
hot of other parameters of the heart that would indicate heart health.

79
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.610
These, these data are being used to now to,

80
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.800
to predict sickness.

81
00:04:47.801 --> 00:04:51.520
So eventually we'll have just in the next year or so,

82
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.880
the ability to predict whether something or diagnose whether something is

83
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:59.650
pneumonia or just a rhinovirus that can be traded or

84
00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:04.270
not, right. This is really going to not just revolutionize medicine,

85
00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:07.330
but I think extend lives dramatically. Cause if I have,

86
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.300
if I'm going to have a heart attack next week and that's possible,

87
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.050
this device should know that and I'll be in hospital before I even have it.

88
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.170
<v 0>Maybe you can talk a little bit about inside tracker.</v>

89
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.120
Cause I saw that there's some really cool things in there, like it actually. So,

90
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.250
um, maybe you can talk about, I guess,

91
00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:27.820
that you're collecting blood to give it the data. So,

92
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.440
and it has like basic recommendations on how to improve your life. So it's not,

93
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.940
we're not just talking about diseases, right? Like anticipating, uh,

94
00:05:35.941 --> 00:05:37.000
having a particular disease,

95
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:40.270
but it's almost like guiding your trajectory to life. How to,

96
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.590
whether it's extend your life or just live a more fulfilling,

97
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.710
like improve the quality of life. I suppose this is the right way to say it.

98
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.180
What, how does inside track of work? Uh, what the heck is it?

99
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.100
Cause I thought there was also pretty cool. Yeah. What is it?

100
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.320
I guess it's something other people can use. You.

101
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.490
<v 1>Can definitely use it. Uh, you can sign up at.</v>

102
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.370
<v 0>It's consumer particular company and consumer facing.</v>

103
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.920
<v 1>Company. It is. Yeah. Uh,</v>

104
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.510
and I also want to democratize the ability to, to just take a mouth swab.

105
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.970
Eventually we don't need to have a blood test necessarily,

106
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.800
but for now it's a blood test and,

107
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.780
and you'd go to a lab Corp request in the U S um, it's also available overseas.

108
00:06:17.781 --> 00:06:22.280
You can upload your own data for a minimal cost and get the algorithms,

109
00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:27.170
the AI in the background to take that data plot where you

110
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:28.940
are against others in your age group,

111
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.260
as in terms of health and longevity at bio age, they call it inner edge,

112
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.580
but also it provides recommendations. And this isn't just a bunch of BS.

113
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:39.620
It sounds like it might be to say,

114
00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:41.810
I'll go eat this or go to that restaurant in order that,

115
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.070
but it's actually based on they basic this company has entered

116
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.593
hundreds.

117
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.650
Now it would be thousands of scientific papers into their database and hundreds

118
00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:53.210
of thousands of human data points.

119
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.100
And they have tens of thousands of individuals that have been tracked over time

120
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.940
and anonymously. That data is used to say what works and what doesn't,

121
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.970
if you eat that, what works if you take that supplement, what works?

122
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.830
And I was in a coauthor on a paper that showed that the recommendations for food

123
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.320
and supplements, um,

124
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.800
was better than the leading drug for type two diabetes.

125
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:21.410
<v 0>That's so cool. The idea that you can connect, like skipping the human,</v>

126
00:07:21.411 --> 00:07:24.890
having to do this work, you can connect the scientific papers,

127
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.660
almost like meta analysis of the science connected to the individual data.

128
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.240
And then based on that sort of connect your data to whatever the proper

129
00:07:35.241 --> 00:07:36.260
group is within the,

130
00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:39.940
whatever the scientific paper is to make the suggestion of how,

131
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:44.480
how I called that work, applies to your life.

132
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.200
And then that ultimately maps to like a recommendation of what you should do

133
00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:49.034
with your life.

134
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:54.170
Like it all like this giant system that ultimately recommends you should drink

135
00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:55.520
more coffee or less.

136
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.840
<v 1>Right. And we'll have the genome in there as well. You can upload that here. Uh,</v>

137
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:03.770
and so these programs will know us way better than we do. And,

138
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:05.180
and our doctors as well,

139
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.180
the idea of going to a doctor once a year for an annual annual checkup and

140
00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:11.540
having, you know, males get a finger up their button, uh, you know,

141
00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:12.830
you cough that,

142
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.960
that to me is a joke that's medieval medicine and that's very soon going to be

143
00:08:17.961 --> 00:08:18.794
seen as medieval.

144
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.910
<v 0>Yeah. It's um, to me, as a computer science person,</v>

145
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.550
it's always upsetting to go to the doctor and just look at him and like,

146
00:08:28.551 --> 00:08:32.930
realize, you know, nothing about me. Like you, you you're, you're,

147
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.050
you're making your like opinions based on like,

148
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:41.120
it is very valuable years of intuition building about basic

149
00:08:41.121 --> 00:08:44.960
symptoms, but you're just like, it is medieval. They're very good at it.

150
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.943
In fact,

151
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.960
doctors in medieval times are probably good at working with very little,

152
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.400
but the thing is I would rather prefer for a doctor

153
00:08:56.401 --> 00:08:57.960
that doesn't really know what they're doing,

154
00:08:57.961 --> 00:08:59.910
but has a huge amount of data to work with.

155
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.170
<v 1>Well, you're right. And many of my good friends are doctors. I work at Harvard.</v>

156
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.170
Um, so I'm not against the profession at all,

157
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.590
but I think that they need just as much help as anyone else does.

158
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.950
We wouldn't drive a car without a dashboard. We wouldn't think of it.

159
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.630
So why would doctors do the same.
