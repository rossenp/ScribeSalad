1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.070
<v 0>Through American cosmic. And in general,</v>

2
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:07.530
you've attracted with much of the UFO community.

3
00:00:07.531 --> 00:00:12.390
You mentioned you follow just by the ways that you will

4
00:00:12.391 --> 00:00:14.700
follow adjusts or is it you follow adjusts,

5
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.290
you follow first of all, what is the you follow adjust?

6
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.700
And second of all, um, what have you learned about this, uh,

7
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.870
community of euphology lists or also as you refer to them as, uh,

8
00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:32.460
the invisibles or the members of the invisible college,

9
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.150
or just in general, people who study your photos from the different,

10
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.300
all the different kinds of groups of study? UFO's sure.

11
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.060
<v 1>Generally what I found is that they are, okay.</v>

12
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.300
So people who are interested in your photos from like being a kid, you know,

13
00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:50.240
and seeing some cool movie like star Wars or something,

14
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.890
and then they become interested in,

15
00:00:51.891 --> 00:00:56.450
then they study it as best they can UFO's or UAPs.

16
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.340
They're generally an honest group of people who are using their

17
00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:04.940
tools. And there are generally two types of them. Um,

18
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.250
there are those who believe in the nuts and bolts,

19
00:01:07.251 --> 00:01:11.690
like the physical craft and they believe in that these are things from other

20
00:01:11.691 --> 00:01:16.670
planets. Okay. So that's like the T H hypothesis, uh, you know,

21
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.490
um, I'm sorry. E T hypothesis ETH is what we call it. Yeah. Sorry about that.

22
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.270
<v 0>So this is like, there's an actual spaceship, like a physical,</v>

23
00:01:26.271 --> 00:01:30.620
like something akin, but much more advanced than the rockets we use now.

24
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.230
And there's some kind of,

25
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.320
not necessarily biological,

26
00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:39.650
but something like biological organisms that travel on these.

27
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.140
<v 1>So this would be like what to the stars Academy is trying to decipher,</v>

28
00:01:45.141 --> 00:01:47.270
like how, you know, how do they do it? You know,

29
00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:51.020
maybe we could use that technology, the propulsion and things like that.

30
00:01:51.021 --> 00:01:54.410
They look at the rocket technology. Okay. So there are those,

31
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.100
and then there are people who believe that it's more consciousness based. Okay.

32
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.690
So these are your two types of, um, you follow just who are known.

33
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.730
And these are people who we know about.

34
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.660
Then I found that there are people who are quote unquote,

35
00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:13.370
I call them the invisibles because jock valet in the, in the seventies,

36
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.510
he, and, um, I think actually, Alan, Hynek his colleague quoted,

37
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.550
this is a Francis bacon thing. By the way,

38
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.380
it goes back to the early modern time period when scientists could be killed for

39
00:02:24.381 --> 00:02:28.670
basically trying to go outside where the church or the government

40
00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:33.440
institution determined was dogma. And so they had to be really careful.

41
00:02:33.441 --> 00:02:35.660
So they call, he called it the invisible college.

42
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.700
So Hynek took that term and return, re-used it? Or what do you call it?

43
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:41.803
Repurposed it.

44
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.340
So he repurposed it so that they were still talking to each other though.

45
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.910
So what I found to be the case was that there was a group of people who were

46
00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:53.840
scientists, but were not on the internet, you know,

47
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.730
10 people today and students of mine in particular and my own kids.

48
00:02:58.731 --> 00:02:59.470
Actually,

49
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.980
they think that you only exist if you're on the internet or something really

50
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:05.920
exists if it's on the internet and that's of course untrue.

51
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.520
And so what I found was that there are most people who are the most powerful

52
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:12.940
people of our society and are doing things are not on the internet.

53
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.650
You're not going to find a trace of them.

54
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.970
So a lot of these people are what I call invisibles.

55
00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:21.970
People who are studying, at least their work is invisible.

56
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.410
You might find them on the internet,

57
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:25.660
but you're going to find that they're part of the bowling league or something

58
00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:26.201
like that. Right.

59
00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:31.150
You will not find that they are actually engaged in research about this

60
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:31.990
topic. Okay.

61
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.500
And so I called them the invisibles because I was surprised to find them.

62
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.680
And I thought, well, this is no longer the invisible college,

63
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.020
because these people are not even talking to each other.

64
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.340
And that's why I reference this movie fight, clip in it.

65
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:48.970
You have an invisible. Okay. And his name is Tyler Durden.

66
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.980
And he's incredible. He does incredible things. Um,

67
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.490
he's like a person who should not exist. Right.

68
00:03:57.491 --> 00:04:00.160
Because he does so many things that are amazing.

69
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.240
And so I find a person like that and I call, and he's a real person. Um,

70
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.830
he's partially on the internet,

71
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:10.120
but nothing that he does around that topic of UFO's is on the internet.

72
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.920
So I decided to call him Tyler, D T after Tyler Durden. And so these people, I,

73
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.570
um, I've turned the UFO fight club because they work together,

74
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.930
but they don't know. In fact, his boss doesn't know what he does.

75
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.050
They don't talk to each other because you know, the first rule of fight club.

76
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.420
<v 0>Same as the second. Yeah.</v>

77
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.300
<v 1>Exactly. Yeah, no, you don't do it.</v>

78
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.840
<v 0>Why do you have a sense that, um, there's such a,</v>

79
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.350
um, I don't want to say fear, but a principle of staying out of the limelight.

80
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.320
<v 1>I think there's something real. And I think that the use of it could be, um,</v>

81
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.850
dangerous for people.

82
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.790
<v 0>Oh, sorry. You mean like something real, like there's actual techno I don't,</v>

83
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.730
what's the right terminology to hear to you alien technology

84
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.390
ideas about technology that are being explored

85
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.860
that are dangerous of made public. That may be become dangerous public.

86
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.310
<v 1>I wouldn't cut. You don't have to call it alien alien technology.</v>

87
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.920
You can call it ideas about alien technology,

88
00:05:13.921 --> 00:05:16.980
because I don't know if it's actual alien technology or not.

89
00:05:16.981 --> 00:05:20.370
I honestly don't know, but I do know for a fact,

90
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.750
because it's a historical fact that Jack Parsons and, um,

91
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.760
Constantine Schakowsky,

92
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.990
who's Russian believed in these things and believe that they were downloading

93
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.170
this information, whether or not they were, I don't, I mean,

94
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.300
they definitely created the rocket technologies.

95
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.040
That's true how they did and whether their process was

96
00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:44.670
exactly what they said it was. I don't know. So this is the same thing today.

97
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.050
So we've got some powerful technologies going on here and you know,

98
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.740
of course we have a military and we have a military for a reason. Every,

99
00:05:52.741 --> 00:05:55.950
almost every government he needs, the military has one. Um,

100
00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.920
and so they're going to, um,

101
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.330
keep these the way they should be kept in my interpretation. I mean,

102
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:05.630
think about it. Everybody accepts the fact that we have a military,

103
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.800
almost everybody does.

104
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.580
Why are they so upset then that the military keeps secrets?

105
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:12.250
<v 0>Yeah, well, that's,</v>

106
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.500
that's the nature of things we can get into that whole thing. I, I, uh, I,

107
00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:20.710
I tend to, I've spoken with the CTO of Lockheed Martin on this.

108
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:26.050
Um, I've obviously read and think about war a lot.

109
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.440
It's such a difficult question because the space,

110
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.570
this particular space of technology,

111
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.130
there's a gray area that I think is evolving over time.

112
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.620
I think nuclear weapons change the game in terms of what should,

113
00:06:41.621 --> 00:06:42.700
and shouldn't be secret.

114
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.440
I think there's already technology that will enable us to destroy each other.

115
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.910
And so there's some sense in which some technology should be made public.

116
00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:56.680
This is the same discussion of, um, you know, uh, between companies,

117
00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:01.060
which part of your technology should you make public through?

118
00:07:01.061 --> 00:07:04.030
Like for example, academic publications and all that kind of stuff.

119
00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.480
I call the Google search engine works page rank algorithm,

120
00:07:07.481 --> 00:07:09.790
or how the different deep learning,

121
00:07:09.791 --> 00:07:14.560
like those pretty vibrant machine learning research communities within Google,

122
00:07:14.561 --> 00:07:17.920
Facebook and so on. And they release a lot of different ideas.

123
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.570
It's an interesting question.

124
00:07:19.571 --> 00:07:23.260
Like how dangerous is it to release some of the ideas?

125
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:26.680
I think it's a gray area that's constantly changing.

126
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.440
I do also think it's super interesting.

127
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.760
I wonder if you could elaborate on a little bit that there's this

128
00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.610
gray area between what's actually real in terms of

129
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.480
alien technology and the belief of it

130
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:49.300
when held in the minds of really brilliant people that they ultimately may

131
00:07:49.301 --> 00:07:54.250
produce the same kind of result in terms of being able to create

132
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:58.090
new technologies that are human usable,

133
00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:02.890
like is there, um,

134
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.420
in your mind,

135
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:09.430
they're one in the same as like believing in alien craft

136
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.930
and, uh, actually being in possession of an alien craft.

137
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.970
<v 1>I don't think they're the same. No belief is powerful. Okay. Um,</v>

138
00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:24.550
in new age communities, you know, people think thoughts are things okay.

139
00:08:24.551 --> 00:08:25.750
That's been said, you know,

140
00:08:25.751 --> 00:08:27.970
thoughts are things you can make them happen kind of thing.

141
00:08:27.971 --> 00:08:28.840
Believe in them enough.

142
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:33.940
It is true that if I believe I can run a

143
00:08:33.941 --> 00:08:37.600
five 40 mile, I'll do it. Okay. And I probably will do it.

144
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.140
And I've done it before. Actually I'm much younger, but I did it.

145
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:47.140
So, but my coach is the one that instilled that belief in me. Right. And so,

146
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.730
but can I run like one minute mile? No. Okay.

147
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.760
So I guess, does that answer your question? Like there's only,

148
00:08:54.761 --> 00:08:58.110
so belief goes in generating reality.

149
00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:02.720
<v 0>Well, yeah. I mean, I guess that's what, uh, just having listened to Jack valet,</v>

150
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:06.980
it seemed like reality is not,

151
00:09:06.981 --> 00:09:11.840
was not as important for the scientific exploration of the concept of alien

152
00:09:11.841 --> 00:09:12.674
technology.

153
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.710
<v 1>I could be wrong, but this is what I think shocks getting at.</v>

154
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.910
There were other ways to access places in reality,

155
00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:25.220
other than what we consider to be physical. Right. That's this consciousness.

156
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.560
Okay. So in, like I said,

157
00:09:27.561 --> 00:09:31.070
so religious studies is among other things. It's just,

158
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.860
it's looking at visionary experiences. All right.

159
00:09:33.861 --> 00:09:37.730
So people do have visionary experiences. They did without drugs, you know,

160
00:09:37.731 --> 00:09:40.070
they did with drugs, they do with drugs.

161
00:09:40.071 --> 00:09:42.710
They do many have them without drugs today.

162
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.760
And oftentimes those visionary experiences, um,

163
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:51.440
correspond to each other now, how do we, how do we make sense of that? So,

164
00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:55.940
you know, do these places actually exist in a sense, I think they do.

165
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.190
And so I think that, you know,

166
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:02.720
like let's take that very famous case of a Virgin Mary operation in Fatima,

167
00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.860
where I think there was like a lot of people, thousands and thousands, if not,

168
00:10:06.861 --> 00:10:10.100
like, I think 50,000 or something like that, a lot of people, uh,

169
00:10:10.101 --> 00:10:14.900
gathered to see what's now called the miracle of

170
00:10:14.901 --> 00:10:17.570
Fatima, which was the spinning of the sun will,

171
00:10:17.571 --> 00:10:22.160
a lot of people saw different things, but they all saw some kind of thing.

172
00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:27.290
Okay. So they all saw different things, but it was, uh, something happened.

173
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:31.970
Okay. So I guess the question is, um,

174
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:37.010
what are these places where we access non

175
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.670
what I'd call like non-physical realities. Okay.

176
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.130
Where we actually do get information. We did get, like,

177
00:10:43.131 --> 00:10:46.490
who could say that Jack Parsons didn't get information from doing these rituals

178
00:10:46.491 --> 00:10:49.160
and accessing these. We have to say that he actually did,

179
00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.540
because we see the results of physical results, the same thing with Tyler.

180
00:10:53.541 --> 00:10:58.430
And that's why I put Tyler in this camp with this tradition with

181
00:10:58.431 --> 00:11:03.200
Jack persons. I say that Tyler is, is getting these,

182
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:07.340
what he calls downloads. And you can see the results of them physically.

183
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:10.820
He sells them on the NASDAQ. He makes millions of dollars from them. He,

184
00:11:10.821 --> 00:11:13.850
they help people. I've seen people who they've helped.
