00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.580
<v 0>Is there something you can say about fundamental principles of judo?</v>

2
00:00:07.581 --> 00:00:11.060
Is there overall that time? Not 20,

3
00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:15.950
over 20 years that you've been doing judo. Uh, it's not approaching 30 isn't.

4
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.910
<v 1>Yeah. It's yeah. Getting it's going to get in there.</v>

5
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.100
There were a couple of years away. Let's get in there.

6
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.010
<v 0>Um, is there some like principles that have emerged, like you said,</v>

7
00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:31.070
you had to have your center of gravity below theirs.

8
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.400
Is there other kind of both on the gripping side,

9
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.390
the footwork side leverage and anything you can speak to?

10
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.110
<v 1>There's some that have withstood like time,</v>

11
00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:47.060
like you have to be able to get below their center of gravity because you

12
00:00:47.061 --> 00:00:50.960
have to be able to rotate them around their center of gravity.

13
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.670
And then the other one is that was always a principle when I was growing up and

14
00:00:55.671 --> 00:00:59.780
I didn't change until later on in my career was you have to be able to pull,

15
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.230
you need to be able to pull, to get them off balance.

16
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.580
But when you think about that statement as a whole, it ended with,

17
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.080
they have to be off balance. I don't need the pull to get you off balance.

18
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.920
I just need you off balance. And when you think about it, that way,

19
00:01:15.921 --> 00:01:20.840
it allows you to open up the doors to what do I need to do to get you off

20
00:01:20.841 --> 00:01:24.440
balance? I could push, pull. I could flinch. I could fake.

21
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.300
And you could put yourself in your own off-balance state, right?

22
00:01:29.301 --> 00:01:33.620
When you think about people who wrestle, right? If I fake shooed,

23
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.130
it causes you to over lean forward, which means you're off balance.

24
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.770
There's no pole, there's no push. There's no nothing.

25
00:01:39.771 --> 00:01:43.940
I just get a reaction that leaves the opportunity and the door open for an

26
00:01:43.941 --> 00:01:44.774
attack.

27
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.490
<v 0>And that off-balance could be very.</v>

28
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.200
<v 1>Subtle. It could be very subtle.</v>

29
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.880
And the better you get in the more skilled you get, the less subtle it is.

30
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.060
<v 0>So we should also mention that there is something called forward throws where</v>

31
00:01:59.061 --> 00:02:02.690
you throw the person, you know,

32
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.210
they they're gonna fly facing forward.

33
00:02:05.211 --> 00:02:10.190
They're gonna fly forward and then backward throw they're going to fly back.

34
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.220
Yep.

35
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.440
<v 1>And then there's lateral, you know, they actually go sideways over it,</v>

36
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.380
like a Cartwheel almost.

37
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.140
<v 0>Okay. So the forward throws,</v>

38
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.290
there is the one we've been talking about was just saying, again,

39
00:02:21.291 --> 00:02:22.610
there's a bunch of different variants,

40
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.250
[inaudible] this drop and they're standing versions of them. And that all,

41
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.500
I don't know if there's a way to summarize it,

42
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.650
but that's like as clean as a,

43
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.580
getting your center of gravity under theirs as it gets.

44
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.790
And then the rest is just gripping variations. Yep.

45
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.560
I guess it's all gripping variations on all of these threads, but, um, and then,

46
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.220
uh, there is, uh, in terms of forward throws,

47
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.910
there's the other big one in competition is each

48
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.910
Yamada, which is, I dunno, we can try to explain that,

49
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.970
but it, uh, ends up being where one you're standing on,

50
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:07.090
just one of your feet and the other one is up in the air.

51
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.330
And I don't know if you'll put in that same category, her, I go,

52
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:15.280
she like those kinds of throws where you're kind of a little bit single

53
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:17.080
footed. And then, so there's.

54
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.970
<v 1>Two footed techniques and then there's single.</v>

55
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.850
<v 0>Foot. Yeah. Oh, Goshi where it's like,</v>

56
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.980
you're doing a mix between Uchi Mata and the Sandaga. Yep.

57
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.000
It's a hug.

58
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.890
You hug a person and then you turn your hips around such that you're now

59
00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:34.600
hugging, facing the same direction.

60
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.670
<v 1>I'm still forward. Throw theirs,</v>

61
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.130
regardless of the name of the throw or the gripping variation that

62
00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:42.964
you're using.

63
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.740
The whole principle is how do I get this person to do a forward roll in midair

64
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.210
and land on their back?

65
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.860
The more of a forward roll I can get the bigger, the score.

66
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.030
If I get like a quarter of a turn where like you land on your side and you don't

67
00:03:58.031 --> 00:04:00.670
go over your back to half score. Yeah.

68
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.930
But they all require me to get you to do that forward. Rolling back.

69
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.150
<v 0>Sure. So just, if we think of one person,</v>

70
00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:11.800
if they do this nice leap forward and they do a roll and their back

71
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:14.980
nicely rolls over the ground, you try and do the exact same thing.

72
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.450
Would you connect to them before?

73
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.470
<v 1>And if it's nice and it's smooth, it's probably not a full score.</v>

74
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:24.190
It needs to have like somewhat of a violent impact.

75
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.060
Right. So if you think of a drop, say Nagi, if I,

76
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.500
if I'm moving too slow and you still roll over your shoulders and there's no

77
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:36.580
direct impact, it's only a half score. Right. They want the force.

78
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.460
<v 0>The force, the violence. Yeah. Good. Okay. Uh, so then, uh,</v>

79
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.470
in terms of, uh, backward throws the traditional ones,

80
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.150
there's stuff where you trip them from outside their

81
00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:54.160
body, like a Soto gari,

82
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.290
it's a trip where you hook your leg onto their leg and it tripped them.

83
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.140
But to your hook, it goes outside of their legs.

84
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.700
And then there's the trips from inside their body. There's a,

85
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.350
one foot is called guardian and the others, OCI gari doesn't matter.

86
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.300
The most important thing is outside and inside. Uh,

87
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.470
and then there's like,

88
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.170
I don't even know how you throw them sideways except foot sweeps.

89
00:05:20.171 --> 00:05:25.030
And then there's the foot sweeps where you can sweep one of their legs from out

90
00:05:25.031 --> 00:05:26.980
of them or both of their legs at the same time.

91
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.410
And like we were talking about this kind of is when timed perfectly,

92
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.570
it's, it's effortless for everybody involved. And, uh, the ending,

93
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.630
like you said, is big dramatic and violent. Yeah.

94
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.570
Is there other kind of, oh yeah, there's a sacrifice techniques. Yep. Um,

95
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.340
there's a bunch of them and that ultimately the variations have to do with, uh,

96
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.203
gripping,

97
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.130
but you're basically you the attack or fall onto your back sticking

98
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.350
legs somewhere on, onto their body,

99
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.280
which is like this fall Chrome over which day fly and do that same kind of role.

100
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.730
Yeah.

101
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.970
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

102
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.500
You basically sacrifice your back to the mat in order to throw them into that

103
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:13.130
circular pattern. So they hit their back. Sometimes we use a foot,

104
00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:13.964
sometimes we don't.

105
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.190
<v 0>And so we should probably say,</v>

106
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.350
it's okay for you to go onto your back as long as you're clearly

107
00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:23.930
demonstrating control over the other person's body.

108
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.921
<v 1>Correct.</v>

109
00:06:24.921 --> 00:06:29.630
You can't go to your back in the same direction that you opponent is

110
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:32.210
trying to put you to your back. Right.

111
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.040
You have to go the other way or you have to initiate you going to your own

112
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:37.874
back.

113
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.870
<v 0>All right. Uh, like clearly, and then, um,</v>

114
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.000
and then there's all the counters,

115
00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:48.830
which almost kind of have a whole group of their own, even though they have,

116
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.440
uh, echoes of the same types of techniques.

117
00:06:51.441 --> 00:06:53.330
It seems like they're their own whole thing.

118
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.070
<v 1>Yeah. But they follow the same principles. It's just most counters.</v>

119
00:06:58.071 --> 00:07:01.730
Like if you want it to counter energy Mata, for example,

120
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.200
your trying to throw me in a summer salt over my right shoulder,

121
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.300
therefore I would counter you by throwing you over your left shoulder.

122
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.860
It goes in the opposite shoulder direction, but in the same somersault.

123
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.910
<v 0>The idea, and there used to be, I already forget at this point,</v>

124
00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:20.661
forget the years,

125
00:07:20.661 --> 00:07:25.250
but it might be 20 before the 2012 Olympics or they banned, uh,

126
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.540
you used to be allowed to grab legs in the same way you do in wrestling.

127
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.160
So you have basically all the techniques you would have in wrestling, um,

128
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.950
available to you if you'd like. Yeah. Uh,

129
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.520
it's just that some of the techniques in wrestling are not that effective for

130
00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:42.890
getting your opponent, your, to their back. Yep.

131
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.340
Wrestlers want to take the other person down in any way possible and then have

132
00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:49.130
control. Judo wants to take you down. And like we said,

133
00:07:49.131 --> 00:07:51.890
in a big fashion where your back slams on the ground. Yeah.

134
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.120
<v 1>It has to be to the back.</v>

135
00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:56.900
A lot of wrestling takedowns happen because they get behind them. Yeah.

136
00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:59.540
And then they, they parterre out. Yeah.

137
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:04.700
<v 0>So, uh, but the judo banned all touching of the legs,</v>

138
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:07.190
which is very dramatic change at the sport.

139
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.170
<v 1>But on the 2012 after.</v>

140
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.243
<v 0>It was after.</v>

141
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.470
<v 1>In 2012, so 2008,</v>

142
00:08:12.471 --> 00:08:16.850
I fought the games and everything was free in 2012.

143
00:08:16.851 --> 00:08:21.740
We could only touch the legs as a defensive action or

144
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.200
in response to an attack.

145
00:08:24.201 --> 00:08:27.650
So I could try to throw you with a normal throw.

146
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.380
And then when you try to counter, I could grab you like.

147
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:32.360
<v 0>Right. So th there.</v>

148
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.000
<v 1>Uh, had to be a secondary technique and didn't it.</v>

149
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:38.960
<v 0>Didn't they disqualify on a first offense.</v>

150
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.720
<v 1>That's first offense was a direct disqualification,</v>

151
00:08:41.721 --> 00:08:46.490
which happened at the 2012 games to the 57 Brazilian who

152
00:08:46.491 --> 00:08:49.970
won in 16. Yeah. She was dqued and I think the quarters,

153
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:55.410
and it was like, I wouldn't say it was blatant as much as,

154
00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:59.460
I don't think the act changed the outcome of the match. Had they not.

155
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.220
<v 0>Disqualified? Sure. That's not that dramatic. And by the way,</v>

156
00:09:02.221 --> 00:09:06.630
you say 57 that refers to weight divisions in that in kilograms

157
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.760
and kilograms is the measure of weight that the rest of the world uses does not.

158
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:17.490
Um, so, and there's a, we should say the divisions for, for guys.

159
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.450
Um, I dunno what the 70, I don't know, the lower level.

160
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.540
<v 1>60, 66,</v>

161
00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.980
73 and 81 9000 and heavyweight, which has no ceiling.

162
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:34.500
<v 0>No ceiling. Yeah. It is important distinction.</v>

163
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.140
Um, so,

164
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:41.520
and you competed most of your career at 81 kilograms. All of it.

165
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.200
All you never did.

166
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:44.880
<v 1>Never did 73.</v>

167
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.580
<v 0>But you had to cut big for 81 anyway, especially.</v>

168
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.110
<v 1>Towards the end of my career. Yeah.</v>

169
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.360
<v 0>Okay. Uh.</v>

170
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.030
<v 1>I overly grew into the division. What's.</v>

171
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.780
<v 0>Uh, I'm trying to remember, is that about 180 pounds.</v>

172
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.090
<v 1>178.6, I think.</v>

173
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.720
<v 0>And you have to weigh in with the.</v>

174
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.360
<v 1>The geek. No, nothing.</v>

175
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.690
You're not allowed to wear anything except for your underwear way is.

176
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.180
<v 0>Sorry. Confused and digest. So that's right. That's right. That's right.</v>

177
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:13.830
That's which is very nice. Um, okay. So we,

178
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.590
would you say we covered most of the throws or no.

179
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.430
So there's the forward and the backward,

180
00:10:20.431 --> 00:10:24.150
there's a sacrifice throws in the counters. Yep. And the,

181
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.650
and then there's the light grabs.

182
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:29.250
And it was just say for the leg grabs that were effective, it's like, um,

183
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.960
the big pickups where you just kind of pick them up and try to figure out once

184
00:10:33.961 --> 00:10:36.450
they're in there, what the heck to do with their body to get them.

185
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.270
<v 1>To the ground. You just kind of figure it out as you go. I.</v>

186
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:42.360
<v 0>Think the really nice one that was, to me,</v>

187
00:10:42.361 --> 00:10:46.830
heartbreaking as a fantasy go is, I guess what's called a Fireman's carry,

188
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:51.300
which is, um, you know, it does lead to judo,

189
00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:52.920
like beautiful throws.

190
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:57.630
And the fact that that was gone as is that one I missed a little bit,

191
00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.430
but then a bunch of people, I guess,

192
00:10:59.431 --> 00:11:02.370
came up with the variance where you don't need to grab the leg.

193
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:07.530
<v 1>Uh, it's definitely not as effective as being able to grab it,</v>

194
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.970
but I'm also on the side of the fence, having competed in all three,

195
00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.740
it was definitely better for the sport to remove it as a whole.

196
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.490
<v 0>It's probably good to cover sort of the whole spectrum of rules of,</v>

197
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:24.180
of judo is a there's groundwork. So there's a,

198
00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:27.170
you do all this stuff on the feet where you're trying to murder each other with

199
00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:31.500
the giant throw, but then, you know, if the throat doesn't succeed,

200
00:11:31.501 --> 00:11:34.470
you go to the ground and you stay in the ground for some amount of time,

201
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.100
like short amount of time, you have to move quickly, you have to be attacking.

202
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:43.290
And, uh, w w two of the ways you can win is similar to people who do jiu-jitsu,

203
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:47.970
as you can submit them, uh, chokes on breaks, all that kind of stuff,

204
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.970
no foot locks. And, uh,

205
00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:56.050
and you can also pin yep. It was just get around their legs. And this is very,

206
00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:01.240
no, this is not like wrestling. You have to actually get around their legs and,

207
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.450
uh, pin them in what ingest is called side control,

208
00:12:04.451 --> 00:12:07.870
Mount all kinds of ways that doesn't involve their likes. Yeah.

209
00:12:07.871 --> 00:12:09.970
And then you pin them for like, whatever, 20 seconds.

210
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:11.770
<v 1>It's 25 seconds, 20 seconds.</v>

211
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:16.480
Now I think the distinction is their back has to be facing the mat.

212
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:20.980
You have to be past their legs and your chest has to be on the same plane as

213
00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:24.280
theirs. Yeah. So it doesn't have to necessarily be on top,

214
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.080
but it has to be on the same plane.

215
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:27.010
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

216
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:31.630
And all of this is I think different sports have different versions of this,

217
00:12:31.631 --> 00:12:35.770
but it's like an approximation of what dominance looks like. Yeah.

218
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.700
So Penn and wrestling is dominating your opponent.

219
00:12:39.701 --> 00:12:41.470
Presumably if you were in a street fight,

220
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:44.320
that position allows you to then do a lot of damage.

221
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:48.070
Obviously submissions is dominance because you're breaking their arm or choking

222
00:12:48.071 --> 00:12:52.480
them to a, uh, unconscious. And then obviously the throw,

223
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.540
which is not often talked about, but like,

224
00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:58.300
if you talk about a street fight situation,

225
00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:03.190
a throw is like the best way to murder somebody like

226
00:13:03.191 --> 00:13:07.570
this could end anyone's life. Yes. It's terrifying actually. So, okay.

227
00:13:07.571 --> 00:13:09.610
So these are elements of dominance.

228
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.450
So going back to set of principles,

229
00:13:13.451 --> 00:13:17.260
you were mentioning getting your center of mass under there's,

230
00:13:17.261 --> 00:13:21.970
which I think applies for type of, um, like the forward say nugget throws.

231
00:13:21.971 --> 00:13:26.410
Is there, is there other stuff, um, also you mentioned off balance.

232
00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.633
<v 1>There's the,</v>

233
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:32.590
off-balance one where you can either pull to get an off balance or you can give

234
00:13:32.591 --> 00:13:36.280
way to the force, which can also lead to an off-balance.

235
00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.930
Um, you can amplify somebody force to,

236
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:44.470
so for example, if you push me,

237
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:49.480
you expect a certain reaction that you're ready for,

238
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.840
but if you push me and I pull you now,

239
00:13:52.841 --> 00:13:55.120
you didn't expect that much force coming out of you,

240
00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:56.500
therefore you're off balance.

241
00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:02.770
<v 0>The thing that's distinctly recognizable about judo is like when done</v>

242
00:14:02.771 --> 00:14:06.520
at the highest level, like it's,

243
00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:11.170
it seems effortless when the big throw happens. Yeah. Like that's just,

244
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.900
it doesn't, there is no other sport, like it in the,

245
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.890
in the combat sports where it's like, when the timing is right,

246
00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:22.030
everything's just this perfect. I think you, you get that in my ma and, um,

247
00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:26.320
boxing sometimes when this is a knockout. Yeah. Perfect strike.

248
00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:30.760
Just like where they, but it's not just like a hard hit it's like,

249
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:34.600
it's almost like the, with Conor McGregor and Aldo, for example,

250
00:14:34.601 --> 00:14:36.370
when you just catch him just rush. Right.

251
00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.700
<v 1>And that he didn't look like he hit him that hard, but he hit him just right.</v>

252
00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:44.290
<v 0>Yeah. And like, you get to see this all the time in Judah is as fascinating.</v>
