00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.780
<v 0>In terms of non-story books.</v>

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.620
The book that probably had the most impact on me,

3
00:00:08.621 --> 00:00:13.380
which is also a historical non-fiction is I am

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.820
obsessed with Antarctic exploration and it all began

5
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.260
with a book called Shackleton's incredible journey,

6
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.370
which is the collection of diaries of everybody who was on

7
00:00:27.371 --> 00:00:29.770
Shackleton's journey. For those who don't know, um,

8
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.770
Shackleton was the last Explorer of the heroic

9
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.490
age of Antarctic exploration. He led a ship called the endurance,

10
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.530
which froze in the ice, um, off the coast of,

11
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.600
of Antarctica in 1914.

12
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.600
And they didn't have radios over the last exploration,

13
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.560
a last one without the age of radio.

14
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.720
And he happens to freeze in the ice and then the ship collapses

15
00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.800
after a year frozen in the ice.

16
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.150
And this man leads his entire crew from that ship

17
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.790
onto the ice with a team of dogs survives out on the ice for another year,

18
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.750
with three little lifeboats and is able to get all of his men,

19
00:01:15.751 --> 00:01:18.270
every single one of them alive to an island,

20
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.830
hundreds of miles away called elephant island. And when they got there,

21
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.900
he had to leave everybody behind except for six people and him

22
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.460
and,

23
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.700
and two other guys I'm forgetting their names navigated by the stars,

24
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.780
800 miles through the Drake passage with seas of hundreds of feet

25
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.620
to prince. I think it's called prince George's island mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

26
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.980
And then when they got to prince George's,

27
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.850
they landed on the wrong side and they had to hike from one side

28
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.250
to the other to go and meet the whalers.

29
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.450
And every single one of those things was supposed to be impossible.

30
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.410
Nobody was ever, nobody was ever supposed to hike that island.

31
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.290
It wasn't done again until like the 1980s with professional equipment.

32
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.570
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; he did it after two years of starvation,

33
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.760
nobody was ever supposed to make it from elephant island to

34
00:02:09.761 --> 00:02:10.460
prince George,

35
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.920
the guy they had to hold him steady his legs so that he could chart the stars.

36
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.200
And if they missed this island, they're into open sea, they're dead.

37
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.080
And then before that, how do you survive for a year on the ice? Yeah, on seals.

38
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.173
And before that,

39
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.990
he kept his crew from depression frozen one year in the ice.

40
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.310
It's in just an amazing story.

41
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.390
And it made me obsessed with Antarctic exploration.

42
00:02:35.391 --> 00:02:38.870
So I've read like 15 books on what the hell is it about the human spirit that

43
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.670
it's AMA that's that's the thing about Antarctica is it brings it out of you.

44
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.590
You, so for example, I read another one recently called MOS's will Douglas Mo.

45
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.860
And he was an Australian. He was on the one of the first shackled or frost,

46
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.900
Robert Frost expeditions. He leads an expedition down to the south, him and, uh,

47
00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.400
a partner they're leading, uh, explorations 1908, something like that. Yes.

48
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:04.080
They're going around Antarctica, um, with dog teams.

49
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.000
And one of the,

50
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.160
what happens is they keep going over these snow bridges where there's a crevice,

51
00:03:10.161 --> 00:03:13.280
but it's covered in snow mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. And so the, one of the,

52
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.393
the lead driver,

53
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.150
the dogs go over and they plummet and that's sled takes with it.

54
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.830
So the guy survives, but that sled takes all their food.

55
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.070
Half the dogs, their stove, the,

56
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.950
the camping tent, the tent, specifically designed for the snow,

57
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.430
everything mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and they're hundreds of miles away from base

58
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:36.543
camp.

59
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.700
He and this guy have to make it back there in time before the ship comes

60
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.340
to come get them on an agreed upon date. And he makes it,

61
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.620
but the guy he was with, he dies and it's a crazy story. They, they have,

62
00:03:49.621 --> 00:03:51.140
first of all, they have to eat the dogs. The,

63
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.140
a really creepy part of Antarctic exploration is everyone ends up eating dogs at

64
00:03:55.141 --> 00:03:58.340
different points. Yeah. Um, and part of the theory,

65
00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.530
which is so crazy crazy is that the guy he was with was dying because

66
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.930
they were eating dog liver and dog. Liver has a lot of vitamin E,

67
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.130
which if you eat too much of it can give you like a poisoning. And so,

68
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.910
uh, MOS,

69
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.290
by trying to help his friend was giving him more liver of all the things that

70
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:21.200
kills you. I know his dog liver. And so his friend ends up dying,

71
00:04:21.201 --> 00:04:24.800
have a horrific heart attack. All of that, Mosin crawls back.

72
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.920
Hundreds of miles away makes it back to base camp hours after the ship

73
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.480
leaves. And two guys, or a couple guys stayed behind for him.

74
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.680
And he basically has to recuperate for like six months before he can even walk

75
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:41.070
again. But it's like you were saying about the human spirit.

76
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.310
It's like Antarctica brings that out of people or son,

77
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.470
the guy who made it to the south pole, Robert son, oh my God.

78
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.510
Like this guy trained his whole life in the ice from Norway

79
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.750
to make it to the south pole. And he beat Robert Frost, the,

80
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.820
the British guy with all this money and all the, these, I,

81
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:02.700
I could go on this forever.
