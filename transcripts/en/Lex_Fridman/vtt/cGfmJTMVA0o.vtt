1
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.320
<v 0>I do wonder if it's possible to at scale,</v>

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.280
encourage each other to approach like social media and communication with fellow

3
00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:12.600
humans in that way. I don't know. How do.

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.840
<v 1>You think that would be done, I guess, like to improve the,</v>

5
00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:17.400
improve the quality of discourse maybe like, or even like you said,

6
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:19.400
the empathy or the, the decency of discourse.

7
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.350
<v 0>I think people should be, you know, uh, I have,</v>

8
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.710
I encouraged to do that.

9
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.830
I think most of what's we see happening on Twitter and Facebook

10
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.350
and so on has to do with very small, but very powerful,

11
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.070
uh, implementation details. It, it goes down to like,

12
00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:42.950
what is the source of the dopamine rush, the like button, uh,

13
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.860
the sharing mechanisms, just even small tweaks in those can fix a lot.

14
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.420
Really. I, I believe so. So like a lot,

15
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.740
a lot of the stuff we see now is the result of just initial implementations of

16
00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:57.020
these systems that we didn't anticipate.

17
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.140
So the modernization comes from engagement and

18
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.290
the, the tools we have as clear clicking, like and sharing,

19
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.850
it was not always obvious. It was not obvious from the beginning.

20
00:01:09.851 --> 00:01:14.210
It wasn't obvious while Twitter and Facebook grew that there's a big dopamine

21
00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:17.530
rush from getting more followers and likes and shares.

22
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.010
So we've gotten addicted to this feeling like how many people are commenting,

23
00:01:21.011 --> 00:01:24.290
how many people are saying like, uh, a clicking like and so on.

24
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.080
So that's that dope immune, right?

25
00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:30.720
So we want to say the thing that'll get the most likes on like

26
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.080
UN mass in society.

27
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.800
And then the other thing that was expected is the controversial,

28
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.920
the divisive will get the most likes. So we,

29
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.080
it had to do with the initial mechanisms of likes and shares resulting in an

30
00:01:44.081 --> 00:01:47.950
outcome that was UN predicted, which is huge amounts of division,

31
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.110
irrespective of like any,

32
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.190
the basics of human connection that we've actually all come to understand the

33
00:01:56.191 --> 00:01:59.790
society is valuable at the individual level, like we're saying,

34
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.870
but on mass, what results is like,

35
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.020
you throw all that out and it's all just divisive at scale,

36
00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.780
uh, discourse. Uh,

37
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.740
I think it could be fixed by incentivizing personal growth,

38
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.900
like incentivizing you to challenge yourself,

39
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.300
to grow as individual and most importantly,

40
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.580
to be happy at the end of the day. So, uh,

41
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.290
feed like incentivize you feeling good

42
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.450
as in, in a way that's long lasting long term.

43
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.530
I think what makes people actually feel good is being kind to others long

44
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.010
term in the short term, what feels good is getting a lot of likes.

45
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.800
And I think those are just different incentive that if implemented

46
00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:51.440
correctly, you could just build social networks that would do much better.

47
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.000
So do.

48
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.640
<v 1>You think it comes from a structural perspective, I guess, at what point does,</v>

49
00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:57.240
you mentioned like, uh, you mentioned free will and also you mentioned, uh,

50
00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.920
you know, feeling good, like, and again, working hard, you know, you,

51
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.160
I know that you have the, uh, like, I guess the, was it a race or, um.

52
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.040
<v 0>No it's oh, the, the, the Goggins thing. Yeah. Uh,</v>

53
00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:11.600
it's four by 44 by four by 48 challenge where you are on four miles,

54
00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:14.800
every four hours for two days. That's awesome. Yeah, it's the,

55
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.480
it's a bunch of it's it's, uh, the, the,

56
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.430
the challenge of it IST and just the running, the running is very tough,

57
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.630
but it's mostly the sleep deprivation. Right.

58
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.630
Cause you're just training every four hours, but.

59
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.150
<v 1>It's a struggle. Right. And that's a struggle, but the struggle gives meaning.</v>

60
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.310
And ultimately, I guess, so how can we, because you mentioned, like you said,

61
00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:35.470
adjusting things on like a, uh, I guess like a programming level, almost, uh,

62
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.350
based programming level so that the interface is different for the user. Yeah.

63
00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:42.500
But at what point is, as the user have a responsibility to, you know, as a,

64
00:03:42.501 --> 00:03:47.420
as a man or a woman or a person to just behave more decently, how can we,

65
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.260
I guess, utilize, what can we do? It seems like, you know,

66
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.460
we're like our society is so grossly missing,

67
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:54.900
like a Martin Luther king right now,

68
00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:58.540
like the great inspiring characters throughout American history throughout world

69
00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:01.130
history. Where are the great leaders? I.

70
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.530
<v 0>So Le leadership is part of it, but I, you know,</v>

71
00:04:03.531 --> 00:04:06.730
that's definitely where are the great leaders is a very good question. That's,

72
00:04:06.731 --> 00:04:09.370
that's more of a question of our political systems,

73
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.490
why they're not pushing forward the great leaders, but there's also just the,

74
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.730
okay. There, there's, uh, some just basic engineering,

75
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.360
which is when you and I, I, when you,

76
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.400
Ryan and I are in a room alone and we're talking,

77
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.560
even if we're strangers, the incentives are for us to get along.

78
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.840
Like just when we're together in person, that's what I'm saying.

79
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.120
I'm not even saying some kind of, but when you, but when you remove that,

80
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.200
when we remove that, the, the, the implementation of, of the,

81
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.070
of social networks as they stand right now in the digital space,

82
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.390
have very different set of incentives. It's more fun to destroy others,

83
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.030
to be to others. And that, and it becomes this loop,

84
00:04:54.031 --> 00:04:56.190
endless loop, uh, like you were saying,

85
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.270
that's ultimately destructive and not productive.

86
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.460
And I think it has to do with just the into or faces of,

87
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.260
uh, making it feel good, to be nice to others.

88
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.140
Cuz currently it doesn't feel nearly as good to,

89
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.580
to be nice to others on the internet. And it,

90
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.740
it doesn't feel nearly as bad as it doesn't real life to be to others on

91
00:05:19.741 --> 00:05:22.410
the internet. So the incentives are just raw. I,

92
00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.570
I think there is a technology solution to this,

93
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.450
or at least a solution to improve this, uh, this communication mechanism.
