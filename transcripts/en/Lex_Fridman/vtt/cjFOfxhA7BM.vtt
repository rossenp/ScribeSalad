00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.920
<v 0>So I mentioned to you offline that I'm finishing up on the</v>

2
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.350
rise and fall of the third Reich.

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.450
I'm not sure if you have anything in your exploration, interesting to say,

4
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.700
but the use of religion by dictators or the lack of the use of

5
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:24.060
religion by dictators, whether we're talking about Stalin,

6
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.890
which is mostly secular, I apologize if I'm historically incorrect on this,

7
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:32.370
but I believe it's a secular and Hitler.

8
00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:37.170
I think there is some controversy about how much

9
00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:41.130
religion played a role in his own personal life and in general,

10
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.900
in terms of influencing the,

11
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.000
using it to manipulate the public. Uh,

12
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:53.670
but definitely the church played a role. Um,

13
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.650
do you have a sense of the use of religion by governments to control the

14
00:00:58.651 --> 00:01:01.740
populations by dictators for example,

15
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.930
or is that outside of your little explorations as

16
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:08.190
a religious scholar?

17
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.350
<v 1>It's not outside of my framework. Absolutely not. Um,</v>

18
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.770
I think that it's done routinely, um,

19
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.070
propaganda is done routinely, um,

20
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.960
especially there's nothing more powerful than religion to get people to

21
00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:26.270
act. I think, um,

22
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.930
I have my mother's Jewish and my father is, was Roman Catholic.

23
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.790
Okay. From Irish extraction. And so both, um,

24
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.330
members, both,

25
00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:44.300
both great grandparents came here under duress because they were being,

26
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.880
um, what would you call it? Uh,

27
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.230
there was an active genocide on both sides being den by other cultures. Okay.

28
00:01:51.231 --> 00:01:55.700
So on the one hand, obviously we know about the Holocaust. Okay. So they came,

29
00:01:55.701 --> 00:01:59.870
the great grandparents came here to avoid that and they made it, um,

30
00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:04.190
on the other hand, uh, there was an English, um,

31
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.990
genocide. We just have to say it of the Irish. Um, it was called a famine,

32
00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:13.340
but it wasn't one, a, it was a staged thing. And so, um,

33
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.110
millions of Irish left Ireland on coffin ships is what they called them

34
00:02:18.111 --> 00:02:21.740
because they usually wouldn't get here. Why happened to get here? Okay.

35
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.880
So those that's the context that I'm coming from. So in each case,

36
00:02:25.881 --> 00:02:30.470
for one thing, Irish weren't considered, you know, uh, there was,

37
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.220
uh, Catholics weren't considered, they were considered to be terrible.

38
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.630
And there was a lot of anti-Catholic rhetoric here in the United States, uh,

39
00:02:38.631 --> 00:02:40.820
which is kind of strange because one of the, in fact,

40
00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:45.380
the most wealthy colonial family were the carols in Maryland and they were

41
00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:48.410
Catholic. So when you look at the United States,

42
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.470
our history and you see the separation of church and state,

43
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.560
do you want to know where that came from? That came from those guys.

44
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.300
They convinced George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.

45
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.830
I mean, they couldn't vote yet. They had the, they had,

46
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.470
they have their names on the constitution.

47
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.210
Is that not a strange contradiction? So here, here,

48
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:13.030
you can see how propaganda works.

49
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.710
There was anti-Catholic propaganda, there was anti-Jewish propaganda.

50
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.990
Um, and all of, and a lot of it was that, you know, these people weren't human,

51
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.640
they weren't human beings. Um,

52
00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:29.410
another thing I'd like to say is that when the Irish did come here,

53
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.000
um, they were indentured a lot of times, indentured servants, um, but that's,

54
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.110
uh, that's terminology then debt. What does an indenture surface.

55
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.280
<v 0>Slave pretty much. So in that sense,</v>

56
00:03:44.281 --> 00:03:47.970
religion can be used, uh, derogatorily,

57
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.590
derogatorily as a useful grouping mechanism of saying, this is the other.

58
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.840
<v 1>And you know, it's powerful too, because behind it is a force of, um, you know,</v>

59
00:03:57.841 --> 00:04:02.760
what people contend to be sacred, a sacred force, right? So, you know,

60
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.630
it's up to God to, you know, decide who's, you know,

61
00:04:06.631 --> 00:04:10.770
so you have to go along with what God says, of course. Well, that's basically,

62
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.590
um, that's not the contact event. You know, the contact event is,

63
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:19.380
is usually some type of very specific legitimate event

64
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.000
that a person has with something that is non-human or considered divine.

65
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.470
Um, but when, when religions become,

66
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.820
um, narrativized, I would call it by a different institutions.

67
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.340
That's when you're in danger of getting propaganda.
