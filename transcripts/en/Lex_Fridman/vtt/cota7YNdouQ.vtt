00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.510
<v 0>Speaking of sort of challenges and hard things.</v>

2
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.030
Is there a possible world where sitting in a room with Mark

3
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.750
Zuckerberg with a $1 billion deal, you turn it down.

4
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.910
Yeah, of course. What does that world look like? Why would you turn it down?

5
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.910
Why did you take it? What was the calculation that you were make.

6
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.060
<v 1>Uh, that centers, the world of counterfactuals and not really knowing,</v>

7
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.820
and if only we could run that experiment. Well, the.

8
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.460
<v 0>Universe exists. It's just running in parallel to our own. Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.060
<v 1>It's so fascinating. Right. Um, I mean, we're talking a lot about money,</v>

10
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.060
but the real question was, um,

11
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.030
I'm not sure you'll believe me when I say this,

12
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.710
but could we strap our little company onto the side of a rocket ship

13
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.990
and like get out to a lot of people really, really quickly with the support,

14
00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.790
with the, the talent of a place like Facebook. I mean,

15
00:01:00.791 --> 00:01:03.550
people often ask me what I would do differently, um,

16
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.020
at Instagram today and at say, well,

17
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.220
I'd probably hire more carefully cuz we showed up just like before I knew it,

18
00:01:09.221 --> 00:01:13.180
we had like a hundred people on the team and 200 then 300,

19
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.940
I don't know where all these people were coming from.

20
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.820
I never had to recruit them. I never had to screen them.

21
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:19.860
They were just like internal transfers. Right.

22
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.820
<v 0>Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so it's like relying on the Facebook hiring machine,</v>

23
00:01:22.821 --> 00:01:27.530
which is quite sort of a, I mean it's an elaborate machine. It's, it's.

24
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.130
<v 1>Great. By the way, they have really talented people there. But my point is,</v>

25
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.810
um, the choice was like, take this thing,

26
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.970
put it on the side of a rocket ship that you know is growing very quickly.

27
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.800
Like I had seen what had happened when E sold blogger to Google and then Google

28
00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:48.920
went public. Remember we sold before Facebook went public.

29
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.520
There was a moment at which the stock price was $17, by the way,

30
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.160
Facebook stock price was $17. And I remember thinking, what the did I just do?

31
00:01:58.161 --> 00:02:02.440
Right. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; uh, now at 320 ish,

32
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.440
I don't know where we are today, but like, okay.

33
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.630
Like the best thing by the way is like when the stock is

34
00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:13.110
down, everyone calls you a dope and then when it's up,

35
00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:16.710
they also call you a dope. But just for a different reason, &lt;laugh&gt; right.

36
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.350
Like you.

37
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.470
<v 0>Can't win lesson in there somewhere. Yeah. So, but you know,</v>

38
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.310
the choice is to strip yourself to a rocket ship or to build your own, you know,

39
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.020
Mr. Elon built his own, literally with the rocket ship.

40
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.780
That's a difficult choice because, um, there's.

41
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.220
<v 1>A world actually. I would say something different,</v>

42
00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:40.180
which is Elon and others decided to sell PayPal for not

43
00:02:40.181 --> 00:02:42.180
that much. I mean, how much was it about a billion dollars?

44
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.100
I can't remember something like that. Yeah. I mean it was early in, um,

45
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.940
but it's worth a lot more now.

46
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.250
<v 0>Then build a new rocket.</v>

47
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.170
<v 1>Ships. So this is the cool part, right? Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.610
If you are an entrepreneur and you own a controlling stake in the company,

49
00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.000
not only is it really hard to do something else with your life because all of

50
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.120
the, you know,

51
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.560
value is tied up in you as a personality attached to this company. Right.

52
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.160
But if you sell it and you get yourself enough capital and you like have enough

53
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.200
energy, you could do another thing or 10 other things or an Elon's case,

54
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:17.240
like a bunch of other things. I don't know. Like I lost count at this point. Um,

55
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.030
and it might have seemed silly at the time and sure. Like if you look back, man,

56
00:03:23.031 --> 00:03:26.790
PayPal's worth a lot now. Right. But I don't know. Like,

57
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.710
do you think Elon like cares about like, are we gonna buy Pinterest or not?

58
00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:34.790
Like I just, he is, he created a, a, a,

59
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.420
a massive capital that allowed him to do what he wants to do. And awesome.

60
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.660
That's more freeing than anything because when you are an entrepreneur attached

61
00:03:42.661 --> 00:03:46.020
to a company, you gotta stay at the company for a really long time.

62
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.660
It's really hard to remove yourself, but.

63
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.140
<v 0>I'm not sure how much you loved PayPal versus SpaceX and Tesla.</v>

64
00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.180
I have a sense that you love.

65
00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.390
<v 1>Instagram. Yeah. I loved enough to like work for 60 years beyond the detail,</v>

66
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.750
which.

67
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.710
<v 0>Is rare, which is very rare you chose.</v>

68
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.750
<v 1>But can I tell you why? Sure. It's um, please,</v>

69
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.870
there are not a lot of companies that you can be part of where

70
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.470
the popes, like I would like to sign up for your product.

71
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.390
Like I'm not a religious person at all. I'm really not. Um, yeah,

72
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:19.950
but when you go to the Vatican,

73
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.580
you're like walking among giant columns and you're hitting the music and

74
00:04:23.581 --> 00:04:23.880
everything.

75
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.740
And like the Pope walks in and he wants to press the signup button on your

76
00:04:27.741 --> 00:04:30.380
product. Like it's a moment in life. Okay. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um,

77
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.700
no matter what your persuasion, okay.

78
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.180
The number of doors and experiences that, that opened up was it was incredible.

79
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.930
I mean, the people I got to meet at the places I got to go, um,

80
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.970
I assume maybe like a payments company is slightly different. Right.

81
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.010
But that's why, like, it was so fun.

82
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.650
And plus I truly believed we were building such a great product and I loved,

83
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.370
loved the game. It wasn't about money. It was about the game. Do you.

84
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.760
<v 0>Do you think you had the gusts to say no?</v>

85
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.720
Is that so here's I often think about this,

86
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.000
like how hard is it for an entrepreneur to say no,

87
00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:11.120
because the peer pressure. So every,

88
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.840
like basically the sea of entrepreneurs in Silicon valley are gonna tell you,

89
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.560
I mean, this is their dream. The, the, the thing you were sitting before was is,

90
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.430
is a dream to walk away from that is really, it seems like nearly impossible

91
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.390
because Instagram could in 10 years be, you know,

92
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:32.710
you, you could talk about Google,

93
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.510
you could be making self-driving cars and building rockets that go to Mars and

94
00:05:37.511 --> 00:05:39.310
compete with SpaceX. Totally.

95
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.700
And so that's an interesting decision to say, am I willing,

96
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.820
um, to risk it? And, and the reason I also say it's an interesting decision,

97
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.500
because it feels like per our previous discussion, if you're launching a social,

98
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.160
uh, social network company, there's, there's going to be that meeting,

99
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.400
whatever that number is. If you're successful, if,

100
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.200
if you're on this rocket ship of success,

101
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.960
there's going to be a meeting with one of the social media, uh,

102
00:06:07.961 --> 00:06:11.840
social network companies that, that wanna buy you, uh,

103
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:13.240
whether it's Facebook or Twitter,

104
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.430
but it could also very well be Google who seems, have,

105
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.070
have like a graveyard of failed social networks. And it's,

106
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.630
I mean, I don't know. I,

107
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.110
I think about that how difficult it is for an entrepreneur to make that

108
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.110
decision. How many have successfully made that decision,

109
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:35.230
I guess is a big question. It's sad to me, to be honest,

110
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.900
that too many make that decision perhaps for the wrong reason to, to, uh, so.

111
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.020
<v 1>When you say make the decision, you mean to the affirmative, to the affirmative.</v>

112
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.660
Yeah. Got it. Yeah. There are also companies that don't sell. Right.

113
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.260
And take the path and say we're gonna be independent.

114
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.620
And then you've never heard of, again, like I, I remember, uh,

115
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.610
path right. Was one of our competitors early &lt;affirmative&gt;, uh,

116
00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.250
there's a big moment when they had, I can't remember what it was.

117
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.370
It was like 110 million offer from Google or something.

118
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.370
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it might have been larger. I don't know. Um,

119
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.610
and I remember there was like this big tech crunch article that was like,

120
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.450
they turned it down after talking deeply about their values and everything. And

121
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.360
I don't, I don't know the inner workings of Foursquare, but like, I'm certain,

122
00:07:22.361 --> 00:07:25.800
there were many conversations over time where there were companies that wanted

123
00:07:25.801 --> 00:07:29.760
Foursquare as well. Um, recently, like, I mean,

124
00:07:29.761 --> 00:07:33.160
what other companies there's clubhouse, right. Like, I don't know.

125
00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:35.360
Maybe people were really interested in them too.

126
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:40.630
Like there are plenty of moments where people say

127
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.870
no, and we just forget that those things happen.

128
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:48.430
We only focus on the ones where like, uh, uh, they said yes,

129
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:52.390
and like, wow, like what if they had stayed independent? So I don't know.

130
00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.710
I like, I used to think a lot about this now. I just don't because I'm like,

131
00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:00.340
whatever, I &lt;laugh&gt;, you know, like things have gone pretty. Yeah. It's,

132
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.580
I'm ready for the next game. I mean, think about, um,

133
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:07.380
an athlete where I don't know, maybe they, they,

134
00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.940
they do something wrong in the world series or whatever. And like,

135
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:14.740
if you let it haunt you for the rest of your career, like, why not just be like,

136
00:08:14.741 --> 00:08:18.660
I don't know it was a game next game, next shot. Right. And if,

137
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:22.690
if you just move to that world, like at least I have an ex shot. Right?

138
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:26.130
<v 0>No, that that's, that's beautiful, but I mean, just in insights, uh,</v>

139
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:29.170
and it's funny you brought up clubhouse. It, it is very true.

140
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.850
It seems like clubhouse is, um, you know,

141
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:38.250
on the downward path and it's very possible to see a billion plus dollar

142
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:43.240
deal at some stage, maybe like a year ago or half a year ago from Facebook,

143
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:47.120
from Google. I think Facebook was flirting with that idea too. And &lt;laugh&gt;,

144
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:51.320
and I think a lot of companies probably were, I wish it was more public.

145
00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:53.441
You know what?

146
00:08:53.441 --> 00:08:58.400
There's not like a badass public story about them making the decision to

147
00:08:58.401 --> 00:09:01.680
walk away. We just don't hear about it. And then we get to see the,

148
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.400
the results of that success or the failure more often failure.

149
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.080
<v 1>Uh, so a couple things. One is, oh,</v>

150
00:09:08.081 --> 00:09:10.840
not assume clubhouse is down for the count at all. They're young.

151
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:14.080
They have plenty of money. They're run by really smart people. Mm-hmm,

152
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.910
&lt;affirmative&gt;, I'd give them a, like a very fighting chance to figure it out.

153
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:20.830
There are a lot of times when people called Twitter down for the count and they

154
00:09:20.831 --> 00:09:23.590
figure it out and they seem to be doing well. Right. Yeah. Um,

155
00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:27.270
so just backing up, like, and not knowing anything about their internals,

156
00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.590
like there's a strong chance.

157
00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.150
They will figure it out and that people are just down.

158
00:09:32.151 --> 00:09:35.580
Cause they like being down about companies. They like assuming are gonna fail.

159
00:09:35.581 --> 00:09:38.460
So who knows? Right. But let's take the ones in the past where like,

160
00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:39.580
we know how it played out.

161
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:44.020
There are plenty of examples where people have turned down big offers and then

162
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.900
you've just never heard from them again.

163
00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.820
But we never focus on the companies cuz you just forget that those were big,

164
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:54.500
but inside your psyche, I think they're, um,

165
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.930
it, it's easy for someone with enough money to say money doesn't matter,

166
00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:03.610
which I think is, is like it's. Of course money matters to people. Um,

167
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:09.010
but at the moment you just can't even grasp like the number of zeros that you're

168
00:10:09.011 --> 00:10:11.410
talking about. It just doesn't make sense. Right.

169
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:16.680
So to think rationally in that moment is not something many people are up to do,

170
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.600
especially not people where I think we had founded the company a year earlier,

171
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:25.640
maybe two years earlier, like a year and a half. We were 13 people. But,

172
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.800
um, I will say, I still don't know if it was the right decision.

173
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.400
Cause I don't have that counterfactual. I don't know that other world. Yeah.

174
00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:38.710
I'm just thankful that by and most people love Instagram still do

175
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:43.910
by and large people are very happy with like the time we had there. Um,

176
00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:48.670
and I'm proud of what we built. So like I'm cool. Like we're, you know, now,

177
00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:50.310
now it's it's next shot. Right?
