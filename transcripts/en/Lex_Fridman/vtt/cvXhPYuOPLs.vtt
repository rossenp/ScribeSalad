00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.800
<v 0>What, uh, computing hardware or,</v>

2
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.120
um, just any kind of even software design, are you, uh,

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.400
do you find beautiful from your own work from other people's work

4
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.720
that you're just, uh, we were just talking about the,

5
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.710
the battleground of flaws and mistakes and in errors,

6
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.270
but things that were just beautifully done.

7
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.230
Is there something that pops to mind?

8
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.270
<v 1>Well, when things are beautifully done,</v>

9
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.830
usually there's a well set thought set of abstraction layers.

10
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.150
<v 0>So the whole thing works in unison nicely. Yes.</v>

11
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.390
<v 1>And, and when I, when I say abstraction,</v>

12
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.620
like that means two different components. When they work together,

13
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.300
they work independently. They don't have to know what the other one is doing.

14
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.953
<v 0>So that deco.</v>

15
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.860
<v 1>Point. Yeah. So the, the famous one was the, the network stack,</v>

16
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.940
like there's a seven layer network stack, you know, data,

17
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.820
transport and protocol and all the layers. And the innovation was,

18
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.410
is when they really wrote got that. Right. Because networks, before that,

19
00:01:05.411 --> 00:01:06.890
didn't define those very well.

20
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.250
The layers could innovate independently and occasionally the layer boundary

21
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.810
would, would, you know, the interface would be upgraded. And that,

22
00:01:15.811 --> 00:01:18.810
that let you know, the, the design space breathe.

23
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.930
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you could do something new in layer seven without having to

24
00:01:22.931 --> 00:01:24.530
worry about how layer four worked mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

25
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.000
And so good design does that. And you see it in processor designs.

26
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.320
When we did, um, the Zen design at AMD,

27
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.240
we made several components, very modular. And you know,

28
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.760
my insistence at the top was I wanted all the interfaces defined before we wrote

29
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:46.630
the RTL for the pieces. One of the verification leads to if we do this right,

30
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.310
I can test the pieces so well independently, when we put it together,

31
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.590
we won't find all these interaction bugs,

32
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.390
cuz the floating point knows how the cash works. And I was a little skeptical,

33
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.110
but he was mostly right that the,

34
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.390
the modularity designed greatly improved the quality.

35
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.380
<v 0>Is that universally true in general? Would you say about good designs?</v>

36
00:02:06.381 --> 00:02:08.780
The modularity is like, usually we.

37
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.100
<v 1>Talked about this before humans are only so smart, like,</v>

38
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.580
and we're not getting in any smarter. Right.

39
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.540
But the complexity of things is going up. Yeah. So, you know,

40
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.820
a, a beautiful design can't be bigger than the person doing it. It's just,

41
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.020
you know, their piece of it.

42
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.850
Like the odds of you doing a really beautiful design of something that's way too

43
00:02:27.851 --> 00:02:32.450
hard for you is low. Right? If it's way too simple for you,

44
00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:34.810
it's not that interesting. It's like, well, anybody could do that,

45
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.730
but when you get the right match of your, your expertise and you know,

46
00:02:39.731 --> 00:02:43.490
mental power to the right design size, that's cool,

47
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.370
but that's not big enough to make a meaningful impact on the world.

48
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.280
So now you have to have some framework to design the pieces. Yes.

49
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.800
So that the whole thing is big and harmonious, but

50
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.680
you know, when you put it together, it's, you know,

51
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.800
sufficiently interesting to, to be used and you know,

52
00:03:03.801 --> 00:03:05.560
so that's what the beautiful design is.
