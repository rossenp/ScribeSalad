00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.120
<v 0>1996 Olympic games in Atlanta.</v>

2
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.400
Can you take me through the day when you're going for the 62 kg

3
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.120
gold, what did you eat? Drink? What did you think?

4
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.720
<v 1>It really doesn't matter. Um, I have a routine that, you know,</v>

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.920
I had a routine as a competitor that I could run through right now. Um, it,

6
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.910
it was a lot of, self-talk very, very positive. Self-talk visualization. Yes,

7
00:00:27.911 --> 00:00:32.350
visualization. Um, self-talk um, and, and that's how I,

8
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.270
I was able to relax in getting ready for imagines.

9
00:00:35.271 --> 00:00:40.230
<v 2>My whole life learned that very early age at a camp at a developmental camp</v>

10
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.700
at a young age, Terry and I did. And, and, um,

11
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.900
I can tell you what I ate and I can tell you what I did to relax.

12
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.740
And it doesn't matter. Uh, what you have to do is you have to find that piece.

13
00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.020
And I just know that when I was getting ready for the finals match,

14
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.930
I had gone back to my room. I had my relaxed material, you know,

15
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.290
and I was able to relax because I prepared for.

16
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.290
<v 0>It. Hopefully I'm right on this.</v>

17
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.170
But just looking at the insane bracket you had to go through,

18
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.330
you had to beat just to get to the finals to be three world champions,

19
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.770
eventually world champ. I mean, Dave, and.

20
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.890
<v 1>And you know what, I don't talk about that. And nobody else does it either,</v>

21
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.880
but everybody talks about it in their own career.

22
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.440
So now you're making my head big &lt;laugh&gt;. But yeah, I had a road.

23
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.160
I had a road you're right.

24
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.040
<v 0>That is the hardest bracket I've seen.</v>

25
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.040
So I've talked to a lot of Olympic champions that is the hardest bracket I've

26
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:41.280
seen of any champions. So, uh, maybe I'm confused on this,

27
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.920
but it seemed like a really tough day for you. Did you have,

28
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.710
did you know the bracket ahead of time? Did you know who you faced?

29
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.750
<v 1>You, you see the draw and it's a two day tournament.</v>

30
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.550
So psychology comes into it as much as physical shape.

31
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.590
Um, you know, because there's those, you gotta sleep, you know,

32
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.230
the night before after the way, and then you gotta sleep again.

33
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.180
<v 2>That next night after your semi-final math is gonna be in the morning, you know,</v>

34
00:02:08.181 --> 00:02:11.420
and then you have to go back and rest cuz your final matche isn't until whatever

35
00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:12.780
time it was. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

36
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.460
And so all this relaxation and all that stuff that you just talked about,

37
00:02:16.461 --> 00:02:19.180
that visualization itself talked that's what helps since your routine?

38
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.020
<v 0>Is there any doubt, any fear, any, anything.</v>

39
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.970
<v 1>There? The fear is that type of fear.</v>

40
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.250
And I just talked about this to one of my athletes today. Um,

41
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.450
Jack Dempsey talked about fear and the fear of losing is what motivated him

42
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.130
to try to take his opponents head off. He was a boxer and um,

43
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.930
that's okay. So fear of competition, fear of screwing up fear of,

44
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.000
I don't feel good. No, no, but that little fear that, you know, what,

45
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:54.600
there's somebody out there that thinks that, you know what they they're gonna,

46
00:02:54.601 --> 00:02:57.960
they're gonna revel in my they're gonna, they're gonna,

47
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.200
they're gonna eat it up in my misery. They're gonna love,

48
00:03:01.201 --> 00:03:05.760
they're gonna be thriving because I fail and, and I'm not gonna let that happen.
