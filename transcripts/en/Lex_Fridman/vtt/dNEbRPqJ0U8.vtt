00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.360
<v 0>Do you think Bin Laden is evil? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, he was a,</v>

2
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.160
a mass murderer. Um, I'm just saying that, you know, his ideas were,

3
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.760
they're more complex than, than we've tended to acknowledge. Um, they had,

4
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.040
they have a wider potential resonance than we would acknowledge. I mean,

5
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.830
and also, I guess what, I'm the just one fundamental point is that, um,

6
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.510
thinking about the complexity of bin Laden is also a way of removing him from

7
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.353
Islam.

8
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.310
<v 1>Um, he is not an Islamic thinker.</v>

9
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.310
He is a cosmopolitan thinker who plays in all kinds of

10
00:00:39.311 --> 00:00:43.110
modern ideologies, which have proven to mobilize people in the past. Right?

11
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.660
So &lt;affirmative&gt;, um, you know, antisemitism, um, populism,

12
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.700
environmentalism, and the kind of, and the, the urging to like, you know,

13
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.820
do something about humanity, do something about suffering.

14
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.260
That's why I think the actual,

15
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.500
you ask about like what motivates people to do this kind of stuff.

16
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.100
<v 0>I think that's why if one goes below the level of leadership,</v>

17
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.860
and this is being reported, if you look at the,

18
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.210
the trial ongoing now in Paris of, uh,

19
00:01:08.211 --> 00:01:10.610
the Lon murders, I think, um,

20
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.650
the court allowed some discussion of the backgrounds of the accused and they

21
00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:19.410
come from different backgrounds. But if there's any common bond,

22
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:21.850
it's kind of that they had some background in,

23
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.440
in petty crime famously in the seventh set and bombings in London,

24
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.000
the metropolitan police, you know, the UK authorities looked at all those guys.

25
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.160
And what people want is this idea that like, they must be very pious.

26
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.680
They must be, you know, super Islamic to do this kind of stuff.

27
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.920
They must be fanatical, true believers.

28
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.800
But what they found with those guys was that some were

29
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.030
Noy Muslim, some went to mosques, some didn't, um,

30
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.510
some were single young guys with like criminal backgrounds. Some,

31
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.830
you know, were like, sorry, they were, you know,

32
00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:03.070
kind of misfits who never succeeded in anything. Uh, but others had, you know,

33
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.340
at least one thing had a wife and family who he, you know, widowed and orphaned.

34
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.580
And so there's no, I mean, for policing, I mean,

35
00:02:10.581 --> 00:02:11.700
if you're looking at to that lens,

36
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.340
there is no kind of typology that will predict who will become violent.

37
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.060
And that's why I think we have to move beyond thinking about religious

38
00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:24.740
augmentation narrowly or by itself, and think about things like geopolitics,

39
00:02:24.741 --> 00:02:28.850
think about how people respond to inequality, you know, the,

40
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.770
the existential threat of, of CRI of, of, you know, climate crisis of,

41
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.010
um, a whole host of matters of, and,

42
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.810
and think about this is a mode of political contestation. I mean,

43
00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:42.970
it's a violent one. It's one I can condemn 'em it is evil, right? But it,

44
00:02:42.971 --> 00:02:45.050
these are people that are, they're trying to be political.

45
00:02:45.051 --> 00:02:48.640
They're trying to change things in some way. It's not nearly about like,

46
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.760
I wanna impose sure. Law on you, you know, you must wear a veil,

47
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.440
you must eat this kind of food. It's, it's not that parochial.
