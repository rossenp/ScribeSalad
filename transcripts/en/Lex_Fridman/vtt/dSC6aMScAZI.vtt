00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:08.190
<v 0>Do you think one day it will be possible to simulate the full</v>

2
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.950
history that took our solar system to what it is today?

3
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.150
<v 1>Yes. And it will be useless. &lt;laugh&gt; okay.</v>

4
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.230
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; so you don't think your story,</v>

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.110
many of the ideas that you have about Jupiter are clear in the space like

6
00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:25.020
retelling that or in high resolution is not that important.

7
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.660
<v 1>I actually think it's important, but at every stage you have to,</v>

8
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.500
you have to SIM you have to design your experiments, your,

9
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.620
your numerical computer experiments,

10
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.180
so that they test some specific aspect of that evolution.

11
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.420
Got it. Um,

12
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.250
I am a proponent of doing huge simulations because,

13
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.163
um,

14
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.850
even if we forget the information theory aspect of not being

15
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.970
able, mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; to simulate in full detail the universe,

16
00:00:57.971 --> 00:01:01.010
because if you do, then you,

17
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.000
you have made an actual universe. It's not the simulation,

18
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.120
right by simulation is in some sense,

19
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.880
a compression mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; of information.

20
00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:13.800
So therefore you lose must lose detail, but that point aside,

21
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.080
if we are able to simulate the entire

22
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.720
history of the solar system in excruciating detail, I mean, it'll be cool,

23
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.510
but it's not gonna be any different from observing it. Right.

24
00:01:29.511 --> 00:01:32.550
Right. Because theoretical understanding,

25
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.110
which is what ultimately I'm interested in, um,

26
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.710
comes from taking complex things and reducing them down to something

27
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.711
that, you know,

28
00:01:42.711 --> 00:01:46.340
some mechanism mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that you can actually quantify fine. Um,

29
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.500
that's the, that's the fun part of astrophysics,

30
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.020
just kind of simulating things in extreme detail is, well, cool.

31
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.580
We'll make cool visualizations,

32
00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.620
but that doesn't get to doesn't doesn't get you to any better understanding

33
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.940
than you had before you did the.

34
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.250
<v 0>Simulation. If you ask very specific questions, then you'll be to, uh,</v>

35
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.930
create like very highly compressed, nice,

36
00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:13.010
beautiful theories about how things evolved.

37
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.210
And then you can use those to then generalize to other solar systems, to, uh,

38
00:02:17.211 --> 00:02:19.130
other stars and other galaxies,

39
00:02:19.131 --> 00:02:22.490
and then say something generalizable about the entire universe.

40
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.450
How difficult would it be to simulate

41
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.080
our solar systems such that we would not know the difference,

42
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.320
meaning if we are living in a simulation,

43
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.360
is there a nice think of it as a video game? Sure.

44
00:02:37.361 --> 00:02:41.440
Is there a nice compressible way of doing that or just kind of like you

45
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.400
intuitive with a three body situation is just a giant mess that you cannot

46
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.270
create a video game that, uh,

47
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.830
will seem realistic without actually building.

48
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.030
<v 1>It or scratch I'm, you know, I'm speculating, but &lt;laugh&gt; one, one of the,</v>

49
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.000
yeah, I know, I know you, like, you have a deep understanding of this,

50
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.160
about like my, for me, I'm, I'm just gonna like speculate that for, um,

51
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.680
at least in the types of simulations that we can do today,

52
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.160
inevitably you run into the problem of resolution, right?

53
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.990
You are doesn't matter what you're doing. It is discreet now. Um,

54
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.630
the way you would go about asking, you know, what we're observing,

55
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:28.950
is that a simulation or, uh, or is that, you know,

56
00:03:28.951 --> 00:03:33.870
some real continuous thing, uh, is you, you zoom in, right.

57
00:03:33.871 --> 00:03:38.470
You zoom in and try and find the, you know, the grid scale,

58
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.940
if you will. Yeah. Um, yeah, I mean,

59
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.580
it's a, it's a really interesting, it's a really interesting question.

60
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.740
And because the solar system itself,

61
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.980
and really, you know, the double pendulum is chaotic, right?

62
00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.460
Pendulum sitting on another pen,

63
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.690
it moves unpredictably. Once you let them go. Um,

64
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.210
you really don't need to like inject any randomness into a simulation for

65
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:13.290
it to, to give you stochastic and unpredictable answers.

66
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.850
Whether is a great example of this, whether has a lap enough time of,

67
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.560
you know, typical weather systems have a happen of time of a few days. I mean,

68
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:27.880
there's a fundamental reason why the for forecast always sucks,

69
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.800
you know, two weeks in advance.

70
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.400
It's not that we don't know the equations that govern

71
00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.160
the atmosphere. We know them well, their solutions are meaningless though.

72
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:39.994
After a few days.

73
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.310
<v 0>The zooming in thing is very interesting.</v>
