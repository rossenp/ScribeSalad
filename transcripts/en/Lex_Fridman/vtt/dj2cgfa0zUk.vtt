00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.250
<v 0>You did a bunch of programming competitions.</v>

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.050
What was your interest, your love for programming? Uh,

3
00:00:11.051 --> 00:00:12.690
what did you learn through that experience,

4
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.490
especially now that as much as your work has taken a long journey through

5
00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:18.324
mathematics?

6
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.800
<v 1>I think I always was amazed by how computers could do through things fast.</v>

7
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.320
If I wanted to make it an abstract analysis of why it is that I saw some

8
00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:30.280
power in the computer,

9
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.920
because if the computer can do things so many times faster than humans,

10
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.560
where the hard part is telling the computer what to do and how to do it,

11
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.080
if you can master that, asking the computer, what to do,

12
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.280
then you could conceivably achieve more things.

13
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.550
&lt;affirmative&gt; and those contests I was in,

14
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.910
those were the opposite in some sense of making a complete product.

15
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.910
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like a game is a product. Uh,

16
00:00:51.911 --> 00:00:54.030
those contests were effectively right.

17
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.390
A function to do something extremely efficiently.

18
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.390
And if you are able to do that,

19
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.790
then you can unlock more of the power of the computer.

20
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.270
<v 0>But also doing it quickly.</v>

21
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.020
There's a time out element from the human perspective to,

22
00:01:06.021 --> 00:01:10.700
to be able to program quickly. There's something nice.

23
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.720
So there's an, like,

24
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.740
almost like an athletics component to where you're almost like, uh,

25
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.980
an athlete seeking optimal performance as a human being,

26
00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:22.460
trying to write these programs. And at the same time,

27
00:01:22.461 --> 00:01:26.610
it's kind of art because you're the best way to write a program quickly

28
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.890
is to write a simple program is to have a good solution.

29
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.610
So it's not necessarily, you have to type fast,

30
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.130
you have to think through a really clean, beautiful, uh,

31
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.210
solution. I mean,

32
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.450
what do you think is the use of those programming competitions?

33
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.720
Do you think there are ultimately some that you would recommend for students,

34
00:01:46.721 --> 00:01:49.600
for people interested in programming or people interested in building stuff?

35
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.880
Yes.

36
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.200
<v 1>I think so. Because especially with the work that I've been doing nowadays,</v>

37
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.960
even trying to control COVID something that was very helpful from day one was

38
00:01:58.961 --> 00:02:02.520
understanding that the kinds of computations we would want to do,

39
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.560
we could conceivably do on like a four core,

40
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.910
a cloud machine on Amazon web services,

41
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:12.030
out to a population which might have hundreds of thousands or millions of

42
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:12.570
people.

43
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.470
The reason why that was important to have that back of the envelope calculation

44
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.710
with efficient algorithms is because if we couldn't do that,

45
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.430
then we would bankrupt ourselves before we could get to a big enough scale. Uh,

46
00:02:24.431 --> 00:02:27.260
if you think about how you grow anything from small to big,

47
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.700
if in order to grow up from small to big,

48
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.500
you also already need 10,000 cloud servers. You'll never get to big.

49
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.460
<v 0>And also the nice thing about programming competitions is that you actually</v>

50
00:02:39.461 --> 00:02:43.860
build a thing that, uh, works so you, uh, you finish it,

51
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.980
there's a completion thing and you realize,

52
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.010
I think there's a magic to it where you realize that it's not so hard to build

53
00:02:52.011 --> 00:02:55.010
something that works to have a system that, uh,

54
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.730
successfully takes in inputs and produces outputs and solves a difficult

55
00:02:58.731 --> 00:02:59.540
problem.

56
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.520
And that directly transfers to building a startup essentially that can help some

57
00:03:04.521 --> 00:03:07.760
aspect of this world as long as it's mostly be. Um,

58
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.600
based on software engineering,

59
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.560
things get really tricky when you have to manufacture stuff

60
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.160
that that's why people like Elon Musk so impressive that they,

61
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.190
it's not just software Tesla, autopilot is just not just software.

62
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.390
It it's like you have to actually like have factories that build, uh, cars.

63
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.510
And there's like a million components in involved in,

64
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.910
in the machinery required to assemble those cars and so on. But in software,

65
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.110
one person can change the world, which is, uh, uh, incredible.
