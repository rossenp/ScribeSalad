1
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.120
<v 0>You mentioned God God's spelled backwards is dog</v>

2
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.830
how's that for a transition and a, you know,

3
00:00:11.831 --> 00:00:16.830
a Musk and a Tesla are at least a little bit curious about

4
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.620
a coin called dos coin, right?

5
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.040
You made a video directed to Ilan on how to improve Dorsch coin.

6
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.350
What are your ideas for making doge coin even better than it

7
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:29.184
already is?

8
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.680
<v 1>Well, you know, don't you go and just base,</v>

9
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.310
it's a F it's like that nine inch nails song, a copy of a copy of a copy.

10
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.940
It's just a copy of a copy. It's a Bitcoin gave light coin,

11
00:00:38.941 --> 00:00:42.060
light coin gave doge coin and it was kind of a parody cryptocurrency.

12
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:45.600
And I think Jackson was trying to do it to like prove a point about all coins

13
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.370
and then true to form,

14
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.700
like nobody caught the doctrine and completely perverted the entire religion.

15
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.150
It's almost like the emperor of man and Warhammer 40 caves like this atheist

16
00:00:54.151 --> 00:00:54.901
don't worship me.

17
00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:57.390
And now there's like this whole religion built around the emperor.

18
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.850
So doge coin has become a thing and it's become such a large thing that it is a

19
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:06.180
reasonable target for somebody to fix it up and repair it and make it an

20
00:01:06.181 --> 00:01:07.410
interesting cryptocurrency.

21
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.730
The point of the video was to show what a modern third-generation cryptocurrency

22
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:12.750
really would require.

23
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.290
It's a major overhaul and there are already people doing this, you know,

24
00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:20.490
there's the Solanas and the harmony ones and the Kardos Neos and all these other

25
00:01:20.491 --> 00:01:20.761
guys.

26
00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:24.450
And they have billions of dollars and huge dev teams and all these innovative

27
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:27.840
protocols. If you're really serious about this thing, sticking around,

28
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.030
being useful in doing stuff,

29
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.600
then the point of the video was to show the types of things you'd have to think

30
00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:37.440
about and the types of papers that are all open source, patent free,

31
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.620
and don't have any notion of intellectual property behind them that his

32
00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:42.960
engineers could grab and go and do.

33
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.400
And he did mention on Twitter that he was looking for feedback on how to improve

34
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.670
doge. And so I said, all right, well, I'll just put all these things together.

35
00:01:50.671 --> 00:01:53.820
It was a little tongue in cheek because I figured he'd ignore it. Uh,

36
00:01:53.821 --> 00:01:58.350
but it was also showing how hard it is to innovate in this tire space. You know,

37
00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:02.430
you don't just go and say, I'm going to go build a battery power car or rocket,

38
00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:05.190
or enter a new industry. It's really hard to do that.

39
00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:07.110
You spend years and lots of effort.

40
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.720
You have to do series of small learning steps.

41
00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:13.230
You have to pick up destroyed rockets on the side of the beach and things like

42
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:17.040
that before you get to the rocket landing itself. Well, analogously,

43
00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:18.900
it's really hard to build a cryptocurrency

44
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.310
Satoshi probably spent years thinking carefully,

45
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.720
and that work was a derivative of 30 years of work and the digital assets based

46
00:02:27.721 --> 00:02:30.990
starting the 1980s working its way through. So,

47
00:02:30.991 --> 00:02:35.280
and then Bitcoin only did very limited things relative to what Ethereum can do

48
00:02:35.281 --> 00:02:39.630
or Cartano can do and so forth. So the minute that you extend that complexity,

49
00:02:39.631 --> 00:02:43.050
you're talking about years of R and D years of engineering effort that needs to

50
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:47.310
be done. So what's the point of doge? Is it just a meme? Uh,

51
00:02:47.311 --> 00:02:51.780
is it actually contending to be useful or is it a competing as a store value

52
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.020
against Bitcoin? Now, if it's competing as a store value against Bitcoin,

53
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.060
why the hell does it have the monetary policy?

54
00:02:57.061 --> 00:03:00.880
It does also there's predatory distribution of the underlying asset.

55
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:05.080
And over 90 some percent is consolidated less than 1% of the holders for dose,

56
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.750
for doge coin at a very, very low price point.

57
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.250
So they can sell at almost any price point and make a profit. So, you know,

58
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:14.750
it hits 50 cents. They're they're billionaires, and,

59
00:03:14.751 --> 00:03:17.800
and it's not like 20,000 people.

60
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:20.650
It's probably less than a hundred wallets that have that distribution.

61
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.020
So there's this existential ticking time bomb.

62
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:26.440
That's in dojo that once the guys who were vested start selling,

63
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.760
they can just keep selling.

64
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:30.580
It keeps selling it right at all the way down and make windfall profits,

65
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:31.990
regardless of what price they sell out.

66
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.530
And who are they selling against the retail investors? You know,

67
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.970
people make $500 spare money a month or something like that.

68
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.810
And it bothers me because I see it in my community. So I live in Longmont,

69
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.943
Colorado,

70
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.670
and I was at a restaurant and I was talking to the waitress and she asked me

71
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:51.460
what business I, and I said, I'm in the cryptocurrency space. And she's like,

72
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:54.490
what is that? And I started explaining all of it. And she says, oh yeah,

73
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.240
I own some doge coin. I said, you want anything else? No, no.

74
00:03:58.241 --> 00:04:00.820
I just bought them too. Why did you buy doge? Oh, it's not yelling,

75
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.120
keep tweeting about it. And I thought it was a good deal, you know?

76
00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:07.660
So when you see stuff like that, where people have no clue what they're doing,

77
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.210
they don't really understand the supply dynamics,

78
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:14.920
the ownership dynamics and these types of things. And then when the clock stops,

79
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.900
you know, they're, they're the ones who get hurt.

80
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.050
And then the regulator comes in and the Elizabeth Warren's of the world and they

81
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:23.560
say, see, this is an evidence. These guys can't regulate themselves,

82
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:27.100
control themselves. We need to control everything either let's ban it,

83
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.760
or let's just announce that the only three are legitimate. And, and, you know,

84
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:33.520
every one of them has to be connected to identity and raw.

85
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.390
And I'm just very concerned that that's a bad thing to do.

86
00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:40.060
And that's why I've been so vocal about this topic.

87
00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:44.590
And my hope is that a compromise can be made where real developers come in and

88
00:04:44.591 --> 00:04:47.560
they start working on doge and they find a way to create some sort of use and

89
00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:51.550
utility for it. So at least it has a value floor and the, you know.

90
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.630
<v 0>Is it possible for Cardona and dose going to work together somehow?</v>

91
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.850
<v 1>Yeah, that'd be a lot of fun. Uh, you know, I,</v>

92
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.880
I'm not adverse to the idea of cleaning up the code base,

93
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.710
but legitimately whoever comes in be two years or three years of work, you know,

94
00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:07.060
cause you have to do real stuff.

95
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.800
And that code is like light coin circa 20 12, 13.

96
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.750
<v 0>Well, the interesting thing about Ian,</v>

97
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.580
I've got to interact with him quite a bit.

98
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.780
That combination of humor and extreme ambition,

99
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.170
like in the face of the impossible odds is something he does really well.

100
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.090
And so I think that's the spirit of Dorsch coin is

101
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.140
fun and almost like bold,

102
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.090
ambitious innovation. And so I think you can't discount the power of that.

103
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.420
<v 1>But where's the innovation what's the, this is step one.</v>

104
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.610
What's going to Mars for coach coin.

105
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.910
<v 0>Well, I mean he came, he came in the same way to, uh,</v>

106
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.780
to rock as he came in the same way with, uh, two, uh, two electric cars.

107
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.360
It was seemed impossible at first,

108
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.290
but you step in and you solve the problems first principles one at a time, but.

109
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.650
<v 1>I'll tell you a little bit on this because I think he had some trends though,</v>

110
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.920
that he was very smart to recognize the case of battery power cars. He said,

111
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:06.680
hang on, everybody has tablets and cell phones and these other things.

112
00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:10.370
And there's an incentive to make batteries better, faster, cheaper,

113
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:12.950
and charge faster. And that's connected to mobile computing.

114
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.270
So we're regardless if you want battery power cars or not every year,

115
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:22.160
you have billions of dollars of R and D being pushed to force this capacity to

116
00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:25.250
evolve. And he's just getting on the train and piggybacking on that.

117
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.270
So that was a brilliant business acumen to recognize that in the case of SpaceX,

118
00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:31.820
it was just obvious question. If every time you get on a plane,

119
00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:34.310
you have to throw the plan away. No one would fly.

120
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.750
So reusability is like a fundamental thing that if you solve that,

121
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.890
you've now opened space up to a complete new class of commercialization.

122
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.430
I don't see the problem in doge coin because if he was looking for it,

123
00:06:46.431 --> 00:06:49.790
then why not look at a real platform actually trying to solve a real problem.

124
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.450
There are so many of them, there he is. He throw a rock,

125
00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:56.900
he can hit 15 of these guys and they'd all die to work with you and Musk.

126
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.730
<v 0>Yeah, it was very interesting. I mean,</v>

127
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.260
so first I could continue pushing back on your intuition about, uh,

128
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.570
electric cars and batteries and so on. I don't think it's,

129
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.160
it's more obvious in retrospect than it is in, um, at the time I would say,

130
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.650
because I would agree with you on the batteries front.

131
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.340
I wouldn't necessarily get really with the electric car because first of all,

132
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.250
nobody's started a successful car company from, for decades.

133
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.720
<v 1>But it was the loyalty, the four guys or whatever it was with GM.</v>

134
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:26.780
They didn't want to give them back when they had the lease program.

135
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.110
<v 0>There's some basic intuition that there is some hunger here,</v>

136
00:07:30.111 --> 00:07:33.500
but it's not obvious that you can do it successfully and would relaunching

137
00:07:33.501 --> 00:07:38.030
rockets for cheap. That's not, that sounds good on paper, but to do it well,

138
00:07:38.031 --> 00:07:42.110
NASA is spending way more money for this. And, uh, uh,

139
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.100
the Russians were not selling any rocket. Like you said,

140
00:07:45.101 --> 00:07:47.840
you have to do it all yourself from scratch. How do you build the team?

141
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.270
How do you do, uh, how do you launch rockets? When if you fail a few times,

142
00:07:53.271 --> 00:07:55.250
you're going to go bankrupt, right? I mean, it's just,

143
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.700
business-wise I would rather build a nap, like angry boats.

144
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.600
<v 1>I got this launch rock. You've got to give him credit. He got folders for balls.</v>

145
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.740
<v 0>Thank you for that. But I don't, I maybe that's what I mean.</v>

146
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.980
I think there's not enough first principle thinking on the cryptocurrency side.

147
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:17.300
I think I agree with you on that,

148
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:22.640
but there's some aspect to which the seriousness of the cryptocurrency

149
00:08:22.641 --> 00:08:26.840
world is paralyzing. So in some way,

150
00:08:26.841 --> 00:08:30.890
the innovation that you spoke to requires, uh,

151
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:34.250
taking risks requires not taking everything so seriously,

152
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:37.520
like being afraid to take those bold risks in the space of ideas,

153
00:08:37.521 --> 00:08:41.000
not in the space of financials. So in that way,

154
00:08:41.001 --> 00:08:45.620
I think that's one pro for Bitcoin is,

155
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:49.010
um, there's room. It's hungry for innovation,

156
00:08:49.011 --> 00:08:51.500
but I think Cardona in that same way as hungry for innovation,

157
00:08:51.501 --> 00:08:56.340
just because you said with some more rigor, formalism behind it,

158
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.060
uh, and even the Ethereum has a, has a hunger for innovation.

159
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.340
That's where Bitcoin is a little bit more, um,

160
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.180
I would say conservative in terms of how much innovating they're willing to do,

161
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:06.960
uh,

162
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.160
in terms of the incentives they built into the systems for the evolution of the

163
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:13.890
cryptocurrency. But yeah, I mean,

164
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.900
it's difficult to psychoanalyze why Dorsch coin is the thing that excites Ilan

165
00:09:18.901 --> 00:09:23.490
so much, but at the same time, there's some power to the fun.

166
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.530
It sounds ridiculous to say, but the fun, the, this,

167
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.250
this idea that, um, you know,

168
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:36.690
the most entertaining outcome is the most likely, right? It,

169
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.170
there could be something built into the physics of the universe that makes that

170
00:09:40.171 --> 00:09:43.140
true because you know, the,

171
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:47.130
the viral nature of fun.

172
00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:52.230
<v 1>As power, it's a neural science thing. We liked dopamine.</v>

173
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:57.070
We like these, these chemicals in our brain, you know, and we have fun.

174
00:09:57.071 --> 00:09:58.000
We want more of it.

175
00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:02.680
So you tend to gravitate towards work activities and play activities that are

176
00:10:02.681 --> 00:10:04.720
enjoyable to you. And, uh, it,

177
00:10:04.721 --> 00:10:09.670
it is nice sometimes to kind of come in and troll an entire industry. Yeah.

178
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.660
I can imagine he's probably having the time of his life is the same as like, uh,

179
00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.780
taking Tesla private at four 20. Yeah. That kind of stuff.

180
00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.870
And it's one thing when you do it with friends,

181
00:10:19.871 --> 00:10:22.720
it's another thing when you deal with a whole industry and it hurts people

182
00:10:22.721 --> 00:10:26.980
financially. Uh, and also I understand he, he hates short sellers and there's,

183
00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:30.400
there's some things there and I can't speak for him because I only know the guy

184
00:10:30.401 --> 00:10:31.840
from a distance. It's just,

185
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:35.560
I live in this space and I have to deal with the consequences and clean up the

186
00:10:35.561 --> 00:10:36.760
mess. You feel the pain.

187
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.480
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

188
00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.880
<v 1>And it results in a regulatory event. It's like,</v>

189
00:10:39.881 --> 00:10:43.180
I'm the guy who has to put on a suit and go to Washington and go and sit in a

190
00:10:43.181 --> 00:10:45.970
Senate inquiry and all this stuff. And he's the guy that, you know,

191
00:10:45.971 --> 00:10:49.660
just like laugh with his friends about how he crashed the crypto market and how

192
00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:52.870
easy it was to do it. And that's, that's my only, uh,

193
00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.620
umbrage about this on the other hand, you know, if it brings a lot of cool, new,

194
00:10:56.621 --> 00:11:00.310
interesting things and people into the space, that's a net positive. And so,

195
00:11:00.311 --> 00:11:02.800
you know, it's not university bad or universally good.

196
00:11:02.801 --> 00:11:05.440
And I like to give people the benefit of the doubt.

197
00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:10.510
And so I'm really hopeful to see what comes about this recent surge of interest.

198
00:11:10.511 --> 00:11:14.470
And if Elan actually puts his money where his mouth is and take some of his

199
00:11:14.471 --> 00:11:19.330
enormous engineering talent and capital and starts contributing and building

200
00:11:19.331 --> 00:11:22.600
something in the cryptocurrency space, be really cool to see that happen.
