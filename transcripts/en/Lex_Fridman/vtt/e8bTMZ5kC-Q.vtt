1
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:08.130
<v 0>If we have to simulate the entire universe to create the ornaments and the two</v>

2
00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:12.690
of us, how are we supposed to create engineer life?

3
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.730
Yeah. That's.

4
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.410
<v 1>Uh, in the lab, this goes back to sort of the critique of the RNA world.</v>

5
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.290
I think one of the problems and, and I'll get to answer your question,

6
00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:22.050
but I think this is kind of relevant here. Mm-hmm,

7
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.720
&lt;affirmative&gt; one of the problems with the R RNA world. Um,

8
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.160
when we test it in the laboratory is how much information we're putting into the

9
00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:32.880
experiment. Um, we specify the Flass. We make pure reagents, we mix them,

10
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.320
we take them out, we put them in the next flask. We change the pH,

11
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.680
we change the UV light,

12
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.000
and then we get a molecule and it's not even an RNA molecule necessarily.

13
00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:42.880
It might just be a base. Right. Um,

14
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.790
and so people don't usually think about the fact that we're agents in the

15
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.830
universe making that experiment.

16
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.310
And therefore we put a little bit of life into that experiment, um,

17
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.470
because it's part of our biological lineage in the same sense that a couple or I

18
00:00:57.471 --> 00:00:59.630
am a part of the biological lineage, the experiment is.

19
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.310
<v 0>Our ideas are injecting life yes.</v>

20
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.900
<v 1>To the, and the constraints that we put on the experiments,</v>

21
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.780
because those conditions wouldn't exist in the universe on planet earth at that

22
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:12.780
time, without us as the boundary condition. Right. So.

23
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.460
<v 0>Um, even though we're not actually adding any actual,</v>

24
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.340
like chemistry or biology that it could be identified as life are the

25
00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:23.380
constraints we're adding to the experiment, the design of the experiment. Yeah.

26
00:01:23.381 --> 00:01:23.740
You can think.

27
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.650
<v 1>Of the design experiment, a program, you put information in it's,</v>

28
00:01:26.651 --> 00:01:30.530
it's an algorithmic procedure that you design the experiment. And so, um,

29
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.250
so the origin life problem becomes one of minimizing the information we put

30
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.130
into physics, right. To actually watch the spontaneous origin life.

31
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.490
<v 0>Can we, can we have, so can,</v>

32
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.890
is it possible in the lab to have an information vacuum then? So like if.

33
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.480
<v 1>We could, we would, that would be amazing. I don't know.</v>

34
00:01:47.481 --> 00:01:49.360
That's a good question for more for Lee.

35
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.760
<v 0>Yeah. You guys, by the way, for people who don't know Lee CRO is, uh,</v>

36
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.440
you guys are, uh, colleagues. Yeah. And, uh, &lt;laugh&gt;,

37
00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.680
I've gotten the chance to listen to the two of you talking.

38
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.080
There's great sort of chemistry and you brilliant brainstorming together.

39
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.950
And there's, there's a really exciting community hear of, of, uh,

40
00:02:06.951 --> 00:02:10.270
brilliant people from different disciplines working on the problem. Yeah.

41
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.470
Of life of complexity of, uh, I don't know,

42
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.190
whatever the &lt;laugh&gt; the words fail us to describe the exact problem.

43
00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:19.990
We're trying to actually understand your intelligence,

44
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.950
all those kinds of things. Okay. So what, what, uh,

45
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.500
from a lab perspective, so Lee, I guess, would you call him a chemist?

46
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.140
<v 1>No, I think by training he's a chemist,</v>

47
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.740
but I think most of the people that work in the field,

48
00:02:33.741 --> 00:02:35.140
we do have lost their discipline.

49
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.260
&lt;laugh&gt; that's why I can't answer your question or whatever. &lt;laugh&gt; OK.

50
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.700
I dunno what you call him. Yeah. I dunno what I call myself.

51
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.060
I don't know what I call any of my friends.

52
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.130
<v 0>So why, why is it so hard to create, uh,</v>

53
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.730
and it's an interesting question to create biological life in the lab.

54
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.010
Like from your perspective, is that an important problem to work on,

55
00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.800
to try to recreate the historical of life on earth

56
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.640
or echoes of the historical.

57
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.760
<v 1>Origin? I think echoes is more appropriate.</v>

58
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.400
I don't think asking the question of what was the exact historical sequence of

59
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:14.160
events and engineering every step in the process to make exactly the chemistry

60
00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:17.720
of life on earth. As we know, it is a meaningful way of asking the question,

61
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.310
right. And it's a little bit like, um, you know, if,

62
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.910
since you're in computer science, like if you know the answer to a problem,

63
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.070
it's all, it's easier to find a program to specify the output. Right.

64
00:03:28.071 --> 00:03:30.430
But if you don't know the answer, our priority, you know,

65
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:33.670
finding an algorithm for like say finding a prime or something, it's easy to,

66
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.790
um, you know, uh, verify it's a prime number.

67
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.700
It's hard to find the next prime and, uh,

68
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.060
the way the original life is structured right now.

69
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.580
And the historical problem is, you know,

70
00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:48.940
the answer and you're trying to retro predict it by breaking it down into the

71
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:51.140
set of procedures where you're putting a lot of information in.

72
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.500
And what we need to do is ask the question of how is it that the rules

73
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.780
of how our universe is structured, permits,

74
00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:01.810
things like life to exist and what is the phenomena of life.

75
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.530
And those questions are obviously essentially the same question.

76
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.730
And so you're looking essentially for this missing physics,

77
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.690
this missing explanation for what we are,

78
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.850
and you need to set up proper experiments that are gonna allow you to probe the

79
00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:20.640
vast complexity of chemistry in an unconstrained way with as little information

80
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.640
put in as possible to see when things,

81
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.120
when does information actually emerge, how does it emerge? What is it? Um,

82
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.040
and, um, part of the,

83
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.040
the sort of conjecture we have is that this physics only becomes relevant,

84
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.000
or at least this is, this is my personal conjecture and, um, and is sort of, uh,

85
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:44.590
validated by this kind of theory, experiment collaboration, um, that we,

86
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.990
we have working in this area, um, that this, you know, sort of,

87
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.390
I made the point about like gravity existing, everywhere, right.

88
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.350
But when you study, um, an atomic nucleus, you don't care about gravity.

89
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.310
It's not relevant physics there, right. It's, it's weak, it doesn't matter. Um,

90
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.220
and so, uh, this idea that,

91
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.900
that there's kind of a physics associated with information, um, for me, um,

92
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.220
it's very evident that that physics doesn't become relevant until you need

93
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.380
information to specify the existence of a particular object.

94
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.060
And the scale of reality,

95
00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:20.820
where that happens is in chemistry because of the commonatorial diversity of

96
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.450
chemical checks that can exist far out,

97
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.330
se exceeds the amount of resources in our universe. So if you wanna,

98
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.530
you can't make every possible protein of length, um, you know,

99
00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:34.930
200 amino acids. There's not enough resources. So in order to,

100
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.050
for this particular protein to exist,

101
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.690
and this protein to exist in high abundance means that you have to have a system

102
00:05:41.691 --> 00:05:44.640
that has knowledge of the existence of that protein and can build it.

103
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.880
<v 0>So existence comes to be at the chemical level. So existence is most, uh,</v>

104
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.600
is, uh, best understood at the chemical level.

105
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:53.663
<v 1>It's most evident.</v>

106
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.600
It's a little bit like nobody argues that gravity doesn't exist in anatomic

107
00:05:57.601 --> 00:05:59.600
nucleus. It's just not relevant physics there.

108
00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.640
So the physics of information is everywhere.

109
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.040
It exists at every combinatorial scale, but it becomes more and more relevant.

110
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.000
The more set of possibilities that could exist, because you're, you're, you're,

111
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.160
you have to specify more and more about why this thing exists and not the

112
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.400
infinite. It's not an &lt;inaudible&gt;, but you know,

113
00:06:15.401 --> 00:06:17.710
the set of undefined set of other things that could exist.
