1
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.500
<v 0>So what's a colloid engine.</v>

2
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.050
<v 1>So the same rocket people that,</v>

3
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.780
um, came up with, with these ideas for electric propulsion,

4
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.460
um, probably in the middle of last century, uh,

5
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.440
also realize that there's one more place to get charged particles

6
00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:27.620
from. Um, if you're going to be using electric propulsion,

7
00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:30.230
so you can take a gas and you can ionize it,

8
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.790
but there are also some liquids, particularly ionic liquids,

9
00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:39.770
which is what we use that you also can use as a source of ions.

10
00:00:39.771 --> 00:00:42.890
And if you have ions and you put them in a field, you generate a force.

11
00:00:42.891 --> 00:00:46.910
So they recognize that. But, um,

12
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.370
part of being able to leverage that technique is being able to kind of

13
00:00:52.371 --> 00:00:57.080
manipulate those liquids on a scale of nanometers or, or, you know,

14
00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.420
very few microns. So, you know,

15
00:00:59.421 --> 00:01:04.130
the diameter of a human hair or something like that. And in the fifties,

16
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.930
there was no way to do that.

17
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.830
So they wrote about it in some books and then it kind of died for a little bit.

18
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.000
And then with, um, Silicon memes,

19
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:15.500
computer processors, and,

20
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.480
and when Foundry started becoming more ubiquitous and my advisor,

21
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.480
um, started at MIT, uh,

22
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.860
kind of put those ideas back together and was like, Hey, actually,

23
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.210
there's now a way to build this and bring this other technique to life.

24
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.110
Um, and so the way that,

25
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.040
the way that you actually get the ions out of those liquids, um,

26
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.650
is you put the liquid in, uh, in again,

27
00:01:42.651 --> 00:01:47.180
a strong electric field and the electric field stresses the liquid

28
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.500
and you keep increasing the field and eventually the liquid will assume, uh,

29
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.130
I'll go this way, uh, conical shape. Um, it's the,

30
00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.020
it's when the electric field pressure that's pulling on it, exactly balances,

31
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.170
the liquid's own restoring force, which is its surface tension.

32
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.700
So you have this balance and the liquid assumes a cone, um,

33
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.050
when it's perfectly balanced like that. And at the tip of a cone, um,

34
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.670
the radius of curvature goes to zero right at the tip. Um, and,

35
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.240
uh, the radius, sorry, the electric field, um,

36
00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:24.740
right at the tip of a sharp object would go to infinity. Uh,

37
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.870
cause it goes, um, uh,

38
00:02:26.871 --> 00:02:30.110
is one over the radius and one over the radius squared.

39
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.420
And instead of the electric field going to infinity and maybe

40
00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:38.210
like generating a wormhole or something, um,

41
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.100
a jet of ions instead starts issuing from the tip of that

42
00:02:43.101 --> 00:02:43.491
liquid.

43
00:02:43.491 --> 00:02:47.270
So the field becomes strong enough there that you can pull ions out of the

44
00:02:47.271 --> 00:02:47.720
liquid, right?

45
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.830
<v 0>It was the liquid we're talking about. There's a bunch of different ones.</v>

46
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.780
<v 1>I can do it with, um, with different types of liquids. It depends on, you know,</v>

47
00:02:56.781 --> 00:03:00.670
how easily you can free ions from their neighbors.

48
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:05.260
And if it has enough surface tension so that you can build up a high enough

49
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:09.610
electric field. But, um, what we use are called ionic liquids,

50
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.270
and they're really just positive. They're, uh, they're very similar to salts,

51
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.360
but they happen to be liquid over a really wide range of temperatures.

52
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.490
<v 2>This sounds like really cool. Okay. So how big is the, uh,</v>

53
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.420
how big is the corner we talking? Uh, what, what's the size of this corner?

54
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.340
<v 1>Well, if you have a cone that's emitting pure ions. Um, the,</v>

55
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.420
I can't remember if it's the radius or diameter, but, um,

56
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.670
that emission is happening from that. Kona is something like 20 nanometers.

57
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.560
<v 2>Oh, as a magic, something slightly bigger. But so like this is,</v>

58
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.020
so this is tiny, tiny,

59
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.010
hence the only being able to do it recently. Yeah. That's right.

60
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.690
So this is all controlled by computer, I guess like, or like how,

61
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:56.610
how do you control something?

62
00:03:56.611 --> 00:04:01.200
How do you create a cone that generates ions at a scale of nanometers? Exactly.

63
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.880
So.

64
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.740
<v 1>The kind of main trick to making this work is that physically</v>

65
00:04:07.741 --> 00:04:12.330
we manufacture hundreds or thousands of sharp structures and then

66
00:04:12.331 --> 00:04:17.100
supply the liquid to the tips. So that does a few things.

67
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.280
It makes sure that we know where the ion beams are forming,

68
00:04:20.281 --> 00:04:24.300
so we can put holes in the grid above them to let them actually leave instead of

69
00:04:24.301 --> 00:04:26.490
hitting. Right. Cool. Um,

70
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.840
but it also reduces the actual field. We have to, the voltage,

71
00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:34.200
we have to apply to create that field because the field will be much stronger if

72
00:04:34.201 --> 00:04:39.030
we can already give the liquid a tip to form on. Um,

73
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.500
and those tips, we form have radio. We have curvature, um,

74
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.150
on the order of probably like single microns.

75
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.730
So we are working at a little bit larger scale,

76
00:04:50.731 --> 00:04:54.960
but once we create that support and the electric field can be focused at that

77
00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:57.300
tip, then the tiny little cone can form.

78
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.520
<v 2>So there's something there's an already like a hard material that like</v>

79
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.850
gives you the base for the cone and the pouring liquid over it.

80
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.130
<v 1>From the bottom. Yeah. It's poorest.</v>

81
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.850
So we actually supply it from the back of the chip and then.

82
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.010
<v 2>Forms on top on that structure. Yeah.</v>

83
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.250
And then you somehow make it like super sharp, the liquid.

84
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.710
So the ions can live.

85
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.910
<v 1>Then we have applied that field to get those ions in that same field,</v>

86
00:05:26.911 --> 00:05:28.320
then accelerates them.

87
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.870
<v 2>That's awesome. And there's like a bunch of these.</v>

88
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.310
<v 1>Yeah. I should have, I should have brought something. Um, so.</v>

89
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.850
<v 2>You can just pretend that you have some nanometre cones on. Yeah.</v>

90
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.140
<v 1>So actually, you know, kind of about this scale, um, we build,</v>

91
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.610
we call them thruster chips and it's just a convenient form factor and it's a

92
00:05:47.611 --> 00:05:51.030
square centimeter. And on each square centimeter today,

93
00:05:51.031 --> 00:05:53.820
we have about 500 of the actual physical,

94
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.680
we call them emitters those physical cones. Um,

95
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.390
and we're working on increasing that by a factor of four in the coming

96
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:06.050
months in size or in number and the density,

97
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:09.110
the number of emitters within the same square centimeter.

98
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.413
<v 2>So that thing,</v>

99
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.150
cause I think I've seen pictures of you with like a tiny thing in your hand.

100
00:06:13.151 --> 00:06:16.600
That must be the thing. Okay. So that's an engine. Yeah.

101
00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.970
<v 1>Um, so that is kind of the ionization chamber and</v>

102
00:06:21.971 --> 00:06:26.140
thrust producing part of it. What's not shown in that picture,

103
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.870
um, is the propellant tank,

104
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.220
so we can keep supplying more and more of the liquid to those, um,

105
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.060
emission sites.

106
00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.470
And then we also provide a power electronic system that talks to the

107
00:06:38.471 --> 00:06:40.930
spacecraft and turns our device on and off.

108
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.340
<v 2>The core engine. That's the core of the code.</v>

109
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.550
<v 1>Um, it's the way I've been talking about it. It's um,</v>

110
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.300
more of ion electrospray colloid, um,

111
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.490
tends to mean like liquid droplets coming off of the jet,

112
00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.140
but if you make smaller and smaller cones, you get pure ions.

113
00:07:02.141 --> 00:07:03.850
So we're kind of like a subset of Cola.

114
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.700
<v 2>Yes. What, uh, aspects of this,</v>

115
00:07:06.701 --> 00:07:09.970
you said that it's been full of mystery from the physics perspective,

116
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:15.070
what aspects of this are understood and what are still

117
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.300
full of mystery?

118
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:19.600
<v 1>Yeah. Recently, um,</v>

119
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.580
we've been understanding the kind of instabilities and

120
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.150
stable regimes of, um, you know,

121
00:07:28.151 --> 00:07:32.980
how much liquid do you supply and, and what field do you apply and um,

122
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:37.060
why is it flickering on and off or why does it have these weird behaviors?

123
00:07:37.061 --> 00:07:39.220
So that's in the past just couple of years,

124
00:07:39.221 --> 00:07:44.020
that's become much more understood. Um,

125
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.520
I think the two areas that come to mind as far as, um,

126
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:53.470
not as well understood are, um, the boundary between,

127
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.190
you know, you have, um, we,

128
00:07:56.191 --> 00:07:59.830
we actually use kind of big molecular ions.

129
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.880
And if you're looking at the molecular scale,

130
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:06.160
you have, you know,

131
00:08:06.161 --> 00:08:09.280
some ions that you've extracted and they're in this electric field,

132
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.480
one eye on, you know, it's a big molecule,

133
00:08:13.481 --> 00:08:16.540
it's getting energy from the electric field.

134
00:08:16.541 --> 00:08:20.830
And some of that energy is going into the bonds and making it vibrate and doing

135
00:08:20.831 --> 00:08:21.581
weird things to it.

136
00:08:21.581 --> 00:08:26.380
Sometimes it breaks them apart and then zooming out to the

137
00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:27.370
whole beam.

138
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.690
The beam has some behaviors as this beam of ions.

139
00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:36.940
And there's a big gap between what are those? What, how do you connect those?

140
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.990
Um, and how do we understand that better so that we can understand the beam

141
00:08:40.991 --> 00:08:42.820
performance of, of the engine?

142
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.850
<v 2>Is that a theory question or is that an engineering question?</v>

143
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.690
<v 1>Theory?</v>

144
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:51.640
Definitely where Axion is a startup and we're more in the business

145
00:08:51.641 --> 00:08:56.400
of building and testing and observing, um, and characterizing.

146
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.730
Um, and we're not really diving much into that theory right now.
