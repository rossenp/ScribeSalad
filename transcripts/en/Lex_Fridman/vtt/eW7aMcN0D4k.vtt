WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.860
<v 0>Can I ask you about love? Oh, sure.</v>

2
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.920
<v 1>Uh, I'm feeling it, you know, like we're an hour or two here. Lacks. Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.570
You feel you're good. We're good. We're good. We got a bromance going here.

4
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.180
I feel it too. It's Eric Weinstein level, but I feel like it's close.

5
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.170
<v 0>Yeah. I'm feeling the love. But you, we talked about the</v>

6
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.230
music to my ears,

7
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.060
your whole rant on the Olympic nature of a startup.

8
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.750
Is there a role,

9
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.520
like what role does love family friendship play in

10
00:00:40.521 --> 00:00:45.230
that brutal pursuit of excellence that

11
00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:48.710
is building a startup, building a company or building any,

12
00:00:48.711 --> 00:00:50.480
creating anything new in this world?

13
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.030
<v 2>Such a great question. Um, and, and totally unprepared for it, uh,</v>

14
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.610
because I knew nobody would ever ask me about that. So I think it's why you've,

15
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.280
you've, you've got quite a following, uh, uh,

16
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.760
on your podcast is that you're able to ask these questions and, um,

17
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.240
I can tell one story because, uh, you know, I don't talk about,

18
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.220
I try not to talk about relationship with you on that often, because you know,

19
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.290
he's so famous now. I mean, when we met,

20
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.020
I used to go out to parties with him and people like, Oh my God,

21
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.820
you're Jason Cox. I was like, yeah. And like, who's your friend. I'm like,

22
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.470
that's my friend, Eli and he's. And they'd be like,

23
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.230
why did he do doing rocket ships? But he's told this story publicly,

24
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.600
but I can tell it. And it would never talk about having that.

25
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.300
He hasn't already talked about publicly, especially since he saw high-profile,

26
00:01:29.301 --> 00:01:32.970
but it was pretty funny moment. Um, he, there,

27
00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:35.690
there was a moment in time when Tesla almost went out of business and you've

28
00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:37.790
probably heard this story, uh, many times,

29
00:01:37.791 --> 00:01:41.060
but it was during the financial crisis and, uh,

30
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.010
they were running out of money and I said, uh, uh,

31
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.290
you know, let's go get a steak. And we're in LA.

32
00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:53.120
And we drove to boa and I had my orange Tesla Roadster and he had his P one or P

33
00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:56.480
two, like the red one that I think is in space now. Um,

34
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.200
and we drove to the valet and we had a steak together and we're sitting there

35
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.110
and I said, you know, I read the story in Gawker or whatever, you know,

36
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.480
and New York times here, you only got like five weeks of money left in Tesla.

37
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.140
He goes, it's not true. I was like, Oh, thank God. And he goes,

38
00:02:12.141 --> 00:02:12.974
we have two weeks.

39
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:14.810
<v 1>I got caught.</v>

40
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.820
<v 2>I was like, well, what's going on with the rocket ship company? You know, like,</v>

41
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.450
you know, I know you did the one last month and you don't,

42
00:02:23.451 --> 00:02:25.610
you have one coming up and he's like, yeah, we got the third one coming up.

43
00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:28.400
I was like, well, how's that going as well with blow that one up.

44
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.770
But there was no more space X. I was like,

45
00:02:30.771 --> 00:02:33.920
so two weeks of money left in Tesla and space X,

46
00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:36.490
you blew up the first two rockets. You blow up the third space. X's over.

47
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.280
He's like, yeah. I was like, I can loan you a couple million dollars.

48
00:02:40.281 --> 00:02:43.070
I don't have like a ton. Um, he's like, it's okay.

49
00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:47.900
Our friend has loaned me some money and has been super

50
00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:50.210
public about this. I would never tell the story in, listen, he hadn't been in,

51
00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:52.370
but he was talking to me. He never said who it was,

52
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.210
but somebody had loaned him money to keep them afloat. He was,

53
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.440
he was functionally bankrupt. I mean, he had the equity in the companies,

54
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:02.230
but the equity was quickly becoming worth zero and the financial crisis.

55
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:06.340
And he is figuring out if he's going to go on vacation for Christmas or not.

56
00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:10.150
And he's on the phone trying to, you know, um, you know, save the,

57
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.200
save both companies. And I said, certainly there must be some good news.

58
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.730
And he takes that as Blackberry to date this conversation, there are no iPhones,

59
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.780
Taylor's Blackberry. And he starts swiping and he says, don't tell anybody,

60
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.560
this is what I'm building. And he shows me the model S

61
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.340
and nobody knew that it was working on the model.

62
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:32.920
S we knew he was doing the ma the Roadster,

63
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:36.190
and he was trying to save the company. And I looked at it and I was like,

64
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.730
that's gorgeous. Um, it was the clay models.

65
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.560
So it was a full-size clay model.

66
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:44.620
So there's human beings standing around a clay version of this tiny little

67
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:47.700
Blackberry picture I'm scrolling through on the, remember that little, uh,

68
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.600
pad or the ball on flat ground scrolling through it. I'm like, this is great.

69
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.980
And I just said to him, I was like, what's the range going to be? He says, well,

70
00:03:55.981 --> 00:03:59.160
I think we get 250 miles. I was like 250 miles. It's like, yeah,

71
00:03:59.161 --> 00:04:02.370
I think it'd be the safest car ever. I said, what is it going to cost? He says,

72
00:04:02.371 --> 00:04:07.050
I think this could cost eventually 50, $60,000. I said,

73
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.790
Elon, if you make that car, you'll change. The world you have to,

74
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.230
this company must survive because the Roadsters for like

75
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.030
2000 people in United States, this car is for every person, the United States,

76
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.710
every single person that I say it's needs will want this car. If it's $50,000,

77
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.880
maybe some of the people who you have 20 or $30,000, won't be able to afford it,

78
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.990
but the law wanted it's gorgeous. And he said, you really think so? I was like,

79
00:04:33.991 --> 00:04:37.160
yeah. So I got home and I talked to my wife, Jade, and I said,

80
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.060
you have the checkbook. She does all the finances and stuff like that.

81
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.560
Pays the bills and whatever. And I said, um, yeah,

82
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.750
don't tell anybody he wants making this gray car.

83
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.750
And I wrote two checks for $50,000.

84
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.220
And I just took out his paper and I wrote E comma, uh,

85
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.590
love, love the new car. I'll take two. I signed it.

86
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.710
I kissed the two 50,000 checks, put them in the envelope.

87
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.440
And I FedEx it to him for Monday delivery.

88
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.780
And I said to Jade that a hundred thousand dollars is going to be gone in

89
00:05:09.781 --> 00:05:12.540
48 hours because it will pay for one or two days of payroll on Tesla.

90
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.830
So we just added like, instead of two weeks in a row, he's got 12 days. Yeah.

91
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.100
And, uh, the checks don't care.

92
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.770
But then I read a story that he's closed the money.

93
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.810
He saved the company and like the next week or two,

94
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.420
and a couple of months later, uh, the checks get cashed and I'm like,

95
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.060
okay, three years later, I get an email.

96
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.930
Your reservation number from Tesla. Yeah.

97
00:05:35.931 --> 00:05:39.840
Your reservation number is zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one.

98
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.210
And then five seconds later, your reservation number is zero zero zero, zero 73.

99
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.110
And I forward the number one Yolanda. I said, uh, you know,

100
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.060
I can't take number one, signature, number one, I can't take that. That's yours.

101
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.920
And he's like, well, I got five of them.

102
00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.950
And besides you're the first person that ordered it.

103
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.470
And I was the first person who had seen it.

104
00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.280
I know it was a very peaceful moment.

105
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.700
It was an incredible moment for both of us. And we talk about it sometimes, uh,

106
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.320
you know, those moments in time. And when you,

107
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.990
to your point about love and Nila darkest moment,

108
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.710
but one of the darkest moments in his life, probably that I can tell you,

109
00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:17.900
it was the darkest period of his life, for sure. Um,

110
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.680
and he's been very public about how dark that was. And I think, you know,

111
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.710
this is why I have great sympathy for the entrepreneurs of the world,

112
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:26.330
like the suffering and the pain.

113
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.270
And when he talks about the suffering and the pain that all of these founders

114
00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:29.691
have felt,

115
00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:32.690
and then we were throwing rocks at them and we're criticizing them as they try

116
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:35.660
to change the world and save humanity. And in Tesla's case, I mean,

117
00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:39.590
they weren't, you know, they, they weren't like delivering pizza. I mean,

118
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.200
they were trying to get us off of fossil fuels.

119
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:46.340
Like this was a big heady mission to literally save the environment,

120
00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:50.390
the planet humanity, and the way they shorted that stock. And they attacked him.

121
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.640
It was always perplexing to me.

122
00:06:52.641 --> 00:06:57.590
Why any human being who is standing on God's green

123
00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.180
earth would want to throw rocks at the guy who is trying to

124
00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:06.800
STEM the dam of global warming Medis about to engulf all of us,

125
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.130
how dare they throw rocks at that guy?

126
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.680
There's so many people you throw rocks at.

127
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.510
There's somebody who's making the Juul vaporizer throw rocks at that scumbag,

128
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.470
no offense, but like whoever's making the Juul things and, you know,

129
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.820
selling pina colada flavor to 12 year olds like throw rocks at them.

130
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.400
Somebody is doing something, you know, at porridge, but not E I mean, and, uh,

131
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.910
yeah, anyway, that, that car is, you know,

132
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:39.830
up the road here sitting under a cover with 20,000 miles on it in my garage.

133
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.190
And then the roads there, number 16 is in the garage next to it.

134
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.760
And every day I walked by the two of them and I got a warm feeling in my heart.

135
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.960
Cause I know he did it against all odds against all odds.

136
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:56.480
He pulled it off. Uh, and it was that moment,

137
00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.340
that month in that too, that it was Jan. It was probably December, January,

138
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.770
December of 2008. I think it was just 12 years ago.

139
00:08:03.771 --> 00:08:06.410
When you think about 13 years ago, it was dark. I mean,

140
00:08:06.411 --> 00:08:09.740
it was dark and they almost had the same thing happen. Uh, you know,

141
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.710
when the model three production in June of two years, three years ago.

142
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:16.880
And I remember him just trying to get the model three out the door and the

143
00:08:16.881 --> 00:08:18.020
company almost crashed then.
