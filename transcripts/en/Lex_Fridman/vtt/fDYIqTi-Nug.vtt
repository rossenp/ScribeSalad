1
00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:07.510
<v 0>You've talked to Eric, then, uh, he has a sense that growth,</v>

2
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.510
uh, you know, like the, the,

3
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.110
the entirety of the American system is based on the assumption that we're gonna

4
00:00:14.111 --> 00:00:17.790
grow forever. The, the economy's gonna grow forever. Do you think, uh,

5
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.910
uh, economic growth will continue indefinitely or will we stagnate?

6
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.060
<v 1>I've long been in agreement with Eric, Peter teal, uh,</v>

7
00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:31.180
Robert Gordon and others that growth has slowed down.

8
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.060
I argued that in my book, the great stagnation, uh, appropriately titled,

9
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.980
but the last two years I've become much more optimistic.

10
00:00:38.981 --> 00:00:42.940
I've seen a lot of breakthroughs in green energy and battery technology.

11
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.330
RNA vaccines in medicine is a big deal already.

12
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.810
It will repair our GDP and save millions of lives around the world.

13
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.610
Uh, there's an anti malaria vaccine. That's now in stage three trial.

14
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.130
It probably works CRISPR to defeat sickle cell anemia,

15
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.280
just space area after area, after area,

16
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.320
there's suddenly the surge of breakthroughs.

17
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.920
I would say many of them rooted in superior computation and ultimately Moore's

18
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.720
law and access to those computational abilities.

19
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.360
So I'm much more optimistic than say the last time I spoke to Eric &lt;laugh&gt;,

20
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.520
I don't know. He, he moves all the time in his views.

21
00:01:20.521 --> 00:01:21.680
I don't know where he's at now.

22
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.360
<v 0>He's not at, he hasn't gained. That's really interesting.</v>

23
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.030
So your little drop of optimism comes from like,

24
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.231
uh,

25
00:01:30.231 --> 00:01:34.470
there might be a fundamental shift in the kind of things that computation has

26
00:01:34.471 --> 00:01:36.870
unlocked for us in terms of like,

27
00:01:36.871 --> 00:01:39.670
it could be a wellspring of innovation that can, that, uh, uh,

28
00:01:39.671 --> 00:01:41.230
enables growth for a long time to come.

29
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.780
Like Eric has not quite could connected to the

30
00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:50.500
computation aspect yet to where it could be a wellspring of innovation, but.

31
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.220
<v 1>You're very close to it in your own work. Yes.</v>

32
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.420
I don't have to tell you that the work you're doing would not have been possible

33
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.140
not very long ago.

34
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.140
<v 0>But the question is how much does that work enable continue growth for decades</v>

35
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.073
to come.

36
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.140
<v 1>That's for all their problems.</v>

37
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.930
Some version of driverless vehicle will be a thing. I'm not sure when you know,

38
00:02:07.931 --> 00:02:12.250
much better than I do, maybe only partially, but that too will be a big deal.

39
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.850
<v 0>Well, one of the open questions that sort of the Peter TEALS school, uh,</v>

40
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.690
area of ideas is how much can be converted to technology.

41
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.520
How much, how many parts of our lives can technology integrate in, in innovate?

42
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.400
Like, can, can it replace, uh, healthcare can, you know, can,

43
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.360
can it replace the legal system? Can it replace government, not replace,

44
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.520
but like, you know, uh,

45
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.040
make it digital and thereby enable computation to improve

46
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.280
it. Right? That's the open question,

47
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.110
because many aspects of our live are still not really that, uh,

48
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.750
dig digitized.

49
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.670
<v 1>There was a New York times symposium in April, which is not long ago.</v>

50
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.230
And they asked the so called experts. When are we gonna get vaccines?

51
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.000
And the most optimistic answer was in four years. Yeah.

52
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.480
And obviously we beat that by a long mile.

53
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.160
So I think people still haven't woken up.

54
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:12.760
You mentioned my tiny drop of optimism, but it's a big drop of optimism.

55
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.120
&lt;laugh&gt; is it, is it.

56
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.920
<v 0>A waterfall yet? I mean, is it, is it just.</v>

57
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.270
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; well, here's my pessimism ever. There are major new technologies.</v>

58
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.750
They also tend to be used for violence directly or indirectly radio Hitler.

59
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.070
Not that he hit people over the head with radios,

60
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.590
but it enabled their eyes of various dictators.

61
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.030
So the new technologies now, whatever exactly they may be,

62
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.430
they're gonna cause a lot of trouble. Yeah. And that's my pessimism.

63
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.900
Not that I think they're all gonna a slow to a trickle. When.

64
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.900
<v 0>Was the stagnation book?</v>

65
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.500
<v 1>Two, 2011, 2011. Yes. It was the first of the stagnation books.</v>

66
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.433
In fact, &lt;laugh&gt;.

67
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.173
<v 0>It's, it's very interesting.</v>

68
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.700
<v 1>Uh, but even then I said, this is temporary and I was predicting,</v>

69
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:58.180
it would be gone in about 20 years time. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, uh,

70
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.450
I'm not sure that's exactly be the right prediction, like 2030,

71
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.650
but I think we're actually gonna beat that.

72
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.891
<v 0>So you think, uh,</v>

73
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:09.210
United States might still be on top of the world for the rest of the century in

74
00:04:09.211 --> 00:04:13.210
terms of its economic, uh, economic growth impact on the world,

75
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.210
scientific innovation, all those kinds of things.

76
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.930
<v 1>That's too long to predict, but I'm bullish on America in general.</v>
