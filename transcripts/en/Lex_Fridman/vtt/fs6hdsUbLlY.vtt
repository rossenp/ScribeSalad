1
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:03.440
<v 0>This is.</v>

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.280
<v 1>Is a complicated subject, but I, myself was so, uh,</v>

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.840
I decided to journey out from the world of being a researcher at

4
00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:15.440
MIT and potentially doing a startup myself.

5
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.620
And I've been thinking of, you know,

6
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.700
I wanted to come to Silicon Valley to do so. It's the land of the entrepreneur.

7
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.710
And there's a lot of my friends,

8
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.970
a lot of them are successfully have been entrepreneurs themselves has said,

9
00:00:28.971 --> 00:00:33.770
do not come to Silicon Valley. Uh, it'd be you've. You've started you,

10
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.540
you ran amazing teams of engineers. You started a lot of successful businesses.

11
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.580
I wondered if you could comment on why a lot of people are leaving

12
00:00:43.581 --> 00:00:46.790
California. Is there something that could be fixed about California?

13
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.310
If you were starting a business today,

14
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.440
would you consider somewhere else like Austin or some other place,

15
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.090
or is Silicon Valley still?

16
00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.100
Is it just a little lull everybody's being overdramatic during this particular

17
00:01:01.101 --> 00:01:02.630
year of the coronavirus and so on?

18
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.230
<v 0>I think, you know, even Austin is getting overheated. I hear, um,</v>

19
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.490
and I've had relatives and friends moved to Texas within the last few months.

20
00:01:10.491 --> 00:01:14.390
So, uh, Texas as a whole is a big place. And, uh, you know,

21
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.870
people are moving to Florida. There's a big movement toward Miami. Um,

22
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.040
Peter teal, Keith affordable, all these people. Um, the mayor has been very, uh,

23
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.250
business friendly about it, which I think is just good politics. Um,

24
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.860
the America is fundamentally commercial Republic.

25
00:01:27.861 --> 00:01:30.170
So you would think this would be what's happening for a long time.

26
00:01:30.171 --> 00:01:33.860
California was the golden state. I came here in late 76 when I was a teenager.

27
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.540
Um, it's in crushing debt to do the lockdowns.

28
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.690
It's got the highest taxes that's gonna matter.

29
00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:45.890
People will do flee tat high taxes. Um, it's got, uh,

30
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.560
likely fires every year because of the dead fall.

31
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.770
It's not global warming it's because the forests weren't managed like they had

32
00:01:51.771 --> 00:01:55.700
been in the first part of the 20th century. Um, just,

33
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.690
I would say corruption at all levels, especially up to the governor who,

34
00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.970
you know,

35
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.500
famously was eating at the French laundry in a claim that the outside it wasn't

36
00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:08.270
inside and they were out masks off and it was great. Uh, do what I say,

37
00:02:08.271 --> 00:02:11.780
not what I do, uh, rules for the, but not for me.

38
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.490
When you see that in leadership people either run or they,

39
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.590
they get rid of the leadership. So there's a recall drive,

40
00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:22.610
which is about to reach the threshold or in the old days they get their guns,

41
00:02:22.611 --> 00:02:25.820
right? Yeah. You don't put up with this junk, but ultimately.

42
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.760
<v 1>The, the thing that made Silicon Valley a special place,</v>

43
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.690
it gave freedom to like young kids, entrepreneurs,

44
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.730
young minds, brave minds to, to think bold, to try different stuff.

45
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.690
I mean, even if the taxes are high, so outside of financial stuff,

46
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.250
outside of all of that housing, super expensive housing. So it's hard. Okay.

47
00:02:46.251 --> 00:02:47.390
Everything about startups.

48
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.330
<v 0>Euro and the, and they didn't plan the roads, right? Yeah.</v>

49
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.710
They got rid of public transportation in LA, like the who framed Roger rabbit,

50
00:02:54.711 --> 00:02:59.380
cartoon show these trolley cars and Portland to the oil companies in the

51
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.470
DOD conspired to build highways and make cars dominant.

52
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.130
And the rights of way are long gone. Like Elan's going to go underground.

53
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.150
I wished him, well, it's probably the only way to do it now, but.

54
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.910
<v 1>There's still a place.</v>

55
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.880
Do you think it's possible that Silicon Valley is still a place where magic

56
00:03:14.881 --> 00:03:17.640
happens, where the next Google's built, where the next, I mean,

57
00:03:17.641 --> 00:03:20.690
brave is built where, uh.

58
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.050
<v 0>All good things come to an end.</v>

59
00:03:22.051 --> 00:03:25.350
I think the problem is Silicon Valley had strong network effects through

60
00:03:25.351 --> 00:03:29.400
Stanford, through the angel investor networks and the wealth effect.

61
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.370
And originally you have to give the federal government credit.

62
00:03:32.371 --> 00:03:35.250
Like the ARPANET was a government project. That's not kid ourselves,

63
00:03:35.251 --> 00:03:38.340
this wasn't wild free market, you know, libertarian capitalism.

64
00:03:38.341 --> 00:03:43.260
This was all cold war stuff. Um, you had, uh, out of the academia,

65
00:03:43.261 --> 00:03:47.160
you had Shockley. And then the, the, the trader is aid in Fairchild and Intel.

66
00:03:47.161 --> 00:03:49.800
And, but now, you know,

67
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.800
once the last fab that was built in the Valley micro unit,

68
00:03:52.801 --> 00:03:54.750
you might've been the last time. I don't know, I haven't followed it.

69
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.600
We built a fab in Sunnyvale and, uh,

70
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.610
and micro unity in starting early nineties. And now the fabs are overseas.

71
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.750
Um,

72
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.070
and the one thing that I will say that the oligarchs have intentionally done in

73
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.320
both parties is sort of labor and environmental protection law arbitrage

74
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.260
by going where the labor is cheaper and the environmental laws aren't as strict.

75
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.140
And, you know, that's polluted the hell out of parts of China,

76
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.060
but it's made things you can make cheaper junk. And, uh, this, this is not,

77
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.900
uh, this is not a story that's over yet. So what is Silicon Valley for now?

78
00:04:27.901 --> 00:04:31.410
It's for the network effect, the, the, the brain trust of who, you know,

79
00:04:31.411 --> 00:04:34.350
the parties, the Stanford's, um,

80
00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.030
sort of network that's fragile too, over time. I'm afraid, right?

81
00:04:39.031 --> 00:04:43.170
Stanford. Uh, a lot of good professors are like, uh,

82
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.560
they still filter, you know, mainly based on socioeconomic status,

83
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.300
but it's kind of a skate school.

84
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.310
I had a friend hired out of Harvard 20 years ago at Netscape,

85
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.280
and we talked about Harvard and he said, yeah,

86
00:04:56.281 --> 00:04:58.560
there's still professors are great on the curve. And I said, Oh yeah,

87
00:04:58.561 --> 00:05:01.680
I don't think there are any doing that at Stanford. He said, yo,

88
00:05:01.681 --> 00:05:04.530
it was shocking. Some of the students got seasoned these and they were crying.

89
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.980
I was like, yes, that's right. The precious dears can't take that at Stanford.

90
00:05:07.981 --> 00:05:12.210
So they get A's and B's now you look at China and people say,

91
00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:16.170
what you all about China? They true Russia too, that a lot of math,

92
00:05:16.171 --> 00:05:17.790
science training, a lot of engineering,

93
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.410
a lot of people who are doing their coursework to get the A's and B's

94
00:05:22.411 --> 00:05:26.550
so, um, I'm an American I'm born in the 4th of July,

95
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.600
4th of July, July. Wow. And in America, as I say,

96
00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:33.540
fundamentally as a commercial Republic, you can try to make it something else.

97
00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:36.540
You can see it's the new Atlantis and mystify it. You could,

98
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.460
you could talk about it in a more, I think correct way,

99
00:05:38.461 --> 00:05:39.990
which is 13 colonies that grew,

100
00:05:39.991 --> 00:05:43.920
and then there's a lot of local or written original design. Anyway,

101
00:05:43.921 --> 00:05:47.400
the federal Federalist papers talk about this. There's a lot of subsidiarity,

102
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.320
but that's, that's been eroded over time. And like I say,

103
00:05:52.321 --> 00:05:53.820
a lot of the offshoring has hurt.

104
00:05:53.821 --> 00:05:57.140
So what happened with coronavirus people working from home?

105
00:05:57.141 --> 00:05:58.100
And at first it was funny.

106
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.580
Cause I have friends at Google who used to grumble that not only did they have

107
00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:02.510
to come into the office,

108
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.090
if they joined a different team that was centered at a different office,

109
00:06:05.091 --> 00:06:07.250
they had to move. Or, you know, if, if,

110
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.250
if the VA team was reconstituted in Munich,

111
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:14.540
which it was after Lara's booked got tired of JavaScript that they hired in

112
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:18.590
Munich, or they hired PhDs in Germany and moved to Munich, um, with coronavirus,

113
00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:20.300
everyone's working from home and it's like, well, I really,

114
00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:23.540
if I can work for Google from home, but then the next shoe dropped,

115
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.220
then people started asking Mark soccer bird, Hey,

116
00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:29.450
can I move to my hometown in the Midwest? Yeah. And he said, okay.

117
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.780
And they said, Oh, can I keep getting myself in Valley pay? No,

118
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.750
we're going to figure out why your cost of living there. Isn't,

119
00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:36.860
we're going to adjust your pay. Of course.

120
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.440
<v 1>And these colonies in these little mini experiments that all combined to the big</v>

121
00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:46.180
giant experiment, I have a, I don't know I have this, uh,

122
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.330
vision of America, which the countries I was born in Russia, like I said here,

123
00:06:49.331 --> 00:06:53.650
and this is a truly wonderful country. I, um, I wasn't born on the 4th of July.

124
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:55.780
My sloppy people still fly. I still,

125
00:06:55.781 --> 00:06:58.930
and I'm a red blooded American at this point.

126
00:06:58.931 --> 00:07:02.980
And I have a sense that we figured it out somehow, if so,

127
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.210
come Valley burns and other places will come up in this place that we even more

128
00:07:07.211 --> 00:07:08.830
innovation and people will move.

129
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:14.080
And the remote work might change fundamentally how we work or might

130
00:07:14.081 --> 00:07:18.250
not. It might just give you the freedom to then create many other small Silicon

131
00:07:18.251 --> 00:07:21.790
valleys throughout the place that Austin included, but other places as well.

132
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.420
And we somehow figure it, figure it out. And, uh.

133
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.660
<v 0>I think that's,</v>

134
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.340
that's true that there will be more mobility and maybe new places that come up.

135
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:35.500
I don't know if Silicon Valley has, you know, passed some sell by date because,

136
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.070
um, it did hurt the coronavirus hurt,

137
00:07:39.071 --> 00:07:42.460
the lockdowns hurt and the FA in the sense that part of what keeps things going

138
00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:44.230
is social. And so a lot of young people,

139
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.570
even before coronavirus moved to San Francisco,

140
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.080
it was very strange to watch because in the eighties we all lived in the Valley

141
00:07:50.081 --> 00:07:53.170
and it was less populated in San Francisco was grungy,

142
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:57.580
or it was more like dirty Harry in the seventies. But, but by the nineties, uh,

143
00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.590
and Jamie runs a nightclub there, and he's talked about this,

144
00:07:59.591 --> 00:08:03.070
you had sort of wealthy tech people moving in South of market,

145
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.650
fancy townhouses being built. And, uh,

146
00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:09.160
that's continued in such a point that it's almost like what's the movie by the

147
00:08:09.161 --> 00:08:12.850
South African director, Nels, Jodie foster up in the space colony. Uh,

148
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.240
Matt Damon is the guy in the earth who has to go up. And anyway,

149
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.850
it's about the stratification. It's about the great inequality.

150
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:22.960
The people in the space station have like amazing medical auto docs that can

151
00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:24.820
extend their life or save them, cure cancer.

152
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:29.290
People on the earth are all suffering ground down in poverty. Um,

153
00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.400
and, uh, you know, that sort of happened while I was here.

154
00:08:33.401 --> 00:08:38.380
You saw a lot of money drive prices up along the narrow

155
00:08:38.381 --> 00:08:40.360
peninsula and the single people wanted nightlife.

156
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.260
So they were in the city and the condos in the city got super expensive. And,

157
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.980
you know, even Google friends who are, you know, socially responsible say,

158
00:08:47.981 --> 00:08:51.490
we should have more housing built. We should have yes. In my backyard, not,

159
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.620
not in my backyard, but that's not happening. Uh, as far I can tell,

160
00:08:55.621 --> 00:09:00.390
and from the government to the incumbent landowners and renters,

161
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.820
it's just not happening. And that has to drive people away. I,

162
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.430
I appreciate that when people come here and you should wait for the prices to

163
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.650
monitor, they will. But, um,

164
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.440
but a lot of people are going to go where the prices are lower.
