00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.880
<v 0>Do you think it's possible?</v>

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.840
You said you're not saying it's necessarily a good idea to launch a social

3
00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:11.880
network. Do you think it's possible today?

4
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.720
Maybe you can put yourself in those shoes to launch a social network

5
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.400
that achieves the scale of a Facebook or a Twitter or an Instagram

6
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.670
and maybe even greater scale. Absolutely. How do you do it?

7
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.910
&lt;laugh&gt; asking for a friend.

8
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.670
<v 1>Yeah. If I knew I I'd probably be doing it right now and not sitting here. So.</v>

9
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.110
<v 0>So I mean, there's a lot of ways to ask this question.</v>

10
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.550
One is create a totally new product market fit, create a new market,

11
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.550
create something like Instagram,

12
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.980
which is like create something kind of new or literally out compete

13
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.460
Facebook at its own thing or out compete Twitter at its own thing.

14
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.980
<v 1>The only way to compete. Now, if you wanna build a,</v>

15
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.060
a large social network is to look for the cracks, look for the openings. Um,

16
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.970
you know, no one competed, I mean,

17
00:01:04.971 --> 00:01:06.930
no one competed with the core business of Google,

18
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.650
no one competed with the core business of Microsoft.

19
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.530
You don't go at the big guys doing exactly what they're doing.

20
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.770
Instagram didn't win because it tried to be a visual

21
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.440
Twitter.

22
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.320
Like we spotted things that either Twitter wasn't going to do or refuse

23
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.840
to do images and feed for the longest time, right.

24
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.680
Or that Facebook wasn't doing or not paying attention to because they were

25
00:01:32.681 --> 00:01:36.840
mostly desktop at the time. And we were purely mobile, purely visual.

26
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.920
Often there are opportunities sitting there. You just have to, you have to,

27
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.430
you have to figure out like, uh, I think like there's a strategy book.

28
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.350
I can't remember the name,

29
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.670
but talk about moats and just like the best place to play

30
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.390
is where your competitor,

31
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.790
like literally can't pivot because structurally they're set up not to be there

32
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.790
and that's where you win. Um, and what's fascinating is like,

33
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.260
do you know how many people are like, image is Facebook?

34
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.780
Does that Twitter does that? I mean, how wrong were they really wrong?

35
00:02:10.781 --> 00:02:13.220
And these are some of the smartest people in Silicon valley. Right.

36
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.540
But now Instagram exists for a while. How is it that Snapchat could then exist?

37
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.940
Makes no sense. Like plenty of people would say, well, there's Facebook,

38
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.890
no images. Okay. Okay. Instagram, I'll give you that one, but wait.

39
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.690
Now another image based social networks gonna get really big and then TikTok

40
00:02:31.691 --> 00:02:36.570
comes along like the prior. So you asked me, is it possible?

41
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.210
The only answer reason I'm answering yes.

42
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.570
Is because my prior is that it's happened once every, I don't know,

43
00:02:43.571 --> 00:02:46.370
3, 4, 5 years consistently.

44
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.080
And I can't imagine there's anything structurally that would change that. Um,

45
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.200
so that's why I answer that way. Not because I know how I just,

46
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.640
when you see a pattern,

47
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.400
you see a pattern and there's no reason to believe that's gonna stop. And.

48
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.880
<v 0>It's subtle too, because like you said, uh, Snapchat and TikTok,</v>

49
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.760
they're all doing the same space of things,

50
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.120
but there's something fundamentally different about like a three second video

51
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.960
and a five second video and a 15 second video and a one minute video and a one

52
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.720
hour video, right? Like fundamentally.

53
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.950
<v 1>Different, fundamentally different. I mean,</v>

54
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.750
I think one of the reasons Snapchat exists is because Instagram was so focused

55
00:03:23.751 --> 00:03:25.150
on posting great,

56
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.830
beautiful manicured versions of yourself throughout time.

57
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.070
And there was this enormous demand of like, Hey, I really like this behavior.

58
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.870
I love using Instagram, but man,

59
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.740
I just like wish I could share some thing going on in my day. &lt;laugh&gt; like,

60
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.580
do I really have to put it on my profile?

61
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.980
Do I really have to make it last forever? Do I really? Um,

62
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.020
and that opened up a door, it created a market. Right.

63
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.500
And then what's fascinating is Instagram had an Explorer page for the longest

64
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.820
time and it was image driven. Right. Um,

65
00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.420
but there's absolutely a behavior where you,

66
00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.410
you open up Instagram and you sit on the Explorer page all day that is

67
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:05.690
effectively TikTok, but obviously focused on videos.

68
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.450
And it's not like you could just put the explore page in TikTok form and it

69
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:12.450
works. It had to be video. It had to have music.

70
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.810
These are the hard parts about product development that are very hard to

71
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:19.970
predict. But, um, they're all,

72
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.320
all versions of the same thing with varying.

73
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.520
If you line them up in a bunch of dimensions, they're just like, kind of on

74
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.160
they're different values of the same dimensions, which is like,

75
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.240
I guess easy to say in retrospect.

76
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.000
But like if I were an entrepreneur going after that area, I'd ask myself like,

77
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:41.750
where's the opening? What needs to exist? Because TikTok in exist now you.
