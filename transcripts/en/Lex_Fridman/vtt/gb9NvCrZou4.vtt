00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.370
<v 0>What did you think about the Jake Paul versus Tyron Woodley fight?</v>

2
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.890
<v 1>Uh, well, I thought, I mean, I'm obviously I'm biased. I thought Tyron won. Um,</v>

3
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.170
I had five rounds of three. And again, this,

4
00:00:15.171 --> 00:00:17.050
maybe this is my bias in the way I was seeing it.

5
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.770
I thought he was more effective with the striking and he was more aggressive.

6
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.680
No, Jake had more volume. Um, but that was the only like thing I would give him.

7
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.240
And I guess a lot of people just didn't see it that way.

8
00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:29.200
They thought he landed more significantly more punches.

9
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.240
I just didn't think anyone really did any damage.

10
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.040
<v 0>It was a split decision.</v>

11
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.600
<v 1>Split decision. Yeah. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; were you.</v>

12
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.433
<v 0>Surprised?</v>

13
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.480
<v 1>Um, well, it was the thing. So the thing I said, when I went in to fight him,</v>

14
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.430
he said, we don't really, maybe he's good. Maybe is not. We have no,

15
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.350
we really have no idea to this point. You know?

16
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.030
And so I knew Tyron was a lot better boxing than I was. And so I thought,

17
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.670
okay, Tyron's, there's,

18
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.990
I think there's a good likelihood that Tyron beats him up. Um,

19
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.270
but there's the chance that Jake's kind of good at this.

20
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.790
And I think that's kind of what played out is he's kind of good at it.

21
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:03.990
Even if you saw it the way I saw,

22
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.340
he still was impressive in his showing and he's obviously put a lot of time into

23
00:01:08.341 --> 00:01:11.780
it. So he is, he's not bad. &lt;laugh&gt;, we'll say that much.

24
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.500
<v 0>You know, but isn't this surprising to you that like a elite level athlete,</v>

25
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.740
combat athlete, mm-hmm,

26
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.100
&lt;affirmative&gt; lost to somebody who just takes it really seriously,

27
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.100
but is nevertheless not elite level.

28
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.450
<v 1>Um Hmm. But, but I think boxing is a really specific rule set. Uh,</v>

29
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.290
so we'll speak about Tyra. Not myself. Ty had had good striking, but the,

30
00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:38.250
obviously it was his first boxing match ever. Um, and within mixed martial arts,

31
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.250
you have the,

32
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.730
the fear of the take down and the fear of the kick and fear of other things to

33
00:01:42.731 --> 00:01:44.010
go along with the punching.

34
00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:47.080
And so if you look at Ty and throughout his lot of times,

35
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.240
what set up his punches were like level change fakes at a takedown,

36
00:01:52.241 --> 00:01:54.720
they dropped boom. And then something comes over the top. Right?

37
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.120
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so there's many more elements to worry about in mixed

38
00:01:57.121 --> 00:02:01.440
martial arts, whereas boxing there's only one. It was his first fight. Yes.

39
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.720
I thought heroin was gonna win. I thought this was gonna happen.

40
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.470
But like I said, I mean, it's pretty evident that Jake, he's not bad at boxing.

41
00:02:08.471 --> 00:02:11.390
He's pretty solid. You know, he gets in there and works hard at it. I guess.

42
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.150
<v 0>Out of 10 times, how many times do you think Jake wins against her? Against Ty?</v>

43
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.150
Hmm. They fight again and again and again, like iterative.

44
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.510
<v 1>Yeah. So I mean, I, I, part of the thing is, okay,</v>

45
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.700
so Jake's corner said you need knockout going into the round. Right.

46
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.500
So I think they thought maybe they're trying to motivate him, but I,

47
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.660
I don't see it that way. Cuz if they,

48
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.660
if they were actually thought that he was winning,

49
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.100
why would they encourage him to take a dumb risk when Tyron has clearly has

50
00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:40.820
knockout power, right. It's really stupid coaching philosophy.

51
00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:43.180
If that's what you're thinking. So you obviously are thinking, Hey,

52
00:02:43.181 --> 00:02:46.100
this is actually in the balance. It's competitive. Um,

53
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.570
and I feel like Tyran thought maybe he was winning and didn't have the urgency

54
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.730
necessary. And so I think he, he, there's a chance. He turns it up a lot.

55
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.720
Hmm, man. I would wanna watch him again before I, I, I, okay.

56
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.360
I have problem with my personality. Here's my personality, Alex. Um,

57
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.440
I have an issue with not being able to give really exact answers.

58
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.360
So I hate giving you an answer that like,

59
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.280
I don't feel like is a hundred percent calculated. Yeah. So, um,

60
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.520
I would like to see them go once more. Cause I would like to see, Hey Canty, if,

61
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.280
cause if Ty can turn the pace and, and Jake can't handle it.

62
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.510
And I think it's an eight one or nine two. Right. Um,

63
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.150
if it goes the exact same way and maybe Ty's a close, split decision,

64
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.350
I'm saying, oh, well it's probably gonna be close to every single time.

65
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.230
We're probably gonna get a five to five type of thing. You know? So it's like,

66
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.190
I feel like out of one match, it's not totally indicative of what the future is.

67
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.670
<v 0>Gonna look like.</v>

68
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.220
I feel like Ty would get a knockout and then you would still be in the same

69
00:03:40.221 --> 00:03:44.540
place. Like not, not knowing, not knowing what to predict. Yeah.
