1
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.340
<v 0>Maybe from your perspective,</v>

2
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.930
because you run such an

3
00:00:08.931 --> 00:00:11.720
organization and a Vlad,

4
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.500
the CEO of Robin hood sort of had to make decisions really quickly,

5
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.700
probably had to wake up in the middle of the night kind of thing. Uh, you know,

6
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.450
and he also had a conversation with Elon Musk on, uh, clubhouse,

7
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.330
which I just signed up for. It was, it was a fascinating,

8
00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:30.260
one of the great journalistic, uh, performances of our time.

9
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.660
<v 1>The most surprise for you, Larry is would it be, if he gets an</v>

10
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.650
a and then his Wikipedia.

11
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.960
<v 0>It'd be like journalist and a.</v>

12
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.610
<v 1>Part-time entrepreneurs, this magnets business, as you know,</v>

13
00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:48.350
I don't know if you can comment on.

14
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.350
<v 0>Any aspects of that, but like, if you were a Vlad,</v>

15
00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:52.850
how would you do things differently?

16
00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:56.060
What are your thoughts about his interaction with Elan,

17
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.700
how he should have played it differently? Like,

18
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.680
I guess there's a lot of aspects of this interaction. One is about transparency.

19
00:01:03.681 --> 00:01:04.400
Like how,

20
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.450
how much do you want to tell people about really what went down there's NDAs

21
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.340
potentially involved, uh, how much on,

22
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.210
in private do you want to push back and say, no,

23
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.960
you to centralize power, whatever the phone calls you're getting,

24
00:01:20.961 --> 00:01:24.320
which I'm sure he was getting some kind of phone calls that might not be

25
00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:28.550
contractual. Like it's not contracts that are forcing him, but he was being,

26
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.710
uh, what do you call it?

27
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.580
Like pressured to behave in certain kinds of ways from all kinds of directions?

28
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.630
Like what, uh, what do you take from, uh, this whole situation?

29
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.860
<v 1>I was very excited to see flood response. I mean,</v>

30
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.270
it's pretty cool to have him talk to Elan. Right.

31
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.730
And one of the things that like struck me in the first,

32
00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:50.390
like few seconds I've led speaking was like, I was like,

33
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.730
is Vlad like a boomer? Like, like,

34
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.890
like he seemed like a 55 year old man talking to a 20 year old

35
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.000
Ilan was like the 20 year old. And he's like the 55 year old man.

36
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.530
You can see why Citadel are NMR buddies. Right? Like you can,

37
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.980
you can see why it's like, this is a, this is a nice, it's not a bad thing.

38
00:02:12.981 --> 00:02:17.720
It's like, he's, it's like, he's got a good respectable professional attitude.

39
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.420
Boy.

40
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.580
<v 0>He also tried to do like a jokey thing. Like, no,</v>

41
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.960
we're not being ageist here, boomer. Uh, but like, like a,

42
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.190
like a 60 year old CEO of bank of America would try to make a joke for the kids.

43
00:02:31.191 --> 00:02:31.970
That's what [inaudible].

44
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.380
<v 1>Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. I was like, what is this? This guy's like, what is he 30?</v>

45
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.790
Uh, and I'm like, this is weird. Yeah. Um,

46
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.470
but I think maybe that's also what I like about Elan's kind of influence on

47
00:02:45.471 --> 00:02:49.820
American business is like, he's super like anti they're professional, right?

48
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.090
Like why, why say, why say, you know,

49
00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:55.880
a hundred words about nothing. Right.

50
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.310
And so I liked how he was cutting in and saying flat,

51
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.010
what do you mean the beans, bro?

52
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.260
<v 0>Yeah. So you, you don't have to be courteous.</v>

53
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.710
It's like the first principles thinking it's like, what the hell happened?

54
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.600
And let's just talk like normal people. The problem of course is,

55
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.060
uh, you know, for Ilan, uh, it's cost them. What is it?

56
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:20.590
Tens of millions of dollars is tweeting like that. But perhaps it's a war,

57
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:25.390
the price to pay because ultimately there's something magical about

58
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.760
just being real and honest and just going off the cuff and making the

59
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:35.080
mistakes and paying for them, but just being real and then moments like this,

60
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.850
that was an opportunity for Vlad to be that. And he felt like he wasn't. Um,

61
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.110
do you think there,

62
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.370
do you think we'll ever find out what really went down?

63
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:47.800
If there was something shady underneath it all?

64
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.530
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, it would be sad if nothing shady happened. Right.</v>

65
00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:54.600
But his presence made it shade.

66
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.780
<v 0>Sometimes I feel like that would Mark Zuckerberg,</v>

67
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.800
the CEO of Facebook. Sometimes I feel like, yeah,

68
00:04:01.801 --> 00:04:04.410
there's a lot of things that Facebook is doing,

69
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.810
but sometimes I think he makes it look worse by the way he presents himself

70
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.490
about those things. Like,

71
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.290
I honestly think that a large amount of people at Facebook just have a

72
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.220
huge unstable, chaotic system and they're all,

73
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.720
not all, but a mass or trying to do good with this chaotic system.

74
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.650
But the presentation is like, it sounds like there's a lot of, uh,

75
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.210
back room conversations that are trying to manipulate people. Uh, and there's,

76
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.850
there's something about the realness that Elon has that it feels like CEO's

77
00:04:37.851 --> 00:04:39.630
should have had that opportunity.

78
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.080
<v 1>I think Mark's like Barry had that too, when he was younger, younger,</v>

79
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.800
and somebody said, you gotta be more professional, man. You can't say, you know,

80
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.950
law to an interview. Uh,

81
00:04:49.951 --> 00:04:54.300
and then suddenly he became like this distance person that was hot. I'd like,

82
00:04:54.301 --> 00:04:56.040
you'd rather have him make mistakes,

83
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.790
but be honest than be like professional and never make mistakes.

84
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.260
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

85
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.210
One of the difficult hires I think is like marketing

86
00:05:06.211 --> 00:05:11.160
people or like PR people is you have to hire people that get the fact that

87
00:05:11.161 --> 00:05:15.390
you can say law on an interview, or I,

88
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:16.230
you know,

89
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.210
take risks as opposed to what the PR I thought to quite a

90
00:05:21.211 --> 00:05:25.860
few big CEOs and the people around

91
00:05:25.861 --> 00:05:30.150
them are trying to constantly minimize the risk of like, what did he say?

92
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.490
The wrong thing? What does she says the wrong thing? It's like,

93
00:05:32.491 --> 00:05:36.480
what the be careful it's constantly like, Ooh, like, I don't know.

94
00:05:36.481 --> 00:05:39.720
And there's this nervous energy that builds up over time with larger,

95
00:05:39.721 --> 00:05:44.250
larger teams where the whole thing, like I visited YouTube, for example,

96
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.110
everybody had talked YouTube, incredible engineering and incredible system,

97
00:05:49.111 --> 00:05:53.040
but everybody's scared. Like, let's be, uh,

98
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.010
let's be honest about this like madness that we have going on of huge

99
00:05:58.011 --> 00:06:00.140
amounts of video that we can't possibly ever handle.

100
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.010
There's a bunch of hate on YouTube. There's this chaos of comments,

101
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.710
bunch of conspiracy theories, some of which might be true.

102
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.130
And then just like this mess that we're dealing with,

103
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:12.890
and it's exciting as beautiful. Uh,

104
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.490
it's a place where like democratizes education, all that kind of stuff.

105
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.930
And instead they're all like sitting in like VR trying to be very polite and

106
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:24.380
saying like, well, we're just a one to improve the health of our platforms.

107
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:29.180
Like, all right, man, let's just be real. Let's,

108
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.900
let's, let's both advertise how amazing this fricking thing is.

109
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.720
But also to say like, we don't know what we're doing.

110
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.170
We have all these Nazis posting videos on YouTube. We don't,

111
00:06:39.171 --> 00:06:42.590
we don't know how to like handle it and just being real like that.

112
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.300
I suppose that's just a skill. Um, maybe it can't be taught, but over time,

113
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.730
the, whatever the dynamics of the company is,

114
00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:53.510
it does seem like Zuckerberg and all this get worn down. They just get tired.

115
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.820
They get tired of not being real of not being real, which is a sad.
