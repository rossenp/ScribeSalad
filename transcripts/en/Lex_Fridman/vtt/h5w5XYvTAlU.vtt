00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.550
<v 0>I just bought three books on boredom the other day. Uh,</v>

2
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.870
so now I'm really interested in this topic because I,

3
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.910
I was anxious about my book launch happening this week. So I was like, okay,

4
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.150
I need something else to, so I have this idea for a,

5
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.310
I might do a as an article first, but as a book, like, okay,

6
00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:21.430
I need something cool to be thinking about because I was worried about like,

7
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.460
I don't have, is the launch gonna the pandemic what's gonna happen?

8
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.900
I don't know if it's gonna get to that. So I,

9
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.460
this is exactly what we're talking about.

10
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.100
So I went out and I bought a bunch of books and I'm beginning like a whole, uh,

11
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.020
sort of intellectual exploration.

12
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.940
<v 1>Well,</v>

13
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.740
I think that's one of the profound ideas and deep work that you don't expand on,

14
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.340
uh, too much is, uh.

15
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.290
<v 0>Boredom. Yeah. Well, so it work had a,</v>

16
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.370
a superficial idea about boredom, which, which was, uh,

17
00:00:47.371 --> 00:00:51.770
I had this chapter called embrace boredom and a very functionalist idea was

18
00:00:51.771 --> 00:00:52.604
basically,

19
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.450
you have to have some boredom in your regular schedule or your mind is gonna

20
00:00:56.451 --> 00:01:01.250
form a Pavlovian connection between as soon as I feel boredom, I get stimuli.

21
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.970
And once it forms that connection, it's never gonna tolerate deep.

22
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.680
So there's this very pragmatic treatment of boredom of your mind,

23
00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:11.520
better be used to the idea that sometimes you don't get stimulated because

24
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:13.600
otherwise you can't write for three hours. Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; like, it's,

25
00:01:13.601 --> 00:01:16.320
it's just not gonna tolerate it. But more, more recently,

26
00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:20.360
what I'm really interested in boredom is it as a fundamental human drive, right?

27
00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:21.960
Because it's incredibly uncomfortable.

28
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.950
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and think about the other things that incredibly

29
00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:26.270
uncomfortable, like hunger or thirst,

30
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.430
they serve a really important purpose for a species, right? Like if,

31
00:01:30.431 --> 00:01:32.070
if something is really distressing, there's a reason,

32
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.430
pain is really uncomfortable because we need to worry about getting injured.

33
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.390
Thirst is really uncomfortable because we need water to survive.

34
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.350
So what's boredom. Why is that uncomfortable? And,

35
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.780
and I've been interested in this notion that boredom is about

36
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.020
driving us towards productive action, like as a species. I mean,

37
00:01:52.021 --> 00:01:53.020
think about it. Like what,

38
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.780
what got us to actually take advantage of these brains?

39
00:01:55.781 --> 00:01:57.780
What got us to actually work with fire?

40
00:01:57.781 --> 00:02:01.820
What got us to start shaping stones and the hand AEs and figuring out if we

41
00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:05.260
could actually sharpen a stick sharp enough that we could throw it as a Melia

42
00:02:05.261 --> 00:02:08.090
weapon or a, a distance weapon for hunting mammoth, right.

43
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.210
Boredom drives us towards action. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

44
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.850
So now I'm fascinated by this fundamental action instinct, uh,

45
00:02:14.851 --> 00:02:19.010
because I have this theory that I'm working on that we're outta sync with it,

46
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.050
just like we got, we have this drive for hunger,

47
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.690
but then we introduce junk food and got outta sync with hunger. And,

48
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.680
and it makes us really unhealthy. We have this drive for towards action,

49
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.120
but then we, we overload ourselves and we have all of these distractions.

50
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:34.680
And then that causes, uh, it's like a cognitive action obesity type things.

51
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.840
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; because it short circuits,

52
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.080
the system that wants us to do things,

53
00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:39.080
but we put more things in our plate and we can possibly do.

54
00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:41.320
And then we're really frustrated. We can't do 'em and we're,

55
00:02:41.321 --> 00:02:43.720
we're short circuiting, all of our wires. So it all comes back to this question.

56
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.120
Well, what would be the ideal?

57
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.390
&lt;affirmative&gt; the ideal sort of amount of stuff to do and type of things to do.

58
00:02:51.391 --> 00:02:53.950
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like if we wanted to look back at our ancestral environment

59
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.750
and say, if I could just build from scratch, what type,

60
00:02:57.751 --> 00:03:01.800
how much work I do and what I work on to be as in touch with that as like paleo

61
00:03:01.801 --> 00:03:04.280
people are trying to get their diets in touch with that. And so now I'm just,

62
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.040
well, see, this is, I'm just, it's something I made up. Yeah.

63
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.960
But now I'm going deep on it. And one of my podcast listeners, I was,

64
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.880
I was talking about on the show and I was like, well,

65
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.720
I kept trying to learn about animals and boredom.

66
00:03:14.721 --> 00:03:18.080
And she sent me this cool article from an animal behavioralist journal about

67
00:03:18.081 --> 00:03:21.110
what we know about human boredom versus animal boredom.

68
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.550
So trying to figure out that puzzle is, uh, the wave that's high.

69
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.510
So I can get through the wave. That's low of, like,

70
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.750
I don't know about this pandemic book launch and, you know, yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; and,

71
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.830
and my research, my research is stumbling a little bit because of the pandemic.

72
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.990
And so I needed a nice, you know, high. So there we go. There's a case study.

73
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.740
<v 1>The, it is both a case study and a very interesting set of concepts.</v>

74
00:03:42.741 --> 00:03:44.940
Cause I didn't even realize that it's so simple.

75
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.260
I'm one of the people that, uh,

76
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.260
has a interesting push and pull dynamic with hunger,

77
00:03:52.261 --> 00:03:54.300
trying to understand the hunger with myself.

78
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.460
Like I probably have a unhealthy relationship with food. I don't know,

79
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.170
but there's probably a perfect,

80
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.170
that's a nice way to think about diet as action.

81
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.570
There's probably an optimal diet response to the,

82
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.290
the experience that our body's telling us, the signal that our body's sending,

83
00:04:15.291 --> 00:04:17.410
which is hunger. Yeah. And in that same way,

84
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.680
boredom is sending a signal and most of our intellectual activities in this

85
00:04:22.681 --> 00:04:26.800
world are creative activities are essentially a response,

86
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.720
uh, to that signal.

87
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.360
<v 0>Yeah. And, and think about this analogy that we have, this hunger instinct,</v>

88
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.960
that junk food short circuits. Yes. Right. It's like, oh, we'll,

89
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.870
we'll satisfy that hyper palatably and it doesn't up.

90
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.630
Well now think about modern attention engineered,

91
00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.070
digitally mediated entertainment. We have this board of instinct. Oh, we can,

92
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.230
we can take care of that with a hyper palatable alternative.

93
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.750
Is that gonna lead to a similar problem? So.

94
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.390
<v 1>I've been fasting a lot lately. Like, uh, I'm doing, um,</v>

95
00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.380
eating once a day. I've been doing that for over a month,

96
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.820
just eating one meal a day and primarily meat, but it's very,

97
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.420
uh, fasting has been incredible for me for focus for wellbeing,

98
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.340
for feel. I don't, I don't know, just for feeling good. Okay.

99
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.740
Well put on a chart. What makes me feel good? And, uh,

100
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.170
that fasting and eating primarily a meat based diet makes me feel really good.

101
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.210
And so, but that ultimately what fasting did,

102
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.770
I haven't fasted super long yet like a seven day diet,

103
00:05:33.771 --> 00:05:34.970
which I really like to do,

104
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.370
but even just fasting for a day for 24 hours gets you in touch with

105
00:05:40.371 --> 00:05:44.160
your, with the sick. No, it's fascinating.

106
00:05:44.161 --> 00:05:48.120
Like you get to listen to your learn to listen to your body that like,

107
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.560
you know, it's okay to be hungry.

108
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.560
It's like a little signal that sends you stuff. And then, and then, uh,

109
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.600
I get to listen to how it responds when I put food in

110
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.840
my body. Like, and I get to like, okay, cool.

111
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.680
So like food is a thing that pacifies this signal. Like it sounds ridiculous.

112
00:06:08.681 --> 00:06:10.920
Okay. No, you could do that with and do different types of food.

113
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.760
It feels different. So you learn about what your body wants. For some reason,

114
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.150
fast, the it's similar to the deep work, embrace boredom.

115
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.790
Fasting allowed me to go into mode of listening,

116
00:06:23.791 --> 00:06:26.310
of trying to understand the signal that I could say.

117
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.670
I have an unhealthy appreciation of fruit. Okay.

118
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.390
I love apples and cherries. Like I don't know how to moderate them.

119
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.220
So if you take just same amount of calories, don't know calories matter.

120
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.420
But as I say, calories,

121
00:06:39.421 --> 00:06:44.140
2000 calories of cherries versus 2000 calories of

122
00:06:44.141 --> 00:06:46.700
steak. If I eat 2000 calories of steak,

123
00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:49.740
maybe with just a little bit of like green beans or cauliflower,

124
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.660
I'm going to feel really good, fulfilled, focused, and happy. Yeah.

125
00:06:55.661 --> 00:06:57.810
If I eat cherries, I'm going to be,

126
00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.730
I'm gonna wake up behind a dumpster crying with like naked and like,

127
00:07:02.731 --> 00:07:05.730
it just hits all around. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; with everything face. Yeah.

128
00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:11.090
And it's just like bloated, just not and unhappy. And also the,

129
00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.370
the mood swings up and down. I don't know. Uh,

130
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:19.400
and I'll be much hungrier the next day. Sometimes it takes a couple days.

131
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.320
Yeah. But when I introduce carbs into the system too many carbs, I, it starts,

132
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.200
it's just unhealth. It's a,

133
00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.400
I go into this rollercoaster as opposed to a calm boat ride along the river and

134
00:07:30.401 --> 00:07:34.480
the Amazon or stuff like that. Yeah. And so fasting was the mechanism of,

135
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:39.390
for me to start listening to the body. I wonder if you can do that same kind of,

136
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.510
I guess that's what meditation a little bit is a little bit, but yeah.

137
00:07:42.511 --> 00:07:43.190
Listen to boredom.
