00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.690
<v 0>As a small little quirk of history,</v>

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.530
it seems like you're related to Jordan Peterson.

3
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.650
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like you mentioned, he's going through some rough stuff.

4
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.650
Now, is there some common you can make about the,

5
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.930
the roughness of the human journey, ups and downs? Well.

6
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.550
<v 1>I, I became a expert in, uh, benzo withdrawal, like,</v>

7
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.030
which is you took benzo aspens.

8
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:34.470
And at some point they interact with GABA circuits,

9
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.190
you know, to reduce anxiety and do a hundred other things.

10
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.390
Like there's actually no known list of everything they do.

11
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.870
Cause they interact with so many parts of your body. I,

12
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.500
and then once you're on 'em you habituate to them and you're you're you have a

13
00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:51.500
dependency. It's not like you're a drug dependency. You're trying to get high.

14
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.540
It's a, it's a metabolic dependency.

15
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.300
And then if you discontinue them,

16
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.500
there's a funny thing called kindling,

17
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.260
which is if you stop them and then go, you know,

18
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.010
you have a horrible withdrawal symptoms.

19
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.690
And if you go back on them at the same level, you won't be stable.

20
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.650
And that unfortunately happened to.

21
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.251
<v 0>Him like,</v>

22
00:01:12.251 --> 00:01:15.490
because it's so deeply integrated into all the kinds of systems in the body, it.

23
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.370
<v 1>Literally changes the size of numbers of neurotransmitter sites in your brain.</v>

24
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.010
Yeah. So there's a,

25
00:01:21.011 --> 00:01:25.760
there's a process called the Ashton protocol where you taper it down slowly over

26
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.320
two years to people go through that, go through unbelievable hell.

27
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.480
And what Jordan went through seemed to be worse because he on advice of doctors,

28
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.000
you know, well, stop taking these and take this. It was disaster. And he,

29
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.520
he got some, yeah, it was pretty tough. Um,

30
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.320
he seems to be doing quite a bit better intellectually.

31
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.310
You can see his brain clicking back together. I spent a lot of time with,

32
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.710
I've never seen anybody suffer so much.

33
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.070
<v 0>Well, his brain is also like this powerhouse, right?</v>

34
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.150
So I wonder does a brain that's able to think deeply about

35
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.870
the world, suffer more through these kinds of withdrawals. Like.

36
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.470
<v 1>I don't know. I've, I've watched videos of people going through withdrawal.</v>

37
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.940
They all seem to suffer unbelievably.

38
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.393
And you know,

39
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.620
my heart goes out to everybody and there's some funny math about this.

40
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.420
Some doctors said as best you can tell, you know,

41
00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:21.140
there's the standard recommendations don't take 'em for more than months.

42
00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:25.660
And then taper over a couple of weeks. Many doctors prescribe 'em endlessly,

43
00:02:25.661 --> 00:02:29.530
which is again the protocol, but it's common, right?

44
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.530
And then something like 75% of people when they taper it, it's, you know,

45
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.970
half the people have difficulty, but 75% get off. Okay.

46
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.610
20% have severe difficulty and 5% have life threatening difficulty.

47
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.370
And if you're one of those, it's really bad.

48
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.360
And the stories that people have on this is heartbreaking and,

49
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.560
and tough. So.

50
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.320
<v 0>You put some of the fault that the doctors that just not know what the hell</v>

51
00:02:54.321 --> 00:02:55.240
they're doing. Oh.

52
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.320
<v 1>No, it's hard to say it's,</v>

53
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.920
it's one of those commonly prescribed things like one doctor said,

54
00:03:00.921 --> 00:03:04.000
what happens is if you're prescribed them for a reason,

55
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.680
and then you have a hard time getting off the protocol basically says,

56
00:03:07.681 --> 00:03:12.360
you're either crazy or dependent and you get kind of pushed into

57
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.320
a different treatment regime.

58
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.440
You're a drug drug addict or a psychiatric patient. And so,

59
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.510
so like one doctor said, you know,

60
00:03:20.511 --> 00:03:22.910
I prescribed 'em for 10 years thinking I was helping my patients.

61
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.070
And I realized I was really harming them. And you know, the,

62
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.030
the awareness of that is slowly coming up. Um, the,

63
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:35.510
the fact that they're casually prescribed to people is horrible

64
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.580
and it's bloody scary. And some people are stable on 'em,

65
00:03:41.581 --> 00:03:43.460
but they're on 'em for life. Like once you, you know,

66
00:03:43.461 --> 00:03:44.820
it's another one of those drugs that,

67
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.620
but benzo's long range have real impacts on your personality.

68
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.380
People talk about the benzo bubble,

69
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.060
where you get disassociated from reality in your friends a little bit it's it's,

70
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.180
it's, it's really.

71
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.460
<v 0>Terrible. The mind is terrifying. We're talking about how a,</v>

72
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.850
how the infinite possibility of fun &lt;laugh&gt;,

73
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.090
but like it's the infinite possibility of suffering too,

74
00:04:05.091 --> 00:04:09.570
which is one of the dangers of, uh, like expansion of the human mind.

75
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.793
It's like,

76
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.650
I wonder if all the possible hum experiences that it intelligent computer

77
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.560
can have, is it mostly fun or is it suffering?

78
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.040
So like, if you, if you, uh, brute force expand

79
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.080
the set of possibilities, like,

80
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.200
are you going to run into some trouble in terms of like torture and suffering

81
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:32.930
and so on,

82
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.640
maybe our human brain is just protecting us from much more possible pain and

83
00:04:37.641 --> 00:04:38.474
suffering,

84
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.470
maybe the space of pain it's like much larger than we could possibly imagine.

85
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:44.610
And that.

86
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.950
<v 1>The world's in a balance, you know, all the,</v>

87
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.990
all the literature on religion and stuff is, you know,

88
00:04:50.991 --> 00:04:55.830
the struggle between court good and evil is, is balance for very finely tuned,

89
00:04:55.831 --> 00:04:58.430
for reasons that are complicated, but that's all,

90
00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:00.270
that's a long philosophical conversation.
