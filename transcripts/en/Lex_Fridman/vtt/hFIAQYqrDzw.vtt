1
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.950
<v 0>You mentioned your father. What have you learned from your dad?</v>

2
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.750
You mentioned he was an important.

3
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.070
<v 1>Part of your childhood. Yeah, my dad is amazing. I grew up,</v>

4
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.270
we didn't have a lot of money,

5
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.870
but it doesn't mean if I'm born in a nice country.

6
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.030
That always nice thing happened. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know, um,

7
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.940
my dad for me is, is a big role model because I see him through,

8
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.460
through my life facing a lot of adversity, you know, he, um,

9
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.820
he stopped drinking when I was a teenager,

10
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.860
he was an alcoholic and I've seen him struggle through that, you know,

11
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.940
and it was very, very hard. And, um,

12
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.500
I've seen him work.

13
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.370
&lt;affirmative&gt; like crazy hours. Like,

14
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.330
come leave in the morning, come home at night,

15
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.570
burned out because of work to almost all his life,

16
00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.130
to the point that it became a slave of the system.

17
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.000
Yes. It became an ABI and a normal way of living.

18
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.550
And it make me realize that I've learned a lot through my father.

19
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.430
He taught me perseverance hard work. You know, when you face adversity,

20
00:01:15.431 --> 00:01:19.470
you know, to never give up until you achieve it. But also it,

21
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.950
it taught me a, a lesson that

22
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.110
in a way that I don't want to be like him, even if he is happy

23
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.590
it's because I realize, I don't think he knows anything else.

24
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.750
Like he works through all his life and I don't want to live

25
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.790
to work. I wanna work for, for, you know what I mean?

26
00:01:39.791 --> 00:01:42.510
I wanna decide when I work, you know, I feel like, like he, he, he,

27
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.740
he lived to work instead of working for a living and perhaps

28
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.380
it's because he did not have choice. He, he was the older of his family.

29
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.620
They had, they were nine kid. His dad, my grandfather died when he was young.

30
00:01:57.621 --> 00:02:00.700
So he had to become the father of the family and,

31
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.820
and work to put money on the table.

32
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.370
So perhaps that what made him that way, and it became like,

33
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.570
like an AB for him. My dad taught me, uh,

34
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.770
when I was at school, I, I was bullied at school.

35
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.170
He's the first one who initiate me to martial art. He taught me Chira. My dad,

36
00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:24.370
my dad was a black belt in Chi CA as well, very nice.

37
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.320
But because he was working too much, you didn't have time to teach me.

38
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.720
And I needed self defense in order to defend myself.

39
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.080
I have a winning, a great cover in mixed martial art, but in, uh,

40
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.480
in the schoolyard, uh, &lt;laugh&gt;, that's so good. My, my, my mixed record, my, my,

41
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.400
my, my, my record is not very good.

42
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.710
&lt;laugh&gt; when you're a kid and you're about

43
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.790
seven, eight years old, and you're facing bullied bullies that are

44
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.970
two to three years older than, than yourself.

45
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.840
It's not the same thing than when you're 25 and the guy is 28.

46
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.480
So there was a big discrepancy in terms of, uh, maturity.

47
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.880
So my dad taught me, introduced me to karate. Then he,

48
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.440
I didn't, he didn't have time to teach me. Then he put me in a,

49
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.870
with a teacher that it was Jean KUER and

50
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.310
I grew up with a lot of anger. And, uh,

51
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.150
there were two person that was afraid growing up was my dad.

52
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.710
My dad was very severe, very strict with me, and I'm glad he was because I,

53
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.900
I could have become very bad. I could have become chosen and a different path.

54
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.460
People see me as a nice guy. And I'm, I am a nice guy.

55
00:03:47.461 --> 00:03:48.580
I try to be a good role model,

56
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.540
but I could easily have turned towards around.

57
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.140
<v 0>There's darkness, somewhere in there.</v>

58
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.020
<v 1>Yes, they are a lot. A lot of my friend have choose that, that path. And,</v>

59
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.810
you know, they, they, they are, they, they are, uh, they're not with me today,

60
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.770
even if I'm from Canada and Canada seems like the nicest country in the world.

61
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.930
Like I said, it's even if you live in the nice country, not always nice thing,

62
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.970
depend of the situation, but that's what my dad taught me, you know? And he,

63
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.280
he gave me that to, to, because I,

64
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.360
I, I'm very good at learning by observing people. And by observing him, I,

65
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.880
I see the, the struggle he had with a alcoholism and, and what he did, the, the,

66
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.000
the pain sometimes that he inflict to, to, to us, to my family,

67
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.070
but how he turn,

68
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.750
he did that 180 degree, and I really admire that.

69
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.590
And I know it was, uh, very, very hard for him and he did it, you know, and, uh,

70
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.710
for me, uh, that's a great, uh, role model for me.

71
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.430
<v 0>So with your dad being an engine of basically hard work and you finding</v>

72
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.420
a balance of be being able to work your off,

73
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.140
but also to be able to enjoy a piece of chocolate,

74
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.980
what does a perfect day in the life of George San Pierre look like?

75
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.980
So like, if you were to go through a day, that's very productive,

76
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.500
but also one makes you sit back and enjoy and say, that was a good day.

77
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.130
What's that look like? What are we talking about? When do you wake up?

78
00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:26.570
What do you eat? What do you do?

79
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.370
<v 1>It changed over the years when I was younger, I have a, a good day.</v>

80
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.730
It was like a good training session or, or, you know,

81
00:05:32.731 --> 00:05:35.330
achieving good thing in my training, you know?

82
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.090
And that's why I was very good at it because when I, I was obsessed, you know,

83
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.360
I think to be good at something, you, you need to become obsessed. And to me,

84
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.840
perfor, performing in my training was everything. You know,

85
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.800
like when I had a bad training session, I didn't tell my training partner.

86
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.480
I was acting like a, like, because of the, my ego. I didn't, you know,

87
00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.040
I didn't tell nobody. I was like, Hey, then I go in the locker room. I'm like,

88
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.280
man, then, then I'm playing the, the, the,

89
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.120
the training in my mind, you know, I'm saying, okay,

90
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:12.200
I should have done this shouldn. I done. And it hunt me. It hunt me, man.

91
00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:12.880
It's a training.

92
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.590
And it hunt me until the next training session when I can redeem

93
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:18.483
myself.

94
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.710
That's how it is when we used to train in,

95
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.870
in altogether, back in the day in Canada,

96
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.870
we had David Zo. We had Patrick cut.

97
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.310
We had, uh, Dennis gang. Uh, Steve

98
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.880
is all like the,

99
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.380
the best guy in Canada that we're training with each other before we were

100
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.940
training in different gyms. But once a week,

101
00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.060
I made it in a way I contact everybody that we all joined for and we exchanged

102
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:55.540
ideas and we trained with each other. So a friendly, I would say,

103
00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.810
friendly competition. It was not mall mal, but it was hard training. You know,

104
00:06:59.811 --> 00:07:04.130
like not our goal is, was to improve, you know, but it wasn't very competitive.

105
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.610
And when that day you used to get out of the training session with a bad

106
00:07:09.611 --> 00:07:10.690
performance. For me,

107
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:16.010
you used to hunt me until the following week when I could give it back and,

108
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.720
and perform better with guy that had the most trouble with that's,

109
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:23.960
how it was. And that's how you get better, you know, but,

110
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.480
but it was not a, a training where it, it, it was,

111
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.280
what're trying to do malicious thing to one another. You know what I mean?

112
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.440
You need to be playful, but playful,

113
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:39.190
but competitive that when had a good training session because of spur was on a

114
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:43.150
Friday, I had the best weekend and what I was going out with, my friend,

115
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:48.270
drinking and partying and having fun that, that was, that was my, my,

116
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.430
my, uh, my ideal day back in the day

117
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:57.810
today is change. You know, my, my, my, my life has changed, you know, like, um,

118
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.150
I, I am not the same person I used to be when I go,

119
00:08:04.151 --> 00:08:08.310
went on my knees and begged the UFC for title shut. You know what I mean? I,

120
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:12.270
I am, uh, I'm wealthy, I'm healthy.

121
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.030
Most importantly, that's the most important thing. And as

122
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.850
man, I'm gonna tell you the truth, as good as my career was I man,

123
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:26.570
my private life man, is a million time better, man.

124
00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.690
I, I, and, and people ask me sometimes they always wonder they,

125
00:08:30.691 --> 00:08:34.970
they try to ask me and it's normal. It's a lot of people is curious. And the,

126
00:08:34.971 --> 00:08:35.804
the reporter

127
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:41.880
and in the sport of mixed martial art, we say,

128
00:08:41.881 --> 00:08:45.440
we play basketball. We play soccer, but you don't play fighting.

129
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.360
So when you expose your private life,

130
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.240
we seen that happen in the fight with sometime con McGregor.

131
00:08:52.241 --> 00:08:57.040
And KIB your competitor knows that he cannot get to use

132
00:08:57.041 --> 00:09:01.400
what he will do. He will try to get to someone that you love. So me,

133
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.800
I never expose my, my private life.

134
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.360
I never post Instagram of my family of my stuff.

135
00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.800
That's the reason why, because I'm in a, and I'm,

136
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:15.750
I'm in a business of fighting and people know that they cannot get to

137
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:17.740
me. And I believe

138
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:21.920
because I was bullied when I was young,

139
00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:25.690
I didn't realize that when I was young,

140
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:30.930
but it helps me deal with the mental warfare that I need,

141
00:09:30.931 --> 00:09:33.370
that I had to face right on in my life and mix martial art,

142
00:09:33.371 --> 00:09:38.360
because it's a very egotistic sport. And there's a lot of, a lot of,

143
00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:42.430
a lot of intimidation. And I was used to,

144
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:46.350
I I've been used to this thing when I was young. So it does not get to me,

145
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.600
however, the good way to get to me, go, go,

146
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:56.480
go, go, try to get to someone. I, I, I love now, man, I'm gonna go go.

147
00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:01.350
You know what I mean? And I'm aware of that. So in order to protect myself,

148
00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:04.950
I always, because I'm aware I'm, I'm a public person.

149
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:09.830
So I try to always keep my surrounding, like in a private.

150
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:15.110
<v 0>Yeah. One of the ways that, uh, like, uh, your, your friend of mine,</v>

151
00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:20.020
Joe Rogan has been and an inspiration that he he's got like an

152
00:10:20.021 --> 00:10:23.740
incredible family. And he, for the most part, it started to change recently.

153
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.220
Actually, it's kind of interesting, but for the most part throughout his life,

154
00:10:26.221 --> 00:10:28.180
he kept it pretty secret. Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;,

155
00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:31.260
doesn't talk about it in his com he's a comedian comedians talk about

156
00:10:31.261 --> 00:10:35.180
everything. He doesn't really talk about it. And there's something to that.

157
00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:39.610
It like preserves the magic of this, this silence of the private life. And.

158
00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:43.730
<v 1>I think it can affect the, the development of the kid.</v>

159
00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.290
If the kid grow up being, oh,

160
00:10:47.291 --> 00:10:51.250
he is the son of that guy, instead of being his own person,

161
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:56.130
you know what I mean? So, so for me, it's very important. Like,

162
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:57.930
my parents are older, it's fine.

163
00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:02.680
&lt;affirmative&gt; but it taught me a big lesson when I'm with my friend at a dinner

164
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.840
or anything, I talk with person, always share a thing. But when I'm talking,

165
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.240
I I'm aware of, of the audience when I'm in the front.

166
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:13.600
<v 0>Yeah. And I mean, but oftentimes those people are just incredible.</v>

167
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.440
It kind of makes me sad that, uh, you know,

168
00:11:17.441 --> 00:11:19.030
there's a lot of people that love you, you. Right?

169
00:11:19.031 --> 00:11:22.430
And there are a lot of really incredible people and you'll never get to really

170
00:11:22.431 --> 00:11:25.910
know their story. That's right. I mean, I don't know, for me, it makes me sad.

171
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.630
You see them like at airports and stuff,

172
00:11:27.631 --> 00:11:30.430
people will tell me they listen to this podcast or something like that.

173
00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.030
And they're, I could tell they're incredible people and it makes me,

174
00:11:34.031 --> 00:11:38.470
it's like a little goodbye of a, of a possible friend. I don't know it make,

175
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:42.460
it makes me sad. It, it makes me it's lonely.

176
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:46.660
It's almost like celebrity is a lonely thing. So the higher the celebrity,

177
00:11:46.661 --> 00:11:49.660
the more lonely you become in some kind of way.

178
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.400
But of course you have that little gem of a private life where you can.

179
00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:58.400
<v 1>Personally, I believe every relationship I, I like,</v>

180
00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:03.320
I don't like to use this term, but it's always a give and take relationship.

181
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:07.840
You know? Like you can gain something and the person like it,

182
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.080
it could be something like not material materialistic,

183
00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:15.390
like something always a good conf like someone that they can give me good

184
00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:19.910
advice. Or, or it's a word I would say like extensional,

185
00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.110
like if a pilot,

186
00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:26.070
as a cot is the cot is extend as a extensional relationship with

187
00:12:26.071 --> 00:12:30.230
him, you know? So he knows if he gets sick or he faint, he's there to make sure,

188
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.470
you know, he he's there to help you. I think in everywhere,

189
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:35.740
it's about compatibility,

190
00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.660
but it's about extensity right in a way that if that person is

191
00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:45.700
extensional and sometimes we talk about, about love. You know, like sometimes I,

192
00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:50.820
I think is, is it, is it a BS word or not? Because I, myself sometimes look at,

193
00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:55.890
I look at myself in the mirror and when I do was stupid thing,

194
00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:00.050
sometime I love myself a lot. And sometime I don't, you know what I mean?

195
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.890
Cuz I'm angry at myself. I've done stupid thing.

196
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:07.530
So that means sometime you could love could be fluctuating.

197
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:11.090
You know what I mean? How about in relationships? Sometimes you people,

198
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.930
they say, oh they love each other. But then when they divorce, they go,

199
00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:17.560
oh I want the house and the dog and the kids stay with me.

200
00:13:17.561 --> 00:13:21.680
And you know what I mean? If you love, if by definition,

201
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.120
if you really love someone

202
00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:28.880
and let's say you're an old man and you love a woman and she decide to leave you

203
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.800
for a younger man, if you really love her,

204
00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:36.480
you gonna help her pack and leave. But then nurse say sometimes we, we,

205
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.080
we want to hone.

206
00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:42.040
<v 0>Something to me, love includes the missing somebody,</v>

207
00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.840
the losing somebody, the anger at somebody,

208
00:13:44.841 --> 00:13:49.200
it's all the passion feelings towards somebody. That's all love. Like I,

209
00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:53.120
you know, it's all part of the thing. It's the ups and downs. It's uh,

210
00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:58.190
the sad things. When the feelings to its a person, the ups and downs go away.

211
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.310
The forgetting. Yeah. That's, that's the opposite of love.

212
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:03.870
So the opposite of love. Isn't hate the, to me,

213
00:14:03.871 --> 00:14:08.110
the opposite of love is forgetting and, and that's, that's a much bigger,

214
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.870
that's the depth of human connection. That's.

215
00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:11.723
<v 1>How I see love.</v>

216
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:16.940
So sometime I try to stay's and I've been ask how

217
00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.260
I try to, because I have the image of someone who's positive,

218
00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.780
but I go through my own demon as well. Sometime. However,

219
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.460
we talk about love when I was young,

220
00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:34.520
you know like, like I didn't love who I was at first.

221
00:14:34.521 --> 00:14:39.310
That's how I love. I learned to kind of love myself. You like I didn't,

222
00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:42.910
I didn't, when I was going through bullying, I was,

223
00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:46.070
I believe I was bullied because I didn't love myself. I, I, I,

224
00:14:46.071 --> 00:14:50.670
because I project a very bad image of what I think of

225
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:53.400
myself. I was a kid that lacked a lot of confidence.

226
00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.920
I was looking down when I was walking, I shrugged my shoulder.

227
00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:00.280
When someone was talking to me, I was avoiding eye contact.

228
00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.560
So I was a very easy target for bullies.

229
00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:09.640
And I think bullies are like in predatory, in, in nature,

230
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:13.390
they will hunt the, the easier pray. They don't,

231
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:17.070
they don't go the reliant don't go for the, the alpha bull.

232
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.670
They go for the one who's hold or who's sick.

233
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.990
The weakest one and bullies are the same in society, I believe.

234
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:27.890
And I didn't like to be bullied of course, but I didn't like the,

235
00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:32.200
the person that I was, but I found out to martial art,

236
00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:37.650
the respect and my,

237
00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:42.050
my coach was extraordinary to me. He taught me discipline and self,

238
00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:47.370
self strength. And I found out that I needed to, in order to love myself,

239
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:52.030
I needed to change myself because I didn't. When I looked at myself in the, my,

240
00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.660
I didn't like what I saw.

241
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:58.940
So I decided to become like someone that I would

242
00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:00.043
love.

243
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:04.540
So I tried to look people straight up and,

244
00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:05.613
and trying to

245
00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:11.460
showcase a more confident image that I had.

246
00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.970
And it was hard in the beginning because I didn't really believe in it, but I,

247
00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:18.570
I fake it until kind of, I make it.

248
00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:22.730
So when I was walking at school more and more,

249
00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:27.890
I was learning how to become more confident. And I was like taking charge. The,

250
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:31.010
the teacher was asking question. I was at first, I was never answering.

251
00:16:31.011 --> 00:16:34.720
I was like this waiting always to be the last I was, Hey, I, I,

252
00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.200
I know what the answer, this is the answer I got out of my, um,

253
00:16:39.201 --> 00:16:40.880
comfort zone, so to speak.

254
00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.080
And I wish I would tell you that I got out of bullying

255
00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:51.050
because a Hollywood story, I, I used martial art to beat up all the bullies,

256
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:53.210
but it's not how it happened to me.

257
00:16:53.211 --> 00:16:56.760
It happened because I changed myself from the inside out.

258
00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.400
And I learn how to,

259
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:03.360
because I didn't love myself in the beginning.

260
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:08.480
I learned how to become like someone that I have love.

261
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:13.000
And even now like, I'm by no mean perfect. I do a lot of stupid thing,

262
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:19.390
but I, I learn as a person and even I do as something stupid, I'm like, shoot,

263
00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:21.110
I did something stupid. I, I,

264
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.350
at least I can apologize to the person if I realize,

265
00:17:24.351 --> 00:17:28.430
and then I know that I'm not the person I was in the past.

266
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:32.510
I'm the person that I am right now.

267
00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:37.300
So I can learn and become that image of the person that I love.

268
00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.060
So in, in a way, the reason why I'm trying to be positive and I,

269
00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:45.660
and I'm able to stay positive sometime in life is because I'm always

270
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.680
trying to be like that person that I love. Yeah.

271
00:17:50.681 --> 00:17:54.440
And I think if you don't look yourself in the mirror and don't love yourself,

272
00:17:54.441 --> 00:17:56.920
or don't see any positive future for yourself,

273
00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.280
how can you change your environment? If you cannot change yourself?

274
00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.840
You know what I mean? You would never be happy if you're not happy.

275
00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:07.440
When you look at yourself in the mirror, so change yourself first,

276
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:08.990
then change your, you know,

277
00:18:08.991 --> 00:18:11.550
it's not the environment that gonna change for yourself. It it's,

278
00:18:11.551 --> 00:18:13.990
you have to go from the inside out. You know,

279
00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:20.990
this, this, I learned to martial art. I have a, had a coach who was incredible,

280
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:25.470
used to drill these, these ideas in my head and, and give me confidence.

281
00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:27.310
You know, like, like this, telling me all these,

282
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:32.300
these beautiful things about myself of an hour, he's dead now,

283
00:18:32.301 --> 00:18:36.500
unfortunately, a piece piece to him. But, uh, he was incredible, incredible.

284
00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.820
He was very, very strict. I was afraid of him.

285
00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:42.860
I was afraid of my dad and afraid of him. He couldn't teach nowadays.

286
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:46.140
Like he used to teach me because he would be in probably in jail, you know,

287
00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.340
&lt;laugh&gt; but I'm glad he did it because for that time being,

288
00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.640
that's what I needed it. And I would never have had that,

289
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.560
that career I had in mixed martial art without this, because I would,

290
00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.960
I would never have got out of my comfort zone. Would've been impossible.

291
00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:06.120
And in order to improve in life, you need to get out of your comfort zone.

292
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:09.600
It's hard. It's very hard to do and.

293
00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:13.510
<v 0>And strive to be the person that you love. I, I that's, that's,</v>

294
00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:14.790
that's beautifully put George.
