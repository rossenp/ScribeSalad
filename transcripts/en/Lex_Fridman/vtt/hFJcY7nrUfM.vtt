<v 0>I have to bring up some giant cash you. Cause I was just listening to this song.</v>

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.100
He has a ton of songs about trucking, but one of them, I was just listening to,

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.740
um, it's called all I do is drive where he's talking to an old truck driver.

4
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.793
<v 1>It goes,</v>

5
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.180
I asked him if those trucking songs tell about a life like his, he said,

6
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.770
if you want to know the truth about it, here's the way it is.

7
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.570
All I do is drive. Drive, drive, try to stay alive.

8
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:34.610
That's the course and keep my mind on my load. Keep my eye up on the road.

9
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.610
I got nothing in common with any man who's home every day at five.

10
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.330
All I do is drive, drive, drive, drive, drive drive.

11
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.960
So I gotta ask you, uh,

12
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.720
same thing that he asked the trucker &lt;laugh&gt; you worked as a trucker for six

13
00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:53.880
months and, and now while working on the previous book, um,

14
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.600
what's it like to be a truck driver? I think that captures it.

15
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.920
&lt;laugh&gt; it really does.
