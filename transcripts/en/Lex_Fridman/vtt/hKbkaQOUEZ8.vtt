1
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.720
<v 0>Let me, uh, completely shift topics on something. That's.</v>

2
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.800
<v 1>Fascinating. It's all the same topic, but great.</v>

3
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.000
<v 0>Everything is interesting. &lt;laugh&gt; uh,</v>

4
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.280
what do you think about what the hell is money and, uh,

5
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.840
the recent, the, the recent excitement around cryptocurrency

6
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.670
that, um, brings to the forefront, uh,

7
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.390
the philosophical discussion of the nature of money.

8
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.590
Are you bullish on cryptocurrency? Are you excited about it?

9
00:00:35.591 --> 00:00:38.830
What does it make you think about how the nature of money is changing?

10
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.630
<v 1>No one knows what money is probably no one ever knew.</v>

11
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.180
Go back to him at evil times, bills of exchange. Were they money?

12
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.900
Maybe it's just a semantic debate. Gold. Silver. What about copper coins?

13
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.980
What about metals that were considered legal, tender,

14
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.700
but not always circulating. Yeah. What about credit?

15
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.460
So being confused about moneys is the natural state of affairs for human beings.

16
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.770
And if there's more of that, I'd say that's probably a good thing. Now,

17
00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:07.890
crypto per se,

18
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.090
I think Bitcoin has taken over a lot of the space held by gold mm-hmm

19
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.450
&lt;affirmative&gt; that to me seems sustainable. Uh, I'm not short Bitcoin.

20
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.370
I don't have some view that the price has to be different than the current

21
00:01:22.371 --> 00:01:25.600
price, but I know it changes every moment. &lt;affirmative&gt;, uh,

22
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.280
I am deeply uncertain about the less of crypto,

23
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.320
which seems connected to ultimate visions of using it for

24
00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:37.720
transactions. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; in ways where I'm not sure whether it be,

25
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.840
you know, prediction markets or defi.

26
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.840
I'm not sure the retail demand really is there once it is regulated.

27
00:01:44.841 --> 00:01:49.070
Like everything else is, I would say I'm 40,

28
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.390
60 optimistic on those forms of crypto. That is,

29
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.830
I think it's somewhat more likely they fail than succeed,

30
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.110
but I take them very seriously. So.

31
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.270
<v 0>We're talking about it becoming one of the main currencies in the world.</v>

32
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.030
That's what.

33
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.710
<v 1>We're discussing that I don't think will happen.</v>

34
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.590
<v 0>So, but,</v>

35
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.540
but the reality is that Bitcoin used to be in the single digits of a dollar

36
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.420
and now has crossed $50,000 for a single Bitcoin.

37
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.460
Do you think it's possible? It reaches something like a million dollars?

38
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.620
<v 1>I don't think we have a good theory of the value of Bitcoin.</v>

39
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.620
If people decide it's worth a million dollars, it's worth a million dollars.

40
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.410
<v 0>But isn't that money, like you said, isn't the ultimate state of money,</v>

41
00:02:28.411 --> 00:02:30.610
confusion, or however beautifully you put it.

42
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.050
<v 1>It's like valuing and Andy Warhol painting. So when Warhol started off,</v>

43
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.130
probably those things had no value. Yeah. The sketches early sketches of shoes,

44
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.530
uh, now a good Warhol could be worth over 50 million. Yeah.

45
00:02:42.531 --> 00:02:44.730
That's an incredible rate of price. Appreciation.

46
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.400
Bitcoin is seeing a similar trajectory.

47
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.360
I don't pretend to know where it will stop,

48
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.400
but it's about trying to figure out what do people think of Andy Warhol?

49
00:02:54.401 --> 00:02:58.640
He could be outta fashion in a century, maybe. Yes, maybe no.

50
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.680
Uh, but you don't think about Warhols as money.

51
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.680
They perform some money like functions. You can even use them as collateral.

52
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.880
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; for like deals between gangs,

53
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.080
but they're not basically money nor is Bitcoin.

54
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.760
And the transactions velocity of Bitcoin, I would think is likely to fall.

55
00:03:17.761 --> 00:03:18.594
If anything.

56
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.310
<v 0>So you don't think there will be some kind of face shift will become adopted and</v>

57
00:03:22.311 --> 00:03:25.190
become mainstream for the trend for, for the main,

58
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.710
for one of the main mechanisms of transactions.

59
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.990
<v 1>Bitcoin. No. Now, you know, ether has some chance at that.</v>

60
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.990
I would bet against it, but I wouldn't give you a definitive. No. And you would,

61
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:39.660
Bitcoin is too too costly. It, it may be fine to hold it like gold,

62
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.740
but gold is also costly. Uh, you have smart people trying to make,

63
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.500
say ether much more effective as a currency than Bitcoin mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;

64
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.460
and there's certainly a decent chance they.

65
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.580
<v 0>Will succeed. Yeah. There's a lot of innovation. I mean, with smart contracts,</v>

66
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.020
with, uh, NFTs as well. There's, there's a lot of interesting,

67
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.210
I like innovations that are plugging into the human psyche somehow just like

68
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:08.850
money does, you know, money seems to be this viral thing,

69
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.650
our ideas of money. Right. And if the idea is strong enough,

70
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.810
it seems to be able to take hold,

71
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.770
like there's network effects that just take over. And like, I,

72
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.400
I particularly see that with, I'd love to get your comment on, uh, doco,

73
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.320
which is basically by a single human being Elon Musk has been created. You know,

74
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.400
it's like these celebrities can have a huge, uh,

75
00:04:32.401 --> 00:04:34.720
ripple effect on the impact of money.

76
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.720
Is it possible that in the 21st century people like

77
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.390
Elon Musk can celebrities, I don't know Donald Trump, the rock, whoever else,

78
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.750
uh, can have, can actually define, you know, the currencies that we use,

79
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.390
maybe can, can dosh going behind the primary currency of the world.

80
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.790
<v 1>I think of it as like baseball cards.</v>

81
00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.470
So right now every baseball player has a baseball card.

82
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.620
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and the players who were stars,

83
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.580
their cards can end up worth a fair amount of money. Yeah. And that's stable.

84
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.380
We've had it for many decades, uh, and sort of the player defines the card.

85
00:05:10.381 --> 00:05:14.060
They sign a contract with tops or whatever company. Now,

86
00:05:14.061 --> 00:05:17.260
could you imagine celebrities, baseball players, LeBron James,

87
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.060
having their own currencies instead of cards. Absolutely.

88
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.170
And you're somewhat seeing that right now, as you mentioned,

89
00:05:24.171 --> 00:05:26.690
artists with these unique works on the blockchain,

90
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.010
but I'm not sure those are macroeconomically important if it's just a new class

91
00:05:32.011 --> 00:05:35.770
of collectibles that people have fun with, again, I say bring it on.

92
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.490
But whether there are use cases beyond that, that challenge Fiat monies,

93
00:05:41.491 --> 00:05:46.480
which actually work very well yesterday, I sent money to,

94
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.960
uh, a family in Ethiopia that I helped support in less than 24 hours.

95
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.920
They got that money.

96
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.440
<v 0>Digitally. Yes.</v>

97
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.680
<v 1>No, not digitally through my bank, my primitive dinosaur bank,</v>

98
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.080
BB and T Mid-Atlantic bank headquartered in North Carolina, you know,

99
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:07.520
chartered by the fed regulated by the FDA C and the OCC. Now you could say,

100
00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:11.040
well, the exchange rate was not so great. Uh,

101
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.280
I don't see crypto as close to beating that. Once you take into account,

102
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.070
all of the mile problems, Fiat currency works really well.

103
00:06:21.071 --> 00:06:24.630
People are not sitting around about it. And when you talk to crypto people,

104
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.630
the number who have to postulate some outta the blue hyperinflation,

105
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.030
where there's no evidence for that whatsoever, that's to me is a sign.

106
00:06:32.031 --> 00:06:36.070
They're not thinking clearly about how hard they have to work to outcompete Fiat

107
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.143
currency.

108
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.900
<v 0>There there's a bunch of different technologies that are really exciting that</v>

109
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:46.300
don't want to address how difficult it is to outcompete the current accepted

110
00:06:46.301 --> 00:06:48.700
alternative. So for example, autonomous vehicles,

111
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.180
a lot of people are really excited. Yeah.

112
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.940
But it's not trivial to outcompete Uber, uh,

113
00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.770
on the cost and the, and the user experience and all those kinds of correct.

114
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:05.450
Sorry, Uber driven by humans. Yes. Uh, and it's not, you know,

115
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.450
that's taken for granted. I think that look, wouldn't it be amazing.

116
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.690
How amazing would the world look when the cars are driving themselves fully?

117
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.170
You know, it's gonna drive the cost down. You can remove the cost of drivers,

118
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.290
all those kinds of things, but it's,

119
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.360
you actually get down to it and have to build a business around it.

120
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.760
It's actually very difficult to do.

121
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.160
And I guess you're saying your sense is similar competition is facing

122
00:07:27.161 --> 00:07:27.910
cryptocurrency.

123
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:32.280
Like you have to actually present a killer app,

124
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.920
uh, reason to switch from Fiat currency, uh, to, uh,

125
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:39.950
to Ethereum.

126
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:44.230
<v 1>Or, and Biden. People are gonna regulate crypto and they're gonna do it soon.</v>

127
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:45.950
So something like defi,

128
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:51.150
I fully get why that is cheaper or for some can be cheaper than other ways of

129
00:07:51.151 --> 00:07:55.270
conducting financial intermediation. But some of that is regulatory arbitrage.

130
00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.180
It will not be allowed to go on forever for better or worse. Uh,

131
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.420
I would rather see it given greater tolerance. And,

132
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.100
but the point is banking lobby is strong.

133
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.980
The government will only let it run so far. There'll be capital requirements,

134
00:08:08.981 --> 00:08:12.860
reporting requirements imposed, and it will lose a lot of those advantages.
