00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.800
<v 0>How about dreams? What is a dream? Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.000
<v 1>Well, I, I, I, more and more, I don't know if you're paying attention to this.</v>

3
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:13.080
There's now it's become more acceptable in the scientific community to do large

4
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.960
scale studies of psychedelics, for example.

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.840
And there's a lot of connection between psychedelics and dreams.

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.520
There's very similar states.

7
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.110
There's there's a lot of our mind does when it's the attaches itself from

8
00:00:24.111 --> 00:00:26.710
reality that it can just explore a lot of different ideas.

9
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.830
It's very possible that dreams is you're traveling somewhere.

10
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.550
And the same thing with psychedelics, you're traveling somewhere.

11
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.310
I agree in a different, not traveling through physical space.

12
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.230
It's the other dimensions that we're talking about.

13
00:00:38.231 --> 00:00:42.390
You're traveling some other through some other dimension to meet some other

14
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.340
creature people with DMT that they meet some elves I've never done.

15
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.180
I I'd like to, I don't know if there's a safe, legal way to do it, but,

16
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.340
uh, they all talk about meeting elves &lt;laugh&gt; and like creatures,

17
00:00:56.341 --> 00:01:00.860
like entities, like who are, who are they? &lt;laugh&gt; what's &lt;laugh&gt;.

18
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.450
<v 0>What is this? Is it because they're high or it's because it really, yeah.</v>

19
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.730
<v 1>They're actually meeting something and maybe there's no difference. I mean that,</v>

20
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.970
uh, who knows exactly. And that takes us right back to us,

21
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.250
not being able to really understand how our mind works. You know,

22
00:01:16.251 --> 00:01:17.970
I work in artificial intelligence.

23
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.330
It's clear that we understand so little about intelligence,

24
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.450
some basic things about intelligence mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

25
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.800
&lt;affirmative&gt; just at the, at the very sort of basic, uh,

26
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.240
first principles level.

27
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.520
We don't understand what it means to,

28
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.840
to reason to think to a assimilate pieces of knowledge together

29
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.280
from, from the basics to the complex. We don't understand it.

30
00:01:43.281 --> 00:01:44.920
We don't understand how the human mind does it.

31
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.550
We don't understand how the human mind is able to take incredible waterfall of

32
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:54.830
information and filter cleanly into just like clean.

33
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.590
You only see the things that are important and are able to stitch jump together

34
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.750
and be able to reason about the world. And at the same time,

35
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.500
have moments of like genius of creativity. What is that?

36
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.260
That also, you know, people writers talk about that, that they're, you know,

37
00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:14.180
they're almost like communicating with amuse, like where do ideas come from?

38
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.500
Yeah, this is the Joe Rogan philosophy.

39
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.220
<v 0>But, but I,</v>

40
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.780
I do know that past civilization where a lot of them were BA based on shamanism

41
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.290
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and you know what I think it's sad is if some drink

42
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.370
alcohol and when he is drunk, he's going to commit like,

43
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.770
CRA like, like murders or so we're gonna blame the person, right? Yeah.

44
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.410
We're gonna say that's his fault. It's not the fault of alcohol. However,

45
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.490
if someone does psych or any things that is illegal and do

46
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:48.280
something crazy, now we're gonna put the fault on,

47
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.120
on psychedelic. You know what I mean?

48
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.040
And perhaps the person itself is the, the reason why,

49
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.440
you know, he is been doing these things, you know what I mean? So, yeah.

50
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:03.600
It's fascinating how, like, society, you know, like in Canada they just, uh,

51
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.520
legalize marijuana. They, oh yeah. Marijuana is legal.

52
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.040
But before that, before they did it, like, if you talk, for example to my dad,

53
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.600
my dad is against it. Like, because the whole mentality is like,

54
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.270
it's drug it's bad, but drinking a great, you know, drinking a beer, it's fine.

55
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.950
I mean, what is, you know, what, what is good? What is bad?

56
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.830
And I guess you think chocolate could be bad as well for your health, or,

57
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.310
I mean, I'm going through the extreme now, but what is good?

58
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:37.550
What is bad if you use it for recreation, you use it for an experience for,

59
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.620
to learn about your, of it's like it's, uh,

60
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.180
the line is very tidy. You know,

61
00:03:44.181 --> 00:03:48.460
there's some countries that drugs are all legal, you know what I mean? And,

62
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.380
and I, I, I don't know the, the, the stats, but I would,

63
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.420
I would be interesting to know if they have more crimes there

64
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.250
than other countries where it's more strict would I would be interesting to know

65
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.010
about that. It's fascinate me, you know? Yeah.

66
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.170
<v 1>And I mean, we,</v>

67
00:04:05.171 --> 00:04:08.290
humans kind of just come up with the arbitrary lines of what's good,

68
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.090
what's bad that applies with drugs that applies with anything, uh,

69
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.770
that applies with animals. For example, we talked about carnivore diet.

70
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.840
Maybe the time we live in now will be remembered for the cruelty to animals,

71
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.853
for example.

72
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.320
And I believe this the 21st century will be remembered

73
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.880
for our cruelties to robots that, uh, eventually &lt;laugh&gt;,

74
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.880
there'll be a civil rights movement for robots where the, the ones who,

75
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.110
uh, choose to be conscious, the ones who have consciousness will say,

76
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.790
we deserve rights, too. We deserve to be treated with respect too.

77
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.270
<v 0>How about the people we put in jail? People put in jail,</v>

78
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:53.590
maybe I think in the future,

79
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.670
we'll look back and will think of ourself being stupid to,

80
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.980
you know, to put people in jail of, you know,

81
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.620
like trying to fix the problem in, in, in, in, at the base,

82
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.180
you know, of course now we're,

83
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.260
or I guess it's our endurance that made it in a way that we cannot sort

84
00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.140
sometimes understand what makes, uh, sometime psychopath psychopath or a murder,

85
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.340
a murder, but, you know,

86
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.850
if we can pinpoint the problem and take care of it before, you know what I mean,

87
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.970
or made it in a way we can re reestablish that person in,

88
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.890
in the society, you know, who knows, you know, what was the future as old?

89
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.650
It's interesting. We live in an interesting time.
