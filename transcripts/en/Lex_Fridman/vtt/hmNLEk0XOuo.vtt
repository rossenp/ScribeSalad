WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.830
<v 0>I'd love to ask you because you were an early investor in Robyn and you're sort</v>

2
00:00:07.831 --> 00:00:12.300
of, you're in a very nice place of, uh,

3
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.940
being a huge supporter of the sort of wall street bets kind of distributed

4
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.660
power of the people. And at the same time, uh,

5
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.940
because of you being an investor,

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.890
like intellectually giving a chance to Robin hood in this kind of chaotic

7
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:33.030
time of conversations to think about like, well, what did they do? Right?

8
00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:34.140
What did they do wrong?

9
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.800
So you have a kind of a balanced view on the whole thing, which is really nice.

10
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.450
Is there, we've talked about what Robin had did, right. I think,

11
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.960
can you, uh, sort of steel man, uh,

12
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.840
at your Martha's arguments of, uh,

13
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.680
what Robin hood did wrong in the last few days?

14
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.600
<v 1>Yeah. I mean,</v>

15
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.470
their communication is always the number one issue with these startups, right?

16
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.730
And if you,

17
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.600
you have to get ahead of any problem and you have to put all the bad news out

18
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.410
immediately. And in the case of Robin hood, it seems based on what you know,

19
00:01:06.411 --> 00:01:09.290
has been in the papers and what Robin hood said publicly is that they had this

20
00:01:09.291 --> 00:01:13.070
kind of liquidity crisis, right, where they were being, uh,

21
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.420
because of these exchanges,

22
00:01:14.421 --> 00:01:17.180
telling them you have to put up this amount of money and collateral and them

23
00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:19.520
being pinned at number one in the app store,

24
00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:23.270
there were so many people trying to buy five shares of this stock,

25
00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:26.690
five shares of this meme stock that it kind of broke their system.

26
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.240
And then the people who clear the trades for them, they said,

27
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.760
you got to put up a billion dollars, $2 billion, $3 billion.

28
00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:32.960
We can't do that overnight.

29
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.210
And I think that they were an uncomfortable situation of like going on

30
00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:40.700
TV and saying, we have a liquidity crisis.

31
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.340
Like I could be like a run on the bank,

32
00:01:43.341 --> 00:01:46.520
everybody then logs in at the same time to Robin hood and tries to sell every

33
00:01:46.521 --> 00:01:48.590
share they own, because they're afraid that the whole thing's going to collapse.

34
00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:48.741
Right.

35
00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:53.090
So I think there was this kind of like black Swan event and they probably didn't

36
00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:54.290
communicate it all that well.

37
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.750
<v 0>At the center of that. This is really interesting.</v>

38
00:01:56.751 --> 00:02:01.010
Maybe you can comment on the nature of communication, uh, Vlad,

39
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.860
the CEO, the guy you met at the bar,

40
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.860
I think at the center of the communication. Right?

41
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.060
So Ilan is an example of a guy who also is at the center of the communication

42
00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:13.700
for his particular set of companies. And that, you know,

43
00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:16.520
on Twitter seems to be a really powerful way to communicate.

44
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.020
And there was something,

45
00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:22.190
this is me saying there was something about Vlad that

46
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.080
sounded like he's hiding stuff that as opposed to

47
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.100
Ilan, it doesn't sound like he's hiding stuff. It could be the nature that the,

48
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.410
the beat, the timing of the conversation, same thing with Mark Zuckerberg,

49
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.250
Mark Zuckerberg, for some reason often sounds like he's hiding something. Yeah.

50
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.670
And then there's like Jack Dorsey as much less so,

51
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.340
and I don't know what that is about the CEO's that makes you trust them and not.

52
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.820
<v 1>It might be the point in time, um, like in terms of escape, velocity,</v>

53
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.493
uh, you know,

54
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.320
there might be non-disclosures in place that we're not aware of where they're

55
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:01.180
not allowed to talk about certain relationships.

56
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.840
<v 0>And, and, and, and that results in this case and that results in you being like</v>

57
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.390
acting weird and nervous and.

58
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.390
<v 1>Oh, it could just be, the person is nervous, you know? So it's,</v>

59
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.810
it's really hard to be building one of these companies and you're at scale and,

60
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.890
you know, Oh my Lord, the entire thing's coming apart.

61
00:03:19.891 --> 00:03:21.930
And you're the most hated person for that day. You know,

62
00:03:21.931 --> 00:03:23.310
how the rage cycle works. And the,

63
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.840
the media is just so crazy when they get their hooks into something.

64
00:03:27.841 --> 00:03:31.020
I started happening with Uber. We started having with Facebook and even Tesla,

65
00:03:31.021 --> 00:03:31.231
you know,

66
00:03:31.231 --> 00:03:35.400
there were times when people did stupid things with autopilot and it's like,

67
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:36.630
okay,

68
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.530
somebody's watching a movie and sleeping in their car or leaving the driver's

69
00:03:40.531 --> 00:03:42.600
seat against all the rules of autopilot.

70
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.340
And somehow Tesla's responsible for that.

71
00:03:44.341 --> 00:03:47.730
It's like we have people who stand on top of their motorcycles and drive down

72
00:03:47.731 --> 00:03:51.710
the road on a motorcycle. And we don't blame Yamaha for,

73
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.110
or Harley Davidson versus some idiot standing on the seat of their motorcycle on

74
00:03:55.111 --> 00:03:57.960
a highway, going 60 miles an hour. We just say that person's an idiot.

75
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.860
But when new technology comes out, we blame the technology,

76
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.870
not the person operating it. And if you are going to operate,

77
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.770
uh, we basically vilified and demonized. And I think that that is part of it.

78
00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:13.950
Like when the person at, I remember Airbnb, we always thought,

79
00:04:13.951 --> 00:04:16.980
what if somebody trashes your apartment? And then sure enough,

80
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.140
a bunch of meth heads rented this poor woman's apartment.

81
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.700
She left all of her stuff in it.

82
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.600
And then a bunch of meth heads had a drug party, destroyed her apartment,

83
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.860
ripped up all our photos and went crazy. And we knew that day would happen,

84
00:04:28.861 --> 00:04:29.790
but nobody remembers it now,

85
00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:33.510
but it was the number one story on every news channel because wow,

86
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.330
that's an exciting story. And I just thought to myself,

87
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.190
I wonder if there are any parties in hotel rooms where the hotel rooms being

88
00:04:41.191 --> 00:04:44.670
trashed and people are doing drugs and crazy things. It's like, yes,

89
00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:49.110
that's basically every hotel in Los Angeles right now is being destroyed by some

90
00:04:49.111 --> 00:04:53.490
rock band. That's throwing a TV out the window, like we expected. And, uh,

91
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.490
you know, a hotel, we just didn't expect it in somebodies house with Airbnb.

92
00:04:56.491 --> 00:04:58.680
And then Airbnb created rules around you.

93
00:04:58.681 --> 00:05:01.830
Can't rent an Airbnb for a party and they learn.

94
00:05:01.831 --> 00:05:04.860
So I think there's a learning curve with these companies and they do get to

95
00:05:04.861 --> 00:05:08.010
scale at a level that is unprecedented.

96
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.340
It used to take decades for a company to become an international phenomenon.

97
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.940
Now it happens in two, three, four years. I mean, look at clubhouse.

98
00:05:14.941 --> 00:05:16.830
This thing went from being, you know,

99
00:05:16.831 --> 00:05:21.300
a private beta six months ago to being the number one app in Germany and in

100
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.970
Japan and here, like, just like that. Boom.

101
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.440
And it's because there's an ecosystem that has never existed the app store.

102
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.160
Then there's a payments online, everybody.

103
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.950
And then everybody has a super computer in their pocket. When we,

104
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.330
the thing people got wrong about entrepreneurship technology

105
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.250
and business, you know,

106
00:05:41.251 --> 00:05:44.400
over the last couple of decades was just how big the market was.

107
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.640
And then how quickly you could, um, you know,

108
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.550
achieve relevancy in these markets.

109
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.080
We thought the market was like the 60 million homes were broadband.

110
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.190
And originally it was like maybe 10 or 20, and then it became 60 million.

111
00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.660
Then I was like, okay, well, how many,

112
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.760
how many hours are you at your desktop computer? Well,

113
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.650
like probably at our computers for five hours a day,

114
00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:07.790
10 hours a day at work three hours a day on her own. And then I was like, yeah,

115
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.670
nobody's on their desktop computer. Everybody's on their mobile phone. And Oh,

116
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:11.840
and by the way, they have it with them.

117
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.070
So the people with mobile phones are now using this high-speed device with an

118
00:06:16.071 --> 00:06:19.490
app store, with their credit card in it. In the early days of the internet,

119
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.920
people were scared to put their credit card on the internet.

120
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:23.660
That was considered a really dumb thing to do.

121
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.830
If you put your credit card on the internet,

122
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:27.140
you're going to lose all your money. They're gonna,

123
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.430
they're going to hack you or whatever. And now it's just amazing to me,

124
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:32.990
how quickly when a company hits,

125
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.610
how quickly it can get to a million subscribers or 10 million or a billion.

126
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:38.520
<v 0>And users. Right.</v>

127
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.820
And there's all these networks like social networks that allow the spread of the

128
00:06:42.821 --> 00:06:46.990
viral spread of like a new startup, a new company, uh,

129
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.570
a new app to be announced, a podcast, right?

130
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.660
Single thing, just a single meme. We changed the world. Speaking of clubhouse,

131
00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.080
I just want to, we're saying so many interesting things, but there were,

132
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.770
there was a magical moment Vlad Nealon on clubhouse. I don't know it was wild.

133
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.200
Yeah. Is there, do you have thoughts about that interaction?

134
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.800
Uh, w which felt like so many, uh,

135
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:16.420
aspects of this whole situation feels like totally novel, surreal,

136
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.350
like it's defining era like a billionaire.

137
00:07:20.351 --> 00:07:24.850
The richest human on earth is interviewing, uh,

138
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.770
the person at the center of one of the most interesting mass

139
00:07:29.771 --> 00:07:34.690
scale, like, uh, power battles in finance ever.

140
00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.123
Uh, perhaps.

141
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.970
<v 1>Seven movies have been sold on two weeks.</v>

142
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.900
Just think about how fast things are moving Lexus. This thing happens.

143
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:47.350
Like people had the idea to short the stock. Six months ago,

144
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.250
they start doing their research. They build an army, they execute the trade.

145
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:52.900
The system goes down,

146
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.350
Robin hood raises three and a half billion dollars in four days.

147
00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.490
Elan is interviewing them on clubhouse on Sunday after the Wednesday had

148
00:08:00.491 --> 00:08:04.180
happened. And now here we are. It's 10 days later. Yeah.

149
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:09.400
Doesn't it feel like it's been 10 months. Yeah. It's been 10 days,

150
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:10.060
Lex.

151
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.420
<v 0>Even 10 days, 10 days. There's like a new president, all these things.</v>

152
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.470
And everyone forgot.

153
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.391
<v 1>By the way.</v>

154
00:08:16.391 --> 00:08:20.800
We also have a set revolution at the Capitol where a bunch of crazy people

155
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:23.860
who have guns and body armor,

156
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.190
and then a bunch of them who are just yellowing in cosplay,

157
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.230
took over the Capitol.
