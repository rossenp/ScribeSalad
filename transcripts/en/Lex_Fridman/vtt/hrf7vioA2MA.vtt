00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.800
<v 0>You're becoming quickly becoming more and more popular.</v>

2
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.280
Uh, speaking about political issues in part, do you feel

3
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.320
a burden, like almost like, uh, the,

4
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.840
the prison of your prior convictions of having to

5
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.150
being popular with a certain kind of audience and thereby unable to really

6
00:00:28.151 --> 00:00:29.190
think outside the box.

7
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.270
<v 1>I had, I've, I've really struggled with this. I came up in right wing media.</v>

8
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.710
I came up a much more doctrinaire conservative in my

9
00:00:39.711 --> 00:00:42.590
professional life. I wasn't always conservative. We can get to that later. Um,

10
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.563
if you want.

11
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.500
And I did feel an immense pressure after

12
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.740
Jan, after the election, by people to say,

13
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.460
wanted me to say the election was stolen.

14
00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.660
And I knew I had a sizable part of my audience. Well, here's the benefit.

15
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.220
Most people know me from rising,

16
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.970
which is with crystal and me that is inherently a left right program.

17
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.210
So it's a large audience.

18
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.410
<v 2>So I felt comfortable.</v>

19
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.330
And I knew that I could still be fine in terms of my numbers, whatever,

20
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.690
because of many people knew me who were on the left. And if, you know,

21
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.530
by right listeners abandoned me.

22
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.450
So be it mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I was had the luxury available to take that

23
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.380
choice,

24
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.360
but I still felt an immense amount of pressure to say the election was

25
00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:34.560
stolen to give credence to a lot of the stuff that Trump was doing to downplay

26
00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:35.480
January 6th,

27
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.800
to downplay many of the Republican senators or justify many of the Republican

28
00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:40.241
senators,

29
00:01:40.241 --> 00:01:44.960
some of whom I know who objected to the electoral college certification and who

30
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.190
Oaked some of the flames, um, that have eaten the Republican base.

31
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.310
<v 1>And I just wouldn't do it. And that was hard, man.</v>

32
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.670
Like I feel more politically homeless right now than I ever

33
00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:02.790
have, but I have realized the last couple of months,

34
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.260
that's the best thing that ever happened to me. It's freedom. It's true.

35
00:02:06.261 --> 00:02:10.940
Freedom. I now say, I say exactly what I think.

36
00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:14.780
And it's not that I wasn't doing that before. It's maybe, um,

37
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.860
I would avoid certain topics or like,

38
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.060
I would think about things more from a team perspective of like,

39
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.460
am I making sure that it's, it's, I'm not saying I didn't fight it. And I still,

40
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.370
I C is the right plenty and Trump plenty before the election and more it's more

41
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.233
just like,

42
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.330
I no longer feel as if I even have the illusion of a stake within the

43
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:37.330
game. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, I'm like,

44
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.410
I only look at myself as an outside observer and I will only call it as

45
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.120
I see it truly. And I, I was aspiring to that before, but I,

46
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.520
I had to have in a way, Trump stopped the steel thing.

47
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.560
It like took my shackles off 100%. Yeah. Cause I was like, no, this is.

48
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.280
And I'm gonna say it's. Yeah. And I think it's bad.

49
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.240
And I think bad for the Republican party.

50
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.760
And if people in the Republican party don't agree with me on that, that's fine.

51
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.840
I'm just not gonna be necessarily like associated with you anymore.
