WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.660
<v 0>Can we stick on the Kamo absurdism versus existentialism. Sure.</v>

2
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.980
What do you think is the difference in your ideas about, uh,

3
00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:15.220
anarchism too?

4
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.460
It seems like those are somehow intricately connected

5
00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:21.294
because, uh,

6
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.690
existentialism it's connected to freedom and freedom is connected

7
00:00:26.691 --> 00:00:27.524
to anarchism.

8
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.370
<v 1>Sure. But I mean, Sutra was a defender of the Soviet union. Uh,</v>

9
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.090
he said explicitly about things like gulags. Like even if it's true,

10
00:00:37.091 --> 00:00:40.490
we shouldn't talk about it. Um, so he it's,

11
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.410
what people don't appreciate is how, uh,

12
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.280
beings can have contradictory ideas in their minds at the same time.

13
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.160
So one would think, okay, someone's a Democrat. They think ABC,

14
00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:54.160
therefore they can think DF people could have all sorts of contradictions and

15
00:00:54.161 --> 00:00:55.400
it's not at all clear. And they'll,

16
00:00:55.401 --> 00:00:58.400
they'll have a clean conscious cuz the human mind is very sophisticated. Um,

17
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.560
and is capable of doing this.

18
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.310
<v 2>So Sarra, you know, was, you would think he's this radical in realist,</v>

19
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.870
you know, this sense of ultimate freedom, but he's defending the Soviet union.

20
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.230
Uh Kamoo on the other hand would probably be,

21
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.510
was very much like a social Democrat.

22
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.230
He didn't really talk about what politics should be so much as it shouldn't be

23
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.630
his essay reflections on the guillotine is one of the great masterpieces of all

24
00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:23.710
time, uh, an attack on the death penalty,

25
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.820
not in terms of no one's evil or it's wrong to kill murderers,

26
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.540
but in terms of what does it do for a society?

27
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.860
<v 1>If you have someone who set, takes a person and locks them in a room and says,</v>

28
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.540
you know, in two years, I'm going to murder you and you lock them for that.

29
00:01:40.541 --> 00:01:42.460
This is not someone we regard as moral,

30
00:01:42.461 --> 00:01:46.570
regardless of someone who's a complete monster, but that's what the state does,

31
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.690
you know, with a death penalty. And, and he challenges us to think,

32
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.690
is this the kind of people we want to be do? And again, he's saying,

33
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.810
I'm not saying killing a murder is wrong. I'm not saying evil is wrong.

34
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.850
His entire career was dedicated to fighting the concept of evil,

35
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.240
but are we the kind of people who want to be doing these things that in

36
00:02:09.241 --> 00:02:12.360
any other context we regard as torture or depraved.

37
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.440
So I'm much more of a Kamo person than a star Trek person. So he.

38
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.720
<v 0>Was probably against war in that same way. So I don't, I have to, uh, admit,</v>

39
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.200
I don't know much about the political side of Kamo.

40
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.761
<v 1>Well,</v>

41
00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:26.830
and I don't think his political side that interesting or relevant what I find,

42
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.910
sorry, interrupt you. I,

43
00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:31.310
what I find fascinating about Kamoo and what I think about on a daily base from

44
00:02:31.311 --> 00:02:36.150
him is his insistence that you have to live a life based

45
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.230
on conscience, that you have to be accountable to yourself.

46
00:02:39.231 --> 00:02:40.064
When you put your pill,

47
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.590
your head on the pill at the end of the day and ask yourself,

48
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.460
did I live a righteous life with integrity through to my values?

49
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.860
Did I, uh, not needlessly cause harm to innocent people? Um,

50
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.460
you know, that kind of mindset did I, if someone is weak,

51
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.160
am I using that as an opportunity to exploit them or to harm them? Or do I feel,

52
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.000
uh, a bit of sympathy or empathy for this person?

53
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.880
Because maybe they didn't have circumstances that were, you know, as, as, um,

54
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.240
uh, beneficial as other people had. Well, how does that fit?

55
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.280
<v 0>Absurdism where everything is absurd. Nothing has meaning, uh,</v>

56
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.000
you know, the really borders on nihilism.

57
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.230
<v 1>You. So he, his, he regards ni his,</v>

58
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.270
his philosophy explicitly said is a response to nihilism and a,

59
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.630
uh, attack nihilism. He, you know,

60
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.070
he regards cynicism as like the worst value people can have.

61
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.430
And I agree with him 100%,

62
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.380
a lot of times people call me cynical online and I push back a very hard because

63
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.860
to be a CI, I, you know, I had this quote and then you write where I say,

64
00:03:43.861 --> 00:03:48.260
I'd rather be naive than a cynic because a cynic is a hopeless man who projects

65
00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:53.100
his hopelessness to the world at large, uh, camu. This is the metaphor I use.

66
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.180
And I find it very inspirational. I thought it was in his work,

67
00:03:56.181 --> 00:03:58.340
but I guess I thought of it, ascribed it to him. Yeah.

68
00:03:58.341 --> 00:04:02.530
There's two types of people. You imagine you go to a mountainside and you see a,

69
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:03.130
a,

70
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.890
a blank canvas on an easel standing in front of this mountain side.

71
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.370
One, people would be like, why is this blank canvas here? You know, what, what,

72
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.050
what was this what's going on here? Uh, and just be confused.

73
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.610
Whereas the other type of person will be like this,

74
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.160
a blank canvas here in beautiful countryside.

75
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.600
What a great opportunity I can paint this river. I can paint that bird.

76
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.840
I can paint my friends or myself in the background, infinite choices.

77
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.040
And this is a gift that I have been given.

78
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.240
And I think that also ties very heavily into what I was.

79
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.760
I went to Yeshiva as a kid, which is Jewish school, what we were taught in,

80
00:04:38.761 --> 00:04:40.440
in incessantly, uh,

81
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.870
how to look at life is this beautiful gift that God has given you.

82
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.990
And that God wants you to be happy.

83
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.350
He wants you to live to the fullest in a moral way.

84
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.990
I remember the first time I went into a church and they were asking questions

85
00:04:54.991 --> 00:04:56.510
about the Jewish concept, the afterlife,

86
00:04:56.511 --> 00:04:59.670
they weren't familiar with Jewish thought and it took me a second cuz I didn't

87
00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:02.300
really have answers. And then I remembered what we were taught,

88
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.260
which is let's suppose you're at this banquet with the best chef on earth and

89
00:05:07.261 --> 00:05:10.940
the table's so heavy cuz you've got steaks and you've got chicken and you've got

90
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.580
sushi and the wines flowing and you've got your, uh, Dr. Pepper and,

91
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.660
and Mr. And Mr. P and the store brand, everything you want.

92
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.050
And you're looking around at this amazing bounty, right? Yeah.

93
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.250
And then you turn to this best chef on earth and you're like, oh,

94
00:05:25.251 --> 00:05:26.930
so what's for dessert. I mean,

95
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.250
the offensiveness of that is just so you know, insane. Like you have this,

96
00:05:32.251 --> 00:05:35.690
eat the meal. Like I promise you if I could deliver this meal,

97
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.090
the dessert's gonna be okay.

98
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.850
So this focus on the afterlife when we've been given this amazing gift,

99
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.440
uh, you know, on this earth is,

100
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.320
is a very kind of different mindset from both the Jewish traditionist I'd been

101
00:05:48.321 --> 00:05:49.720
taught. And the Kamo mindset,

102
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.360
obviously Kamo was an atheist didn't believe in an afterlife,

103
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.080
but this concept that life is a, is meaningless,

104
00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.560
but that means you have that opportunity to find value,

105
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.360
to seek for truth, to seek for happiness.
