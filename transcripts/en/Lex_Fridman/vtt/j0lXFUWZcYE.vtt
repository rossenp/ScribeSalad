00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.560
<v 0>Does history repeat itself, in which way does it repeat itself?</v>

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.680
In which way does it not?

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.040
<v 1>I'm afraid it repeats itself a lot. Um, so, uh, I,</v>

4
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.440
I think human nature kind of is what it is.

5
00:00:14.441 --> 00:00:19.120
And so we tend to see similar behavior patterns emerging

6
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.870
again and again. And so, uh, it's, it's kind of the,

7
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.510
uh, exception rather than the rule, when something new happens.

8
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.350
<v 0>What role does technology play in the suppression or in revealing human</v>

9
00:00:33.351 --> 00:00:34.184
nature?

10
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.230
<v 1>Well, the standards of living, uh, life expectancy,</v>

11
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.590
all that have gotten incredibly better within the last,

12
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.700
particularly the last a hundred years, I mean, just antibiotics, uh,

13
00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:52.580
modern vaccines, electrification, uh, the internet. Um,

14
00:00:52.581 --> 00:00:53.820
these are all, uh,

15
00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:58.780
improvements in most people's standard of living and health and longevity that,

16
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.500
um, that exceed anything that was seen before in,

17
00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:07.850
in human history. Um, so, um, so people are living longer,

18
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.330
they're generally healthier and so on. Uh, but again, um,

19
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.370
we still see a lot of the same behavior patterns, some which are, uh,

20
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.490
not very attractive.

21
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.290
<v 0>So some of it has to do with the constraints on resources,</v>

22
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.120
presumably with technology, you have less and less constraints on resources.

23
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.360
So we get to maybe emphasize the better angels of our nature

24
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.280
and in, and so doing,

25
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.400
does that not potentially fundamentally alter the,

26
00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:40.880
sort of the experience that we have of life on earth? Yeah. You know.

27
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.560
<v 1>Until the last 10 or so years, I would've, uh,</v>

28
00:01:44.561 --> 00:01:48.630
taken that view I think, but, um, you know, uh,

29
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.230
people who will find ways to be, um,

30
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.070
to be divisive and angry, um,

31
00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.670
if it scratches a kind of psychological itch that they have got. And, um,

32
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.470
we used to look at the Imar Republic. Um, what happened in the economic,

33
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.020
a collapse of Germany prior to, um, the,

34
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.140
the rise of Hitler, um, world war II, uh, and kind of, uh,

35
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.860
explain Hitler, at least partially by, um, just the,

36
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.180
the, the misery that people were living in at that time.

37
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.650
<v 0>Um, the economic collapse.</v>

38
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.730
<v 1>Yeah. Hyperinflation and unemployment, and, um, the,</v>

39
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.570
the decline in standard of, of living. And that sounds like a, a plausible, uh,

40
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.530
explanation, but there are economic troubles now, for sure,

41
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.850
we had the bank collapse in 2008, um,

42
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.240
and there's stagnation in some people's standards of living,

43
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.120
but it's hard to explain what we've seen in this country in the last few years,

44
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.800
just strictly on the basis of, uh, people are poor and angry and sad.

45
00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.160
I think they want to be angry.

46
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.200
<v 0>So without being political in a divisive kind of way,</v>

47
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.480
can we talk about the lessons you can draw from world war II? Sure.

48
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:15.120
This singular event in human history, it seems like, yeah. And yet, as you say,

49
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.790
history rhymes at the very least you yeah.

50
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.150
<v 1>Being who I am,</v>

51
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.670
I tend to focus on the curious technological things that happened

52
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.910
in, in conjunction with that war. Right. Um,

53
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.430
which may not be where you want to go, but.

54
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.790
<v 0>Uh, well, there's several things that start to interrupt. So one in crypto</v>

55
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.300
noon is more like the Allen touring side of things. Yeah. Right. Right. Then,

56
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.020
and then there there's the outside of techno. Well, first of all,

57
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:45.220
there's the tools of war. Yeah.

58
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:46.780
Which is the kind of technology mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

59
00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:49.660
but then there's just like the human nature, the nature of good and.

60
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.260
<v 1>Evil. Yeah. Well, so one of the things that emerges from, uh,</v>

61
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.060
from the war and from the, um,

62
00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.970
the extermination camps is that we were never allowed to have illusions anymore

63
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.650
about human nature. So you, you have to,

64
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.250
to learn that lesson to be an educated person,

65
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.770
and you have to know that that even in a supposedly, you know,

66
00:04:13.771 --> 00:04:17.930
enlightened civilized society, people can become monsters quite easily.
