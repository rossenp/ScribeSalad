00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.100
<v 0>Do you have advice for young people today in high school,</v>

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.620
in college of how to live a life as, uh,

3
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.860
nonlinear and as successful as yours LaMer a life that could be, uh,

4
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.013
that could be proud of?

5
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.860
<v 1>Well, like that's, that's a super compliment. I'm, I'm humbled by that.</v>

6
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.610
Actually, I, I would say a lot. I think I be proud of honestly,

7
00:00:24.611 --> 00:00:27.530
one thing that I've said to people is first, um,

8
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.050
find people you love and care about them. Like family matters to me a lot,

9
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.730
and family means people you love and have committed to. Right.

10
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.850
So it's can be whatever you, you, you mean by that, but it's it,

11
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.090
you need to have a foundation.

12
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.800
<v 2>Uh, so find people you love and wanna commit to and do that. Um,</v>

13
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.680
cuz it anchors you in a way that nothing else can. Right. And then,

14
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.760
and then you find thing, other things and then kind of from out out there,

15
00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:56.320
you find other kinds of things you can commit to whether it's ideas or,

16
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.000
or people or groups of people. Um, so, you know,

17
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.310
especially in high school, I would say don't settle on what you've think,

18
00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:05.144
you know?

19
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.230
<v 1>Right. Give yourself 10 years to think about the world.</v>

20
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.790
Like there's I see a lot of high school students who,

21
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.830
who seem to know everything already. And I, I, I think I did too.

22
00:01:14.831 --> 00:01:15.950
I think it's maybe natural, but,

23
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.870
but recognize that the things you care about you might change your perspective

24
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.740
over time. I certainly have over time is that, you know,

25
00:01:24.741 --> 00:01:27.900
I was really passionate about one specific thing and I was kind of softened,

26
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.580
you know, I was a big, um, I didn't like the federal reserve. Right.

27
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.500
&lt;laugh&gt; and there's still,

28
00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:36.460
we can have a longer conversation about monetary policy and finances, but,

29
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.660
but I'm a little more, uh, nuanced in my,

30
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.780
in my perspective at this point. Um, but you know, that's,

31
00:01:44.781 --> 00:01:47.290
that's to one area where you learn about something go, oh, I wanna attack it.

32
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.410
You know, build don't destroy, like build like, so,

33
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.410
so often the tendency is to not like something they want to go attack it.

34
00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.530
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; build something, build something to replace it. Yeah.

35
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.090
Build up, you know, attract people to your new thing. You'll get,

36
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.650
you'll be far more far better. Right.

37
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.360
You don't need to destroy something to build something else. Um,

38
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.640
so that's I guess generally, uh, and then, you know, definitely, uh,

39
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.200
like curiosity, you know, follow your curiosity mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and,

40
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.800
and let it, um, don't just follow the money.

41
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.160
<v 0>And all of that, like you said, is grounded in, um,</v>

42
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.390
family friendship and ultimately love. Yes. Which is, uh,

43
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.070
a great way to end it. Travis.

44
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.830
You're one of the most impactful people in the engineer,

45
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.790
in the computer science in the human world.

46
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.110
So I truly appreciate everything you've done.

47
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.190
And I really appreciate that you would spend your valuable time with me. It.

48
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.470
<v 1>Was an honor. It was a real pleasure for me. I appreciate that.</v>
