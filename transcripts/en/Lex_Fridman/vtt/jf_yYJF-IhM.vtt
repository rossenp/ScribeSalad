1
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.790
<v 0>Before I ask you about, uh, one, but several, uh, really exciting studies.</v>

2
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.190
Um, let me ask sort of a personal question for me.

3
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.630
So if I wanted to get psychedelics from

4
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.070
the maps, public benefit corporation and, uh,

5
00:00:22.071 --> 00:00:26.420
explore my own, um, how do I get to do that?

6
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.080
Uh, and when.

7
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.260
<v 1>You won't be able to, you'll never be able to,</v>

8
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.180
this is very unfortunate be because the,

9
00:00:32.181 --> 00:00:36.620
the reason is because the benefit Corp is designed as a pharmaceutical company.

10
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.900
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so we can only work on clinical indications.

11
00:00:40.901 --> 00:00:44.210
So let's say you, you come to me and you just say, oh, I'm really depressed.

12
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.890
Can I get MDMA to overcome my depression or overcome my PTSD?

13
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.610
You know, we'll have to do research in those indications. Um.

14
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.290
<v 0>And by when you say me, you mean like a doctor,</v>

15
00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.530
so this would be prescribed in theory, by a doctor.

16
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.610
This would go through a doctor. Yes. And a prescription. Okay. Let me, uh,

17
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.410
let me ask another question. Oh, but.

18
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.960
<v 1>Let for the, or answer. So, so that's where the drug policy arm comes in. Yes.</v>

19
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:08.000
The drug policy reform.

20
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.560
So you should be able to get access to psychedelics for your own personal

21
00:01:12.561 --> 00:01:15.280
growth. Yes, but that's not medicine.

22
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.120
So that's why we need to medicalize to have things covered by insurance

23
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.200
to change people's attitudes, the public attitudes.

24
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.150
And then we get this subsequent drug policy reform and,

25
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.750
and we're talking about it in terms of licensed legalization.

26
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.430
So my view is you should get a license to do psychedelics,

27
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.350
you get a little education stuff, and then,

28
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:38.910
then you should be able to buy it and do it on your.

29
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.350
<v 0>Own. So let me rephrase the question in more specifically. So when can I,</v>

30
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.790
if I happen to have, um,

31
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.540
ailments of some kind where the doctor decides that psychedelic could help,

32
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.020
when would you be a loose estimate for you of when a doctor will be

33
00:01:54.021 --> 00:01:57.620
able to prescribe to me something from, uh, maps, public benefit,

34
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.020
co mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then when for my personal growth and creativity,

35
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.860
would I be able to get something? So like,

36
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.690
just looking out this isn't my guarantee, but like your vision, your hope. Yeah.

37
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.650
Um, for, yeah. For, for psychedelics in society.

38
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.010
<v 1>Well, the end of 2023, so two and a half years from now,</v>

39
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.690
we anticipate FDA approval for the prescription use of M DMA for PTSD,

40
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.960
because the FDA does not, uh, regulate the practice of medicine.

41
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.680
There is what's called off-label prescription.

42
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.120
What that means the label is what it's approved for. So the label will say,

43
00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:37.040
this is approved for PTSD. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

44
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.840
but let's say you come and anything else, social anxiety or whatever,

45
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.640
you can go to the doctor, they can give it to you.

46
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.920
It might not be covered by insurance.

47
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.550
They have to be a little bit careful about milk practice if there,

48
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.110
but I think the end of 2023 is when you will be able to do that.

49
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.150
Now there's actually another program,

50
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.030
very limited called expanded access, which is compassionate use,

51
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.760
which means that,

52
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.520
and we have approval for 50 people for compassionate use right now,

53
00:03:04.521 --> 00:03:08.280
we think that'll grow. So that's gonna open up in about two months.

54
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.120
And so those are people with PTSD. They have to be treatment resistant,

55
00:03:12.121 --> 00:03:16.600
nothing has worked for them and they can access MDMA while we're doing the phase

56
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.430
three studies. Wow. And, but they have to pay for it themselves. We're not,

57
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.390
the sponsor has to pay for all the research,

58
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.870
but expanded access because there's no control group.

59
00:03:26.871 --> 00:03:30.110
Everybody gets the M D a people can pay for it themselves.

60
00:03:30.111 --> 00:03:33.430
And we think that'll start in a couple months, but it's very limited.

61
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.150
It's limited to certain cities. There's also a program called right to try,

62
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.980
which is, um, asked through Congress. It's, it's,

63
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.420
it's similar to this idea of compassionate use, but it cuts the FDA out of it.

64
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.140
And mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, um, patients can negotiate directly with, um,

65
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.020
pharma companies to get access to their drugs. Um, that's starting to happen.

66
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.740
I think in Canada now they're letting people have compassionate access to Sy

67
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.330
Ibin be for life-threatening illness,

68
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:05.250
because there has been studies with Cy for cancer patients and others with

69
00:04:05.251 --> 00:04:06.170
life-threatening illness.

70
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.130
As far as your question about when will you be able to access this for personal

71
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.450
growth outside of medicine? I'll, I'll take that to mean, you know,

72
00:04:15.451 --> 00:04:18.050
fully legally, where you can just go buy pure drugs somewhere.

73
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.890
When will that happen? You know, we already,

74
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.400
you are starting to see the decriminalization in certain areas of plants,

75
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.393
psychedelics,

76
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.280
and we see overall drug decrem like that passed in Oregon.

77
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.160
So that any drug is now, it's not legal.

78
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.680
You can't really fully set up clinics to, to offer it to people,

79
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.510
or there's no legal supply like that, but you it's decriminalized.

80
00:04:41.511 --> 00:04:45.550
So my sense of things is based a lot on watching what happened with medical

81
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.310
marijuana and marijuana legalization.

82
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.030
So we're sitting here in Massachusetts where marijuana is legal,

83
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.950
but what happened first was medical marijuana.

84
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.630
So what we see is that medicalization by

85
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.430
demonstrating that under certain contexts,

86
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.980
that risk are much less than the benefits.

87
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.940
And then there are benefits and then people hear stories about people that have

88
00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:11.700
gotten better, and then that changes their minds.

89
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.220
And then eventually that builds up to why are we throwing people in jail shift

90
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.580
the culture? Yeah. Yeah.

91
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.460
So I think that what we're gonna have 2023 is MDM a, uh,

92
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.250
approved by the FDA. Chances are psilocybin will be a year two. After that,

93
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.810
then what we're gonna need is a decade of psychedelic clinics that are gonna

94
00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:34.810
roll out across America. Also other countries as well,

95
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.770
thousands of these psychedelic clinics,

96
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.010
we already have hundreds of ketamine clinics that are ketamine for depress.

97
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.390
Um,

98
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.360
more and more people are realizing that ketamine when it's used with therapy,

99
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.640
it's better than when it's not mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. Um,

100
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.360
but the therapists want to be psychedelic therapists.

101
00:05:51.361 --> 00:05:53.960
They don't want to be a ketamine therapist or an MDMA therapist.

102
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.200
So they'll be cross-trained.

103
00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.120
So we'll have a decade of these thousands of psychedelic clinics and all these

104
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:03.840
stories of people getting better in 2035 is when I think that we will move to

105
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.400
licensed legalization, which is when you will have the option of, um,

106
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:13.080
just going somewhere, once you've, uh, done this educational stuff, potentially,

107
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.070
I also think it would be better to have the opportunity for people to go for

108
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.470
free paid for, by tax money, to these clinics.

109
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.630
And you have your first experience with psychedelics under supervision and you

110
00:06:25.631 --> 00:06:27.790
know what you're getting into mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, you've, you know,

111
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.230
task a questionnaire, what the risks are, what the drugs,

112
00:06:31.231 --> 00:06:33.950
then you get your license. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so 2035.

113
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.910
So when I think that'll happen and the clinics will be sites of these in

114
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.380
initiations. Yes.

115
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.900
<v 0>And so it'd be a safe environment, just like you said,</v>

116
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.100
all the things that are actually, um,

117
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.500
maximize the likelihood of a pleasant experience and all those kinds of things.

118
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.980
Yeah. It, it is a frustratingly slow process. Um,

119
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.060
and that FDA being part of that process is very frustrating. That,

120
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.250
of course there's there's benefits, but, uh, boy, well,

121
00:06:59.251 --> 00:07:00.450
I wish you could move a lot faster.

122
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.090
<v 1>Yeah. Well, one thing that I've learned from, uh, being a parent,</v>

123
00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.490
um, is that, um, when you have little kids,

124
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.770
it seems like they'll be with you forever,

125
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.890
but then when they grow up and they go to college and they leave,

126
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.720
do you look back and like, where did that 20 years ago? Or, you know,

127
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.280
so we're still dealing with the legacy of the civil war and slavery in America.

128
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:29.280
Yeah. So actually a 20 year plan is not that long. Yeah. So while,

129
00:07:29.281 --> 00:07:33.800
while we say, um, it's frustratingly slow and it is,

130
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.440
you know, I mean it's 50 years since, uh, the psychedelic sixties.

131
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:42.470
And you know, when right now it's, um,

132
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.830
you know, it's 36 years since MDMA was criminalized.

133
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:50.550
And you think about all those people that committed suicide from PTSD or from

134
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:55.670
anything else and all those people that could have been helped if the DEA

135
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:59.580
had accepted the administrative law judge recommendation that MDMA scan stay in

136
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.460
schedule three it's it's, it's tremendously sad at the same time,

137
00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.900
culturally evolves slowly. You know,

138
00:08:05.901 --> 00:08:07.580
you read the Bible or you read all this stuff.

139
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:09.740
We're not that different from people thousands years ago.

140
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:15.460
So how are we gonna really evolve enough over the next couple decades?

141
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.100
So we don't destroy the planet and don't kill each other. Um,

142
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.250
that's why I think, uh, psychedelics have an important role to play.

143
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:26.690
That's why I've devoted my life to psychedelics and it is frustratingly slow.

144
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:31.450
And what I said to myself is our whole effort has not been fast

145
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:31.970
enough.
