WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.290
<v 0>I mean, this is exactly what, uh, open AI and D uh, dine at Google are. Uh,</v>

2
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.043
I don't know if you've seen,

3
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.690
but there's something called reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence

4
00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:16.530
where yeah, you have, like, they've done it for like Sumo wrestling. You have,

5
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:17.703
you have like,

6
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.770
you have these two stick figures that don't even know how to get up at first.

7
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.200
And they figure out how to stand their two feet and then they figure out how to

8
00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:30.840
push the other person off of the, the, the pedestal, whatever. Wait.

9
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.720
<v 1>So, but what about like, uh, when you look at the, the Boston dynamics,</v>

10
00:00:34.721 --> 00:00:38.440
sometimes they have trouble with like jumping and balancing and the other stuff.

11
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.360
So are they, are they doing that same program or no, no, no, no.

12
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.310
<v 0>This different, uh, the everything Boston dynamics is doing, uh,</v>

13
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.830
is hard coded. So it's not, um, it's not learning the,

14
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.590
all the sophisticated movements and strategies,

15
00:00:54.591 --> 00:00:56.110
like high level strategies and movement.

16
00:00:56.111 --> 00:00:59.230
That's all something that Boston dynamics does not do.

17
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.350
And if it does it like the park or stuff, that's all hard coded and, oh,

18
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.820
interesting. The people like project and think like these robots have like,

19
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.020
discovered like how to move in sophisticated ways they haven't discussed.

20
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.340
<v 1>Well, that's what, when you and John were talking about the,</v>

21
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.820
the grappling robot. Yeah. I mean, the one thing I was,

22
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.940
I was obsessing about in my head is that with the chess, right?

23
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.570
If a chess piece moves, right, uh, the horse can move like an L, right.

24
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.650
It can only move like an L.

25
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.370
It doesn't matter if it moves at two meters per second or seven meters per

26
00:01:33.371 --> 00:01:35.410
second, it can only move. It can only move there. Right?

27
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.050
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; whereas like a single leg,

28
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.050
I can shoot a single leg with many different velocities.

29
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.970
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I can shoot a different angles.

30
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.040
I can shoot a different amounts of force. Right. I can shoot with my,

31
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.960
my head up versus my head. I mean, right. All these things are gonna matter.

32
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.120
If we're talking about &lt;laugh&gt; a human being, defending the single leg,

33
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.760
all of those things are gonna matter. And, and that's where human beings are,

34
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.240
uh, who wrestle are calculating those things.

35
00:01:58.241 --> 00:02:02.200
Subconsciously they're obviously not consciously calculating into head. Oh, the,

36
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.760
the force is coming at me at this, so I need to do that. Right.

37
00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:05.910
They're just doing feels.

38
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.190
<v 0>But see, the, the thing is, so you would absolutely.</v>

39
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.230
If you're doing a robot that you're wrestling,

40
00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:14.630
you're going to have to constrain the speed at which it moves and the power that

41
00:02:14.631 --> 00:02:19.470
it's able to, uh, deliver. So that presumably there'll be the limitation.

42
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.230
So then it'll be just the same exactly. As a human, but.

43
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.990
<v 1>Then, but, but even so if we go human max force, which Jordan bros,</v>

44
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.140
the level max force, right. &lt;affirmative&gt;, that's the highest,

45
00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:32.660
that's the highest we get. And then we go down from there. Um, even, even with,

46
00:02:32.661 --> 00:02:36.060
even within that, it's like, sometimes I can shoot single,

47
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.380
like with a maximum force of, I we'll just say, we'll say 20, this is a number,

48
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.700
right. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I don't know,

49
00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:43.660
shoot it at 20 because I feel sometimes I shoot at 15.

50
00:02:43.661 --> 00:02:46.340
Sometimes you shoot it at 12. Right? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; cause you, you,

51
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.330
something in your opponent that makes you do it differently. Yeah.

52
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.850
So they would have to learn how, and, and then, you know,

53
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.650
all of these different things and sometimes maybe I clamp a little harder.

54
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.870
So the,

55
00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.440
the robot would have to learn all these different incoming inputs to the system

56
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.473
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then create this.

57
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.240
<v 0>Reaction. Oh no, no, 100%. So this would be all continuous, like, uh,</v>

58
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.760
so unlike chess, it would not, it's just chess is discreet. There's it's, uh,

59
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.640
one and you move it. It's, it's a very specific set of moves. Now,

60
00:03:13.641 --> 00:03:14.281
here you would,

61
00:03:14.281 --> 00:03:17.520
those are all variables you control and they're continuous variables.

62
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.030
So the speed, the force there's actuators. So there's all these joints, right?

63
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.510
Yeah. You can move. I mean, it's just an optimization problem.

64
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.390
<v 1>It's kind of FA it, it is fascinating.</v>

65
00:03:27.391 --> 00:03:30.270
So I've been fascinated thinking about it since you guys talked about it. I,

66
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.550
it was a long time ago. I listened to it probably three,

67
00:03:32.551 --> 00:03:35.790
three to four weeks ago. Kind of been like obsessing about it ever since.

68
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.300
<v 0>Yeah. It just changes when and um, so unlike boxing,</v>

69
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.780
for example, or striking it, you know, once you grab ahold of somebody,

70
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.580
it, it change you're now one body mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; right? Yeah.

71
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.060
So it's very complicated. It's not just shooting a,

72
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.820
a double leg without like maybe doing like,

73
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.500
like faking a double leg and then shooting the double leg.

74
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.770
That's very do with robotics.

75
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.250
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but then like doing a clench and from there doing like a

76
00:04:05.251 --> 00:04:09.250
Russian tie mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that? Yeah. That that's, uh,

77
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.570
I think that's way harder than people realize in terms of how many things are

78
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.730
involved, like the force of the grip,

79
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.490
the leverage you're providing with all the different parts of the shoulder and

80
00:04:19.491 --> 00:04:23.920
the arm and the torso, the twist. How much is your weight? Are you allocating,

81
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:25.840
like leaning on the other person? Yeah.

82
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:29.600
Like taking weight off of one of your legs on the other leg. All of that. I,

83
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.800
I think that's a really interesting thing about humans is we're able to do all

84
00:04:33.801 --> 00:04:37.720
of this calculation subconsciously. Yeah. Subconsciously. Yeah.

85
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.280
<v 1>And that's why I've been thinking about it since we, uh,</v>

86
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.230
is like how many things,

87
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.390
even these high school athletes who are like getting medium good are

88
00:04:45.391 --> 00:04:49.070
subconsciously thinking about all the time or not even not even thinking about

89
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.110
sorry, reacting to, um, but then even like, for me, I'm, you know,

90
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:56.150
I'm a few or mag do better than some of these kids that play. And so when I,

91
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.710
when I go like super hard, it's like,

92
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.630
I can feel they're weight moving the wrong direction.

93
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.100
And for me to off-balance them or trip them or whatever,

94
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.540
it's kind of easy sometimes, you know,

95
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.660
because they're not feeling it the right way. Right.

96
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.300
Or their timing's just a little bit off or the way they're grabbing the hit.

97
00:05:12.301 --> 00:05:13.820
Maybe they should be up a little higher. Right.

98
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.380
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; these really small things. Um.

99
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.180
<v 0>Yeah. I think that's all easy to take advantage of for a robot. It's just,</v>

100
00:05:20.181 --> 00:05:24.930
there's so many things, the, the big problem is ethically.

101
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.930
I don't know how many people are willing to train with a robot because you're

102
00:05:29.931 --> 00:05:30.480
gonna get.

103
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.930
<v 1>Hurt. Well, couldn't you make a robot change the robot or no.</v>

104
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.970
<v 0>Yes. But then it's expensive. So &lt;laugh&gt; cause.</v>

105
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:38.770
<v 1>They're gonna be what's the padding on that thing.</v>

106
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.320
<v 0>I know. But they, but then it's not, you know, it,</v>

107
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.560
its &lt;laugh&gt; then, uh, you're not capturing the full, why.

108
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.640
<v 1>Can't you put like some rubber coating on 'em or you know,</v>

109
00:05:50.641 --> 00:05:51.680
something for that effect.

110
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.720
<v 0>You could, I mean, you could, yeah, you could. I mean,</v>

111
00:05:55.721 --> 00:05:59.560
you're talking about robots that are, these are humanoid robots,

112
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.640
so we're talking about 500,000 million dollar robots.

113
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.280
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so you would have to be motivated.

114
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.960
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; spend a lot of money.</v>

115
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.880
<v 0>To spend a lot of money because you have to have them wrestle for</v>

116
00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.070
like a lot to get better. Yeah. To get better. Yeah.

117
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.510
And then the, the open question is

118
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.220
how long does it take to get good enough to be a human?

119
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.140
Uh &lt;laugh&gt;. I, I don't, I don't think, I don't think we understand.

120
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.540
I don't know. I don't think you understand how hard wrestling is. Yeah. Like,

121
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.530
is it a really hard problem? We're was harder chest wrestling.

122
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.370
<v 1>Wrestling by far. Not even close.</v>

123
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.050
<v 0>That's. Yeah. That's the sense.</v>

124
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.650
<v 1>So, because there's an infinite amount of moves, right. Uh, and possibilities.</v>

125
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.890
So once I shoot the single leg, now you have X amount of choices.

126
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.490
Once you make your choice. Now I have a choice X amount of choices. Now I,

127
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.370
now you have X amount of choice in the defense and we can just keep going back

128
00:06:56.371 --> 00:06:58.680
and forth. Right. And this number becomes yeah.

129
00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:59.760
<v 0>But the same happens with chess.</v>

130
00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.320
<v 1>Correct. But then in wrestling,</v>

131
00:07:01.321 --> 00:07:05.440
you have to make these movements in very instantaneously. Right.

132
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.920
Cause I should have saying like, I'm not gonna wait and say what's your defense.

133
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.800
Yeah. Right. Instantaneously. And then also again,

134
00:07:10.801 --> 00:07:13.440
based on the force and the vectors and, and the angles,

135
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.640
you have to calculate that and adjust. So really, you know,

136
00:07:17.641 --> 00:07:20.390
if you're saying I can shoot single, like it's not like moving Che.

137
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:21.710
It is not one move. Right.

138
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.110
It's if you wanna talk about different forces and stuff,

139
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.550
it could be hundreds or thousands of different moves based on how hard I shooted

140
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.390
the angle, the direction, all of those.

141
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:30.430
<v 0>Things. Yeah. But wait a minute.</v>

142
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:33.710
So robots can do this kind of stuff really fast. You what? I,

143
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.350
people probably know the physiology of this, but it's the,

144
00:07:37.351 --> 00:07:40.700
the reaction speed for you, maybe a hundred milliseconds, something like that.

145
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:45.500
I don't know. From sensation to, to, to like from the,

146
00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.740
the signal, traveling up your, your brain and down,

147
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.780
I don't know what that number is, but, uh,

148
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.260
robots certainly could do it way faster. It,

149
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.340
you would actually have to like constrain the speed. Well.

150
00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:01.450
<v 1>So the robots already killing the chest people, right? Yes. So yeah.</v>

151
00:08:01.451 --> 00:08:03.450
Theoretically they could eventually beat wrestlers,

152
00:08:03.451 --> 00:08:06.010
but you ask what was hard wrestling or chest. Yeah.

153
00:08:06.011 --> 00:08:10.410
And I think wrestling is because of the time component in it. And then the, and,

154
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:14.930
and the physicality of, you know, is it this force or that force, you know?

155
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.050
Cause if, if I'm gonna say, say we're in a seatbelt side by side, right.

156
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.920
A wrestling seatbelt, not you, &lt;affirmative&gt;

157
00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.440
based on the pressure you're giving me, I might do a bunch of different things.

158
00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:26.440
Right. And so like, to an untrained eye,

159
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:32.200
they might both look like the same thing from you to a trained feel. It's like,

160
00:08:32.201 --> 00:08:34.680
well, in one case, it's really evident. I should go this one in another case,

161
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.640
it's really evident. I should go that.

162
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.000
<v 0>Way. So the other thing to consider, just like with chess,</v>

163
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:41.870
the AI systems.

164
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:46.670
So human versus human plays a certain way together. They actually,

165
00:08:46.671 --> 00:08:51.510
haven't considered a really large number of strategies that AI systems discover.

166
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:55.560
So one possibility with a robot they'll discover certain ties and certain take

167
00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.553
down. That's what I'm saying.

168
00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.480
&lt;laugh&gt; that like will dominate no matter what the human does. You.

169
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.600
<v 1>Think that, so you think there's that? So this, I mean,</v>

170
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.120
I'm talking about the wrestling. So fun is there's even after 80 to 90 years,

171
00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:09.160
there's this continuous evolution. Yeah. So you think.

172
00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.440
<v 0>There'll be some like low single type thing, like John Smith type of situation.</v>

173
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.670
<v 1>Well, like a down go behind is something thing that has really,</v>

174
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:18.710
I would say really in the last five-ish years has really been evolved.

175
00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:22.190
What's the go behind down block go behind. So when you're, well, they,

176
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:25.110
they just head inside or head outside matters, but there's one for both.

177
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:28.670
You shoot at me, essentially. I take my leg at boom. And then,

178
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.310
so that was kind of in existence when I was in college. Right.

179
00:09:31.311 --> 00:09:34.590
You down block 'em and you stop. But usually you hit on this side of their head.

180
00:09:34.591 --> 00:09:38.140
Right. And now immediately as you should I attack that shoulder and then I start

181
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.300
hitting a go behind on you. Right. And so like that in,

182
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:46.060
in its current incarnation, it absolutely wasn't wrong. When I was in college,

183
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:50.500
I would say it probably became popular I five to seven years ago. So yeah.

184
00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.420
There's these big things that are happening now. Now I really wanna robot.

185
00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.170
Cause I wanna be ahead of the gay. I wanna know like what I'm.

186
00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:57.910
<v 0>Missing. Exactly. I mean,</v>

187
00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:02.330
one interesting thing you have with alpha zero that plays chess is, um,

188
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.250
it sacrifices, pieces much more than humans do.

189
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:09.810
So it'll give you a piece and not only does it give you a piece,

190
00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:14.450
it will wait a bunch of moves before it makes you pay.

191
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:17.360
<v 1>So, because it knows that that's better.</v>

192
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.840
<v 0>For the long term. Yeah. Long term.</v>

193
00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:23.000
So like humans rarely sacrifice without getting the piece back,

194
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:27.920
like two or three moves after, uh, alpha zero can wait like five moves.

195
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.600
So, wow. So basically you'll have you potentially with wrestling,

196
00:10:32.601 --> 00:10:36.440
you might have a, a robot that like puts itself in bad position,

197
00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:38.990
but in a certain kind of way that that.

198
00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.510
<v 1>Will actually turn Lous to opponent in to trap. Exactly.</v>

199
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.150
Not what my style is based on. &lt;laugh&gt;.

200
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.390
<v 0>You basically narrow one, one thing to do is you narrow the set of choices.</v>

201
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:52.630
You put yourself in a bad position, but it narrows a set of choices for them.

202
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:56.150
Cause they're not used to it. Yeah. They're not used to it. And, and then you,

203
00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:00.700
you, I go into, uh, into your yeah. So, but there's also,

204
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.620
the problem is there's mechanical issues.

205
00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:08.180
Like it's actually just difficult to build robots that, uh, are able to sense.

206
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.180
Cause we have sensation throughout our body. Yeah.

207
00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:13.740
It's just difficult to build that kind of robot. It's expensive.

208
00:11:13.741 --> 00:11:18.010
You start talking about multi multimillion dollars and then people still asking

209
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.690
you questions. Why did you invest all of this money? Don't see what they.

210
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.330
<v 1>Do, duh. Hello.</v>

211
00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:25.090
<v 0>It could be better investment.</v>
