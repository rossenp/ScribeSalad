00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.370
<v 0>If you look at the history of there, our space programs,</v>

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.140
both Russian and American, you're going to find some pretty weird stuff. Pretty,

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.430
pretty weird history there, ALEKS. Um, so you want to get an idea,

4
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.180
go back to [inaudible] and read a little bit about what he has to say.

5
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.360
If you look back at the history of our space programs,

6
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.040
the viable space programs are both Russian and American and each

7
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.050
has an amazingly strange history because, uh,

8
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.530
the founders of the calculations that got us up into space,

9
00:00:34.531 --> 00:00:38.310
the rocket scientists basically were doing some pretty weird rituals and doing

10
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:42.630
religious things, right. They weren't necessarily like Jack Parsons on our side,

11
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.400
I was out in the desert with people like L Ron Hubbard and doing really

12
00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:49.140
intense rituals,

13
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.920
believing that they were opening stargates and things like that. Okay.

14
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.420
And they were really doing that. Okay. So then you go to, um,

15
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.510
the Russian side and they had a very specific

16
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.570
non-dogmatic according to Catholics or Orthodox Christianity idea of what

17
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.950
Christianity was. And they believe that they were interacting with angels. Okay.

18
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.690
Non-human intelligences. So if you look back and you see muses, you know,

19
00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:18.540
you can contextualize them within this tradition.

20
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.800
And so when I started to talk to people who were actually in the space program

21
00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:26.640
and who were in these programs that now the government has said, Oh yeah,

22
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:30.210
we do have these programs. And they have the same belief structures.

23
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.960
They believe that they were also in contact with these non-human intelligences.

24
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.740
And they were getting what they call downloads of information and creating

25
00:01:37.741 --> 00:01:39.990
sometimes with Tyler D and my book,

26
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.940
creating technologies that were real, and they were selling them on NASDAQ for,

27
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.740
you know, a lot of money, like, you know,

28
00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:50.370
say a hundred million dollars or something like that, undisclosed amounts. Um,

29
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.300
but a lot.

30
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.680
And these things are viable technologies that we use now and,

31
00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.120
and they make our lives better. And we progress as a species because of them.

32
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.190
Now that has nothing to do with the scientific method, as much as I know,

33
00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:08.610
as much as anybody's going to get angry at me for saying that, but, you know,

34
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.653
sorry,

35
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.850
there's were strange encounters that created our ability to

36
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.940
go into space. I don't know if they're real or not,

37
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.710
but these people believed they were real.

38
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:20.930
<v 1>Right. So there there's a,</v>

39
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.030
they have a power in actually having an impact in this world, in,

40
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.650
um, in inspiring humans to create technology,

41
00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:33.650
which enables us to do things we haven't been able to do before. Yeah.

42
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.910
And I like how we were putting like angels

43
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.640
alien life forms, aliens and technology,

44
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.140
all in the non-human intelligence camp, which I,

45
00:02:48.141 --> 00:02:52.640
I really liked that because this that's very true.

46
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.780
It's this other source of all wisdom

47
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.100
intelligence, maybe a connection to.

48
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.420
<v 2>The mysterious. Yes. I was really surprised by it.</v>
