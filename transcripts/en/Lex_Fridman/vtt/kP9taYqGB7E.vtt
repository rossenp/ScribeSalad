WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.080
<v 0>So how is, uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.790
if you can do sort of a big sweeping progress of JavaScript,

3
00:00:08.791 --> 00:00:12.690
how has JavaScript changed over the years in your view from those early 10 days

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.350
with a quick add an addition of garbage collection of fixes around security,

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.500
how has this evolution that now it's taken over the world.

6
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.200
<v 1>In this it's been a bumpy ride because the standards body got shut down after</v>

7
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.300
Microsoft, I think, um,

8
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.710
took over the web and then felt punished by the U S V Microsoft antitrust case.

9
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.830
Can you speak to this antibody? Like that was a fun ride too,

10
00:00:33.831 --> 00:00:35.540
because Netscape had, uh,

11
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.280
taken the lead with the web and HTML innovations, like,

12
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.380
um, frames and frame sets tables,

13
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.030
and the W3C was sort of off even then sort of an SGML land heading toward XML

14
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.080
LA LA land. I'm going to be a little harsh on it because it's GML. I'm sorry.

15
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.440
Mel was the precursor markup language to HTML,

16
00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:57.050
or it was sort of the more extensible, um,

17
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.120
generalized markup language. It was, it was a XML like brackets,

18
00:01:02.121 --> 00:01:06.470
but it had all sorts of elaborate syntax for doing, uh, different semantics.

19
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.570
And this is why I think, uh, you know,

20
00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:12.830
TBL and others who wanted to do the semantic web then took XML, um,

21
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.860
forward. But they had this, uh, or some of the many,

22
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.160
we had this strange idea they could replace the with XML or that they would

23
00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:22.790
upgrade the web to be XML. And it couldn't be done. Uh,

24
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.680
worse is better had concrete, meaning the web was very forgiving of HTML,

25
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.030
including sort of minor syntax errors that could be error corrected,

26
00:01:32.031 --> 00:01:34.730
like error correction isn't generally done in programming languages.

27
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.850
<v 0>Right. That's another amazing thing about HTML is like,</v>

28
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.130
it's more like biology than program.

29
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.680
<v 1>Yeah, exactly. And so, uh,</v>

30
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.050
XML was in its standard form super strict and could never admit it. You know,

31
00:01:48.051 --> 00:01:51.350
the kind of users who are committing these errors and the funniest part was

32
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.180
Microsoft said, Hey, we're doing XML,

33
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.450
but the way they put it in internet Explorer under the default media type,

34
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.640
put it through the HTML error corrector.

35
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.670
<v 0>So they kind of bastardized.</v>

36
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.830
<v 1>It to make it popular and usable and accessible.</v>

37
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.000
And so XML as a pure, um, you know,

38
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:09.740
thing was never going to take over. Um,

39
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.640
and that'd be three C was kind of not fully functional because Netscape wasn't

40
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.700
cooperating with them. We thought about where to take JavaScript.

41
00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:20.900
And we realized our standards guru Carl cargo realized there was a

42
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.070
European standards body that had already given Microsoft fits by standardizing

43
00:02:25.071 --> 00:02:29.510
parts of the windows three, one API, which European governments and system.

44
00:02:29.511 --> 00:02:30.380
And they said, Microsoft,

45
00:02:30.381 --> 00:02:34.070
we can't use your operating system without some standards. And Microsoft said,

46
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.070
you know, here's our docs. And the government said, no,

47
00:02:37.071 --> 00:02:38.030
we need a European standard.

48
00:02:38.031 --> 00:02:42.110
So this body called the European computer manufacturers association, eczema,

49
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.460
which eventually became global and became a proper noun instead of an acronym.

50
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.880
Right?

51
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.540
<v 0>So it's just one capital IE now with a lowercase CMA, right?</v>

52
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.800
<v 1>And as, uh,</v>

53
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.970
one of the early Microsoft guys I met when we first convened a working group to

54
00:02:55.971 --> 00:02:59.980
talk about JavaScript said, it sounds like a skin disease, but it gave.

55
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.720
<v 0>Uh, I mean, maybe you'll speak to that,</v>

56
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:04.330
but it gave the name to JavaScript of ECMAScript.

57
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.370
<v 1>That was the standard name because Java was a trademark of sons.</v>

58
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.300
They were so aggressive.

59
00:03:09.301 --> 00:03:13.620
They were sending cease and desist letters to people whose middle European

60
00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:17.430
heritage meant their PR their surname was vanco and they called their website,

61
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.250
junko.com and someone sent them a letter, say,

62
00:03:20.251 --> 00:03:23.280
you're using JVA at the start of your, the main name. You must cease and desist.

63
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.130
<v 0>I love marketing more than anything else in this world. Uh, so, so ECMAScript,</v>

64
00:03:29.131 --> 00:03:32.880
and now it was popularly named as E S plus version.

65
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.720
<v 1>I would say people use jazz more than anything. People still say JavaScript,</v>

66
00:03:36.721 --> 00:03:38.010
JavaScript and all the books.

67
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.470
<v 0>I mean, when you're referring to it's usually JavaScript.</v>

68
00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:42.900
And when you want to refer to a version of JavaScript,

69
00:03:42.901 --> 00:03:44.850
you'll say [inaudible] yeah.

70
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.440
<v 1>Yes. Or now they've gone two years,</v>

71
00:03:46.441 --> 00:03:50.730
which is kind of confusing because it's an offset of 2009

72
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.660
[inaudible] yes. 2016.

73
00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.030
<v 0>Yeah. It doesn't match the years that year. Yeah. Yeah. So, so what, uh, what,</v>

74
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.820
what were the choices made and how did JavaScript evolve.

75
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.080
<v 1>Here? So we, we took this to this new standards body who, which had,</v>

76
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.980
we thought a, sort of a proven record of standing up to Microsoft,

77
00:04:10.981 --> 00:04:13.860
but Microsoft sent a lot of people. They sent some,

78
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.110
some people who were pretty good.

79
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.530
And then when they realized that I was there and Netscape was not going to,

80
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.720
you know, just bend over and do whatever they wanted,

81
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.460
they sent somebody really good. And he was smart guy.

82
00:04:23.461 --> 00:04:26.520
He did a lot of the work on the first draft of the spec. Uh,

83
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.840
Sean Katzenberg he's left Microsoft. He even did what I sort of did.

84
00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:34.500
He told his bosses, I stopped bugging me to do other things I'm focused on this.

85
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.470
Cause it took a lot of focused work to create the first draft of the spec.

86
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.710
And I was still holding. I was spending almost all the plates I had,

87
00:04:40.711 --> 00:04:44.280
like part-time help in certain areas. And on the front end integrations,

88
00:04:44.281 --> 00:04:45.240
I had the front end guys,

89
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.230
but I couldn't take as much time as Sean was to write the draft spec,

90
00:04:49.231 --> 00:04:52.890
but I had to participate because I was essentially helping write down what the

91
00:04:52.891 --> 00:04:56.910
language did and in areas where we didn't like what it did and Microsoft didn't

92
00:04:56.911 --> 00:05:00.060
agree, we sometimes got away with slight changes.

93
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.380
And that's the story of standards.

94
00:05:01.381 --> 00:05:05.040
You have different implementations and depending on their market power,

95
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.280
they inter operate where you have agreement and where they don't,

96
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.100
the dominant one usually sets the defacto standard.

97
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.370
And then you should probably reflect that into the jury standard.

98
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.590
And this happened with JavaScript, uh,

99
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.170
over time as Netscape went down and Microsoft went up,

100
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.330
we did the first edition to the standards, um, codified in 1997 in France.

101
00:05:24.331 --> 00:05:27.300
We had a trip to niece, uh, which was very memorable.

102
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.000
<v 0>For any interesting reason or just because it's nice.</v>

103
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.530
<v 1>And, and that most European and IBM and others were, you know, there, uh,</v>

104
00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:38.390
my collage on IBM fellow was a British or, and we, the,

105
00:05:38.391 --> 00:05:41.730
the guy who ran ECMO at the time of Yon venom belt was quite, uh,

106
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.200
a rack on tour on a very fun guy. And he had his house for, you know, the great,

107
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.380
you know, freedom air, the blue bays and this.

108
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.070
<v 0>Standardization process beautiful or painful that, uh,</v>

109
00:05:52.071 --> 00:05:53.760
those early days you as a designer.

110
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.680
<v 1>Well, it was painful because it was rushed.</v>

111
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.180
Now guys steel was contributed by sun. So even more than Sean,

112
00:05:59.181 --> 00:06:02.750
you had this giant brain guy steel, helping bringing some of that ski magic.

113
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:05.000
And he even brought Richard Gabriel for funding.

114
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.300
Richard wrote the fourth clause of the standard,

115
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.520
which was kind of an intro to what JavaScript's all about.

116
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.660
So we had some really good people and we didn't fight too much.

117
00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:18.290
There was some tension where I was fixing bugs and I was late to a meeting.

118
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:21.170
And Sean Katzenberg at Microsoft was actually Matt, like, where is he?

119
00:06:21.171 --> 00:06:23.480
We need him. And when I got there,

120
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.490
I saw that only he saw this sort of off by one bug in somewhere in the spec.

121
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:30.830
And then I saw it too. And I said, there's a fence post bug there.

122
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:34.280
And then we kind of locked eyes and we realized we were on the same page and we

123
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:35.600
kind of, he wasn't mad anymore.

124
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.310
<v 0>What were the features that are being like struggled over then debated and</v>

125
00:06:39.311 --> 00:06:40.150
thought about? And.

126
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.360
<v 1>It was mainly writing down what worked and what we thought should work in the</v>

127
00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:47.080
edge cases that didn't inter operate or that seemed wrong. Uh,

128
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.560
but we were already laying the groundwork for the future additions that I was

129
00:06:50.561 --> 00:06:51.460
already implementing.

130
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:56.110
I was still trying to lead the standard by using the dominant market power to

131
00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.790
write the code that actually shipped.

132
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.310
So the de facto standard would lead the design standard.

133
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.010
And I was putting in the, the missing, you know,

134
00:07:03.011 --> 00:07:05.830
function forms that I didn't have time for in the 10 days.

135
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.070
<v 0>So this is the engineering mindset versus the theoretician.</v>

136
00:07:09.071 --> 00:07:10.690
So you didn't want to create the perfect language,

137
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.420
but one that was the popular and shipped and all that kind of stuff.

138
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.520
<v 1>There was, I was standing on the shoulders of giants.</v>

139
00:07:15.521 --> 00:07:19.480
So there was a staged process where I had the whole back things that were well

140
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:22.540
designed by others in other languages I could imitate,

141
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.100
but I couldn't do them all in the 10 days.

142
00:07:24.101 --> 00:07:28.000
So they came in in 1996 in 97,

143
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.700
and they came into the third edition to the standard,

144
00:07:30.701 --> 00:07:34.000
which was finally finalized in 1999. But at that point,

145
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:38.680
Netscape had been sold to AOL and was, which was a decent exit considering.

146
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.440
And, uh, you know, had previously been, uh,

147
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:46.090
mercilessly crushed Netscape was selling the browser along with server software

148
00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:50.080
that it had acquired after its IPO and Microsoft was just underpricing it.

149
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:55.030
So there was no way to compete with that. Microsoft was also, you know,

150
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.360
making internet Explorer, the default browser in windows,

151
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.700
which is called tying in antitrust law.

152
00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:04.810
And they were doing even more brutal things. There's a famous, uh, investor.

153
00:08:04.811 --> 00:08:05.890
He did very well on Google.

154
00:08:05.891 --> 00:08:09.940
So he's a billionaire rom Shriram and he was sales guy or head of sales at Aetna

155
00:08:09.941 --> 00:08:10.774
escaping.

156
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:15.040
He got off the phone looking ashen faced after combat called and said,

157
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.110
uh, Microsoft just told us,

158
00:08:17.111 --> 00:08:20.050
they're going to pull our windows license if we shipped Netscape as the default

159
00:08:20.051 --> 00:08:20.620
browser.

160
00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.020
<v 0>Wow, this is so there is some bullying going on.</v>

161
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:25.510
<v 1>Material in the infantry. Okay. But,</v>

162
00:08:25.511 --> 00:08:29.770
but JavaScript escaped into the standard setting where there was fairly good

163
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.490
cooperation. Microsoft had a really good guy on it and, you know,

164
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.100
guy steel was there for a time and there was some good work,

165
00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:40.300
but after the antitrust case and, you know,

166
00:08:40.301 --> 00:08:44.500
Netscape kind of dissolving into AOL and not really going anywhere quickly,

167
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:48.940
Mozilla took years to really bring up, um, the standard froze.

168
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.350
And by 2003,

169
00:08:50.351 --> 00:08:53.140
even though they'd been sort of noodling around with advanced versions

170
00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:56.910
JavaScript too, I I'd given the, to the kingdom to another MIT grad,

171
00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:59.940
Baltimore horror watt, very big brain still at Google.

172
00:08:59.941 --> 00:09:04.710
I think he won the Putnam in 86 and he's very mathematic. Um,

173
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:08.880
he, he, he designed this successor language JavaScript too, but it,

174
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:14.460
it only showed up in mutated form in Microsoft asp.net

175
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.151
server side.

176
00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:19.020
And it didn't last there and it showed up in flash and that's what became action

177
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.063
script three.

178
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.290
<v 0>Action script. Interesting. And then, and then flash was declined.</v>

179
00:09:24.291 --> 00:09:28.160
And so how do we arrive at ESX where it's, it's like,

180
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.770
there's so many where everyone, okay,

181
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:34.790
there's this history of JavaScript that people were, it was just like, cool.

182
00:09:34.791 --> 00:09:37.820
When you're like having beers to talk crap about JavaScript.

183
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.030
Everyone loves to hate like people who are married say, ah,

184
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.390
marriage sucks is they just want to get, let off some steam,

185
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:49.280
even though everyone uses the language, but ESX EV it's become this like,

186
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:55.040
uh, reputable, like it fixed major pain points. I think it added.

187
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.150
<v 1>Things, the language. And I had something that was already IES five strict mode,</v>

188
00:09:59.151 --> 00:10:03.980
but made it implicit in class bodies and module bodies. It was a big jump,

189
00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:07.970
but it accumulated some of the IES four designs that we'd done with

190
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:09.201
Adobe,

191
00:10:09.201 --> 00:10:13.730
for what we hoped would be the fourth edition of ECMAScript that were

192
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:17.420
supposed to fold in some of these old JavaScript two ideas that had come into

193
00:10:17.421 --> 00:10:18.410
actions for three.

194
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:23.390
So you look at the family tree and you see these forks and the main ones are the

195
00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:27.260
ones that go into Adobe flash acquired from media.

196
00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.440
And the one that went into the service side of Microsoft's stack,

197
00:10:30.441 --> 00:10:32.300
which kind of died, um,

198
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:35.810
and then trying to bring them back into the standard and not quite succeeding,

199
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:37.430
IES four was mothballed,

200
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:41.830
but all the good parts that everyone liked made it in ESX. And so that,

201
00:10:41.831 --> 00:10:43.910
that was a success. And I, I said earlier, I had the wrong year.

202
00:10:43.911 --> 00:10:48.140
I think it's 2015. So it's off by four E S yeah,

203
00:10:48.141 --> 00:10:52.220
it was done finalized in 2015. It took a little longer than we hoped. But, um,

204
00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.080
cause he has five was 2009 and that was a smaller increment from IES three.

205
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.861
We skipped four again,

206
00:10:57.861 --> 00:11:01.850
we mothballed and we had a split in the committee where some people said,

207
00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.910
you know, PS4 is too big. We're going to work on incremental improvements,

208
00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:09.950
no new syntax in particular, they, they promised not quite true, but, uh, they,

209
00:11:09.951 --> 00:11:11.870
they, they added a bunch of interesting API APIs,

210
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.570
Alan where's Brock my coauthor of the hobbled paper.

211
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.870
And he was at Microsoft at the time I ended up hiring Mozilla.

212
00:11:17.871 --> 00:11:22.520
He wanted to get the Mozilla in and keep doing the sort of

213
00:11:22.521 --> 00:11:26.300
editoring entered the job of the JavaScript standard ECMAScript. Um,

214
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.150
and when we got ESX done, it was,

215
00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.750
it was a little late 2015 and we switched to year numbers.

216
00:11:32.751 --> 00:11:36.650
So people still call it ESX. I call it ESX. But if you remember, you know,

217
00:11:36.651 --> 00:11:38.480
off by nine plus 2000.
