00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.840
<v 0>I have to ask you hardware engineer working on your own networks.</v>

2
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:11.130
Now what's consciousness. What the hell is that thing? Is that,

3
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.450
is that just some little weird quirk of our particular, uh,

4
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.380
competing device or is it something fundamental that we really need to crack

5
00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:23.730
open it for to, to, uh, build like good computers?

6
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.300
Do you ever think about consciousness? Like why? It feels like something?

7
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.700
<v 1>I know it's, it's, it's really weird. So yeah.</v>

8
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.700
I mean, everything about it's weird first is to half a second behind reality,

9
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.090
right? It's a post-hoc narrative about what happened.

10
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.710
You've already done stuff by the time you're conscious of it.

11
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.980
And your consciousness generally is a single-threaded thing,

12
00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:52.880
but we know your brain is 10 billion neurons running some crazy

13
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.550
parallel thing. And there's a really big sorting thing going on there.

14
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.610
It also seems to be really reflective in the sense that

15
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.310
you create a space in your head. Like, like we don't really see anything, right?

16
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.320
Like photons hit your eyes.

17
00:01:09.321 --> 00:01:12.560
It gets turned into signals that goes through multiple layers, the neurons,

18
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.860
you know, like I'm so curious, the, you know,

19
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.470
that looks glassy and that looks not glassy. And like,

20
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.230
like how the resolution of your vision is so high,

21
00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:25.040
you have to go through all this processing where for most of it,

22
00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:27.680
it looks nothing like vision, like,

23
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.850
like there's no theater in your mind. Right? So we,

24
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.370
we have a world in our heads.

25
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.870
We're literally just isolated behind our sensors,

26
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.280
but we can look at it, speculate about it,

27
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.990
speculated about alternatives, problem solve. What if, you know,

28
00:01:47.991 --> 00:01:52.520
there's so many things going on and that process is lagging

29
00:01:52.521 --> 00:01:53.354
reality.

30
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.280
<v 0>And it's single threaded,</v>

31
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.070
even though the underlying thing is like massively parallel.

32
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.270
<v 1>So it's, it's so curious. So imagine you're building an AI computer.</v>

33
00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:06.110
If you wanted to replicate humans while you'd have huge rays of neural networks

34
00:02:06.111 --> 00:02:09.440
and apparently only six or seven deep, which Claris,

35
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.070
they don't even remember seven numbers. So I think we can upgrade that a lot.

36
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.001
Right.

37
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:18.500
And then somewhere in there you would train the network to create basically the

38
00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:20.600
world that you live in. Right.

39
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.290
<v 0>So T tell stories to itself about the world that has proceeding.</v>

40
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.600
<v 1>Well, create this great, the world,</v>

41
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.250
tell stories in the world and then have many dimensions of,

42
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.010
you know, like side to it. Like we have an emotional structure,

43
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.760
like we have a biological structure, and that seems hierarchical too. Like,

44
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.370
like if you're hungry, dominate your thinking,

45
00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:45.980
if you're mad at dominates your thinking like,

46
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.040
and we don't know if that's important to consciousness or not,

47
00:02:49.041 --> 00:02:52.640
but it certainly disrupts, you know, intrudes in the consciousness.

48
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.620
So there's lots of structure to that. And we'd like to dwell on the past,

49
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.000
we like to think about the future. We like to imagine we'd like to fantasize,

50
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:02.470
right?

51
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.420
And the somewhat circular observation of that is the thing we call

52
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:11.920
consciousness. Now, if you created a computer system that did all things great,

53
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.310
worldviews creates a future alternative histories, you know,

54
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.780
dwelled on past events, you know, accurately or semi accurately, you know?

55
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.100
<v 0>Well, cautiousness just spring up, like natural.</v>

56
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.980
<v 1>How would that feel? Look and feel conscious to you. Like,</v>

57
00:03:25.981 --> 00:03:28.350
do you see off just to be external observer?

58
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.960
<v 0>Do you think the thing that looks cautious is cautious? Like, do you, uh,</v>

59
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.420
again, this is like an engineering kind of question, I think because, uh,

60
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.490
like if we want to engineer consciousness,

61
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.230
is it okay to engineer something that just looks cautious or is a,

62
00:03:49.231 --> 00:03:50.400
is there a difference between.

63
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.390
<v 1>Consciousness because it's a super effective way to manage our affairs?</v>

64
00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.570
Well, it gives us the planning system. You know, we have a huge amount of stuff.

65
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.070
Like when we're talking,

66
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.100
like the reason that we can talk really fast as we're modeling each other a

67
00:04:05.101 --> 00:04:09.450
really high level detail, cautiousness is required for that. Right. And well,

68
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.190
all of those components together manifest consciousness, right?

69
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.910
So if we make intelligent beings that we want to interact with that, we're like,

70
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.540
you know, wondering what they're thinking, you know, you know,

71
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.180
looking for the scene, um, you know, when they interact with them, they,

72
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.860
they're interesting, surprising, you know, fascinating, you know,

73
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.590
they will probably be, feel conscious like we do. And we'll,

74
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.850
we'll perceive them as conscious.

75
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.480
<v 0>I don't know why not, but you never know.</v>
