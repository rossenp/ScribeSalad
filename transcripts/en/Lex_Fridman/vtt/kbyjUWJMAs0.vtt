00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.380
<v 0>In 2014, I watched this video four years ago, uh,</v>

2
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.620
of you competing in,

3
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.140
I believe your first swim meet against your brother, Terry.

4
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.860
Uh, and you came out victorious.

5
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.753
<v 1>Not really.</v>

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.060
<v 0>Okay. So let's I won the.</v>

7
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.810
<v 1>Did you cheat? He here's what happened?</v>

8
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.690
I had researched this thing because I'm, that's how I am you practiced? No,

9
00:00:29.691 --> 00:00:34.290
I didn't, but I researched it in swimming. If you flinch on that starter block,

10
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.330
mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, it's a false start. You can't Twitch a finger.

11
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.570
And because they would be doing that to get their buddy to move or the guy next

12
00:00:41.571 --> 00:00:46.400
to 'em, you know, so you have to be rock solid. Well, when we went,

13
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.920
Terry was leaning forward as the gun was going off, so he's moving.

14
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.240
And so I was like, no, no, no fall star. No, no, no, no.

15
00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:55.760
And he couldn't hear me. He was already in the water.

16
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.160
And so he took off like a bat outta, you know,

17
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.760
where &lt;laugh&gt; for the end of the pool and couldn't hear me and got to the end of

18
00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:04.630
the pool. And it was a down and back. Well,

19
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.950
that's a hard thing to do with a guy with no body fat. Yeah.

20
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.030
And so he burned a lot of energy. Ah,

21
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.070
and he come up on that end of the pool and he was like, where's, where's he at?

22
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.023
Cause he didn't see me.

23
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.830
And so we stopped him and then he came back and then we went another one and I

24
00:01:17.831 --> 00:01:22.150
beat him. Um, but it's the only time that, you know,

25
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.540
I would say that he was tuckered out and that it's a reason why. And um,

26
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.380
I'll also say this. We did a time where we timed my race,

27
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.193
the one I won

28
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.580
and then we timed his first down to the wall and then we timed his,

29
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.020
the actual race where once he hit the wall, we timed him on the way back.

30
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.650
And he'd beaten me now. How's that for being out? That's pretty honest.

31
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.970
<v 0>That's pretty honest.</v>

32
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.290
<v 1>Accountable. Wow person.</v>

33
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.290
&lt;laugh&gt; and I'm gonna tell you something else getting in those shorts,

34
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.250
those swim trucks. That's impressive.

35
00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.650
<v 0>They are tight. Yeah. So is there &lt;laugh&gt; is outside of wrestling,</v>

36
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.250
is there, uh, a thing that Terry got the better of you? I mean,

37
00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:08.040
I guess the could count as one, uh,

38
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.240
that you're still really bitter about that you need to avenge.

39
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.120
<v 1>I mean, that's passed. I mean, we he's got an UNO title.</v>

40
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.880
We have UNO world championships. He's got an UNO title. I have,

41
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.200
I have yet to have one. Morningstar has two titles. That's unprecedented.

42
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.270
&lt;laugh&gt; so there's only four trophies out. Aaron.

43
00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:27.830
Terry's got one of those and I don't have one.

44
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.590
<v 0>Yet. Yeah. It's still time, Tom.</v>

45
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.830
Thank you so much for letting a Russian with a tie into your home.
