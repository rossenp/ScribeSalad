00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.880
<v 0>Just as a small tangent, uh, your master's thesis is also fascinating. Um,</v>

2
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.160
maybe we could talk about it for just a little bit it's, uh,

3
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.760
titled influence of a Star's evolution on this planetary system.

4
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.840
So this interplay between a star and a planet,

5
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.280
is there something interesting you could say about what you've learned about

6
00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:24.430
this, this journey that, uh,

7
00:00:24.431 --> 00:00:26.590
star takes and the planets around it?

8
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.991
<v 1>Well, it,</v>

9
00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:32.270
when I was younger and I was told what would happen ultimately to the earth,

10
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.230
as the sun expands towards a red giant, and, you know,

11
00:00:37.231 --> 00:00:41.310
mercury would just like fall in and then, you know,

12
00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:45.780
Venus fall in and the son doesn't care and it just seemed

13
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.180
so I felt so small.

14
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.060
I felt like the earth and everything on it. It's just the universe doesn't care.

15
00:00:55.061 --> 00:00:57.500
Even our son doesn't care. And I think,

16
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.980
I felt like our son should feel some sort of responsibility for its planets,

17
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.970
you know? Yes. Yeah. And it just felt like such a island and neglectful parent.

18
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.970
<v 0>It's like a parent eating its own children.</v>

19
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.370
<v 1>It's horrible. It's just a horrible notion. Uh,</v>

20
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:15.610
but it made me think what if this there's some sort of generation.

21
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.930
And so at the time when I was doing my masters,

22
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.650
there was a notion of the white dwarf cemetery,

23
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.290
which is this idea that when stars become white dwarfs that death,

24
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.283
this so horrible,

25
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.960
that planets potentially habitable planets that could have been habitable before

26
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.880
they're now gone. There's no, there's no chance for life. But then I thought,

27
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.960
what if life returns? You know, now it's a white dwarf. It's calmed down.

28
00:01:38.961 --> 00:01:40.520
It's not gonna go anywhere. White dwarfs,

29
00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:44.040
very stable across like universal time scales.

30
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.670
And so could you have planets around a white dwarf that could themselves

31
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.830
get life again? Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know, um, life doesn't care.

32
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.590
And so my work was basically killing

33
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.030
dozens of planets. Thousands of times,

34
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.550
I just ran thousands and thousands of end body simulations. Oh,

35
00:02:03.551 --> 00:02:06.300
you simulated this. Yeah. So I simulated dark, wow.

36
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.300
Growing and just eating all these planets up and just absolute chaos. Um,

37
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.820
the orbits of the planets would change as the star loses mass.

38
00:02:14.821 --> 00:02:17.020
So you would have like Jupiter planet,

39
00:02:17.021 --> 00:02:19.340
like planets just crashing into the other planets,

40
00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:21.500
throwing them into the sun early. It was

41
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.570
terrifying to watch these simulations. It was, um,

42
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.690
absolute carnage. But if you run thousands of these simulations,

43
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.890
some systems find new balance ways of staying alive. Some,

44
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.610
uh, systems post star death find stable orbits again

45
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.570
for billions of years, more than enough for life to originate again.

46
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.600
And so that was my idea. During that time,

47
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.240
that pieces was trying to explore

48
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.040
this notion of life coming back.

49
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.360
And this idea of the universe doesn't care if you're here or not,

50
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.840
and it will go about its business, you know,

51
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.680
Andrada will crash into us and doesn't care.

52
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.440
No one cares if you're alive in the universe.

53
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.120
And so letting go of that preciousness of life,

54
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.160
I found very useful at that stage of my career. And instead, I just thought,

55
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.470
what of, if life is inevitable,

56
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.790
it doesn't matter that it came by 4 billion years ago.

57
00:03:23.791 --> 00:03:28.670
It can start again 4 billion years later. And maybe that is nice.

58
00:03:28.671 --> 00:03:32.750
Maybe that's where hope lies the Phoenix rising, everywhere,

59
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.550
planet being destroyed and created. And we're here now.

60
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.980
And others will be more or less here-ish billions of years later. So accepting.

61
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.860
<v 0>The cycle of death and life and, uh, yeah.</v>

62
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.580
<v 1>And not taking it personally, not taking it personally,</v>

63
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.700
the son doesn't owe anything. Yeah. It's not a bad parent.

64
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:53.860
It's not a parent at all.

65
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.660
<v 0>Yeah. I look at it.</v>

66
00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.650
The work of Freeman Dyson and seeing how it,

67
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.370
how this universe eventually will just be a bunch of super massive black holes

68
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.930
before they.

69
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.810
<v 1>Also Eva break bunch of tiny black holes too. Yeah, absolutely quiet everyone.</v>

70
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:12.730
All the black holes,

71
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.770
a little too far away from one another to even interact until it's just silence

72
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.200
forever. But until then many,

73
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.560
many cycles of death and destruction and rebirth.

74
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.360
<v 0>And rebirth.</v>
