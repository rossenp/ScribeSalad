1
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.190
<v 0>You've written about and made the case that we should take U of full sightings</v>

2
00:00:07.191 --> 00:00:10.670
more seriously. So that's one of the things that, uh,

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.070
I've been, um, in,

4
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.910
on data with sort of the excitement and the passion

5
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.540
that people have for the possibility of extraterrestrial life

6
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.180
of life, out there in the universe.

7
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.820
I've always felt this excitement of just looking up with the stars and wondering

8
00:00:30.821 --> 00:00:35.820
what the hell's out there. Uh, but there's people that have more like, uh, more,

9
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.500
uh, grounded excitement and passion of actually interacting with, uh,

10
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.810
with aliens on this. Here are it,

11
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.650
what's the case that,

12
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.530
from your perspective for taking these sightings more seriously.

13
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.520
<v 1>The data from the Navy to me seem quite serious.</v>

14
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.320
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I don't pretend that I have the technical abilities to

15
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:02.320
judge it as data,

16
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.110
but there are numerous senators at the very highest of levels.

17
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.630
Former heads of CIA Brennan. I talked to him, did an interview with him.

18
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.030
I asked him what's up with these &lt;laugh&gt; what do you think it is?

19
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:18.870
He basically said that was the single most likely explanation was of alien

20
00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:22.350
origin. Now you don't have to agree with him, but look,

21
00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:26.070
if you know how government works, these senators or Hillary Clinton for that,

22
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.980
or Brandon, they sat down, they were briefed by their smartest people.

23
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.660
And they said, Hey, what's going on here? And everyone around the table,

24
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.980
I believe is telling them,

25
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.660
we don't know mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and that is sociological data.

26
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.340
I take very seriously. I have not seen a debunking of the technical data.

27
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.090
Yes. Which is I would reports and images and radar again, at a technical level.

28
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.490
I, I feel quite uncertain on that turf,

29
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.930
but evaluating of the testimony of witnesses,

30
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.010
it seems to me it's now at a threshold where one ought to take it seriously.

31
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.393
<v 0>Yeah. There's a,</v>

32
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.970
one of the problems with the UFO sightings is that because of people with good

33
00:02:06.971 --> 00:02:09.680
equipment, it don't take it seriously.

34
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.000
It's such a taboo topic that you have just like really

35
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.880
equipment collecting data &lt;laugh&gt;.

36
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.080
And so you have the blurry Bigfoot kind of situation where you have just bad

37
00:02:20.081 --> 00:02:24.480
video and all those kinds of things, as opposed to, um, I mean,

38
00:02:24.481 --> 00:02:28.910
there's a bunch of, uh, people, uh, I low from Harvard,

39
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.110
uh, talking about am Mo it's.

40
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.070
It's just like people with the equipment to do the data

41
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.110
collection don't want to help out.

42
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.430
And that creates a kind of divide where the scientists

43
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.230
ignore that this is happening.

44
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.140
And there's the mass of people who are curious about it.

45
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.220
And then there's the government that's full of secrets.

46
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.620
That's leaking some confusion and it creates distrust

47
00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.361
in the government.

48
00:02:59.361 --> 00:03:04.240
It creates distrust in science and it prevents the scientists from being able

49
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:05.920
to explore some cool topics,

50
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.320
some exciting possibilities that they should be. Be curious, kids like a talks.

51
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.080
<v 1>About, even if it has nothing to do with aliens. Yeah. Whatever the answer is.</v>

52
00:03:16.081 --> 00:03:19.230
It has to be something fascinating. Yeah. We already know things interesting,

53
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.870
but this is fascinating. &lt;laugh&gt; uh, but look that all said, I,

54
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.910
I suspect they're not alien origin and let's, let me tell you my reason,

55
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.790
the people who are all gung ho,

56
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.190
they do a kind of reasoning in reverse or argument from elimination.

57
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.590
They figure out a bunch of things that can't be like,

58
00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:38.510
is it a Russian advanced vehicle? Mm-hmm,

59
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.020
&lt;affirmative&gt; probably pretty good arguments there.

60
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.260
Is it a Chinese advanced vehicle? No.

61
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.420
Is it people like from the Earth's future coming back in time? No.

62
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.020
And they go through a few others, they have some really good,

63
00:03:51.021 --> 00:03:54.020
no arguments then they're like, well, what we've got left is aliens. Yeah.

64
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.620
This argument from elimination, I don't actually find that persuasive.

65
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.490
You can talk yourself into a lot of mistaken ideas that way. Yeah.

66
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.690
The positive evidence that it's aliens is still quite weak.

67
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.970
The positive evidence that it's a puzzle is quite huge.

68
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.490
<v 0>And the, and the, whatever the solution to the puzzle is,</v>

69
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:14.970
it might be fascinating.

70
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.930
<v 1>And it's gonna be so weird or fascinating, or maybe even trivial,</v>

71
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:22.800
but that's weird in its own way that we can't set up

72
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.640
by elimination, all the things that might be able to be. Yeah.

73
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.740
<v 0>And just like you said,</v>

74
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.840
the debunking that I've seen of these kinds of things are

75
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.400
less, um,

76
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.120
explorations and solutions to the puzzle and more a kind of have hearted

77
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.023
dismissal.

78
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.910
<v 1>And are the, as you mentioned to him on your podcast with him,</v>

79
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.310
he's been attacked an awful lot. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

80
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.670
And when I hear the idea carrier attacked, I get very suspicious of the critics.

81
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.910
Uh, if, if he's wrong, like just tell me why. Yeah. Like my ears are open.

82
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.190
I don't have a set view on O Mo Mo you know, I,

83
00:04:59.191 --> 00:05:02.580
I know I can't judge Abby's arguments. He can't convince me in that sense.

84
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.500
I'm too stupid to understand how good his argument may or may not be.

85
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.300
<v 0>And not like you said, ultimately in the argument is, uh,</v>

86
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.940
in the,

87
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.340
in the meeting of that debate is when we've where we find the wisdom like

88
00:05:17.341 --> 00:05:18.174
dismissing it.

89
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.900
That's one of the thing that Charles there's a bunch of people like Nisha,

90
00:05:20.901 --> 00:05:25.610
sometimes this way, I'm Rand is sometimes dismissed this way. Oh, here we go.

91
00:05:25.611 --> 00:05:29.410
Like the, the there's a as opposed to arguing against her ideas,

92
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.290
dismissing it outright. And that, that does, that's not productive at all.

93
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.890
Uh, she may be wrong in a lot of things, but like laying out some arguments,

94
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.040
even if they're basic human arguments, uh that's.

95
00:05:43.041 --> 00:05:45.120
That's where we arrive at the wisdom. I love that.
