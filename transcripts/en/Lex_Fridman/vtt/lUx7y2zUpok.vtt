1
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.110
<v 0>And yeah, I mean,</v>

2
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.550
one of the most depressing lessons I got from 2020 is at almost,

3
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.870
it seems like in my opinion,

4
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.070
that we overlearn the lesson of our success and not of our failures,

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.020
for example,

6
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.830
like we have this narrative in our head that we always have the right person at

7
00:00:20.831 --> 00:00:24.140
the right time during crisis. And in, so some cases, it was true.

8
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.180
We didn't deserve Lincoln. We didn't deserve FDR. We didn't deserve, um,

9
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.060
we didn't deserve a lot of presidents at times of crisis, but then you're like,

10
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.020
okay, George W. Bush nine 11, that was terrible. Um, reconstruction,

11
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.540
Andrew Johnson, awful. Right?

12
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.970
Like we had several periods in our history where the crisis was there.

13
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.090
They, they, they were called and they did not show up. And I really,

14
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.490
it hadn't happened in my lifetime except for nine 11.

15
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.410
And even then you could kind of see that as an opportunity for somebody like

16
00:00:58.411 --> 00:01:01.290
Obama to come in and fix it, but then he didn't do it.

17
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.480
And then Trump didn't do it. And you real lies.

18
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.840
I feel like our politics are most analogous to like the

19
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.640
1910s, like all in terms of the Giled age, in terms of that,

20
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.520
remember there's that long period of presence between, um,

21
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.840
between like Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt. We were like, wait,

22
00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:24.080
like who's president, like mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; or,

23
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.950
or even in even tr was like an exception where you'll have like Calvin cool,

24
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.350
who like silent.

25
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.430
<v 1>Cow. So we're living through that grow Cleveland.</v>

26
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.110
<v 0>That's kind of how I, if I think of us within history,</v>

27
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.870
I feel like we're in one of those times, we're just waiting. It feels.

28
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.670
<v 1>Really important to us right now. Like,</v>

29
00:01:40.671 --> 00:01:43.830
this is the most important moment of history, but it might be the, could just.

30
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.740
<v 0>Be a blip, right. 20 through year blip.</v>

31
00:01:45.741 --> 00:01:50.580
Like when you think about who was president between 1890 and 19 before, I mean,

32
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.260
yeah. Between like 1888 and 1910,

33
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.100
like, nobody really thinks about that period of America, but like,

34
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.100
that was an entire lifetime for people, right? Like what did they,

35
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.260
how did they feel about the country that they were in? That's hilarious.

36
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.850
That's how I kind of think of about where we are now. It's funny to think.

37
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.810
<v 1>I mean, I don't wanna minimize it, but like,</v>

38
00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:13.330
we haven't really gone through a world war II style crisis. So like

39
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.970
say that there is a crisis in like several decades of that level,

40
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.410
right? Existential risks. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; to a large portion of the world,

41
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.280
then what will be remembered is world war II,

42
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.960
maybe a little bit about Vietnam and then whatever that crisis is.

43
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.760
And this whole period that we see as dramatic, even coronavirus, even nine 11,

44
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.680
even nine 11, uh it's like,

45
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.440
cuz you can look at how many people died and all those kinds of things,

46
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.150
all the drama around the war on terror and all those kinds of things you maybe

47
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.310
Obama will be remembered for being the first African American president,

48
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.030
but then like that's about it. That's yeah. That's fascinating to think about,

49
00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.000
oh man, even Trump will be like, oh, okay, cool. He was that guy.

50
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.400
Yeah. Like maybe he be remembered as the first, uh,

51
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.080
celebrity. I mean Reagan was already a governor. Yeah. Right? Yeah. So,

52
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.560
so like the first apolitical celebrity, that was a,

53
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.480
so maybe if there's more celebrities in the future,

54
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.710
they'll say that Trump was the first person and pave the,

55
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.590
the way for celebrities to win. Oh man. Yeah. And uh, yeah,

56
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.230
I still, I still hold that this, this era will probably remembered

57
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.270
the, you know, people say, I talk about Elon way too much,

58
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.670
but &lt;laugh&gt; but the reality is like,

59
00:03:35.671 --> 00:03:38.910
there's not many people that are doing the kind of things he's doing is why I

60
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.540
talk, talk about is I think this era it's not necessarily Elon SpaceX,

61
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.540
but this era will be remembered by the new,

62
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.060
the like of the space exploration of uh,

63
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.380
the commercial of companies getting into space, exploration of space travel.

64
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.113
And perhaps

65
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.610
perhaps like artificial intelligence around social media,

66
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.410
all those kinds of things. This might be remembered for that. But every,

67
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.490
all the political bickering, all of that nonsense that might, we might,

68
00:04:08.491 --> 00:04:09.690
might be very well forgotten.

69
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.090
<v 0>One way to think about it is that the internet is so young. Yeah.</v>

70
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.730
I think about it. That's right. Um, with, so Jeff Jarvis, he's a media scholar.

71
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.960
I respect, he's a, not the only person to say this, but many others have,

72
00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:24.080
which is that, look, this is kind of like the printing press.

73
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.000
There was a whole 30 years war because of the printing press. Yeah.

74
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.280
It took a long time for to sort out.

75
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.880
I think that's where we're at with the internet. Like at a certain level,

76
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.440
it disrupts everything and that's a good thing. It can be very tumultuous.

77
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.430
Um, I never felt like I was living through until coronavirus. Like, you know,

78
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.470
like until we were all locked down, I was like,

79
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.350
I'm living through history like this,

80
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.110
it there's this very overused cliche in DC where every com staffer wants you to

81
00:04:51.111 --> 00:04:53.110
think that what their boss just did is history.

82
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.350
And I've always been like this isn't history, this isn't like stupid bill,

83
00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.910
you know, whatever. But like that was the first time I was like,

84
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.830
this is history like this.

85
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.780
<v 1>Yeah. Right here. Well, I was hoping, uh,</v>

86
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.220
tragedy aside that this,

87
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.980
I wish the primaries happened during coronavirus so that we right.

88
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.580
Because like, then we can see so, okay.

89
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.860
Here's a bunch of people facing crisis and it's an opportunity for leader to

90
00:05:17.861 --> 00:05:22.650
step up. Like I still believe the optimistic view is, uh,

91
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.170
the game theory of like influencers will always be defeated by

92
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.570
actual great leaders. So like maybe the great leaders are rare,

93
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.690
but I think they're sufficiently out there that they will step up,

94
00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:40.450
especially in the moments of crisis mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and coronavirus is,

95
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.320
is obviously a crisis. What are like, you know, mass manufacturer of tests,

96
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.240
uh, all, all kinds of infrastructure building that you could have done in 2020.

97
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.800
There's so many possibilities for just like bold action. It makes me sad.

98
00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:57.753
Uh, none of that,

99
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.440
even just forget actually doing the action advocating for it. Yeah.

100
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.920
Right. Just saying like this, we need, we need to do this. And none of that,

101
00:06:07.921 --> 00:06:10.080
like the speeches that Biden made,

102
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.960
I don't even remember a single speech that Biden made because there's zero bold.

103
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.110
I mean, there strategy was to be quiet and let Donald Trump, uh,

104
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.630
polarize the electorate P polarize, electorate, and hope that results in,

105
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.150
in, uh, them winning, uh,

106
00:06:28.151 --> 00:06:30.470
because of the high unemployment numbers and all those kinds of things,

107
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.630
as opposed to like, let's go big, let's go with a big speech.

108
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.740
Let's you know that, uh, yeah.

109
00:06:38.741 --> 00:06:40.900
It's a lost a lost opportunity in some sense,
