00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.210
<v 0>This is a bunch of people who've been reaching out to me,</v>

2
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.490
trying to get me to write a book, which is ridiculous.

3
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.690
Why there there's people who are brilliant folks like you like

4
00:00:11.691 --> 00:00:15.620
Jordan Peterson that I think have a lot of knowledge to share with the world.

5
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:16.280
Okay.

6
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.140
I think what I feel I can contribute to the world in terms of impact

7
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.220
is to build something. Okay.

8
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.770
Meaning like engineering stuff. Okay.

9
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.550
Like a book I feel to be engineered and I'm not using it loosely.

10
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.980
You have to engineer book. It would not for sure. I,

11
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.220
what I mean is like literally a product with programming and artificial

12
00:00:37.221 --> 00:00:40.820
intelligence. Oh, that's I want to build a company. I want to, because there's,

13
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.240
I have a few ideas that I feel I'm equipped at.

14
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.370
It has to do with your like,

15
00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:50.690
intuition about the way you can build a better world. You individually.

16
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.650
Like what can you add to the world? That's a positive thing. And for me,

17
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.990
I feel like the maximum thing I can add to the world is at least to

18
00:00:59.991 --> 00:01:04.520
attempt to build products that would add more love in the world.

19
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.060
And like, so I want to focus on that, the danger of the book for me,

20
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.130
or any kind of writing,

21
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.970
and even this podcast is a little bit dangerous for me is like,

22
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.130
it's fun for sure. It's, it's, it's fun.

23
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.581
It's like,

24
00:01:19.581 --> 00:01:22.430
it takes you into this place where you start thinking about the world,

25
00:01:22.431 --> 00:01:25.810
you start enjoying and playing with ideas. You start and like,

26
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.900
I just your book on, um, dear reader, uh,

27
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.430
but also the new, right?

28
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.770
Like clearly you're not probably think similarly in the sense that you

29
00:01:36.771 --> 00:01:41.300
did a lot of work. Yes. This next book is killing me. Yeah.

30
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.200
As you mentioned, often, it's clear like, uh,

31
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.210
on your YouTube channel, which I'm a fan of you often, it just comes out.

32
00:01:50.211 --> 00:01:52.970
Like you mentioned all of these books that you're reading,

33
00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:57.080
it just comes through you that you're suffering through this and you've,

34
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.490
it changes you.

35
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.890
And it's clearer that you're thinking deeply about the world because of

36
00:02:03.891 --> 00:02:07.520
this book. And I feel like if you do that, that's like, uh,

37
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.190
when I was, when I first came to this country,

38
00:02:10.191 --> 00:02:14.330
I read the book to give her it and to read it again. It's like it, uh,

39
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.190
the red pill thing is it changes you in where you can never be the

40
00:02:19.191 --> 00:02:22.760
same person. Again, I feel, I feel about a book in that same way.

41
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.420
The moment you write a book, the domain, of course, it depends on the book.

42
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.250
I could also just write, uh, like in my field, a very technical book.

43
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.810
No, that's terrible idea. Yes. But that that's okay. That doesn't really change.

44
00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:39.350
You that's just like sharing information, but like something where you're like,

45
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.520
how do I think about this world? Can you just leave that behind you? I get it.

46
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.720
It's it's it's being pregnant. There's it never escapes your brain.

47
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.340
I'm telling you. You're absolutely right.
