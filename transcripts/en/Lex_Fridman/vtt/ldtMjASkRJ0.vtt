00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.280
<v 0>You know, can we actually, I mean,</v>

2
00:00:04.281 --> 00:00:08.000
I think you're asking me that question that con basically was trying to get at

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.150
was can we know the thing in itself? Can we know that?

4
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.410
Can we have like some kind of like intense knowing of it,

5
00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:17.150
it's almost mystical. Um,

6
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.950
and I would say that that's where religion comes in.

7
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.170
Okay. That's where we talk about religion. Um,

8
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.710
and if I may also go back to Emmanuel Kant,

9
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.600
this idea that he just, before he died, just as he died,

10
00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:33.560
he was working on,

11
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.600
he did this critique of reason where basically he believed he, he basically,

12
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.580
um, talks about, can we know what's real and he basically has this long,

13
00:00:43.581 --> 00:00:47.180
you know, the question can we know it's real? And then, you know,

14
00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:49.370
a thousand pages later? No.

15
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.440
<v 1>I'll just give.</v>

16
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.220
<v 0>You the rundown. Okay. So, okay. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Um,</v>

17
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.800
then he does this other, uh, critique and, um, okay.

18
00:00:57.801 --> 00:01:01.940
So he does like three critiques, then he does this critique of judgment. Okay.

19
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.250
Well, judgment is this other thing altogether.

20
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.790
And I think that that's what you're getting at. So how do we know things?

21
00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:10.970
How can we know things really intensely and intimately?

22
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.680
And I think that he thought that judgment was the idea that we can

23
00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:19.010
actually, um, no, the thing in itself.

24
00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:22.940
And he was working on that as he died and then he never finished it haunted or

25
00:01:22.941 --> 00:01:27.080
rent. Uh, another philosopher of the 20th century took it up,

26
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.200
took up the critique of judgment and tried to finish it.

27
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.630
<v 1>Oh, why the word judgment.</v>

28
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.880
<v 0>Because judgment think about it when you see a work of art who judges that to</v>

29
00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:41.630
be decent. Okay. So there's a, there is, um,

30
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.160
a group of people who come to the decision that that's rotten

31
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.700
or, you know, that's pretty good, you know, like, um,

32
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.950
I noticed that you'd like to play guitar. Well,

33
00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:54.740
you choose music that I happen to like too. Okay.

34
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.450
So you and I both have a sense of judgment. This is sense. Yeah. So he said,

35
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.310
there's a sense that some people have,

36
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.860
why do certain communities have a similar sense? What,

37
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.230
what dictates that? And so he was working on that.

38
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.230
He said he thought it had something to do with the knowledge,

39
00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:16.190
the intimate knowledge of the thing in itself. Um, yeah. So, uh,

40
00:02:16.191 --> 00:02:19.790
another philosopher that philosophers actually don't like at all,

41
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.350
but religious studies people do is Martin Heidegger. So Martin Heidegger, um,

42
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.430
has some great essays. One is called what is a work of art. And again,

43
00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:32.030
he gets to, you know, he talks about van Gogh and van Gogh's shoes. You know,

44
00:02:32.031 --> 00:02:34.460
that picture, the painting van Gogh's shoes.

45
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.770
It's really a really intense picture. It's just shoes. It's, you know,

46
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.080
it's, it's, it's an amazing painting of shoes. And I think everybody can agree.

47
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.390
That's a cool picture of shoes. Right. And so, Y you know, the question is,

48
00:02:50.391 --> 00:02:52.490
why is that a cool picture of shoes? You know,

49
00:02:52.491 --> 00:02:57.260
what kind of knowledge are we accessing to determine that indeed,

50
00:02:57.261 --> 00:03:01.150
that, that works right? And fact, we still like it. So basically.

51
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.090
<v 2>The nature of knowledge and what does it represent?</v>

52
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.600
It can operate in the space of those detached from reality,

53
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.460
or can it ultimately represent reality? I guess that's the,

54
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.610
that's the space of metaphysics. Is that the.

55
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.240
<v 0>Um, yeah. So what can we know is actually called a homology, but metaphysics is,</v>

56
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.750
is basically what is the nature of reality.

57
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.520
<v 2>Right. And those intersect.</v>

58
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.940
<v 0>Absolutely. Yeah. A lot of things intersect in philosophy.</v>

59
00:03:29.941 --> 00:03:31.650
We just have fancy names for them.
