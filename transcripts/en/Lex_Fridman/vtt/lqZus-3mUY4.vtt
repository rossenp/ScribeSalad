1
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.030
<v 1>Yeah. Okay. So Hannah Rand,</v>

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.750
she is a philosopher that not a lot of people know about,

3
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.300
but she's a Jewish woman during the Holocaust.

4
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.100
And she was intern intern at Bergen Belsen, which was,

5
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.820
uh, basically Auschwitz for women. And she escaped,

6
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.420
she came to the United States and she had worked with Heidecker,

7
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.650
even though he's supposed to be antisemitic and Nazi and everything,

8
00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:29.360
but they were lovers. Okay.

9
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.080
So she comes out and she she's at Columbia university and she teaches philosophy

10
00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:37.250
there. And, um, she writes this, she writes two books, which I'll recommend.

11
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.160
One is called Eichmann in Jerusalem, where she attended,

12
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.020
attends the Nuremberg trials.

13
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.210
And she basically makes this really a Stu observation about evil. And she says,

14
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.810
I come in is one of the people who sent the Jews to the concentration camps who

15
00:00:50.811 --> 00:00:53.720
ran the trains. Okay. Um, and she said,

16
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.940
the thing about Eichmann was that he didn't seem particularly evil.

17
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.540
Actually. He seemed to be quite a nice guy. She said,

18
00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:06.830
what was interesting about him was he seemed incredibly thoughtless and stupid.

19
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.040
And she said, and use a lot of stereotypes like memes.

20
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.950
So she actually wrote about memes before we had them.

21
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.310
And now people just use memes and they're actually used against us,

22
00:01:16.311 --> 00:01:20.570
even there's even a segments of warfare called memetic warfare.

23
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.760
Alright. So memes are something that can sway a whole population of people. Um,

24
00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:30.320
so she wrote about memes before they were even in existence and that's Eichmann

25
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:31.154
in Jerusalem.

26
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.940
And I think she also has some really amazing things to say about evil is that,

27
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.480
um, when people remained thoughtless,

28
00:01:38.481 --> 00:01:41.720
she has another book called the life of the mind, which is gigantic.

29
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:44.960
And I don't think anybody will read it, but frankly,

30
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.030
it's one of the best books I've ever read.

31
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.690
And I've read it many times and basically the life of the mind and the life of

32
00:01:50.691 --> 00:01:52.970
the mind, she asks a very simple question. She says,

33
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.170
why do people do bad things? Why are they evil? And what she says,

34
00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.400
she wonders if it's,

35
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.450
she says that bad people sleep well at night contrary to,

36
00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:04.880
you know how the saying, how do you sleep at night? Well,

37
00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:07.520
that's only because you're a good person that you're asking that question

38
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.660
because you actually have a conscience and a conscience is this dual kind of,

39
00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:15.860
you fight with yourself about the consequences of your actions. And she says,

40
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.320
bad people don't seem to have a conscience.

41
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.120
So they actually sleep well at night.

42
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.990
And so she goes through the whole history of philosophy, uh, about evil.

43
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.360
And that's really a good one too, but I have, um,

44
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.430
also have to recommend this one too. There's one more.

45
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.910
So I know I recommended two, but just from the same philosopher, uh,

46
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.570
my friend Jeffrey Kripal, he's at rice university and he's in my fields. Right?

47
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.020
Uh, religious studies, he wrote, he's written several books. I mean,

48
00:02:39.021 --> 00:02:42.590
he's written a heck of a lot of books. Let's put it that way, but he's, um, his,

49
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.280
I think his best book or the one that impacted me the most is called the authors

50
00:02:46.281 --> 00:02:47.270
of the impossible.

51
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.520
And his book is his writing is very much like niches writing in the sense that

52
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.650
he it's almost as if he reaches out of the pages and he grabs you and it kind of

53
00:02:57.651 --> 00:03:01.570
slaps you around and says about this, you know, and you can't help,

54
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.910
but be changed after you've read it.

55
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.550
And he's got a great chapter in there about jock valet.

56
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.261
<v 2>Oh.</v>

57
00:03:07.261 --> 00:03:12.180
So he called us a bunch of different thinkers and authors that are out that

58
00:03:12.181 --> 00:03:14.850
somehow are, what is it?

59
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.640
Renegade in some aspect to revolutionary.

60
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.660
<v 1>Yeah. They're thinking the impossible. Right? There's a great one.</v>

61
00:03:21.661 --> 00:03:25.740
He's written called mutants and mystics. Ray talks about, uh,

62
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.560
the comic strips. Uh, the, um, gosh,

63
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.340
why can't I remember the name of the person he just died. Stan Lee.

64
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.380
He talks about the history of the comics by Stan Lee and they're all paranormal.

65
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.770
They all start off super paranormal. And it's fascinating.

66
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.800
<v 2>Um, on, on the topic of Ana, uh, rent.</v>

67
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.380
Uh, so I haven't read her work,

68
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.150
but I've vaguely touched upon sort of like commentary of

69
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.260
her work.

70
00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.000
And it seems like some people think her work is dangerous in some aspect.

71
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.220
I don't know if you can comment on why that is. I just,

72
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.810
it feels like similar with iron Rand or something like that, where like,

73
00:04:09.811 --> 00:04:12.630
this is a, I should say not dangerous, but controversy.

74
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.600
<v 1>Yes it is. Yeah. They think it's controversial. Um,</v>

75
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.780
this is the reason I believe, um, I've heard of the controversy.

76
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.250
The controversy is that she didn't, I, she, first of all, um,

77
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.080
she is Jewish and she did escape a concentration camp,

78
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.820
and yet she's called, she's been called anti-Jewish.

79
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.870
And I think part of that was that she basically was saying something

80
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.960
that I believe that a lot of normal people are like

81
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.880
Eichmann and evil things are done by people who just follow the

82
00:04:47.881 --> 00:04:50.640
rules and they don't think about what they're doing.

83
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.800
And that's one of the most pernicious forms of evil of our

84
00:04:55.801 --> 00:04:56.340
time.
