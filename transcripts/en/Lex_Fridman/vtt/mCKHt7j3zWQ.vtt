00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:03.921
<v 0>That's interesting.</v>

2
00:00:03.921 --> 00:00:08.000
So that's referring to more that there should be a consistent habit

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.720
versus, uh, the total amount to, to me,

4
00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:15.360
like the entirety of the picture of sleep is, uh,

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.920
it's similar to nutrition in that it feels like it's,

6
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.990
there's so many variables involved and it's so person specific.

7
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.110
<v 2>So, you know, a lot of studies, I mean,</v>

8
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:32.830
this is the way of science has to look in aggregate the effects on sleep.

9
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.550
It doesn't focus on high performers in which are individuals ultimately

10
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.870
like the question isn't. Uh, so it's a very important question is like,

11
00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:47.220
what kind of diet at fights obesity reduces obesity?

12
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:48.660
It's another question.

13
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.620
What kind of diet allows David Goggins to be the best version of himself?

14
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.540
So these high performers in different avenues and the same thing with sleep,

15
00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.740
like people that tell me that actually get eight hours of sleep.

16
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.090
It's like it it's, I, I mean, I,

17
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.290
I get it and they may be right, but they may be very wrong.

18
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.210
<v 1>And there's no evidence that eight is better than six,</v>

19
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.850
that you could very well do better on six than on eight.

20
00:01:16.851 --> 00:01:18.330
There are a few other things that, um,

21
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.370
turn out to be strong parameters for success in this domain, for instance,

22
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.680
your entire life we aching or sleep is broken up into these 90 minute Alterian

23
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.680
cycles. If you look at ability to attend or do math problems or do anything,

24
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.250
you know,

25
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.040
drive performance tends to ramp up slowly within a 90 minute

26
00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:40.000
cycle peak and then come down at the end of that 90 minute cycle.

27
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.200
<v 2>And in sleep, we go through these stage 1, 2, 3, 4 REM, et cetera.</v>

28
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.270
We took more about if you like those on 90 minute Alterian cycles as well,

29
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.670
ending your sleep after a 90 minute cycle at the,

30
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.350
at the near the end of a 90 minute cycle, say at the end of six hours,

31
00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.510
in many cases is better for you than sleeping an additional hours, seven hours,

32
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.350
and waking up in the middle of an Alterian cycle.

33
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.420
<v 1>And there are few apps that can measure this based on body move and things like</v>

34
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:10.900
that, that have you, your alarm go off at the end of an Alterian cycle. Yeah.

35
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.980
And if you wake up in the middle of an Alterian cycle, sometimes not always,

36
00:02:14.981 --> 00:02:17.060
you can be very groggy for a long period of time.

37
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.340
I certainly do better on six hours than I do on seven.

38
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.660
<v 2>I happen to like an eight hour sleep. It feels great,</v>

39
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.650
but I haven't slept an entire eight hour without waking up in the middle of the

40
00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:32.410
night at some point in, I dunno, forever. I, I can't remember.

41
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.450
It's probably some point in infancy, but.
