00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.870
<v 0>How do you know the, what is good?</v>

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.190
<v 1>There's lots of standards of good, but if you are,</v>

3
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.510
for me to be a good guy,

4
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.590
is if you want to leave the world a little bit better than you found it.

5
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.150
That to me is the definition of a good guy.

6
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.230
And I think there are many people that, that that's not their motivation.

7
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.060
<v 0>And also it's about your motivation. Well.</v>

8
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.260
<v 1>It's also about if your motivation is at all, um, correlated to reality.</v>

9
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.340
I, you, no one thinks we're the bad guys that that's correct,

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.500
but are you taking steps to check your motivations and,

11
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.380
and also take certain amount of humility because if you're going to start

12
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.370
interfering other people's lives, you really, uh, better be sure.

13
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.690
You know what you're talking about.

14
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.810
<v 0>The control of others. If you do have centralized control, or then you kind of,</v>

15
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.170
you become a leader of a group,

16
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.970
you better know you better do so humbly and cautiously.

17
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.490
And I.

18
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.320
<v 1>Also have, uh, uh, steam valves. Right? Right.</v>

19
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.720
So if in case things go wrong, let's have,

20
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.320
I'm sure this is a lot happening with AI would ever work with computers. Like,

21
00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:12.600
okay, if something goes wrong here,

22
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.600
how do we have a workaround to make sure it doesn't cause everything to

23
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.950
collapse?

24
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.120
<v 0>Yeah. The, the going wrong thing. I mean the, the whole, the feedback mechanism.</v>

25
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.200
Yeah. Like, uh,

26
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.550
I wonder if people in Congress think that things are

27
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:28.723
really wrong.

28
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.230
<v 1>It's working for them. Are.</v>

29
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.390
<v 0>You, are you sure? Because yeah,</v>

30
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.630
I'm not sure because I I'd like to believe, uh,

31
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.590
that the people that at least when they got into politics actually

32
00:01:42.591 --> 00:01:43.830
wanted some of it is ego,

33
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.860
but some of it like wanting to be the kind of person that builds a

34
00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:49.490
better world.

35
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.780
<v 1>Sure. I also think it's a, it's diverse.</v>

36
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.460
Some who are gonna have different motivations than others.

37
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.100
<v 0>But like once you're in the system and trying to build a better world,</v>

38
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.020
how do you know that it's not working? Like,

39
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.410
how do you take the basic feedback? Make an a and like,

40
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.490
and actually productively change. I mean,

41
00:02:10.491 --> 00:02:13.610
that's what it means to be a good guy is like, Hmm, something is wrong here.

42
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.890
And this that's why I like the ELAM Musk like think from first principles, like,

43
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.330
wait, wait, okay, let's ask the big question. Like,

44
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.490
can this be one, is this working at all?

45
00:02:24.491 --> 00:02:25.970
Like the way we're solving this particular,

46
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.760
the problem of government is this working at all?

47
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.120
And then like stepping away and saying like,

48
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.880
as opposed to modifying this bill or that bill, or like this little strategy,

49
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.880
like increase the tax by this much, or decrease the tax by this much. Like,

50
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.280
why do we have a democracy at all?

51
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.230
Or why do we have any kind of representative democracy?

52
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.910
Shouldn't it be a pure democracy?

53
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.910
Or why do we have states, uh,

54
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.840
like representation of states and federal government, so on, why do we have a,

55
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.720
this kind of separation of power, this different, why,

56
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.960
why don't we have term limits or not like big things?

57
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.440
Like how do you actually make that happen?

58
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.480
And is that what it means to be a good guy is like

59
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.790
taking big revolutionary steps as opposed to income mental.

60
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.750
<v 1>Steps. Well, I,</v>

61
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.150
I don't know that you could be a politician to be a good guy to be analyst.

62
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.430
And let me give you a counter example of someone who you could tell is not being

63
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.110
a good guy. Uh, Joe Biden said he was, he regards the Iraq war mistake. Okay.

64
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.710
You and I have made mistakes in our lives.

65
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.030
I'm sure none of our mistakes have caused tens of thousands of people to die.

66
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.940
Um, if let's was something for yourself, &lt;laugh&gt; I that's fair. Okay.

67
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:43.580
I'll take that. I, I don't build the kill bots. &lt;laugh&gt; um,

68
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.020
if I were a chef, let's take it outta politics.

69
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.220
And in my restaurant somehow accidentally someone ate something and they died

70
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.340
a I would feel horrible, but more importantly, I would be like,

71
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.410
we need to look through this system and figure out how it got to the point where

72
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:05.290
someone lost their life, because that can never happen again.

73
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.970
And we need to figure out step by step it's there's. I, I'm not a gun person,

74
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.850
but there's like this checklist of like, if you're holding a gun,

75
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.530
there's five things to do. And even if you get too wrong, you're gonna be, say,

76
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.410
it's like, assume every gun is loaded.

77
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.520
Only pointed at something that you want to kill.

78
00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.200
And there's like three other things.

79
00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.520
And it's like to make sure that nothing goes wrong.

80
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.360
So if I made a,

81
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.240
if I'm that chef and I would have to not only feel guilt,

82
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.920
but take preventative action to make sure this has no possibility

83
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.950
of happening again. If you look, get the staff he's putting in,

84
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.030
it's the same war Moners that would've advised him to get into the Iraq war

85
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.590
on the first time, that is to me is not a good guy.

86
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.030
That to me is someone who does not feel remorse for their responsibility in

87
00:04:56.031 --> 00:04:59.790
killing not only many Americans, but some of us think that, you know,

88
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.940
dead Iraqis is a necess fairly ideal either.
