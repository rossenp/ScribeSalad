00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.720
<v 0>I don't know how difficult it is to replicate that we're talking offline about,</v>

2
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.360
uh, Boston dynamics, robots. Um, they've recently been,

3
00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:15.960
they did both par core. They did flips. They've also done some dancing

4
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.240
and it's something I think a lot about because what most people don't realize

5
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.830
because they don't look deep enough as those robots are hard coded to do

6
00:00:27.831 --> 00:00:31.550
those things. The, the robots didn't figure it out by themselves.

7
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.150
And yet the,

8
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.750
the fundamental aspect of what it means to be human is that process of figuring

9
00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:38.950
out of making mistakes.

10
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.070
And then there's something about overcoming those challenges and the mistakes,

11
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.660
and like figuring out how to lose yourself in the magic of the dancing, uh,

12
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.860
or just movement is what it means to be human, that learning process.

13
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.300
So that's what I wanna do with the, with the, um,

14
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.140
almost as a fun side thing with the,

15
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.820
the Boston dynamics robots is to have them learn and see what they figure out.

16
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.970
Even if it, even if they make mistakes, I wanna let

17
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.290
spot make mistakes. And in,

18
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:14.730
so during discover what it means to be alive,

19
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.610
discover beauty, because I think that's the essential aspect of mistakes.

20
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.490
Boston dynamics, folks want spot to be perfect.

21
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.880
&lt;laugh&gt; because they don't want spot to ever make mistakes because they wants to

22
00:01:27.881 --> 00:01:32.360
operate in the factories. It wants to be, you know, very safe and so on. For me,

23
00:01:32.361 --> 00:01:33.720
if you construct the environment,

24
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.360
if you construct a safe space for robots and allow them to make mistakes,

25
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.400
something beautiful might be discovered,

26
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.590
but that requires a lot of brain power spot is currently very dumb.

27
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.630
And I'm gonna add, give it a brain. Uh,

28
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.990
so first make it see currently can't see,

29
00:01:51.991 --> 00:01:55.910
meaning computer vision has to understand its environment has to see all the

30
00:01:55.911 --> 00:02:00.350
humans, but then also has to be able to learn, learn about its movement,

31
00:02:00.351 --> 00:02:03.910
learn how to use this body, to communicate with others,

32
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.700
all those kinds of things that do know how to do well.

33
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.740
Humans know how to do somewhat well. Um, I think that's a beautiful challenge,

34
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.260
but first you have to allow the robot to make mistakes.

35
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.220
<v 1>Well, I think, um, your objective is laudable,</v>

36
00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:22.940
but you're gonna realize that the Boston Dyna dynamics folks are right the first

37
00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:25.300
time spot poops on your rug. &lt;laugh&gt;.

38
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.210
<v 0>Um, I hear the same thing about kids and so on. Uh,</v>

39
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.810
but I still want to have kids. No, you.

40
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.370
<v 1>You should. It's, it's, it's a great experience. Um,</v>

41
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.970
so let me step back into what you said in a couple of different places. One,

42
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.090
I've always believed that the missing element in, uh,

43
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.650
robotics and artificial intelligence is a proper development, right?

44
00:02:45.651 --> 00:02:47.120
It is no accident.

45
00:02:47.121 --> 00:02:51.920
It is no mere coincidence that human beings are the most dominant species on

46
00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:52.481
planet earth.

47
00:02:52.481 --> 00:02:57.200
And that we have the longest childhoods of any creature on earth by far, right?

48
00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.640
The development is the key to the flexibility. And so, uh,

49
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.680
the capability of a human at adulthood is the

50
00:03:07.681 --> 00:03:12.480
mirror image. It's the flip side of our helplessness at birth.

51
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.200
Um, so I'll be very interested to see what happens in your, uh, robot project.

52
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.750
If you do not end up, uh, reinventing childhood for robots,

53
00:03:21.751 --> 00:03:25.870
which of course is foreshadowed in 2001, quite brilliantly.
