00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.210
<v 0>Maybe you can talk to the theory of everything. Uh, the,</v>

2
00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:10.090
this attempt in the current set of physical laws to try to unify them.

3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.930
Is there any hope that once, uh,

4
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.730
a theory of everything is developed and by theory of everything, I mean,

5
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.770
in a narrow sense of unifying quantum field area and general relativity,

6
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.840
do you think that will contain in some, like,

7
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.920
in order to do that unification,

8
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.400
you would have to get something that would then give hints about the physics of

9
00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:35.600
life, physics of existence, physics of consciousness.

10
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.640
<v 1>Yeah, I used to not, but I actually, uh,</v>

11
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.440
I have become increasingly convinced that it probably will. Uh,

12
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.110
and part of the reason is, um, I think I've,

13
00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:50.190
I've talked a little bit already about these holes in physics. Like these, the,

14
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.390
the theories we have in physics, you know, they have problems,

15
00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:56.910
they have lots of problems, um, and they're very deep problems. Um,

16
00:00:56.911 --> 00:00:58.870
and we don't know how to patch them. Um,

17
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.990
and some of those problems become very evident when you try to patch, um,

18
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.910
quantum mechanics in general activity together.

19
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.360
<v 2>Um,</v>

20
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.860
so there is this kind of interesting feature that some of the ways of patching

21
00:01:08.861 --> 00:01:13.780
that might actually, um, closely resemble, uh, the physics of life.

22
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.900
And so the place where that actually comes up most.

23
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.620
And actually we just had a workshop, um,

24
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.340
in the beyond center where I work at Arizona state university, um,

25
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.780
and Lee Molin made this point that he thinks that the theory of quantum gravity,

26
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.890
when we solve it is gonna be the same theory that gives rise to life.

27
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.230
<v 1>Um,</v>

28
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.970
and I think that I agree with him on some levels because there's something very

29
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.370
interesting where if you look at these sort of causal set theories of gravity,

30
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.930
where they're looking for space, um,

31
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.090
as being emergent and so space time is an emergent concept from a causal set,

32
00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:46.080
which is, is also so sort of related, I think,

33
00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:48.600
to what Wolf firm's doing with his physics project. Um,

34
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.040
it's the same kind of underlying math that we have in,

35
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.800
in this theory that we've been developing related to life called assembly

36
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.200
theory, um, which is, you know,

37
00:01:56.201 --> 00:02:00.800
basically trying to look at complex objects like molecules and,

38
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.910
um, bacteria and living things as, um, sort of,

39
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.350
uh, as basically being assembled from a, a set of component parts, um,

40
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.150
and that they actually encode all the possible histories that they could have in

41
00:02:15.151 --> 00:02:17.870
that physical object. So the mathematically,

42
00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:19.030
all these ideas I think are related.

43
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.950
I think a lot of people are thinking about this from different perspectives and

44
00:02:21.951 --> 00:02:23.350
then constructive theory, um,

45
00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:26.030
that David DOYs and Kara Marto have been developing is a,

46
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.700
a totally different angle on it. But I think getting at some similar ideas.

47
00:02:28.701 --> 00:02:30.060
So it's a really interesting time right now,

48
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.020
I think for the frontiers of physics and how it's relating, um,

49
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.580
to maybe deeper principles about what life is so short answer. Yes.

50
00:02:36.581 --> 00:02:38.500
Long-winded answer rewind.
