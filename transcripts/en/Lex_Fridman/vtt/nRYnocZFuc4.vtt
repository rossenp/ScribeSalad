00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.620
<v 0>Well, this is my question for you.</v>

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.110
Going back to that crappy bar and people pitching you, is,

3
00:00:08.111 --> 00:00:12.690
is there do like with clubhouse, do you see competitors?

4
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.210
Do you think it's possible that another,

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.710
perhaps more decentralized or another kind of social media will emerge that will

6
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:23.130
take on Twitter and Facebook that might be able to replace someone.

7
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.540
If you look at the whole landscape, uh, with club and everything else,

8
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:30.300
do you think some other company might emerge.

9
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.240
<v 1>There'll be 10 versions of clubhouse.</v>

10
00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:36.620
We looked at social network and we thought Friendster was it like Friendster was

11
00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:39.080
so good. Nobody be able to compete with that. It was growing so quickly.

12
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.740
And then MySpace was a juggernaut and they hit a hundred million in revenue and

13
00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:44.900
a hundred million users. And it was like, well, that's game over.

14
00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:49.730
And then Facebook and LinkedIn and Snapchat and friend feed and countless

15
00:00:49.731 --> 00:00:50.451
others, you know,

16
00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:55.070
so there's usually 20 people who will win in a category and

17
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.490
80% of the category will be owned by the top two or three players.

18
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.600
<v 0>But will those players change? Do you think what's your sense for sure.</v>

19
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.420
<v 1>Or, I mean, if we, if Facebook hadn't bought Instagram,</v>

20
00:01:05.421 --> 00:01:08.090
it would be a company in decline right now people would be shorting the stock,

21
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.380
right. Facebook peaked and then was sort of heading down, um,

22
00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:14.150
and Instagram saved them and WhatsApp saved them. So, you know,

23
00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:17.720
that's another kind of weird moment in history that they were able to accumulate

24
00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:19.850
that much power and consolidate that much power.

25
00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:22.100
Instagram should have never sold to them. That should have gone public.

26
00:01:22.101 --> 00:01:26.360
They had just raised money from Sequoia and they had raised $50 million at a

27
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.760
$500 billion valuation and they didn't need to sell.

28
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.590
And that was a big mistake to sell.

29
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.620
They should have kept going and it should have taken took on Facebook.

30
00:01:33.621 --> 00:01:36.980
And if Instagram was a standalone company, right. And it'd be worth 500 million,

31
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.360
do you think a billion?

32
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.320
<v 0>Yeah. Do you think, uh, Facebook, my bike club house has been a.</v>

33
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.570
<v 1>Oh, they'll probably copy it. I mean, soccer,</v>

34
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.620
Berg has no moral compass or ethics or anything. I mean, he's a Marauder.

35
00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:51.980
I mean, he basically copied Snapchat seven times,

36
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.220
like he did poke and he just kept trying and trying and trying.

37
00:01:55.221 --> 00:01:58.550
And it's part of the reason why the WhatsApp founders and the Instagram founders

38
00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:02.780
left is they found soccer bark. So distasteful in terms of his ability to copy.

39
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.040
<v 0>Like what do you think makes a great leader in that sense? Because, okay.</v>

40
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:11.780
So when I look at Zuckerberg, a great executer, is he a great actor?

41
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.150
I think he's a great leader. I was bullied Sean.

42
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.390
I was excited to buy Facebook in the very early days. Uh,

43
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.330
I thought it was an exciting opportunity to connect people and stuff started

44
00:02:20.331 --> 00:02:24.170
going wrong in certain kinds of ways. And again,

45
00:02:24.171 --> 00:02:28.880
maybe it's our human nature, but I attribute a lot of that to the leadership.

46
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.590
<v 1>Absolutely. I mean,</v>

47
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.820
the guy started it because he was unable to ask girls if they were single and on

48
00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:37.910
a date. I mean, that was his explicit good motivator. That could be a good,

49
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.800
I mean the motivation of 18, 19 year old men. Yeah. Pretty clear.

50
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.560
Um, he was just trying to, he had no game,

51
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.210
no game and he needed to know who was single. So he could, you know,

52
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.130
at least have a shot at getting a little creepy. Yeah. You know, he, he,

53
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.000
I think was so obsessed with engagement and winning and he's, he's kind of,

54
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.960
one of those friends you have was just really good at playing a video game,

55
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.230
but maybe doesn't see the bigger picture in life. And um, I mean,

56
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:08.350
there's a reason why everybody who worked for him hates him and doesn't talk to

57
00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:10.900
him anymore and then actively drives him. Like there's so many,

58
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.940
just the people who sold WhatsApp to him then backed other

59
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.000
projects like telegram and said horrible things about him on the way out.

60
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.400
These are the people who made billionaires. Um, and they're,

61
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.140
they really don't like him. Uh,

62
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.400
so I think there is something that he does that does not breed loyalty. Uh,

63
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.290
but he's very successful in his focus, which is growth is all that matters.

64
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.680
He's a Marauder and taking friction out of products and processes is the

65
00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:38.790
playbook of Silicon Valley for the last decade or two. So whatever.

66
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.790
<v 0>If that's actually true, what you're saying right outside,</v>

67
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.280
you speak so fast that I almost forget that you're, you're dropping bombs,

68
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.760
but so removing the removing friction,

69
00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:49.350
and you're saying Facebook is exceptionally good.

70
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.950
<v 1>He was the best at it. I mean, at Uber, they were like,</v>

71
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.720
we're going to take out tipping.

72
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.080
We're going to take out the need for you to take out your credit card and do

73
00:03:58.081 --> 00:04:01.590
payment. It's just going to be in your wallet. You got picked up,

74
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.680
you leave that's it. And I was like, we should have tipping. And they're like,

75
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.820
it adds a step. And we're trying to have no steps. You put your address in,

76
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.250
you click the button and you do nothing else.

77
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.300
And so we've been obsessed here in Silicon Valley is how many clicks can we take

78
00:04:15.301 --> 00:04:16.110
out of the process?

79
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.970
<v 0>I guess Amazon is incredible at that as well.</v>

80
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.710
<v 1>Absolutely. One click was the start of it.</v>

81
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.990
And then you look at clubhouse as an example,

82
00:04:21.991 --> 00:04:25.020
you open clubhouse and you see rooms, you click on it, you're listening.

83
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.530
So in one click, you're listening. And then in one click,

84
00:04:28.531 --> 00:04:31.350
if you raise your hand or you get invited and you say, yes, you're speaking.

85
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.550
So it's two clicks to speak one click to listen. Yeah. There, I mean,

86
00:04:35.551 --> 00:04:39.600
the only way they could make that app work even faster is if you opened it up

87
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.280
and your microphone was turned on and you, which is, yeah, that's kind of scary,

88
00:04:44.281 --> 00:04:45.690
but that is the next evolution.

89
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.650
And what happens when you go that fast is you get unintended consequences.

90
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.340
And so this is why Facebook has had more fines than any company in the history

91
00:04:53.341 --> 00:04:55.950
of Silicon Valley, just giant fines for doing stuff like this.

92
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.210
And one of them was,

93
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.090
I don't know if you remember when they created groups or if you have a group for

94
00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:01.680
your podcast, but you know,

95
00:05:01.681 --> 00:05:04.290
you can just add people to a group without their permission.

96
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.700
And there was this famous case when they first came out with it. Um,

97
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.700
somebody created a NAMBLA fake group,

98
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.600
national men love boy association or whatever, like pedophilia association.

99
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.450
And they added Zuckerberg, Mike Arrington, myself,

100
00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:21.840
and like 20 other famous people in Silicon Valley. And I was like,

101
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.210
and then somebody takes a screenshot of it and they're like, you're in NAMBLA.

102
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.160
And I'm like, no, Facebook last year. And then Zuckerberg's response was, well,

103
00:05:29.161 --> 00:05:31.770
if your friends put you in that NAMBLA group, you should get new friends.

104
00:05:31.771 --> 00:05:33.870
And it was like, you got put in there too. Yeah.

105
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.540
And then the sad part about it was there were a group of young men who were gay

106
00:05:39.541 --> 00:05:43.020
and who were in college and there was a gay choir in their college and the

107
00:05:43.021 --> 00:05:46.170
person who was coordinating their Facebook group added them.

108
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.790
So it wasn't enough for Zuckerberg to make it so anybody could add anybody to

109
00:05:50.791 --> 00:05:54.810
any group because it will grow faster. Let alone, you have to confirm,

110
00:05:54.811 --> 00:05:55.830
you want to be added to the group.

111
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.660
What it also did was posted it on their walls to increase engagement.

112
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.920
And what they inadvertently did was they outdid a bunch of 18,

113
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:08.270
19 year olds in college to their families because they joined the gay men's

114
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:12.680
choir at some college. And this is the kind of way, you know,

115
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:17.150
this is where Silicon Valley needs to check itself and to do better is you have

116
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:20.750
to really think, well, there is my incentive to grow faster.

117
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.240
And then there's what's right for society. And for the individual,

118
00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:25.580
you got to think it through, think it through.

119
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.760
<v 2>It's sometimes very difficult.</v>

120
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.620
This is where vision is required to anticipate the unintended consequences.

121
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.430
It seems like Mark Zuckerberg is not very good at that.
