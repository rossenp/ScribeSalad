1
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.640
<v 0>One of the ways that people can help is by adding to the knowledge base.</v>

2
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.490
And that's really, basically anybody if the tooling is right.

3
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.830
And I'm the other way, I kind of want to ask you about your thoughts on this.

4
00:00:14.831 --> 00:00:19.510
<v 2>So you've had, and like you said, in government, and, um, you have big clients,</v>

5
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.020
you had a lot of clients, but most of the disrupted and secrecy,

6
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.650
because of the nature of the relationship of the kind of things you're helping

7
00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:29.710
them with. So that's one way to operate.

8
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.320
And another way to operate is more in the open where it's more consumer

9
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.170
facing. And so, uh, you know,

10
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.280
hence something like open cycle is born at some point or there's.

11
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.080
<v 1>No, that that's a misconception.</v>

12
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.410
<v 0>Oh, well, let's go there. So what, uh,</v>

13
00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:49.750
what is open psych and how was it born to.

14
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.930
<v 1>As I wanted to say, um, and I want to say each of them before the other,</v>

15
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.790
so it's going to be difficult, but we'll come back to open psych in a minute.

16
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.110
But one of the terms of our contracts with all of our

17
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.600
customers and partners is

18
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.760
knowledge you have that is genuinely proprietary to you.

19
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.380
We will respect that.

20
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.400
We'll make sure that it's marked as proprietary to you in the psych knowledge

21
00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:19.630
base. No one other than you will be able to see it if you don't want them to.

22
00:01:19.631 --> 00:01:24.370
And it won't be used in inferences other than for you.

23
00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:25.510
And so, however,

24
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.150
any knowledge which is necessary in building any applications

25
00:01:31.151 --> 00:01:34.900
for you and with you, which is publicly available,

26
00:01:34.901 --> 00:01:38.890
general human knowledge is not going to be proprietary.

27
00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:42.160
It's going to just become part of the normal psych knowledge base.

28
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.420
And it will be, um, openly available to everyone who has access to psych.

29
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.400
So that's an important constraint that we never went back on. Even when we,

30
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.640
uh, got pushback from companies, which we often did,

31
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.660
who wanted to claim that almost everything they were telling us was proprietary.

32
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.213
Uh, so.

33
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.590
<v 0>So there's a line between very domain specific companies,</v>

34
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.550
specific stuff, and the general knowledge that comes from that.

35
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.760
<v 1>Yes. Or if you imagine say it's an oil company,</v>

36
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.860
there are things which they would expect any new petroleum engineer they

37
00:02:17.861 --> 00:02:20.110
hired to already know. Right.

38
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.940
And it's not okay for them to consider that that is proprietary.

39
00:02:24.941 --> 00:02:27.220
And that sometimes the company will say, well,

40
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.760
we're the first ones to pay you to represent that in psych. Yeah.

41
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.140
And our attitude is some polite form, tough.

42
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.660
The deal is this, take it or leave it. And in a few cases,

43
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.510
they've left it in most cases. Um, they'll,

44
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.010
they'll see our point of view and take it because that's how we've built the

45
00:02:48.011 --> 00:02:50.200
psych system by, uh,

46
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.240
essentially tacking with the funding wins where people would fund

47
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.111
a project.

48
00:02:56.111 --> 00:03:00.520
And half of it would be general knowledge that stay permanently as part of

49
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:01.354
psych. And.

50
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.800
<v 0>With these partnerships,</v>

51
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:06.870
it's not like a distraction from the main psych development. It's a.

52
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.410
<v 1>Supportive small.</v>

53
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.630
<v 0>Distraction. It's a small, but it's not a complete one.</v>

54
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:12.130
So you're adding to the knowledge base. Yeah.

55
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.630
<v 1>Yes, absolutely. And we try to stay away from, um, projects, uh,</v>

56
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.360
that would not have that property. Um,

57
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:23.140
so let me go back and talk about open psych for a second.

58
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.110
So I've had a lot of trouble

59
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.990
expressing, convincing other AI researchers,

60
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.960
how important it is to use an expressive representation language.

61
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.790
Like we do this higher order logic rather than just using some

62
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.140
triple store knowledge graph type, uh, representation.

63
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.790
Um, and so as an attempt to show them

64
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.250
why they needed something more, we said, oh, well,

65
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.320
we'll represent this unimportant projection or shadow

66
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:04.030
or subset of psych.

67
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.130
That just happens to be the simple binary relations,

68
00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:13.720
the relation argument, one argument, two triples and so on. Um,

69
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.580
and then you'll see how much more useful it

70
00:04:18.581 --> 00:04:20.980
is if you had the entire site system.

71
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.230
So it's all well and good to have the taxonomic relations

72
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.140
between terms like person and night and sleep and bed and

73
00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:35.620
house and eyes and, and so on.

74
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.840
But think about how much more useful it would be if you also had all

75
00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:45.310
the rules of thumb about those things. Like people sleep at night,

76
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:47.740
they sleep lying down, they sleep with their eyes closed.

77
00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:52.240
They usually sleep in beds in our country. Uh, they sleep for hours at a time.

78
00:04:52.241 --> 00:04:55.850
They can be woken up. They don't like being woken up and so on and so on.

79
00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.880
And so it's that massive amount of knowledge, which is not part of open psych.

80
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.750
And we thought that all the researchers would then immediately immediately say,

81
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.620
oh my God,

82
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.330
of course we need the other 90% that you're not giving us let's

83
00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:14.740
partner and license psych so that we can use it in our research.

84
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.260
But instead what people said is, oh,

85
00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:20.440
even the bit you've released is so much better than anything we had,

86
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.590
we'll just make do with this. And so if you look,

87
00:05:23.591 --> 00:05:26.410
there are a lot of robotics companies today, for example,

88
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:30.940
which use open psych as their fundamental ontology. Um,

89
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.470
and in some sense,

90
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.670
the whole world missed the point of open psych.

91
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.540
And we were doing it to show people why that's not really what they wanted.

92
00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:45.370
And too many people thought somehow that this was psych or that this was in fact

93
00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:49.030
good enough for them. And they never even bothered coming, um,

94
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.270
coming to us to get access to the full psych, but.

95
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.970
<v 0>There's two parts to open sites.</v>

96
00:05:53.971 --> 00:05:57.740
So one is convincing people on the idea on the power of this general kind of

97
00:05:57.741 --> 00:06:02.390
representation of knowledge and the value that you hold in having acquired that

98
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:06.470
knowledge and built it and continue to build it. And the other is the code base.

99
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.020
This is the code side of it.

100
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:14.390
So my sense of the code base that psycho psych is operating

101
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:15.590
with. I mean,

102
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.600
it has the technical debt of the three decades plus, right?

103
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.470
This is the exact same problem that Google had to deal with with the early

104
00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:27.890
version of TensorFlow. It's still dealing with that,

105
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.950
that to basically break, uh,

106
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.320
compatibility with the past several times.

107
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.340
And that's only over a period of a couple of years, but they,

108
00:06:37.341 --> 00:06:40.970
I think successfully opened up, it's very risky,

109
00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:45.890
very gutsy move to open up TensorFlow and then pie torch and the

110
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:46.760
Facebook side.

111
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.430
And what you see is there's a magic place where you can find a

112
00:06:52.431 --> 00:06:57.320
community. We could develop a community that builds onto on the system

113
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.390
without taking away any of, not any, but most of the value.

114
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.420
So most of the value that Google has is still a Google.

115
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.850
Most of the value that Facebook has still Facebook,

116
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.440
even though some of this major machine learning tooling is released into the

117
00:07:12.441 --> 00:07:16.100
open. My question is not so much in the knowledge,

118
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.050
which is also a big part of open psych,

119
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.380
but all the different kinds of tooling.

120
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:26.330
So the there's the kind of all the kinds of stuff you can do on the knowledge

121
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:31.190
graph, knowledge base, whatever we call it, there's the inference engines.

122
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:31.731
So there,

123
00:07:31.731 --> 00:07:36.140
there could be some probably are a bunch of proprietary stuff you want to kind

124
00:07:36.141 --> 00:07:40.370
of keep secret and there's probably some stuff you can open up completely and

125
00:07:40.371 --> 00:07:44.060
then let the community build up enough community where they develop stuff on top

126
00:07:44.061 --> 00:07:44.990
of it. Yes,

127
00:07:44.991 --> 00:07:48.050
there'll be those publications and academic work and all that kind of stuff.

128
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.670
And, uh, and also the tooling of adding to the knowledge base, right?

129
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.140
Like developing, you know,

130
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:58.370
there's an incredible Mo like there's so many people that are just really good

131
00:07:58.371 --> 00:08:00.740
at this kind of stuff in the open source community.

132
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.660
So my question for you is like,

133
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:07.340
have you struggled with this kind of idea that you have so much value in your

134
00:08:07.341 --> 00:08:10.190
company already, you've developed so many good things.

135
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.250
You have clients that really value your relationships,

136
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.610
and then there's this dormant giant open source community.

137
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:21.710
That as far as I know, you're not utilizing, is there,

138
00:08:21.711 --> 00:08:23.180
there's so many things to say there,

139
00:08:23.181 --> 00:08:28.100
but th there could be magic moments where the community builds up

140
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:33.680
large enough to where the artificial intelligence field that is

141
00:08:33.681 --> 00:08:38.480
currently 99.9% machine learning is dominated by machine learning

142
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:41.750
has a face shift towards like, uh,

143
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:46.100
or at least in part towards more like what you might call symbolic AI,

144
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:51.410
this whole place where psych is like at the center of,

145
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.030
and then as you know,

146
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:57.540
that requires a little bit leap of faith because you're now surfing and there'll

147
00:08:57.541 --> 00:09:02.190
be obviously competitors that will pop up and start making you nervous and all

148
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:02.910
that kind of stuff.

149
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:07.380
So do you think about the space of open sourcing some parts and not others,

150
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.980
how to leverage the community, all those kinds of things.

151
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.520
<v 1>Th that's a good question. And I think you phrased it the right way, which is,</v>

152
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:20.790
we're constantly struggling with the question of what to

153
00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:25.500
open source, what to make public, what to even publicly talk about. Right.

154
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.180
Um, and it's

155
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:33.300
their enormous pluses and minuses to every

156
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:34.583
alternative.

157
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:40.590
And it's very much like negotiating a very treacherous

158
00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:45.570
path part. Partly the analogy is like if you slip, uh,

159
00:09:45.571 --> 00:09:47.160
you could make a fatal mistake,

160
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:52.020
give away something which essentially kills you or fail to give away something

161
00:09:52.021 --> 00:09:55.920
which, um, who, um, failing to give it away, um, hurts you and so on.

162
00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.690
So it is, uh, it is a very tough, tough question.

163
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.820
Usually what we have done with, uh,

164
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.710
people who've approached us to collaborate on research is to say,

165
00:10:10.711 --> 00:10:15.690
we will make available to you the entire knowledge base

166
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:21.090
and executable copies of all of the code,

167
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.600
but only very,

168
00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:27.420
very limited source code access.

169
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:31.380
If you have some idea for how you might improve something or work with us on

170
00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:36.000
something. So let me also get back to one of the very,

171
00:10:36.001 --> 00:10:40.410
very first things we talked about here, um, which was

172
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.620
separating the question of how could you get a computer to do this at all,

173
00:10:46.621 --> 00:10:51.150
versus how could you get a computer to do this efficiently enough in real time?

174
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:56.280
And so one of the early lessons we learned

175
00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:01.530
was that we had to separate the epistemological problem of what should the

176
00:11:01.531 --> 00:11:02.400
system know,

177
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.540
separate that from the heuristic problem of how can the system reason

178
00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:08.670
efficiently with what it knows.

179
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:13.740
And so instead of trying to pick one

180
00:11:13.741 --> 00:11:15.300
representation language,

181
00:11:15.301 --> 00:11:19.830
which was the sweet spot or the best trade-off point between

182
00:11:19.831 --> 00:11:23.700
expressiveness of the language and efficiency of the language,

183
00:11:23.701 --> 00:11:28.080
if you had to pick one knowledge, graphs would probably be associative.

184
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.020
Triples would probably be about the best you could do.

185
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:34.740
And that's why we started there. But, um, after a few years,

186
00:11:34.741 --> 00:11:38.940
we realized that what we could do is we could split this and we could have

187
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:43.500
one nice clean epistemological level language,

188
00:11:43.501 --> 00:11:45.090
which is this higher order logic.

189
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.510
And we could have one or more grubby,

190
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:53.560
but efficient heuristic level modules that

191
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.830
opportunistically would say, oh,

192
00:11:56.831 --> 00:11:59.890
I can make progress on what you're trying to do over here.

193
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:04.720
I have a special method that will contribute a little bit toward a solution.

194
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:08.410
And so some subset of that. Exactly.

195
00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:12.910
So by now we have over a thousand of these heuristic level modules and they

196
00:12:12.911 --> 00:12:16.870
function as a kind of community of agents. And there's one of them,

197
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.710
which is a general theorem, prover and theory, in theory,

198
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:25.180
that's the only one you need, but in practice,

199
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:29.290
it always takes so long that you never want to call on it.

200
00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:34.090
You always want these other agents to very efficiently reason through it.

201
00:12:34.091 --> 00:12:36.610
It's sort of like if you're balancing a chemical equation,

202
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:40.000
you could go back to first principles. But in fact,

203
00:12:40.001 --> 00:12:43.270
there are algorithms which are vastly more efficient,

204
00:12:43.271 --> 00:12:46.300
or if you're trying to solve a quadratic equation,

205
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:50.920
you could go back to first principles of mathematics. But, um,

206
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:55.510
it's much better to simply recognize that this is a quadratic equation and apply

207
00:12:55.511 --> 00:12:59.350
the binomial formula and stopped you get your answer right away and so on.

208
00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:04.570
So think of these as like a thousand little experts that are

209
00:13:04.571 --> 00:13:09.430
all looking at everything that site gets asked and looking at everything

210
00:13:09.431 --> 00:13:13.480
that every other little agent has contributed almost like notes on a Blackboard

211
00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:16.540
notes on a, um, a whiteboard, um,

212
00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:20.620
and making additional notes when they think they can be helpful.

213
00:13:20.621 --> 00:13:25.480
And gradually that community of agents gets an answer to your question,

214
00:13:25.481 --> 00:13:27.610
gets a solution to your problem.

215
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:32.920
And if we ever come up in a domain application where psych is getting the

216
00:13:32.921 --> 00:13:35.560
right answer, but taking too long, uh,

217
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:40.180
then what we'll often do is talk to one of the human experts and

218
00:13:40.181 --> 00:13:45.070
say, uh, here's the, the set of reasoning steps that's like went through.

219
00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.340
You can see why it took it a long time to get the answer.

220
00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.180
How is it that you were able to answer that question in two seconds?

221
00:13:52.181 --> 00:13:56.920
And occasionally you'll get an expert who just says,

222
00:13:56.921 --> 00:14:00.400
well, I just know it, I just was able to do it or something. Um,

223
00:14:00.401 --> 00:14:01.810
and then you don't talk to them anymore,

224
00:14:01.811 --> 00:14:04.810
but sometimes you'll get an expert who says, um, well,

225
00:14:04.811 --> 00:14:06.760
let me introspect on that. Yes,

226
00:14:06.761 --> 00:14:10.960
here is a special representation we use just for

227
00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.270
acquiesced chemistry equations,

228
00:14:13.271 --> 00:14:17.080
or here's a special representation and a special technique,

229
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:21.460
which we can now apply to things in this special representation and so on.

230
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.230
And then you add that as the thousand and first HL heuristic level

231
00:14:26.231 --> 00:14:30.310
module. And from then on, um, in any application,

232
00:14:30.311 --> 00:14:33.940
if it ever comes up again, it will be able to contribute and so on.

233
00:14:33.941 --> 00:14:38.260
So that that's pretty much one of the main ways in which, um,

234
00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.590
psych has recouped this loss deficiency. Um,

235
00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:46.270
a second important way is meta reasoning. So, um,

236
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:51.160
you can speed things up by focusing on removing

237
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:55.460
from the system till all it has left is like minimal knowledge needed to,

238
00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.880
but that's the wrong thing to do, right? That would be like in a human,

239
00:14:58.881 --> 00:15:03.050
extra painting part of their brain or something that's really bad. So instead,

240
00:15:03.051 --> 00:15:05.780
what you want to do is give it meta-level advice,

241
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:10.490
tactical and strategic advice that enables it to reason about

242
00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:14.360
what kind of knowledge is going to be relevant to this problem.

243
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:18.440
What kind of tactics are going to be good to take in trying to attack this

244
00:15:18.441 --> 00:15:23.330
problem? When is it time to start trying to prove the negation of this thing?

245
00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:27.440
Because I'm knocking myself out, trying to prove it's true and maybe it's false.

246
00:15:27.441 --> 00:15:30.050
And if I just spend a minute, I can see that it's false or something.

247
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:35.300
<v 0>So, so it's like dynamically pruning the graph to, to, to only like,</v>

248
00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:38.300
based on the particular thing you're trying to inf.

249
00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:39.561
<v 1>Yes.</v>

250
00:15:39.561 --> 00:15:44.480
And so by now we have about 150 of these

251
00:15:44.481 --> 00:15:49.010
sort of like breakthrough ideas that have led to dramatic ups

252
00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:53.870
in the inference process. You know, where one of them was this ELL,

253
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:56.300
HL split and lots of HL modules.

254
00:15:56.301 --> 00:16:01.250
Another one was using meta and meta meta level reasoning to

255
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:05.840
reason about the reasoning that's going on and so on. Um, and you know,

256
00:16:05.841 --> 00:16:10.370
150 breakthroughs may sound like a lot, but you know, if you divide by 37 years,

257
00:16:10.371 --> 00:16:11.390
it's not as impressive.

258
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.960
<v 0>So there's these kind of heuristic modules that really help improve the,</v>

259
00:16:16.961 --> 00:16:17.660
the inference.
