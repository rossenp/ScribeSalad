00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.160
<v 0>So a lot of people know how much I love 2001 space Odyssey.</v>

2
00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.280
So I got all of these emails asking like,

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.560
uh, Hey bro, &lt;laugh&gt;, uh,

4
00:00:14.561 --> 00:00:18.040
do you know what's up with the monoliths in like the middle of the desert or

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.800
whatever it was? I don't, I, I haven't been actually paying attention.

6
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.630
I apologize. Uh, but, um,

7
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.230
you kind of mentioned offline that this was kind of cool and interesting. What,

8
00:00:27.231 --> 00:00:30.590
what do you make of these modelists and in general, uh, are you, um,

9
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.230
are you a fan of, uh, 2001 space Odyssey where monolith showed up?

10
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.830
Do you have any thoughts about either the science fiction,

11
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.790
the mythology of it or the reality of it?

12
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.140
<v 1>Yes. Okay. No.</v>

13
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.460
<v 0>Okay. And please say more &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

14
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.180
<v 1>Right. So first of all,</v>

15
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.900
cupric films are not ever easy for me because they're so weird. Right.

16
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.740
And I don't actually enjoy watching them, but that is that. Yeah.

17
00:00:59.741 --> 00:01:03.820
It doesn't take away from their incredible brilliance though. And their,

18
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:06.483
uh, merit.

19
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.370
So a 2001 space odysey is incredibly

20
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.010
visionary. And of course all those things that people say,

21
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.730
I don't have to restate them. Um, in terms of what I've,

22
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.690
it's a subtext to my book, by the way, I, I didn't mean it to be,

23
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.410
but it's almost, it's, it's almost a character in my book,

24
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.760
2001 is space odysey and when the monoliths started to appear again,

25
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.360
everything went crazy with my everything, internet, social media phone,

26
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.760
what's up, what's going on, right. Is this disclosure. And I thought, well,

27
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.280
you know, I'll tell you one thing is it's, let's look at the timing of it.

28
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.870
It's a cool, it's an art, you know? And, and then copy art and things like that.

29
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.070
It's actually happening at a really interesting time when all of us are forced

30
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.870
to go online when all of us are forced because of COVID. Right? Yeah. Yeah.

31
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:58.910
We're completely now invaded by the screen or we are invading the screen,

32
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.030
like we're living our infrastructure now is completely changed.

33
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.380
So the monolith basically, if art is to like show us life,

34
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.980
it certainly has, if that's an art project, somebody did an awesome job with it.

35
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.420
But apparently that monolith was there for a long time. Right. I mean,

36
00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:17.460
that's the thing it's been there for a couple years. So they said, okay,

37
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.220
all right. That said, um, if your, um, audience is interested,

38
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.370
I think the best theory about the meaning of the monolith is, um,

39
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.290
is Robert ager or Robert AER. I think it's Robert ager. Um,

40
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.370
he's got a website where he does analyses of films and it's called co

41
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.570
learning or co learning. And he does the meaning of the monolith.

42
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.330
Everyone should go look at that because I fully agree with him. One,

43
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.920
I studied meet different meanings of the monolith in 2001, a space Odyssey.

44
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.360
I was fascinated. Okay. So what is this about? Uh, his,

45
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.760
I accepted as soon as I listened to it, Sue and watched it.

46
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.520
So basically he says that the monolith is okay. Can you pick up your,

47
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.360
your phone here? What does that look like? &lt;laugh&gt;.

48
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.960
<v 0>It looks awfully a lot like a monolith. Yeah.</v>

49
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.521
<v 1>Okay.</v>

50
00:03:11.521 --> 00:03:16.240
So basically that's what he was saying was that cubic was basically the monolith

51
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.310
was technology or the screen in particular.

52
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.870
And he basically was saying that the cinema screen we were being, you know,

53
00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:25.790
completely. And if you think about it, look at all this,

54
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.710
we live in a screen culture. We have computer screens, uh, iPhone screens,

55
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.470
there's, you know, phone screens. We have TV screens, everything is so,

56
00:03:34.471 --> 00:03:36.150
you know, and now that COVID has come,

57
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.100
we're forced to go into these screens and we forced to live a different material

58
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.180
existence than we live, have lived before. So in, in my sense,

59
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.980
I think that if it's an art project, it's a really good one for that.

60
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.580
<v 0>So it's the, I like, I like that, uh, that meaning of it,</v>

61
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.380
it's the screen and the screen could take all, all kinds of forms. I mean, uh,

62
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.490
our procession system, in a sense as a screen, uh,

63
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.890
between reality and our mind, the,

64
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.210
the screen of the computer is a screen, the,

65
00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.290
the virtual reality worlds that we might be one day living in it,

66
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.450
there will be an interface. I mean, ultimately it's about the interface.

67
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.810
That's interesting. It's an interface to another,

68
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.360
another world of ideas.

69
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.760
<v 1>It's also material change. It's a change in our mature. I mean,</v>

70
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.640
when people talk about augmented reality, I say,

71
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:34.960
we already live in augmented reality. Yeah. Don't we, because this isn't the,

72
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.320
this isn't our grandparents' existence.

73
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.800
<v 0>Yeah. Like, I, I,</v>

74
00:04:39.801 --> 00:04:44.670
sometimes you have to pause and remind yourself how weirdly different

75
00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:48.350
this reality is than just even like, I mean, 30 years ago,

76
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.710
the internet changed so much and social media has changed so much

77
00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.190
about actually just the space of our thinking.

78
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.620
Wikipedia changed so much about the office of our knowledge,

79
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.380
the way we interact with knowledge. I mean,

80
00:05:06.381 --> 00:05:10.300
it offloaded our long term memory about facts

81
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.740
onto a digital format. So in the sense that expanded our mind, uh,

82
00:05:15.741 --> 00:05:18.340
it's kind of interesting. I, I,

83
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.810
I'd be curious to see if he has just one interpretation. I wonder there's.

84
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.050
<v 1>Corresponded with him. Yes. So over the years, he and I have corresponded, um,</v>

85
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.410
and I told him, I said, look, I'm gonna be using this in my book.

86
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.370
So I think you should read what I say. And he was,

87
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.290
he of course wanted to see it. &lt;laugh&gt;.

88
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.370
<v 0>So what do you think about your book? Did he get a chance to.</v>

89
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.890
<v 1>Read? Um, yeah. Oh yeah. So, um,</v>

90
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.640
he is a nonbeliever in and alien intelligence and UFOs,

91
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.960
but he, and that's fine, but I,

92
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.520
I still agree with him that the meaning of the monolith was the screen,

93
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.640
but that doesn't mean the screen. Isn't like what David Bowie said. Right.

94
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.600
So it's not exclusive. So I could still use his theory,

95
00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.560
but differ from the conclusions.
