00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.880
<v 0>So I wonder how much things that don't yet exist and</v>

2
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.040
can exist is in the space of algorithms, in the space of recommender systems.

3
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.720
So in the space of how the feed is generated.

4
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.760
So we kind of talk about the actual elements of the, um, the content.

5
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.190
That's what we've been talking the difference with between photos, between, uh,

6
00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:26.590
short videos, longer videos.

7
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.110
I wonder how much disruption it's possible in the way the algorithms work.

8
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.390
Because a lot of the criticism toward social media is in the way the algorithms

9
00:00:35.391 --> 00:00:38.910
work currently. And it feels like, first of all,

10
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.750
talking about product market fit,

11
00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:44.900
there's certainly a hunger for, um,

12
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.820
social media algorithms that do something different.

13
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.820
I don't think anyone everyone's like complaining, this is not doing, this is,

14
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.180
this is hurting me and this is hurting society,

15
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.740
but I keep doing it cuz I'm addicted to it. And they say,

16
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.770
we want something different, but we don't know what it feels like, a, uh,

17
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.370
just different, uh, it feels like there's a hunger for that,

18
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.890
but that's in the space of algorithms.

19
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.210
I wonder if it's possible to disrupt in that space. Absolutely.

20
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.003
<v 1>Um,</v>

21
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.130
I have this thesis that the worst part about social networks is that there,

22
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.840
uh, is the people &lt;laugh&gt;, it's, it's,

23
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.200
it's a line that sounds funny, right?

24
00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:33.960
Because like that's why you call it a social network. Um,

25
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.280
but what does social networks actually do for you? Like just think, you know,

26
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:42.080
like imagine you were an alien and you landed and someone says, Hey,

27
00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:44.960
there's this site, it's a social network. We're not gonna tell you what it is.

28
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.230
Just what does it do? And you had to explain it to them. Just two things. One,

29
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.430
uh, is that people, you know, and have social ties with, uh,

30
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.510
distribute updates through whether it's, uh, you know,

31
00:01:58.511 --> 00:02:02.710
photos or videos about their lives so that you don't have to physically be with

32
00:02:02.711 --> 00:02:04.790
them, but you can keep in touch with them. That's one,

33
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:07.980
that's like a big part of Instagram. That's a big part of snap.

34
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.540
It is not part of TikTok at all. So there's another big part,

35
00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:15.260
which is there's all this content out in the world.

36
00:02:15.261 --> 00:02:19.380
That's entertaining whether you wanna watch it or you wanna read it.

37
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.220
Um, and matchmaking between content that exists in the world and

38
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.850
people that want that content turns out to be like a really big business.

39
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.770
<v 0>Right. Search and discovery. Would you.</v>

40
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.130
<v 1>Search and discovery? But my point is it could be video. It could be text,</v>

41
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.010
it could be websites. It could be, I mean, think back to, um,

42
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.210
think back to like dig right or stumble upon or yeah. Right.

43
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.250
<v 0>Nice. Yeah. But.</v>

44
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.080
<v 1>Like what did those do?</v>

45
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.800
Like they basically distributed interesting content to you, right? Um,

46
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.240
I think the most interesting part or,

47
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.360
or the future of social networks is going to be making them less social because

48
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.160
I think people are a part of the root cause of the problem. So for instance, um,

49
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.880
often in recommender systems, we talk about two stages.

50
00:03:05.881 --> 00:03:07.680
There's a candidate generation step,

51
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.960
which is just like of our vast trove of stuff that you might want to see

52
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.360
what small subset should we pick for you. Okay.

53
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.350
Typically that is grabbed from things your friends have shared, right.

54
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.310
Then there's a, a ranking step, which says, okay, now given these a hundred,

55
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.390
200 things, depends on the network, right?

56
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.070
Let's like be really good about ranking them and generally rank the things up

57
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:36.270
higher that get the most engagement. Right? So what's the problem with that.

58
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.910
Step one is we've limb,

59
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.020
everything you could possibly see to things that your friends have chosen to

60
00:03:43.021 --> 00:03:46.220
share, or maybe not friends, but influencers,

61
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.140
what things do people generally want to share.

62
00:03:49.141 --> 00:03:52.180
They wanna share things that are gonna get likes that are gonna show up broadly.

63
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.140
So they tend to be more emotionally driven.

64
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.380
They tend to be more risque or whatever. So why do we have this problem?

65
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.050
It's because we show people,

66
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:05.930
things people have decided to share and those things self-select to being the

67
00:04:05.931 --> 00:04:09.850
things that are most divisive. So how do you fix that?

68
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.890
Well, what if you just imagine for a second that,

69
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.530
why do you have to grab things from things your friends have shared?

70
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.520
Why not just like grab things? That's really fascinating to me.

71
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.920
And that's something I've been thinking a lot about and just like, you know,

72
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.400
why is it that when you log onto Twitter,

73
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.320
you're just sitting there looking at things from accounts that you've followed

74
00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:38.920
for whatever reason and TikTok, I think has done a wonderful job here,

75
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:39.481
which is like,

76
00:04:39.481 --> 00:04:43.630
you can literally be at anyone and if you produce something fascinating,

77
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.910
it'll go viral. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

78
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.150
But like you don't have to be someone that anyone knows you don't have to have

79
00:04:50.151 --> 00:04:53.910
built up a giant following. You don't have to have paid for followers.

80
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.390
You don't have to try to maintain those followers.

81
00:04:56.391 --> 00:04:59.590
You literally just have to produce something interesting. That is,

82
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.500
I think the future of social networking, that's the,

83
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.060
that's the direction things will head.

84
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.500
And I think what you'll find is it's far less about people manipulating

85
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.140
distribution and far more about what is like,

86
00:05:12.141 --> 00:05:17.060
is this content good and good is obviously a vague definition that

87
00:05:17.061 --> 00:05:18.100
we could spend hours on,

88
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.050
but different networks I think will decide different value functions to

89
00:05:23.051 --> 00:05:25.010
decide what is good and what isn't good. And I, I,

90
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.530
I think that's a fascinating direction.

91
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.410
<v 0>So that's almost like creating an internet. I mean,</v>

92
00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:33.370
that's what Google did for webpages that did the, you know, page rank search.

93
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.330
Yeah. So discovery, you don't,

94
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.290
you don't follow anybody on Google when you use a search engine,

95
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.840
you just discover webpages. And so what take that does is saying,

96
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.960
let's start from scratch. Let's like,

97
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.320
like start a new internet and have people discover stuff on that new internet,

98
00:05:51.321 --> 00:05:53.520
within a particular kind of pool of.

99
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.960
<v 1>People. Well, what's so fascinating about this is like the, the, um,</v>

100
00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.680
field of information retrieval.

101
00:05:59.681 --> 00:06:02.680
Like I always talked about as I was studying this stuff,

102
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.600
I would always use the word query document. So I was like,

103
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.960
why are they saying query document? It's like, they're literally imagine,

104
00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.520
like if you just stop thinking about query is like literally a search query and

105
00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.960
a query could be a person. I mean, a lot of the way,

106
00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.510
I'm not gonna claim to know how Instagram or Facebook machine learning works

107
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.190
today. But you know,

108
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.750
if you want to find a match for a query,

109
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:29.270
the query is actually the attributes of the person, their age, their gender,

110
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.233
where they're from,

111
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.670
maybe some kind of summarization of their interests and, and that's a query,

112
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.460
right? And that match is against documents. And by the way,

113
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.740
documents don't have to be text. They can be videos they're however long,

114
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.420
I don't know what the limit is on TikTok these days, they keep changing it.

115
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.900
My point is just, you've got a query,

116
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:52.220
which is someone in search of something that they wanna match and you've got the

117
00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.660
document and it doesn't have to be text. It could be anything.

118
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.050
And how do you match make, and that's one of these, like, I mean,

119
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.570
I have spent a lot of time thinking about this and I don't claim to have

120
00:07:01.571 --> 00:07:02.650
mastered it at all,

121
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.930
but I think it's so fascinating about where that will go with new social

122
00:07:06.931 --> 00:07:07.450
networks.
