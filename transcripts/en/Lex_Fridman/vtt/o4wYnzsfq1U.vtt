00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.070
<v 0>What is love? Well,</v>

2
00:00:07.071 --> 00:00:09.570
what do you think this thing is? Uh, like, uh,

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.600
our attachment to other human beings.

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.690
And is it something that we should give to just a few people? Yes. That's the,

5
00:00:17.691 --> 00:00:22.530
for sure. When I was working with deal Hugo in his book, he didn't use the term,

6
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:27.390
but he was describing like low key depression and he talked

7
00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:32.010
about how he was in the airport and he noticed a girl had a red dress and he

8
00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:33.930
went up to thanked her and she was like waiting for,

9
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.230
and he had realized he hadn't registered color in like weeks.

10
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.950
And I think love is like that.

11
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.970
When you see someone and you just like, Oh, like,

12
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.870
like your eyes are open. Like this is something I've never seen before.

13
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.220
I want more of this, that kind of thing. It's really, uh,

14
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.800
it really disorients. And reorients your thinking, don't you find that like,

15
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.750
the world is full of that, like nonstop. It's not just like a person either.

16
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:08.100
It's like, but it, yes. But when it's in a person it's a whole other level,

17
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.270
because it's like, I could have, this is going to be great for years. It's like,

18
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.350
you know, every day it's something new. I mean, that, that is, and that is rare.

19
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.750
You think is where I might find someone who you could talk to them for years and

20
00:01:21.751 --> 00:01:25.350
not run out of things to talk to this show for years. Yes. That's rare.

21
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.030
And know that they really, if you leave the room, they will do right by you.

22
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.080
I that's really rare. Well,

23
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.040
from a Russian perspective, you just don't give them another choice.
