1
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.630
<v 0>Who are the Taliban? What do they stand for?</v>

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.800
What do they want obviously year by year, this changes.

3
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:14.250
So what is the nature of this organization?

4
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.690
<v 2>Can they be a legitimate, peaceful, kind, respectful,</v>

5
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.490
uh, government sort of holder of power or,

6
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.780
or are they fundamentally not capable of doing so?

7
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.400
<v 1>Yeah, I mean,</v>

8
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.810
the briefest answer would be that they are a clerical

9
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.560
slash military organization. Um,

10
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.220
they have, this is kind of a

11
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.400
imperfect metaphor, but years ago, a German scholar,

12
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.860
he's the term caravan to describe them.

13
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.440
<v 2>And that has some attractive elements because</v>

14
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.940
different people who joined the Taliban for different purposes at different

15
00:00:56.941 --> 00:01:00.960
times, but today, and people tell us, you know,

16
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.480
scholars who know more about the women than I said, listen,

17
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.530
the Taliban is this kind of hodgepodge of different actors and people and

18
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.460
competing interests.

19
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.530
And I think so we have a lot of scholars I listened to there. It's,

20
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.210
polycentric, it's got people in the city and that city and so on.

21
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:22.230
I think actually I was always very skeptical. How do they know this? I mean,

22
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.620
this is an orientation that doesn't want you to know, um,

23
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.090
where that money comes from and so on.

24
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.620
<v 1>But I would say now that we have a clear picture of what has happened,</v>

25
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.170
I'd say they are a astoundingly well-organized clerical military

26
00:01:37.171 --> 00:01:41.850
organization that has a very cohesive

27
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.100
and enduring ideology, which is quite idiosyncratic.

28
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.520
If we zoom out and continue the conversation we're having about Islam and how we

29
00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:54.690
think about radicalism and, you know, who's drawn to what, um,

30
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.970
people throw different terms around to describe the Talan some use a

31
00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:04.920
term that links it to a kind of school of thought born in the 19th century,

32
00:02:04.921 --> 00:02:09.690
in India, the Deobandi school. Uh, but if you look at their teachings,

33
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.260
it's very clear. Now I think that these labels it's like saying, you know,

34
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.170
you're an MIT guy. Well, what does that mean? I mean,

35
00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:20.820
MIT is home to dozens of different potentially kinds of

36
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.660
intellectual orientations, right? I mean, attaching the name of the school.

37
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.330
Doesn't quite capture. I mean.

38
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.080
<v 0>It's complicated. I mean, actually MIT is interesting because it's,</v>

39
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.450
I would say MIT is different than Stanford, for example. Yeah.

40
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.010
I think MIT has a more kind of narrow. Yeah. I hear.

41
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.890
<v 1>You. Um, about analogy, algae, my apartment. Well.</v>

42
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:41.071
<v 0>No,</v>

43
00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:45.630
it's interesting because I would argue that there's some aspect of a brand like

44
00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:47.400
Taliban or MIT,

45
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.680
no relation that has a kind of,

46
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.990
uh, interact like the,

47
00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:59.800
the brand results in the behavior of the like enforces a kind of behavior and

48
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:02.770
the people and the people feed the brand. And like there's a loop.

49
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.100
I think Stanford is a good example of something that's more distributed.

50
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:11.020
There's sufficient amount of diversity in like all kinds of like centers and

51
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:13.630
all that kind of stuff that the, the, the,

52
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.520
the brand doesn't become one thing MIT, so engineering it's.

53
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.510
<v 1>Okay. Scratching my te let's scratch it to you.</v>

54
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.070
Cause I think Stanford's more like MIT than, than, than you might imagine, but,

55
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.610
uh, yeah.

56
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.330
<v 0>Isn't Alwan, isn't it pretty, I don't think there's a diversity.</v>

57
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.080
<v 1>So yeah. So sorry. So just to rephrase, so, so people say, oh,</v>

58
00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:38.860
the day Bondi school, I'm like, what does that mean? But the tailbone are,

59
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:40.803
they're an ethnic movement.

60
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.000
They represent a vision of punched in power,

61
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.163
right?

62
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.360
Positions are people who are quite internally diverse who actually

63
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.640
speak multiple dialects of Pashto who reside across the

64
00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.470
frontier of [inaudible]. And I've kind of done. There are postions to

65
00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.470
 live all over the planet, right? This

66
00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.470
 community, Moscow, California, everywhere. Right? So it's a global diaspora of

67
00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.470
sorts passions have a kind of geological imagination so that lots of machines

68
00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.470
 can tell you the names of their grandparents, great grandparents and so on. And that's kind of 

69
00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.470
a

70
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.303
, there's a sense of pride in that posture. Language is a kind of core element of that identity, but it's not universal. So for example, you can meet people who say, I am Pashtoon, but I don't know Pashto.

71
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.740
So as you, as you claw away at this idea, it's a morphous.

72
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.930
It also means different things, different people at different times.

73
00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:42.610
So saying the tub on our posture and requires lots of qualifiers

74
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:47.110
because lots of patients will say, no, no, I, I, I have nothing to tell Bon.

75
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.180
I hate those people. You know,

76
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.040
so the Taiwan tried to mobilize other passions with limited

77
00:04:54.041 --> 00:04:58.630
success, but their core membership is almost exclusively Pashtoon and they say,

78
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.950
no, no, we represent Afghans. We represent pious Muslims.

79
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.260
And so in recent two, three years, they've gone further to say, no,

80
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.970
we have an ethnic groups. We have whose bags we have Tajiks we have Hazara is.

81
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.580
And in the north of Afghanistan in recent years,

82
00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:19.710
they did do a bit better at drawing in people who were very disaffected because

83
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.960
the government and they were able to diversify their ranks somewhat.

84
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.350
But if you want to say August 15 and who they've appointed,

85
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.450
what language they've used, how they've presented themselves, it's clear that,

86
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.430
you know, they are Pashtoon,

87
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.780
they are male and they are extremely ideologically

88
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.750
cohesive and disciplined, I'd say, right?

89
00:05:43.751 --> 00:05:46.720
So I think that a lot of the poly centrism, blah, blah, blah,

90
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.110
some of that stuff was a way to fight a war. Um, they are,

91
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.200
they are fundamentally, you know, a guerrilla movement.

92
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.620
They see themselves as kind of pious Robin hoods.

93
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.210
The rhetoric is very much about taking from the rich take from the privilege

94
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.280
given to the, before being on the side of the underdog, fighting against evil.

95
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.880
And so, I mean their, their, their bag, if you like their thing,

96
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.270
their central theme, their brand is about public morality.

97
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.010
And so their origin story go much 9 94 is that they interceded,

98
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.540
they broke up a gang of criminals who were trying to rape people.

99
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.880
And so there's a ranching kind of like emphasis on like sexuality

100
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.500
and on, on poem morality. It really being the core of like, you know,

101
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.400
we're going to restore order and,

102
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.350
and pump morality and how that translates into governance is something they've

103
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:41.510
never sorted out. I mean, how do you run a banking system?

104
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.570
If you're in touch priorities are really about, you know,

105
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.640
the length of beard and then,

106
00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:50.540
and then their path to power and a kind of abstract sense. I mean,

107
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.390
a lot of that was very much driven by, um,

108
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.880
if you like propagating the prompts of martyrdom. And that sounds,

109
00:06:58.881 --> 00:07:01.670
I don't mean to say that in a way that to make it sound ridiculous,

110
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.710
make sound like it's, um, you know, a moral judgment. It's simply a fact,

111
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.360
it's a fact of their appeal that they promised young men who have known

112
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:16.580
nothing else, but studying in certain schools, if at all,

113
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.860
but they've known, fighting, and they've known,

114
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.700
they've known victimization and this isn't, I'm not asking for like,

115
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.520
sympathy for them. But I think the reality is a lot of, uh,

116
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.640
we know about the kind of foot soldiers is that they,

117
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.430
they lost families and bombings, um, in airstrikes in night raids,

118
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.990
you know, I mean, orphans have always been a stream, um,

119
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.090
living in an all male society, uh, not knowing girls,

120
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:44.953
not knowing women,

121
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.040
hearing things from outside about places like Kabul as it has always been this

122
00:07:49.041 --> 00:07:53.030
kind of urban, rural dimension. It's not, it's not just that,

123
00:07:53.031 --> 00:07:54.890
but I think there's a,

124
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:59.840
there's a whole imagination that being Taliban captures.
