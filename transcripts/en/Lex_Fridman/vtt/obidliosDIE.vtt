00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.180
<v 0>What's the best motivator for you or for your athletes?</v>

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.700
Hatred of losing or love of winning?

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.180
<v 1>For me personally, it was definitely the hatred of losing.</v>

4
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.340
I was not a guy that was about pageantry.

5
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.220
I was not a guy that was about the parade. Um,

6
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.970
when I wrestled in Atlanta, um,

7
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.290
I rented a three cylinder geo with my wife,

8
00:00:26.291 --> 00:00:28.730
drove home and mow the lawn because it hadn't been moaned for a month.

9
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.170
And I remember one of our neighbors driving by and they were like,

10
00:00:32.171 --> 00:00:35.690
they did a double take, like that's I thought he was in Atlanta. Well,

11
00:00:35.691 --> 00:00:38.490
I wasn't Atlanta yesterday and just sat on the stand and got a gold medal put

12
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:41.330
around my neck. Um, that's how I was. Um,

13
00:00:41.331 --> 00:00:44.560
that doesn't mean that it was a right approach or the wrong approach.

14
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.160
It's just what worked for me.

15
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.880
<v 0>But when you were a kid, you and Terry,</v>

16
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.760
you dreamed about winning that Olympic gold. Yeah.

17
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.600
<v 1>About winning. Then there is the, the, the lure of winning,</v>

18
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.240
but what drives you is that, um, you know, as you move forward,

19
00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:00.520
there's just no

20
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.850
reason that you have to settle for anything but being the best. And if,

21
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:07.970
if it just,

22
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.210
it would get to you to the point where that's not gonna happen to me again.

23
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.410
<v 0>So what, what, the thing that keeps you up at night is the, the losses.</v>

24
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.650
And that's not, that's not gonna happen to me again.

25
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.450
That's the thought that keeps you up at night.

26
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.240
<v 1>That's the thought that drives you in your training? That's what, why you do,</v>

27
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.320
you know, nine ropes when Gable says, do three ropes and buddy pushups,

28
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:34.040
and you're outta here and you do nine, or you do 'em until you can't do anymore.

29
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.160
And it's a very rare ingredient. The older I get, the more rare I find it is.

30
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.280
<v 0>The ingredient of loss, feeding,</v>

31
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.350
feeding the drive of hard.

32
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.070
<v 1>Training, maybe that, because everybody's so worried about the negative,</v>

33
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.110
whatever, and you're putting too much pressure on yourself. So maybe that,

34
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.550
but what I meant was is when a coach says, okay, finish with four ropes and,

35
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.510
you know, buddy pushups in four way neck, you know,

36
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.220
I would do 12 or 10 that that's rare.

37
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.180
<v 0>It's no longer about what the coach says.</v>

38
00:02:08.181 --> 00:02:12.060
It's your own demons that you're trying to, right. Exercise out.

39
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.420
What's the few losses you've had in your life.

40
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.540
Are all of them just melt together or is there something that stands out

41
00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:21.280
in your mind?

42
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.260
<v 1>I'm I'm guy that remembers, um, my career that, well,</v>

43
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.050
I know that I am judged on a very small

44
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.130
portion of my life and it's minutes of wrestling matches, you know, lot of,

45
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.410
lot of winning, but there's some losing in there too. And, you know,

46
00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:41.370
people think they know you because of that.

47
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.090
And they think they know you because they see you in a press conference. But,

48
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.560
um, you know, to go back to the original question, you know,

49
00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:51.520
I don't know how to answer that.

50
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.600
<v 0>So there's no losses that just that eat at.</v>

51
00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.400
<v 1>You still there's opponents that I have learned a great deal from. I mean,</v>

52
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.480
my loss to John Smith, uh, in 1991, um,

53
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.160
us opened was something that I learned a lot about.

54
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.560
Um, I learned a lot about positioning.

55
00:03:12.561 --> 00:03:16.280
I learned a lot about the importance of parter, um, you know,

56
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.110
in a certain kind of easy way.

57
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.030
I learned that I could go with the best guy in the world,

58
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.110
even though it was 14 to four mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

59
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.350
And this is when tech falls were 15 or 12 points. So I didn't get tech fall.

60
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.230
And I wasn't that wasn't a badge honor for me,

61
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.430
but I knew I could go with him because it was one point tank downs.

62
00:03:31.431 --> 00:03:35.990
I scored four tank downs on him, and I learned that I had to move my feet.

63
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.580
Um, and I learned what it meant to move feet constantly. And, and there's no,

64
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.853
Frank John Smith is a very,

65
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.860
very intense competitor that people know that now six time world

66
00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:53.860
Olympic champion. And I felt that firsthand, but I did not go in there.

67
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.580
Um, taking a backseat, even though the score, um,

68
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.170
was very lot excited, but you knew you could stand with the best of the world.

69
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.610
I knew that I, this is what this is about and you know what?

70
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:11.530
You move your feet and you don't give up a lace. That's so tight that it,

71
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.850
you, you can't, you know, feel your calf muscle, you know,

72
00:04:14.851 --> 00:04:16.970
and I gotta get ready for the consolation side of the bracket.

73
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:20.560
Cause I believe that was in the semis. You know, you know,

74
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.600
you just learn from that. And it was, it was better than learning from,

75
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.520
you know,

76
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.920
a win over a second ranked senior level guy when you're a junior in college.

77
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.280
Right. You know, you wrestl on the best on a stage.
