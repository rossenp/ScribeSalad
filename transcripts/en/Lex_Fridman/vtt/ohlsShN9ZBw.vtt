00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.870
<v 0>You said Jorge Choa was perhaps the brains of the me and</v>

2
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.180
cartel. What was he like?

3
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.340
And why do you say he was the brains?

4
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:15.381
<v 1>Well,</v>

5
00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:20.220
he was the gentleman and I suppose he shipped in no telling how many

6
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.810
more times of cocaine than Pablo did you and him and his brothers,

7
00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:27.490
you could tell by the, they had on each, each load,

8
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.610
they was in duffle bags and his big football shaped, uh,

9
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.850
fluffy stuff made with ether. And, uh,

10
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.250
they would have three horns on it or a rattlesnake or four X's on

11
00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:44.240
each bag. And you kinda got to knowing which was which, which,

12
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.520
and they shipped a lot.

13
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.400
<v 2>So, um, and he was just a gentleman. I took the family,</v>

14
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.400
we went one weekend to his ranch or his, uh,

15
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.080
ballet place out near barren ke. And all,

16
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.200
he just treated the family. His family had a, his younger brother wrote,

17
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.150
made a bull fire and we had, uh, skiing and,

18
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.870
uh, little airplanes on floats on, on the water. It was really nice.

19
00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:13.870
And he was really nice.

20
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.870
<v 0>How do you make sense of the tension that a man could be?</v>

21
00:01:20.871 --> 00:01:24.870
A gentleman can have integrity, but also be a murderer? Well.

22
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.780
<v 1>Murder is, is a, is a stronger word than killing.</v>

23
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.340
<v 0>Can you explain the, the, the line, the gray area we're talking about?</v>

24
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.370
I mean,

25
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.860
I've just talking with Jack willing and we talked a lot about killing in the

26
00:01:39.861 --> 00:01:44.300
context of, um, military conflict and the context of war.

27
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.410
So there, there's a line between murder and killing that you can draw. What's,

28
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.930
uh, the line that you're referring to.

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.530
<v 1>It's something similar. If you,</v>

30
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.450
if people shooting at you and you shoot back and kill him, I don't,

31
00:01:56.451 --> 00:02:00.930
that's not murder whatsoever. It's, uh, he's trying to get away or, or out,

32
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.530
outta the situation. But if, uh,

33
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.920
some woman don't pay you and you send to hit man over to,

34
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.160
to kill her and her children, that's, that's, that's murder, that's.

35
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.720
<v 0>Murder. Was Jorge involved in those kinds of things?</v>

36
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.560
<v 1>I don't think so at all. It just, I mean, he was, he was just such a gentleman.</v>

37
00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:20.640
He had, um, a restaurant before and, and he was just smart. I understand that,

38
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.840
uh, the first 10 kilos he sold, he was sitting on a, on a motorcycle in the,

39
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.870
in the sidelines and a part when the DEA come in, he sped away.

40
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.790
So he didn't come back to America. He was just smart. Some people just have,

41
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:33.803
are savvy.

42
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.310
<v 2>And he was such a gentleman and the whole family, the mother and the father,</v>

43
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.350
the two brothers, their sister that I was there when she was kidnapped. And, uh,

44
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.630
finally he kidnapped our, our,

45
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.940
I guess a hundred liters of the Fark and, uh, said,

46
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.260
all right, she don't come back.

47
00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:54.580
None of these are gonna come back &lt;laugh&gt; so they made a deal.
