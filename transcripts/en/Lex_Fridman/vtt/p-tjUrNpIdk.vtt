1
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.790
<v 0>What about, um, Kim, Jon UN Kim.</v>

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:06.623
<v 1>Jon UN. Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.430
<v 0>Is he intentionally evil or is he mind mindlessly</v>

4
00:00:12.431 --> 00:00:15.470
propagating an evil system created by his ancestors?

5
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.390
What's your sense of the man? So.

6
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.350
<v 1>With Kim, your song, I can give him more than thought.</v>

7
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.420
He was a initial true believer of communism,

8
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.700
but then as later he gained the power, he realizing, I think,

9
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.500
I guess back then he thought most of the people are dumb. My individual is dumb.

10
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.100
So therefore I need to make good decision for all of you. Yeah.

11
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.020
That pure arrogance came from out of him. Even that I can tolerate. Okay. Fine.

12
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.850
In Kim, Jon who never like, yeah, fine. He grew up in that system too.

13
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.330
But Kim Jong is very unique.

14
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.650
This guy was educated in Switzerland,

15
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:56.770
in the heart of democracy.

16
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.210
He knew how human beings should be treated as a child.

17
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.080
He went when your child, your brain is very susceptible. Yeah. Right.

18
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.440
You change anybody. Like why the mall was.

19
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.920
So that's like changing young people's minds.

20
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.520
Like that's every revolutionary they do. Right.

21
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.440
They go change young people's minds. First,

22
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.720
this guy was so obsess with the power, him being a God,

23
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.960
even starting in Switzer, didn't change him.

24
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.710
And that's why I think that's a pure evil, you know,

25
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.590
I can't give you more benefit thought to his grandfather and father,

26
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.070
but when it comes Kim, Jon, this is like, what? Pure evil looks like pure,

27
00:01:37.071 --> 00:01:40.030
selfish being. Yeah. That's what it looks like.

28
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.990
<v 0>Is there, is there some sense where he's justifying every,</v>

29
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.500
I think he's doing to himself or do you think there's a psychopathic aspect to

30
00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:50.740
where he enjoys the suffering?

31
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.780
<v 1>I think in his life. Right. I read a lot of, uh, like North Korea,</v>

32
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.340
a lot of CIA documents,

33
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.460
a lot of intelligence people worked there and even like worked in north Korean

34
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.490
capitalists escaped. I, I could hear about them. So Kim, Jon,

35
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.770
when they're born, they treat like gods.

36
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.570
So they never have a sense of them being a human they're like

37
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.090
equal with the others, for them. Like,

38
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.170
if you are just any kind of tool like that, but not only not like, think that,

39
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:23.004
right.

40
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.040
Anybody's a tool like once boxer dies getting slaughtered for my cause mm-hmm

41
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.920
&lt;affirmative&gt; and they do not even feel guilty about it because they don't view

42
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.120
us that you deserve, you are worthy of it. Yeah. That's right.

43
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.320
So it's not like he even fears. He doesn't even recognize that's a suffering.

44
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.000
Like, of course you, you, this is,

45
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:45.280
this is what you do serving me because I am, I am this.

46
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.510
So I think like beyond that, like it's not like suffering, it enters his minds.

47
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.710
He doesn't even think what we go through.

48
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.830
<v 0>Okay. So he thinks there's himself as a, as a God. Yeah.</v>

49
00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.000
And then everybody else is just, uh, tools that, that are disposable. Right.

50
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.760
There was rumors. Several times of him dying. Yeah.

51
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.360
Do you think he is? Um, obviously his health is not good.

52
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.840
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; do you think he will die soon? What happens if Kim,

53
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.000
Jon Nu dies?

54
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.990
<v 1>Why? When he comes to North Korea, anybody knows what they are going.</v>

55
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.950
What Jon does is lie. Right? Nobody knows. I'm sure CIA knows,

56
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.830
but they may never revered that CIA has enough intelligence to can tell

57
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.070
Jon what he is doing.

58
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.190
They just don't assassinate him because you don't see the means of it right now.

59
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.950
<v 0>Because you think they can assassinate him.</v>

60
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.830
<v 1>They can't. They do have ability to assassin.</v>

61
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.940
<v 0>The hell. Do they not assassinate? 'em.</v>

62
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.770
<v 1>Because they don't care.</v>

63
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.420
They don't care about the suffering of 25 million people.

64
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.620
They gotta pay the price. If they assassin games, they gotta.

65
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.820
<v 0>Pay the price. After they'll be financial, there'll be political price to pay.</v>

66
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.420
Of course. It'll it'll anger. China, if.

67
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.380
<v 1>Sorry. Absolutely. That is a huge piece.</v>

68
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.860
<v 0>For them. And then they'll have to deal.</v>

69
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.650
Obviously there'll be financ military consequences of having to deal with the

70
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.610
turmoil, the uncertainty. Yeah. Of the revolutions that will spring up.

71
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.330
<v 1>Yeah. That's the thing like, that's why they don't wanna take that risk.</v>

72
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.610
They don't wanna do anything.

73
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.970
The us now became very passive when they pursue this model values to the

74
00:04:16.971 --> 00:04:17.640
rest of the world.

75
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.930
<v 0>They did the same thing with the Holocaust in the early days.</v>

76
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.480
<v 1>Actually. Yeah. They were like just, they didn't care.</v>

77
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.520
And that's what their always policy has been. They don't care. I mean,

78
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.960
so if Kim Jon dies,

79
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.800
it's gonna be very hard for North Korea to replace anybody in his position.

80
00:04:33.801 --> 00:04:38.760
Because Kims is a brand. It's not just like a leader for us, right? Yeah.

81
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.150
We never rethink of Kim. And with my mind, like,

82
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.630
who's like almost God figure mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; the North Korea is number 10

83
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.230
religions in the world. They copy the Bible. So if you believe that,

84
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.510
if there are people believing the God and just Christ,

85
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.750
how do you not believe the north Korean believe in the same thing?

86
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.900
So Kim son's grandfather and his parents were

87
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.460
Christians. So Kim song was, grew up this like Christian,

88
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.140
like word versus mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. So when he finding his country, he said,

89
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.540
I love my people so much that I'm giving you my son, Kim, Jon, his body dies.

90
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.100
But his spirits with does forever. Who can know how many hair I have,

91
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.490
what I think. And when we suffer,

92
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.090
when we go to paradise with him and when you block every single information

93
00:05:28.091 --> 00:05:30.130
going to country, of course, people gonna believe it.

94
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.290
<v 0>So who would be the successor? If he dies.</v>

95
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.010
<v 1>He has a son, uh, for some born 2009 and not,</v>

96
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.010
not old enough if he dies now. So,

97
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.280
so either his sister might rule for a short amount of time as not like a

98
00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:50.800
leader, but like REPL, like temporary placement.

99
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.360
And then when the son is older enough, he might take it off.

100
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.680
Cuz it's a kingdom that's most likely,

101
00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.960
and China will do everything they can to maintain that status quo for the north

102
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.993
Korean region.

103
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.720
So north Korean people have no option here.

104
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.360
We just needed some leader to courageously come up and do the right thing.

105
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.040
So we're we can't just wait this out. No, we can't.

106
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:18.750
It's not something and take its course and not gonna change.

107
00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.750
Like we not even know that economic freedom does not bring political freedom.

108
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.110
We know in China. Yeah. It doesn't. That's the unique thing about freedom.

109
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.230
You gotta fight for it. Otherwise you don't never get it.

110
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.270
Freedom is something has default.

111
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.300
And if nobody fighting for freedom is not gonna be there.
