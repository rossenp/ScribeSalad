1
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.310
<v 0>Do you have hope that humans will colonize</v>

2
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.830
the, uh, the galaxy. So expand out, become a multi planetary species.

3
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.430
Another way of asking that from a gravitational and a propulsion perspective,

4
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.070
do you think will come up with ways to travel closer to the speed of light or

5
00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:21.710
maybe faster than the speed of light,

6
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.220
which may get a whole heck of a lot easier to, to expand out into the,

7
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.283
into the universe?

8
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.660
<v 1>Yeah. Uh, well, I, I think, um,</v>

9
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.460
you know, we're not, that's a very futuristic,

10
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.420
I think we're not that far from being able to make a one way trip to

11
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.770
Mars. That's a that's then a question of, uh,

12
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.770
whether people are willing to send somebody on a one-way trip, but oh.

13
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:55.683
<v 0>I think they are.</v>

14
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.890
I think there's a lot of the explorers burnt bright within the parts. Yeah.

15
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.880
A lot people willing to die, so, so, but the opportunity to, to a new territory.

16
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:05.780
Yeah.

17
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.600
<v 1>So, uh, you know, with this,</v>

18
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.800
this recent landing on Mars is pretty impressive.

19
00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:15.400
They have a little helicopter, they can fly around. You can imagine,

20
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.280
you can imagine in the, not too distant future that you could have.

21
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.430
I don't think civilizations, colonizing, I can envision, but I,

22
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.470
I can envision something more like the south pole, we haven't colonized,

23
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.390
uh, Antarctica, cuz it's, it's all ice and cold and so forth,

24
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.950
but we have, uh, stations.

25
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.910
So we have a station that's self-sustaining at the south pole that I've been

26
00:01:42.911 --> 00:01:45.660
there. It has. Wow. Really? Yeah.

27
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.140
<v 0>What's that like? Uh,</v>

28
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.340
and &lt;laugh&gt; because that there's parallels there to go to.

29
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.580
<v 1>Mars. It's fantastic.</v>

30
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.980
<v 0>It's what's the journey like &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

31
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.820
<v 1>The journey involves going? Uh, the south pole station is, uh,</v>

32
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.220
run in the us by, by the national science foundation. Mm.

33
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.130
I went because I was on the, uh,

34
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.690
national science board that runs the national science foundation.

35
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.810
And so you get a V I P trip if you're healthy enough to the south pole to

36
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.210
see it, uh, which I took, uh,

37
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.370
you fly from the us to Australia to, to, uh, uh,

38
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.640
Christ church in Australia, Southern Australia. And, um,

39
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.840
from there you fly to McMurdo station,

40
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.040
which is on the coast and it's the station with about a thousand people,

41
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.960
right on the coast of Antarctica. Uh,

42
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.680
it's about a seven or eight hour flight and they can't predict the weather.

43
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.230
So when,

44
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.310
when I flew from Christ church to McMurdo station,

45
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.150
they tell you in advance, you do it in a military aircraft,

46
00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.440
they tell you in advance that they can't predict whether they can land cuz they

47
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:02.600
have to land on, uh, that's an reassuring. Yeah.

48
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.600
And so about halfway, the pilot got on and said, uh,

49
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.360
sorry, this is, uh, they call it a boomerang flight, you know,

50
00:03:11.361 --> 00:03:13.120
boomerang goes out, boom, and goes back.

51
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.360
So we had to stay a little while and Christchurch,

52
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.190
but then we eventually went to make Myrtle station and then, uh,

53
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.990
flew to the south pole. The south pole itself is,

54
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.230
uh, when I was there, it was minus 51 degrees that was summer.

55
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.990
Uh, it, uh, uh, zero humidity.

56
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.500
And um, uh,

57
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.380
and it's about 11,000 feet altitude

58
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.900
because it's never warm enough for anything to melt.

59
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.540
So it doesn't snow very much, but it's about 11,000 feet of snow pack.

60
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.890
So you land in a place that's high altitude, um,

61
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.610
cold as could be and uh, dry and incredibly dry,

62
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.090
uh, which means you have a physical adjustment. Uh, the, uh,

63
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.450
place itself is, uh, it's fantastic.

64
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.130
They have this great station there. They, they do astronomy at the south pole.

65
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.040
<v 0>Nature wide. Is, is it beautiful or it is what's the experience like?</v>

66
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.600
Or is it like visiting any town?

67
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.000
<v 1>No, it's very small. There's only, um, less than a hundred people there,</v>

68
00:04:31.001 --> 00:04:32.960
even when I was there, you know,

69
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.520
there were about 50 or 60 there and in the winter there's less half of that

70
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.360
there, winter when yeah.

71
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:41.550
<v 0>It gets.</v>

72
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.950
<v 1>Real cold. It gets really cold. Yeah. And, uh, but it's, but it's,</v>

73
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.430
it's a station and I, and I think, and that's, I mean,

74
00:04:51.431 --> 00:04:55.070
we, haven't gone beyond that, uh, on the coast of Antarctica,

75
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.230
they have greenhouse and they're, self-sustaining in McMurdo station,

76
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.140
but we haven't really settled more than that kind of thing

77
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.540
in Antarctica, which is a big, uh,

78
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.820
a country or, you know, uh, big plot,

79
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.260
a big piece of land. So I don't,

80
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.340
I can't envision kind of colonizing it,

81
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.810
people be living so much as much as I can see, uh,

82
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.490
of the equivalent of the south pole.

83
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.770
<v 0>Station. Well, in, in the computing world, there's a idea of, um, you know,</v>

84
00:05:32.771 --> 00:05:37.130
backing up your data and then you wanna do offsite backup, uh, you know,

85
00:05:37.131 --> 00:05:40.770
to make sure that if the whole thing burn, if your whole house burns down,

86
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.600
that you can have a back offsite of the data.

87
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.480
I think the difference between Antarctica and, um,

88
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.920
and Mars is Mars is a offsite backup that if we have nuclear war,

89
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.920
whatever the heck might happen here on earth,

90
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.880
it'd be nice to have a backup elsewhere. And, uh,

91
00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.840
it'd be nice to have a large enough colony where we sent a variety of people

92
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.960
except like, uh, a few silly astronauts and, and suits,

93
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.760
you know, have a actual, vibrant, um, get a few,

94
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.640
get a few musicians and artists up there, get a few, uh,

95
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.920
maybe like one or two computer scientists. Those are essential,

96
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.590
maybe even a physicist.

97
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:19.830
<v 1>I'm not sure, you know, maybe not.</v>

98
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.030
So that comes back to something you talked about earlier, which is fair,

99
00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.830
the paradox families' paradox because you talked about having to escape or yeah.

100
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.790
But, and so the missing one,

101
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.870
one number you don't know how to use in fairies calculation or Drake who's done

102
00:06:36.871 --> 00:06:40.460
a better is how long do civilizations last? Yeah.

103
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.380
Before they are, we, you know,

104
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.900
we've barely gotten to where we can communicate with electricity and magnetism

105
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.380
and maybe we'll wipe ourselves out pretty.

106
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.060
<v 0>Soon. So are you hopeful in general?</v>

107
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.980
Like you think we've got another couple hundred years at least. Yeah.

108
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.933
Or are you worried?

109
00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.690
<v 1>I, well, I, no, I'm, I'm, I'm hopeful,</v>

110
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.930
but I don't know if I'm hopeful in the long term. Hmm. You know, if you say,

111
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:11.010
you know, uh, are we able to,

112
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.930
to go for another couple thousand years? I'm not sure. I, you know,

113
00:07:15.931 --> 00:07:18.440
think we have little where we,

114
00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:23.040
where we started the fact that we can do things that don't allow us to kind of

115
00:07:23.041 --> 00:07:25.720
keep going, or there can be, whether it, you know,

116
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:30.400
ends up being a virus that we create or ends up being the equivalent of nuclear

117
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.480
war or something else. Uh, uh,

118
00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:34.800
it's not clear that we can control things well enough.
