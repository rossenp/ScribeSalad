1
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.040
<v 0>From an evolutionary perspective as a feature or a bug, our, uh,</v>

2
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:11.240
natural sort of tendency to form tribes.

3
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.320
<v 1>So what's a bug.</v>

4
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.840
<v 0>Oh, sorry. This is a computer, uh, programming analogy. Um,</v>

5
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.040
meaning like

6
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.190
it would be more beneficial.

7
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.790
Is it beneficial or detrimental to form tribes from an

8
00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:30.710
evolutionary perspective?

9
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.790
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. But, but.</v>

10
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.590
<v 0>But what does it, what does it mean? What does a bug mean?</v>

11
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.350
<v 1>Yes. Right. I mean.</v>

12
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.350
<v 0>Well, yeah, like where's evolution going anyway. It's.</v>

13
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.230
<v 1>Beneficial from, you know,</v>

14
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.140
it's beneficial in the sense that it evolved by natural selection. Yes. Uh,

15
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.580
to be, to benefit the individuals who did it. Yes. But if you,

16
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.660
if by bug you mean something that from the point of view of the species,

17
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.140
it would be great if you could just wipe this out. Right.

18
00:00:54.141 --> 00:00:58.260
Because the species would somehow do better. Yes. As a result then yes. But,

19
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.140
but then, you know, males are a bug &lt;laugh&gt;.

20
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.980
<v 0>Uh, come on now. It's, uh,</v>

21
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.850
there's some nice things to males speaking as a male.

22
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.770
<v 1>The fact that there are some nice things to males doesn't mean that they're not</v>

23
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.170
bugs, you know, maybe they're quite nice bugs,

24
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.890
but it'll be much better for the species as a whole,

25
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.090
not to have to have males who impose this violence on the species as a whole.

26
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:24.563
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

27
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.000
As somebody who practiced controlled violence and doing a lot of martial arts.

28
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.880
Yeah. It, uh, I'm not sure. It,

29
00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:35.240
it does seem kind of fun to have this kind of controlled violence,

30
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.880
also sports also. I mean, the question of conflict in general,

31
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.360
I guess that's the deeper question.

32
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.670
Don't you think there's some value to conflict &lt;affirmative&gt; for the

33
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.630
improvement of society for progress that,

34
00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:54.190
that this tension between tribes isn't this like,

35
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.230
uh, experiment, a continued experiment,

36
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.390
we conduct with each other and to figure out what is a better world to build.

37
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.991
Like,

38
00:02:01.991 --> 00:02:06.940
you need that conflict of good ideas and bad ideas is to

39
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.500
go to war with each other.

40
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.980
It's like the United States with the 50 states and the it's the laboratory of

41
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.460
ideas. Don't you think that is again, feature versus bug?

42
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.300
Um, it, this kind of conflict,

43
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.250
when it doesn't get out of hand is actually ultimately progress productive

44
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.223
for better world.

45
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.050
<v 1>Well, what do you mean by conflict? I mean,</v>

46
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.690
you can have conflict in the sense of people have different ideas about the

47
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.090
solution to a problem. And so their ideas are in conflict.

48
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.810
They can sit down at it and, uh, on a log and,

49
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.560
and chat about it and then decide, okay, you're right. Or I'm wrong or whatever.

50
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.560
Um, but, but if my conflict, uh,

51
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.920
you mean a great idea to build a nuclear bomb and set that off,

52
00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.680
uh, then no, you know, I,

53
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.160
I don't see why it's a good idea to have all this violence.

54
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.240
<v 0>Yeah. There's I, I wonder,</v>

55
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.480
I mean, it's not a good idea,

56
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.320
but I wonder if human history would evolve the way it did without the violence.

57
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.110
<v 1>Oh, I'm sure you're you're right. It pro would be, uh,</v>

58
00:03:19.111 --> 00:03:23.510
humans would not evolved in, in the sense that we have, but I would hope that,

59
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.910
uh, the course of, uh,

60
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.750
violence in evolution, uh, will continue in the way it has.

61
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.390
So, you know, there's all sorts of indications, um,

62
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.540
that the importance of violence has been reduced over

63
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.140
time. And, you know,

64
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:47.340
this has made famous Stephen Pinker's book,

65
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.180
but others have written about it too. Um, that the,

66
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.300
the frequency of, uh, death from violence in every country,

67
00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.210
you look at, uh, it has been declining. That's just great. And so,

68
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:01.491
you know,

69
00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:05.490
the amazing thing about this is that even when you take the death due to the

70
00:04:05.491 --> 00:04:07.250
first world war and the second world war,

71
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.290
the 20th century appears to have been statistically meaning

72
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.570
rates of death per individual, um, the, uh,

73
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:18.850
least violent in history.

74
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.760
So we, haven't got very far down the course to nonviolence,

75
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.360
but I don't see why we shouldn't just carry on doing it.

76
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.080
I think it's ridiculous, frankly, you know, uh, uh, excuse my frankness, uh,

77
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.520
to, to say that, uh, the violence is a good thing. Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, um,

78
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.870
I think that it would be a wonderful concept if we could evolve somehow world,

79
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.670
you know, 3000 years from now, uh,

80
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.230
where violence is really regarded as, uh,

81
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.150
simply appalling and that, you know,

82
00:04:49.151 --> 00:04:53.070
they look back on our time and can't believe what we were doing.

83
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.830
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. But of course, violence takes a lot of different shapes as we get.</v>

84
00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.823
Um,

85
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.940
As we start to think deeper and deeper about living beings on earth,

86
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.140
for example, the violence we commit and the torture would commit to animals.

87
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.940
And then perhaps down the line,

88
00:05:11.941 --> 00:05:15.980
as we talked offline about is with robots and that kind of thing.

89
00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:19.140
So there there's just so many ways to commit violence to others.

90
00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.250
And some people now talk about violence in the space of, of ideas,

91
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.850
which of course,

92
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.730
to me at least is a bit of a silly notion relative to use that same V

93
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.490
word for the space of ideas versus actual physical violence.

94
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.650
But it may be that long time from now,

95
00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:40.090
we see that even violence in the space of ideas is, is, is quite,

96
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.360
uh, manifestation of that kind of violence. And so it,

97
00:05:44.361 --> 00:05:48.600
it is interesting where this is headed and I think you're absolutely right.

98
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.960
Uh, a world, a non-violent world does seem like a better world.

99
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.560
I wonder if the constraints on resources somehow make that world

100
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.240
more and more difficult, especially as we run out of.

101
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.640
<v 1>Resources. Well, it's gotta be very,</v>

102
00:06:03.641 --> 00:06:06.400
very different from what we're doing nowadays. And, and it's,

103
00:06:06.401 --> 00:06:08.480
it's unimaginably different. If we could imagine it,

104
00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:10.280
then maybe we could work towards it at the moment.

105
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:11.600
Nobody knows how to work towards it.

106
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.880
<v 0>Well, that's kind of the stories of humans as we,</v>

107
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.280
we don't really know the future.

108
00:06:15.281 --> 00:06:20.110
We're trying to trying ad ho kind of develop it as we go and

109
00:06:20.111 --> 00:06:22.550
sometimes get into trouble yeah. As the.

110
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.270
<v 1>Violence. But it, you know, George Orwell's vision in 1984 was of, uh,</v>

111
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:32.190
of, of, you know, two or three world powers each so powerful that nobody could,

112
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.380
could diminish the, could, could destroy the other. Um,

113
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.300
but the notion of, uh, an evolutionarily stable relationship among,

114
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.780
uh, heavily armed world powers just does not seem, uh,

115
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.660
as though it it's reasonable at all. There's to say,

116
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:56.820
uh, you know, we've,

117
00:06:56.821 --> 00:07:01.450
we've now got out 170 or 190 nations in the world,

118
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.050
uh, dominated by a few big ones, uh,

119
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.090
all with arms pointing at each other.

120
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:13.650
And the notion that we could just carry on having peace talks and making

121
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.890
sure that, uh, these arms, uh, don't get, uh, involved in,

122
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.920
in some kind of massive congregation, uh, seems incredibly optimistic.

123
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:28.560
Some kind of major change has to happen, uh, whereby you know,

124
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.720
and some people would like to see all the weapons go, that'd be great. You know,

125
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.520
I, I'm a member of that, that sort of group that tries to, to see that happen.

126
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:41.110
It's gonna very difficult to see it happen. And, um, another kind of concept is,

127
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:45.590
uh, the nations themselves will dissolve and will become, uh, one,

128
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:47.643
one government.

129
00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:53.150
That itself is a terrifying vision because the capacity for abuse

130
00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:58.110
by a single world power would be so problematic. And in addition,

131
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:02.140
how do you get there without a war in the first place? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so,

132
00:08:02.141 --> 00:08:07.140
you know, at the moment we, we have no reasonable kind of, uh, future in mind,

133
00:08:07.141 --> 00:08:10.020
but I'm sure it's there somewhere. It's just that we haven't yet to find it.

134
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.740
<v 0>And a lot of people like in the cryptocurrency space argue that, uh,</v>

135
00:08:13.741 --> 00:08:18.660
you can create decentralized societies if you take away the power from states

136
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.290
to find the monetary system. So they argue, like if you give, if,

137
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:27.410
if you make the monetary systems such that it's disjointed from anyone,

138
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.210
the control of one individual, any one government,

139
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.730
then that might be a way to form sort of ad ho decentralized society, just,

140
00:08:34.731 --> 00:08:38.970
they just pop up all over the place. That's a really interesting technological,

141
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:44.600
uh, solution to how to remove the overreach of power from governments.

142
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.640
<v 1>Yes. Right. Absolutely. And, and it may well be that, uh,</v>

143
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.440
that the future will emerge outta some sort of quite surprising mm-hmm

144
00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.920
&lt;affirmative&gt; direction, uh, like that.
