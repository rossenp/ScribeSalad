00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.830
<v 0>Do you think there's a limit to the kind of beautiful complex systems we can</v>

2
00:00:06.831 --> 00:00:10.790
build with this kind of modular design is like,

3
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.870
uh, you know, if we build increasingly more complicated,

4
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:19.830
you can think of like the internet. Okay. Let's scale it down.

5
00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:21.550
<v 2>Well, you can think of like social network,</v>

6
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.500
like Twitter mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; as on computing system.

7
00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:29.300
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and, but those are little modules. Yeah. Right.

8
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.140
<v 1>But it's built on, it's built on so many components,</v>

9
00:00:33.141 --> 00:00:36.540
nobody at Twitter even understands. Right. So that's so,

10
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.420
so if an alien showed up and looked at Twitter,

11
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.140
you wouldn't just see Twitter as a beautiful, simple thing that everybody uses,

12
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.100
which is really big.

13
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.450
<v 2>You would see the network, it runs on the fiber objects, the datas transported,</v>

14
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.810
the computers, the whole thing is so bloody complicated.

15
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.770
Nobody Twitter understands it. And so I, I think.

16
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.570
<v 0>That's what the alien would see. So yeah,</v>

17
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.690
if an alien showed up and looked at Twitter or looked at the various different

18
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.210
network systems that you could see on earth.

19
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.600
<v 1>So imagine there were really smart and it could comprehend the whole thing.</v>

20
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.880
And then they sort of, you know, evaluated a human and thought,

21
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.400
this is really interesting. No human on this planet comprehends the system.

22
00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:14.234
They built.

23
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.640
<v 0>No individual. Well, they even see individual humans. That's an in like we,</v>

24
00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:21.240
humans are very human centric, entity centric.

25
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.910
And so we think of us as the organ,

26
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.830
as the central organism and the networks as just the connection of organisms,

27
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.110
but from a perspective of an, from an outside perspective, it seems like.

28
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.790
<v 1>Yeah, I get it. We're the ants. And they'd see the, an.</v>

29
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.550
<v 0>Colony, the, an colony. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Or the result of production of the,</v>

30
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.220
an colony, which is like cities and yeah. It's, it's, uh,

31
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.100
yeah, in that sense, humans are pretty impressive.

32
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.460
<v 2>The modularity that we're able to and the, and how robust,</v>

33
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.140
where it's noise and mutation and all that kind of stuff. Well.

34
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.980
<v 1>That's cuz it's stress tested all the time. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt;, you know,</v>

35
00:01:58.981 --> 00:02:01.660
you build all these cities with buildings and you get earthquakes occasionally

36
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.540
and wars, you know, some, you know, wars, earthquakes.

37
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.570
<v 0>Viruses, every once in a while, &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

38
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.610
<v 1>You know, changes in business plans for, you know,</v>

39
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.810
like shipping or something like, like as long as it's all stress test,

40
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.490
then it, it keeps adapting to the, the situation. So the

41
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.810
that's a curious phenomena.
