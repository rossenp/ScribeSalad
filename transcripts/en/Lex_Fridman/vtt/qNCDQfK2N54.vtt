00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.600
<v 0>At the risk of, uh, asking the rolling stones to play satisfaction.</v>

2
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.600
Let me ask you about the origin story of Instagram. Sure.

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.240
So maybe some context you like we were talking about offline grew up in

4
00:00:14.241 --> 00:00:15.074
Massachusetts,

5
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.800
learned computer programming there liked to play doom two &lt;laugh&gt;, uh,

6
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:22.600
worked at a vinyl record store. Then you went to Stanford,

7
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.390
turned down Mr. Uh,

8
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.910
mark Zuckerberg and Facebook went to Florence to study photography.

9
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.390
Those are just some random,

10
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.270
beautiful impossibly brief glimpses into a life.

11
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:36.550
So let me ask again,

12
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.510
can you take me through the origin story of Instagram given.

13
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.390
<v 1>That context? Yeah. I mean, you basically set it up. Um, all right. So, uh,</v>

14
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.780
we have a fair amount of time, so I'll go into some detail,

15
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.100
but basically what I'll say is, um,

16
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.860
Instagram started out of a company actually called bourbon and it was

17
00:00:54.861 --> 00:00:57.620
spelled B U R B N mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. And, uh,

18
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.140
a couple things were happening at the time. So if we zoom back to 2010,

19
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.170
not a lot of people remember what was happen in the.com world then, uh,

20
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.610
but check-in apps were all the rage mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so what's the check-in

21
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.290
app, uh, Gowa four square, hot potato.

22
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.890
<v 0>So I'm at a place I'm gonna tell the world that I'm at this place. That's right.</v>

23
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.690
What's, what's the idea behind this kind of app, by the way.

24
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.450
<v 1>You know what, I'm gonna answer that,</v>

25
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.000
but through what Instagram became and why I believe Instagram replaced them.

26
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.160
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so the whole idea was to share with the world what you were

27
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:33.880
doing specifically with your friends, right? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um,

28
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.160
but there were all the rage and Foursquare was getting all the press.

29
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.720
And I remember sitting around saying, Hey, I want to build something,

30
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:40.920
but I don't know what I want to build.

31
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.070
What if I built a better version of Foursquare? And I asked myself,

32
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.830
well, why don't I like Foursquare? Or how could it be improved? Right. Um,

33
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.470
and basically I sat down and I said,

34
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.190
I think that if you have a few extra features, it might be enough.

35
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.990
One of which happened to be posting a photo of where you were mm-hmm

36
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.630
&lt;affirmative&gt; there were some others, it turns out that wasn't enough.

37
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.340
My co-founder joined. We were going, going to attack, uh, you know,

38
00:02:07.341 --> 00:02:11.020
Foursquare and the likes and, and try to build something interesting. Um,

39
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.940
and no one used it, no one cared because it wasn't enough. It wasn't,

40
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.940
it wasn't different enough. Right.

41
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.260
So one day we were sitting down and we asked ourselves, okay,

42
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.700
come to Jesus moment. Are we gonna do this startup?

43
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.050
And if we're going to, we, can't what we're currently doing.

44
00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:29.250
We have to switch it up. So what do people love the most?

45
00:02:29.251 --> 00:02:33.410
So we sat down and we wrote out three things that we thought people

46
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.250
uniquely loved about our product, that weren't in. Other products.

47
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.770
Photos happened to be the top one. So sharing a photo of what you were doing,

48
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.080
where you were at the moment was not something products let you really,

49
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.280
Facebook was like post an album of your vacation from two weeks ago.

50
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.160
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; right. Twitter allowed you to post a photo,

51
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.200
but their feed was primarily text and they didn't show the photo in line,

52
00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.880
or at least I don't think they did at the time.

53
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.480
So even though it seems totally stupid and obvious to us

54
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.760
now at the moment,

55
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.280
then posting a photo of what you were doing at the moment was like not a thing

56
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.133
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

57
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.080
So we decided to go after that because we noticed that people who used our

58
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.430
service, the one thing they happened, like the most was posting a photo.

59
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.390
So that was the beginning of Instagram. And yes,

60
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.750
like we went through and we added filters and there's a bunch of stories around

61
00:03:26.751 --> 00:03:30.390
that. But the origin of this was that we were trying to be a check-in app,

62
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.590
realized that no one wanted another check-in app. It became a photo sharing app,

63
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.790
but one that was much more about what you're doing and where you are.

64
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.180
And that's why when I say, I think we replaced check-in apps,

65
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.900
it became a check-in via a photo rather than saying your

66
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.260
location. And then ally adding a photo.
