00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.960
<v 0>I don't know if you're familiar with Ernest Becker work and all the philosophies</v>

2
00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:11.790
around there about the fear of death and how

3
00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:14.010
the fear of our own mortality,

4
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.430
our awareness of our own mortality and it's fear as

5
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.520
in case of Vernice Becker, uh, is, uh,

6
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.830
a significant component in the psychology in the way we humans

7
00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:31.050
develop our understanding of the world.

8
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.480
So what are your thoughts in the

9
00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:37.560
context of religion,

10
00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:42.030
or maybe in the context of your own mind about the role of death in

11
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:44.910
life? Our fear of death in life.

12
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.120
And are you afraid of death?

13
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.040
<v 1>We cover everything in this podcast covered.</v>

14
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.650
Wow. Okay. Um,

15
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.930
I Sue happen to have benefited perhaps

16
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.420
from living with an older brother who seemingly had no fear of death

17
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.920
while growing up and he did everything. Okay.

18
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.690
So he was, he climbed mountains. He was a rock climber.

19
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.430
He jumped out of airplanes.

20
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.810
Of course he had to be a Greenbrae and go into the special forces where that

21
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.790
type of thing is a requirement. Right. And so,

22
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.720
because of that,

23
00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:34.130
I did a lot of things outside of my comfort zone and which probably I shouldn't

24
00:01:34.131 --> 00:01:37.940
have done and hope, hope to goodness. My kids don't do them. Yeah. Okay.

25
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.240
Okay. So do you, so I do I fear death. Um, I think about death a lot,

26
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.380
actually. Um, you may not know this about me, but in my field,

27
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.670
I was the head. I was the co-chair of the death panel.

28
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.340
It's called the death panel. There was like,

29
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.870
it's the panel to think about death in religious studies.

30
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.810
Um, and I was at for many years, you've thought about it a bit a bit. Let's see.

31
00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:10.610
I think that people are a little too confident. I think about life in general,

32
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.930
that they're going to kind of live all the time and not die. I happened to,

33
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.501
I mean,

34
00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:19.970
I hate to say it I'm super positive and most people would consider me to be

35
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.800
too happy almost. Right.

36
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.090
And so it's odd then that I spent a lot of time thinking about death,

37
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.060
but I wonder if there's a connection there. Yeah. I'm happy to be alive. Right.

38
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.470
<v 0>That's kind of what the thinking about death does,</v>

39
00:02:33.471 --> 00:02:37.100
is it makes you appreciate the days that you do have. Yeah. It's a,

40
00:02:37.101 --> 00:02:41.090
it's a weird controversy. I tend to believe that, um,

41
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.860
the fact that this life ends gives each day, um,

42
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.020
a significant amount of meaning. So I don't know, uh,

43
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.900
it seems like an important feature of life.

44
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.900
It's not like a bug as it seems like a feature that it ends,

45
00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.680
but it's a strange feature. I wish.

46
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.630
<v 1>I call the good stuff. You wish it wouldn't. Then we know it's interesting, Lex.</v>

47
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.130
And I do point this out to my students because we cover in a lot of the basic

48
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:12.550
studies courses I teach, we cover all religions or as many as we can,

49
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:15.970
like the major religions. And so you take Hinduism for example,

50
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.910
and now this is an ancient religion. Okay.

51
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.780
So you and I are here talking about how we enjoy living in life and things like

52
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:23.411
that. Well,

53
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:28.090
the goal of Hinduism is basically never to get reincarnated again is basically

54
00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:31.090
to not live okay. And to get off samskara,

55
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.460
which is the wheel of life and death to escape the whole. Yeah, exactly.

56
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.460
Can think of that. Conditions are so different that you and I,

57
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.900
and my students are happy to be alive, but there, back in the day, you know,

58
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.440
thousands of years ago when they wrote, when they actually didn't write it,

59
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:51.190
they spoke the Vedas, which were the sacred traditions of India.

60
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.390
They want it off. They didn't want to come back. Life was terrible.

61
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.560
That's what people don't have the adequate understanding of history.

62
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.360
That for the majority of people, life is really hard. Right.

63
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.410
And you and I are, and your audience among the lucky

64
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.420
yeah. That we actually life like life. We want to live

65
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.110
most of the time. Yeah. Most of the time.
