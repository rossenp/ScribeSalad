00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.150
<v 0>What do you think is more special intelligence or consciousness?</v>

2
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.510
<v 1>I think consciousness. And I think that there's, um,</v>

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.110
a deep connection between these ideas. They are distinct,

4
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:17.630
but they're deeply connected. But look, I mean, to me, and to of course,

5
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.030
many philosophers actually coined a name for this,

6
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.790
the hard problem of consciousness, you know, David Chalmers and others,

7
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.220
as a physicist,

8
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.260
I look at out the world and I see it's particles governed by

9
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.340
physical law. We can name them. You know, we got electrons,

10
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.700
we got corks that come in various flavors and so forth.

11
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.540
We have a list of ingredients that science has revealed,

12
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.370
and we have a list of laws that seemingly govern those ingredients. And,

13
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.970
and nowhere in there is there even a hint that when you put

14
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.490
those particles together in the right way,

15
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.490
an inner world should turn on. And it's not only that there's no hint,

16
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.970
it's insane. I mean, it's ridiculous.

17
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.280
How could it be that a thoughtless, passionless,

18
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.680
emotionless particle when grouped together with

19
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.840
compatriots somehow can yield something so deeply foreign

20
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.280
to the nature of the ingredients themselves. So, so answering that question,

21
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.110
I think is among the deepest to most difficult questions that we face.

22
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.590
<v 0>Do you think it is in fact a really hard problem?</v>

23
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.310
Or is it possible?

24
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.830
I think you mentioned your book that it's just like a,

25
00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:41.350
almost like a side effect. It's an emergent thing. That's like, oh, it's nice.

26
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.710
It's like a nice little feature. &lt;laugh&gt;.

27
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.460
<v 1>Yeah. Well, I mean, when people use the phrase hard problem, I mean,</v>

28
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.500
they mean in a somewhat technical sense that it's trying to explain

29
00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:57.300
something that seems fundamentally unavailable to third

30
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.380
party objective analysis, right?

31
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.500
I'm the only one that can get inside my head. And I can tell you a lot,

32
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.850
not about what's happening inside my head right now,

33
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.090
it's reflected and what I'm saying,

34
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.450
and you can try to deduce things about what's going on in the top of my head,

35
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:14.770
but you don't have access to it. And the way that I do.

36
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.770
And so it seems like a fundamentally different kind of problem from the ones

37
00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:22.930
that we have successfully dealt with over the course of centuries and science,

38
00:02:22.931 --> 00:02:25.610
where we look at the motion of the moon, everybody can look,

39
00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:28.160
every can measure it. We look at, you know,

40
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.520
the properties of hydrogen when you shine, lasers on,

41
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.360
everybody can look at the data and understand it.

42
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.600
And so it seems like a fundamentally different problem. And in that sense,

43
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.120
it seems like it is hard mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; relative to the others.

44
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.030
But I do think ultimately that the explanation will be as you

45
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.830
recount, I think that a hundred years from now, or maybe it's a thousand,

46
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.270
it's hard to predict the time scale for developments,

47
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.200
but I think we'll get to a place where we'll look back and kind of smile at

48
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.440
those folks in the 20th century and before 21st century and before who

49
00:03:04.441 --> 00:03:09.360
thought consciousness was so incredibly mysterious when the reality of it

50
00:03:09.361 --> 00:03:10.194
is, eh,

51
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.720
it's just a thing that happens when particles come together and,

52
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.440
and however mysterious that feels right now.

53
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.470
I think for instance, when we start to build conscious systems, you know,

54
00:03:22.471 --> 00:03:23.350
things that, you know,

55
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.030
you're more familiar with than I am when we start to build these artificial

56
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.190
systems and those systems report to us, I'm feeling sad. You know,

57
00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:34.910
I'm feeling anxious. Yeah. There's a world going on inside here.

58
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.940
I think the mystery of consciousness will just begin to Eva. Right? Well.

59
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.860
<v 0>It's first of all, beautifully put, and I agree with you completely,</v>

60
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.540
just the way you said it it'll begin to evaporate.

61
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.420
I have B built quite a few robots and have had them do emotion,

62
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.060
emotional type things. And it's immediate that exactly what you're saying.

63
00:03:58.061 --> 00:04:02.770
This kind of mystery of conscious starts to evaporate that the

64
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.250
kind of need to truly understand,

65
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.490
to solve the hard problem of consciousness like disappears because, well,

66
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.170
I don't really care if I understand or can solve the hard problem of

67
00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:18.530
consciousness, that thing sure. As heck looks consci. You know,

68
00:04:18.531 --> 00:04:20.680
I feel like that way, when I interact with a dog,

69
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.520
I don't need to solve the problem of consciousness to,

70
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.000
to be able to interact and, uh,

71
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.720
richly enjoy the experience with this other living, being obviously,

72
00:04:33.721 --> 00:04:36.720
same thing with other humans. I don't need to fully understand it.

73
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.030
And there's some aspect, maybe this is a little bit too engineer focused,

74
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.790
but there's some aspect in which it feels like consciousness is just a nice

75
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.670
trick to help us communicate with each other.

76
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.350
It sounds ridiculous to say, but sort of, uh,

77
00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.310
the ability to experience the world is very useful in a

78
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:04.580
subjective sense is very useful to put yourself in that world

79
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.180
and to be able to describe the experience to others. Yeah.

80
00:05:08.181 --> 00:05:11.780
It could be just a social and the merge, obviously, animals,

81
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.300
the sort of more primitive animals might experience consciousness in some more

82
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.293
primitive way,

83
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.170
but this kind of rich subjective experience that we think about out as humans,

84
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.010
I think is probably deeply coupled like language and poetry.

85
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.170
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; yeah. That resonates with my view as well. I mean, there's a scientist.</v>

86
00:05:31.171 --> 00:05:34.690
Maybe you've spoken to him, Michael Graciano from Princeton. Yeah. He, um,

87
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.650
he's developed ideas of consciousness that look,

88
00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:40.290
I don't think they solve the problem,

89
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.200
but I think they do illuminate in an interesting way where basically

90
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.600
we are not aware of all the underlying

91
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.760
physiochemical processes that make our brains and our inner worlds

92
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.280
tick the way they do.

93
00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.840
And because of that dissociation between sensation and the

94
00:06:01.841 --> 00:06:05.160
physics of it and the chemistry of it and the biology of it,

95
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.520
it feels like our minds and our inner worlds are just untethered,

96
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.560
like floating somewhere in this gray matter inside of our heads.

97
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.790
And the way I like to think of it is like, look, you know, if, um, if,

98
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.110
if, if you were in a dark room, right. And,

99
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.790
and I had blown the dark paint on my fingers,

100
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.550
so all you saw was my fingers dancing around. There'd be something mysterious.

101
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.230
How, how could those fingers be doing that? And then you turn a light realize,

102
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.950
oh, there's this arm underlying it. And that's the,

103
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.140
a deep physical connection explains it all.

104
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.980
And I think that's what we're missing.

105
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.380
The deep physical connection between what's happening up here and what is

106
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:50.060
responsible for it in a physical, chemical, biological way.

107
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.780
And so to me that at least gives me some understanding of why consciousness

108
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:58.890
feels so mysterious because we are suppressing all of the underlying

109
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.450
science that ultimately is responsible for it.

110
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:04.770
And one day we will reveal that more fully.

111
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:09.370
And I think that will help us tether this experience to something quite tangible

112
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.930
in the world.
