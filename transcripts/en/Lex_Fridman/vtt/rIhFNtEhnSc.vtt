00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:03.873
<v 0>In terms of wisdom,</v>

2
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.620
is there mechanisms by which you kind of observe the negative thoughts

3
00:00:09.621 --> 00:00:11.780
and let them go. So you have, uh,

4
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.740
people like the David Goggins who kind of, they,

5
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.420
he seems to almost like separate his mind into there's the weak

6
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.850
David that he hates. And then there's this strong one. I mean,

7
00:00:25.851 --> 00:00:28.210
there's like a very contentious relationship there.

8
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.570
<v 2>Uh, so he basically says like,</v>

9
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.130
I refuse to be that person and he's almost like angry at that person.

10
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.970
He's almost like sometimes literally yelling at that person,

11
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.610
the weak version of themselves.

12
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.250
And then there's another more sort of Sam Harey approach,

13
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.600
which is like, just observe the thought and let it go.

14
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.680
Maybe knowing that this too shall pass, like,

15
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.360
no matter what it,

16
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.080
this moment will not last forever and kind of sort of accepting the natural flow

17
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.520
of things and taking one step at a time and allowing whatever the negativity,

18
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.390
whatever the pain you're experiencing, just to, even if it means a death March,

19
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.910
which one is more effective for you, which one, like,

20
00:01:09.911 --> 00:01:13.150
would you say generally speaking to the population is more effective?

21
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.710
<v 1>Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah, that's a really good question. It, it,</v>

22
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.310
it's probably unique to the individual. I wouldn't argue that, you know,

23
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.190
David is finding success with his approach.

24
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.660
&lt;laugh&gt; some may, it's an extreme version. Uh, you know,

25
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.180
Sam has obviously thought about these things and, and, uh, really probably,

26
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.900
you know,

27
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.060
I see those guys as kind of two ends of the spectrum and just the way that they

28
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:38.900
kind of come across in general, where like,

29
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.180
David's like really at you a kind of high energy,

30
00:01:41.181 --> 00:01:43.900
and Sam's kind of this calming soft presence,

31
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.090
and he's just gonna slowly methodically lay it all out there.

32
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.250
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and I think there's value on in both of those.

33
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.090
I think most people are probably gonna get a benefit from pulling some from

34
00:01:55.091 --> 00:01:56.890
each, I mean, there's times where,

35
00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.850
where I need a kick in the and then it's like, have the strong act,

36
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.970
tell the weak act to get moving, but there's also times where, you know,

37
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:08.800
it's just, you know, a subtle voice entering my head about, you know,

38
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.120
I don't know if I feel quite right now, should I maybe pull back on the pace?

39
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.160
And I think that little subtle voice is best approached with a subtle positive

40
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.120
voice where it's more like, okay, well,

41
00:02:20.121 --> 00:02:21.520
let's think this through here for a second,

42
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.350
you're 40 miles into a hundred mile race, you spent four months for it. Uh,

43
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.870
you know, from the workouts you did that, you're ready for this.

44
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.950
There really isn't any real reason for you to slow down or to

45
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.830
fall off your goal or your pace, or, you know, reassess what you're doing.

46
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.750
Let's just give this another mile or two,

47
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.390
and then we can reassess if we need to.

48
00:02:44.391 --> 00:02:47.500
<v 2>And in order to kind of figure out if I'm doing the, of right things or not.</v>

49
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.740
And I think like in that situation, um,

50
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.220
you definitely probably wanna lean more towards the Sam Harris approach with

51
00:02:54.221 --> 00:02:55.740
that, because there's really no reason to,

52
00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.320
it's almost like the same thing you see with like just training and even

53
00:03:00.321 --> 00:03:03.880
nutrition to a degree where like some folks, they just wanna be like,

54
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.720
kind of like drilled.

55
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.360
<v 1>They want to be like yelled at and said, like, get going, get doing this.</v>

56
00:03:09.361 --> 00:03:11.760
And that helps. And that motivates them. That helps 'em stay accountable.

57
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.120
Other people need some softer love with it where it's like, you know,

58
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:18.400
this isn't necessarily your thought your, your fault,

59
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.150
you were put in this environment that kind of created an atmosphere of lethargy

60
00:03:23.151 --> 00:03:27.470
and maybe poor nutritional choices and things like that. And, and like, so,

61
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.070
but it's, it's correctable. So we need to, we need to step away from that.

62
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.110
And we need to kind of start heading in the direction that we know is gonna bear

63
00:03:34.111 --> 00:03:37.390
fruit down the road and that person may respond better to that.

64
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.620
So I think both those guys have great value with their approaches.

65
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:43.460
They're just probably polar into the, of the spectrum.

66
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.340
And I think most people are probably gonna benefit like anything, right?

67
00:03:47.341 --> 00:03:50.460
You get the polarizing ones and those are gonna work right for the polarizing

68
00:03:50.461 --> 00:03:52.660
people, but then most people are gonna fit somewhere in the middle.

69
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.100
So they're probably gonna be able to kind of pull from both of those,

70
00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:59.220
if they're able to sit down and kind of like assess which one's gonna work

71
00:03:59.221 --> 00:04:00.370
better or in which situation.
