00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.910
<v 0>So given this short life,</v>

2
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.510
we could think about jujitsu. We can think about any kind of pursuit.

3
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.750
What do you think makes a great life? Is it the highest

4
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.460
peak of achievement? You know, you think about like an Olympic metal,

5
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.700
the highest level of performance,

6
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.900
or is it the longevity of performance of doing many amazing

7
00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:32.580
things and doing it for a long time?

8
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.220
I think the latter is kind of what we talk about in at least American society.

9
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.380
You know, we want people to be healthy, balanced,

10
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.250
perform well for a long time.

11
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.170
And then there's maybe like the gladiator &lt;laugh&gt; ethic,

12
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.330
which is the highest peak is what defines.

13
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.930
<v 1>You asked an initial question, which what makes a great life,</v>

14
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.210
but then pointed towards two options.

15
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.680
One of longevity versus other degree of different there's,

16
00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:09.080
there's gotta be a lot more than that shortly. &lt;laugh&gt; um, uh, I mean,

17
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.280
think about, um, first of all, we have to understand from the start,

18
00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:17.600
there's never gonna be an agreed upon set of criteria for this is a great life

19
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.400
from all perspective. Uh, if you look from the perspective of say Maia valley,

20
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.710
then Stalin left a great life. Uh,

21
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.030
he was highly successful at what he did. He started from nothing.

22
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.590
So the degree of difficulty and what he did was extraordinarily high.

23
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.550
He had massive impact upon world history.

24
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.550
He oversaw the defeat of almost all of his major enemies.

25
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.190
He lived to old age and died of natural causes.

26
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.180
So for a much of Ali's point of view, he had a great life.

27
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.980
If you ask a Ukrainian farmer in the 1930s, whether he loved a great life,

28
00:01:51.981 --> 00:01:54.020
you get a very different answer. Um,

29
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.580
so everything's gonna come from what perspective you, you, you begin with this,

30
00:01:58.581 --> 00:02:01.260
you're going to look out at the world with a given point of view and you're

31
00:02:01.261 --> 00:02:04.500
gonna make your judgments. Was this a great life, or was this a terrible life?

32
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.970
Um, &lt;affirmative&gt; going back to your point. You were actually,

33
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.690
I think focusing the question on, on more in terms of, uh,

34
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.930
great single performances versus longevity of performances. Yes. Um,

35
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.130
presumably this isn't really a question about, uh, what makes a great life then,

36
00:02:24.131 --> 00:02:27.680
because there's so much more than that to a great life.

37
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.720
<v 0>I don't know I'm gonna push back on that.</v>

38
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.440
So I think their parallels are very much closer than you're making them seem.

39
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.880
I think it's, let's compare Stalin.

40
00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:40.640
Stalin is an example of somebody who held power considered by me to be one of

41
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.480
the most powerful men ever. He held power for 30 years.

42
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.560
So that's what I'm referring to longevity.

43
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.350
And then there's a few people I have to,

44
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.550
I wish my knowledge of history was better,

45
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.910
but people who fought a few great battles and they did

46
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.430
not maintain power, but there were.

47
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.280
<v 1>It's it's contrast say for example, Alexander, the great yes, who died at 33,</v>

48
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.760
um, from probably unnatural causes, um, uh,

49
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.960
had around four to five,

50
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.440
truly defining battles in his life, which, uh,

51
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.630
responsible for the, for the lion share of, of,

52
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.550
of his achievements and burned very bright, but didn't burn long.

53
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.990
Yes. Um, Stalin on the other hand started from nothing quietly.

54
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:32.550
Methodically worked his way through the revolutionary phase and, uh,

55
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.590
gained increasing amounts of power. And as he said.

56
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.540
<v 0>Um, went all the way to the end of a, uh, of his career. Um, yeah,</v>

57
00:03:42.541 --> 00:03:46.780
there's, there's definitely something to be said for, for longevity. Um,

58
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.700
but as to which one is greater than the other, you can't give a,

59
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.900
a, a definition or, um, a set of criteria, which will definitively say,

60
00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:01.530
this is it than that. But when you look, ultimately,

61
00:04:01.531 --> 00:04:03.730
we look at Alexandra as great, but in a different way.

62
00:04:03.731 --> 00:04:05.090
And we look at Stalin don't,

63
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.010
I didn't think many people would say Stalin was a great person,

64
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.090
but from the ma Allen point of view, uh, he would say he was,

65
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.370
uh, great also,

66
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.530
but when you think about beautiful creations done by human beings

67
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.760
in the space of say martial arts in the space of sport,

68
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.680
what inspires you? The peak.

69
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.440
<v 1>Of performance? I, I, I see where you're coming from Lexi it's,</v>

70
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:33.880
it's a great question. Um, for me, it always comes down to degree of difficulty,

71
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.760
but things are difficult in different ways. Okay. Um,

72
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.990
a single flawless performance in youth

73
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.350
is still a, that wins a gold medal. Let's say for example, um, uh,

74
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.230
NA Kasu won the Olympic gold medal in gymnastics,

75
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.990
the first person ever to get a perfect score. Um,

76
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.750
if she had disappeared after that, we would still remember that as a,

77
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.620
an incredible moment and the degree of difficult to,

78
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.780
to get a perfect score and Olympic gymnastics is just off their charts.

79
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.460
Um, and contrast that with someone who went to four Olympics and got four silver

80
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.500
medals, I mean, they're both incredible achievements. They just different, uh,

81
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.260
the, the attributes that lead to longevity, um, typically tend to,

82
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.810
with the attributes that bring a powerful single performance.

83
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.050
One is all about focus on a part on a particular event. The other is, uh, on,

84
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.170
uh, spreading your resources over time.

85
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.650
Both that present tremendous difficulties. Um, there's no,

86
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:39.970
to say one is better than the other.
