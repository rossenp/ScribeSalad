1
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.050
<v 0>So let's take a step back to a Roswell. We talked about a little bit.</v>

2
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.090
What's your sense about that whole time of Roswell and just area 51

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.380
and, um,

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.420
the sightings and also the follow on mythology around

5
00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:21.330
those sightings. Um, that's with us today.

6
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.330
<v 1>All right. So, well, I mean,</v>

7
00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:29.810
it is a mythology here, right? The mythology of Roswell it's,

8
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:30.920
it's very religious,

9
00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:34.490
like in the sense that if there's a pilgrimage to Roswell people make,

10
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.360
and they go to, there's a festival there as well,

11
00:00:38.361 --> 00:00:40.850
like a religious festival. Um,

12
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.120
you could get little kitschy stuff like you can get at a religious festival

13
00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:44.660
there.

14
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.560
So it's very much like a place of pilgrimage where a [inaudible] occurred.

15
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.360
And her off me is basically contact with non-human intelligence. Okay.

16
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.510
So non-human intelligence is thought to have contacted humans or crashed at

17
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.350
this place in Roswell, New Mexico.

18
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.450
Now what's fascinating is that I begin my book by going out to a crash site,

19
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.410
New Mexico. Um, I have to get blindfolded with, um,

20
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.390
my well, to tell you the truth. The story is that I'm with Tyler,

21
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.220
who's an invisible.

22
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.210
And he wants to show me a place in New Mexico where a crash happened.

23
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.010
And he says that he thinks that I need to see physical evidence because I don't

24
00:01:25.011 --> 00:01:29.150
believe. And so I said, I'll go, but I'm going to bring a friend of mine.

25
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.550
And he said, no, you have to go alone. He goes, it's a,

26
00:01:31.551 --> 00:01:35.480
it's a place that is on government owned property.

27
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.290
And it's a no fly zone. And when you go, you'll be blindfolded.

28
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.920
And I said, I definitely need to bring a friend.

29
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.510
So he said, well, who do you want to bring?

30
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.160
I just had met this university scientist. He's very well-known.

31
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.570
And I call him James in my book and I asked and I had a feeling James would

32
00:01:56.571 --> 00:02:00.380
definitely want to do this. And I asked James and he said, I'll go tomorrow.

33
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.340
Okay. So I suggested this to Tyler and Tyler say,

34
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.400
absolutely not. You know? And I thought, Hmm,

35
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.950
I know he's going to look up James. And he's going to say yes,

36
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.300
because if anybody can figure out what this material is that you're going to go

37
00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:19.220
look for, it's going to be James. He the instruments. And so Tyler did in fact,

38
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.430
look them up and finally said, okay, I got, you can go.

39
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.910
So we both head out there and we get blindfolded. Tyler takes us out there.

40
00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:29.720
It takes about 40 minutes, um, outside of a certain place in New Mexico.

41
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.130
So in terms of Roswell, this is what I can say is that according to Tyler,

42
00:02:34.131 --> 00:02:38.900
there were about seven crashes out in the 1940s in New Mexico

43
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.570
and in various places, um,

44
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.000
we went to one of them, according to Tyler, I,

45
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.840
at the time I was completely an atheist with regard to anything that had to do

46
00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:55.310
with UFO's. So we were out there, we had specially configured,

47
00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.910
um, metal detectors for these metals, and we did find these.

48
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.770
Okay. And, um, they've since been studied by very scientist, material,

49
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:08.410
scientists, so forth. And, um,

50
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.250
I believe jock talked about not those particular ones,

51
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:16.630
but others on the Joe Rogan show. Um,

52
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.890
there are no anomalies, so there are we, uh, scientists don't, I'm, uh,

53
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.330
I'm not a scientist, so I can't weigh in on whether I just,

54
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.550
I just believe the people, these people,

55
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:30.880
I believe because they're well-known scientists.

56
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.010
<v 2>What do you mean? They're not anomaly, so there's no, they.</v>

57
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.080
<v 1>Are not, they are non anomalous.</v>

58
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.970
<v 2>Oh.</v>

59
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.800
And almost in terms of the materials that are a naturally occurring on earth.

60
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.090
Yes. Okay. So that,

61
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.620
so there's some kinda inklings of evidence that, uh,

62
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.170
that something happened in Roswell in

63
00:03:55.171 --> 00:03:58.550
terms of crashes of alien technology. Uh,

64
00:03:58.551 --> 00:04:03.510
what else is there to the mythology? So there's some crashes,

65
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.460
right? I mean, that's kind of Epic, whatever. And,

66
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.680
uh, w w what else? Like what, um, what are we supposed to take away from this,

67
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.280
right.

68
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.230
<v 1>Yeah. So it's weird. Okay. So, um, there's this? Okay. So in religious studies,</v>

69
00:04:19.231 --> 00:04:20.850
like I said, we call it a, her off any,

70
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.380
which is the meeting of a non-human intelligent thing, whatever it is, an angel,

71
00:04:25.381 --> 00:04:30.330
a God, whatever a goddess with, or an alien with humans,

72
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.350
and that's the place. Okay. So the place is New Mexico. So we,

73
00:04:34.351 --> 00:04:39.150
so New Mexico becomes folded into the mythology of this

74
00:04:39.151 --> 00:04:43.560
new religion is what I call a new type of religion, um, of the UFO.

75
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.670
And it becomes ground zero for this new mythology,

76
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.190
just like Mecca is the, is the place where Muslims go. They have to go, right.

77
00:04:53.191 --> 00:04:55.920
At least once in their lives. It's a pilgrimage place now.

78
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.730
So this is so in my book, that's how I, I tell it now,

79
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.000
what about Roswell in the public imagination? Um,

80
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.320
obviously according to any Jacobson, who's good. You know,

81
00:05:07.321 --> 00:05:10.410
she's a great author. Um, investigative journalist,

82
00:05:10.411 --> 00:05:11.760
she's written about Roswell too.

83
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.430
I don't agree with all of what she comes up with,

84
00:05:14.431 --> 00:05:18.300
but part of it is that there's a lot of military stuff going on there that is

85
00:05:18.301 --> 00:05:22.290
classified, and there's a reason why you can't get in and nor would you want to.

86
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.600
Right. So, um, so there's a lot of experimentation going on there.

87
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.280
Um, I don't believe that it's has to do with ETS, frankly,

88
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.080
but in the imaginations of Americans, Roswell is that place.

89
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.640
But I went to a different place and apparently there are several places in New

90
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.690
Mexico. Now, strangely enough,

91
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.700
I traveled back to New Mexico at the very end chapter of my book,

92
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.910
but it's not it's, I don't, I don't go there physically.

93
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.860
I go there through the story of a Catholic nun

94
00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.830
who actually believes she by located to New Mexico, uh,

95
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.480
in the gosh in the 16 hundreds. So she,

96
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:06.920
yeah, it was very strange.

97
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:11.240
And I was at the Vatican at the space observatory when I made that connection

98
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:13.520
that she probably went to the very well,

99
00:06:13.521 --> 00:06:16.400
she believes she went to this very place that I had gone.

100
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.810
<v 2>Can you, uh, can you elaborate in a little bit, like,</v>

101
00:06:19.811 --> 00:06:24.700
what does it mean to go to that place? So, yeah, for, for her, I mean,

102
00:06:24.701 --> 00:06:26.890
it's just, we're kind of, um,

103
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.680
breaking down the barrier between what it means to be at a place

104
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.210
in time. Right.

105
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:39.130
<v 1>I agree with you. Uh, this is the field of religious studies. So, and again,</v>

106
00:06:39.131 --> 00:06:41.080
I don't say it's true in my book.

107
00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:45.670
I just say it's a very strange coincidence that I'm at the

108
00:06:45.671 --> 00:06:48.100
Vatican observatory. In fact, I'd finished my book,

109
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.950
but while I was at the Vatican observatory,

110
00:06:50.951 --> 00:06:54.670
I was there with Tyler and we were looking at the records,

111
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.620
the CA they're called the trial records,

112
00:06:56.621 --> 00:06:59.770
but they're the canonization records of these two saints.

113
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.350
Each was said to have done amazing things.

114
00:07:02.351 --> 00:07:05.890
One was Joseph of Cupertino who levitated, okay.

115
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.770
Is said to have levitated. The other was Maria of agritech from Spain,

116
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.940
their contemporaries in the 16 hundreds who were said to have been able to buy

117
00:07:15.941 --> 00:07:18.670
locate, which is to be in two places at once. Okay.

118
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.670
So this is a belief in Catholicism that certain,

119
00:07:21.671 --> 00:07:25.540
very Holy people can do these kinds of things like levitate, which by the way,

120
00:07:25.541 --> 00:07:28.780
is also associated with UFO abductions. You know,

121
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.330
people get levitated out of their beds and things like that.

122
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.490
So we were sent there, um,

123
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.990
by a billionaire who was interested in levitation and by

124
00:07:37.991 --> 00:07:42.160
location. And since I could get in to the Vatican,

125
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.910
and I knew the director of the Vatican observatory,

126
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.380
both Tyler and I were able to go to the secret archives and look at the

127
00:07:50.381 --> 00:07:54.640
canonization records and then go to castle Gandolfo,

128
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.120
which is about an hour from the Vatican where the first observatory,

129
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.770
the space observatory of the Vatican is the second one.

130
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:07.750
And it is in Arizona. And it has a much larger telescope. So we went and we,

131
00:08:07.751 --> 00:08:11.260
and brother, guy gave me the keys to the archive. I said,

132
00:08:11.261 --> 00:08:14.260
look at anything you want. And I got to see a lot of stuff by Carl Sagan,

133
00:08:14.261 --> 00:08:16.630
by the way, I know you talked about, yeah, it was awesome.

134
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.240
So they have a whole section on extra terrestrial,

135
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:23.080
the search for extra terrestrial life and they don't by the way. Awesome.

136
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:24.940
<v 2>It was awesome. Yeah. So we.</v>

137
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.810
<v 1>Got to stay there. They have a scholars quarters, and so they had to,</v>

138
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:33.430
and so Tyler stayed and Wayne and I stayed in the other and brother guy

139
00:08:33.431 --> 00:08:37.150
probably shouldn't have been so nice to me and given me the, um, the keys,

140
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.800
because I, when I got home, we were there for two weeks. When I got home,

141
00:08:41.801 --> 00:08:45.610
I got this frantic phone call from him and he basically said, Diana, he goes,

142
00:08:45.611 --> 00:08:48.430
do you remember where you put the, the original Kepler?

143
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.840
And so I had this Kepler, right. And so I misplaced it.

144
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.580
<v 2>Luckily.</v>

145
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.940
<v 1>I remembered where it went. I was like, Oh gosh, thank goodness I found it,</v>

146
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:04.740
but he'll probably change the rules of the Vatican observatory after my visit.

147
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:06.420
So Maria is, um,

148
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:11.250
she's actually in the history of our country in that she

149
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.090
first wrote a Cosmati graphy of, um,

150
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.130
what she said was the spinning earth.

151
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.790
And this was in the 16 hundreds and she that's her first book.

152
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:21.990
And she wrote that.

153
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:27.360
And then she said that she was transported on the wings

154
00:09:27.361 --> 00:09:29.550
of angels to the new world.

155
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:34.320
And she said that she met a culture of people and

156
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:39.030
she basically told them about the faith of Catholicism. Okay.

157
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:44.340
And then what happened was that the people that sh and she described the fauna,

158
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.190
she described the people and everything like that.

159
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.590
And so there were actually missionaries there.

160
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.090
And when they went to try to, um,

161
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.990
convert some of the people who already lived there, um,

162
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.390
apparently they already knew a bunch of stuff. And they said,

163
00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:02.640
how did you know all this stuff? And they said, uh,

164
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:06.780
this lady in blue came and told us, and they said, did it look like this?

165
00:10:06.781 --> 00:10:09.660
And they showed them, they didn't obviously didn't have a photograph,

166
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.760
but they had a picture of a, a sister, a nun. And they say,

167
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:19.920
yeah, they, she works similar clothes, but she was much younger. Right.

168
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:22.410
And these guys were, you know, thought that was weird.

169
00:10:22.411 --> 00:10:23.730
But when they went back to Spain,

170
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:28.770
they found that this woman had been doing that in her mind had been traveling.

171
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.860
<v 0>I mean, I don't know what to make of it.</v>

172
00:10:30.861 --> 00:10:35.750
There's so many things that are sort of forcing you to kind of go outside of,

173
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:38.690
um, you know, I'm of many minds. I've very,

174
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:43.370
most of my days spent with very rigorous scientific kind of things

175
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.030
and even engineering kind of things. And then I'm also open-minded.

176
00:10:47.031 --> 00:10:49.420
And just the,

177
00:10:49.421 --> 00:10:53.870
the entirety of the idea of extraterrestrial life forces you to think outside

178
00:10:53.871 --> 00:10:55.640
of, uh,

179
00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:00.410
conventional boundaries of thought scientific, current scientific thought,

180
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:05.960
let's put it that way and your story now. So the example of that, yeah.

181
00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:07.730
That's a nice way to put it.
