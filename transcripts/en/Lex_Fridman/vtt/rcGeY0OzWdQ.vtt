1
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.430
<v 0>What do you make, uh, of Elon Musk investing with Tesla,</v>

2
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.910
investing in Bitcoin and maybe broad broaden that out in some of

3
00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:16.910
these other, you know, big billionaires,

4
00:00:16.911 --> 00:00:19.430
but also people tied to major companies investing in Bitcoin.

5
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.340
<v 1>Yeah, I think Michael sail really led the charge on that. Uh,</v>

6
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.420
so he's the CEO of MicroStrategy that I think they've acquired upwards of 2

7
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.140
billion in Bitcoin now sort acquiring August maybe of 2020.

8
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.380
And he's, you know, personally bought a lot of it.

9
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.290
He bought a lot as a treasurer reserve asset for his company micro

10
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.730
strategy. Then they leveraged up, uh, on a convertible note and bought more.

11
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.330
So he's really gone really leading the charge in this

12
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.730
Bitcoin institutional adoption. Yeah.

13
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.210
<v 0>Your conversation with him is a really interesting one, your series of, I mean,</v>

14
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.850
series of episodes, I suppose, but it's only a couple of conversations.

15
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.840
<v 1>I guess. Yeah. We, we, we recorded twice, five and a half hours each. Yes.</v>

16
00:01:08.841 --> 00:01:11.440
So it's about 11 hours of content and yeah, thank you.

17
00:01:11.441 --> 00:01:14.720
It's a lot of people have said that, uh,

18
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.920
it's the best first principle thing they've ever seen on Bitcoin,

19
00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:20.080
which I take no credit for that at all. I mean,

20
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.950
I just sat down with a guy and unleashed him. He's he's just a beast. Yeah.

21
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.230
<v 0>Uh, but it's fascinating that, uh,</v>

22
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.190
his long term vision with it, I mean,

23
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.910
I'm not sure I'm all &lt;laugh&gt; philosophically bought in,

24
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.710
but if he's right,

25
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.750
if this set of ideas are as powerful as, um, he describes,

26
00:01:43.751 --> 00:01:46.180
as you described that this, this would change the world,

27
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.740
which as you say is funny that a company like MicroStrategy, uh,

28
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.260
might be &lt;laugh&gt; the, the, the, the company that has the,

29
00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.060
the biggest macro effect, uh, on our economy and our world. Yeah.

30
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.500
<v 1>The conversation reshaped my world view a lot too,</v>

31
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.810
because he framed money as energy,

32
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.770
which I had often thought of money as time. Um,

33
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.970
and it explored those connections a lot in my writing,

34
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.090
but looking at it as energy and then his supposition that

35
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.490
the purpose of life is to basically channel energy across space and time.

36
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.880
So we're just trying to figure out how to channel more energy you across space

37
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.080
and time toward the satisfaction of aims and, uh,

38
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.120
his definition, his answer to that question,

39
00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:36.640
what is money is that money is the highest form of energy a human being can

40
00:02:36.641 --> 00:02:37.474
channel.

41
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.120
So it's a claim to all other forms of energy we can manifest in the world.

42
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.080
And that just completely reshaped how I see it brought in this whole,

43
00:02:46.081 --> 00:02:50.670
other to my, my intellectual explorations of money.

44
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.163
Can you elaborate.

45
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.790
<v 0>On that a little bit? So I understand money is time,</v>

46
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.910
which in itself a really powerful idea.

47
00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.360
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but money is energy and channeling.

48
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.600
<v 1>Energy. Can, can you break that apart? Yeah.</v>

49
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.840
So I guess I definitely have to check out the whole series to really get his

50
00:03:06.841 --> 00:03:10.200
perspective, but I'll do my best to condense it. Um,

51
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.760
life itself, all forms of life are, you know, they're dependent on energy,

52
00:03:16.761 --> 00:03:21.590
right? Energy fuels, everything fuels life in action and motion and all of that.

53
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.110
And we could say that, uh, maybe like a plant

54
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.750
is harnessing solar energy and then reallocating that into

55
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.750
growth. So it's aim is to grow towards the sun, right?

56
00:03:35.751 --> 00:03:40.300
So it's allocating energy towards its goal of the harnessing more solar

57
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.340
energy kind of thing. So, and humans too,

58
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.340
uh, have evolved to figure out how to harness energy in different ways

59
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.620
to satisfy higher and more complicated aims.

60
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.460
So the original energy network, uh, that he may,

61
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.690
that he referenced was fire, right.

62
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.090
We actually learned to WID fire as a tool in and of itself.

63
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.650
So not only are we learning to channel energy,

64
00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:13.210
but we actually learned how to isolate energy as a tool in and of itself.

65
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.890
And so we went into that, how harnessing fire had,

66
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:21.360
had changed human being actually, um,

67
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.680
this is one of the earliest examples too,

68
00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:29.640
of a co-evolution between tool and our biology, because when we developed fire,

69
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.560
we developed cooking and cooking is you can kind of think of it as pre-digestion

70
00:04:34.561 --> 00:04:38.800
in a way where liberating these macronutrients or making things that otherwise

71
00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:42.230
would not be digestible edible. Um,

72
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.430
and it increases the efficiency by which we extract nutrients from food.

73
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.830
That's what cooking does. So when we figured out cooking, we free,

74
00:04:50.831 --> 00:04:53.910
we liberated all these digestive resources, um,

75
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.670
that were reallocated towards higher cognitive development. So there's this,

76
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.540
uh, evolutionary path between figuring out fat and us becoming smarter, which,

77
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.860
which was interesting. Um, some other early examples he gave,

78
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.140
he went into were missiles and hydraulics. So missiles being,

79
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.420
we learned to hunt at a distance. You know, we can't bring down a wooly mammoth,

80
00:05:19.421 --> 00:05:22.530
maybe with Spears and, and, uh,

81
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.730
up close in personal force,

82
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.050
but we could with Spears and javelins and slings and whatnot.

83
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.090
And then he went into, uh,

84
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.730
how we've used water to channel hydraulic energy.

85
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.770
So we can basically overcome gravity. We could move, you know, um,

86
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.160
there's theories that the pyramids were constructed using the blocks were moved

87
00:05:43.161 --> 00:05:46.120
using hydraulic energy or using water. Uh,

88
00:05:46.121 --> 00:05:50.120
clearly we use like cargo ships and whatnot to move things much more efficiently

89
00:05:50.121 --> 00:05:53.400
across water than we could the land. So this,

90
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.400
his whole view was how we keep figuring out better ways or more

91
00:05:58.401 --> 00:06:01.600
efficient ways to harness energy and, and channel it. And in that

92
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.303
perspective,

93
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.480
money has always represented a claim on all other forms of energy.

94
00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.440
So whatever energy couldn't be channeled towards something useful,

95
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.240
and the economy historically would go into gold mining.

96
00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.950
So gold became this residual, this economic,

97
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:25.070
this token of the excess energy created by the market

98
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:28.470
economy. And then you could take that token of energy and use it,

99
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.550
use it to redeem for any other form of energy or any other products of energy

100
00:06:32.551 --> 00:06:36.950
itself. So I it's, I guess,

101
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.620
guess it's my best approximation of it.

102
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.780
And it just really shattered my worldview again,

103
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.220
cause I'd always thought about it as time.

104
00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.180
Like we spend time sacrificing to obtain money that within redeem for

105
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.380
commencement sacrifices from other others,

106
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.900
but I'd never considered it purely as energy.

107
00:06:52.901 --> 00:06:56.140
And then it also ties back into gold where

108
00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.370
there was an energy expenditure necessary to obtain gold.

109
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:05.090
So there's a proof of work associated with obtaining gold that protected its

110
00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:08.690
market value. Right? So you had to expend again, if market,

111
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.690
if market value of Gold's 2000 an ounce,

112
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.770
you had to expend 1900 an ounces mining. So it kept, uh,

113
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:16.370
producers honest in a way.
