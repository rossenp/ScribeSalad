1
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:07.390
<v 0>So one thing that I was clearly bothered by,</v>

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.630
and maybe you could be my therapist as well. &lt;laugh&gt; I.

3
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.663
<v 1>Bet you were mine.</v>

4
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:12.670
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; this is,</v>

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.230
this is a little bit of a miscommunication on both of our parts then. Um,

6
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.390
because who's paying who for this &lt;laugh&gt;

7
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.220
I was really bothered it by, uh,

8
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.020
Amazon banning parlor from AWS,

9
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.980
because my assumption was that the infrastructure I

10
00:00:32.981 --> 00:00:34.780
drew a distinction between AWS,

11
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.380
the infrastructure on which competing platforms could be created

12
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.090
is different than the actual platforms. So I, I,

13
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.930
the standard of the ideal of freedom of speech, I, in my mind,

14
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.690
in the shallow way, perhaps applied differently to AWS than I did to Twitter,

15
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.810
it felt that we've created a more dangerous world.

16
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.160
That freedoms were violated by banning, uh,

17
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.560
parlor from AWS, which I saw as the computing infrastructure,

18
00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:12.080
which enables the competition of tools,

19
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.320
the competition of frameworks of communication.

20
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.800
What do you think about this? First of all, let me give.

21
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.040
<v 1>You the, the, uh, internet hyena answer. I understand dude,</v>

22
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.590
just build your own Amazon on. Yeah.

23
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.710
<v 0>Right? Yes. Well, so that's a very shallow statement,</v>

24
00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:31.990
but it's also one that has some legitimacy.

25
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.670
We can't completely dismiss it because, uh, there's levels to this,

26
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.903
to this game.

27
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.990
<v 1>Yes and no, but if we, if you really wanted to chase that down. Yeah.</v>

28
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.750
One of the great things about a person to person conversation,

29
00:01:43.751 --> 00:01:46.660
as opposed to like, let's have 30 of our closest friends.

30
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.300
Whenever we have a conversation with 30 of our closest friends,

31
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.220
you know what happens? It's like passing light through a prism.

32
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.340
Every person says something interesting. And as a result, it's always muddled.

33
00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.620
You like nothing ever resolves.

34
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.660
<v 0>Well, one of my conversational techniques you mentioned, uh, you push back is,</v>

35
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.010
uh, uh, first this childlike naive day and curiosity,

36
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.170
but also real or simulated real I'm afraid I would.

37
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.250
<v 1>80% Real. Yeah. Right. So in this paradigm, yeah.</v>

38
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.690
How could you not see this coming? I mean, I did a show with, um,

39
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.880
Ashley Matthews. Who's the woman behind Riley Reed and specific about this.

40
00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:31.120
It was about the idea that if I move away from politics and go towards sex,

41
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.920
uh, I know that there's always a move to use the infrastructure to shut down,

42
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.880
um, sex workers. And in this case, uh,

43
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:45.880
we had operation choke point under the Obama, uh, administration.

44
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.790
We have a positive passion for people who want to solve

45
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.350
problems, that they, they don't like this company. They don't like that company.

46
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.870
Payday loans would be another one.

47
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.120
And so you have legal companies that are harassed by our financial system,

48
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:05.600
that her you can't, you know, uh, as Riley Reed, uh,

49
00:03:05.601 --> 00:03:08.960
Ashley couldn't get a MailChimp account according to her,

50
00:03:08.961 --> 00:03:10.320
if I understand her correctly.

51
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.960
And this idea that you charge these people higher rates because of supposed,

52
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.750
uh, chargebacks on credit cards, even if their chargebacks are low. Yes.

53
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.630
We have an unofficial policy of harassment.

54
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.470
There's something about everybody who shows up at Davos. Uh,

55
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.950
they get drunk in the Swiss Alps and then they come back home and they

56
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:36.230
coordinate and they coordinate things like build back better.

57
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.550
We don't really understand what build back better is.

58
00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:42.860
But my get is is that build back better, has to do with extremism in America.

59
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.220
How do we shut down the Republican party as the source of extremism?

60
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.180
Now I do think the Republican party was got very extreme under Trump.

61
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.780
And I do believe that that was responsive to how extreme the democratic party,

62
00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.730
uh, got under Clinton and then Obama,

63
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.570
and then Hillary, and in all of these circumstances,

64
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.530
it's amazing how much we want to wield these things as weapons. Well,

65
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.890
our extremism is fine because we pretend that at TIFA doesn't exist and we don't

66
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:18.770
report what goes on in, in Portland, but your extremism, my God,

67
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.720
that's disgust &lt;affirmative&gt; this is the completely ridiculous place that we're

68
00:04:23.721 --> 00:04:24.554
in. And by the way,

69
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.640
our friends in part are Cod up on tech money and

70
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.560
they don't appear to hold the courage of their convictions at a political

71
00:04:35.561 --> 00:04:39.520
level, because it's not in keeping with shareholder value. You know,

72
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:42.950
at some level air holder value is the ultimate shield with,

73
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.430
with which everyone can cloak themselves.

74
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.510
<v 0>Well, on that point,</v>

75
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.070
Donald Trump was banned from Twitter and I'm not sure it was a good

76
00:04:54.071 --> 00:04:58.310
financial decision for Twitter, right. Uh, but I'm,

77
00:04:58.311 --> 00:04:59.790
perhaps you can correct me if I'm.

78
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:00.471
<v 1>Wrong. Um, well,</v>

79
00:05:00.471 --> 00:05:03.940
are you thinking locally or are you thinking if Twitter refused to, well,

80
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.020
if Twitter refused to ban Donald Trump, what is the odds that, that, uh,

81
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.340
the full force of the antitrust division might find.

82
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.140
<v 0>Them? I don't know. Oh, I see. I see. So there's a, a complicated thing. Well.</v>

83
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.900
<v 1>There's a look, these guys are all having a discussion in very practical terms.</v>

84
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.210
You know, you can say, you can imagine the sorts of conversation,

85
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.490
Jack Marks under. We're really glad you're all here. We're,

86
00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:29.370
we're all trying to sing from the same him and row in the same direction.

87
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.650
We understand free speech. We're completely committed to it,

88
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.210
but we have to draw along with extremism guys. We, we just need,

89
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.050
we need to make sure that we're all on the same page. Well, they.

90
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.160
<v 0>Use the term violence too, and they, I think overly it.</v>

91
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.240
So basically anybody who &lt;laugh&gt;, &lt;laugh&gt;,

92
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.240
I'm, I'm telling you I'm, uh, I say dumb things to, uh, to incentivize,

93
00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.240
uh, thoughtful.

94
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.920
<v 1>Conversations. Okay. Well, whatever these things are, there is no trace.</v>

95
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.880
Like how old are you Lex? You're in your mid thirties. Yeah. To late forties,

96
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.280
mid, late twenties to late forties. Yeah.

97
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:09.200
Somewhere in there that that's the demographic is.

98
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.000
I do think that partially what's happened is,

99
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.760
is that your group has never seen functional institutions.

100
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.750
These institutions have been so compromised for so long. Uh,

101
00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.550
you've probably never seen an adult.
