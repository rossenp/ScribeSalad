00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.510
<v 0>Let me say a few words about COVID 19 and about science broadly.</v>

2
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.670
I think science is beautiful and powerful.

3
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.990
It is the striving of the human mind to understand and to solve the problems of

4
00:00:14.991 --> 00:00:17.230
the world. But as an institution,

5
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.670
it is susceptible to the flaws of human nature,

6
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.660
to fear greed power and, and ego.

7
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.540
2020 is a story of all of these that has both scientific triumph and tragedy.

8
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.780
<v 1>We needed great leaders and we didn't get them.</v>

9
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.780
What we needed is leaders who communicate in an honest, transparent,

10
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.860
and authentic way about the uncertainty of what we know and a large scale

11
00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:44.810
scientific efforts to reduce that uncertainty and to develop solutions.

12
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.970
I believe there are several candidates for solutions that could have all saved

13
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.210
hundreds of billions of dollars and lessened or eliminated the

14
00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:55.370
suffering of millions of people.

15
00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.410
Let me mention five of the categories of solutions masks at home testing,

16
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.850
anonymized, contact tracing, antiviral, drugs,

17
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.320
and vaccines within each of these categories,

18
00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:11.920
institutional leaders should have constantly asked and answered publicly.

19
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.320
<v 0>Honestly, the following three questions. One,</v>

20
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.760
what data do we have on the solution?

21
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.680
And what studies are we running to get more and better data?

22
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.480
Two given the current data and uncertainty,

23
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.630
how effect and how safe is the solution? Three,

24
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.590
what is the timeline and cost involved with mass manufacturing,

25
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.870
distribution of the solution in the service of these questions?

26
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.790
No voices should have been silenced. No ideas left off the table, open data,

27
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.790
open science, open, honest, scientific communication,

28
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.030
and debate was the way not sign.

29
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.420
There are a lot of ideas out there that are bad, wrong, dangerous,

30
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.340
but the moment we have the hubris to say, we know which ideas those are,

31
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.220
is the moment we'll lose our ability to define the truth,

32
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.300
to find solutions that vary things that make science beautiful and powerful

33
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.370
in the face of all the dangers that threat and the wellbeing and the existence

34
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:08.770
of humans on earth.

35
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.610
This conversation with Brett is less about the ideas we talk about.

36
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.650
We agree some disagree on others.

37
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.890
It is much more about the very freedom to talk, to think,

38
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.410
to share ideas.

39
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.650
This freedom is our only hope Brett should never have been censored.

40
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.120
I asked Brad to do this podcast to show solidarity and to show that I have hope

41
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.200
for science and for humanity.
