00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.460
<v 0>So to me, a developer machine learning researcher,</v>

2
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.930
how do I let Freeman participate in this competition? And how do others,

3
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.990
I'm sure there'll be a lot of others interested in participating in this

4
00:00:14.991 --> 00:00:18.650
competition. What are, uh, let's see, there's like a million questions,

5
00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:21.770
but like first one is how do I get started?

6
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.410
<v 1>Well, you can go to numer.ai, sign up, download the data.</v>

7
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.780
And on the data is pretty small. Um,

8
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.020
in the data pack you download, there's like an example,

9
00:00:36.021 --> 00:00:40.940
script Python scripts that just builds a XG boost model very

10
00:00:40.941 --> 00:00:44.540
quickly from the data. Uh, and, um,

11
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.920
so in a very short time, you can have an example model.

12
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.350
Is it a particular structure? Like what, uh.

13
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.540
<v 0>Is this model then submitted somewhere?</v>

14
00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:56.480
So there's needs to be some kind of structure that communicates with some kind

15
00:00:56.481 --> 00:01:00.830
of API. Like how does the whole odd is that your model?

16
00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:04.100
Once you built the wants to create a little, little baby Frankenstein,

17
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.160
how does it then live in?

18
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.880
<v 1>Yeah. Well,</v>

19
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.470
we want you to keep your baby Frankenstein at home and take care of it.

20
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.570
We don't want it. Okay. So we, you never upload your model to us. You always,

21
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.970
um, only giving us predictions. So we never see the code that wrote your model,

22
00:01:19.971 --> 00:01:23.360
which is pretty cool. Yeah. Our whole hedge fund is built from models.

23
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.970
We've never ever seen the code. Um,

24
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.780
but it's important for the users because it's their IP.

25
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.860
They want to give it to us as brilliant. So they've got it themselves,

26
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.750
but they can basically almost like license the predictions from that.

27
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.440
Um, so think about it. What some users do is they set up a, uh,

28
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.990
compute server. We call it numeric compute.

29
00:01:47.991 --> 00:01:52.370
It's like a little AWS kind of image and you can automate this process.

30
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.700
Um, so we can ping you. We can be like, we need more predictions now,

31
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.380
and then you, you send it to us.

32
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.930
<v 0>Okay, cool. So th that's, uh, is that described somewhere,</v>

33
00:02:02.931 --> 00:02:07.370
like what the preferred is the AWS or whether another cloud platform

34
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.660
is there, I mean,

35
00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:12.470
is there sort of specific technical things you want to say that comes to mind

36
00:02:12.471 --> 00:02:16.670
that, uh, is a good path for getting started? So download the data,

37
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.420
maybe play around, see if, uh,

38
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.910
you can modify the basic, uh,

39
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.550
the algorithm provided in the

40
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.300
example, and then you,

41
00:02:29.301 --> 00:02:34.160
what set up a little server on AWS that then runs this model and takes

42
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.500
pings and then makes predictions. And, uh,

43
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.290
how does your own money actually come into play, doing the stake of,

44
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:43.850
um, uh, cryptocurrency?

45
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.550
<v 1>Yeah. So you don't have to stake.</v>

46
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.890
You can start without staking and many users might try for months, uh,

47
00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:52.790
without staking,

48
00:02:52.791 --> 00:02:57.080
anything at all to see if their model works on the real life data. Right.

49
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.590
And is not overfit. Um, but then, uh, you can get numeraire,

50
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.750
uh, many different ways you can buy it on. Um, you can buy some on Coinbase.

51
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.830
You can buy some on unit swap, you can buy some on Binance. Um.

52
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.970
<v 0>So w what did you say? This is, uh, how do you pronounce it?</v>

53
00:03:14.971 --> 00:03:19.830
So this is the new MRI, uh, cryptocurrency NMR, NMR.

54
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.080
You just say NMR.

55
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.820
<v 1>It is technically called numeraire numeraire. Yeah,</v>

56
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.350
but NMR is simple.

57
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.230
<v 0>[Inaudible] okay. So, and you could buy it, uh, you know, basically anywhere.</v>

58
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.680
<v 1>Yeah. So it's a bit strange. Cause sometimes people be like, is this like,</v>

59
00:03:37.681 --> 00:03:42.060
pay to play? Right. And it's like, sore. It's like, yeah,

60
00:03:42.061 --> 00:03:45.210
you need to put some money down to show us, you believe in your model,

61
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.210
but weirdly we're, we're not selling you the car. Like,

62
00:03:48.211 --> 00:03:52.410
you can't buy the cryptocurrency from us. Right. It's like,

63
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.240
it's also, we never, if you're, if you do badly, um,

64
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.410
we destroy your cryptocurrency. Okay. That's not good. Right.

65
00:04:01.411 --> 00:04:02.580
You don't want it to be destroyed,

66
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.690
but what's good about it is it's also not coming to us. Right.

67
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.330
So it's not like we win when you lose or, or something like that. Like,

68
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.530
we're the house, like, we're definitely on the same team. Yes.

69
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.290
You're helping us make a hedge fund. That's never been done.

70
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.710
<v 0>Yeah. So again, interests are aligned. There's no, uh,</v>

71
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.210
there's no tension there at all,

72
00:04:21.211 --> 00:04:23.880
which is really fascinating given away everything.

73
00:04:23.881 --> 00:04:28.290
And then the IP is owned by the sort of the, the code. You never share the code.

74
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.940
That's fascinating. Um,

75
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.810
so since I have you here and you said a hundred,

76
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.730
I didn't ask I out of how many, so we'll just, but if, uh,

77
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.570
if I, then once he gets started and you find this interesting,

78
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.340
uh, how do you then win or do well,

79
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.160
but also how do you potentially try to, when,

80
00:04:50.161 --> 00:04:53.520
if this is something you want to take on seriously from the machine learning

81
00:04:53.521 --> 00:04:55.680
perspective, not from a financial perspective.

82
00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.120
<v 1>Yeah. I think, um, the first of all, you want to talk to the community.</v>

83
00:05:00.121 --> 00:05:01.740
People are pretty open. Uh,

84
00:05:01.741 --> 00:05:05.910
we give out really interesting scripts and ideas for things you might want to

85
00:05:05.911 --> 00:05:09.030
try. Um, and, uh,

86
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.120
but you also going to need a lot of compute probably.

87
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.820
And so some of the best users are, are, you know,

88
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.240
actually the very first time someone, one on numerous,

89
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.700
I would re I wrote them a personal email. It's like, you know,

90
00:05:20.701 --> 00:05:24.990
you've won some money. We're so excited to give you $300. And then they said,

91
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.340
I spend way more on the computer. Um, but.

92
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.940
<v 0>It's fundamentally a machine learning problem. First, I think is,</v>

93
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.770
this is one of the exciting things I don't know,

94
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.260
full in how many ways you can approach this,

95
00:05:37.261 --> 00:05:41.280
but really this is less about kind of

96
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.950
no offense, but like finance people, finance minded people. They're also,

97
00:05:46.951 --> 00:05:47.880
I'm sure great people,

98
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.050
but it feels like from the community that I've experienced,

99
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.060
these are people who see finances, a fascinating, uh,

100
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.140
problem, space, a source of data,

101
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.950
but ultimately they're machine learning people or AI people,

102
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.500
which is a very different kind of flavor of community. And, um, I mean, I,

103
00:06:07.501 --> 00:06:09.260
I should say to that, uh,

104
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.190
I I'd love to participate in this and I will participate in this.

105
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.580
And I'd love to hear from other people, if you're listening to this,

106
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:20.210
if you're a machine learning person, you should participate in it. And tell me,

107
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.960
uh, give me some hints, um, how I can, uh, do well at this thing.

108
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.180
Cause this boomer, uh, I'm not sure I still got it, but cause some of it is,

109
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.220
uh, it's like a Kaggle competitions.

110
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:36.110
Like some of it is certainly set ideas,

111
00:06:36.111 --> 00:06:39.980
like research ideas and like fundamental innovation,

112
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.090
but I'm sure some of it is like deeply understanding getting like an intuition

113
00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:44.924
about the data.

114
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.240
And then like a lot of it will be like figuring out like what works like tricks.

115
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.880
I mean, you could, you could argue most of the deep learning research,

116
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.420
it's just tricks on top of tricks, but there's, uh,

117
00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.130
there's some of it is just the art of getting to know how to work in a really

118
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:02.630
difficult machine learning problem.

119
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.690
<v 1>And I think what's important,</v>

120
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.620
the important difference with something like a Kaggle competition where they'll

121
00:07:08.621 --> 00:07:13.510
set up this kind of toy problem, and then they will be an out of sample test,

122
00:07:13.511 --> 00:07:17.560
like, Hey, you did well out of sample. And this is like, okay, cool. Um,

123
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.800
but what's cool with memorize your, your,

124
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.730
the out of sample is the real livestock market. We,

125
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.510
we don't even know, like we don't know the answer to the problem with it.

126
00:07:28.511 --> 00:07:33.070
We don't like you'll have to find out live. And so we've had users who've,

127
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.420
who've like submitted every week for, for like four years. Um,

128
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.880
because it's kind of a intro. It,

129
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.470
we say it's the hardest data science problem on the planet. Right.

130
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.371
And it's that sense?

131
00:07:45.371 --> 00:07:48.460
Maybe it sounds like maybe a bit too much for like a marketing thing,

132
00:07:48.461 --> 00:07:52.120
but it's the hardest, because it's the stock market. It's like,

133
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:56.380
literally there are like billions of dollars at stake and like, no,

134
00:07:56.381 --> 00:07:59.050
one's like letting it be inefficient on purpose.

135
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:01.630
So if you can find something that works a Numerai,

136
00:08:01.631 --> 00:08:05.680
you really have something that, that is like working on the real stock market.

137
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:10.480
<v 0>Yeah. Because there's like humans involved in the stock market mean this, uh,</v>

138
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.970
you know, you could argue them might be harder data sets ag,

139
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.020
maybe predicting the weather, all those kinds of things. But the,

140
00:08:16.021 --> 00:08:19.540
the fundamental statement here is which I, like, I was thinking like,

141
00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:24.040
is this really the hardest data size problem? And you start thinking about that,

142
00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:28.480
but ultimately it also boils down to a problem where the data is

143
00:08:28.481 --> 00:08:30.520
accessible. It's made accessible,

144
00:08:30.521 --> 00:08:34.930
made really easy and efficient at like

145
00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:38.410
submitting algorithms. So it's not just, you know,

146
00:08:38.411 --> 00:08:40.060
it's not about the data being out there,

147
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.120
like the weather it's about making the data super accessible,

148
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.640
making the ability to community around it.

149
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.080
Like this is what imaging that did exactly. Like it's not just,

150
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.130
there's always images. The point is you aggregate them together.

151
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.150
You give it a little, this is a community. And that's,

152
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:01.770
that was one of the hardest right. For a time, uh,

153
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:06.780
and most important data science problems in the world, uh,

154
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.900
because it was accessible because it was, uh, made, uh,

155
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:15.180
sort of like there was a mechanisms by which like standards

156
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:16.890
and mechanisms by which to judge your performance,

157
00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:19.680
all those kinds of things and memorize the excess step up from that.

158
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.520
Is there something more you can say about why, from your perspective,

159
00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:27.630
it's the hardest, uh, problem in the world? I mean,

160
00:09:27.631 --> 00:09:29.250
you said it's connected to the market.

161
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.650
So if you can find a pattern in the market,

162
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.760
that's a really difficult thing to do because a lot of people are trying to do

163
00:09:35.761 --> 00:09:36.594
it.

164
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.210
<v 1>Exactly. But there's also the,</v>

165
00:09:38.211 --> 00:09:42.830
the biggest one is it's it's non-stationary time series.

166
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:48.140
We've tried to regularize the data. So you can find patents, uh,

167
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:51.170
by, by doing certain things to the features and the targets,

168
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.650
but ultimately you're in a space where you don't,

169
00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:59.450
there's no guarantees that the out of sample distributions will, uh,

170
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:03.080
conform to any of the training data and,

171
00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:07.670
and every single, um, era which we call on the website,

172
00:10:07.671 --> 00:10:10.430
like every single era in the data, which is like,

173
00:10:10.431 --> 00:10:13.550
sort of showing you the order of the time. Um,

174
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:19.070
it's it's even the draining data is, has the same, same dislocations.

175
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:23.750
And, um, so yeah. It's and then, so, and then there's,

176
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.960
yeah. There's so many things that might, um, might, you might want to try this,

177
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:34.070
this, like, there's unlimited possible number of models. Right. Um, and so

178
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.340
by, by having it be open, uh,

179
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:42.620
we can at least search that space.
