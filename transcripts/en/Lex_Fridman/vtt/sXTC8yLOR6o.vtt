00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.340
<v 0>You've also joined that stream,</v>

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.380
got to interact one of the greatest athletes of all time, birth pressure.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.780
What's your he's actually doing,

4
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.140
I don't know if you're paying attention to this,

5
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.100
but I guess he has a goal of running 2000 miles this year. Yeah. I don't,

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.340
I've uh, gotten a chance to talk to Joe Rogan, uh, yesterday about this,

7
00:00:19.341 --> 00:00:21.460
which is, uh, fascinating. He,

8
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.450
I think he's a little bit doubtful of Albert's ability to be the ultra

9
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.610
performer that, uh, he so naturally is. Yeah. Um,

10
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.650
what's your thoughts about Burt as a runner? What's your advice to him?

11
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.730
And what was your interaction like as part of this treadmill challenge with him?

12
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.490
I.

13
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.170
<v 1>Love Burt because he's such a nice person. I mean,</v>

14
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.720
as a guy who's just accelerated in popularity over the last few years,

15
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.840
like he is like super kind. So for folks who are curious,

16
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.880
like I I've met Burt a couple years earlier and I just randomly asked him like,

17
00:00:55.881 --> 00:00:57.280
Hey, I'm doing this livestream thing.

18
00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.040
We're doing it for fight for the forgotten.

19
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:00.200
We're trying to raise some funds for them.

20
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.240
Would you wanna come on the livestream for a bit?

21
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.350
And I thought be he'd come off for like five or 10 minutes. And I thought,

22
00:01:06.351 --> 00:01:08.950
that'd be amazing if he did that. He ended up coming on for like over an hour.

23
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.510
He said he went past his slot,

24
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.470
sat in the next slot and just started talking with some of the other guests.

25
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.190
&lt;laugh&gt;, it's just, he's just a Burt is definitely like,

26
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.470
I feel like he's as unchanged from like his popularity as one can get away with

27
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.140
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and it's just like his,

28
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.100
his lifestyle I think is very UN unpredictable in the

29
00:01:30.101 --> 00:01:35.020
sense that like, if he wants to run like X time for a specific race,

30
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.060
that's gonna pull away from his lifestyle so much to focus on that.

31
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.500
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; luckily for him, he's actually a great athlete.

32
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.580
Like you it's it's under that layer of, uh, of fact.

33
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.610
<v 0>Yeah. So people who are not familiar,</v>

34
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.250
bur KRE is a comedian who takes off his shirt often has, has a, uh,

35
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.610
uh, elegant layer of fat around him. He's also a party animal.

36
00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.610
So he's a weird balance of like healthy and unhealthy. Yeah.

37
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.450
So he drinks a lot during, I think there's some debate about that,

38
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.880
but certainly after his, uh, his performances,

39
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:12.680
but at the same time he is into kind of the running thing mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;

40
00:02:12.681 --> 00:02:16.680
and he does quite a bit of treadmill running. I think so. And like I said,

41
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.080
has this challenge of running 2000 miles this year.

42
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.400
So it's fascinating to have somebody who so fully embraces life and the

43
00:02:24.401 --> 00:02:29.190
full joys of life as represe by the huge amounts of drinking and partying

44
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.830
and just being a wild man. But also at the same time,

45
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.030
like being at least curious about this,

46
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.550
challenging yourself in the physical realm, it's kind of fascinating.

47
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.870
It reminds me of, um, one of my favorite comedians,

48
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:46.190
like Eddie Isard mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; who has been doing those challenges.

49
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.020
Oh yeah. Sickly off the couch, just running a, um,

50
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.740
a marathon a day kind of thing.

51
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.740
It's fascinating to see the purity of those challenges

52
00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.160
when like exercise hasn't necessarily been deeply ingrain ingrained

53
00:03:01.161 --> 00:03:04.960
in your life and you kind of just embrace the challenge anyway and take it on.

54
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.200
And that's another way of looking at it.

55
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.000
Cause we've been talking about running as a, a,

56
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.320
a performance like optimization thing where training is such a huge part of

57
00:03:15.321 --> 00:03:15.790
this process.

58
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.310
Like Grace Day is just to cherry on top there's for some people where the race

59
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.950
is the cake. Yeah. It's like they just take it on as a pure challenge as the,

60
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.990
as the, as the thing you haven't really trained for as the thing you haven't,

61
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.470
you don't understand the intricacies of, but you take it on anyway. And that,

62
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.790
that reveals something about the human spirit as well.

63
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.270
<v 1>Yeah. And there's definitely like a switch that flips when you,</v>

64
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.380
in your mind and decide I'm gonna do this. Yeah.

65
00:03:40.381 --> 00:03:43.380
Where then all of a sudden it goes from like you stop thinking about, oh,

66
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.380
that's not possible to be like, well, I'm just gonna do it.

67
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.700
And I think Burt highlights that perfectly in a lot of cases where like, he's,

68
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.220
he's maybe not even thinking it through enough to get to the point where it's

69
00:03:53.221 --> 00:03:53.400
like,

70
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.420
he gets the point where he thinks this is not possible where most people would

71
00:03:56.421 --> 00:03:57.300
look at it and think, huh,

72
00:03:57.301 --> 00:03:59.970
I don't know if I can actually physically accomplish the at task.

73
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.210
Bert's just like, oh yeah, I'm gonna do it. And my,

74
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.410
my thing thought with Bert was the 2000 mile thing. Is,

75
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.370
are we gonna find him at the end of the year with like 36 hours to go on a

76
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:10.570
hundred miles? And he that's right.

77
00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.570
<v 0>That's right. That's what's gonna happen. And it's going to be hilarious.</v>
