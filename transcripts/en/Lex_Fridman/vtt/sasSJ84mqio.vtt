00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.890
<v 0>I have to ask you about KIB. So I remember a while ago Rogan said that, uh,</v>

2
00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:11.650
that's the perfect fight, uh, yeah. For KIB you are,

3
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.890
so let me ask two questions the first,

4
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.250
do you think you can beat him in an MMA match when you're at your peak? Yeah.

5
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.050
<v 1>I, I don't like, uh, yeah, I mean, this is one of those people,</v>

6
00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:25.040
people like we'll get it really mad at me if I say yes, but yeah. I mean, I.

7
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.960
<v 0>But how would you do it? How would you solve that puzzle? Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.280
<v 1>Uh, I mean, we would grapple and I think I would be better than him, but I know,</v>

9
00:00:33.281 --> 00:00:37.440
I, I feel weird saying, cause people, yeah, write your full, you know? And,

10
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.360
but that's no, no one, I grappled him. Right. I mean, nobody did.

11
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.480
And maybe I'm wrong in this, but I will,

12
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.510
if we we'll get the best possible candidates, I'm definitely one of them.

13
00:00:47.511 --> 00:00:49.350
And then obviously I have a small size advantage too.

14
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.190
<v 0>So in a wrestling match.</v>

15
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.390
So we can just reduce that MMA match to a wrestling match.

16
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.070
What do you think is the right strategy on him? Like do,

17
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.390
do you understand his style that the, the, his wrestling style,

18
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.380
the pressure he applies? Do you underst yeah. How the hell he makes.

19
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.140
<v 1>That happen? Yeah, I mean,</v>

20
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.460
he never unfortunately fought any real who I would say really,

21
00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:12.660
really high level wrestlers.

22
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.300
I was actually really disappointed how bad Justin GA's wrestling was.

23
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.340
Cuz Justin GCI had some solid success,

24
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.820
but wrestling was really bad in that fight. Um, GA.

25
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.933
<v 0>Had success in.</v>

26
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.330
<v 1>Okay. Yeah. I think he was seventh plays maybe or somewhere.</v>

27
00:01:26.331 --> 00:01:29.810
He was definitely all American. Uh, it was lower though. Um,

28
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.290
so yeah, I would, I would like to see how he dealt with someone who was like a,

29
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.290
who I think, oh man, this guy's a really high level wrestler. Cause you know,

30
00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:39.370
we saw, and this is early in his career, but you know,

31
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.810
GLA and Tebo did give him some issues earlier in his career. Um,

32
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.760
so I would like to see him in that situ and how he does, I would love to like,

33
00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:49.400
you know, like I'd I just love wrestling and grappling. Like yeah.

34
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.160
I'd love if someone said, Hey, uh, Ben, you know, could be,

35
00:01:52.161 --> 00:01:55.240
wants to roll with you. Okay. I'm there tomorrow. It sounds like a blast.

36
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.203
Let's go.

37
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.120
<v 0>He's probably competitive as hell. Yeah. You're still competitive.</v>

38
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.440
<v 1>I know when to be and when not to be like, you know,</v>

39
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.360
say if I'm going to high school, kids are, are not gonna be competitive.

40
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.830
Cuz then I'm just being a Dick.

41
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.190
<v 0>How would you take 'em down?</v>

42
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.950
<v 1>What, what we were talking about real wrestl, like wrestling, wrestling,</v>

43
00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:15.910
wrestling, wrestling. I would probably try to text single legs and stuff.

44
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.303
Single legs. Yeah.

45
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.310
<v 0>Haven't okay. Not.</v>

46
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.510
<v 1>Not, I mean I, no, I honestly, I, I don't have the slightest clue.</v>

47
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.860
I'd have to feel, I'd feel 'em out. Um, but single legs. No, my best take, well,

48
00:02:26.861 --> 00:02:27.020
people.

49
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.860
<v 0>Talk about his wrestling being really good. Like people that.</v>

50
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.380
<v 1>Trained with a so. Okay. So I, I grilled someone.</v>

51
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.580
I will not say who on ed Ruth thing.

52
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.980
Cause ed Ruth is very elite at folks out wrestling.

53
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.420
He never became great at fighting. Unfortunately wait.

54
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.260
<v 0>Ed Ruth wrestled could beat him. They.</v>

55
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.540
<v 1>Were on the same team for a while. Yeah. Okay.</v>

56
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.450
And there was rumors that could be beat him up. And I said, I gosh, sure.

57
00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:51.050
Can't believe that. And I've heard that that was,

58
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.210
if they were just straight wrestling, ed would get slightly the better of it.

59
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.170
Well.

60
00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.610
<v 0>Edwards is like one of the greats. He's great. He's really.</v>

61
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.160
<v 1>Good. Yeah. So that was what I heard, but in an MMA setting,</v>

62
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.520
because of all the tools that KIB would get him, I don't know.

63
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.680
Uh, it, what, but I agree.

64
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.400
I agree with Rogan on this one that would've been good to see. Yeah.

65
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.520
That would fun. So yeah. KIB wants to work out. I I'd love it. I love,

66
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.440
I love wrestling and grapple.

67
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.950
I don't do much JSU cause I just don't have time for it anymore.

68
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.550
I'm at the wrestling academy, like every single day. Uh, but yeah, I,

69
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.830
I love jujitsu. I did it. And you know, if I didn't have wrestling academy,

70
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.470
I probably would still Besu.
