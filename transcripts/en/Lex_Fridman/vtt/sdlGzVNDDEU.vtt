00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.540
<v 0>So your fight mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; with Jake. Paul. Yeah. Looking back,</v>

2
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.380
you have a, had a little bit of time now. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; uh,

3
00:00:09.381 --> 00:00:10.620
how would you analyze that fight?

4
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.580
<v 1>Uh, well, I mean, the fight specifically, I got cracked with an overhead, right.</v>

5
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.460
So, I mean, it kind of sucks. Um, I would say,

6
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.890
you know, and this is whatever, like I don't, I really don't care. Um,

7
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.730
and everyone's like, why would you make, turn your reputation?

8
00:00:27.731 --> 00:00:29.170
<v 2>It's like, well, I, I wanted to do it.</v>

9
00:00:29.171 --> 00:00:31.690
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I had enjoyable time training and in the buildup,

10
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.490
obviously I wasn't skillful enough to, to get the win. But if I even,

11
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.810
even despite the fact that I know it's gonna ha what happened if someone asked

12
00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:42.490
me to do it again, I probably would've done it again. Mm-hmm you know?

13
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.440
And so the way I was thinking about when I was deciding whether to do it or not,

14
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.720
cause I got the offer, it's like, okay, is this money? It can it change my life?

15
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.640
Yeah, it could.

16
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.720
<v 1>Right. It's not gonna double my net worth, but it it's gonna add significantly.</v>

17
00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:58.120
Make my life easier. Number two is like when I was in high school,

18
00:00:58.121 --> 00:01:00.880
we used to do boxing matches for free just cause we thought it was fun.

19
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.480
We didn't have something going off Friday night.

20
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.230
<v 2>Me and my buddies would get to get other and we had some boxing goes,</v>

21
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.990
I base and we punched each other in the head.

22
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.590
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so it's like for something I think is enjoyable now they're

23
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.270
paying me a whole bunch of money. Yeah, sure. I'll do it.

24
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.190
<v 0>Would you, do you think if you got the rematch, if you did the rematch,</v>

25
00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:19.670
would you, what are the odds you win? Okay.

26
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.150
<v 1>Let's I'm not, probably not very good. I think he's pretty good actually.</v>

27
00:01:22.151 --> 00:01:26.860
And I'm not very good now with P low point for me, because I,

28
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.860
so when I started training for that, I was like 215 pounds,

29
00:01:28.861 --> 00:01:31.060
which is the heavy set of bed. I came off my hip surgery.

30
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.620
I literally like when I said yes, like I'll do it.

31
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.580
Like I had literally started working out like the week before for the first time

32
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.980
in my, you know, instance of surgery. Cause I wasn't able to do anything.

33
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.850
<v 2>So could I, could I better? Yeah. But now after watching him box Tyron,</v>

34
00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:52.290
like if you ask me Ben, can you beat Tyron? Prob probably not. I,

35
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.410
I don't think I can beat Tyron. So in boxing, in inbox. In boxing. Yeah.

36
00:01:56.411 --> 00:01:59.970
So my chances of beating him, you know, and &lt;laugh&gt; watching that card,

37
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.850
it's like, like kind of be fun to box someone who I know sucks,

38
00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:06.600
who I know can beat that. That's what it would be fun, you know?

39
00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:09.360
Cause like the training, that preparation was fun.

40
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.040
But then obviously I got my butt kicked that, that sucked.
