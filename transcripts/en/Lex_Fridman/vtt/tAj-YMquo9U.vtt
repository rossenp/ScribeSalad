00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.410
<v 0>Uh, so I don't know if you're familiar with Donald Hoffman. He has, uh,</v>

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.220
this idea that, uh, in terms of, uh,

3
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.660
the distance we are from being able to know the reality, which is there,

4
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.990
the physics reality is we're actually really, really, really,

5
00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:22.650
really far away from that. Yeah. So like, it's, uh,

6
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.810
I think his ideas that are basically like completely detached from

7
00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:32.540
it. Uh, what's your sense? How close are we to the reality? We'll,

8
00:00:32.541 --> 00:00:37.440
we'll talk about a bunch of ideas about our beliefs in

9
00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:40.500
technology and, and beyond, uh,

10
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.550
but in terms of what is actually real from a physical sense,

11
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.500
how close are we to understanding that.

12
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.770
<v 1>So far, I'm going to use examples from what I do. Okay. So this idea that</v>

13
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.610
we're suspicious of what we actually think is real, is not new. Of course,

14
00:00:58.611 --> 00:01:03.410
it goes back a long time, thousands of years, in fact, and philosophers,

15
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.820
I, I'm not actually technically a philosopher, but I was one,

16
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.570
I'm a, I'm a professor of religious studies. Yeah.

17
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.290
<v 0>What do you introduce yourself at, like at a bar when the bartender asks,</v>

18
00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:16.124
what do you do?

19
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.030
<v 1>I never tell people what I do, especially on airplanes.</v>

20
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.500
It's a bad idea. So generally if they push though, I say, you know,

21
00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:27.800
I'm the chair of philosophy and religion, although I stepped down last year,

22
00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:30.710
so I'm no longer the chair, but, um, I I've,

23
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.650
I have like a master's degree in philosophy and I was a philosophy major and

24
00:01:33.651 --> 00:01:35.720
I've studied flight. I still study philosophy.

25
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.230
So I integrate it into my research. Um, all right.

26
00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:42.680
So this idea that we can't know, uh,

27
00:01:42.681 --> 00:01:46.370
we're suspicious of what we know is called external world skepticism.

28
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.670
That's the official philosophical name for it. Um,

29
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.860
our faculties and our senses don't give us accurate perceptions of what is

30
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.630
there. Okay. Especially at a quantum level or a molecular level. I mean,

31
00:01:59.631 --> 00:02:01.370
that's just obvious. So yeah.

32
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.820
So I think that you're the person you mentioned is correct in that.

33
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.280
I think we're far away from it.

34
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.850
<v 0>I think you're talking about our direct senses, but you know, we have tools,</v>

35
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.400
measurement tools from microscopes to all the tools of astronomy,

36
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.373
because Margie,

37
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.920
that gives us a sense of the big universe and also the sense of the very small.

38
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.200
Do you think there's some other things that are completely sort of

39
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.600
other dimensions or there's ideas of

40
00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:36.740
panpsychism that consciousness permeates all matter that that's,

41
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.570
there's like fundamental forces of physics we're not even aware of yet,

42
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.410
like.

43
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.300
<v 1>Oh, absolutely. I do think, and this is why I write about technology. And, um,</v>

44
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.920
I, I mean,

45
00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:53.480
that's actually what I specialize in is belief in technology with respect to

46
00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:56.210
religion. So in my opinion,

47
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.120
thank goodness for things for technology, because where would we be without it?

48
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:01.751
I mean, frankly,

49
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:06.370
I think that it's like Marshall McLuhan was the person who

50
00:03:06.371 --> 00:03:11.350
said technology is like an extension of our senses and absolutely

51
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:15.880
believe that to be true. I think that we're lucky that we, you know,

52
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.310
that Promethease gave us technology okay.

53
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.510
And that we use it and we're making it better and better and better and better.

54
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.520
And that makes us more efficient. It makes us more efficient as a species.

55
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.700
Um, and like my point is,

56
00:03:31.701 --> 00:03:35.530
is that I think that our instruments,

57
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.260
I mean, I don't want to be a religious technologist. You know, that our, our,

58
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.100
uh, our instruments will save us. I mean,

59
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:47.110
they're already making life better for us.

60
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.470
You think it's important that they also help us understand reality more

61
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:54.820
directly, more deeply? I think directly as a is better than deeply.

62
00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:59.770
I think directly more directly is probably a more accurate term for what

63
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:01.510
you're trying to, I think ask me.
