1
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.540
<v 0>Was it a mistake for the United States to invade Afghanistan in 2001,</v>

2
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.540
20 years ago? Yes. As simple as, yes. Why was it a mistake?

3
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.060
<v 1>I'm an historian. So I say this with, you know,</v>

4
00:00:16.061 --> 00:00:18.700
some humility about what we can though. I think, you know,

5
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.340
I'd still like to know much more about what was going in the white house,

6
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.210
you know, in the hours, days, weeks, you know, after nine 11.

7
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.530
But I think the George W.

8
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.290
Bush administration acted in a state of panic and I think they wanted to show

9
00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:34.970
kind of toughness. They wanted to show some kind of resolve, you know,

10
00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:38.130
this was a horrific act that played out, you know,

11
00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:39.810
on everyone's television screen.

12
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.280
And I think it was really a fundamentally a crisis of legitimacy within the

13
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:45.280
white house than the oval office.

14
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.880
And I think they felt like they had to do something and something dramatic.

15
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.600
<v 2>I think they didn't really think through, you know, who they were fighting,</v>

16
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.400
you know, who the enemy was, what this geography had to do with nine 11.

17
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.960
I think looking back at it, I mean, some of us not to say I was, you know,

18
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.550
clairvoyant or could see into the future, but I think many of us were, you know,

19
00:01:04.551 --> 00:01:07.270
from that morning skeptical about the connections that people were drawing

20
00:01:07.271 --> 00:01:11.350
between Afghanistan as a state, as a place. And, you know,

21
00:01:11.351 --> 00:01:15.350
the actions of Alqaeda in Washington and New York and, and Pennsylvania.

22
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.270
<v 0>So as you watch the events of nine 11,</v>

23
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.750
the things that our leaders were saying in the,

24
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.420
in the minutes, hours, days, weeks that followed,

25
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.380
maybe you can give a little bit of a timeline in of what was being said.

26
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.980
One was the actual invasion of, of Afghanistan. And also,

27
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.860
what were your feelings in the minutes? Weeks after nine 11?

28
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.210
<v 1>I was in DC. I was, you know, I, on the way to American university, uh,</v>

29
00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:51.210
hearing on NPR, what had happened. Um, and I thought of the

30
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.490
American university logo, which is red, white, and blue &lt;laugh&gt;, it's an Eagle.

31
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.890
And I thought, you know,

32
00:01:56.891 --> 00:02:00.970
Washington is under attack and symbols of American power are under attack.

33
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.800
And so, um, you, I, I was quite concerned and at the time lived, you know,

34
00:02:05.801 --> 00:02:10.040
just a few miles from the capital. And so, um, you know, I, I, I felt that,

35
00:02:10.041 --> 00:02:13.520
you know, it was, it was real. So I appreciate the, you know, the,

36
00:02:13.521 --> 00:02:17.920
the sense of anxiety and fear and panic. And for two, three years later in DC,

37
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.720
we were constantly getting reports, you know,

38
00:02:20.721 --> 00:02:24.440
mostly rumors and unconfirmed about all kinds of attacks all the city.

39
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.550
So I definitely, um, appreciate the sense of being under salt,

40
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.150
but in watching television, including Russian television that day. Cause I just,

41
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.270
it just installed a satellite thing.

42
00:02:34.271 --> 00:02:36.310
So I was trying to watch world news and get different points of view.

43
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.750
And that was quite useful to have an alternative, you know,

44
00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:42.190
set of eyes in Russian. Yeah. In Russian. Yeah.

45
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.990
<v 0>Okay. So your Russian is, is, uh, is good enough to understand.</v>

46
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.020
<v 1>Uh, Russian television, the news. Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.740
The news and the visuals that were coming that were not shown on American

48
00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:52.140
television. I don't know how they had it, but they had,

49
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.660
they were not filtering anything in the way that the Metro networks and cable

50
00:02:56.661 --> 00:03:00.160
televisions were doing here. So it was a very unvarnished view of,

51
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.680
of the violence of, of the moment, you know, in New York city of,

52
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.880
of people diving from the towers or being dis you know, and it was really,

53
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.400
they didn't hold back on that, which was quite, you know, fascinating.

54
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:11.960
I think much of the world saw much more than actually the American public saw.

55
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.040
But to your question, you know, amid that feeling of imminent doom,

56
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.870
I watched commentators start to talk about Al-Qaeda and then talk about

57
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.910
Afghanistan. And one of the experts was, um, was born at Ruben. Um,

58
00:03:25.911 --> 00:03:29.710
who's at NYU, who's a, you know, kind of long, very learned, um,

59
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.750
Afghanistan hand. And he's brought on Peter Jennings on ABC news to,

60
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.630
to kind of lay this out for everyone. Um, and I thought, you know,

61
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:38.590
he did a fine job, but it,

62
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.780
I think it was formative in cementing the view that somehow Al-Qaeda was

63
00:03:42.781 --> 00:03:47.140
synonymous with this space Afghanistan. Um, and I think again,

64
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.180
I was no Al Qaeda expert then, and I'm, I'm not now,

65
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.060
but I think my immediate thought went to war.

66
00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.140
And because my background had been with, at that point,

67
00:03:57.141 --> 00:04:00.090
mostly Afghani had been displaced from Doug kids of war,

68
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.170
who I encountered in news, Pakistan who are refugees. And so on.

69
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:04.810
I thought immediately, you know,

70
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:09.050
my mind went to the suffering of Afghan people that this war was going to

71
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.610
sweep, sweep up. Of course, the, the, you know, the defense,

72
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.610
most people who have nothing to do with these politics. So.

73
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.490
<v 0>We should give maybe a little bit of context that you can speak to. Yeah.</v>

74
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.960
So assume nobody's in to put in anything. Yeah. So let's just say, um,

75
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.240
you're you and I are not experts in anything. Right. What as a historian,

76
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:32.400
were you studying at the time and thinking about, see, uh, is it,

77
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.560
is it the full global history of Afghanistan? Is it the region?

78
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.320
Were you thinking about, uh,

79
00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:44.190
the Muji had Dean and Al-Qaeda and Taliban,

80
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.590
were you thinking about the Soviet union, the proxy war through Afghanistan?

81
00:04:49.591 --> 00:04:52.630
Were you thinking about Iraq and oil? Like what,

82
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.830
what's the full space of things in your heart in your mind at the time?

83
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.030
<v 1>I mean, just at the moment, of course it was, you know, there's the,</v>

84
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.220
the sense of you, you know, the suffering and the tragedy of the moment of,

85
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.700
you know, the, what the deaths. And that was, I think I was occupied by,

86
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.140
by the violence of the moment. Um,

87
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.380
but as the conversation turned to Afghanistan as a kind of theater to somehow

88
00:05:13.381 --> 00:05:16.660
respond to this moment, I think immediately what came to mind was that little,

89
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.460
I knew about Al QAA. The times death said that the geography was,

90
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.610
was inaccurate, that this was a, a global network, a global threat,

91
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.050
that this was a kind of, you know, a movement that went beyond borders.

92
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.250
And I think the, it felt early on that Afghanistan was gonna be used as,

93
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.770
as a scapegoat and this intellectually at the time, you know,

94
00:05:34.771 --> 00:05:37.890
I was teaching at American university. My courses, you know,

95
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.890
touched on a range of subjects, but I was trying to complete a book on, um,

96
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.080
Islam and the Russian empire actually mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

97
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.760
But in doing that research, which took me across Russia and central Asia,

98
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.240
purely by accident, I had developed an interest in Afghanistan because, uh,

99
00:05:53.241 --> 00:05:56.880
just again, a series of coincidences, I found myself in touch,

100
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.640
can the capital blue Pakistan, without housing, doing American friend,

101
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.840
who was like the king of the market in touch, Ken, he knew everyone.

102
00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.560
He run into Afghan merchants there.

103
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.880
They found out I didn't have a place to live.

104
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.040
I didn't know where AF Afghanistan was. Honestly, this was 1997.

105
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.400
I had a vague idea. It was next door. Well, you lived in his Pakistan. Yeah.

106
00:06:15.401 --> 00:06:18.630
In TACAN doing, doing just research. Yeah. Cause it was, you know,

107
00:06:18.631 --> 00:06:21.630
hub of the Russian empire in central Asia. Yeah. So just by accident,

108
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.110
ended up with these young Afghans who took me in as roommates.

109
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.190
And that I think that the sense of that community shaped my idea of,

110
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:35.270
of what Afghanistan is. It was my first exposure to them. They're a part of a,

111
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.820
a trading ASRA. They, they had brought matches from RGA Lavia.

112
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.540
They had somehow brought, um, flour and some agricultural products from,

113
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.860
from Egypt. And they were sitting in,

114
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.260
in closed containers in TACAN waiting for these Pakistan state to permit them to

115
00:06:52.261 --> 00:06:54.580
trade. So these guys are mostly hanging out during the day.

116
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:55.580
They would get dressed up,

117
00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:59.010
they would put on suits and ties like you they'd Polish their shoes.

118
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.290
And they would sit around offices, drink tea

119
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.810
Satio then they had feast at lunch. Um, and then at night we would go out.

120
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.210
So part of my research, cause I also had a bottleneck at my research.

121
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:15.290
I was going to the sit archives and TACAN mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and because of

122
00:07:15.291 --> 00:07:17.130
the state of who Pakistan, you know,

123
00:07:17.131 --> 00:07:21.200
that was a very kind of suspicious thing to do. So it took a while to get in.

124
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.160
So I had downtime and touch can just like these guys.

125
00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.280
So I got to know them pretty well, and it was really just a, uh,

126
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.520
an accidental kind of thing, but grew quite close to them.

127
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.360
And I developed an appreciation of, um, which now I think again,

128
00:07:34.361 --> 00:07:35.920
thinking of the seeds of all this, um,

129
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:40.070
these people had already lived young guys, you know, in the twenties,

130
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:41.990
they'd already lived in six or seven countries.

131
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.270
They all spoke half dozen languages. Uh,

132
00:07:45.271 --> 00:07:49.630
one of my best friends there had been a, um, a kickboxer, uh, and break dancer,

133
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:54.110
trained into Iran. His father was a theater person in Afghanistan. Um,

134
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:58.110
he told stories of escaping death in Afghanistan during the civil war

135
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.820
to his Pakistan escaping death there. Um, and these were very, you know,

136
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:04.460
real stories. Can.

137
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:08.660
<v 0>You also just briefly mention yeah. Uh, geographically speaking, yes.</v>

138
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:13.780
Afghanistan, Stan, Stan, you mentioned Iran, right? What,

139
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.860
uh, who are the neighbors of all of this? What,

140
00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:20.130
what are we supposed to be thinking about for people? I, I was all was terrible.

141
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.570
A geography and spatial information. So can you.

142
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:25.570
<v 1>Lay it out? Yeah, no. Sure, sure. So TA Ken, you know, as a,</v>

143
00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.690
as the capital of Pakistan, it was, um,

144
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.970
a hub of Russian Imperial power in the 19th century.

145
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:37.570
The Russians take the city from a local kind of Muslim dynasty in 80 65.

146
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.000
It becomes the city that kind of hub of, um,

147
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:44.240
Soviet power in social Asia after 1917,

148
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:49.080
it becomes the center of the Soviet Republic of Pakistan,

149
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:54.000
which becomes independent finally in 1991 when the Soviet union collapses. So.

150
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:57.960
<v 0>These are all like these, uh, republics are the.</v>

151
00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:01.840
<v 1>Fingertips of Soviet power in central Asia. That's that's right.</v>

152
00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.360
And they've been independent since 1991,

153
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:09.760
but they have struggled to disentangle themselves from Moscow,

154
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:10.703
from one another.

155
00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:16.110
And now they face very serious pressure from China form a kind of periphery of,

156
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:17.250
you know,

157
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:21.550
the great machine that is the Chinese economy and its ambitions to stretch

158
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:26.030
across Asia. Um, for Afghanistan where my roommates,

159
00:09:26.031 --> 00:09:28.750
my friends hailed from, um, yeah,

160
00:09:28.751 --> 00:09:33.670
Afghanistan had fallen into civil war in late 1970s

161
00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.100
when left his, tried to seize power there in 1978,

162
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.180
Soviet union then extended from, is Pakistan, you know,

163
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:46.180
crossing the border with its forces in 1979 to try to shore up this left

164
00:09:46.181 --> 00:09:49.580
government that a cease power in, in 1978. Um,

165
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:54.020
and so for central Asians in the wider region, you know, their,

166
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.250
their fate had for some decades been tied to,

167
00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.090
to AF Afghanistan and in a variety of ways,

168
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:02.530
but it became much more connected in 1980s when Soviet red army

169
00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.610
occupied, um, AF Afghanistan for 10 years.

170
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:08.690
And here I refer your listeners and viewers to, um,

171
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:13.010
REO three as the guide to the historically accurate,

172
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:17.760
the accurate the Bible, the Bible of African remember three. Yeah, yeah. As,

173
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.760
as a fantastic, um, window onto the American view of the war, right?

174
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.920
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but for us Afghans, you know,

175
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.720
there are people who fought against the Soviet army, um,

176
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:31.800
but of a certain generation, the guys I knew, you know,

177
00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:36.400
their mission was to survive. And so they fled in waves, you know,

178
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.190
had the millions to Pakistan, to Iran,

179
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.790
some went north into so central Asia later in the 1990s, um,

180
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:45.990
and some were displaced across the planet. So California,

181
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.070
where we're sitting today has a large community that came in the eighties and

182
00:10:50.071 --> 00:10:51.590
nineties in the east bay.
