00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.490
<v 0>What is the most beautiful throw in judo to you?</v>

2
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.930
<v 1>I think UCI ma you know, it's the,</v>

3
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:14.090
it's the one that seems to have the most amplitude that person goes the highest.

4
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.290
You see a leg swing through the middle, uh, the person doing the throw,

5
00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:20.970
there's a leg swinging through the middle. The other person definitely goes,

6
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.600
you know, head over heels, flat on their back. Um,

7
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.080
it's probably the most dynamic, pretty judo.

8
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.200
<v 0>Throw there is. Okay. So it's a single,</v>

9
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.160
you're standing on a single foot and you're raising your other foot in the air

10
00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:36.960
and it's a forward throw, which means the, uh, your,

11
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.200
your back is facing the opponent. But, uh,

12
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:44.790
they kind of both fly through the air and twist who they are. Correct.

13
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.110
Yeah. So how does that throw work?

14
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.350
<v 2>What are the principles behind that throw is one of those throws that, um,</v>

15
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.511
you know,

16
00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:57.430
people can kind of understand how to pick up another human being in sort of

17
00:00:57.431 --> 00:01:01.430
trivial ways, but the H model to me, never quite made sense,

18
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.620
like why it works, that there's a, there's a cork, there's a twisting motion.

19
00:01:06.621 --> 00:01:10.020
Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, there's some involvement of the hip mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

20
00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:10.770
but not,

21
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.540
it's not really a hip throw because the hip is not all the way over,

22
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.620
so it's not, it, it, it's a very confusing throw. &lt;laugh&gt; I'm trying to say,

23
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.833
can you say something.

24
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.340
<v 1>It's probably one of the most difficult throws to learn as well,</v>

25
00:01:23.341 --> 00:01:27.770
because it is so comp legs, you do have to stand on one leg balance on one leg,

26
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.930
you know, swing your other leg through the middle,

27
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.450
hold your opponent up in the air. And as, and it's hard to,

28
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.730
it's hard to make that contact with upper body to your, to your back. You know,

29
00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:42.090
you have to turn your back on the throw as well. So how does it work? Um,

30
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.330
it's definitely sort of a,

31
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.360
a throw you need to start pulling your opponents upper body towards

32
00:01:49.361 --> 00:01:52.320
you, right? So their upper body starts coming towards you.

33
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.720
<v 2>Your legs go towards them as your body starts to go, uh, to,</v>

34
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.400
into the throat. So your head is gonna go left. Let's say your body,

35
00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:04.280
your legs are gonna go to the right, your body's,

36
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.870
your partner's gonna to lean towards you.

37
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.030
And just as you start to get their momentum coming forward,

38
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.230
your leg is gonna sweep up underneath theirs, pick 'em up onto your hip. Right.

39
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.190
And then the finish of the throw is a twist.

40
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.190
And a lot of times the good judoka will leave their feet when they do the throw.

41
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.510
So both bodies are in the air together,

42
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.140
and then the thrower comes down on top of, of the person.

43
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.580
<v 0>Being thrown. So all four feet are in the air. Correct.</v>

44
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.820
So there's just this unstoppable force to it. So you're all in the air. You're,

45
00:02:33.821 --> 00:02:37.740
you're basically doing a role together, correct. Okay.

46
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.380
So who to you is the best Che who has the,

47
00:02:42.381 --> 00:02:43.740
besides yourself? Uh.

48
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.210
<v 1>I'm not gonna lie. There's is plenty of guys at do Shama a lot better than I.</v>

49
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.690
<v 0>Do. Uh, you do have a nice video about Thema online, but, uh, who,</v>

50
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.850
who's a great practitioner of Thema.

51
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.680
<v 1>To you right now? JohE Ohno. Who's two time Olympic gold medalist.</v>

52
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.880
That's his favorite throw. And he there's, uh,

53
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.200
tons of highlight videos on the IGF and Jude fanatics showing how he does his

54
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.440
Zada. And it is quite different than everybody else's. Um,

55
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.680
but it's unstoppable when, when he comes in,

56
00:03:12.681 --> 00:03:15.440
nobody stops it he's won two gold in, in a row at the Olympics.

57
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.350
I think maybe in the last eight years, the guys lost two is, you know,

58
00:03:19.351 --> 00:03:21.510
he's just incredible. So at a very.

59
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.390
<v 0>Competitive division, I guess some 73 kilos. Okay.</v>
