00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.700
<v 0>It seems like it's very difficult to do that for the influenza virus.</v>

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.340
<v 1>So it's really easy to make an old school vaccine.</v>

3
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.220
So the, the way the first influenza vaccines were made,

4
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.060
it was actually Jonas. So worked on them in the forties.

5
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.740
You just grow lots of virus and you grow it in eggs by the way, chicken.

6
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.640
Nice.

7
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.890
<v 0>Literally wait.</v>

8
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.723
<v 1>Wait. Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.010
Embryonated so they get fertilized and there's a 10 or 12 day embryo in it and

10
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:33.490
you put virus in it, it grows up and then you harvest it.

11
00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:37.090
You get about 10 MLS of fluid, and then you take that,

12
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.930
you treat it with from aldehyde or formalin and it inactivates the virus.

13
00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:45.840
So it's no longer infectious &lt;affirmative&gt; and you just inject that into people.

14
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.640
And that was the first flu vaccine it was made for the, the us army actually.

15
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.320
And then it got moved over to people. We still use that old school tech today.

16
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.680
<v 0>So you're, you're taking, can you help me out here? Okay.</v>

17
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.520
So this is good time to talk about vaccines. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; okay.

18
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.870
So you're talking about, you're taking the actual virus, right?

19
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.110
You put it in an egg, you let it grow up.

20
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.990
It's very funny that you put it in an egg. It's very, um, it's very poetic.

21
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.310
<v 2>Uh, and then, uh, how do you make it not, um,</v>

22
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.270
infectious, not effective or whatever, not infectious, not infectious.

23
00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:26.580
Is that the right term here? Yeah. So how do you make it? Not infectious?

24
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.513
You can.

25
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.620
<v 1>Treat it with any number of chemicals. That'll disrupt the particle.</v>

26
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.260
So it no longer impacts.

27
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.860
<v 0>So that, that step of disrupting the particle,</v>

28
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.900
is that very specific to a, a particular variant particle? No.

29
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.220
<v 1>The same collection of chemicals you can use for all kinds of gotcha. And are,</v>

30
00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:47.610
which have been used for SARS. COVID two vaccines also. So same.

31
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.290
<v 0>Technology. Okay. So what are, there are several things to ask?</v>

32
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.290
So you called it old school in a way that's, uh, slightly dismissive.

33
00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:59.930
Like people talk about windows 98 or something. &lt;laugh&gt; uh &lt;laugh&gt; uh, so there,

34
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.410
so is there risks involved with it or is it just difficult to produce large

35
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:05.450
amounts? No, it's.

36
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.160
<v 1>It's a lot of eggs. It's very easy. I mean,</v>

37
00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:11.120
you could do it in cells and culture, but eggs were convenient and it,

38
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.960
in the 1940s, we didn't have cells in culture. We didn't know how to do that.

39
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.160
So we had to use something else it's easy to do.

40
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.960
But the process of in activating the virus with a chemical makes

41
00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:26.870
it not a best vaccine.

42
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.190
You can make the flu vaccines that we have today,

43
00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:32.310
which are mostly based on this, uh,

44
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.430
inactivation it's called inactivated virus vaccines. Oh.

45
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.430
<v 0>So like the kind of, uh,</v>

46
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.950
thing it presents to the immune system to train on is not, is not,

47
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.060
is not com it's not close to the act virus.

48
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.220
<v 1>Yes. That's what we think.</v>

49
00:02:48.221 --> 00:02:51.860
So that's why probably the flu vaccines are just not very good, you know,

50
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.700
60% efficiency at the best. Right. Which is not really good.

51
00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.520
<v 0>What, what does it mean? What is the.</v>

52
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.000
<v 1>Measure of efficiency for a vaccine? Well, it,</v>

53
00:03:03.001 --> 00:03:07.520
how it does in the general population at preventing influenza at preventing

54
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.560
illness, not infection,

55
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.520
we usually don't measure infection when we're testing a vaccine,

56
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.080
we just measure sickness. That's really easy to score, right?

57
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.470
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you, you, you do a trial and you say, if you feel sick,

58
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:21.110
give us a call.
