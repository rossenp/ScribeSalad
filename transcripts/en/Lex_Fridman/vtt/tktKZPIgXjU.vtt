WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.990
<v 0>I got to ask you, some people think that, uh,</v>

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.270
many of the observations he had describing could be described by a

3
00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:16.650
primordial black hole first, what is a primordial black hole.

4
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:18.270
And what do you think about this idea? Yeah.

5
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.930
<v 1>So primordial black hole is a black hole,</v>

6
00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:25.920
which has made not through the usual pathway of making a black hole,

7
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.920
um, which is that you have a star, which is a more massive than, you know,

8
00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:35.010
1.4 or so solar masses.

9
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.030
And basically when it runs out of fuel, uh,

10
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.800
runs out of its nuclear fusion fuel, it can't hold itself up anymore.

11
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:47.940
And just the whole thing collapses on itself. Right. And you create a,

12
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.840
um, I mean, one, I guess,

13
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.760
simple way to think about it as you create an object with zero radius that has

14
00:00:56.761 --> 00:00:59.850
mass, but zero radius singularity.

15
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.570
Now that's such black holes exist all over the place and the galaxy there's in

16
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:11.220
fact, a really big one at the center of the galaxy that sacrifice that,

17
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.570
that one's always looking at you when you're not looking right. And it's,

18
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.880
it's always talking about you and when you turn.

19
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.700
<v 0>Off the lights, it's it, it wakes up that's right.</v>

20
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.860
<v 1>Um, you know, so such black holes are all over the place. We,</v>

21
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.990
when they merge, we get to see, you know,

22
00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:30.690
incredible gravitational waves that they emit, et cetera, et cetera.

23
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.240
One kind of plausible scenario. However,

24
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.440
is that when the universe was forming, basically during the big bang,

25
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.870
you created a whole spectrum of black holes, uh,

26
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.610
some with masses of five earth masses, masses of 10 earth masses,

27
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.550
like the entire mass spectrum size,

28
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.410
the ma some the massive asteroids now on the

29
00:01:55.411 --> 00:01:58.350
smaller end, over the lifetime of the universe,

30
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.220
the smaller ones kind of evaporate. Uh, and they're not there anymore.

31
00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:06.750
At least this is what we, uh, what the calculations tell us. Uh,

32
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.380
but five earth masses is big enough to not have evaporated.

33
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.850
So one idea is that planet nine is not a planet.

34
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.140
And instead it is a five earth mass black hole.

35
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.850
And that's why it's hard to find now, um,

36
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.610
can we right away from our calculations say that's definitely true,

37
00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:32.100
or that's not true. Absolutely not. We can't. In fact,

38
00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:36.780
our calculations tell you nothing other than the

39
00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:41.730
orbit and the mass. And that means the black hole.

40
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.700
I mean, it could be a five earth mass, you know, cup.

41
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.360
It could be a five earth mass hedgehog or a black hole,

42
00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:52.980
or really anything that's five earth masses will do because the gravity of a

43
00:02:52.981 --> 00:02:57.000
black hole is no different than the gravity of a planet. Right?

44
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.970
If the sun became a black hole tomorrow, it would be dark,

45
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.620
but the earth would keep orbiting it. And like this notion that oh,

46
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:08.230
black holes suck everything in it. It's, it's not,

47
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.210
that's like a scifi notion I should.

48
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.580
<v 0>What would be the difference between a black hole and a planet in terms of</v>

49
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:16.600
observationally.

50
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.310
<v 1>Uh, observationally,</v>

51
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:22.000
the difference would be that you will never find the black hole, right?

52
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.920
The truth is they're kind of, um, I'm actually not, you know,

53
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.980
I never looked into this very carefully, but there,

54
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.980
there are some constraints that you can get just statistically say,

55
00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:38.290
okay, if the sun has a binary companion,

56
00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:40.330
which is a five earth mass black hole,

57
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.340
then that means blood such black holes would be extremely common.

58
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.940
And, you know, you can sort of look for Lenzing events and then you say, okay,

59
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:52.150
maybe that's not so likely, but you know, that said,

60
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.370
I want to emphasize that there's a limit to what our calculations, uh,

61
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.130
can tell you that's do orbit in the mess. So.

62
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.740
<v 0>So I think there's a bunch like ed Witten,</v>

63
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.690
I think wishes it's a black hole because I think one exciting things

64
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:12.400
about black holes in our solar system is that we can go there and we

65
00:04:12.401 --> 00:04:14.890
can maybe study the singularity somehow,

66
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.020
because that allows us to understand some fundamental things about physics, if,

67
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.190
um, it's a planet. So planet nine, we may not, you know, and we go there,

68
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.180
we may not discover anything profoundly new.

69
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.560
The interesting thing,

70
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.490
perhaps you can correct me about planet nine is like the big picture of it,

71
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.240
the whole big story of the type of belt and all those kinds of things.

72
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.860
It's not that planet nine will be somehow fundamentally different from,

73
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.900
um, from, I don't know, Neptune in terms of, um,

74
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.120
in terms of the kinds of things we can learn from it.

75
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.480
So I think that there's kind of a hope that it's a black hole because it's an

76
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.960
entirely new kind of object. Maybe you can correct me.

77
00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.920
<v 1>Oh yeah. I mean, uh,</v>

78
00:04:57.921 --> 00:05:02.020
of course here my own biases creep in because I'm interested

79
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.690
in planets around other stars.

80
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.740
And I would say I would disagree that, you know,

81
00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:13.150
we wouldn't find things that would be truly, you know,

82
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.520
fundamentally new. Um, because as it turns out, the,

83
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.180
the galaxy is really good at making five or three earth mass

84
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.410
objects, right?

85
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.570
The most common type of planet that we see that we

86
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.450
discover orbiting around other stars.

87
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.110
There's a few earth masses in the solar system. There's no analog for that,

88
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.090
right. We go from one earth mass object,

89
00:05:37.091 --> 00:05:41.290
which is this one and two skipping to Neptune and Uranus,

90
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.160
which themselves are actually relatively poorly understood. I would say,

91
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.580
especially Uranus from the interior structure point of view,

92
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.190
if planet nine is a planet going there will give us the closest window

93
00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:58.850
and to understanding what other planets look like. And, um,

94
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.420
I will, you know, I'll say this, that, you know,

95
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.860
planets kind of in terms of their complexity on some logarithmic scale

96
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.360
fall somewhere between a star and an insect, right.

97
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.130
And the insect is way more complicated than a star, right. Uh,

98
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.080
and just all kinds of physical processes and really biochemical processes

99
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:25.880
that occur inside of an insect that just make a

100
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:27.530
star look like, you know,

101
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.540
somebody who is like playing with the spring or something. Right. So the,

102
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.980
I think, you know, it would be, you know, arguably,

103
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.180
you know, more interesting to go to, um, you know,

104
00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:44.660
to go to planet nine, if it's a planet because black holes are simple,

105
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:45.523
they're just kind of,

106
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.330
they're basically macroscopic like particles. Yeah.

107
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.450
<v 0>Um, just like a starlet, you mentioned terms of complexity.</v>

108
00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:55.580
So it is possible that planet nine,

109
00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:00.650
as opposed to being like homogeneous is like super like heterogeneous as a bunch

110
00:07:00.651 --> 00:07:04.730
of cool stuff going on that could give us intuition. I never thought about that.

111
00:07:04.731 --> 00:07:09.170
That it's just basically earth number two in terms of size

112
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.850
and gives us stars giving us intuition that could be generalizable to

113
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.790
Earth-like planets elsewhere in the galaxy.

114
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:22.100
<v 1>Pluto is also in the sense, like, you know, Pluto's a tiny, tiny thing,</v>

115
00:07:22.101 --> 00:07:25.790
right? Just like you would imagine that it's just a tiny ball of ice,

116
00:07:25.791 --> 00:07:27.800
like who cares? But the new horizons,

117
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.690
images of Pluto reveals so much remarkable structure, right.

118
00:07:32.691 --> 00:07:36.920
They reveal glaciers flowing, and these are glaciers not made out of water ice,

119
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.420
but you know, COI ice.

120
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.290
It turns out at those temperatures right.

121
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:47.060
Of like 40 or so Kelvin water, ice looks like metal, right.

122
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.931
It just doesn't flow at all.

123
00:07:47.931 --> 00:07:52.820
But then ice made up of carbon monoxide starts to flow.

124
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.690
I mean, there's just like all kinds of really cool, uh,

125
00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:01.370
phenomena that you otherwise just wouldn't really even imagine, uh,

126
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.600
that occur. So, yeah. I mean, there's a reason why like, planets.

127
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.130
<v 0>Well, let me ask you, I find, uh,</v>

128
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.930
as I read the idea that Edwin was thinking about this kind of stuff,

129
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.790
fascinating. So he he's a mathematical physicist. Uh, who's uh,

130
00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:24.680
very interested in string theory. One, the fields metal, uh,

131
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.450
for his work in mathematics.

132
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.310
So I read that he proposed a fleet of probes accelerated by

133
00:08:31.311 --> 00:08:34.670
radiation pressure that could discover a planet, nine primordial,

134
00:08:34.671 --> 00:08:37.910
black holes location. Uh,

135
00:08:37.911 --> 00:08:40.820
what do you think about this idea of sending a much a probes out there?

136
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:46.190
<v 1>Yeah, look, uh, the way the, the idea is a cool one, right?</v>

137
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:50.150
You go and you say no launch,

138
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:54.830
and basically isotropically you track where they go. And, uh, if I,

139
00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.510
the idea correctly, you basically measure the deflection and you say, okay,

140
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:04.740
that must be something there since the,

141
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.090
the probe trajectories are being altered.

142
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.650
<v 0>So the measurement, the basic sensory mechanism is the,</v>

143
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.690
it's not like gift census on the probes.

144
00:09:12.691 --> 00:09:17.040
It's more like you're because you're very precise, able to capture,

145
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.960
to measure the trajectory of the probes.

146
00:09:18.961 --> 00:09:21.270
You can then in further gravitational fields. And.

147
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.620
<v 1>I think that's the basic idea. Um, you know,</v>

148
00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:30.390
back a few years ago, we had, uh, conversations like these with, um,

149
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.670
you know, engineers from JPL.

150
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.200
They more or less convinced me that this is more,

151
00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:41.970
much more difficult than it seems because you don't at that level of

152
00:09:41.971 --> 00:09:46.140
precision, right. Things like solar flares matter, right.

153
00:09:46.141 --> 00:09:49.080
Solar flares, right. Are completely counter.

154
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:52.770
You can't predict which where a solar flare we'll have them done.

155
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.650
We'll drive radiation, pressure gradients.

156
00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:00.240
You don't know where every single asteroid is. So like actually doing that,

157
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.690
um, problem, I think it's possible, but it's,

158
00:10:04.691 --> 00:10:06.090
it's not a trivial matter.
