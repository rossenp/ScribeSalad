WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.320
<v 0>I have to ask, uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.600
about beautiful artificial life systems or evolution computation systems,

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.840
uh, cellular toda to me,

4
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.600
like I remember it was as a game changer for me early on in life when I saw,

5
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.920
uh, Conway's game of life who recently passed away, unfortunately, uh,

6
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.030
it's it's beautiful. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.

7
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.990
How much complexity can emerge from such simple rules? I, I,

8
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.150
I just don't somehow that simplicity is,

9
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.950
is such a powerful illustration and also humbling because it feels like, uh,

10
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.510
I personally, from my perspective, understand almost nothing about, uh, the,

11
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.780
this world, because,

12
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.660
because like my intuition fails completely how complexity it can emerge from

13
00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:53.420
such simplicity. Like my intuition fails, I think is the biggest problem I have.

14
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.100
<v 2>Um, do you find systems like that? Beautiful. Is there, do you,</v>

15
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.660
do you think about cellular Tom because cellular to don't really have, um,

16
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.770
&lt;affirmative&gt; and many other artificial life systems don't necessarily have an

17
00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:10.690
objective. Maybe, maybe that's the wrong way to say it. Okay.

18
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.730
It's almost like it's just evolving mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and

19
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.330
creating. Yeah.

20
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.810
And there's not even a good definition of what it means to create something

21
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.160
complex and interesting and surprising all those word, as you said. Um,

22
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.320
is there some, some of those systems that you find, uh, beautiful?

23
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.560
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. And, uh, similarly evolution does not have a goal. Uh,</v>

24
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.960
it is responding to, uh, current situation, uh,

25
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.160
and so survival then if it creates more complexity and therefore we have

26
00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:44.960
something that we perceive as program,

27
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.150
but that's not what evolution is inherently, um, set to do. Uh,

28
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.190
and yeah, that's, that's really fascinating how,

29
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.910
how a simple set of rules or simple, uh, mappings can,

30
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.390
um, from, from how from such simple mappings complexity can emerge.

31
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.820
So a question of emergence and self organization, uh, and, um,

32
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.620
the game of life is one of the simplest ones and very visual.

33
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.980
And therefore it drives home the point that it's possible that non-linear,

34
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.740
uh, interactions, uh, and, uh,

35
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.220
and this kinds of complexity can emerge,

36
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:27.330
emerge from them and biology and evolution. It's along the same lines.

37
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.330
We have simple representations DNA, if you really think of it, it's,

38
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.850
it's not that complex. Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, um, it's a long sequence of them.

39
00:02:34.851 --> 00:02:35.651
There's lots of them,

40
00:02:35.651 --> 00:02:39.330
but it's a very simple representation and similar with evolution computation,

41
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.690
whatever string or tree representation we have and the operations, you know,

42
00:02:43.691 --> 00:02:48.560
the amount of code that's required to manipulate those it's

43
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.640
really, really little and, and of course came alive even less.

44
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.000
So how complexity emerges from such simple principles, that's,

45
00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:58.440
that's absolutely fascinating. Um,

46
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.440
the challenge is to be able to control it and guide it and direct it so that

47
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.680
it becomes useful. And like game of life is fascinating to look at and,

48
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.720
and evolution. All the forms that come out is, is fascinating,

49
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:13.200
but can we actually make it useful for us.

50
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.213
<v 0>And efficient,</v>

51
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.360
because if you actually think about each of the cells in the game of life as a

52
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.910
lit organism, there's a lot of death that has to happen to creating anything.

53
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.630
Interesting. Yeah. And so the, I guess the questions for us,

54
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:27.830
humans that are mortal and the life ends quickly,

55
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.150
we wanna kind of hurry up and make sure, uh, we make sure we take evolution,

56
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.030
uh, uh, there's trajectory that is a little bit more efficient than, uh, the.

57
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.620
<v 1>Alternatives touches upon something we talked about earlier.</v>

58
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.060
That evolution competition is very, uh, impatient. Yeah. And we had,

59
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.580
we have a goal. We want it right away. Yeah.

60
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.260
Versus biology has a lot of time and, and deep, deep time and, and, uh,

61
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.540
weak presser and large populations. Uh, one great example of, of this is the,

62
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.140
uh, novelty search mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, uh,

63
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.650
so evolution in where you don't actually specify

64
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.450
a fitness goal, something that is your actual thing that you want,

65
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.290
but you just reward solutions that are different. Yeah.

66
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.090
From what you've seen before. Yeah. Nothing else. Yeah. And you know what,

67
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.490
you actually discover things that are interesting and useful that way. Um,

68
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.840
cuz and Jo did this one study where they actually, um,

69
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.160
tried to evolve walking behavior on robots mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and that's

70
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.361
actually,

71
00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:28.960
we talked about earlier where your robot actually failed in all kinds of ways

72
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.600
and eventually discovered something that was, uh, very efficient walk. Uh, and,

73
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.840
and it was because they, they rewarded things that were different,

74
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.390
that you were able to discover something. Uh, and I think that this is crucial,

75
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.470
um, because in order to be really different from what you already have,

76
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.870
you have to utilize what is there in a domain mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; to create

77
00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:52.990
something really different mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so you have encoded the, uh,

78
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.510
fundamentals of your world and then you make changes to those fundamentals.

79
00:04:57.511 --> 00:05:00.910
You get further away. So that's probably what's happening in,

80
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.860
in these systems of emergence, uh, that, uh, uh,

81
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.460
fundamentals are there. And when you follow those fundamentals,

82
00:05:08.461 --> 00:05:12.500
you get into points. And some of those are actually interesting and useful. Now,

83
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.660
even in that robotic Walker simulation, there was a large set of garbage.

84
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.260
Uh, but among them, there were some of these, you know, gems, uh,

85
00:05:21.261 --> 00:05:24.530
and those are the ones that somehow you have to outside recognize and,

86
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.770
and make useful. Uh, but these kind of productive systems,

87
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.210
if you code them the right kind of principles, um, I think that they, um,

88
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.650
that encode the structure of the, of the domain,

89
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.410
then you will get to these solutions and the discoveries.
