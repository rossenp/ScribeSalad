00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.780
<v 0>What's the greatest science fiction book ever written</v>

2
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.220
removing your, uh, work from consideration.

3
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.020
<v 1>Uh, greatest.</v>

4
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.260
<v 0>I'm I'm loving.</v>

5
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.300
<v 1>Torturing you right now. Greatest ever in non Stevenson, do we include fantasy?</v>

6
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.693
There's have to be science fiction.

7
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.170
<v 0>Oh, interesting fantasy. Hmm.</v>

8
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.810
I, I did not expect that twist, uh, well, in.

9
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.610
<v 1>For, in a weird way, they're a lump together in people's minds. Right. So they.</v>

10
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.130
<v 0>Are, but it they're, but there's also a boundary somehow. Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.450
I'm not sure what that is.

12
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.720
<v 1>Exactly. Nobody is. It's a mystery &lt;laugh&gt; um, so I mean,</v>

13
00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:48.960
if we do include it, then it's easily the, the Lord of the rings. Um, but, um,

14
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.120
I mean, greatness is, uh, interesting quality to, uh,

15
00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:58.960
to try to define. Um, and for me,

16
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.240
uh, a lot of the, the fun and the joy of such books is,

17
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.630
is not an what you'd call greatness, but just storytelling.

18
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.990
So I was always a big fan of, has have space suit we'll travel,

19
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.110
which is a Highline young adult book. It's just, uh, it's just a fun, good read.

20
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.830
Um, so.

21
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.590
<v 0>So, so fun's a big component. Greatness is overrated. Well.</v>

22
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.620
<v 1>I don't know over rated, but it's just, you know, it's,</v>

23
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.300
it might be under defined. Let's put it that way. &lt;laugh&gt; so.

24
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.340
<v 0>How space it will travel now I definitely have to read that one.</v>
