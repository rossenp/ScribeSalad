WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.220
<v 0>So you talked about diagnostics that scales a possible solution</v>

2
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.900
to, uh, future pandemics. What about another possible solution, which is, uh,

3
00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:14.180
kind of creating a backup copy?

4
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.900
<v 2>You know, I'm actually now, um, uh,</v>

5
00:00:17.901 --> 00:00:21.220
putting together a NAS for a backup for myself for the first time taking backup

6
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.530
of data seriously. Mm &lt;affirmative&gt;. But if we were to take the, uh,

7
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.210
the backup of human consciousness seriously and, uh,

8
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.050
try to expand throughout the, uh, solar system and colonize at the planets,

9
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.770
do you think that's an interesting, uh, solution, one of many,

10
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.770
uh, for, uh, protecting human civilizations from self destruction,

11
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.450
sort of humans becoming a multi planetary species? Oh, absolutely.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.920
<v 1>I mean, I find it electrifying first of all.</v>

13
00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:48.280
So I've got a little bit of a personal bias when I was a kid,

14
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.480
I thought there was nothing cooler than rockets.

15
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.040
I thought there was nothing cooler than NASA.

16
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.480
I thought there was nothing cooler than people walking on the moon.

17
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.800
And as I grew up, um,

18
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.840
I thought there was nothing more tragic than the fact that we went from walking

19
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.670
on the moon to at best getting to something like sub altitude.

20
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:06.390
And just,

21
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.070
I found that more and more depressing with the passage of decades at just the

22
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.070
colossal expense of, you know,

23
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.270
man's space travel and the fact that it seemed that we were unlikely to ever get

24
00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:19.670
back to the moon, let alone Mars.

25
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.350
So I have a boundless appreciation for Elon Musk for many reasons.

26
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.260
The fact that he has put Mars on the incredible agenda is one of the things that

27
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.620
I appreciate immensely.

28
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.860
So there's just this sort of space nerd in me that just says, God, that's cool,

29
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.660
but on a more practical level, we were talking about, you know, uh,

30
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.940
potentially inhabiting planets that aren't our own.

31
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.490
And thinking about a benign civilization that would do that in,

32
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.850
in planetary circumstances where we're not causing other conscious systems to

33
00:01:54.851 --> 00:01:57.730
suffer. I mean, Mars is the place that's very promising.

34
00:01:57.731 --> 00:02:01.090
There may be microbial life there. And I hope there is. And if we found it,

35
00:02:01.091 --> 00:02:02.290
I think it would be electrifying.

36
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.520
But I think ultimately the more judgment would be made that, you know,

37
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.560
the continued thriving of that microbial life is of less concern

38
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.880
than creating a habitable planet to humans,

39
00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:18.240
which would be a project on the many thousands of years scale.

40
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.920
But I don't think that that would be a greatly imoral act.

41
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.280
And if that happened and if Mars became, you know,

42
00:02:25.281 --> 00:02:29.750
home to a self sustaining group of humans that could survive a catastrophic

43
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.950
mistake here on earth, then yeah. The fact that we have a backup colon is great.

44
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.750
And if we could make more, I'm sorry, not backup colony backup copy is great.

45
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.790
And if we could make more and more such backup co copies throughout the solar

46
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.230
system, by hollowing out asteroids and whatever else it is, maybe even Venus,

47
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.620
we can get rid of three quarters of its atmosphere and, you know,

48
00:02:49.621 --> 00:02:52.100
turn it into a tropical paradise. Um,

49
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.780
I think all of that is wonderful now whether we can make the leap from that to

50
00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.600
inter stellar trans transportation with the incredible distances that are

51
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.320
involved. Um, I think that's an open question, but I think if we ever do that,

52
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.120
it would be more like the Pacific

53
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.800
oceans, uh,

54
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.560
channel of human expansion than the Atlantic oceans.

55
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.320
And so what I mean by that is, uh,

56
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.670
when we think about European society transmitting itself across the Atlantic

57
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.590
mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, it's these big ambitious,

58
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.070
crazy expensive one shot expeditions like Columbus mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; to

59
00:03:32.071 --> 00:03:35.750
make it across this enormous expanse. And at least initially without all,

60
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.790
any certainty that there's land on the other end. Right?

61
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.620
So that's kind knew how I view our space program is like big,

62
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.140
you know, very conscious deliberate efforts to get from point a to point B.

63
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.820
If you look at how Pacific Islanders, um,

64
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.580
transmitted, you know,

65
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.340
their descendants and their culture and so forth throughout Polynesian,

66
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.290
beyond it was much more, you know, inhabiting a place,

67
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.650
getting to the point where there were people who were ambitious or unwelcome

68
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:09.770
enough to decide it's time to go off island and find the next one and pray to

69
00:04:09.771 --> 00:04:10.451
find the next one.

70
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:15.450
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that method of transmission didn't happen in a single conf

71
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.930
swift year, but it happened over many, many centuries.

72
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.080
And it was like going from this island at that island and probably for every

73
00:04:22.081 --> 00:04:25.160
expedition that went out to seek another island and actually lucked out and

74
00:04:25.161 --> 00:04:27.520
found one, God knows how many were lost at sea,

75
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.440
but that form of transmission took place over a very long period of time.

76
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.120
And I could see us, you know, perhaps, you know,

77
00:04:34.121 --> 00:04:38.040
going from the inner solar system to the outer solar system, to the hyper belt,

78
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.030
to the ort cloud, you know, there's there theories that there might be,

79
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.470
you know, planets out there that are not anchored to stars, like kind of hop,

80
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.870
hop slowly, transmitting ourselves.

81
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.110
So at some point we're actually in alpha Centuri,

82
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.310
but I think that kind of backup copy and transmission of our physical presence

83
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.990
and our culture to a diversity of, you know,

84
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.420
extra Tores real, um, outposts is a really exciting.

85
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.660
<v 0>Idea. I really never thought about that because I, I have thought</v>

86
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.220
my thinking about space exploration has be very Atlantic ocean centric in a

87
00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:16.220
sense that there would be one program with NASA and maybe private, uh,

88
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.780
Elon Musk, SpaceX, or jet Bezos and so on.

89
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.930
But it's true that with the help of Elon Musk,

90
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.170
making it cheaper and cheaper and more effective to create these technologies

91
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.810
where you could, uh, go into deep space,

92
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.170
perhaps the way we actually economize the solar system. And,

93
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:35.443
um,

94
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.810
and expand out into the galaxy is basically just like these like

95
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.880
Renegade ships of, of, uh, weirdos. &lt;laugh&gt;,

96
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.120
it's just kind of like, like home,

97
00:05:47.121 --> 00:05:50.320
like most of them like quote unquote homemade, uh,

98
00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:54.320
but they just kind of venture out into space and just like, like, you know,

99
00:05:54.321 --> 00:05:55.100
the Android,

100
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.960
the initial Android model of like millions of like these little ships just

101
00:05:58.961 --> 00:06:03.040
flying out, most of them die off, uh, in horrible accidents,

102
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.440
but some of them will, will persist.

103
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.360
There'll be stories of them persisting and over a period of decades and

104
00:06:09.361 --> 00:06:09.841
centuries,

105
00:06:09.841 --> 00:06:14.840
there'll be other attempts almost always as a response to the main set of

106
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:16.240
efforts. That's interesting. Yeah.

107
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.710
You kind of think of Mars colonization as the big NASA Elon Musk effort

108
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.950
of a big colony, but maybe the successful one would be, you know,

109
00:06:25.951 --> 00:06:30.510
like a decade after that, there'll be like a ship from like some kid,

110
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.070
some high school kid who gets together a large team and does something probably

111
00:06:34.071 --> 00:06:38.980
illegal and launches something where they end up actually persisting quite

112
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.740
a bit. And from that learning lessons that, uh, nobody ever gave permission for,

113
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.540
but somehow actually flourish. And, and then take that into the scale of,

114
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.500
um, centuries forward. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; into the,

115
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.380
into the rest of the space. That's really interesting.

116
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.420
<v 1>Yeah. I think, I think the giant steps are likely to be NASA like efforts.</v>

117
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.170
Like there, there is no intermediate rock, well, I guess it's a moon,

118
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.290
but even getting in the moon, ain't that easy between us and Mars, right?

119
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:08.010
So like the giant set steps, the, the big hubs, like the O'Hara airports yeah.

120
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:12.370
Of the future probably will be very deliberate efforts. But then, you know,

121
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:13.210
you would have,

122
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:17.730
I think that kind of diffusion mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; as space travel becomes more

123
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.281
democratized and more capable.

124
00:07:19.281 --> 00:07:23.120
You'll have this sort of natural diffusion of people who kind of wanna be off

125
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.320
grid or think they can make a fortune there, you know,

126
00:07:25.321 --> 00:07:27.640
the kind of mentality that drove people to San Francisco. I mean,

127
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:32.800
San Francisco was not populated as a result of king Ford and an Isabella

128
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.880
like effort to fund Columbus going over.

129
00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:38.990
It was just a whole bunch of people making individuals decisions that there's

130
00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.430
gold than th Hills, and I'm gonna go out and get a piece of it.

131
00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.110
So I could see that kind of future what I can't see.

132
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:48.590
And the reason that I think this Pacific model of transmission is more likely is

133
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:53.310
I just can't see a NASA like effort to go from earth to alpha

134
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.230
Sanur it's just too far.

135
00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:01.340
I just see lots and lots and lots of relatively tiny steps

136
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.220
between now and there. And the fact is that there is,

137
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:09.100
there are large chunks of matter going at least a light year beyond the sun.

138
00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:13.660
I mean the, or cloud, I think extends at least a light year beyond the sun. And,

139
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.340
you know, then maybe there are these untethered planets after that.

140
00:08:16.341 --> 00:08:17.780
We won't really know till we get there.

141
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:23.050
And if our or cloud goes outta light year and alpha cent or cloud goes outta

142
00:08:23.051 --> 00:08:25.690
light year, you've already cut in half the distance mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

143
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.330
you know, so who knows, but yeah.

144
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.570
<v 0>One of the possibilities,</v>

145
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:32.930
probably the cheapest and most effectively to create interesting

146
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:39.530
Intertel spacecraft is, uh, ones that are powered and driven by AI.

147
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:43.200
And you could think of here's where you have high school students be able to

148
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:49.680
build a, sort of a, how 9,000 version of modern version of that.

149
00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.200
And it's kind of interesting to think about &lt;laugh&gt; these, uh,

150
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:58.480
robots traveling out throughout perhaps perhaps

151
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:02.280
sadly long after human civilization is gone.

152
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:07.240
There would be these intelligent robots flying throughout space and perhaps

153
00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:11.680
land on, uh, office entire B or, and of those kinds of planets and,

154
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.360
uh, and colonize sort

155
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.270
humanity continues through the

156
00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.070
proliferation of our creations, like, uh,

157
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:29.070
like robotic creations that have some echoes of that, uh, intelligence,

158
00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.190
hopefully also the consciousness.
