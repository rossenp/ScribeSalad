00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.770
<v 0>Pamela McCormick has this quote that I like I'll talk to her a couple of years</v>

2
00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:11.280
ago, or I guess already in this podcast that, um,

3
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.280
that artificial intelligence began with Angela wish to forge the gods.

4
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.440
So do you think artificial intelligence

5
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.000
may become the very kind of

6
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.060
gods that, uh,

7
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.230
where the center of our, the religions of most of our history?

8
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.070
<v 1>Yeah, there's a lot there.</v>

9
00:00:37.071 --> 00:00:41.840
So I'm going to start by addressing this idea of

10
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.490
artificial intelligence being separate from human beings. Okay.

11
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.740
So I don't think that's actually, that might happen. Okay.

12
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.140
I mean, it's already happened, but let's put it this way.

13
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.480
Like you're talking about super artificial intelligence,

14
00:00:56.481 --> 00:01:01.430
like autonomous conscious artificial intelligence. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

15
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.260
Well the artificial cautiousness, uh, first of all, I, I think she's correct.

16
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.400
Okay. But also there's an awesome quote. Um,

17
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.140
I'd also like to bring up this, uh, writer of fiction actually,

18
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.250
um, Ted Chang and his, one of his essays. He writes short essays.

19
00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:23.330
One of them was the basis for the movie arrival, which if you haven't seen it,

20
00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:27.940
it's a really great movie about UFO's. Uh,

21
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:28.783
and.

22
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.590
<v 0>It has a very creative way of proposing an idea of how they might be able to</v>

23
00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:38.270
communicate how w w w first of all, how they appear to us, second of all,

24
00:01:38.271 --> 00:01:40.820
how they may be communicating with us humans.

25
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.260
<v 1>Exactly. Um, the author, Ted chain has a lot.</v>

26
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.250
I recommend his, his writings, his short stories. Um,

27
00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:53.720
one is very short and it appeared as it appeared in

28
00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:57.440
nature about 20 years ago. And it is called,

29
00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.090
I think it's called getting,

30
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.280
eating the crumbs from the table or something like that.

31
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.080
And it's basically the short essay. And I hate to do, you know, to,

32
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.250
to do a spoiler here, but if you don't want to know what it's about,

33
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.540
don't listen right now. Yeah. Okay. So this is what it's about.

34
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.170
So basically it's about human beings, uh,

35
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.970
becoming two different species. Okay. And one of them is created,

36
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.890
they're called meta-humans and they start biohacking themselves with tech.

37
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.210
Okay. Sound familiar.

38
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.310
So they do this and they become meta-humans and S another

39
00:02:34.311 --> 00:02:38.750
species. Right. And, you know, just kind of have another fork, um,

40
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.980
such that humans can barely understand them.

41
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.330
Um, because they're so far removed. So in a sense,

42
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.620
are they gods, right? No, they're meta-humans are superhumans.

43
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.820
They're enhanced humans. Okay. I see that hopefully on the horizon, frankly.

44
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.250
I hope so. Not that we have two species,

45
00:02:58.251 --> 00:03:01.270
but that we can use our technology or we can,

46
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.760
we can become so integrated with our technology that we can

47
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:10.300
survive. Okay. We can survive. The radiation is space.

48
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.090
We can't go places now because of the radiation in space,

49
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.980
perhaps we can develop our bodies such that we can survive the radiation in

50
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:20.710
space. So there, there's this idea of these meta-humans.

51
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:25.540
Now there's also this idea that technology is just another

52
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:28.150
form of humans. We've created it. Right.

53
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.190
And so maybe it is bent on surviving, thereby using us,

54
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.730
you know, kind of as a meme or a team. Some people are calling them teams.

55
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:39.130
Now these self-generating, uh,

56
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.600
they're replicating themselves through us. Okay. I see that also.

57
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:46.270
And I don't think that's terribly bad.

58
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.040
Maybe it's just the way that we are evolving. It doesn't mean that the,

59
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.850
you know, we're evolving all the time. Like we're taller than we used to be.

60
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:58.120
You know, we have different skills and, you know,

61
00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:00.850
so I don't see that as, as a bad thing.

62
00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:04.810
I think a lot of people see it as if we're not how we are now is a tragedy,

63
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.440
but it's not a tragedy how we are now is actually a tragedy for most people

64
00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:09.270
alive.

65
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.210
<v 0>Yeah. And that we might be evolving ways we can't possibly have perceive,</v>

66
00:04:12.211 --> 00:04:13.650
like you said, that, uh,

67
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.420
the humans have created Twitter and Twitter may be changing us

68
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.950
in ways that we can't even understand. Now currently,

69
00:04:22.951 --> 00:04:24.690
like from a perspective of,

70
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.270
if you look at the entirety of the network of Twitter,

71
00:04:27.271 --> 00:04:29.880
that might be an organism that this,

72
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.650
now the organism understands what's happening from

73
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.910
its level of perception. But we,

74
00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:42.300
humans are just like the cells of the human body who are interacting

75
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.980
individually. But like,

76
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.380
we're not actually aware of the big picture that's happening.

77
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.030
And we naturally somehow,

78
00:04:48.031 --> 00:04:52.590
or whatever the force that's creating the entirety of this, whatever. Uh, one,

79
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.100
um, one version of it is the evolutionary process, like biological evolution,

80
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.450
whatever force that is,

81
00:05:00.451 --> 00:05:03.240
is just creating these greater and greater level of complexity.

82
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.130
And maybe somehow not other kinds of non-human intelligence are

83
00:05:08.131 --> 00:05:11.010
involved that we're calling alien intelligences.
