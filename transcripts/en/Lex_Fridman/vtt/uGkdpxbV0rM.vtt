1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.930
<v 0>What do you think beliefs are in themselves can become reality? I mean, so,</v>

2
00:00:06.931 --> 00:00:08.940
so you've now adapted the,

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.480
in this little bit of a conversation adapted the metaphysician view of reality,

4
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:18.930
which is the physics, but, you know, we,

5
00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:22.980
humans kind of operate in the space of ideas very much. So like,

6
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.490
we've kind of in the collective intelligence of human beings have come up with a

7
00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:31.050
set of ideas that persist in the minds of these many people and they

8
00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:33.180
become quite strong and powerful,

9
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.150
like in terms of like impact on our lives,

10
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.190
they can have sometimes more impact than this table does

11
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.990
than the physics. Yeah. And in that sense, is,

12
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.790
is there some sense in which our beliefs are reality,

13
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.440
even if they're not connected to.

14
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.040
<v 1>Yes. Even if they're not real. Yeah. Even if, okay. So yes, absolutely. So,</v>

15
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.480
um, our beliefs are tremendously. They, uh,

16
00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:05.510
they create social effects. Absolutely. Um,

17
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.140
there was a belief that I'm gonna use this example.

18
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.270
There was a belief back in the day,

19
00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:13.640
and then we're talking about when I say back in the day on my story.

20
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.070
And so I'm talking about like a thousand years ago, right.

21
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.810
That women had no souls. Okay. So look, I don't know if human beings have souls.

22
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.450
I can tell you this though, that if human beings have souls,

23
00:01:23.451 --> 00:01:26.420
probably animals do too. That's my own personal belief.

24
00:01:26.421 --> 00:01:29.030
That's not a professor belief there. Um,

25
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.290
but there was this belief among the Catholic, um, magisterium,

26
00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:36.320
which is runs Europe, that women had no soul.

27
00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:39.320
So they had to have this big meeting about it, you know, did women have souls,

28
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.570
but that belief had consequences for women. I mean,

29
00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:48.890
women were treated and have been treated as if they didn't have souls.

30
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.930
Um, okay. So there's, the soul.

31
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.880
<v 0>Was really the essence as a human.</v>

32
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.570
<v 1>Being. It was it's the it's called the animus. Right? It's what is the,</v>

33
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.920
the essence of what is he, is he eternal? You know, when we women we're eternal,

34
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.460
here's another example. Okay. This is an example from my own research.

35
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.980
All right. So there in the Catholic tradition,

36
00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:11.210
there's this idea of purgatory hell and heaven.

37
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.710
And these are three destinations that people can go to when they die.

38
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.930
And if you're great,

39
00:02:17.931 --> 00:02:22.040
you go to heaven automatically and you're considered a Saint. If you're okay,

40
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.510
you go to purgatory, right.

41
00:02:23.511 --> 00:02:27.200
And you suffer for a time and then get back into heaven. Um, if you're terrible,

42
00:02:27.201 --> 00:02:29.330
you go to hell. Right? Okay. Well,

43
00:02:29.331 --> 00:02:33.350
there was a place that the Catholics determined and this,

44
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.350
this was a belief for a long time, like a thousand years or more. Um,

45
00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:40.220
and it was called limbo. All right.

46
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.850
And limbo comes from the Latin limbus and it means edge.

47
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.330
And it was either on the edge of hell or on the edge of heaven.

48
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.630
No one really could determine which it was no historians are like, well,

49
00:02:50.631 --> 00:02:54.320
this person says it was on the edge of heaven. Well, listen, um,

50
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.120
this was a terrible, first of all, there is no limbo anymore. In 2007, um,

51
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.000
Benedict the, then Pope got rid of the idea that there was limbo. Okay.

52
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:06.910
So Catholics kind of went crazy because they didn't really know.

53
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:10.360
They forgot that limbo existed and they thought it was purgatory. And they said,

54
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:11.710
how could you get rid of purgatory?

55
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.110
But actually he just got rid of this idea of limbo.

56
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.400
<v 0>So that's a distinct thing from purgatory. And by the way,</v>

57
00:03:17.401 --> 00:03:20.810
people should know you, they have a book on purgatory. This can be for a.

58
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.500
<v 1>American cosmic. Yes. I wrote a book on purgatory. Yeah.</v>

59
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.520
<v 0>Anyway, so limbo is a distinct thing from purgatory.</v>

60
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.833
<v 1>And the, the,</v>

61
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.520
the types of people who go to limbo happened to be

62
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.860
virtuous pagans. Okay. Like Socrates or somebody like that. Um,

63
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.720
and children who weren't baptized. So think of this, think of,

64
00:03:42.721 --> 00:03:45.270
for like more than a thousand years,

65
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.250
mothers and fathers gave birth to babies who weren't baptized

66
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.960
and couldn't be buried with their family in these burial. And, you know, they,

67
00:03:54.961 --> 00:03:57.090
then they couldn't be reunited with them in heaven.

68
00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.990
Think of the pain and suffering that, that caused and now was nothing.

69
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.270
Limbos nothing yet the belief in it caused untold suffering.

70
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.040
And that's just a small example.

71
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.470
<v 0>And that was as real to them. It was.</v>

72
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.620
<v 1>Absolutely real. I mean, the effects were realists. Put it that way,</v>

73
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.570
the place itself, not real.

74
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.980
<v 0>But the families themselves.</v>

75
00:04:16.981 --> 00:04:21.120
Do you think they really believed it as totally believed it as much as the table

76
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.660
is real?

77
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.920
<v 1>Yes. I've read that. Listen, we've triggered warranties today, right.</v>

78
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.430
So don't read this. It's going to make you upset. Okay. History,

79
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.870
primary sources, no trigger warnings. Okay. So you're going through like,

80
00:04:33.871 --> 00:04:34.171
you know,

81
00:04:34.171 --> 00:04:39.060
somebody's diary from 1400 and you hear the suffering and pain

82
00:04:39.061 --> 00:04:39.894
that they went through.

83
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.730
There were times in my research where I'd have to put my primary source down,

84
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.361
you know,

85
00:04:45.361 --> 00:04:49.380
and just basically go outside and take a walk because it was so horrific.

86
00:04:49.381 --> 00:04:52.170
I knew it was true because they wouldn't write something. You know,

87
00:04:52.171 --> 00:04:55.110
they're not going to write in their diary, something that's not true.

88
00:04:55.111 --> 00:04:56.340
And it was horrible. So yes,

89
00:04:56.341 --> 00:04:59.850
these people went through untold suffering for nothing for, you know,

90
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.300
because they had an erroneous belief, but they didn't know it was erroneous.

91
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.090
So it was real to them. Yeah.
