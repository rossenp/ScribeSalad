00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.390
<v 0>Well, you've written about Gerald dreams of sushi. Um, it's just a really clean,</v>

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.470
good example that people are aware of, of mastery in the,

3
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.110
in the art of the simple in food. Uh,

4
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.910
what do you make of that kind of obsessive pursuit of perfection? In, in,

5
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.030
in creating simple food.

6
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.820
<v 1>Sushi is about perfection, but it's a bit like the Beatles white album,</v>

7
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.860
which people think is simple and not overproduced. Yeah. It's in a funny way,

8
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.300
their most overproduced album, but it's produced just perfectly.

9
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.353
It sounds simple.

10
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.540
It's really hard to produce music to the point where it's gonna sound so simple

11
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.380
and not sound like sludge. Like let it be album has some great song,

12
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.170
but a lot of it sounds like sludge one after 9 0 9 that sludge,

13
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.250
I dig a POY eat sludge. Like it's a bit interesting. It's not that good.

14
00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:54.690
It doesn't sound that good white album, like the best half,

15
00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:58.450
like dear prudence sounds perfect. Sounds simple cry, baby cry.

16
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.810
It's not simple back in the USSR super complex.

17
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.000
So sushi's like that. It's because it's so incredibly not simple.

18
00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:11.560
Starting with the rice, you try to refine it to make it appear super simple.

19
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.480
And that's the most complex thing of all.

20
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.600
<v 0>So do you admire, I mean, we're not talking about days,</v>

21
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:20.680
weeks, months,

22
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.870
we're talking about years generations of doing this same thing over and over and

23
00:01:25.871 --> 00:01:30.550
over again. Do you admire that kind of sticking to the does that, you know,

24
00:01:30.551 --> 00:01:34.590
we talked about our admiration of the weird, that doesn't feel weird.

25
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.030
That seems like discipline and dedication to like, um, uh,

26
00:01:40.031 --> 00:01:41.870
like a stoic minimalism or.

27
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.950
<v 1>Something like that. I'm happy they do it, but I actually feel bad about,</v>

28
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.420
I feel they're sacrificial victims to me, which I benefit from,

29
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.380
but don't you ever think like, gee, you're a great master sushi, sushi chef,

30
00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:58.780
wouldn't you be happier if you did something else? Uh,

31
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.340
doesn't seem to happen.

32
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.940
<v 0>That might be something that a weird mind.</v>

33
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.010
<v 1>Maybe it is weird people and maybe there really enjoying it,</v>

34
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.610
but like to learn how to pack rice for 10 years before they let you do anything

35
00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:14.850
else. It's like these Indian, you know, ode players,

36
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.090
they just spend five years tapping out rhythms before they're allowed to touch

37
00:02:19.091 --> 00:02:21.250
their instruments. Well.

38
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.050
<v 0>Actually, to, to defend that it's kinda.</v>

39
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.010
<v 1>Like graduate school, right? &lt;laugh&gt; well.</v>

40
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.840
<v 0>Well, I think graduate school, perhaps I, um,</v>

41
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.240
graduate school is full of like every single day is full of surprises.

42
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.480
I would say, uh, I, I did martial arts for a long time.

43
00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:43.800
I do martial arts and I've always loved kind of the Russian way of drilling

44
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.120
is doing the same technique.

45
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.030
I don't know if this applies in intellectual or academic disciplines where you

46
00:02:51.031 --> 00:02:55.750
can do the same thing over and over and over again, thousands and thousands.

47
00:02:55.751 --> 00:02:56.710
And thousands of times,

48
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.320
what I've discovered through that process is you get

49
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:07.000
to start to appreciate the tiniest of details and find the beauty in them. Uh,

50
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:09.560
people who go to like monasteries to meditate,

51
00:03:09.561 --> 00:03:14.200
talk about this is when you just sit in silence and don't do anything,

52
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.270
you start to appreciate how much complexity and beauty there is.

53
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.510
And just a movement of a finger.

54
00:03:20.511 --> 00:03:25.510
Like you can spend the whole day joyously thinking about how fun it

55
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:28.070
is to move a finger. &lt;laugh&gt;. Yeah. And so,

56
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.310
and then you can almost become your full,

57
00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:33.990
weird self about the tiniest details of life.

58
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:35.750
<v 1>As a, but then you've gotta wonder like,</v>

59
00:03:35.751 --> 00:03:38.950
is there a free Lunche in there or the rest of us moving around in my.

60
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.100
<v 0>Yeah, exactly. That's they sure feel like they found a free lunch.</v>

61
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.020
The people meditate they're onto something.

62
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.940
<v 1>I tend to think it's like artists that some percent of people are like that,</v>

63
00:03:50.941 --> 00:03:53.900
but most are not. And for most of us there's no free lunch.

64
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.020
Like my free lunch is to move around a lot in search of lunch. In fact.

65
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.370
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; well with all the food talk, it made me hungry.</v>
