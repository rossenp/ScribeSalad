00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.840
<v 0>What do you think about in terms of this co-evolution of, um,</v>

2
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.820
the work around brain computer interfaces and maybe

3
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:14.580
a neuro Lincoln and Elan

4
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.670
seeing Neuralink in particular as, uh,

5
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.620
its longterm mission as a symbiosis with artificial intelligence.

6
00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:30.180
So like giving a greater bandwidth

7
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.010
channel of communication between technology,

8
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.180
AI systems and the biological, uh,

9
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.030
neural networks of our human mind.

10
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.980
What do you think about this idea of connecting directly to the brain

11
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.050
in, in AI systems?

12
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.050
<v 1>I mean, okay. I've, I've listened to your podcasts with Alon.</v>

13
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.490
I've listened to Alon before very Intel, obviously super smart guy. Um,

14
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.650
I think this is already, I mean, not in the specific ways that he is doing it,

15
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.270
but I think we are already doing that. Okay. And I,

16
00:01:06.271 --> 00:01:08.990
I can give you some examples. Um,

17
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.600
and there are really trivial examples,

18
00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:13.910
but they do make the point and this is one of them.

19
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.070
So before he started this research on UFO's and

20
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.690
UAPs and technology,

21
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.730
I actually was looking at the effects of technology

22
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.930
and in particular media on religion.

23
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.730
And what I did was I was lucky to be asked to be a

24
00:01:34.731 --> 00:01:38.690
consultant for various movies. And, uh,

25
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.840
one in particular I learned a lot from, and that was the conjuring.

26
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.190
So I was a history consultant for the conjuring.

27
00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:49.580
It happens to be my field it's Catholic studies. Right.

28
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.640
And you've got these people who are real people and they're, you know,

29
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.610
exercising demons and things like that. Okay. So I thought, wow,

30
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.730
this is a great example for me. You know, I didn't do it for the money.

31
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.760
It doesn't pay well, but I did it to learn, right.

32
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.740
So I work closely with the screenwriters who I work with now all the time with I

33
00:02:06.741 --> 00:02:09.800
work with them all the time now. And what I found was this,

34
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.480
I found that as the most interesting part of the creation of this movie was the

35
00:02:14.481 --> 00:02:17.630
editing process because they would use it,

36
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.680
it would go through editing and they would use test audiences.

37
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.490
And a lot of the test audiences, um, would be like, you know,

38
00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:29.360
there's like these things where they test their flicker rates and things like

39
00:02:29.361 --> 00:02:31.440
that, the eye flicker rates. And so, and,

40
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.610
and when it goes really intense,

41
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.470
they did go to UC Irvine and they do this thing called cognitive consumption,

42
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.860
which is basically, um, or I'm sorry,

43
00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:46.700
cognitive consumerism, where they basically hook,

44
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.710
test audiences up to EKG and they read their brains and they figure out

45
00:02:51.711 --> 00:02:55.320
which scenes create the most. Yeah.

46
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.950
And so they cut out all the other scenes. Okay. So we're getting is,

47
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:03.460
we're getting like this drug when we go to the movies or when we do video games

48
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.290
and when we watch literally physiologically responding to

49
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.660
our technologies, so we're already there,

50
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:14.560
we're already interfacing with them physiologically. So that's my example. Now,

51
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.210
the, the kind of thing that he's doing, uh, Musk is doing with link,

52
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.190
I say, go for it. That's awesome. I hope he does it. You know, I'm fascinated.

53
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.870
I want it to happen. Um, why do I want it to happen? Because I think that,

54
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.680
well, first it's inevitable that it's going to happen. Um,

55
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:36.310
I also want to point out that [inaudible] was trying to get this done back in

56
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.930
the sixties and the seventies. He was writing papers about. In fact,

57
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.740
the ARPANET, the pro pro internet, um,

58
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.920
was called augmentation of the human intellect.

59
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.290
So we've been doing this for a while. Okay. So, um, props to Elon Musk,

60
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.170
but we've been thinking about this for a good time. Um,

61
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.750
we've even been visioning it. Okay.

62
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.520
So there was a really interesting Jesuit priest.

63
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.020
Who's French, uh, tell your day Chardon. I don't know if you know who he is.

64
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.580
If not, he's fascinating. He was a, he was actually a soldier, uh,

65
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.880
before he became a priest. And so he believed,

66
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:18.730
he also saw what he called a biosphere. Now,

67
00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:23.650
this guy is talking in like the early 20th century, like the 1917, 19,

68
00:04:23.651 --> 00:04:26.230
you know, that time period. And so basically he,

69
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.650
he said and wrote about this thing called the newest sphere.

70
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.820
And he basically said there will be a point when we merge with our technology

71
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.700
and it's going to be somewhat like some kind of a biosphere.

72
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.600
We have this atmosphere and then we have the stratosphere and this is going to

73
00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:44.620
be this biosphere. And we're all going to be hooked into it mentally.

74
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.420
So we'll be able to communicate in a way in which we don't communicate now. So,

75
00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:51.610
you know, that sounds so similar to the singularity.
