00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.770
<v 0>Let's go to Kamoo who is maybe less concerned with murder,</v>

2
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.570
more concerned with suicide &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. As a way to explore human nature.

3
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.250
So he is, uh, probably my favorite existentialist,

4
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.610
probably one of the more accessible existentialists.

5
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.050
And like you said, one of the people who did,

6
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.160
didn't like to call himself an existentialist.

7
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.520
So what are your thoughts about Kamo?

8
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.960
What role does he play in this story of existentialism? So.

9
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.120
<v 1>I find Kamo totally fascinating. I, I really do.</v>

10
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.800
And for years I didn't teach KMU because the famous

11
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.960
thing that you're referring to, the myths Sisyphus,

12
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.710
which is a sort of it published as a book, super accessible,

13
00:00:46.711 --> 00:00:48.950
really fascinating. He's a great writer,

14
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.950
really engaging the opening line is something like there is,

15
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.110
but one truly significant philosophical question. Yes.

16
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.470
And that is the question of suicide. Yeah.

17
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.060
And I thought I can't teach my four 18 year olds of, you know, like how &lt;laugh&gt;.

18
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.020
Yeah. I, I, I just thought that's terrible. Like how can I, I mean,

19
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.900
it's not wrong, like, that's a, but do I wanna bring that into the classroom?

20
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.060
And, and so I read it, I read the, the essay. I,

21
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.900
I avoided it for a long time because just because of that line,

22
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.050
and I thought I'm not gonna be able to make sense of this in a way that will be

23
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:29.570
helpful for anyone, but finally, one year, maybe seven or eight years ago, I,

24
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.130
I sat down to read it. I thought I've, I've gotta really confront it.

25
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.130
And I read it and it's incredibly engaging. I mean, it's really,

26
00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:41.570
really beautiful. And, and Kim was against suicide,

27
00:01:41.571 --> 00:01:45.560
which just turns out to be good. &lt;laugh&gt;, you know, like I was happy about that,

28
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.860
but he,

29
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.520
he has a bit of a bleak understanding of what human existence

30
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.720
amounts to. And so, uh,

31
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.640
in the end he thinks that human existence is absurd and it

32
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.720
it's being absurd is a kind of technical term for him.

33
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.700
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and it means that the episodes in your life

34
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.380
and your life as a whole presents itself to you as if it's got a

35
00:02:14.381 --> 00:02:17.780
meaning mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, but really it doesn't &lt;laugh&gt;.

36
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.620
So there's this tension between the way things seem to be

37
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.850
on their surface and what really turns out to be true

38
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.370
about them. And, and he gives these great examples. Like,

39
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.770
you probably remember these, he says, um, there you are, you're walking, uh,

40
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.693
along the,

41
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.250
the street and you there's a plate glass window in a building and through the

42
00:02:41.251 --> 00:02:45.770
window, uh, you, you see somebody talking on a telephone. I mean, we,

43
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.120
I imagine it as, but camu &lt;laugh&gt; didn't &lt;laugh&gt;, uh,

44
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.480
but you see somebody talking on a cell phone and, and he's animated,

45
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.440
he's talking a lot as if things really meant something mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

46
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.280
And yet KEMU says it's a dumb show &lt;laugh&gt;

47
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.920
and it's not dumb in the sense, just in the sense that it's stupid,

48
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.840
it's dumb in the sense that it's silent.

49
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.080
It presents itself as if it's got some significance and yet its significance is

50
00:03:13.081 --> 00:03:15.800
withheld from you. And he says, that's what our lives are. Like,

51
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.830
everything in our lives presents them to us as if it's got a significance,

52
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:24.710
but it doesn't, it's absurd. Uh, and, and then he says,

53
00:03:24.711 --> 00:03:26.550
really what our lives are like, are like,

54
00:03:26.551 --> 00:03:30.630
they're like the lives of OUS just day after day,

55
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.670
you do the same thing. You know, you wake up at a certain time,

56
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.700
you get on the bus, you go to work, you take your lunch, AQ, get off my,

57
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.780
I have a colleague who once said to me, something like this,

58
00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.540
it was about October or so in the fall semester. I said, how's,

59
00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.860
how's it going Dick? He said, well, you know how it is.

60
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.500
I got on the conveyor belt at the beginning of the semester and I'm just going

61
00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:59.970
through and that's, that's the way my life is. And Kam things that,

62
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.650
that experience,

63
00:04:01.651 --> 00:04:06.450
which you can sometimes have reveals something true about what

64
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.170
human lives are like, mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;,

65
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:12.650
our lives really just are like the life of SIS who rolls this Boulder up the

66
00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:14.450
hill from morning, till night.

67
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.210
And then at night he gets to the top and it rolls back down to the bottom,

68
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.060
over the,

69
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.680
the course of the night he walks back down and then he starts it all over again.

70
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.240
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and he says, OUS is condemned to this life.

71
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.400
Like we are condemned to our lives,

72
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.640
but we do have one bit of freedom.

73
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.560
And it's the only thing that we can hang onto.

74
00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.990
It's the freedom to stick it to the odds who put us in this

75
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.030
position, &lt;laugh&gt; by embracing this existence. Yeah.

76
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.670
Rather than giving up and committing suicide. And I, I thought, well,

77
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.950
it's kind of a happy ending &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt;, but, but,

78
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.710
but I also thought it, it, it's a dim view of what our,

79
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.590
our existence amounts to. So I,

80
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.580
I think there's something fascinating about that,

81
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.460
but what I came to believe, and I tried to write about this once.

82
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.940
I know you read the thing about aliveness mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that I published

83
00:05:11.941 --> 00:05:14.860
once that's secretly a criticism of Kamoo.

84
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.460
I don't think I mentioned Kamoo in there,

85
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.500
but I think Kamoo has got the phenomenon wrong,

86
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.530
or he's missed some in important aspect of it. Cuz in Kamoo view,

87
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.730
when you experience your day as sort of going on in this deadening way,

88
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.330
and you're just doing the things that you always do the way you always do them

89
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.930
for Kamoo that reveals the truth about what our lives are.

90
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.370
But I think there's some aspect, at least for me, and maybe,

91
00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.400
maybe he just didn't feel this or didn't have access to it.

92
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.200
Maybe others don't. But for me there's an extra part to it,

93
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.920
which is somehow that yes, that's the way things are

94
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.000
and it's inadequate &lt;laugh&gt; and there's something that's

95
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.800
missing from that aspect of our existence.

96
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.080
That could be there mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and it feels like our lives are not

97
00:06:07.081 --> 00:06:11.640
about just putting up with that and sticking it to the gods by embracing it,

98
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.520
but seeking that absence part of it,

99
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.510
the part that's recognizable in its absence,

100
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.830
in your experience of that. And that's, that's what I think. I,

101
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.110
I think we do have the experience of the presence of that in moments when

102
00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:33.190
you feel truly alive. And that's what you mean by the word aliveness,

103
00:06:33.191 --> 00:06:37.380
which is a fascinating and a powerful word. Yeah. That's what I mean by it.

104
00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.660
I mean,

105
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:42.620
I think most people can recognize moments in their lives when

106
00:06:42.621 --> 00:06:47.580
they really felt alive. And it could happen in a moment when, you know,

107
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:48.501
I don't know,

108
00:06:48.501 --> 00:06:52.100
maybe miles Davis felt it in that moment when he was responding to Herby

109
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:52.940
Hancock's cord,

110
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.420
or maybe you feel it in that moment where you grabbed for the hand,

111
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.280
the first date,

112
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.730
then the gesture is reciprocated mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; or maybe you feel it in

113
00:07:02.731 --> 00:07:07.650
some moment when you are doing a kind of peak athletic

114
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.130
thing or, or watching somebody else do a peak athletic thing. Um,

115
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:16.970
but I think there are moments when we, when it feels like it's not like the way

116
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.560
camu is describing things and it's better because of that.
