00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.360
<v 0>Do you think he should not have been banned from all these platforms?</v>

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.180
<v 1>I don't think, I do think that if you are a private company, right.</v>

3
00:00:11.181 --> 00:00:14.120
I do think, and this is where you run into this problem. Like,

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.420
I don't know if these tech companies were government utilities,

5
00:00:17.421 --> 00:00:21.950
would that decrease people's likelihood of being banned? I don't know. Right.

6
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.760
So I'm, I'm, I,

7
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.000
I understand the benefit of them being treated like public utilities and people

8
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:33.680
thinking they have the right to a Twitter. Um, I've never, I don't know.

9
00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:35.180
I have very little confidence. I mean,

10
00:00:35.181 --> 00:00:37.460
the government is trying to roll out a vaccine in California and we've

11
00:00:37.461 --> 00:00:39.470
vaccinated like five people. I mean,

12
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.890
in terms of what we need to do in the state. Right?

13
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.090
So maybe if it was a government utility, I, I do think someone like Alex Jones,

14
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.530
like there should be some process. So if you're going to get rid of someone,

15
00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:53.450
they should have a way to defend themselves.

16
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.800
There should be more democratic,

17
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.200
a process that you can go through than just being unilaterally

18
00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:06.980
taken off something. But like, then you went into the music.

19
00:01:06.981 --> 00:01:08.480
Am I going to say that everyone does, or no,

20
00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:11.300
if you're threatening or harassing people or threatening to kill them,

21
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.740
publishing their private information.

22
00:01:12.741 --> 00:01:15.350
If you're committing crimes on these platforms,

23
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.170
obviously the people that own these platforms are going to be like, we can't,

24
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.460
we're not gonna allow this to happen.

25
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.810
So I understand that there is a line, right?

26
00:01:23.811 --> 00:01:26.900
There is some people that say there is no line. Aren't really thinking,

27
00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:31.850
like there is a line. I just thought that line seems to be moving all the time.

28
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.760
And it seems to be a very hard thing to police, but I,

29
00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:39.170
I don't think you can remove a guy off everything. And then also bank accounts.

30
00:01:39.171 --> 00:01:41.120
Won't give him debit cards or credit cards.

31
00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:43.610
I don't know if you've talked to him about that, but like, you know,

32
00:01:43.611 --> 00:01:47.390
there were financial institutions that were refusing to let him park his money

33
00:01:47.391 --> 00:01:47.871
there. So, I mean,

34
00:01:47.871 --> 00:01:52.550
it really does get pretty terrifying pretty quickly.

35
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.630
Um.

36
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.090
<v 0>Probably without any transparency from those companies. So you're right there.</v>

37
00:01:57.091 --> 00:02:00.710
It feels like there should be a process of, uh,

38
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.260
just having for him to defend himself.

39
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.630
<v 1>I think there needs to be a process for people to defend themselves. I I,</v>

40
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.540
every day I wake up and I go, can I,

41
00:02:10.541 --> 00:02:13.340
is something I said in a video gonna get taken out of context,

42
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.770
is somebody going to get angry? Is somebody going to be, you know,

43
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.740
I say wild stuff because that's what makes me laugh.

44
00:02:18.741 --> 00:02:21.110
That's what makes my friends laugh. And that's what makes my audience laugh.

45
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.160
So I, I never ever people, I, you know, whatever,

46
00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:27.620
whatever political side you come down on,

47
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.880
I think if you make your living speaking, it's always interesting to me,

48
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.320
if you are pro the D platform, isn't, that's odd.

49
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.760
<v 0>It's interesting to consider a kind of a jury, uh,</v>

50
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.790
con context to where, you know,

51
00:02:43.791 --> 00:02:47.150
there's transparency about why you're video by bombing. Um,

52
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.220
Disney world might be taken down like it's, it's, uh, it gets taken down.

53
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.600
And then there is a, it's almost like creating a little court case. I mean,

54
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.910
mini court case, and not in a legal sense, but in, in the public sphere.

55
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:03.430
And then people should be able to have, you know,

56
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.500
you pick representatives of our current society and have a discussion about that

57
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:10.570
and make a real vote, you know,

58
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.770
just have like jury locks himself up in a discussion that kind of,

59
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.130
that kind of process might be necessary right now.

60
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:21.610
What happens is Twitter is completely, first of all,

61
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:24.280
they're just mostly not aware of everything they're doing.

62
00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:27.070
There's too much stuff, but the stuff they're aware about,

63
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.010
they make the decision in closed doors, uh,

64
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.900
the meetings and without any transparency to the rest of the company,

65
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:39.610
actually, but also transparency to, uh, the rest of the world. And so,

66
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.010
and then all they say is we're doing,

67
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.370
we're making it decisions because the people,

68
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.420
they use things like violence, so violence equals bad.

69
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:52.180
And if this person is quote unquote inciting violence,

70
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.680
therefore that gives us enough reason to bend them without any kind of process.

71
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.160
It's. I mean, it's interesting. I'm, I'm torn in the whole thing.

72
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.030
If it was indeed, there's no transparency about it.

73
00:04:04.031 --> 00:04:08.470
But if parlor was indeed inciting violence,

74
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.240
like if there was brewing, uh, violence, potential violence, where, you know,

75
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.070
thousands of people might die because of some kind of riot

76
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.700
like this, the scary thing about mob,

77
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.180
about when a lot of people get together, right?

78
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.400
Or good people like legitimately good people that love this country that don't

79
00:04:30.401 --> 00:04:33.550
see enemies yet, uh, around them.

80
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.330
But if they get excited together and there's guns involved, it's a problem.

81
00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:41.080
And then some cop gets nervous and shoots one person,

82
00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:44.560
another person shoots the cop, and then there's a lot of shooting involved.

83
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.910
And then it goes from five people dying in the Capitol to thousands of people

84
00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:49.960
dying in the Capitol.

85
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.970
<v 1>Well, in fairness to, to defend, uh, the people that cap,</v>

86
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.060
they didn't shoot the cop, they,

87
00:04:56.061 --> 00:04:59.970
they bludgeoned him to death with a fire extinguisher. Yes. So I do,

88
00:04:59.971 --> 00:05:04.710
I do want to just kind of put that out as a, as a defense of them. Listen,

89
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.370
I'm sure there was some wild going on on parlor. And I think the prompt,

90
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.540
here's the problem, right?

91
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.070
There's a lot of people that just want to go on these sites and say,

92
00:05:14.071 --> 00:05:18.180
they want to kill everyone. Yeah. And the problem is, you know,

93
00:05:18.181 --> 00:05:21.360
at what point do you shut them all down? Like,

94
00:05:21.361 --> 00:05:24.810
I think a lot of people are just living in a world where they're powerless.

95
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.010
They don't have any political power. They don't have any economic power. Right.

96
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.060
They can't throw their money around. Uh, they don't have health care, their,

97
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.550
their job security. Isn't great. Uh,

98
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.880
they might be living in a community that doesn't have the resources.

99
00:05:38.881 --> 00:05:43.290
They would like it to have. Uh, they're they're not happy and thrilled.

100
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.320
And then they have these sites where they can go on and just say, man,

101
00:05:46.321 --> 00:05:51.180
I'd like to burn it all down and distinguishing a guy

102
00:05:51.181 --> 00:05:56.130
blowing off steam and saying wild stuff from a genuine threat is a very

103
00:05:56.131 --> 00:06:00.650
hard thing to do. You know? Like I ha I've threatened to kill.

104
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.640
Uh, I got banned from Airbnb. I threatened to kill the people, um,

105
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.140
that bad B comedically, comedically,

106
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.260
this is a joke. I'm not going to kill you. This is a joke.

107
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.390
Cause I'm blowing off steam and I'm angry.

108
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.510
Do you know how many people that my parents, like, my dad's like,

109
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:18.860
I'm going to kill this guy.

110
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.670
<v 0>My mom's like, I'm going to kill. Yeah. And, and they were talking about.</v>

111
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.590
<v 1>But it's, but none of it ever happened, but we should be.</v>

112
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.660
I think you, you, you have to create a space for people to threaten,

113
00:06:31.661 --> 00:06:36.480
to overthrow the government. Yeah. As long as they don't violently do it. Like,

114
00:06:36.481 --> 00:06:38.470
I mean, does that make any sense? Like, I mean,

115
00:06:38.471 --> 00:06:40.840
as long as they're not going to go hurt innocent people,

116
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.380
what are you going to do? Like there's so many people out there that she's,

117
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.080
that's why a lot of these things like, you know, four Chan and the sides,

118
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.640
a lot of people going on there,

119
00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:53.620
they just want to say the most up because they it's the thing that it gives

120
00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:57.250
them, they can laugh or they can release steam. And it's, it is a mature,

121
00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.520
it is stupid. It's not productive. It's not, you know,

122
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:05.470
but at the end of the day, if you're not going to give people health insurance,

123
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.520
you got to give them something. It's like when someone in this country dies,

124
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.910
that everyone disagrees with, right? Political figure media figure,

125
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.210
a lot of people dance on their grave online. And then everyone,

126
00:07:16.211 --> 00:07:19.270
people goes dead and the other side will always do it.

127
00:07:19.271 --> 00:07:22.540
Like if a conservative dies and everyone goes, great. Conservatives goes to,

128
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:27.370
this is grotesque that you, and then when RBG dies, they all have parties.

129
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.650
And the conservatives go crate. Um,

130
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.390
you have to let people in this country enjoy the deaths of their enemies

131
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:41.170
because they don't have much else. Again, if you gave them other things,

132
00:07:41.171 --> 00:07:45.970
you might say, guy, you can go get any operation. Why don't you stop?

133
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:46.900
But if,

134
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:51.780
if they're working for wages and you haven't figured out a way to,

135
00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.750
to treat them, uh, treat their cancer diagnosis.

136
00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:00.730
And they don't like, I mean, life, you know, it, it, you know, you gotta have,

137
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.040
you got to derive pleasure from something.

138
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.990
<v 0>Yeah. It's an interesting point. That anger is a good valve like to,</v>

139
00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.720
for if your life is suffering,

140
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.440
that there's something very powerful about anger,

141
00:08:14.441 --> 00:08:18.610
but I still have hope that it doesn't have to be mean that kind of channeling

142
00:08:18.611 --> 00:08:21.790
into anger, uh, that then becomes hate.

143
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:27.130
Let us into a lot of troubles in human history. Yeah. You have to be careful,

144
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:33.220
uh, empowering people too much in that anger. Especially I think my,

145
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.440
I think I understand why people were nervous about parlor,

146
00:08:38.441 --> 00:08:40.150
about Twitter and so on. Yeah.

147
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:44.980
Because all that talking about violence was

148
00:08:44.981 --> 00:08:49.960
now paired with let's get together at this location that this was a

149
00:08:49.961 --> 00:08:50.800
new thing.

150
00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:55.000
Like it's not just being on whatever platform talking

151
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.280
it's saying we're going to in physical space meet.

152
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.160
And then everybody got all these platforms got nervous. Well,

153
00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:06.900
what happens when all these talkers, all these angry people that are just steam,

154
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.470
uh, letting off steam meet in a physical space. Uh,

155
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:14.760
and there was probably overreach, uh, almost definitely overreach,

156
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.020
but I can understand why they were.

157
00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.230
<v 1>I agree. There doesn't seem to be.</v>

158
00:09:18.231 --> 00:09:21.320
And this is when Trump got elected and when you have like, whatever you have,

159
00:09:21.321 --> 00:09:23.120
right? Whether you have riots in Portland and Seattle,

160
00:09:23.121 --> 00:09:26.480
where you have the Antifa people doing crazy things, you have like, you know,

161
00:09:26.481 --> 00:09:30.380
the people storming the Capitol. There never seems to be a ton of, uh,

162
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.070
an examination of why these ideas are becoming popular. Right?

163
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:38.900
Why are people so angry? What is leading people to this? Why are we here?

164
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:43.730
What about their lives is to the point where they need to show up at these

165
00:09:43.731 --> 00:09:45.440
places. And like, and obviously there's,

166
00:09:45.441 --> 00:09:48.200
there's going to be people on the fringe. They'll always be the mentally unwell.

167
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.660
They'll always be people that want to destroy society.

168
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:55.820
But when you look at how popular large, long discredited things,

169
00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:59.270
whether it's fascism, you know, totalitarian, communism,

170
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:04.280
all of these things are like, why are they back? Why are they back in a big way?

171
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:05.060
And why are,

172
00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:09.560
why are people so fed up with the status quo that they're finding,

173
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.090
you know, solace in the most extreme,

174
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:15.320
uh,

175
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:20.210
discredited theories of how to run and operate societies theories that have led

176
00:10:20.211 --> 00:10:22.070
to deaths. A lot of it. So to me, I'm like,

177
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.470
if those people at the Capitol, yes.

178
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.620
If they were going to work, if there's, you know,

179
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:33.770
if they were able to go out and drink at Chili's,

180
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:38.780
if they were able to get a checkup, right?

181
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:41.600
Like if their job paid a little bit better,

182
00:10:41.601 --> 00:10:43.770
and I'm not saying that this is all the reason, right?

183
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.880
I'm sure that there's a lot of people there that are doing quite well.

184
00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:47.893
And they're still nuts,

185
00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:52.460
but like the anger and the rage that's boiling to the surface of the

186
00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.313
society,

187
00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:58.160
does it come from the fact that across the board,

188
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:03.200
people in very different areas and with very different political beliefs,

189
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:08.270
feel like they are being over and there's nothing they can do about it.

190
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.810
That's what the baseline to me,

191
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:15.530
they look at the people that run the country and run the world.

192
00:11:15.531 --> 00:11:18.410
Whether they're tech Titans, the guys that you talked to,

193
00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:21.260
or whether they're people that run the government,

194
00:11:21.261 --> 00:11:25.610
whether they're people that run large banks, large media companies,

195
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.830
the people that have created this kind of infrastructure that everyone lives in,

196
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:35.510
these people are incredibly powerless. And when you push people to that point,

197
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.940
logically, sadly,

198
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:42.710
and unfortunately the next thing does seem to be violent.
