1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.860
<v 0>Can you speak a little bit more to the connection between aliens</v>

2
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.250
and technology that, uh,

3
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.970
Jack valet had in his own one individual mind,

4
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.890
that's very tempting to kind of separate as two separate

5
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.593
endeavors.

6
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.640
Why did you come to believe that they're one in the same

7
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.830
or at least part of the same, uh,

8
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.300
intellectual journey.

9
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.510
<v 1>Thanks for asking that again,</v>

10
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.160
because nobody asks me that question and it's

11
00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:42.230
central to my project.

12
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.790
So jock was a huge influence is a huge influence on me.

13
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.960
Um, he taught me a lot. Um, I had,

14
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.640
he gave me access to some of his information that's, um,

15
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.570
that he keeps, um, but a lot of his information is actually there,

16
00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:04.340
out there for everyone to read. Um, he has an academia.edu page and he just,

17
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.920
so he didn't have this, unfortunately,

18
00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:10.520
when I was doing my research in 2012 and 2013,

19
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.520
so I had to go back and do microfish type stuff. You know,

20
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.060
what I did was I began to read everything that he wrote and he actually gave me

21
00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:20.150
a lot of his books too. And he told me you, I remember, um,

22
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.440
he dropped me off from,

23
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.190
this is actually quite interesting if you'll allow me to tell you a little

24
00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:29.360
story. Okay. And it also includes Iowasca so,

25
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.400
Okay. So I was at a conference in, uh, mid, it was a small conference,

26
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.511
um, uh,

27
00:01:38.511 --> 00:01:42.440
very interesting people in California on the Pacific ocean and Jacques was

28
00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:46.280
there. And, um, this is actually I opened my book. This is the book,

29
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.260
this is the I go, I see the preface to my book. I go on this ride.

30
00:01:51.261 --> 00:01:54.740
He takes me through Silicon Valley. I've lived there, right.

31
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.700
My grandparents grew up in the same place that he raised his children in

32
00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:02.330
Belmont. And so, um, but we were there, Robbie Graham,

33
00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:06.380
who's a great Eufaula just in his own. Right. And, um,

34
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.880
and film theorist. I highly recommend his work. Um,

35
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.660
so we were together and he was taking us to San Francisco where I was going to

36
00:02:14.661 --> 00:02:16.790
meet my brother. Who's going to take me home.

37
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.740
And so he took us on this long journey and he talked to us and as we got out of

38
00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:23.510
the car, um,

39
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.430
he gave me several of his books and one in particular, he gave me, he said,

40
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.380
read this first. I was like, okay. I definitely will read that first.

41
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.520
Okay. So this is how the Iowasca figures in. So, um, we were,

42
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.200
I didn't take it nor have I taken it. Okay. So we're at this place and,

43
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.250
um,

44
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.450
in California and Alex Gray and his wife were there and they were talking about,

45
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.210
um, their experiences with psychedelics, you know,

46
00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:53.560
he's an amazing visionary artist. Okay. So he,

47
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.660
he believes that there's a place that you can enter.

48
00:02:56.661 --> 00:03:00.520
And he and his wife would enter this space with either, you know,

49
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:04.900
Iowasca or LSD or something like that. And they would not talk to each other,

50
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:08.650
but they would be having the same exact experience. So they would,

51
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.250
it was almost like having the same dream. Right. Okay. So,

52
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.670
so somehow that whole event with Jacques,

53
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.790
their TA and them talking about their experiences in these realms of which

54
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:24.070
religious studies people are quite familiar by the way,

55
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:26.830
because visionary experiences are what we study.

56
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.960
So all of this seems super familiar to me, and I recognize that immediately,

57
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:36.460
that shock that it hit me, like,

58
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.180
you know,

59
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.100
very obvious that UFO's and these experiences and

60
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:46.780
technology all seemed, they were all meshed together.

61
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.730
And I knew that I had to take them.

62
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.800
I knew I had to read everything shock ever wrote,

63
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:53.530
and the best stuff he's written by the way is the stuff,

64
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.410
his little essays that he wrote in the 1970s.

65
00:03:56.411 --> 00:04:00.700
And they were peer reviewed essays about the beginning of the internet and how a

66
00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:04.870
lot of it was based on, um, basically like,

67
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.260
um, neural connection with the internet,

68
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.130
like somehow psychic connection through the internet with others and things like

69
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:12.964
that.

70
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.810
<v 0>The brain is a biological neural network. There's, uh,</v>

71
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.060
this connection between division neurons and so on.

72
00:04:18.061 --> 00:04:21.330
And that's what ultimately is able to have, uh,

73
00:04:21.331 --> 00:04:24.840
memories and has cognitive ability and is able to, uh,

74
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.720
perceive the world and generate ideas.

75
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.700
And those ideas are then spread on the internet even from the very early

76
00:04:32.701 --> 00:04:33.840
days to other humans.

77
00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:38.010
So it gets injected or travels into the brains of other humans.

78
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.760
And it goes around in there and then spits out all this stuff and it goes back

79
00:04:41.761 --> 00:04:45.960
and forth. So it's, it's nice to think of a network that's in our mind,

80
00:04:45.961 --> 00:04:48.990
individual mind, as, I mean,

81
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.950
I'm very much even deeply connected to the network.

82
00:04:52.951 --> 00:04:56.190
That is the connection between humans through the internet.

83
00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.840
And so in that sense, jock saw the internet as this,

84
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.330
as this powerful, um,

85
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.770
as a source of power and wisdom that is beyond our own.

86
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.860
<v 1>Definitely that's external to us, like a non, like, you know,</v>

87
00:05:10.861 --> 00:05:13.350
if you could call it atonomous AI, right.

88
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.370
<v 0>It's non-human intelligence in the sense, even though humans are a part of it.</v>

89
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.790
<v 1>Or we're invaded by it, or, you know, whatever you want to call it.</v>

90
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.360
<v 0>Yeah. Right. It's the chicken and egg, right.</v>

91
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.940
<v 1>If I can go on, I don't want to experience, I'm not done with that. Yeah.</v>

92
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.140
So, and this is, so this is where I come to this idea that,

93
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.780
um, we're in this space, we're in now a new space of religion of religiosity.

94
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.370
So what happens is then I,

95
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.460
and it's like a biosphere and I'll talk about that in a minute. So we, so,

96
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.890
so jock takes us back. We get to San Francisco and my brother,

97
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.960
who is your straight lace person, army guy, and everything like that.

98
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.690
Um, I get into his car and the first thing he tells is I took Iowasca and I was

99
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.870
talking and he goes, it's going to save humanity.

100
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.380
<v 0>That's great. Yeah. As I mentioned to you offline,</v>

101
00:06:08.381 --> 00:06:11.350
I talked to Matthew Johnson is a Hopkins professor on a,

102
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.940
he's a really a scholar of most he's he's.

103
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.530
He started most drugs cause he's also really deeply studied cocaine and all

104
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.450
those stuff on negative effects. And, uh,

105
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.110
he's focused on a lot of positive effects of the different psychedelics.

106
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.280
It's kind of fascinating.

107
00:06:27.281 --> 00:06:31.960
So I'm very much interested in exploring

108
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.110
the science of what these things do to the, to the human mind.

109
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.010
And also personally exploring it, although it's like this weird gray area,

110
00:06:42.011 --> 00:06:44.560
which he he's he's masterful at,

111
00:06:44.561 --> 00:06:47.740
which is he's a professor at John Hopkins,

112
00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:50.200
one of the most prestigious universities in the world and,

113
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:55.510
and doing large-scale studies of this stuff. And it, until,

114
00:06:55.511 --> 00:06:59.680
until he got a lot of money for these studies, even in, uh,

115
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.360
Hopkins itself, there's not much risk, not even respect. It was like,

116
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.930
uh, people just didn't want to talk about it. Uh, as a,

117
00:07:07.931 --> 00:07:09.850
as a legitimate field of inquiry,

118
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.990
it's kind of fascinating how hesitant we are as a little

119
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.930
human civilization to, um,

120
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.670
legitimize the exploration of the mysterious of whatever the

121
00:07:21.671 --> 00:07:24.970
definition of the mysterious is for that particular period of time.

122
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.420
So for us now there's like little groups of things.

123
00:07:28.421 --> 00:07:32.830
Like I would say consciousness in the space of like computer science

124
00:07:32.831 --> 00:07:36.370
research is something that's still like, Hmm. I don't know.

125
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.400
Maybe it was philosophers kicking around for a little longer.

126
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.360
And then the certainly extraterrestrial life forms

127
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.000
from, um,

128
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:51.370
in most formulations of that problem space, uh,

129
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.330
is still the other, it's still the source of the mysterious,

130
00:07:55.331 --> 00:07:58.210
except maybe like SETI, which is like,

131
00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:02.890
how can we detect signals from far away alien intelligence is that we'll be able

132
00:08:02.891 --> 00:08:06.580
to, uh, perceive yeah, it's a,

133
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.870
and psychedelics is another one of those that's like, we're starting to see.

134
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:12.520
Okay. Well, can we, um,

135
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.650
try to see if there's some medical applications of like helping you get,

136
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:22.150
uh, like he does studies of helping you quit smoking or help you in some kind of

137
00:08:22.151 --> 00:08:26.110
treatment of some disease. And he's sneaking into that. I mean,

138
00:08:26.111 --> 00:08:30.040
it's like openly sneaking into it, some studies on it of like,

139
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:35.710
how can you expand the mind with these tools and what can the

140
00:08:35.711 --> 00:08:38.740
mind discover through psychedelics and so on?

141
00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:43.210
And we're like slowly creeping into the space of being able to explore these

142
00:08:43.211 --> 00:08:45.190
mysterious questions, but it's like,

143
00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:49.810
it sucks that sometimes a lot of people have to die, meaning,

144
00:08:49.811 --> 00:08:52.810
sorry. Uh, they have to age out

145
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.690
like it's like faculty have a,

146
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.890
and people have a fixed set of ideas and they stick by them.

147
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.440
And in order for new ideas to come in,

148
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.660
then the young folks have to be born with the PA with an open

149
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:11.280
mind and the possibility of those ideas.

150
00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:15.300
And then they have to become old enough and get A's in school and whatever to,

151
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.190
to, uh, to then carry those ideas forward. So, you know, the acceptance of the,

152
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.330
uh, exploration of the mysterious takes time. It's kinda sad.
