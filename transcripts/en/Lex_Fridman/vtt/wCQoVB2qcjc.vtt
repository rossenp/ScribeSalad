00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.640
<v 0>I mean, the Toban, you know, used to shoot televisions. They used to, you know,</v>

2
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.320
blow up, uh, VCR, um, you know, videotapes. Um,

3
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.880
they used to string audio and videocassette from trees and kind of

4
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.920
ceremonial hangings, right. That were,

5
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.230
we're killing this nefarious in infantile technology that is doing the work of

6
00:00:24.231 --> 00:00:27.230
Satan. And yet today in PLA I mean,

7
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.350
one of the keys to the top on success is that they got really good at using

8
00:00:30.351 --> 00:00:31.184
media.

9
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.630
<v 1>I mean, brilliant at using, uh, written word, the spoken word music, actually.</v>

10
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.550
Um, and you know, Hollywood,

11
00:00:39.551 --> 00:00:44.140
Hollywood is the gold standard and these guys have studied. You create drama,

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.220
how to speak to modern users. I mean, Islamic state did this. I mean the,

13
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.620
the role of media, new media, I mean,

14
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.820
I am I follow and I am followed by senior Toban leaders, which is,

15
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.820
you know, bizarre, you know, on Twitter, on they, on Twitter.

16
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.980
<v 0>I don't know why they care about me. I am. I'm nothing. Uh, they, they follow,</v>

17
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.530
they follow you on Twitter. I don't know why this is no joke. This is no joke.

18
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.490
So it's, they're part of our modern world. It's how they talk.

19
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.890
And it's how they recruit. And this is part of the, this is why they are,

20
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.730
you know, so, so Ben Laden, if you bin Laden, he, he speaks multiple languages.

21
00:01:16.731 --> 00:01:21.130
I would say it's, uh, it's environmentalism. You know,

22
00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:23.450
the west is bad because we destroyed the planet.

23
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.680
The west is bad because we abuse women. So in, in class, you know,

24
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.081
uh, especially, you know,

25
00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:33.840
female students are very surprised to learn and actually say, you know, this,

26
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.720
this feminist argument is not, you know, we start with,

27
00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:41.800
you know, this is a murder. This is a person who has taken human life,

28
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.310
innocent life over and over again. And he is a, um, you know,

29
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.110
aspirationally genocidal, but let's try to understand what he's about.

30
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.870
So we walk through the texts, read them,

31
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.310
and people are shocked to learn that it's not just about,

32
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.030
you know, quotations in Theran strung together in some irrational fashion.

33
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.670
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; he knows. Um, I mean, at the core,

34
00:02:03.671 --> 00:02:07.380
I'd say is the problem of human suffering. And he has a geography of that.

35
00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:10.620
That is mostly Muslim, but he talks about the suffering of cashmere, right.

36
00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:11.660
So if you have a student in your class,

37
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.980
who's from south Asia who knows about Kashmere, you know, he, or she will say,

38
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.220
that's not entirely inaccurate, you know? Yeah.
