00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.010
<v 0>What is a good diet for strength development. I've uh,</v>

2
00:00:06.011 --> 00:00:10.410
just to give you some context, I've been eating mostly meat, not for strength,

3
00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:12.410
mostly for mental performance. I just.

4
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.010
<v 1>Enjoy it. Yes.</v>

5
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.970
You need to have a base level of protein building blocks for tissue, right?

6
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.280
We need to have enough fats to be able to have hormones work and key

7
00:00:24.281 --> 00:00:27.280
processes in the body we need to have, well,

8
00:00:27.281 --> 00:00:30.400
you don't need to have from a performance aspect carbohydrates necessarily

9
00:00:30.401 --> 00:00:32.480
because the other ones can convert into injury sources,

10
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.600
but for a performance athlete, Cobra, hydrates can be very beneficial, uh,

11
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.240
as well. So, um, so I look at it as you want,

12
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.430
you need a base level fat, you need a base level of proteins,

13
00:00:45.431 --> 00:00:48.790
and then you adjust the carbohydrate intake based on the needs.

14
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.990
I'm not anti carbohydrate by any means. Um, cuz a lot of people,

15
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.430
well they look at me now when they see like how lean I am and they,

16
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.390
they jump to a conclusion, you must be keto, you must be carnivore.

17
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.390
You must be whatever. And it's like,

18
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.220
so losing and gaining weight is simply eating less or eating more

19
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.900
&lt;laugh&gt; I mean it, uh, and we get so complicated.

20
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.660
Oh that my FA like what's your fasting window. If I'm,

21
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.580
if I'm doing fasting, it's just because it works with my, my environment.

22
00:01:19.581 --> 00:01:20.660
Sometimes I do it sometimes.

23
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.380
I don't mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; all that does is control how much calories that

24
00:01:24.381 --> 00:01:28.490
you, you take big success with keto and carnivore diets. It's hard to eat a lot,

25
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.290
uh, and, and put on weight with those, with those diets.

26
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.090
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um, you know, protein actually has a thermogenic effect.

27
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.850
And so you have to have a massive amount of fats. If you have a only meat diet,

28
00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:44.810
because you can literally starve to death. There's a, there's a, a,

29
00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:47.280
a show where they put people out in the wilderness and this guy,

30
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.640
the one that won one of the ones I looked on, they threw him way,

31
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.720
like up in the, uh, a past LA you know, out the way out there,

32
00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:56.200
there was nothing, but he somehow got a caribou and killed it.

33
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.280
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and he still lost a pound a day for 30 days with a caribou

34
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.280
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; because his fat was stolen by a, uh, uh, and,

35
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.190
and he could eat all the meat he wanted and they almost got pulled because his

36
00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:11.710
weight loss. Right. Um, but that isn't actually a performance.

37
00:02:11.711 --> 00:02:14.550
So those type keto and carnivore are not performance diets.

38
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.390
So they're not gonna be as effective at supplying, uh,

39
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.310
the energy needs for high capacity training. So don't get me wrong.

40
00:02:23.311 --> 00:02:27.300
You can do training, but like, you can be a successful, like a,

41
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.060
a athlete with a, with a vegan diet,

42
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.900
but it's not as easy to do it with other diets. So,

43
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.620
and you're missing some base nutrients. So many nutrients in meat, I believe,

44
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.500
uh, having greens in your diet is really beneficial, lots of research,

45
00:02:44.501 --> 00:02:47.530
but there's people in the other worlds that argue that they don't need them,

46
00:02:47.531 --> 00:02:51.650
but they help clear organs provide micronutrients, all this sort of stuff.

47
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.930
So I eat simply a whole well rounded diet, and I've gone from,

48
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.050
I can go from 285 pounds,

49
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.320
squatting a ton of weight to eating less and dropping all the way down to,

50
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.081
you know, seven,

51
00:03:04.081 --> 00:03:08.440
8% body fat with vein standing out everywhere without a tissue on me,

52
00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:11.000
just with amazing great tasting food.

53
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.240
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; to lose weight or be healthy,

54
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.760
does not mean that you need to eat flavorless bland food.

55
00:03:16.761 --> 00:03:19.830
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so that's the main thing. Try to.

56
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.750
<v 0>Get across. It's eat less to lose weight, eat more to gain weight.</v>

57
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.710
<v 1>Yep. Make sure that you've got enough protein.</v>

58
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.910
Make sure that you've got your micronutrients covered,

59
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:32.230
which is gonna cover by eating real food. Don't go low fat, no fat.

60
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.070
If you want a performance, don't go no carb, but if it works,

61
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.710
any of those things, so diet approach, when you look at diets,

62
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.340
understand that they're how aggressive they are.

63
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.540
So like keto can make you lose a lot of weight.

64
00:03:45.541 --> 00:03:47.420
Carnivore can make you lose a lot of weight. Um,

65
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.060
a lot of that upfront is actually Glock dropping glycogen stores.

66
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.741
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; uh,

67
00:03:51.741 --> 00:03:54.860
so you're actually just reducing water in your muscle and fat tissue. Um,

68
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.020
so which is why it doesn't isn't as great for a performance diet,

69
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.050
but understand that every diet also has a level of

70
00:04:03.051 --> 00:04:05.530
discipline. And does it fit your lifestyle?

71
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.610
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so I suggest people don't find a diet.

72
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.850
You need to find a lifestyle because that's, what's sustainable.

73
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.410
I hate the word diet to begin with mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; what behaviors

74
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.640
are sustainable. And then do that. And then over time,

75
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.240
the things you'll get to where you need to get mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; diet itself

76
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.440
just by the name of it is not sustainable because it,

77
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.720
it is a short term thing to get somewhere.

78
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.640
<v 0>Yeah. I tend to try to measure it cause I definitely have a love,</v>

79
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.870
heat relationship with food. I tend to look back and say like,

80
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.270
by following this particular protocol, lifestyle, whatever, uh,

81
00:04:47.271 --> 00:04:49.990
what was the level of happiness &lt;laugh&gt; yes.

82
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.750
So not like weight loss or weight gain or all those kinds of things.

83
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.270
It's the entirety of the picture productivity just feeling good throughout the

84
00:04:58.271 --> 00:05:03.060
day. Socially also like, yeah. Acting with people because so much of, uh,

85
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.420
human connection, like I mentioned before is over food.

86
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.580
And if you're gonna limit yourself in that regard, you're,

87
00:05:09.581 --> 00:05:11.860
you're limiting a certain fundamental aspect of life.

88
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.300
<v 1>Uh, number of years ago, um, I did, uh,</v>

89
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.580
like 20 to 22 hour fast every day mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and I'm like, well,

90
00:05:19.581 --> 00:05:22.530
this doesn't work I'm I can't do business loan inches and stuff like that.

91
00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:24.610
So when I was in my fasting thing, I went to a 16,

92
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:27.930
so I could have a light lunch mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; just for the social aspect of

93
00:05:27.931 --> 00:05:30.530
it and perform able to perform that. That's funny. &lt;laugh&gt; um,

94
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.650
and then that's why, and that's why like the typical body building,

95
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.010
like the eight meal a day diet mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, um,

96
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.690
has never worked for me because I've always been a very B like trying to fit

97
00:05:39.691 --> 00:05:43.800
that between meetings and other stuff. Um, what that diet provides is it just,

98
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.320
you get less bloat in distinction of a larger meal, but at the end of the day,

99
00:05:48.321 --> 00:05:49.640
you get the same exact results,

100
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.560
pick a lifestyle live that you can have really great tasting food.

101
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.440
And that to me is the sta and this is why I'm like really hitting this point

102
00:05:59.441 --> 00:06:03.840
because also with the dieting and like the approach like, oh, I'm gonna do this.

103
00:06:03.841 --> 00:06:07.680
And people pick these chicken and broccoli recipes,

104
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.360
and guess what you're going to break. If you do not in, if you do not enjoy it,

105
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.750
you will break mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. So it's,

106
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.190
it is a very important point.

107
00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:20.693
<v 0>Well,</v>

108
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.910
I also slightly push back or maybe to elaborate if you

109
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:30.670
don't enjoy moderation for me particularly, um,

110
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.510
I have trouble moderating certain things, most foods I would say.

111
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.420
So my source of happines comes with foods,

112
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.940
even if they're bland or the ones that can enjoy, but enjoy moderation.

113
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.900
So there's, I mean, I enjoy every piece of food, so it's like, it's, uh,

114
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.020
if you can enjoy the, the full lifestyle,

115
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.780
it's not just the particular experience, but like mm-hmm,

116
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:54.220
&lt;affirmative&gt; the full.

117
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.770
<v 1>Journey. Yep. Does it fit your lifestyle? Yeah. Yep. It.</v>
