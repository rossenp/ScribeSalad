1
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.630
<v 0>What is the greatest song of all time? Oh, objectively speaking.</v>

2
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.390
<v 1>The greatest song of all time.</v>

3
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.670
<v 0>I, I suppose that could change moment to moment, day to day.</v>

4
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.790
But if you were forced to answer for this particular moment in your life,

5
00:00:15.791 --> 00:00:19.630
that's something that pops to mind. This could be both philosophically.

6
00:00:19.631 --> 00:00:22.830
This could be technically as a musician. Like, will you enjoy maybe lyric?

7
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.620
Like for me, mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, it's lyrics is very important.

8
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.860
So absolutely I would probably would be, uh, my choice would be lyrics.

9
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.500
<v 1>Based. I don't want to answer in terms of just technical, uh, you know,</v>

10
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.620
technical prowes I think technical prowes is impressive.

11
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.580
Right? It's just like, it's impressive. What can be done?

12
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.250
I wouldn't place that into the category of the greatest music ever written some

13
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.490
classical music. Uh,

14
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.010
that's that's written is undeniably beautiful,

15
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:57.410
but I don't want to consider that category of music either.

16
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.330
Uh, just because, you know, so if I, if I to limit, uh,

17
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.640
the scope of philosophical discussion, uh, to,

18
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.280
you know, the kind music that I listen to, you know,

19
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.160
probably what's my age again, by blink 180 2, it's just, you know,

20
00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:18.560
it's a solid one. It's got, you know, &lt;laugh&gt;.

21
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.560
<v 0>Said nobody ever that's a good song. Its I don't know if you're.</v>

22
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.590
<v 1>Joking. No, no, I am. I am joking. It's a good one. But it's was yeah.</v>

23
00:01:27.591 --> 00:01:28.430
I mean think.

24
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:29.703
<v 0>Back is a close second.</v>

25
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.263
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

26
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.870
<v 0>What's my age you get, oh.</v>

27
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.070
<v 1>Yeah, no, I mean it would probably, you know, songwriting wise,</v>

28
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.710
I think the Beatles came pretty close to.

29
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.700
<v 0>Were they influential to you? Like the Beatles? Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.620
<v 1>Love the Beatles. I love the Beatles.</v>

31
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.260
<v 0>Uh, would it be yesterday?</v>

32
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.380
<v 1>Yeah, like straw, I think strawberry feels forever is, is one, you know, what,</v>

33
00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.340
what, one of my favorite beetles songs is it's uh, you know, in my life,

34
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.020
right. That song it's, it's hard to imagine how whatever,

35
00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:09.010
a 24 year old yeah. Who wrote that it is one of the most, uh,

36
00:02:09.011 --> 00:02:12.290
introspective pieces of music ever, you know,

37
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.010
I'm a huge pink Floyd fan. And so I think, you know, if you were to,

38
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.690
you can sort of look at the entire dark side of the moon album and as,

39
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.903
you know,

40
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.880
getting pretty close up there to the pinnacle of what you know can be created.

41
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.760
So, you know, time's a great song. Yeah. It's a great.

42
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.640
<v 0>Song. There's just the entirety of just the instruments, the lyrics,</v>

43
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.680
the, the, the, the feeling created by a song like pink Floyd

44
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.760
can create feelings, the entire experience. I mean,

45
00:02:45.761 --> 00:02:48.790
you have that with the wall of just, uh,

46
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.710
transporting you into another place songs.

47
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.070
Don't not many songs could do that as, as well.

48
00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.950
Not many artists can do that as well as pink Floyd did.

49
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.160
<v 1>There are a lot of bands that you can kind of say, oh yeah,</v>

50
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.560
like if you take blink 180 2, right. If you have no idea,

51
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.720
like if you are listening to sort of that type of pop punk for the first time,

52
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.880
it's difficult to differentiate between blink 180 2 and like some 41.

53
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.870
And the thousand of other are like lesser known.

54
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.830
<v 0>Bands that all sounded, they all had that sparkling production, uh,</v>

55
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.670
feel, they all kind of sounded the same. Yeah. Uh, right. When it,

56
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.470
with pink Floyd, it's hard to find another band that you're like, well,

57
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.590
is this one pink Floyd? Or like, you know yeah.

58
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.740
When you're listening to what you were listening to,

59
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.740
that the uniqueness that that's fascinating, you know,

60
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.460
in the calculation of the greatest song in the greatest band of all time,

61
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.273
you could probably,

62
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.460
you could probably actually quantify this like scientifically mm-hmm

63
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.820
&lt;affirmative&gt; is like how unique, uh, if you play a different songs,

64
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.930
how well are people able to re eyes, whether it's this band or not, and that,

65
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.970
you know, that's probably a huge component to greatness.

66
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.770
Like if the world would miss it, if it was gone. Yes.

67
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.770
<v 1>Yes. So.</v>

68
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.450
<v 0>But there's also the human story. Things like I would say,</v>

69
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.850
I output Johnny Cass's cover of hurt mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; as one of the greatest

70
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.760
songs of all time. And that has less to do with the song.

71
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.960
<v 1>But your interaction with it.</v>

72
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.960
<v 0>Interaction with it, but also the human,</v>

73
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.920
the full story of the human mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. So like, it's not just,

74
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.640
if I just heard the song, it'd be like, okay, that,

75
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.040
but if it it's the full story of it also the video component for that particular

76
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.510
song. So like that you can't discount the full experience of.

77
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.310
<v 1>It. Absolutely. You know, I have no confusion about not about being,</v>

78
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.430
you know, anywhere, uh, you know, in, in that lean.

79
00:04:51.431 --> 00:04:55.710
But I just like, uh, sometimes think about, you know, music that is being,

80
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.580
uh, produced today feels oftentimes like,

81
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.933
like kind of clothes,

82
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.100
like clothes that you buy at like H and M and you wear three

83
00:05:08.101 --> 00:05:11.340
times before they rip and you throw away. So like,

84
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.220
so much of it is it's not bad, it's just kind of forgettable, right?

85
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.040
Like the,

86
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.850
the fact that we're talking about pink Floyd in 2021 is

87
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.610
in itself an interesting, uh, question, why are we talking about pink Floyd?

88
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.170
And it's, there's something unforgettable about them.

89
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.330
And unforgetable about the, the art that they.

90
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.850
<v 0>Created. That could be the markets that like,</v>

91
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.450
so Spotify's created this kind of market where the,

92
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.360
the incentives for creating music that lasts as much lower,

93
00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:44.280
because there's so much more music, right?

94
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.720
You just want something that shines bright for a short amount of time makes a

95
00:05:48.721 --> 00:05:50.240
lot of money and moves on. And the,

96
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.840
I mean the same thing you see with the news and all those kinds of things,

97
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.800
we're just living in a shorter and shorter, shorter, like, uh,

98
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.600
timescale in terms of our attention spans. And that, um, nevertheless,

99
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:04.600
when we look at the long arc of history of music,

100
00:06:04.601 --> 00:06:09.560
perhaps there will be some songs from today that will last as much as pink Floyd

101
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.240
were just unable to see it. Yeah. Just a collected works of Nickelback.

102
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.390
&lt;laugh&gt; exactly. You, you never know, you know, Justin Bieber it could have,

103
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:19.710
oh yeah. It could be a competitor.

104
00:06:19.711 --> 00:06:22.150
I've recently started listening to Justin Bieber just to understand what people

105
00:06:22.151 --> 00:06:23.510
are talking about. And, you know,

106
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.390
I'll just keep my comments to myself on that one. It's too good to explain it.

107
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.710
The words not capture the greatness. That is the BES.
