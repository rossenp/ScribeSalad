1
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.740
<v 0>You know what let's go to dusty. Yeski.</v>

2
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:05.740
<v 1>All right. Okay.</v>

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.620
<v 0>Let's do it. So my favorite novel of his is, uh, the idiot. First of all,</v>

4
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.060
I see myself as the idiot and an idiot, and I,

5
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.940
I love the optimism and the love, the main character has for the world.

6
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.690
So that just deeply connects with me as a novel, uh, uh,

7
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.210
notes from underground as well.

8
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.450
But what ideas of doki do you think are

9
00:00:31.451 --> 00:00:35.370
existentialists? What ideas are formative to the whole existentialist movement?

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.010
<v 1>Excellent. So let me talk about the brothers, Karen mosso. Yes.</v>

11
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.370
Partly because that's the last novel that doki wrote.

12
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.360
I think it's certainly of the greatest novels of the 19th century, uh,

13
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.080
may be the best and I'm about to teach it in a few weeks.

14
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.960
So I'm super excited about it, but what is,

15
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:55.680
what is the brother's Kara mosso about? I mean, without, you know,

16
00:00:55.681 --> 00:01:00.200
without spoiling the ending for anyone spoiler alert. Yeah. I mean, look, it's,

17
00:01:00.201 --> 00:01:05.150
it's a murder mystery, right? I mean, the father gets murdered. Yeah.

18
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.070
And the question is who did it? Who's responsible for it. So there's,

19
00:01:09.071 --> 00:01:11.230
there's a notion of responsibility here, like art,

20
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.590
but it's responsibility for a murder. That's what we're talking about.

21
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.390
And there's a bunch of brothers,

22
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.950
each of a whom &lt;laugh&gt; has pretty good motivation for having

23
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.540
more murdered the father. The father's a jerk. I mean, he's, you know,

24
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.100
if anybody is worthy of being murdered, he's the guy he's, he's,

25
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.220
he's a force of chaos and he's nasty in all sorts of ways,

26
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.900
but still it's not, not good to murder people. &lt;laugh&gt; so, so what's the,

27
00:01:43.901 --> 00:01:45.690
what's the view of dusts. I mean,

28
00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:50.650
it's this intense exploration of what it means to be involved

29
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.770
in various ways with an activity that everyone can

30
00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:57.210
recognize as atrocious

31
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.610
and what the right way is to take responsibility for that,

32
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.400
what the right way to relate to others in the face of it and

33
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.200
how even through this kind of action,

34
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.640
you can achieve some kind of salvation. That's, dosy S's word for it.

35
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.881
You can li and,

36
00:02:18.881 --> 00:02:23.560
but salvation here and now not like you live some afterlife

37
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.000
where you're, you know, paradise for eternal,

38
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.670
who cares about that says one of the characters that doesn't make my life

39
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:32.690
now any good,

40
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.310
and it doesn't justify any of the bad things that happen in my life. Now,

41
00:02:36.311 --> 00:02:41.270
what matters is can we live well in the face of these things that

42
00:02:41.271 --> 00:02:42.870
we do and have to take responsibility for?

43
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:47.780
So it's this intense exploration of notions and

44
00:02:47.781 --> 00:02:52.500
gradations of guilt and responsibility and the possibility of

45
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.060
love and salvation in the face of those.

46
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.860
It is incredibly human work and here,

47
00:02:58.861 --> 00:03:02.920
but I think doki is the opposite of SART mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. And let me just,

48
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.920
I think it's so fascinating. I don't know anybody else who notices this,

49
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.560
but SART in SART actually quotes a passage from Dostoevsky when he's

50
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:14.840
developing his view, mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; is close to a passage.

51
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.350
It doesn't appear quite in this way, but the passage that SART quote is,

52
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.150
is this is, is in the form of an argument.

53
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.070
SAR puts it in the form of an argument. He says, um, look, there's a,

54
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.870
a conditional statement is true. If there is no, God,

55
00:03:29.871 --> 00:03:34.070
then everything is permitted mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then there's a second

56
00:03:34.071 --> 00:03:38.950
premise. There is no God that's start's view. I mean, he's an atheist.

57
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.060
There is no God conclusion.

58
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.540
Everything is permitted &lt;laugh&gt; and that starts radical freedom.

59
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.100
And if you think about the structure of the brothers Karas off,

60
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.020
I think DSKY though, he never says it this way would run.

61
00:03:54.021 --> 00:03:58.100
The argument differently is a Motus tollens instead of a Motus bons,

62
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.170
the argument for, for, to AKI would go like this. Yeah. Conditional statement.

63
00:04:03.171 --> 00:04:07.210
If there is no, God, then everything is permitted. But look at your life,

64
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.010
not everything is permitted.

65
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.530
&lt;laugh&gt; you do horrible atrocious things like be involved in the

66
00:04:15.531 --> 00:04:17.970
death of your father. And there is a price to pay.

67
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.040
That's not a livable moment you to take,

68
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.720
to have to take responsibility,

69
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.640
to have to recognize that you are at fault,

70
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.000
or you are somehow guilty for having been involved in whatever way you were in

71
00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:36.960
letting that happen or bringing it up that it does happen is to pay a price.

72
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.510
So we're not beings that are constituted such a way that everything

73
00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:45.350
is permitted. Look at the facts of your existence.

74
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.590
So not everything is permitted.

75
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.430
Therefore there is a God &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt; that's and,

76
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.670
and, and the, and the, and the presence of a God for dusty, I think,

77
00:04:56.671 --> 00:05:00.390
is just found in this fact that when we do bad things,

78
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.660
we feel guilty for them that we find ourselves to be responsible for things,

79
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.820
even when we didn't intend to do them,

80
00:05:06.821 --> 00:05:09.340
but we just allowed ourselves to be involved in them. And.

81
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.740
<v 0>The nature of God for just Eski is, I mean, unclear. I mean,</v>

82
00:05:13.741 --> 00:05:17.540
it's a very complex exploration in itself, and he basically,

83
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.930
God speaks through several of his characters in, in complicated ways. Yeah.

84
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.410
So it's not like a trivial UHS version.

85
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.330
<v 1>Of God. It's totally not trivial. And it's not a,</v>

86
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.410
a being that exists outside of time and right.

87
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.250
None of that is sort of relevant for dusty Ky for him.

88
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.130
It's a question about how we live our lives.

89
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.290
Do we live our lives in the mood that Christianity says it makes available to

90
00:05:39.291 --> 00:05:40.250
us, which is the mood of joy.
