00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.720
<v 0>This is the [inaudible] new year and new year's Eve.</v>

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.233
Uh,

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.040
so you talked about succession and the world burning down and

4
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.060
you holding the match at the end. Yes.

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.840
They ending with a big smile on your face. Yes. Why so serious,

6
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.053
but, uh,

7
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.680
let me ask you if it doesn't include flame and succession and

8
00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:33.480
destruction and laughing malice in makeup, in a white suit at the end,

9
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.420
uh, how do we bring more kindness and love to the world in 2021,

10
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.210
easy be comfortable saying I want to be

11
00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:45.044
happy.

12
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.520
And if there's someone who interjects and gives you attitude,

13
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.020
arms length them,

14
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.780
surround yourself with people who also want to be happy. Here's a great example.

15
00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.910
My buddy, Chris Williamson, who I've mentioned before,

16
00:00:58.911 --> 00:01:03.230
he's a podcast or does modern wisdom if he's, he's an awesome dude.

17
00:01:03.231 --> 00:01:05.630
And we became friends, very close friends this past year.

18
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.830
And he was in Dubai recently and he sent me pictures from Dubai, by the pool,

19
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:10.790
just loving life.

20
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.770
And it took me a week and then it clicked in my head and I'm like,

21
00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:19.310
you know what? For some other people,

22
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.570
if they saw him under remodel at the pool,

23
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.240
they would think this is him bragging or humbled bragging.

24
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.850
And that never entered my head. I'm like, Oh man,

25
00:01:28.851 --> 00:01:33.590
I'm so glad my boy can be having a good time and is sharing

26
00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:38.030
his joy with me. That's the kind of people you need to surround yourself with,

27
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.130
where it never enters their head to be resentful or anything other than

28
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.960
sharing in your bounty. What makes you happy?

29
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.840
I'm happy all the time. And one of the points I made in my life is like,

30
00:01:53.841 --> 00:01:54.674
I really hate it.

31
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.820
I really did not like to give advice because I feel don't give advice until you

32
00:01:58.821 --> 00:02:01.130
know what you're talking about. And to me,

33
00:02:01.131 --> 00:02:03.260
what makes me happy is being self-actualized.

34
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.330
I am in a position with my career where I could be myself 24

35
00:02:08.331 --> 00:02:09.164
seven,

36
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.550
where I never have to engage in small talk where I never have to interact with

37
00:02:13.551 --> 00:02:14.600
someone I don't want to.

38
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.410
And I'm very blessed to have that very few people have that.

39
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.670
And to have that be not only, um,

40
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.430
to have that be like rewarded and having people find that something of value to

41
00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:33.370
them makes me very, very happy, but also being an uncle, you know,

42
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.170
I have two little nephews there. They make me very, very happy.

43
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.950
I'm sure my sister's raising him Russian. So they talk like immigrants,

44
00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:43.850
but that's okay. We're going to change that. Um, we have to dismember her.

45
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:47.990
That's fine. That makes me happy. And like, uh, to be able to,

46
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.490
to be able to finish this book and know it's going to give people a sense of

47
00:02:52.491 --> 00:02:55.850
hope. That's really validating. Wow.

48
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.330
What are you most grateful for for our conversation?

49
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.410
<v 1>You're stealing my bet. What am I most grateful for?</v>

50
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.990
I am very grateful that I can come in here,

51
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.330
not knowing what we're going to talk about and know it's not going to

52
00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:18.760
be something I have to be on guard about,

53
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.130
or I have to watch my words and that neither you or your audience is going

54
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:27.880
to be, uh, responding derisively.

55
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.060
I feel safe here. You're welcome. But Steven,

56
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.950
thanks for talking to me. This is awesome.
