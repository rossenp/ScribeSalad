00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.710
<v 0>Is there some broader understanding of how we should think about alien</v>

2
00:00:07.711 --> 00:00:10.080
intelligences than, um,

3
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.710
like little green men that, um, the,

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.840
you can maybe elaborate on and talk about?

5
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.360
<v 1>Yes. This comes directly out of my research in Catholic history.</v>

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.440
What I found was that let's take, for instance,

7
00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:27.980
this idea of an angel. Okay. So we all think we know what an angel looks like.

8
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.110
Why? Well, we've been told what an angel looks like.

9
00:00:30.111 --> 00:00:32.060
We see what an angel looks like. Uh,

10
00:00:32.061 --> 00:00:35.030
throughout history people have painted angels and they all look pretty much the

11
00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:39.680
same. Um, but actually if you go to the primary sources on, you know,

12
00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:43.760
either in Hebrew or Greek or, you know,

13
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.400
in whatever language and in Latin,

14
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.590
and you look at experiences that people have talked about, you know,

15
00:00:51.591 --> 00:00:55.010
where they've written down, their experiences about angels, um,

16
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.810
angels don't at all look like what we think. They,

17
00:00:58.811 --> 00:01:02.360
they don't look like little cherubs with wings. They don't look like tall,

18
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.550
you know, strong anthropomorphic, you know,

19
00:01:07.551 --> 00:01:10.850
human looking things. They don't, they look really weird.

20
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.080
And sometimes they don't look at all humanoid,

21
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.360
they look like strange spinning things, right. With like, you know,

22
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.920
eyes and things like that. They, they communicate telepathically with us. Okay.

23
00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:27.110
So what does that mean for the idea of,

24
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.000
of extraterrestrials or what we consider the aliens? Like? Um,

25
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.250
do you think that they're first,

26
00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:41.210
if we are, if, listen, it's, I'm not the first to say this.

27
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.540
If we're in contact with non-human intelligence,

28
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.900
we're most likely in contact with its technology,

29
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.690
because think about us. Um, do we send human beings to Mars yet?

30
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.250
Some people will say yes, but let's put that aside. So, no, we don't.

31
00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:02.120
We use our technology, we send our rovers tomorrow's okay. Okay.

32
00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:06.740
So if there's an extraterrestrial civilization, is it sending,

33
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.110
are they coming by themselves?

34
00:02:09.111 --> 00:02:12.320
Are they coming to see us or are they sending their technology?

35
00:02:12.321 --> 00:02:16.880
Most likely they either our technology or they are sending their technology.

36
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.121
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

37
00:02:17.121 --> 00:02:20.540
There might be a gray area between what is technology and what the aliens are.

38
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.240
So, but you're saying like, um,

39
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.020
basically a robotic probe that would be the equivalent of us are human

40
00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:28.820
civilization created technology.

41
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.070
<v 1>Or w way more advanced than what we could believe to be appropriate.</v>

42
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.173
All right.

43
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.310
<v 0>It's kind of funny to think about like, if, uh, whatever, uh,</v>

44
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.050
sort of, uh,

45
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.720
extra terrestrial creations of visited earth that we're,

46
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.490
we're interacting with some like dumb, crappy drone technology.

47
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.970
And we're like, like

48
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.050
we're like building like myths and so on from like an experience with some like

49
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.530
crappy drawing made by some crappy startup somewhere

50
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.490
when the actual intelligence is like something that much grander.

51
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.840
Um, yeah. That's, that's, that's the more likely, uh, situation.

52
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.470
<v 1>That's what I like to tell people. I'm like, no,</v>

53
00:03:19.471 --> 00:03:21.450
it's probably a lot weirder than you think.

54
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.560
<v 0>Yeah. Oh boy. So, uh, what,</v>

55
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.300
what forms can it possibly take? So I really love this idea that, um,

56
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.770
I tend to be humble in the face of all of that. We don't know.

57
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.320
And I tend to believe that the form alien life forms would

58
00:03:40.321 --> 00:03:45.210
take and the way they would communicate is much more

59
00:03:45.211 --> 00:03:49.500
likely to be of a form that we can't even comprehend,

60
00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:53.190
or perhaps can't even perceive directly. So like,

61
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.200
you know, uh, it could be in the space of, you know,

62
00:03:58.201 --> 00:04:00.750
we don't understand most of how our mind works.

63
00:04:00.751 --> 00:04:03.210
It could be in the space of whatever the heck consciousness is.

64
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.620
Like maybe consciousness itself is communication,

65
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.440
uh, with aliens or like, I don't know. Uh,

66
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.150
it could be just our own thoughts is actually the

67
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.610
alien life forms communicating. Like, I don't know all of that sounds crazy,

68
00:04:23.611 --> 00:04:24.444
but I'm saying like,

69
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.090
I'm just trying to come up with the craziest possible thing that doesn't make

70
00:04:27.091 --> 00:04:29.460
any sense that could very well be true.

71
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.930
And you can't say it's not true because we don't understand basically anything

72
00:04:33.931 --> 00:04:37.650
about our mind. So it could be all of those things, uh,

73
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.970
everything from the hallucinations, all the things that are explored through,

74
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.070
uh, through the different drugs that we've, um,

75
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.810
talked about on this podcast in general,

76
00:04:48.811 --> 00:04:52.740
Joe Rogan loves to talk about DMT and all those kinds of [inaudible] drugs,

77
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.870
all of it, including love and fear,

78
00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.460
all of those things that could be aliens,

79
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.350
communicate with us memes on the internet.

80
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.240
That could be pretty sure humor is alien communication. Now, I don't know,

81
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.433
but, uh,

82
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.210
is there some way that's helpful for you to think about beyond the little green

83
00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:13.044
men.

84
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.730
<v 1>Really? And, um, it occurs exactly with how I think actually. Um,</v>

85
00:05:17.731 --> 00:05:19.800
so I'll explain. Um,

86
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.400
I liked in American cosmic,

87
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.420
I attained the status of full professor. So I was like, okay,

88
00:05:27.421 --> 00:05:30.030
I can pretty much write this book. Like I want to do it. And I did.

89
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.500
So I use a lot of quotes from cool artists, like David Bowie. Okay.

90
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.770
So David Bowie opens the book. Okay. And he basically says,

91
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.120
and so doesn't eat you by the way, David Bowie and Nicha boom, two, two,

92
00:05:42.121 --> 00:05:44.310
awesome quotes write together. That's how I opened my bar.

93
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.560
<v 0>Opener. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

94
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.090
<v 1>Of course. So the first,</v>

95
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.780
the quote by David Bowie and that's what I'm going to concentrate on in response

96
00:05:51.781 --> 00:05:55.500
to what you just said, which I think is absolutely correct. Um,

97
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.060
David Bowie said the internet is alien life form. Okay.

98
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.830
And if you've not seen David Bowie's interview where he says that I highly

99
00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:06.200
recommend it. He's so brilliant. Okay.

100
00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:10.070
So David Bowie is actually quite brilliant about the idea of UFO's.

101
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.250
He's also brilliant about the idea of technology. Okay.

102
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.200
And most people wouldn't think that, but I mean, he's pretty darn smart. Okay.

103
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.650
So, all right. So I started to think about it. And, uh,

104
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.390
I also early on in my research met jock valet. Okay. So he's a technologist. Uh,

105
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.260
he has a PhD in information technology from a computer science,

106
00:06:30.261 --> 00:06:33.560
basically from Northwestern. And he got that back in the day. You know,

107
00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:35.660
when I say back in the day, I'm not talking 2000 years ago,

108
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.100
I'm talking like in the sixties. Okay. So he's computer science. Wasn't really,

109
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:41.180
even, it wasn't even,

110
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.740
he has a PhD in it and he's French, he's from France,

111
00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:48.500
but he lives in Silicon Valley and he worked on ARPANET,

112
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.640
which is the prodo internet. He mapped Mars. He's also an astronomer. I mean,

113
00:06:52.641 --> 00:06:54.470
he's just this all around brilliant guy. Right.

114
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.660
And he's also interested in UFO's and most people take those two interests of

115
00:06:59.661 --> 00:07:01.460
his, a separate interests.

116
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.540
And I remember being at a very small conference and listening to him, uh,

117
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.800
being an off course because he's an odd spiring person. And then thinking,

118
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.390
wait a minute, why do people to compartmentalize those two things about him?

119
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:19.610
They're one in the same. Okay. So when we talk about UFO's and UAPs and stuff,

120
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:24.080
we have to talk about digital technology and things like that. Now,

121
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.920
if we're going back to what I, so if I were to say,

122
00:07:27.921 --> 00:07:32.630
what if I were to believe in, and I, like I said earlier, I was agnostic,

123
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.720
borderline unbelief, most likely believer in these,

124
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.980
this extra terrestrial or not extraterrestrial, let me put it another way.

125
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.830
Non-human intelligence, that's communicating with us.

126
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.140
I'm going to tell you how I think they communicate with us.

127
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.480
And I go back to the Greeks again. Okay.

128
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.400
And the Greeks had this idea of muses, you know, the muses. So, okay.

129
00:07:52.401 --> 00:07:55.610
So there are these things called muses and we tend to think of them as

130
00:07:55.611 --> 00:07:58.190
metaphors. Right. But what if they're not,

131
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.330
what if they're actually non-human intelligence trying to communicate with us,

132
00:08:02.331 --> 00:08:06.320
but we're so stupid. We can't like understand like, so only people with like,

133
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:10.700
you know, super amazing, um, capacities,

134
00:08:10.701 --> 00:08:15.560
like poetic, creative, you know, intelligent, mathematical, whatever,

135
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.810
you know, cause they tend to do this symbolically.

136
00:08:17.811 --> 00:08:22.430
They tend to communicate with us in symbols form. And so music, you know,

137
00:08:22.431 --> 00:08:25.340
symbols, we've got math that are, you know, it's a symbolic language.

138
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.840
And so what, so, okay.

139
00:08:26.841 --> 00:08:31.700
So muses are probably a good idea for me of what this would

140
00:08:31.701 --> 00:08:34.760
be now would muses have spaceships, you know,

141
00:08:34.761 --> 00:08:39.530
or those things that we call physical counterparts to what they are.

142
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.050
Um, that's another question altogether.
