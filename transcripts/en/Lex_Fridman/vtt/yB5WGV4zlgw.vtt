00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.920
<v 0>The following is a conversation with Nick Carter,</v>

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.440
who is a partner at castle island ventures,

3
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.240
co-founder of coin metrics.io and previously a crypto asset

4
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.520
research analyst at fidelity investments. He's a prominent writer,

5
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.880
speaker and podcaster on topics around decentralized finance and a

6
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.830
spec actually Bitcoin quick mention of our sponsors,

7
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.790
the information athletic greens for Sigmatic and Blinkist.

8
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.510
Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

9
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.070
This conversation with Nick Carter is part of a series of episodes on

10
00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:43.390
cryptocurrency. That is a small journey of exploration I'm on because I,

11
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.580
and decentralized finance and especially Bitcoin fascinating technically and

12
00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:49.414
philosophically,

13
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.980
especially because it may be the very mechanism that achieves a global

14
00:00:53.981 --> 00:00:55.380
decentralization of power,

15
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.380
giving more sovereignty to the individual and making our systems more resilient

16
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.580
to corruption manipulation.

17
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.810
And in general of the darker size of human nature.

18
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.850
Please let me also address something for a few minutes that happened recently.

19
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.770
That's been weighing heavy on me.

20
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.170
If you find me annoying to listen to please skip to the actual conversation with

21
00:01:17.171 --> 00:01:21.370
Nick. I had a recent podcast episode with Anthony Pompano,

22
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.440
where we spoke about Bitcoin and life in general for three hours,

23
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.520
I was curious, inspired, positive, or at least I tried to be,

24
00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:35.440
as I usually do someone clipped out out of context,

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.040
a short segment of me mumbling, something about having a PhD.

26
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.320
And I started getting mocked online because that made it convenient for people

27
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.431
to me,

28
00:01:45.431 --> 00:01:50.350
for being yet another quote unquote expert who learns about Bitcoin and

29
00:01:50.351 --> 00:01:51.350
thinks he knows everything.

30
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.270
I almost never mentioned that I have a PhD except to make fun of myself as I

31
00:01:57.271 --> 00:02:01.270
was doing, or at least trying to do in the full context of the conversation.

32
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.620
I brought up grad school as a random example of one of the many journeys I've

33
00:02:06.621 --> 00:02:10.820
taken. That was hard, but where the destination was in itself,

34
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.300
not very useful. I was saying,

35
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.820
I enjoy exploring with a curious mind and am willing to be patient, to learn,

36
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.500
to listen, to humble myself with knowledge, for the sake of knowledge itself.

37
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.050
Grad school was an example of that. The P D means nothing.

38
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.170
At least to me, I never call myself an expert or at least try not to,

39
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.490
because that would be dumb because I know how little I know

40
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.690
I'm not a influencer or a thought leader or whatever else,

41
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.570
silly self aggrandizing label people put on their LinkedIn. I try to be the,

42
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.880
the opposite of what I was mocked for.

43
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.400
I tried to think deeply about the world to look for the beautiful ideas and the

44
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:55.640
minds of others, and to be inspired by them.

45
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.000
I wanted to say all this because psychologically it struck a bit of a blow.

46
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.440
It made me realize that even when I approach things with love, I may be mocked.

47
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.080
I may be divided. I may be taken out of context or even lied about,

48
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.400
but the growing platform, this is sadly only increasing.

49
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.910
I now have learned that there's people who are waiting for my missteps so they

50
00:03:19.911 --> 00:03:22.870
can point the finger, laugh and say, see,

51
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.870
I told you so that guy's a joke. He's a fraud as a fellow,

52
00:03:27.871 --> 00:03:31.510
human being. The knowledge of this is painful. Yes.

53
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.510
I know people tell me to toughen up.

54
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.390
And my life has been about strengthening my mind in the face of my limits.

55
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.500
The but I refuse to not be fragile and wear my heart and my sleeve.

56
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.500
It's who I am. In some sense, this is the immune system of the internet,

57
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.580
but let us be careful not to destroy the good ones in the process.

58
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.500
The Bitcoin community had to endure many years of attacks from quote unquote

59
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.410
experts and also fraudulent cryptocurrency effort that scam people out of their

60
00:04:01.411 --> 00:04:02.244
money.

61
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.490
This created a powerful immune system that fought the attackers and the

62
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:08.570
scammers. I understand this.

63
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.450
And I also understand that one of the beautiful aspects of Bitcoin is its

64
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:15.450
community of humans is decentralized,

65
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.280
but some small part of this community has come to enjoy that us versus them

66
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.000
battles. Sometimes for the sake of the battle in itself,

67
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.520
this happens in political discourse as well. I understand this,

68
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.360
but to my limited mind, it sounds like groupthink,

69
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.600
which has powerful defense mechanisms against bad ideas,

70
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.240
but has dangerous consequences.

71
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.470
If taken too far as many periods of human history that I often talk about

72
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.230
where the us versus them thinking has led to the suffering of many.

73
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.910
Again, I understand the value of this. As many Bitcoin has explained to me,

74
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.910
but it's not the way I, as a sovereign individual, choose to walk in this life.

75
00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:59.300
By the way,

76
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.980
none of this podcast should be treated as financial advice before Nick kindly

77
00:05:03.981 --> 00:05:08.100
gifted me with a hundred dollars worth of Bitcoin in hardware form.

78
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.020
I didn't own any, I'll probably buy some Bitcoin on cash app,

79
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.220
coin base and other platforms,

80
00:05:15.221 --> 00:05:18.580
and also transfer to a hardware wallet just to learn how to do it.

81
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.010
But other than that, I don't necessarily make, make wise investment decisions.

82
00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.290
Money is not a motivation for me personally. I try to avoid it. Actually.

83
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.610
I'm grateful for every day. I'm alive,

84
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.690
no matter how much money is in my bank account for long stretches in my life,

85
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.650
that number was very close to zero and I was always fortunate to be free and

86
00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:39.484
happy.

87
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.320
So I encourage you to listen to people much smarter than me for actual good

88
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:47.920
financial advice here. I'm just exploring ideas.

89
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.400
And as if this has not already gone on too long,

90
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.160
let me please make another comment on the style of discourse among some Bitcoin

91
00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.840
maximalist on platforms like Twitter. That in my humble view,

92
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.193
I may be wrong,

93
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.200
but I believe is not conducive to the nuanced empathetic exchange of ideas.

94
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.960
I very much look for and enjoy. Again. I appreciate their style of discourse.

95
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.080
I think I understand the value of it, but it's not my thing.

96
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.550
So I don't want to age in it. I want to hear the quiet voices in the room.

97
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.270
I look for people to inspire each other. And when we disagree,

98
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.270
I look for disagreement that is grounded in respect and empathy.

99
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.030
I think that mockery and diversion destroys the possibility of those nuanced

100
00:06:32.031 --> 00:06:36.270
conversations. It drives away the quiet, thoughtful, empathetic voices.

101
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.580
And I try to give those voices space to be heard, to shine,

102
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.300
to exchange ideas, whether we agree or disagree.

103
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.660
So if I happen to block you on Twitter, I block you with love.

104
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.620
Honestly, I will never speak poorly view or even think poorly of view.

105
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.340
I would love to hang out in person,

106
00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.250
give you a big old hug and talk about life over some beers.

107
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.290
If you see or hear me say something stupid,

108
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.370
which I'm sure I do often or something you disagree with,

109
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.490
and you still respect me as a human being,

110
00:07:09.491 --> 00:07:11.970
please show your love as I always do to you,

111
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.570
but also send me some links to blogs, books, videos, podcasts,

112
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:21.160
where people, why my stated idea may be totally wrong.

113
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.720
I love this kind of long form disagreement.

114
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.920
I humble myself every day by reading books and blogs by people much smarter than

115
00:07:28.921 --> 00:07:33.480
me. Sometimes it strengthens my ideas. Sometimes it totally changes them,

116
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:34.840
but I always learn,

117
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:40.550
this is a too long way of saying that I'm here trying to walk with

118
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.390
grace and with an open mind, a bit of patience and always love.

119
00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.310
If I make mistakes, cut me some slack. Like you,

120
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.270
I'm only human allegedly.
