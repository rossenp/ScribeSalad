00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.310
<v 0>How would you compare?</v>

2
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.410
So it seems like Elon Musk is more engineering centric,

3
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.380
but it's also, I think he considered himself a designer too.

4
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.270
He has a design mind. Steve jobs feels like he's much more ideas, space,

5
00:00:17.271 --> 00:00:20.450
design space versus engineering. Yeah. Just make it happen.

6
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.510
Like the world should be this way. Just figure it out.

7
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.820
<v 1>But he used computers, you know,</v>

8
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.010
he had computer people talk to them all the time.

9
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.040
Like Mike was a really good computer guy. He knew computers.

10
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.460
Couldn't do computer, meaning computer hardware, like hardware, software,

11
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.910
all with pieces. And then he would, you know,

12
00:00:37.911 --> 00:00:40.580
have an idea about what could we do with this next,

13
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.850
that was grounded in reality. It wasn't like he was, you know,

14
00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:48.020
just finger painting on the wall and wishing somebody would interpret it. Like,

15
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.310
so he had this interesting connection because no,

16
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.800
he wasn't a computer architecture designer,

17
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.960
but he had an intuition from the computers we had to what could happen. And.

18
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.270
<v 0>Essentially you say intuition because it seems like he was off a lot of</v>

19
00:01:05.271 --> 00:01:10.070
engineers in his intuition about what can and can't be done.

20
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.900
Those, the, like the,

21
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.380
what is all these stories about like floppy disc and all that kind of.

22
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.740
<v 1>Yeah. So in, in Steve the first round,</v>

23
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.450
like he'd go into a lab and look at what's going on and hate it and,

24
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.290
and, uh, fire people or, or ask somebody in the elevator,

25
00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:31.310
what they're doing for Apple, not be happy when he came back.

26
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.290
My impression was is he surrounded himself with a relatively small group

27
00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:39.980
of people and didn't really interact outside of that as much.

28
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.180
And then the joke was, you'd see, like somebody moving up,

29
00:01:43.181 --> 00:01:46.970
prototype through the quad with a, with a black blanket over it.

30
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.920
And that was because it was secret, you know, partly from Steve.

31
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.180
Cause they didn't want Steve to see it until it was ready.

32
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.510
<v 0>Johnny ive. And Steve is interesting. It's like, you don't want to,</v>

33
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.830
he ruins as many ideas as he generates.

34
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.690
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. It's.</v>

35
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.210
<v 0>A dangerous kind of line to walk.</v>

36
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.390
<v 1>I don't know if you have a lot of ideas, like, uh,</v>

37
00:02:11.391 --> 00:02:13.790
Gordon bell was famous for ideas. Right.

38
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.880
And it wasn't that the percentage of good ideas was way higher than anybody

39
00:02:16.881 --> 00:02:18.590
else. It was,

40
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.490
he had so many ideas and he was also good at talking to people about it and

41
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.720
getting into the filters. Right. And, you know, seeing through stuff.

42
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.050
Whereas Ilan was like, Hey, I want to build rockets.

43
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.520
So Steve was hire a bunch of rocket guys and Ilan would go read rocket manuals.

44
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.620
<v 0>So better engineer that sense. Like, or like more, uh,</v>

45
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.350
like a love and passion for the man.

46
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.570
<v 1>Yeah. And the details.</v>

47
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.420
<v 0>Too. Right. Well, I guess you had craftsmanship to a bit of a different kind of.</v>
