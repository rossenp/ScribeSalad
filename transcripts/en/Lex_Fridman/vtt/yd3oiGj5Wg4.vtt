00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.030
<v 0>Let's take a step into the world of studies, Timothy Leery.</v>

2
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.510
Who was he? And, uh, what were the most important ideas you've learned from.

3
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.310
<v 1>Him? Well, I, I did have the, um,</v>

4
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.550
opportunity to get to know him personally and to spend some time with him, uh,

5
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.900
Timothy leery. Um, well,

6
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.020
let's start with Nixon saying he's the most dangerous man in America.

7
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.260
&lt;laugh&gt; that's a good place to start. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. And,

8
00:00:33.261 --> 00:00:37.900
and why did Nixon say that it's because of this, uh, tune in,

9
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.940
you know, turn, turn on, tune in, drop out mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um,

10
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.170
Timothy Lee was just an incredible advocate for, um,

11
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.290
think for yourself, question authority. Those were things he said all the time.

12
00:00:51.291 --> 00:00:54.330
Think for yourself, question authority. He was a rebel. Um,

13
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.250
he was kicked outta west point. Um, he was a psychologist who,

14
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.800
um, was at Harvard for three years, from 60 to 63. Um,

15
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.080
before he got to Harvard, he had an experience with, uh, mushrooms,

16
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.433
um, in Mexico.

17
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.360
And that he said he learned more in that experience than he'd had in his entire

18
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.760
academic career before then, about how the human mind works.

19
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.200
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. And so he came to Harvard wanting to do, um,

20
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.830
her into psychedelics. Um,

21
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.790
and he did some very important studies, both of which, uh, well,

22
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.550
one was called the good Friday experiment,

23
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.870
which was whether psychedelics in religiously inclined people taking

24
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.030
souly in a religious setting,

25
00:01:41.031 --> 00:01:44.910
whether it could produce a mystical experience that took place at marsh chapel

26
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.540
at the Boston university, because it's a little bit subjective,

27
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.300
or you could say entirely subjective, what people describe happens to them. Um,

28
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.820
he wanted to do another study, which would be a more objective measure,

29
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.540
and that was called the Concord prison experiment. And that was the thought,

30
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:04.020
if you can give people, um, SYOC,

31
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.770
Ibin mystical of connection type experiences while they're in prison,

32
00:02:07.771 --> 00:02:08.604
when they get out,

33
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.850
they'll be more pro-social and they'll have reduced recidivism mm-hmm

34
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.690
&lt;affirmative&gt;. Um, so Tim did that.

35
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.130
He also did the naturalistic studies of giving loads of people celly and sort of

36
00:02:20.131 --> 00:02:24.610
writing down what their experiences were, the range of experiences later on,

37
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.960
um, in his time at Harvard, he just,

38
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.640
they started doing L S D and, um, LSD is more cerebral,

39
00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:36.320
longer lasting, not as reassuring in a way Asil Ibin uh,

40
00:02:36.321 --> 00:02:40.080
sometimes he used to say that, um, if they never got into LSD,

41
00:02:40.081 --> 00:02:43.680
they'd still be at Harvard &lt;laugh&gt; with thesy. Um,

42
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.920
so he was a great American psychologist,

43
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.750
but then &lt;affirmative&gt; and he got tired of the, uh,

44
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.590
psychology game you could say,

45
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.830
or he would say that he got more and more interested in, um,

46
00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.640
cultural change mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and various musicians and artists,

47
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.040
and all sorts of people started coming to him for the psychedelic experience

48
00:03:05.041 --> 00:03:07.520
that they are in a way for creativity, for other things.

49
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.240
So he started hanging out with, um, all sorts of, um, famous people or,

50
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.440
you know, creative people. And, um, he stopped, uh,

51
00:03:16.441 --> 00:03:21.310
going to classes all a lot. And, um, rom dos Richard Albert,

52
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.550
you know, had, um, given LSD to a student that,

53
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:27.783
um,

54
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.870
Roos was courageous enough to admit that he had the sexual interest in

55
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.670
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, uh, they weren't supposed to give it undergraduates.

56
00:03:35.671 --> 00:03:37.550
That was about the only time that they ever did it.

57
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.140
And it's psychedelics just getting more and more controversial.

58
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.460
Even in the early sixties,

59
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.580
eventually got kicked out of Harvard and then he became kind of a cultural icon

60
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.100
for the counterculture and, um, was hounded by,

61
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.460
uh, the police and Nixon and spent a lot of time in jail. I mean,

62
00:03:56.461 --> 00:03:58.500
he's incredible person. Um,

63
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.130
one thing that Ramdas said is that, um, Richard,

64
00:04:04.131 --> 00:04:07.090
Albert Ramdas said, um, I'm a rascal,

65
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:11.130
but Lee's a scoundrel &lt;laugh&gt;, what's the distinction. Um,

66
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.730
Rascal's like in good fun. A scoundrel is like, you can't quite trust them.

67
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.210
I think. Um, uh,

68
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.720
think that it's a spec of sorts. Yeah.

69
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.480
I think that leery was someone who a little bit got addicted to media attention

70
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.640
and ah, but I, I think that, um,

71
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.200
overall he gets blamed a lot for the, um, backlash against the sixties,

72
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.960
the shutdown of psychedelic research.

73
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.030
I think that he is unfairly blamed for a lot of that. Um,

74
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.870
I think when you look back at the sixties, my sense, the,

75
00:04:44.871 --> 00:04:48.550
the common narrative is that it was because psychedelics going wrong,

76
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.110
people took psychedelics, they weren't prepared, they had emotional breakdowns,

77
00:04:52.111 --> 00:04:54.630
they went psychotic, they killed themselves,

78
00:04:54.631 --> 00:04:59.550
they did this or that different problems of people taking psychedelics in, um,

79
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.100
context that they didn't and feel prefer safe in or,

80
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.300
or just they weren't prepared,

81
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:07.420
or they didn't know how much they were taking or all this that. So the,

82
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.060
the backlash was because psychedelics going wrong.

83
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.500
But I think the real reason while that did happen,

84
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.140
I think the real reason is psychedelics going right.

85
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.460
And people having this sense of connection. And then the opposite of what the,

86
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.370
I was hoping that it would kind of, um,

87
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.610
turn people inward and take them away from political struggles.

88
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.650
It actually motivated people once you actually, um,

89
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.530
have these psychological experiences,

90
00:05:33.531 --> 00:05:37.530
your attitude towards death changes also this idea of, um,

91
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.410
death becoming an intrinsic part of life. It's a natural cycle.

92
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.120
It's not so much. So I think people realize that,

93
00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.120
you know, while there's this, uh, billions of years have volution, you know,

94
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.000
infinity,

95
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.400
whatever that means in terms of time that we're here for a very limited time and

96
00:05:54.401 --> 00:05:55.920
they end up wanting to use their time. Well,

97
00:05:55.921 --> 00:05:59.440
they have a lessened fear of death and they want to build, uh,

98
00:05:59.441 --> 00:06:03.520
this paradise on earth here now instead of later. So a,

99
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.680
a lot of people really did get motivated to challenge the Vietnam war to work on

100
00:06:08.681 --> 00:06:11.840
the environmental movement, civil rights movement, women's rights movement,

101
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:16.440
anti TISM. And it was that challenge to the status quo that caused the,

102
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.230
a backlash. So leery is someone who, um, in 1990,

103
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.190
uh, we had a now maps. I started in 86. So in 1990,

104
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.110
we had this conference to raise money out in California and leery was there and

105
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.910
rondos was there.

106
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.990
And Ralph Metzner was there and Andy wild was there and Terrance McKenna was

107
00:06:33.991 --> 00:06:36.470
there and Dennis McKenna was there and all, all these, but there,

108
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.580
there was one point where, um, Tim was, uh,

109
00:06:40.581 --> 00:06:43.980
speaking and afterwards I was asking him some questions. And I, I said,

110
00:06:43.981 --> 00:06:48.940
do you have any advice for us on how to work with the government and on

111
00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:51.980
how to bring these psychedelics forward? That's what we're trying to do.

112
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.220
I've got this nonprofit for it. You know, we're trying to do this research.

113
00:06:55.221 --> 00:06:59.410
What is your advice on how to bring this forward and how to work with the

114
00:06:59.411 --> 00:07:03.490
government mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and he said, uh, the government &lt;laugh&gt;.

115
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.490
He said, I am so far past asking for permission for anything,

116
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:13.610
but I'm glad that you're doing it. &lt;laugh&gt; and then he held up my hand, like,

117
00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.170
you know, like passing the torch. Wow. So it was, uh,

118
00:07:17.171 --> 00:07:20.160
and that's one of my favorite or photographs of me and TA sort of like,

119
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.920
but it was the after this the government I'm so far past asking for permission

120
00:07:23.921 --> 00:07:26.160
for anything, but yeah, I'm glad that you are.
