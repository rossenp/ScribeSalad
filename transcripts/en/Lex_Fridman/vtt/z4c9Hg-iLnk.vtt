00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.690
<v 0>People sometimes ask me, you know, you go up in under communism,</v>

2
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:08.190
you know,

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:13.130
was there anything good about communism &lt;laugh&gt; and it's

4
00:00:13.131 --> 00:00:15.610
difficult for me to talk about it because it's not, uh,

5
00:00:15.611 --> 00:00:18.610
communism is one of those things that's looked down on, like without,

6
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.890
in absolutest terms currently,

7
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.120
but you could still in my per talk about the actual forget communism or whatever

8
00:00:26.121 --> 00:00:29.280
the actual term is, but you know, certain

9
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.120
ways that the society function that we can learn lessons from.

10
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.920
<v 2>And one of the things in the Soviet union that was highly prized is</v>

11
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.520
knowledge, not even know is wisdom.

12
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.110
The skill of invention of innovation at a young

13
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.950
age. So we're,

14
00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:55.430
we're not talking about a selection process where you pick the best students in

15
00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:59.750
the school to do the mathematics or to read literature.

16
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.750
It's like everybody did it, everybody.

17
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.060
It was almost treated as if anyone could be the next Einstein.

18
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.780
<v 0>Anybody could be the next, uh, I don't know, Hemingway James Joyce.</v>

19
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.340
And so you're forcing an education on the populace and a rigorous

20
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.740
deep education, like as opposed to kind of like, oh,

21
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.460
we wanna make sure we, um,

22
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.170
&lt;affirmative&gt; we teach to the weakest student in the class,

23
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.090
which American systems can sometimes do,

24
00:01:33.091 --> 00:01:36.530
because we don't wanna leave anyone behind the, the,

25
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.490
the Russian system was anyone can be the strongest student and we're

26
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:43.850
gonna teach you the strongest student and we're going to,

27
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.720
to pretend or force everybody, even the weakest student to be strong.

28
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.400
And what that results in it's obviously,

29
00:01:51.401 --> 00:01:54.760
this is what people talk about is a huge amount of pressure. Like it,

30
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.880
it's psychologically very difficult. This is why people struggle.

31
00:01:57.881 --> 00:02:00.200
When they go to MIT, this is very competitive environment.

32
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.880
It can be very psychologically difficult, but at the same time,

33
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.240
it's bringing out the best out of people.

34
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.550
And that mathematics was certainly one of those things and exactly what you're

35
00:02:10.551 --> 00:02:12.470
saying, which kind of clicked with me just now,

36
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.350
as opposed to kind of spelling B in the United States,

37
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.070
which I guess you spell, I'm horrible at this,

38
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.150
but it's a competition about spelling, which I'm not sure,

39
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.230
but you could argue doesn't generalize.

40
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.780
<v 2>Well to the future skills mathematics,</v>

41
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.980
especially this kind of mathematics is essentially formalized competition of

42
00:02:31.981 --> 00:02:34.020
invention of, uh,

43
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.060
of creating a new ideas. And that generalizes really, really well.

44
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.140
So that's, that's quite brilliantly put, I didn't really think about that.

45
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.180
So this is not just about the competition.

46
00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:50.010
This is about diff developing minds that, uh, will come,

47
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.730
come to do some incredible stuff in the future. Yeah.

48
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.010
Actually I wanna respond to a couple of things there. The first one is one, um,

49
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.400
which is this notion of whether or not that is.

50
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.000
<v 1>Possible in a non authoritative regime. I think it is.</v>

51
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.200
And that's actually why I spent some of my efforts before the COVID thing, uh,

52
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.200
actually trying to, uh, work towards there.

53
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.640
The reason is because if you think about it, let's say in America,

54
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.200
lots of people are pretty serious about training, very hard for football, yes.

55
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:20.150
Or baseball or basketball. All basketball is very, very accessible,

56
00:03:20.151 --> 00:03:24.270
but lots of people are doing that. Why? Well, actually I think that what this,

57
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:25.510
what, what,

58
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.990
what was going on with the authoritarian thing was at least the message that was

59
00:03:29.991 --> 00:03:34.710
universally sent was being a good thinker and a creator

60
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.390
of ideas is a good thing. Yes, exactly.

61
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.620
There's no reason why that message can't be sent that's right everywhere.

62
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.100
And I think it actually should be.
