00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:03.380
<v 0>From here.</v>

2
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:03.951
<v 1>Perspective.</v>

3
00:00:03.951 --> 00:00:08.000
Can you summarize the important events around this amazing saga that have been

4
00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:11.390
living through of wall street bets, the subreddit and GameStop,

5
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.010
and in general,

6
00:00:13.011 --> 00:00:16.520
just what are your thoughts about it from technical to the philosophical level?

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.700
<v 2>I think it's amazing. It's like my favorite story ever.</v>

8
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.270
Like when I was reading about it, I was like, this is the best. Um, and it's,

9
00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:29.690
it's also, you know, connected with my company, which we can talk about,

10
00:00:29.691 --> 00:00:31.880
but what I liked about it is like,

11
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.650
I like decentralized coordination and looking at the mechanisms that

12
00:00:36.651 --> 00:00:37.820
these are wall street,

13
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.250
bets users use to hype each other up to get excited to

14
00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:47.570
prove that they bought the stock and they're holding. Um, and,

15
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.020
and then also to see that how big of an impact that,

16
00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:55.850
that decentralized coordination had, um, it really was a big deal.

17
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.330
<v 1>Are you impressed by the distributed, uh, coordination,</v>

18
00:00:59.331 --> 00:01:02.360
the collaboration amongst, like, I dunno what the numbers are.

19
00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:07.250
I know numerous looking at the data after all of this is over and

20
00:01:07.251 --> 00:01:10.280
done. It'd be interesting to see, like from, uh,

21
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.990
a large scale distributed system perspective to see how everything played out.

22
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.440
But just from your current perspective, what we know,

23
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.420
is it obvious to you that such incredible level of coordination

24
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.860
could happen where a lot of people come together and distribute a sense there's

25
00:01:27.861 --> 00:01:29.630
an emergent behavior that happens after that?

26
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.270
<v 2>No, it's not at all obvious.</v>

27
00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:36.830
And one of the reasons is the lack of kind of like credibility to

28
00:01:36.831 --> 00:01:40.250
coordinate with someone you need to kind of make credible contracts or credible

29
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.870
claims. So if you have, um, a username on, uh,

30
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.880
our wall street bets, like some of them are like deep value is why.

31
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.850
<v 1>That's an actual username. By the way, we're talking about,</v>

32
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.760
there's a website called Reddit and there's subreddits on it.

33
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.550
And a lot of people mostly anonymous,

34
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.490
I think for the most part anonymous, uh,

35
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.270
can create user accounts and then can then just talk on forum,

36
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.220
like style boards. You should know what Reddit is.

37
00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:09.770
If you don't know what Reddit is, check it out. Uh,

38
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.370
if you don't know what red is, maybe go to, uh, the, uh,

39
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.930
awesome subreddit first. Aww, with cute pictures of cats and dogs.

40
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.310
That's my recommendation. Anyway.

41
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.350
<v 2>That'd be a good start to read it. When you,</v>

42
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.360
when you get into it more go to our wall three vets.

43
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.220
<v 1>It gets dark quickly. Oh, we'll probably talk about that too. Uh, so,</v>

44
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.580
so yeah, so there's these users and it's,

45
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.110
there's no contracts like you were saying.

46
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.740
<v 2>Contracts, the, the, the user anonymous. Um, but there are little things that,</v>

47
00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:39.380
that do help. So for example,

48
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.350
if you've posted a really good investment idea in the past,

49
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.510
that exists on Reddit as well, and it might have lots of upvotes. Um,

50
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.770
and that's also kind of like giving credibility to your next to your next thing.

51
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.360
Um, and then they are also putting up screenshots like this. This is the,

52
00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.090
these I, I, the trades I've made and here's a screenshot.

53
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.140
Now you could fake the screenshot, but, um, but, but still,

54
00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:09.130
it seems like if you've got a lot of karma and you've had a good performance on

55
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:10.030
the, on the community,

56
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.500
it somehow becomes credible enough for other people to be like, you know what?

57
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.150
He actually probably did put a million dollars into this and you know what?

58
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:20.740
I can, I can follow that trade.

59
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.700
<v 1>And there's a bunch of people like that. So you kind of, uh,</v>

60
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.510
integrating all that information together yourself to see like, huh,

61
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.470
there's something happening here.

62
00:03:28.471 --> 00:03:32.370
And then you jump onto this little boat of like behavior.

63
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.370
Like we should buy the stock or sell the stock.

64
00:03:35.371 --> 00:03:40.140
And then another person jumps on another person jumps on. And, uh,

65
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.170
all of a sudden you have just a huge number of people behaving in the same

66
00:03:43.171 --> 00:03:45.600
direction. It's like flock of whatever birds, right.

67
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.680
<v 2>Exactly. What was strange with this one. It wasn't just, let's all buy Tesla.</v>

68
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.410
We love Elon. We love the Tesla. Let's,

69
00:03:52.411 --> 00:03:57.000
let's all buy Tesla because that we've heard before. Right. Everybody likes,

70
00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.930
um, Tesla. Well, now they do. Um,

71
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.820
so what they did with this, in this case, they're buying a stock that was bad.

72
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.650
They're buying it because it was bad.

73
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.670
And that's really weird because that's a little bit, um,

74
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.980
to galaxy brain for, for us decentralized community. Um,

75
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.650
how did they come up with it? How do they know that was the right one?

76
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.980
And the reason they liked it is because it had really, really high,

77
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.230
short interest. It had been shorted, uh, more than its own, uh, flow,

78
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.670
I believe. Um,

79
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.720
and so they figured out that if they all bought this bad stock,

80
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.360
they could short squeeze some hedge funds and those hedge funds would

81
00:04:39.361 --> 00:04:42.600
have to put you late and buy the stock at really, really high prices.

82
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.740
<v 1>And we should say that shorted means that it's either a bunch of people.</v>

83
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.080
When you short a stock, you're betting on the F on the you're predicting,

84
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.990
the stock is going to go down and then you will make money if it does. And then,

85
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.850
uh, what's a short squeeze.

86
00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.500
<v 2>It's really that if you,</v>

87
00:04:58.501 --> 00:05:02.700
if you are a hedge fund and you take a big short position in a, in a company,

88
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.520
um, there's a certain level at which you can't sustain holding that

89
00:05:08.521 --> 00:05:11.970
position, right. Uh, there's no limit to how high a stock can go,

90
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.750
but there is a limit to how low it can go, right? So if you short something,

91
00:05:15.751 --> 00:05:17.640
you have infinite loss potential.

92
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.130
And if the stock doubles overnight like GameStop did, um,

93
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.490
you're putting a lot of stress on that hedge fund.

94
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.650
And that hedge fund manager might have to say,

95
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.840
you know what I have to get out of the trade.

96
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.510
And the only way to get out is to buy the bad stock that they don't want.

97
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.320
Like they believe will go down. Uh, so it's an interesting situation,

98
00:05:40.321 --> 00:05:44.850
particularly because it's not zero sum. If you say,

99
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.120
let's meet, let's all get together and make a bubble in watermelons,

100
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.990
you buy a bunch of watermelons. That price goes up, it comes down again.

101
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.260
It's this, it's a, it's a zero sum game.

102
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.820
If someone's already shorted stock and you can make them short squeeze,

103
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.420
it's actually a positive sum game. So yes,

104
00:06:01.421 --> 00:06:04.220
some Redditors will make a lot of money. Some will lose a lot,

105
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.930
but actually the whole group will make money. And that's really, uh,

106
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.800
that's really why it's such a clever thing for them to do.

107
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.620
<v 1>Uh, coupled with the fact that shorting, I mean, maybe you can push back,</v>

108
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.520
but to me, always from an outsider's perspective seemed,

109
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.600
I hope I'm not using too strong of a word, but it seemed almost unethical.

110
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.880
Maybe not unethical. Maybe it's just the thing to do. It's okay.

111
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.730
I'm speaking, not from an economics or financial perspective,

112
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.470
I'm speaking from just somebody who loves. I'm a fan of a lot of people.

113
00:06:38.471 --> 00:06:41.080
I love celebrating the success of a lot of people.

114
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.700
And this is like the stock market equivalent of like

115
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:50.620
haters. I know that's not what it is. I know that there's efficient.

116
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.850
You want to have in the economy, efficient mechanism for punishing, uh,

117
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.480
sort of over-hyped overvalued things.

118
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.730
That's what short Angus is designed for,

119
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.770
but it just always felt like these people are just because they're not just

120
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.080
betting on the loss of the company.

121
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:13.090
It feels like they're also using their leverage and power to manipulate

122
00:07:13.091 --> 00:07:18.070
media, or just to write articles or just to hate on you on social media.

123
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.850
And then you get to see that with the all mosque and so on. So,

124
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.550
so this is like the man,

125
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:29.740
the sh people like hedge funds that were shorting are like the,

126
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.670
the sort of embodiment of the evil,

127
00:07:33.671 --> 00:07:37.570
or just the bad guy, the over powerful, this misusing their power.

128
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:41.260
And here's the crowd. The people are standing up and rising up.

129
00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:46.120
So it's not just that they were able to collaborate on wall street

130
00:07:46.121 --> 00:07:50.230
bets to sort of effectively make money for themselves. It's also,

131
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.790
this is like a symbol of the people getting together and

132
00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:59.680
fighting the centralized elites, the powerful, and that, you know,

133
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.660
I don't know what your thoughts are about that in general, at this stage,

134
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:09.430
it feels like that's really exciting that people have

135
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.990
power just like regular people have power at the same time.

136
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.980
It's scary a little bit, because, you know,

137
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:22.810
just studying history, people could be manipulated by charismatic leaders.

138
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:29.110
And so like, uh, just like Ilan right now is like manipulating, uh,

139
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:32.560
encouraging people to buy doors coin or whatever. Uh, the, the,

140
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:36.940
like there can be good charismatic leaders and there could be bad charismatic

141
00:08:36.941 --> 00:08:39.820
leaders. And so it's nerve wracking. It's,

142
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:44.260
it's a little bit scary how much power subreddit can have to, uh,

143
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:45.730
destroy somebody,

144
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.510
because right now we're celebrating there might be attacking or destroying

145
00:08:49.511 --> 00:08:51.520
somebody that everybody doesn't like,

146
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:56.490
but what if they attack somebody that is actually good for this world? So that,

147
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.170
and that's kind of the,

148
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.970
the awesomeness and the price of freedom

149
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.230
is like, it could destroy the world or can save the world.

150
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.580
But at this stage it feels like, I don't know. Overall, when you sit back,

151
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.750
do you think this was just a positive wave of emergent behavior?

152
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.610
Is it because there's something negative about what?

153
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.330
<v 2>Well, yeah, the, the cool thing is the, they weren't doing anything. The,</v>

154
00:09:22.331 --> 00:09:25.980
the red people weren't doing anything, um, exotic. It was,

155
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.740
it was a creative trade, but it wasn't exotic. It wasn't,

156
00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:35.660
it was just buying the stock. Okay. Maybe they bought some options too, but,

157
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.680
um, it was the hedge fund that was doing the exotic thing. Um,

158
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:44.030
so I liked that. It was, it's hard to say, well, you know,

159
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.690
we've got together and we put all pooled all our money together,

160
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:52.220
and now there's a company out there that's worth more. What's wrong with that.

161
00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:56.480
Yeah. Right. But it doesn't talk about, you know, the motivations, which is,

162
00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.880
and then we destroyed some hedge funds in the process.

163
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.860
<v 1>He said about the, the humor. And, um,</v>

164
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:09.140
I don't know the edginess, sometimes viciousness of that subreddit.

165
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:10.880
I haven't looked at it too much,

166
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.800
but it feels like people can be quite aggressive on their, uh,

167
00:10:15.801 --> 00:10:20.420
so is there, what is that, is that,

168
00:10:20.421 --> 00:10:22.880
what is that, what a freedom looks like?

169
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.320
<v 2>I think it does. Yeah. You definitely need to let people, the,</v>

170
00:10:27.321 --> 00:10:31.100
one of the things that people have compared it to is the occupy wall street.

171
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:35.990
Right. Which is, let's say, you know, some very sincere, uh, liberals,

172
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:40.310
like 23 years old, whatever. And they go out with signs and they,

173
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.470
they have some kind of case to make. Um, but this isn't sincere, uh,

174
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.550
really, um, it's like, um, a little bit more nihilistic,

175
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:51.950
a little bit more Yolo. Um,

176
00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.460
and therefore a little bit more scary because he's scared of the,

177
00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.370
who's scared of the wall street, occupy wall street, people with the signs.

178
00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:03.050
Right. Nobody, but these hedge funds really are scared. I was scared of the, uh,

179
00:11:03.051 --> 00:11:07.100
of the wall street, bets people. I'm still scared of them. Yeah.

180
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.150
<v 1>The anonymity is a bit terrifying and exciting.</v>

181
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.020
<v 2>Yeah. I mean, yeah. I.</v>

182
00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.120
<v 1>I don't know what to do with it. You know, I've been following events in Russia,</v>

183
00:11:17.121 --> 00:11:19.010
for example, it's like,

184
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.700
there's a struggle between centralized power and the distributed. I mean,

185
00:11:22.701 --> 00:11:27.140
that's the struggle of, uh, the history of human civilization. Right. But this,

186
00:11:27.141 --> 00:11:32.000
on the internet, just that you can multiply, uh,

187
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:34.670
people, like some of them don't have to be real.

188
00:11:34.671 --> 00:11:39.510
Like you can probably create bots. Like it starts getting me,

189
00:11:39.511 --> 00:11:43.280
me as a programmer. I started to think like, Hmm, me is one person.

190
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:47.540
How much cash can, can I create by writing some bots? Yeah.

191
00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:53.060
And I'm sure I'm not the only one thinking that, uh, there's,

192
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.300
I'm sure there's the hundreds, thousands of, uh,

193
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.420
good developers out there listening to this thinking the same thing.

194
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.950
And then as that develops further and further in the next decade or two,

195
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.870
what impact does that have on financial markets on just destruction

196
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.040
of, uh, reputations of just,

197
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:16.420
or politics, you know, the, the bickering of left and right.

198
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:21.420
Political discourse, the dynamics of that be manipulated by, you know,

199
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.750
people talk about like Russian bots or whatever. I,

200
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.800
we're probably in the very early stage of that. Right. Exactly. And, uh,

201
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.300
this is a good example. So do you have,

202
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:36.760
do you have a sense that most of wall street bets folks are actually individual

203
00:12:36.761 --> 00:12:40.090
people, right. That that's the feeling I have is there's just individual,

204
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.630
maybe young investors just doing a little bit of an investment,

205
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:44.830
but just on a larger scale.

206
00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.610
<v 2>Yeah, exactly. The reason I found out, well,</v>

207
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.960
I've known about all three reds for a while,

208
00:12:48.961 --> 00:12:51.540
but the reason I found about GameStop was this just,

209
00:12:51.541 --> 00:12:55.230
I met somebody at a party who told me about it and he was like 21 years old.

210
00:12:55.231 --> 00:12:58.350
And he's like, it's going to go up a hundred percent. And the next one day.

211
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.720
<v 1>We're talking about in last year.</v>

212
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.590
<v 2>Uh, this was probably, no, this was yeah. A few days ago when I, yeah.</v>

213
00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:09.180
It was like maybe, um, maybe two weeks ago or something. Um,

214
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:12.360
so it was, it was already high game stuff. Um,

215
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:16.410
but it was just strange to me that there was someone telling me at a party, uh,

216
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:21.300
how to trade stocks, who was like 21 years old. Um, and, uh,

217
00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:26.440
and it started, yeah. I started to look into it and, um, yeah, he did make,

218
00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:31.380
he made it, I made 140% in one day. Uh, he was right. And now he's,

219
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.830
um, you know, supercharged, he's a little bit wealthier and now he's gonna look,

220
00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:35.880
wait for the next thing.

221
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.850
And this decentralized entity is just going to get bigger. Yeah.

222
00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:41.520
<v 1>And they're gonna together search for the next thing.</v>

223
00:13:41.521 --> 00:13:43.320
So there's thousands of folks like him,

224
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.070
and they're going to probably search for the next thing to attack people that

225
00:13:47.071 --> 00:13:51.750
have power in this world that sit there with power right now in government and

226
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:53.100
in finance,

227
00:13:53.101 --> 00:13:57.360
in any kind of position are probably a little bit scared right now.

228
00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:02.730
And honestly, that's probably a little bit good. It's dangerous, but it's good.

229
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.030
<v 2>Yeah. It certainly makes you think twice about shorting.</v>

230
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.060
And certainly it makes you think twice about putting a lot of money into a

231
00:14:09.061 --> 00:14:13.470
short, like these funds put a lot into one, one or two names.

232
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.990
And so it was very, very badly risked managed.
