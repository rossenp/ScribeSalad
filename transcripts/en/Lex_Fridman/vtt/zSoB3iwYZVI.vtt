00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.600
<v 0>Who was Isaac Newton?</v>

2
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.640
What are the things he contributed to this world in the space of ideas?

3
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.880
<v 1>Wow. &lt;laugh&gt; uh, who was he?</v>

4
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.640
He was born in, uh,

5
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.840
1642 in, uh,

6
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.230
near the small town of Grantham in England. In fact,

7
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.030
the house he was born in and that his mother died in is still there and can be

8
00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:34.070
visited. Uh,

9
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.470
his father died before he was born. Uh,

10
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.140
and his mother eventually remarried a man named Reverend

11
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.540
Smith whom Newton did not like at all.

12
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.450
Uh,

13
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.300
because Reverend Smith took his mother away to live with him a few

14
00:00:56.301 --> 00:01:00.220
miles away, leaving Newton to be brought up more or less by his grandmother.

15
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.653
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; over there.

16
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.170
And he had huge resentment about that his whole life.

17
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.490
<v 0>I think that gives you a little inkling that, uh,</v>

18
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.690
a little bit of trauma in childhood may be a complicated father.

19
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.370
Son relationship can be useful, uh, to create a good scientist.

20
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.490
<v 1>Could be, although this case it would be right, the, you know, absent father,</v>

21
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.130
non father relationship, so to speak. Gotcha.

22
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.480
He was known as kid little that we do know for, uh,

23
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.520
being very clever about, uh, flying kites. And, uh,

24
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.600
there are stories about him putting candles and putting flying kites and

25
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.560
scaring the living devil out of people at night by doing that and things like

26
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.470
that, making things most of the, um, uh, uh,

27
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.150
physicists and natural philosophers I've dealt with actually, uh,

28
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.190
as children were very fond of making and playing with things.

29
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.070
I can't think of one I know of who wasn't actually,

30
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.790
they very good with their hands and whatnot. Uh, he, uh,

31
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.140
was, uh, his mother wanted him to take over the manner.

32
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.420
It was a kind of farming manner. They were the class of one known as Yemens. Uh,

33
00:02:15.421 --> 00:02:19.060
there are stories that he wasn't very good at that one day.

34
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.820
One of the stories is he's sitting out in the field and the cows come home

35
00:02:22.821 --> 00:02:27.130
without him. And he doesn't know what's going anyway, uh,

36
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.530
ad relatives. And, uh, he manages to get to Cambridge sent to Cambridge,

37
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:33.850
cuz he's known to be smart.

38
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.650
He's read books that he got from local dignitaries and some relatives.

39
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.410
Uh, and he goes there as what's known as a subor what does that mean? Well,

40
00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:45.010
it's not too pleasant. Basically.

41
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.800
A sub was a Stu who had to clean the bed pans of the Richard

42
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.200
kits. Okay. Right. Uh, that didn't last too long. He makes his way.

43
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.820
Um,

44
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.480
and he becomes absorbed in some of the new ways of

45
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:06.000
thinking that are being talked about on the parts of Decart

46
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.360
and others as well. There's also the traditional curriculum,

47
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.560
which he follows and we have his notes. We have his, uh,

48
00:03:13.561 --> 00:03:15.000
student notebooks and so on.

49
00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:19.950
We can see gradually this young man's mind focusing and

50
00:03:19.951 --> 00:03:24.910
coming to grips with deeper questions of the nature of the world and

51
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.030
perception even,

52
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.310
and how we know things and also probing and learning, uh,

53
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.070
uh, mathematical structures to such an extent that he builds on

54
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.700
some of the investigations that had been in this period before him to

55
00:03:41.701 --> 00:03:46.660
create the foundations of a way of investigating processes that

56
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:51.420
happen and change continuously instead of by leaps and

57
00:03:51.421 --> 00:03:55.820
bounds. And so on forming the foundation of what we now call the calculus. Yeah.
