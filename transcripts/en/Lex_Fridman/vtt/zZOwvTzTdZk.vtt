00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.690
<v 0>Can you, can you elaborate a little bit about the nature of</v>

2
00:00:08.691 --> 00:00:11.610
volatility? Why is it communicating truth?

3
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.850
That's something that a lot of people are afraid of is the volatility.

4
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.890
Almost like it's a, it's a sign of chaos. Mm.

5
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.360
And so they want to escape chaos us,

6
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.160
but you're saying that that's actually, uh, whether it's chaos and, or not,

7
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.720
I don't know, but it's getting us closer to the fundamental,

8
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.080
like reality that we should not be trying to escape.

9
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.540
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.120
So if we consider that the universe is

11
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.880
pervaded by entropy, right?

12
00:00:42.881 --> 00:00:46.470
This is the second law of thermodynamics is that every closed system tends

13
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.390
towards greater disorder over time. And that life itself, again,

14
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.390
I would argue expressed through the logos.

15
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.110
We life is the anti Tropic principle.

16
00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:01.310
It's the only thing that's converting entropy into order chaos into order.

17
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.940
And that's what entrepreneurs are doing, right.

18
00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:10.740
We're living at the edges of the known. And we're trying to we're, we're,

19
00:01:10.741 --> 00:01:13.100
we're testing ourself against the entropy of nature,

20
00:01:13.101 --> 00:01:16.260
trying to figure out new and better ways of saying, doing, or making things.

21
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.620
And then if we do crack a code or figure something out,

22
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.980
we then have a big incentive. The incentive is to get rich, right?

23
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.690
Because then you have a new idea that you could then sell back into the

24
00:01:25.691 --> 00:01:28.690
marketplace. So it's this

25
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.490
sequence of courageously confronting the entropy of nature and converting it

26
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.490
into good and useful order, which by the way,

27
00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:41.690
is like the ancient idea of God and Genesis, which I think is interesting, um,

28
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.520
that actually enables us to civilization in these layers of

29
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.360
anti entropy or order you might say.

30
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.280
So today we live in a bubble of,

31
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.520
of anti entropy or order, you know, like the,

32
00:01:57.521 --> 00:02:01.160
the coastlines are guarded by the nation and the city has a certain, uh,

33
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.150
police force that keeps it in order. Um, even the way we,

34
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.070
we talk like there, clearly the words matter, but also the non-verbal cues,

35
00:02:10.071 --> 00:02:14.110
all these things are like order that has been established over many, many,

36
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.030
many thousands of years of, of human evolution. And

37
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.470
I think that's when I say volatility is truth.

38
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.340
What I'm saying is that the experience of uncertainty &lt;affirmative&gt;,

39
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.980
it's something that's in era from, from life, right? Uncertainty.

40
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.620
Like it, it, it's kind of a paradox because it's, we're fighting against it,

41
00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:34.941
right.

42
00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:38.540
We're trying to innovate our way away from uncertainty to give us to create more

43
00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:42.660
capital mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, which capital is very simply, uh,

44
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.300
a way of mitigating uncertainty.

45
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.290
So this is why you might have like a stash of food in case, you know,

46
00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:52.370
the power goes out or a generator like it helps you overcome uncertainty over

47
00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:57.250
time, but uncertainty is also where all the sweetness of life is &lt;laugh&gt;.

48
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.520
So there's gotta be this balance with one foot in one foot out. And.

49
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.880
<v 0>So human society is this kind of bubble of order that we've constructed and</v>

50
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.000
slowly expanding. But at the edges, you're always going to have that chaos,

51
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.400
that volatility and that the entrepreneurs, uh,

52
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.720
are kind of like jumping into that, uh, chaos and some of them die, uh,

53
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.790
and some of them succeed. And so like, if you want to grow this bubble of order,

54
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.190
you, you have to be embracing the volatility at the edges.

55
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.470
Yes. That, that.

56
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.870
<v 1>That &lt;laugh&gt; and reverence for entrepreneurship,</v>

57
00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.790
because these are the people putting their neck out,

58
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.950
so to speak risking themselves. And they're gonna contribute to society by the,

59
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.220
whether they go up in flames or not. If they go up in flames,

60
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.140
society has witnessed their experience as something not to do or something that

61
00:03:46.141 --> 00:03:49.180
doesn't work in a particular time and place so that you could say,

62
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.180
they're them going up in flames is a way of lightning the rest of us,

63
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.900
or if they figure something out. Oh, true. You know,

64
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.860
Steve jobs creates the iPhone, changes the world forever, so,

65
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.490
and lightening the rest of okay.

66
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.130
&lt;laugh&gt; and EB would say with the fire of their failure. Okay. Yeah, exactly.

67
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.810
&lt;laugh&gt; EB would say, um,

68
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.410
individual fragility is inseparable from ensemble anti

69
00:04:13.411 --> 00:04:16.490
fragility. So this means that again,

70
00:04:16.491 --> 00:04:20.560
every time that entrepreneur goes up in flames or say a restaurant goes outta

71
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.280
business, when a restaurant goes outta business,

72
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.040
that particular cuisine strategy they were implementing in that particular time

73
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.720
and place, that's a signal to all the other restaurants in the area that,

74
00:04:29.721 --> 00:04:30.554
that doesn't work.

75
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.880
So restaurant food improves from bankruptcy to bankruptcy.

76
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.161
So it's this,

77
00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:40.440
this death of the individual components that contributes to the growth of the on

78
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.030
ensemble.
