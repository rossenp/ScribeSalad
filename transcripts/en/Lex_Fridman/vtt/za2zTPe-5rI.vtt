00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.040
<v 0>How does this whole thing and, uh,</v>

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.480
probably in tears for who who's crying is everybody crying.

3
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.993
<v 1>Who's crying. When,</v>

4
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.330
so I think there were some of the hedge funds that were crying initially that

5
00:00:14.331 --> 00:00:17.480
maybe some of the wall street bets, people who bought last would be crying.

6
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.220
And then eventually there's probably another set of hedge funds or even the wall

7
00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:25.040
street bets mob, and the, you know, that army,

8
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.600
some of them might've broke ranks and then shorted the stock. So nobody knows.

9
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.330
So everybody has to be aware of what's happening in the game.

10
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.920
So if wall street bet said, Hey,

11
00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:36.770
let's squeeze these hedge funds because they have too much short interest.

12
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.720
Let's all buy the stock. Then some of them might've said, okay, you know,

13
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.150
it's at three, two or $300. Maybe I'll join the short movement.

14
00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:45.290
Now that they've covered.

15
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.500
And they could have shorted there in been like double agents.

16
00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:52.190
So people have to understand, like, this stuff is gnarly and it's a,

17
00:00:52.191 --> 00:00:54.230
it's a free for all. I mean, it is a literal free.

18
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.150
<v 0>There's a kind of morality,</v>

19
00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.920
like a big statement that lost your bets made in terms of like the elites

20
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.630
can't just push us around. They can't bully around. But at the same time,

21
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.860
you know, they're also interested in making money, right? Because it is, uh,

22
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:10.760
what's your sons.

23
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.100
You said that some of the people in the wash your best might've broken off and

24
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.930
shorted the stock, are they more interested? There was an emergent,

25
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.590
like morality that emerged and said, like,

26
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.230
we're not going to put up with the centralized leads,

27
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.730
but is that going to continue or are they going to fight the power

28
00:01:28.731 --> 00:01:32.600
structures that are bad for society? Or are they going to now, like,

29
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.900
I mean, are they ultimately going to introduce more chaos?

30
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.300
That's going to damage the economy and damage the world,

31
00:01:38.301 --> 00:01:42.200
or are they going to continue being the good guys and fighting the, uh, the,

32
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.090
the, the evils that manipulate, uh, the market was your sense?

33
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.140
<v 1>You know, it, it really feels like the dark nights series of films where like,</v>

34
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.210
some people just want to see the world burn.

35
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.290
I think there is a contingent of people who just literally want to see chaos.

36
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.920
Like, you know, that contingent on some of these, you know,

37
00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:04.070
forums who just want to create chaos. Right? Yeah. Um,

38
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.960
so there there's certainly that chaos contingent,

39
00:02:05.961 --> 00:02:09.650
but I think overall what the arc will show is a group of people getting

40
00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:11.870
massively educated. You see it in crypto as well.

41
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.580
There was like a three-year period where all of these failed

42
00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:21.440
entrepreneurs who I knew who couldn't build companies were then coming

43
00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:25.130
back to me after their companies has failed or after they gave up,

44
00:02:25.131 --> 00:02:27.650
or couldn't clear market raising money with the venture capital community.

45
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.960
And they were doing ICO's and I was like, I met you before. Right.

46
00:02:32.961 --> 00:02:35.210
And they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I'm doing an ICO now. I'm like, okay,

47
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.050
where's your company at? And they're like, here's a white paper.

48
00:02:39.051 --> 00:02:42.890
And I was like this white paper with spelling errors in it that says you're

49
00:02:42.891 --> 00:02:46.640
going to destroy Airbnb because everybody's apartment is going to be on an

50
00:02:46.641 --> 00:02:48.380
immutable ledger. Like,

51
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.740
wouldn't that be better in a regular database that was private and not public?

52
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.710
Like, why does it need to be on an immutable ledger? So it can't change.

53
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.320
I'm like not changing the database is a feature that's that does not seem a good

54
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:01.360
feature. And they couldn't explain it. They're like, well,

55
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:04.090
just people are interested in ICO's and there was that ICO mania.

56
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.060
And what it showed was there's a global appetite for risk.

57
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.420
People want to try new things.

58
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:13.120
This is one of the great things about the human spirit is one of the great

59
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:14.080
things about capitalism.
