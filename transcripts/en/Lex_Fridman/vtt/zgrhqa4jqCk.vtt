00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.950
<v 0>I do find it kind of interesting. Uh, it is NFT based, but, uh, I,</v>

2
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.310
I don't think it has to be this &lt;laugh&gt;, uh, this idea of,

3
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.950
I think big clout it's called or whatever, uh,

4
00:00:15.951 --> 00:00:18.070
the idea of sort of investing in individuals.

5
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.350
It makes me immediately think about investing in ideas.

6
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.220
So even just the words you speak, having value and sort of,

7
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.740
if you have a frictionless like automated financial system,

8
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.580
then you could do a bunch of interesting things about what it means to add value

9
00:00:38.581 --> 00:00:39.414
to the world.

10
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:40.653
<v 2>I,</v>

11
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.490
I don't know if bit cloud is currently an efficient representation of that. Um,

12
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.090
but I am truly happy that &lt;laugh&gt;,

13
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.450
however, that thing works. I'm just one notch above LA or Putin,

14
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.650
which is one of the, that's like one of the bucket list items for me to,

15
00:00:59.651 --> 00:01:02.170
to have a list where I'm one notch above Putin.

16
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.360
<v 1>Well, but I think you're talking about here is important because there's, uh,</v>

17
00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:07.480
historical examples.

18
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.600
You could invest in a patent in some situations you could invest in an

19
00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:14.720
organization that has an idea, right?

20
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.440
So these are super inefficient given kind of the,

21
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.040
the vision that you're painting in terms of like investing directly in an idea

22
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.920
in a super efficient, automated fashion. Yeah.

23
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.310
But that's how the technology evolution would works. Right.

24
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.630
Is it's really hard to do it first.

25
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.950
And then it slowly kind of becomes easier and easier as technology, uh,

26
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.843
is more prevalent.

27
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.870
The other thing that I think is interesting is this whole idea of investing in

28
00:01:34.871 --> 00:01:35.650
people.

29
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.670
If you really think about the origination of that is I would hire somebody.

30
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.750
Right, right. I pay you money and then you're gonna create production. Sure.

31
00:01:43.751 --> 00:01:48.420
But I take the lion share and you don't now there's things like, uh, these, uh,

32
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.860
ISAs these income sharing agreements where basically I will educate you on

33
00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:56.580
something, train you on something, uh, I'll put up capital. Right.

34
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.300
And then over time you'll pay me back.

35
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.260
Plus profits is some version eventually, I don't know what it looks like,

36
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.970
but being able to upside in somebody's success

37
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.330
for having risk capital early on,

38
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.210
doesn't seem that far off mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you see it in professional

39
00:02:13.211 --> 00:02:15.090
sports, you see it in, you know, a lot of these things.

40
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.770
And so I just think that a lot of, um,

41
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.530
the focus right now is on the technology,

42
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.010
but ultimately these are ideas that are very old and have had

43
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.440
lots of success and traction.

44
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.680
And we're just merely standing in the way of the evolution of these ideas with

45
00:02:31.681 --> 00:02:36.000
new technology. And so, uh, it's easy to get caught up in the technology,

46
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.680
but when you really zoom out and look at it from the ideological standpoint and

47
00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:42.840
kind of the, the progress of humanity, it's a foreground conclusion.

48
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.833
This stuff's gonna happen.

49
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.320
<v 0>Yeah. It's just how I think the world is waiting.</v>

50
00:02:46.321 --> 00:02:50.630
It's some of us are trying to create that future world, which is like,

51
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.950
what are the applications of this technology that will transform the world?

52
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.710
And then, you know, I hate the term, but killer apps,

53
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.760
like cool ideas that are implemented effectively at scale that

54
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.080
transform the world. And there's been,

55
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.720
there's been a lot of different ideas pro popping up,

56
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.920
like the there's a lot of ideas about social networks that are built on top of

57
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.320
the technology and all that kind of stuff.
