00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.830
<v 0>Man, I just hosted or didn't host Jesus. I warmed up for the VMs and I,</v>

2
00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:09.210
you know, you don't know who the hell anybody is. Well, I saw on news, I'm 34.

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.550
I saw on your Instagram. You said you bombed,

4
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:12.960
were you being cute or did you bomb?

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.290
I haven't bombed like that since the eighties. I mean, it was,

6
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.280
it was beyond the box. Did they introduce you? It was the whole,

7
00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:21.114
the whole thing was.

8
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.900
I got a phone call two days before and I had to cancel a bunch of spots. Like,

9
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.280
do you want to warm up the VMs? I was like, Oh my God, good money. Radio city.

10
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.130
They'll pick up a limo, put a suit on the whole thing.

11
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.280
You'll get to see all the celebrities. Not realize that you don't know anymore.

12
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.990
So they go, all right, the show is at nine. We'll pick you up at six. You know,

13
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:43.470
they always do that. So I put my suit on, which I never do. I go down there,

14
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.200
they'd get a limo. I bring a lady with me like, Oh, I'm an impress her.

15
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.690
I like what you do with your suit. Let, let them tie and let it, I'm done.

16
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.130
Throw it over a beam. Exactly.

17
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.870
That's a Louis CK Rolex, by the way, allow me that. Oh, is that right? Yeah.

18
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.830
For the tour and for, so I do it.

19
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.450
So a you show up,

20
00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:08.390
you get there like six 30 and all these people start filing in.

21
00:01:08.391 --> 00:01:11.750
I'm in this holding pen for all the talent and I'm with the girl and she's

22
00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:13.280
younger. She's in her twenties. So she's like,

23
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.540
that's the guy from one direction. That's BB. She's a big star girlfriend. Yeah.

24
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.820
I see. She's a big star in England. And I'm like,

25
00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:22.520
I don't know who I am in a suit. They're all hot and hip.

26
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.980
I felt like a principal. Right. You know, I'm running around.

27
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.040
Nobody else was wearing suits. Nobody, nobody. They're all wearing crazy.

28
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.380
And I'm all. Kylie Jenner. It's a whole thing.

29
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.910
So I started getting kinda nervous. I started panicking. Like,

30
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.880
no one's telling me anything. No, one's going, Hey, you're on at this time.

31
00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:39.890
This is what we need you to do. I'm getting no info.

32
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.020
And everybody's running around with a headset and a clipboard,

33
00:01:42.021 --> 00:01:45.890
like chick nightmare, nightmare. They've been doing it 40 years.

34
00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:49.970
Why can't they do it? Right. I don't get it. It's still a show. I feel when I.

35
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.140
Yeah. It's a, it's a circus down there. So now it's like,

36
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.920
I'm supposed to do 10 minutes and now it's like eight, 10, eight 30.

37
00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:03.470
And I'm like, the show starts at nine. When are they going to have me on?

38
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.770
And now I'm starting to get that thing. Like maybe they'll just forget about me.

39
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.420
I'm hoping like, I'll get my paycheck. I showed up. They picked me up.

40
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.060
They'll just forget. And I'll just go home. And uh, so now it's like eight 58.

41
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.500
I'm like, I think I'm out of this. I tell you to be clean or no,

42
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.250
everything clean. Don't talk about Trump. Don't talk about kids in cages.

43
00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:26.510
Like nothing in the news. So now it's like eight 58. I'm like, I think I,

44
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.750
I got out of this and then this fat guy comes in with cargo shorts and goes,

45
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.650
Mark Norman, the whole place turns I go, Hey, that's me. And he goes,

46
00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:35.120
get over here. You're on. I go,

47
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.130
Oh my God brings me through the bowels of a radio city has million

48
00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:44.510
people everywhere. Sorry. See you, man. Go through the motions.

49
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.590
But you went from I'm relieved. Like you finally had that moment of, okay,

50
00:02:48.591 --> 00:02:52.070
it's not happening. Exactly. Instantly find out. Not only is it happening,

51
00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:56.360
it's happening right now. No time to warm up. No time to think. Go. Yes.

52
00:02:56.361 --> 00:02:57.800
And it's open bar down there.

53
00:02:57.801 --> 00:03:01.720
So I've been hitting tequilas day for like three hours. So finally he's like,

54
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.560
come, he's pulling me through all these like half B celebrities and Bravo stars,

55
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:08.170
you know? And I get, get out there and you're just out there. Holy.

56
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.980
You're in radio city and I'm behind the curtain and this old guy with a,

57
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.500
with the headset goes, all right. So, uh, you know,

58
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:17.380
all the names of the artists, you've got the rap sheet and I was like rap sheet.

59
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.830
He goes, they didn't prep you. I was like, no. And he's like, well, what's this,

60
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:23.440
I'm holding a piece of paper. And he goes, is that the list of the artists?

61
00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:26.650
I go, no, these are my jokes. And he goes jokes. Oh,

62
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.280
the gig. I thought I was going to be doing stand up. And he was like, stand up.

63
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.800
No, you're the hype man. You gotta get out there and talk about all the,

64
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.660
the acts you like and whose song is. So you hear warmup and you think warmup,

65
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.830
copy. They warm up. And they mean just like, man warmup.

66
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.430
Totally see Cardi B hand, like clap stuff. You know?

67
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.640
Like put your heads together on this side. No, this side, all that.

68
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.190
Like yes, like the t-shirt gun. Right? Exactly.

69
00:03:57.191 --> 00:04:01.270
You're more than master of ceremonies completely. Then a comedian and you go,

70
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.520
Oh no, I don't know how to do that. I'm a piece of. Dry. I got nothing.

71
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.850
Although that's an easier thing. Yelling at people. This side of the room,

72
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.070
make noise. That side Bay to see that. If you hear the names,

73
00:04:14.071 --> 00:04:17.050
that's easier to know the names though. He's not prep. Right. That's right.

74
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.530
And I've never done that for, I find that silly and retarded.

75
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.640
It stinks and it takes zero talent. And I've worked at my, I know my act,

76
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.600
my act works,

77
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.720
but not in this setting because it's half about Jews and Puerto Ricans and

78
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:31.990
whatever. So, so he goes, you just do a 10 minutes.

79
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.470
I'll come get you at nine. I'm like, come get me delight me.

80
00:04:35.471 --> 00:04:37.060
He's like a light knew he didn't know anything.

81
00:04:37.061 --> 00:04:38.530
We were all we're on two different planets.

82
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.650
Cause you're talking standup comedy and nobody is interested. No,

83
00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:44.380
he doesn't care. So, uh, he's like, all right, you're all.

84
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.180
He just pushes me out there with a cordless mic.

85
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.100
So did you have the names of people? He never gave it. So I'm just,

86
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.640
he's just like, go, go. He's like shooing me out. And I just walk out there.

87
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:55.960
It's three tiers,

88
00:04:55.961 --> 00:05:00.130
5,000 people smoking hot girls are all 21. You know,

89
00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:02.080
all these hot guys and weird outfits,

90
00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:05.470
like blazers with no shirt under it and crazy hair. Probably celebrities,

91
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.210
celebrities. So I just go on and go, how are you guys doing? I get like a,

92
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.030
you know, like no one cares. They're all. Selfieing,

93
00:05:13.031 --> 00:05:15.400
they're all tweeting and looking at each other. And it's like smoking.

94
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.270
It's it's all the people you got into comedy to please. Like,

95
00:05:19.271 --> 00:05:21.010
these are all high school people who made fun of me.

96
00:05:21.011 --> 00:05:24.490
And now I'm trying to impress them again. And they hate me again.

97
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.080
Plus it's like, you're doing very well, but you're not like a celebrity.

98
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.500
Nobody. And they're excited to see celebrities on the stage. Yes.

99
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.190
And I'm just some dude in a suit. Right. I look like a, like a,

100
00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:39.580
like the accountant of the VMs nobody's wearing suits. No,

101
00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:41.770
nobody's wearing a suit. So I get out there and I'm like,

102
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.570
how are you guys doing it? I'm like, eh. And I'm like, all right.

103
00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:48.340
So I kind of go into my act and that is they're like, what are you doing? Ah,

104
00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:52.180
I'm embarrassed just at the tonight show like a week before this.

105
00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:54.910
So I was feeling pretty good. Like I, I, I know what the kids like.

106
00:05:54.911 --> 00:05:56.200
So I do a joke about selfies.

107
00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.990
Cause they're all selfieing and even the setup they didn't even hear.

108
00:05:59.991 --> 00:06:04.580
So then the punchline, I was like here at gums, nothing.

109
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.120
What's the punchline. What's the job. Got it. It works.

110
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.400
So I talked about how a women, they're all, they know how to look good.

111
00:06:13.401 --> 00:06:16.460
So they take a self, they figure it out to take the selfie up here.

112
00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:18.110
It's cause they know where the good sight lines are.

113
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.520
That's why women like tall guys.

114
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.430
Cause it's just some guy looking at you from your breast angle a hundred percent

115
00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:22.941
of the time.

116
00:06:22.941 --> 00:06:26.630
And that's why you don't like short guys because you're just a guy looking up at

117
00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:28.220
you going look at the triple chin on this broad

118
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.940
[inaudible]. But that's what happened out there. Uh, that was,

119
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.710
that was just a car crash. This was like a train derailing story. Mark.

120
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.410
The hard part is when you, I don't.

121
00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:59.500
<v 1>Any relative experience,</v>

122
00:06:59.501 --> 00:07:02.320
but I remember one time do I think it was opening for Dyson,

123
00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:03.760
the crowd was being really awful.

124
00:07:03.761 --> 00:07:08.290
And I remember doing my opening thing and they didn't hear the set up,

125
00:07:08.291 --> 00:07:10.090
but I needed a punchline. And you like, you're like,

126
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.190
this is going to bomb because they didn't hear my setup.

127
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.640
There's no way to fix this. This isn't my fault.

128
00:07:15.641 --> 00:07:19.300
But there's nothing else I can tell you got to do sometimes is spend a few

129
00:07:19.301 --> 00:07:24.130
seconds or a minute getting them focused and then sneak into

130
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.300
the opening joke. Do the stuff that you hate to do, you know,

131
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.470
just get them all going. If you can get it, it stinks. But you.

132
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.660
<v 0>Probably wouldn't opening with that. You probably.</v>

133
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.130
<v 1>Thought that's exactly what you were doing.</v>

134
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.600
Because since they're all taking selfies.

135
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.470
<v 0>Right? Let me start with the, Oh, this guy's talking about selfies.</v>

136
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.530
And he listened to, it was my game plan and the joke works.

137
00:07:44.531 --> 00:07:47.830
It works at clubs though. It got zero. Like they didn't hear the setup,

138
00:07:47.831 --> 00:07:50.830
like you said. And once they don't hear the setup, you're dead in the water.

139
00:07:50.831 --> 00:07:52.780
And then they're just going, this guy sucks. And you're like, no,

140
00:07:52.781 --> 00:07:55.330
you missed the setup. You cuts. This is what the joke got.

141
00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.950
<v 1>So what happened? What was the second thing you did after that? Didn't work.</v>

142
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.190
<v 0>So after that I'm like, all right, let's go in a, let's call an audible.</v>

143
00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:07.450
Let's go into crowd works. I go, who's from New York. Who's not from New York.

144
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:10.570
Who's from out of town. I'm doing all it's babysitting. That's all it is.

145
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:14.140
<v 1>But that is the you got to do with that. And this guys who are good at that.</v>

146
00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.870
<v 0>And it's an art, it's an art it's really.</v>

147
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.080
<v 1>Hard to do. Like I never on warmup guys who looked down on it.</v>

148
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.760
That's a hard job, man.

149
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.510
<v 0>Yeah. So I am dying. So now I'm just trying to like with people in the crowd.</v>

150
00:08:25.511 --> 00:08:29.290
And you know, I'm trying to stay true to myself as a guy walking by with this.

151
00:08:29.291 --> 00:08:31.750
And then I go, Oh, I bought Coke from him. And everybody's like, why would,

152
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:32.980
why would you say that? And I'm like,

153
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.320
this guy looks like a pedophile and that Gallagher.

154
00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.910
And so I'm bombing a bombing and J-Lo,

155
00:08:39.911 --> 00:08:43.600
and a rod walked past me, literally like four feet away from me. And you know,

156
00:08:43.601 --> 00:08:46.210
when you're bombing, you just reach for anything. So I go,

157
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.940
ah J-Lo and I just reach out for, and she goes

158
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.500
like hides and onstage because she had to cross, um,

159
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.540
there's like three different stages, like a mosh pit.

160
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:01.440
And I'm on one of the States. So she had to go over my stage to get to her area,

161
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.590
tried to kidnap chain. And you're not even supposed to look her in the eye,

162
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:09.480
let alone go. Gee, someone say that, Oh yeah. That's part of her writer.

163
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:11.790
Like that's her thing. You can't look her in the eye.

164
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.060
So I'm like reaching out for an, a Roz. It's like, Ooh, this poor guy.

165
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:19.410
And they both looked amazing by the way, but they didn't stop and talk to you.

166
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.940
Oh God, no, no. I was trying to at least wave to everybody. No.

167
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.130
And they went right to their Thrones and I was just like, Oh,

168
00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.380
I used you at Jesus. So now I'm back to the girl, by the way,

169
00:09:30.381 --> 00:09:34.130
she's watching this debacle. No, she's in the back. None of this is televised.

170
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.630
Thank God. Did it help you,

171
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:38.480
you with the audience when you reached out for J-Lo and she didn't even look at

172
00:09:38.481 --> 00:09:40.280
you? Yeah, no. They were like, Oh, he's definitely a creep.

173
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:44.750
Like we hate you more. Now if Kayla had stopped by to get me some clout, right?

174
00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.430
So now I'm bombing and bombing. I tried another joke that ah, shut up.

175
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.530
That goes right to hell. And eventually I'm just like,

176
00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.480
I go into fight or flight mode where I go, look,

177
00:09:56.481 --> 00:09:59.900
I don't know why I'm here either. What the am I doing? Why did they hire me?

178
00:09:59.901 --> 00:10:01.280
This sucks. I hate this.

179
00:10:01.281 --> 00:10:05.990
This is stupid were saying that you have to fill air. You got to fill time.

180
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.310
So you have to keep talking.

181
00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.600
And I look over and the old guy with the headsets going get up,

182
00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:15.080
get up and he's waving me in. And I was like, Oh thank God. I was like,

183
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:19.400
thank you everybody. And they're clapping. Like he's leaving God, he's leaving.

184
00:10:19.401 --> 00:10:23.090
And I was like, ah, God, they hated me. And I go over to the guy and he goes,

185
00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.250
he did eight and a half. I couldn't take it.

186
00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.080
Nobody could take it. And they're like watching me in the booth, like,

187
00:10:30.081 --> 00:10:34.160
who's this guy, what is this? And they pulled me off. Yeah.

188
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.770
They didn't prep me at all. And I got back to the, to the green room area.

189
00:10:36.771 --> 00:10:39.290
And the girlfriend was like, well, what happened? That was like two seconds.

190
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.870
Y'all you're done already. I was like two seconds. I'm covered in sweat.

191
00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.480
My pants are disheveled. My ties around my.

192
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.330
It was the whole picture right there. So I'm bombing.

193
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.710
This is my buddy Scott Rakowski. It was the only guy laughing. He does that.

194
00:10:51.711 --> 00:10:54.140
He's the HQ guy. He's an old friend of mine,

195
00:10:54.141 --> 00:10:56.630
but it was one guy laughing in the crowd. And it was him.

196
00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:59.360
Was he laughing at your jokes or laughing at you? He was laughing at the bomb.

197
00:10:59.361 --> 00:11:04.100
So he took a photo and it said hashtag hell gig. Oh,

198
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.900
Mark bombing at the VMs.

199
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:10.130
Funny that when that picture is taking take you're in the middle of your set.

200
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.790
Yeah. Yeah. That's how bad it was. He gets people's backs to you.

201
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.030
Those are the people behind me in the mosh pit area. They weren't even looking.

202
00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:20.900
No, I was just playing to the, uh, the, the, the crowd looking forward.

203
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.330
They don't even, they didn't even turn around.

204
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:25.850
They were not going to look at the empty state. God, no,

205
00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:29.870
they had the best seat in the house. They couldn't see me. Right. That was a,

206
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:33.980
that's a rough gig. Oh, it was bro. 5,000 people look how happy Seth is though.

207
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:39.080
He's dying. Scott, Scott. Sorry. Yeah. He's loving it. He loves it. I mean,

208
00:11:39.081 --> 00:11:43.010
to be able to be bombing so bad that someone can take a selfie with you while

209
00:11:43.011 --> 00:11:46.640
you're bombing. He literally stopped and looked. I love that.

210
00:11:46.641 --> 00:11:50.330
You're posing for the photo. I would've, I would've sworn that.

211
00:11:50.331 --> 00:11:54.340
That was after the gig. And you guys were both. I wish that's how bad it was,

212
00:11:54.341 --> 00:11:57.820
where I was like, I need to fill 30 seconds with you coming up here. I was like,

213
00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.430
take a photo of me, Scott. And he was like, all right. He came up and I'm like,

214
00:12:00.431 --> 00:12:02.770
yeah, this guy, he loves it. I'm bombing. I'm just saying.

215
00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:05.730
<v 1>Do you know? I would literally.</v>

216
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:10.860
<v 0>Hey, however much a ticket costs to watch your 10 minutes. Oh,</v>

217
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.560
my there was another lender dudes. Yes. Yeah.

218
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:18.090
He was in the crowd and he was filming me and he was like, this,

219
00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.900
Diane out there, like he's tagging me. Uh,

220
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:25.650
it was like blurry and he couldn't hear it. But uh, I, I have it on my phone.

221
00:12:25.651 --> 00:12:28.380
I want to see that footage. Do you more than that?

222
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.570
<v 1>I want a different angle of the JFK assessment.</v>

223
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.270
<v 0>Oh God. Yeah. I would love to watch that. What at least killed on that</v>

224
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:41.730
now? Did you stay and watch the VMA? No, I, uh, the girl was like,

225
00:12:41.731 --> 00:12:44.250
we got to go out there, Ariana Grande's and I was like, all right.

226
00:12:44.251 --> 00:12:47.610
And I stood in the back and I sucked down like four tequilas and lime.

227
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.430
And then we watched like 10 minutes of it and got the hell out of there.

228
00:12:50.431 --> 00:12:52.710
She managed to leave her. No, no. She was like, this sucks.

229
00:12:52.711 --> 00:12:55.470
We didn't have a seat. They didn't give me a seat. It was a whole thing.

230
00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.310
We didn't exactly urgency. No, no, no. Maybe in the electric chair or something,

231
00:12:59.311 --> 00:13:01.620
but a lot of that, that old guy felt sympathy for you.

232
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.950
<v 1>There you go. Saw the crowd. I love a good bow.</v>

233
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:08.010
What's better than a comedian friend bombing in front of five.

234
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:11.330
It is literally that's the way it was killed. It would have been like,

235
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.680
all right, cool. It's what you do anyway.

236
00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.100
The fact that you had to bomb and swim and it was all yeah.

237
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.510
<v 0>What swim in a suit. What an awesome gig to bomb it. Yeah, exactly.</v>

238
00:13:21.511 --> 00:13:24.690
That's perfect. It's supposed to vomit. I'm kind of supposed to bomb.

239
00:13:24.691 --> 00:13:27.510
And I got the story the whole time going. I got a story from my podcast.

240
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:32.460
It'll be fun to tell. And um, I get to say I played radio city, which is like,

241
00:13:32.461 --> 00:13:35.550
you know, always a dream. I've got Carnegie hall, radio city and uh,

242
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.040
Madison square garden. But when people go like, Oh, you played radio city,

243
00:13:38.041 --> 00:13:38.874
how did it go?

244
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:41.250
<v 1>Terrible bombed.</v>

245
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.340
<v 0>Bombed in front of 5,000. That's a bad gig though man gig.</v>

246
00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:47.520
But at the paycheck cleared and even, uh, Kevin Hart,

247
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.220
when he went up his jokes for doing.

248
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:52.530
<v 1>K he wasn't killing when he was presenting the award with Tiffany has just a</v>

249
00:13:52.531 --> 00:13:53.364
tough kick for anybody.

250
00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.580
<v 0>No, Kevin jokes were good at, in the room,</v>

251
00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:59.430
but he was playing specifically to like a teenage audience.

252
00:13:59.431 --> 00:14:01.560
Like his jokes would have done fine on MTV,

253
00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:03.930
but when you took it out of that context and like,

254
00:14:03.931 --> 00:14:06.210
you just watched the video as like, you know, Oh yeah.

255
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:11.090
34 year old people or older. Um, yeah, they didn't wait. They,

256
00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.010
they don't work as, as comedy jokes. And there was no host there.

257
00:14:14.011 --> 00:14:17.040
No one wants the host to say, no one wants to be there. Like cat Hart was there.

258
00:14:17.041 --> 00:14:20.070
He got the out right after Jimmy found, got the hell out right out.

259
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.810
You just do your 10 minutes and you get out of there.

260
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.770
Is that why they don't have a host for sometimes nobody wants to do it.

261
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.800
It's like a it's antiquated. Like Sarah Silverman dev disease.

262
00:14:28.801 --> 00:14:31.410
Did it Schumer did it? Kevin Hart did it at one point, but it's,

263
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.080
it's just a paycheck. Yeah. And you get to, you know,

264
00:14:34.081 --> 00:14:36.570
be in front of a bunch of kids. So you stay a little more relevant.

265
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:37.920
<v 1>Yeah. I'd love to do it.</v>

266
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:44.370
<v 0>Horribly bomb. Yeah. Oh yeah. Thank God that wasn't televised lobbying to do it.</v>

267
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:48.030
You want a warm up or you want to host them. You want to host the VI.

268
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:49.920
You want to come up and host the VMs.

269
00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:53.120
I want to warm up one here to prove that they will enjoy me and then.

270
00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:57.550
<v 2>Maybe they can get chip. That would be a funny host.</v>

271
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:58.421
<v 0>I would love it.</v>

272
00:14:58.421 --> 00:15:01.870
Jim would just go up there and make references to like the late three pop

273
00:15:01.871 --> 00:15:03.040
culture, things that he knows,

274
00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:07.000
like he make reference to push it T and then you go to Sean Paul,

275
00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:10.930
and then he fall into the omen three go. Well, no,

276
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:15.340
I have to go to the bathroom badly. All right, well, let's take a break. Um,

277
00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:18.340
you're going to go, is it a one or two? It's a three

278
00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.490
combinations gotta come in. Someone's mouth. I'm on.

279
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.930
<v 2>A podcast.</v>

280
00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:29.320
<v 0>Is Tuesdays with stories of Mark Norman comedy.com.</v>

281
00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:29.830
<v 2>Right?</v>
