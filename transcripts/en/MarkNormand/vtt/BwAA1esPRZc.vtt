00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.470
<v 1>Hey comedy. Huh? You can see anal and Asians and Jews.</v>

2
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.380
I'm working on it. Peel. I say, Mark, gotta be more confident. I say,

3
00:00:12.381 --> 00:00:14.990
Mark gotta be yourself. I'm like, you got to pick one.

4
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.170
Hey delivery. I'm working on my delivery too, buddy. Corona has been so long.

5
00:00:21.171 --> 00:00:24.320
It feels like the check engine light. You know, at first you're scared of it.

6
00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:27.200
Then after a while you're like, it. I gotta go to work. You give it a snuff.

7
00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:29.810
The ladies, all your sexual stuff. That's all under wraps. Very hush,

8
00:00:29.811 --> 00:00:32.810
hush men walk around. I'm an man. I'm a boob man ever see a woman go.

9
00:00:32.811 --> 00:00:36.770
I'm a ball gal. Yeah. I love that sack.

10
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.830
I don't care if a lesbian compliments me, nothing gets lesbians,

11
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:42.830
but that doesn't help. My ego. You have a lesbian is like, Hey Mark.

12
00:00:42.831 --> 00:00:46.220
Like a haircut. I'm like, I know he have the same one. These poor kids.

13
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.920
They got to go to school at home. Now they're all homeschooled. You know,

14
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.580
that's sad.

15
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.730
How long until a teacher in Florida has cybersex with one of her students,

16
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.820
you know, what's going to happen here.

17
00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:58.490
Like in the fifties we had whites only and blacks only water fountain,

18
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.040
which is incredibly sad. Especially if you're a thirsty Asian.

19
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.443
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.710
<v 1>What the hell are they doing? Drinking out of a faucet? No one talks about it.</v>

21
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.500
Never come up once. Not a peep. Hey, good to be here. It's a, it's a pleasure.

22
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.050
I'm a little hung over a little gay, but uh,

23
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.440
just glad to be here with you, sister.

24
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.680
I don't know if any of you guys have kids that sucks for you guys with the

25
00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:24.020
schools being closed. It's actually good for me though.

26
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.690
Cause now I can drive by them again. Like ladies, you know,

27
00:01:26.691 --> 00:01:28.640
when you go out to dinner with a guy or like just cause you bought me dinner

28
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.380
doesn't mean I hear you six and that's true.

29
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.810
But just because you let me have sex with you, it doesn't mean I own my morning.

30
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.320
Right? It's the same exact transaction equality, right?

31
00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:42.440
This crowd's like anal. It takes a minute, you know? Oh,

32
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.980
this looks like you guys are waiting for a God smack to come on. Uh,

33
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.740
just me gonna make fun of some Jews and we'll all pack it up. I'm not racist.

34
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.130
I look at racism the same way I look at Nickelback. Yeah.

35
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.510
You know, it's uh, it's fun to joke about, but uh,

36
00:01:59.511 --> 00:02:00.650
you never want to see it live.

37
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.990
I'm hitting the streets to tell some jokes about this pandemic.

38
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.680
A lot of these flew right over people's head

39
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.530
I'm in therapy. Anybody else? Hey, there you go. A couple of people. Yeah.

40
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.350
You know, I'm doing this thing called exposure therapy. That's where your face,

41
00:02:18.351 --> 00:02:20.420
your fears. Scared of Heights. You take the hot air balloon.

42
00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:22.850
Scared of drowning takes you in the ocean. So he said, what are you scared of?

43
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.340
Mark? I'm claustrophobic and scared of intimacy.

44
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.680
So he took me a little closet and me.

45
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.550
Wasn't getting a hand job at the moment in the car. Oh, that guy. All right.

46
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.500
Well done, sir. I didn't know. The hand job was still around.

47
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.400
I'm pitching these shows. That'll never get sold and I'm at the Fox lot.

48
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.300
And you walk in. There's a big parking lot is a beautiful day.

49
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.290
This is open air courtyard. All these girls have their shoes kicked off.

50
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.320
They get their feet up on the table. There they're smoking vape pens.

51
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.050
They're drinking a coffee. They got the sunglasses on. I'm like,

52
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.960
you don't know what you got. This is amazing. You don't appreciate it.

53
00:02:56.961 --> 00:02:59.120
I know of any of it. This is your job. You're getting paid.

54
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.600
Probably like a hundred grand a year. We're going to at TV.

55
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:06.010
You're in show business. You got your shoes off at work. Yeah. You're living it,

56
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.530
living it. And they don't even know. They're like, uh,

57
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.320
Uber eats is taking a while and you're like, shut up. Cut.

58
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.520
You're you're you're living the dream. Well, he's like a high maintenance chick.

59
00:03:14.521 --> 00:03:16.290
Like you want to get inside me? You gotta here an hour early.

60
00:03:16.291 --> 00:03:19.050
Take your shoes off and do a body scan. You're like Jesus Christ.

61
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.560
I think I'm autistic. But just like the bad parts of it, you know?

62
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.790
Like I can't compute numbers or remember dates, but I'll make you feel weird.

63
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.573
Ah,

64
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.740
she whizzing. Okay. He's probably doing heroin in the Bordeaux. I get it.

65
00:03:45.741 --> 00:03:49.470
Good to have you back. How was that? Uh, heroin. There we are. All right.

66
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.070
Thanks for coming up. Great cleavage. I just put a special out.

67
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.250
I had a chatty Uber driver last week. That's the worst. Huh?

68
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.310
This guy wouldn't shut up. I forgot that the no smalltalk option on the app.

69
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.520
So I'd get creative. I just scare the guy into being quiet. He's like,

70
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.650
how about this traffic? Huh? What are the things causing this?

71
00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:06.470
I'm like probably the Jews. He's like

72
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.460
[inaudible] I love a roof gig. This goes horribly. I can just jump right off.

73
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.110
Now. You guys are more of a, maybe a query thing. Oh my gosh. Is it,

74
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.430
is it clean? Don't worry. I'm not cheating. These swastikas I've drawn air, um,

75
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.750
jokes, jokes. It does feel like at the end of this,

76
00:04:27.751 --> 00:04:30.510
we're going to sacrifice a liberal. Doesn't it? She was like, you know,

77
00:04:30.511 --> 00:04:32.580
I feel very brave tonight. I was like, why is that?

78
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.620
Because I'm not wearing any makeup. I was like, how's that brave?

79
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.380
Because I'm being my true self being the real me. I was like, Oh, okay.

80
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.390
She's like, you should be brave. I'm like, yeah, maybe I will. She's like,

81
00:04:39.391 --> 00:04:41.220
what are you going to do? I was, I'm going to stop pretending.

82
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.143
This is interesting.

83
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.420
[inaudible] so I wrote just a ton of. I got Corona, I got riots.

84
00:04:51.421 --> 00:04:56.220
I got anal. I feel like a, like a woman in arranged marriage. You know, I,

85
00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.480
uh, I didn't choose this. I got to cover my face. And if I say my opinion,

86
00:05:00.481 --> 00:05:03.390
I get yelled at. You're allowed to be hateful in America,

87
00:05:03.391 --> 00:05:06.030
as long as you're not specific. And that weird. If you're like,

88
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.960
I hate Mexican people. Everybody's like, Oh my God, what a bigot prejudice.

89
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.260
But if you're like, I hate people. Everybody's like right.

90
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.380
Hey, good to be here. Thank you for being here. Appreciate you having me.

91
00:05:18.381 --> 00:05:21.060
I'm hurting there, right? Hey,

92
00:05:21.061 --> 00:05:25.800
that's why I'm a comedian because I got to get love somewhere. Whoops. Sorry.

93
00:05:25.801 --> 00:05:30.720
Is that a meal? This is my first standup set back in like 84,

94
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.460
84 days. The hoops a lady with oops.

95
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.640
You can only tell a crazy woman. It's about the size of groups, right?

96
00:05:38.641 --> 00:05:43.080
That's where this comes from. Somebody write that down.

97
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.610
How about that? Fowchee? He's a bummer. Huh? I get, he's got a hard job,

98
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.460
but felt she was like a,

99
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.800
he's like a COVID Groundhog and hit out every time I see him on TV. I'm like.

100
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.000
Another six weeks of pandemic. I just watched a documentary on pedophile.

101
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.930
My friend, my friend goes, Oh, I could never have sex with a kid.

102
00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:00.764
They're so annoying.

103
00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:06.670
<v 0>I was like, that's it? Huh?</v>

104
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.660
<v 1>The NBA's we're with it. The empty stands. No,</v>

105
00:06:10.661 --> 00:06:12.130
we should do just to fill those up.

106
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.460
Let's take the racist statues and put them in the stands. Yeah,

107
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.430
like guys like that one. Alright. Why are you scared to laugh now?

108
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.070
Why these there is comedy.
