00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.340
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.460
<v 1>Every night, every night, every night I five shows last night.</v>

3
00:00:25.461 --> 00:00:30.020
I had three tonight. Oh my God. Are you from New York? New Orleans,

4
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.710
born and raised. So you moved down here then? Oh yeah. I moved out here.

5
00:00:33.711 --> 00:00:35.420
I did count for eight months. I was like, this is it.

6
00:00:35.421 --> 00:00:37.820
I finally found what I want to do. I don't care how hard it is.

7
00:00:37.821 --> 00:00:39.320
I'm going to make it work. And that was it. Right?

8
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.040
So that's the hustle moved to New York, uh, with 800 bucks in my pocket,

9
00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:46.130
I got mugged three times in a year. My landlord died of AIDS.

10
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.370
And the first day I was here, I had a pigeon in my apartment.

11
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.450
I worked in this building as a janitor for two years. I had a lot of fun.

12
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.450
<v 0>You smell like garbage and donkey.</v>

13
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.340
How are you sniff this? Ooh, that's her. See you later, Janet.

14
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.380
I believe that guy can't believe you up.

15
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.850
<v 1>Does anyone else sometimes feel like they're getting paid to be sick?</v>

16
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.860
I quit the day job and uh, 2011 best day of my life. I was a janitor.

17
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.910
Really? Yeah.

18
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.060
My floor is from nine to five and I would do open mics at night and shows a

19
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.990
night. And eventually, you know, after a while I just saved up a ton of money.

20
00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:44.090
I was super poor. I saved everything.

21
00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:49.040
I had got a TV spot on comedy central quitting the job the next

22
00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:53.330
day, I got quite a route schedule for tonight. Uh, yeah,

23
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.690
not in New York that much. So when I'm here, I really cherish the time.

24
00:01:56.691 --> 00:01:59.210
I'm only here on like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,

25
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.450
you leave Thursday to do weekends on the road,

26
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.230
going to Philly this weekend and Montreal, it's going to be a good year.

27
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.960
<v 2>I've never heard a woman say this conversation irrelevant.</v>

28
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.690
Ooh, Jesus, 17 minutes. I felt like an hour and a half.

29
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.040
I'm going to follow that. Oh man, you could do it.

30
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.730
[inaudible] it looked like a, keep a box cutter on you. So don't hurt me.

31
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.760
Appreciate the boom.

32
00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.720
[inaudible] Oh, really? So you look at my

33
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.020
[inaudible] guy, right? Like the money

34
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.850
I have no money. We would not get along.

35
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.800
[inaudible].

36
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.250
<v 1>It's sad that like comics are like drug addicts where you need those extremes</v>

37
00:03:32.251 --> 00:03:36.900
just to feel good. You know? Like you need that, that, that hit.

38
00:03:36.901 --> 00:03:41.190
You need that fix. I mean, I buy a new iPad or I get,

39
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.020
I get a BJ after a show. Like that's all in fun and games, but it's not enough.

40
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.550
You need that, that rush. That, that crowd, you need everything.

41
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.010
How sad is that? That it to be happy. I need all,

42
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.490
all those factors have to happen in a comedy club and audience has to show up.

43
00:03:56.491 --> 00:03:59.520
Somebody has to, I want a comedy clubs. I'm used to by a microphone, by a light.

44
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.060
Somebody has to allow you to perform there and you have to do well,

45
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.620
all those things have to go on just for us to be happy. And if we get heckled,

46
00:04:07.621 --> 00:04:12.090
it's all ruined. We're selfish, terrible, um,

47
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.100
misunderstood people. Well, we're going to go beat up a bunch of cops.

48
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.410
You should come with, you know,

49
00:04:16.411 --> 00:04:19.950
the feeling of taking a cop's gun and turning it on him. It's a great feeling.

50
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.770
How do you feel about the Jews? Which what's that mean?

51
00:04:22.771 --> 00:04:25.770
What does that word mean? That's what this protest is about. Right?

52
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.790
All right. Well, what do you, what do you look for in a man.

53
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.450
<v 3>Really? Is that what's going on? I have a boyfriend.</v>

54
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.270
<v 1>Do you? I'm I'm protesting against that.</v>

55
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.380
<v 3>Welcome back to a new day in Cleveland. It is time for a little bit.</v>

56
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.950
<v 1>Beautiful.</v>

57
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.100
<v 3>So welcome here into the engine. The studio. It's good to have you here.</v>

58
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.080
<v 1>It's a, it's a pleasure. I'm a little hung over a little gay, but uh,</v>

59
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.350
just glad to be here with you sister.

60
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.630
<v 3>Oh, I appreciate you saying that.</v>

61
00:04:57.631 --> 00:05:00.600
I'm very happy to be here with you to my erection. Okay.

62
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.150
<v 1>But uh, been farting it up in the green room.</v>

63
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.930
<v 3>Is that a guy thing you would hear?</v>

64
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.330
No woman would ever say something like that.

65
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.320
<v 1>No more. Maybe a quirky thing. Oh my gosh.</v>

66
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.830
<v 3>Claimed TV. I mean, you know, you live,</v>

67
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.380
you live in New York city now, but you're from new Orleans.

68
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.280
<v 1>Yeah. Wow. Well done. You're running a grinder by him.</v>

69
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.070
<v 3>I was looking you up. Yes.</v>

70
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.230
<v 1>Hey, that's why I'm a comedian because I got to get love somewhere. Sorry.</v>

71
00:05:34.231 --> 00:05:36.510
Is that a me too? All right.

72
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.790
<v 3>I can handle it. So, but we're big. I mean, you're young.</v>

73
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.350
So getting into this business and getting into this business

74
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.170
and um.

75
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.800
<v 1>35, 35, not that young, but uh, you know, not on the Viagra yet.</v>

76
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.320
Or am I, who knows comedians?

77
00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.430
We're our own breed. We're a weird group. You know, we're like, uh, we're weird.

78
00:06:06.431 --> 00:06:10.810
We're inappropriate, we're awkward. And we're offensive.

79
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.990
Like we have comics really have no nerve endings when it comes to swastika,

80
00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:20.080
swastikas, abortions, AIDS, and STDs talk. But, uh,

81
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.860
I only hang out with comics really, which is probably unhealthy. But, uh,

82
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.850
that's the only people I feel like I can relate to and get along with.

83
00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.610
That's why comedy is great. It's it's like, you're saying, Hey,

84
00:06:30.611 --> 00:06:32.650
I've got these fun ideas. I think you'll enjoy it,

85
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.860
but don't interrupt me and don't ask anything of me I'll hit.

86
00:06:35.861 --> 00:06:39.310
This is what I can give you. Comics were terrible. Socially.

87
00:06:39.311 --> 00:06:43.480
Usually not good with around other people, but we still have something to say,

88
00:06:43.481 --> 00:06:47.230
we still have some talent to give. So we need to just let us give it out.

89
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.980
You watch and then we'll leave. We can interact interacting. I'm not good at,

90
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.310
but I still have something to offer verbally.

91
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.380
I think a day job for a comedian is much harder because we're wired differently.

92
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:03.940
So it's more, it takes more mental energy to be normal.

93
00:07:03.941 --> 00:07:06.790
Like you mortals, you know, it's tough. Not you,

94
00:07:06.791 --> 00:07:09.190
but everybody eating at this restaurant.

95
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.430
If I had a meaningful conversation with them,

96
00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:15.490
I think a lot of them would walk away just like that. Guy's wacky.

97
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.880
That guy has got some issues. He's a little dark. Maybe I am done.

98
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.590
And don't worry. I'm not cheating here. These just as I've drawn, here you go.

99
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.720
Where do we begin? I man, we've got to address the elephant and the anal Corona.

100
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.710
It's a bits of. We all, we're all sick of it. That's why we're here. You know,

101
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.550
Karen has been so long. It feels like the check engine light, you know,

102
00:07:36.551 --> 00:07:38.800
at first you're scared of it. Then after a while, you're like, it.

103
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:43.540
I gotta go to work. Any Jews here. Hey, go.

104
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:47.950
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

105
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:49.810
<v 1>Either. There are no Jews here. Or Jews are like,</v>

106
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:50.980
I'm not falling for that one again.

107
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.060
I wasn't getting a hand job at the moment in the car. Oh, that guy. All right.

108
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.830
Well done, sir. I didn't know. The hand job was still around Dominick.

109
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.600
I liked the cars that you can't tell who hates me. Ah. That car back down.

110
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.100
If you really care about it and are passionate and go for it and want it,

111
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.100
I think you'll get there. So the other thing that would work,

112
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.770
how much luck is involved in this process,

113
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.070
look has a punch for sure luck does,

114
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.530
but you can't control that and you can't worry about it.

115
00:08:20.531 --> 00:08:23.290
You just got to focus on you writing and working and busting your.

116
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.130
You gotta make your own luck in a way, the hustle and man,

117
00:08:27.131 --> 00:08:31.330
just going to work every day, uh, you know, beat tired.

118
00:08:31.331 --> 00:08:35.650
I'm eyes were red. I'd go to bed at like four or 5:00 AM. I'd wake up at eight,

119
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.290
go to work and then go do shows, write new material,

120
00:08:38.291 --> 00:08:42.520
get that clean five minutes, boom, audition, hear bang, bang, bang,

121
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:44.343
TV spot.

122
00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.800
<v 2>I got, I just put a special out to all my materials gone.</v>

123
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.620
It'd be one thing that I could come back on stage is jumping in my old act,

124
00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.800
but I just put out an act. I put out on YouTube. It's all out there.

125
00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:14.870
So now I got no material and no skills. Hopefully there's a crowd tonight.

126
00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:19.460
And uh, yeah, we'll, we'll yuck it up and really offend somebody.

127
00:09:19.461 --> 00:09:24.050
But it's sold out. Is it sold out? I didn't know that.

128
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.280
Oh my God.

129
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.610
So that was fun. I got a lot of work done, tried some new jokes, boy,

130
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:34.280
it was great. Uh, just a tough time.

131
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:38.270
New special came out and I'm rusty and I'm doing new material.

132
00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.500
So I'm all over the road. But, uh, that was great. Crowds were great.

133
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.920
I loved Texas and now I gotta fly back to New York.

134
00:09:45.921 --> 00:09:49.100
So when I hit the bar and drank with the staff and the local comics.

135
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:16.700
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>
