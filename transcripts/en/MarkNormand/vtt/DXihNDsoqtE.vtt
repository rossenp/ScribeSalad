00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.370
<v 0>Having said that let's make some noise for your headliner.</v>

2
00:00:02.371 --> 00:00:06.300
The guy who came to see, are you guys ready? Yes, let's get it going.

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.720
You seen him on cone and he's seen him tonight. Show Netflix all over. Please.

4
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.210
Welcome stage. Very funny, Mr. Mark Norman.

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.430
<v 1>Hey comedy. Huh?</v>

6
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.910
We're really doing it. Oh boy. This is wild.

7
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.010
I've been off 86 days now. I'm back and uh,

8
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.600
I don't know how I ever did this. This is terrifying.

9
00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:33.170
I just got nothing but swastikas here, so I don't know what to do, but, uh,

10
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.960
just to Canadian, tell him jokes. Bear with me folks. Uh,

11
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.550
I am rusty. Uh, I'm nervous, but we're going to have fun. You know,

12
00:00:43.551 --> 00:00:46.370
it's been a, it's been a while, but we'll be, there'll be bad. All right.

13
00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:50.420
All right, me take it easy. That's nice. Built a little, make a wishy, but I'm

14
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.500
good to be here. And then the Dallas, what a town, huh? It's hot, hot, fun,

15
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.500
fun. I might not. I'm coming from New York, you know? Um,

16
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.090
my whole cities of garbage fire right now. Uh,

17
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.350
it's the epicenter of Corona. We got riots and feels like the sixties,

18
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.820
race riots.

19
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.840
We just went to space and the president has a headshot.

20
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.250
It feels weird to do in Dallas, but um,

21
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.570
yeah, I know it used to be cool to be from New York.

22
00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:28.070
Like, I'd go to cities. They were like,

23
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.440
thanks for coming here from New York all the way now people are like,

24
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.260
thanks for, uh, you know, getting my grandma's sick. Your piece of garbage,

25
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.350
but we'll have fun. A lot of jokes, a lot of. Bear with me.

26
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.950
There's a lot of crap here, but you guys are living the good life. You know,

27
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.620
everything's locked up in New York. I went to a restaurant today.

28
00:01:45.621 --> 00:01:50.060
I feel like an Amish guy. I'm like, Whoa, lights. Look at this. Holy.

29
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.420
Uh, I got my hair cut in the backyard last week. I'm a, I'm a mess. All right.

30
00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.410
How you doing? Hey, you look familiar. Eh, all right. Um,

31
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.110
that's always a bad sign when I know every one of my fans by face.

32
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.810
Alright cool. Yeah. All right, here we go. Corona jokes. What,

33
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.200
what a time we're living in. I, I hope we get the antibody test. I don't know.

34
00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:18.680
Who knows. You know, it was probably immune to this is a, the two girls,

35
00:02:18.681 --> 00:02:23.090
one cup chicks. I feel like, uh, I feel like they're going to be fine. You know,

36
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.770
those girls can take a licking. Um, ah,

37
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.180
just so I'm rusty in every way. I'm out of shape. You guys have gyms yet.

38
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.490
Are those open? Wow.

39
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.110
You guys are bananas. Holy hell. Good for you. Yeah.

40
00:02:39.111 --> 00:02:40.940
You got the gym. Why don't we don't have any gyms up there.

41
00:02:40.941 --> 00:02:45.740
I'm all mushy and gay, you know, I'm uh, yeah,

42
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.280
I am out of shape. I haven't been this out of shape since, uh,

43
00:02:49.281 --> 00:02:53.870
the gyms were open, you know, uh, things are tough. Yeah. But I mean,

44
00:02:53.871 --> 00:02:57.320
it's business as usual, I'm paying for a gym membership and not going.

45
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.090
So nothing's really that different, but uh, yeah, working on it,

46
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.670
you gotta wear your mask. Now everybody's got the mask. Let's be honest.

47
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:07.870
Some people need a muzzle. Jesus Christ. Yet the hell up, stop yelling at me.

48
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.470
You know, Corona is so weird. It's like a horror movie. Like, ah,

49
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.590
if you're out at the Ozarks at the pool, you're evil. You're going to get it.

50
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:17.920
But if you're protesting, you'll be all right. Like what's the difference?

51
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.740
It's like the disease knows you're doing good or not. You know,

52
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.980
it's all very cookie. And now we're just sitting at home,

53
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:26.650
watching Netflix for six months, you know? Like, everybody's like,

54
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:31.090
what are you watching? I'm watching my life. Pass me by. Die in here.

55
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.430
Brutal. Everything's weird. Now our strip clubs open here.

56
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.210
Really? So do the chicks have no clothes on,

57
00:03:40.211 --> 00:03:44.320
but are wearing a mask that seems weird. Like, Hey, here's a sloppy 20.

58
00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:47.380
I'll put my nose in your butt hole, but don't cough on me. What are you crazy?

59
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.780
Everything's backwards.

60
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.050
But I'm lucky to be here. This is a great gig is a great club. And uh,

61
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.170
next week I'm playing a target Minneapolis. So, uh,

62
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.990
that could go either way, you know? Yeah. So thanks for having me. Um,

63
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.070
people are getting angry. This is everybody's pent up. Everybody's worked up,

64
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.520
you know, some people are mad at Asian people. Asian people love the riots.

65
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:17.330
They're like, woo. It's off us for a minute. You, Jesus Christ. Yeah.

66
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.650
I saw a bunch of people online are saying racist to Asian people. I'm like,

67
00:04:20.651 --> 00:04:23.290
look, if you're going to type a bunch of race and to Asian people,

68
00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:24.640
don't do it from an iPhone. All right.

69
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:26.290
Have some respect for the kid who made it.

70
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.180
All right. Oh, that's going to get a lot worse.

71
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.850
Um, buckle up books, all words. We're all gonna die. One day. Woo.

72
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.110
I mean, this is a tough time in history for black people.

73
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:45.070
Black people are going through it.

74
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.250
The two people have a tough right now where black people and women named Karen,

75
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.120
they were having a tough go. Um, but yeah. Yeah.

76
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.540
Bore black women there they're there. Yeah. They got hit hard by the disease.

77
00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:58.870
You know, which I'm shocked by because black blue is so strong. I'm surprised.

78
00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:01.360
I thought they'd be fine with illness. I mean, look at magic Johnson.

79
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.350
He's still kicking. Right. He's doing great. Hell he beat Coby.

80
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.903
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

81
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.820
<v 1>I know who saw that coming.</v>

82
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.430
Yeah. You got to live life folks. Yeah.

83
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.870
I know. Uh, black people are getting sick.

84
00:05:24.871 --> 00:05:28.380
I blame institutionalized racism and elaborate handshakes. Come on.

85
00:05:28.381 --> 00:05:32.670
Those things, uh, all this that had to catch up at some point, you know?

86
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.480
Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

87
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.070
I felt horrible. And I saw what happened in Minneapolis, the REITs out there.

88
00:05:41.071 --> 00:05:43.800
I got be, I didn't know. There were black people in Minnesota. I had no idea.

89
00:05:43.801 --> 00:05:47.910
I've been, I've been there like 10 times I've ever seen one black person. Um,

90
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.670
but you know, everybody wanted their business reopened. Well,

91
00:05:50.671 --> 00:05:53.760
the looters did that. They just did it through the glass, you know, but uh,

92
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.070
they were open. Hey, here we.

93
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.903
<v 2>Go.</v>

94
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.560
<v 1>Uh huh. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

95
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.390
Fun times. Weird times. You know,

96
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.740
they interviewed R Kelly about it and he was like, COVID-19 too old for me.

97
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.390
But um, yeah. Uh, boy, I hate myself.

98
00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.090
Uh, I don't know what's going on. The whole country is nuts.

99
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.630
Jimmy Fallon got in trouble for blackface. Like, like what are we doing?

100
00:06:25.631 --> 00:06:29.170
That was 20 years ago. Why are we mad at Jimmy found the TV show, put it out,

101
00:06:29.171 --> 00:06:32.470
NBC approved it. There was a writers' room. Why is it was 20 years ago?

102
00:06:32.471 --> 00:06:35.020
You know what I was doing 20 years ago, I was banging a 16 year old.

103
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:41.080
You can't judge stuff. By the later date, I was, I was also 16,

104
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:46.090
20 years ago. If you didn't don't call the police or blog or whatever.

105
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.940
Right. I think we're all sick of this though. We're all. I mean,

106
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.590
Corona is kind of like the check engine light, you know,

107
00:06:53.591 --> 00:06:55.720
when you first hear about it, you're like, this is terrifying.

108
00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.370
Then after a while you're like, I gotta get to work.

109
00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:02.650
<v 2>This is too much. Yeah.</v>

110
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.580
<v 1>Some people didn't buy it though. My uncle, he looks at Corona,</v>

111
00:07:06.581 --> 00:07:08.950
like it's the tooth. Fairy's like, I know this is all made up,

112
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.060
but I'll take the free money.

113
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.460
<v 2>Mm mm mm.</v>

114
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.040
<v 1>It's a crazy country. We live in, you know, eventually all this will be over,</v>

115
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.890
you know, it's something to look forward to. Eventually this will all be over.

116
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:25.840
You know, the pandemic will end.

117
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.980
The police brutality will end and then we'll be right back to school shootings.

118
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.720
You know what a, what a nation,

119
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.020
these poor kids that got to go to school at home.

120
00:07:38.021 --> 00:07:40.240
Now they've got to have homeschooling every kid.

121
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:44.020
How long till a teacher in Florida one of her students. Ah.

122
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:46.720
<v 2>Cybersex.</v>

123
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.020
<v 1>Though cyber sex. Oh, I that up.</v>

124
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.200
I thought you guys would be wearing masks. This is nice to see, you know,

125
00:07:53.201 --> 00:07:55.000
there's so many masses. I hate the mask. I can't,

126
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.070
I can't tell which women need to be smiling. Yeah.

127
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:00.160
<v 2>Okay.</v>

128
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.180
<v 1>Oh right. Yeah. Things have gotten crazy.</v>

129
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.090
And then we got a big election coming up, big election coming up. Uh,

130
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.210
I think I'm going to vote for Biden, but I don't know anything about the guy.

131
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.690
All I know is it feels like the guy's running an entire presidential campaign on

132
00:08:13.691 --> 00:08:14.890
having a cool black friend.

133
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.750
It seems like all I know about him and he was like kind of a creepo old dude,

134
00:08:19.751 --> 00:08:21.540
you know, if he's wearing a mask,

135
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:26.140
how's he going to smell those little girl's hair? How's that going to work out?

136
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:31.390
Louis CK donate a bunch of money to Biden and Biden said, no, thanks.

137
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:36.010
I was like, what? He's like, he's a creep. Like, yeah. But so are you,

138
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:40.780
You're not going to take his money. What about you? Huh?

139
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.200
That's like Chris Brown going. I can't watch MMA. You know? That's great. Yeah.

140
00:08:44.201 --> 00:08:47.290
I can't do it. Yeah. It's too bad. That's violent, you know?

141
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:48.573
<v 2>Mm.</v>

142
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:55.150
<v 1>Yeah. Joe Biden. What a kook. I can't wait till he meets Greta Thornburgh.</v>

143
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.920
Can we get those two together? You know, have him creep out on her. You know,

144
00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:01.710
he hugs her for too long. He's like, is it global warming or is it hot in here?

145
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.710
Uh she's like, how dare you?

146
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:12.620
Alright. I think we've had enough of that. Um, Ooh, baby doll.

147
00:09:12.621 --> 00:09:17.620
That was a, it comes right back. I mean 85 plus days out,

148
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:22.250
whatever it's been. It just, I was nervous and it's like a,

149
00:09:22.251 --> 00:09:24.740
I hate to use the old cliche. It's like riding a bike.

150
00:09:24.741 --> 00:09:26.930
You just get up there and you're like, Oh, peddling again.

151
00:09:26.931 --> 00:09:29.600
And then you noticed like, Oh, I'm doing it. And then you get scared.

152
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.610
Then you just go, Hey, don't even think about it. And just,

153
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:35.360
just sit back in the water. I would never have taken that much time off.

154
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:38.090
I was forced to take time off as we all are.

155
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:42.620
And it may make you appreciate, I do this every weekend. Hey,

156
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.570
we became like autopilot.

157
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:48.170
And then to go back up there after 80 days and be like, Oh my God,

158
00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:49.760
this is so amazing. What I'm doing.

159
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:54.140
I wrote this and they're laughing and it's flowing and the lights and the crowd

160
00:09:54.141 --> 00:09:58.430
and beautiful thing. I'm getting sappy and queasy up here. But, uh,

161
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.440
it's going to be bad. Yeah.
