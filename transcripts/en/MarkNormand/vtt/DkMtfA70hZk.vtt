1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.230
<v 0>She's opening for Amy Schumer. Yeah, it should be fun. Great gig.</v>

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.750
How much time do you do every night? About 20.

3
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.380
<v 1>So you're flying first class taking choppers to gigs for 20 minutes that.</v>

4
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.730
<v 0>Feel money's great. The hotels are great. Five star hotels, generous, loyal,</v>

5
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.450
giver. All these. She gets so much hate these people. She's a great gal.

6
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.820
I don't know what they're talking about.

7
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.100
Traveling with her and staying in five star hotels. That's a good point.

8
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.240
<v 1>But Amy's always been a very generous and very cool. So, uh,</v>

9
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.593
but what is the,

10
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.190
do you even feel like you're working if you're only doing 20 minutes.

11
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.120
<v 0>And you're back the same night and he just made a ton of dough and you got to do</v>

12
00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:41.090
the thing you love and be pampered. I mean, I hate to be that guy,

13
00:00:41.091 --> 00:00:44.390
but it's great. The hotel and I wouldn't want to be her.

14
00:00:44.391 --> 00:00:45.590
I wouldn't want to be the headliner.

15
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.170
It's even better because I get to just open and then I'm done.

16
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.870
<v 1>Just having drinks and flirting with chicks.</v>

17
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.290
<v 0>That's it? Yeah. Am I going to BJ in the back? I mean, if Kenny's available,</v>

18
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.760
but uh, yeah, it's just, it's the dream. It's late. A lot of her shows,

19
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.440
Oh my dude. It's 10 million or 10,000 people and me going, Oh, I'm single. Huh?

20
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.880
Yeah. So it's, it's open game on the Tinder. Is there any,

21
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.260
it's always a subtle thing that comics do. Like I'm a single or, uh, yeah.

22
00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:16.060
You know, I love cocaine or it's hard to lug in this wide car.

23
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:17.301
<v 1>Say no, no.</v>

24
00:01:17.301 --> 00:01:20.330
I was just going to ask him if there's any guilt associated with the fact that

25
00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:21.380
you don't feel like you're really worried.

26
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.670
<v 0>Oh, of course. I got crazy guilt. I have guilt when Roland gets me a sandwich.</v>

27
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.500
So yeah, I'm a guilt ridden nutjob, but I just trying to be about that.

28
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.260
I have guilt issues. I have real bad guilt,

29
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.990
but how long have you been doing stand-up? 10 years. 10 years.

30
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.640
You're making money. You're traveling.

31
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.540
<v 1>I think this is a normal thing. That's why I asked him not asking me. Cause he,</v>

32
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.250
I feel like he's damaged or something,

33
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.540
but I would think that if you're flying first class staying in the best hotels,

34
00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:50.360
I also know she's very generous with taking you guys out to eat.

35
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.680
I know everything about this. Yeah.

36
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.850
And then you're literally on stage for 20 minutes. I, I would almost,

37
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.350
I think I would feel that guilt.

38
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.480
<v 0>Total guilt. And like, if you don't do well, Oh my God. Talk about guilt.</v>

39
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.710
You feel horrible. Don't do well. Is it because the crowd wants to see Amy?

40
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.870
Yeah. Usually, or, you know, maybe you're off.

41
00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:11.900
Maybe you're nervous and you can't get the jokes out. Right. The timing's off.

42
00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:15.290
But yeah. I mean, if you bomb, I bombed one or two times in a,

43
00:02:15.291 --> 00:02:17.510
in a theater and it is by the way,

44
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.160
bombing is hard to bombing in front of 10,000 is brutal. That's a loud silence.

45
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.350
Uh, but yeah, I mean, I feel guilty.

46
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.940
I'll I have these weird issues where I think my parents were kind of up and

47
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.090
they, they screwed me up. But uh,

48
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.970
I'll I love smoothies and I'll walk by a smoothie place and I'm like, God,

49
00:02:31.971 --> 00:02:33.890
you got a smoothie. I'm like, well, what the do you think you are?

50
00:02:33.891 --> 00:02:37.760
Just to be able to get a smoothie and I'll just walk right by it.

51
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.010
I'm an idiot. I don't know. It's weird. I won't eat certain things. I'm like,

52
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.980
I'm looking at cookies. Know what do you think? You just deserve a cookie. you,

53
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.980
you piece of before in my life. What is that? Based on?

54
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.790
I think my parents didn't give anything. We had no food in the house as a kid.

55
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.850
And, and you know, either all by you gotta earn, you've got to work hard.

56
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:56.803
I don't know where.

57
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.250
<v 1>I didn't have a lot of food in the house.</v>

58
00:02:58.251 --> 00:03:01.330
So now I make sure if I want a smoothie, I'm getting a gods.

59
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.650
<v 0>You're healthy. I, uh, I got problems. I don't know what.</v>

60
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.570
<v 1>Current issues also have issues. Jesus. Yeah.</v>

61
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.530
We got something it's hard to get to where he's at so he can appreciate what you

62
00:03:13.531 --> 00:03:14.880
guys have worked hard to get where you're at.

63
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.020
<v 0>But you know these guys, you just see them walking into a basket Robbins.</v>

64
00:03:18.021 --> 00:03:20.880
You're like, what the did you get promoted? No. Then get the hell out of here.

65
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.080
You don't deserve that. Where are you walking around? Starving all the time.

66
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.740
I am a hungry. That's why I'm so thin. When do you treat yourself? Ah,

67
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.020
when I'm hammered. I usually do. Oh well cause then,

68
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.310
cause the inhibitions are all gone, you know? And then he'd just eat food. I.

69
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.750
Just anything. I Kia furniture size women. I mean,

70
00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:41.250
it's crazy.

71
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.730
<v 1>Wait, I know we've got a break, but you're in a, you're in a city.</v>

72
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.050
You just had a good show.

73
00:03:46.051 --> 00:03:48.600
Now you're walking around a cool area that has like smoothie shots.

74
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.530
<v 0>Yes. You're staying in the nice part too. Where do do you go into.</v>

75
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.750
<v 1>Any of these places? Because you're just simply hungry.</v>

76
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.000
<v 0>Isn't it now. And I, you know, I'm like, Oh,</v>

77
00:03:57.001 --> 00:04:00.360
there's a mint on the pillow at the hotel. Eat that that's free, you know? Oh,

78
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.720
there's a roll on that dead food service tray on the floor. I'll get that.

79
00:04:03.721 --> 00:04:07.470
This is real. Oh, but mess. You can ask my friends. They've all seen it.

80
00:04:07.471 --> 00:04:09.930
They're like, dude, like I'll be with Joe list. I'll be like,

81
00:04:09.931 --> 00:04:11.790
I'm going to get a dollar slice. He's like, dude, you make good money,

82
00:04:11.791 --> 00:04:14.550
go get a Joe's slice. I'm like, nah, I gotta get the dollar.

83
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.380
But we went and had nice burgers in the Austin you paid is that was a

84
00:04:19.381 --> 00:04:22.860
funny thing. It's like, who am I to just give this guy a piece of paper?

85
00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:24.510
And then I get a burger. Get the hell out.

86
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.530
When you hook up with any of Amy's fans. Yes.

87
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.560
Do you ever feel guilty because they're her fans and you them.

88
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.140
Not because they're her fans. They still chose to me.

89
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.070
And I think it's a money thing. It's a money and food thing really.

90
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.170
<v 1>But I think also, uh, you know,</v>

91
00:04:43.171 --> 00:04:47.070
some of the Amy fans become Mark Norman fans to cross over there.

92
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.070
<v 0>Should I just got a new apartment and I have no furniture in it. Cause I'm like,</v>

93
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.160
I don't deserve, I'll look at like a nice couch.

94
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.640
I'm like this couch is not for me. That's big nugget, Lucy. Kay.

95
00:04:56.641 --> 00:04:58.980
Bought me a watch after the gigs. You know?

96
00:04:58.981 --> 00:04:59.940
I don't know if I'm supposed to say that,

97
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.600
but he bought me a really nice watch and I can't wear it because it's too nice.

98
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.360
So I just, it's kind of a waste. I'm walking around my apartment,

99
00:05:06.361 --> 00:05:08.820
my underwear with a watch. I'm looking in the mirror going, Hey, look at this.

100
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.720
<v 1>So do you feel like eventually you'll be able to wear the watch and go to the</v>

101
00:05:12.721 --> 00:05:17.460
smoothie shop? Like [inaudible] Like, do you feel like, all right,

102
00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:22.140
maybe if I get a sitcom or a movie or is there some kind of goal

103
00:05:22.141 --> 00:05:24.500
in your mind where you go now I'll be able to.

104
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.850
<v 0>Treat myself. I think if I get a sitcom,</v>

105
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.240
I'll buy myself a smoothie and that'll be my reward. And then it's back to hell.

106
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.160
Holy. Do you talk to anyone about this? I got a therapist. Wow.

107
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.520
How often do you see your therapist? Once a week. Yeah. Great guy.

108
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.810
He thinks he's like, just buy the smoothie. You earned it. He's like he can't,

109
00:05:42.811 --> 00:05:44.400
he's got all this. Like you don't love yourself.

110
00:05:44.401 --> 00:05:46.680
What's the point who's no one else is going to buy is really well. You know?

111
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.040
Where does your therapist think it comes from? Uh, he thinks it's all parents,

112
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.460
but how about this Schumer? This is years ago.

113
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.970
I broke up my girlfriend and I gave her my apartments. I was like, you take it.

114
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.300
I just want to be away from you. So you take the apartment,

115
00:05:59.301 --> 00:06:00.140
I'll find a new apartment.

116
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.510
I left a bunch of over there and it was such a bad breakup.

117
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.750
I couldn't go back over there. And she had my coat. It's dead of winter.

118
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:08.120
It's like January, 2014.

119
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.660
She bought me a coat because I was just walking around in like a hoodie in the

120
00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:14.000
middle of winter. And she was like, what are you doing? I'm freezing my balls.

121
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.590
I'm like, I don't have a coach. He's like, where's your coat? I'm like,

122
00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:17.780
I left at my girlfriend's house. Why don't you go get it? I can't face her.

123
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.080
Well, why don't you go buy one? I can't buy a coat. It's too much money.

124
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:24.050
I don't deserve that. And she bought me one. You wouldn't buy a coat.

125
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.700
That Patagonia coat she paid for. And that's now three years old. Yeah.

126
00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:32.150
That's a weird thing though, because you can afford a click and afford.

127
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.510
There's a difference. Yeah. There's a difference between like,

128
00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:37.550
I don't want this watch because it's too nice for me.

129
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.950
I don't want to eat this because I feel like that's kind of like something you

130
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:42.590
should do. If you're, if you're more successful, when you're cold,

131
00:06:42.591 --> 00:06:45.980
you need a coat. Ah, dovetail. Tell me about it. I was freezing,

132
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.210
but how do you justify that in your head that you don't buy yours?

133
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.070
Cause I'm like, who am I to get a coat? I'm not a fun guy.

134
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.610
I'm not a buyer. I can't walk into a store. Buy a coat is a privilege.

135
00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:59.410
Yes.

136
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.130
<v 1>I think no matter who you are and how much money you make, we're all coping.</v>

137
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.060
<v 0>Guys. Yeah. Every once in a while it's like, everyone's a Coke guy.</v>

138
00:07:07.061 --> 00:07:11.170
Everyone is a shoes. Guy has shoes, everybody. Well, look,

139
00:07:11.171 --> 00:07:14.440
I got the square shoes on the planet because there's a new balance.

140
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:15.550
That's your thing. All right.

141
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.420
Are you to have new balance Slack kick out and buy these Jordans.

142
00:07:19.421 --> 00:07:20.290
These kids are wearing.

143
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.880
<v 1>I'm going to blow your mind. Why was it okay to take the coat from Amy?</v>

144
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.230
<v 0>I think it was a gift. So if it's a gift that's okay. I guess.</v>

145
00:07:29.231 --> 00:07:32.680
So it doesn't make sense. So have your friends at the smoothie store go,

146
00:07:32.681 --> 00:07:37.300
here's a gift for you today? Well, they don't speak English, but Hey,

147
00:07:37.301 --> 00:07:39.430
I thought we were going to break. No, this is,

148
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.160
this is way better than anything else. It's fascinating.

149
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.330
It's really fascinating.

150
00:07:43.331 --> 00:07:47.320
So he was okay with you buying him the burgers in Austin.

151
00:07:47.321 --> 00:07:51.820
He's okay with Amy buying him this nice coat. You hide it though, man?

152
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:52.710
Yeah.

153
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:53.920
<v 1>I didn't know anything about, I mean,</v>

154
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.870
we've hung out a little bit here and there socially.

155
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.080
You hide this stuff because it looks like you're dressed. Nice. And.

156
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:01.630
<v 0>I got this shirt for doing Colbert. It's a free t-shirt.</v>

157
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.930
<v 1>Well, I mean, I'm not just talking about today's shirt in general. I would,</v>

158
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.850
I would assume you, you shop for yourself.

159
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.500
<v 0>Yeah. You don't look like a guy who's trying to save money. Oh, that's good.</v>

160
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.390
<v 1>How many pair of jeans do you have to?</v>

161
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.670
<v 0>And I basically only wear this one, the other one's like my lawn mow and jeans,</v>

162
00:08:18.671 --> 00:08:21.070
you know? And that's it. And that's it. Yeah.

163
00:08:21.071 --> 00:08:25.300
What do you need more than two for minimalist? I'm a minimalist in general,

164
00:08:25.301 --> 00:08:27.040
but I got one pair of shoes.

165
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:29.230
<v 1>A couple of shirts and we got a couple pairs of jacket.</v>

166
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.370
I'm almost there with you. I mean, we didn't have a lot of money growing up.

167
00:08:33.371 --> 00:08:36.730
So I, there is some guilt with me, but not to that extent.

168
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.850
I'm going to buy myself a smoothie every time.

169
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.690
<v 0>And if I get that smoothie, the guilt it all day long, like what the?</v>

170
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.260
Who do you think you are, you know, money bags, your piece of.

171
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.120
What are you getting a smoothie? What if you run out of money?

172
00:08:49.121 --> 00:08:51.430
What if you don't make it know? It's it never ends.

173
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:56.130
So I'd rather just not have it and go, you know, live a anxiety-free you lived.

174
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.530
<v 1>In that pretty awesome house down there in new Orleans. I mean,</v>

175
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.000
it seemed like your parents had money.

176
00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.110
<v 0>Well, that's the thing, this, this, this is where it all stems from.</v>

177
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:07.400
My dad bought a mansion, a dilapidated mansion in a poor black neighborhood.

178
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:11.420
So on the front it looks like we got money, but in the inside there's termites,

179
00:09:11.421 --> 00:09:14.030
rats, pigeons. We don't have running water.

180
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:18.740
So I kind of have this look of wealth, but it's all of a sudden,

181
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.550
you say, Hey, you don't look poor and I'm not poor, but you don't look balmy,

182
00:09:22.551 --> 00:09:25.520
but it's all, I'm a bum inside. Just like the house.

183
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:33.080
Yes. That's fascinating. Was deep. That's fascinating stuff. Oh yeah. I mean,

184
00:09:33.081 --> 00:09:34.850
we get robbed all the time and these guys would come and be like,

185
00:09:34.851 --> 00:09:37.400
where the is everything. Right? We were like, Hey, welcome to our world.

186
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.550
You know, like home invasions people would, Oh my God, we got robbed. You know,

187
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.490
once every three months, Jesus, it's frightening.

188
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.220
We were the white guys on the block with the mansion. So everybody's like, Hey,

189
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:47.180
we got to get in there.

190
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.870
<v 1>Did your parents ever think let's get the out of this name?</v>

191
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.910
<v 0>Well, they're so liberal and they're so progressive that, you know, my bike,</v>

192
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.030
we get stolen all the time. A couple of guys took my bike off of me once.

193
00:09:56.031 --> 00:09:59.150
And I was like, I ran home crying. I was like 10. And I was like, Oh,

194
00:09:59.151 --> 00:10:02.150
these guys stole my bike. And my mom's like, well, they need it. No,

195
00:10:02.151 --> 00:10:04.940
they need it more at all. Don't worry about it. We'll get you a new bike,

196
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:08.030
you know, whatever. And I was like, but I like that bike. Ah. I think.

197
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.980
<v 1>You just explain why you don't like talking politics.</v>

198
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:15.260
<v 0>No, I just don't. I, my brain goes off when I hear politics. Right. You know?</v>

199
00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:17.390
<v 1>Well, cause you it's all nonsense.</v>

200
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:21.890
And the [inaudible] side thinks their sides the best. And in the end,

201
00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.870
they're both. Both sides are.

202
00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.900
<v 0>Same with sports. I can't get into it. Cause I'm like, it's all just, okay.</v>

203
00:10:26.901 --> 00:10:29.300
A ball went to hoop who gives a, he got points. He didn't, I don't know.

204
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:33.110
None of it matters to me. Right. But I get why sports are great.

205
00:10:33.111 --> 00:10:34.760
And I get why politics are interesting. I just, it's not.

206
00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:38.630
<v 1>Has the therapist made any headway as far as you treating yourself to anything?</v>

207
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.800
<v 0>A little, but I push it down. I push it down. Like in what way?</v>

208
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.860
<v 2>Any kind of progress in being able to enjoy life like a normal person?</v>

209
00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.560
<v 0>Not much, but I'm aware of it, but like more aware of it. Yeah.</v>

210
00:10:51.561 --> 00:10:55.310
But here's one thing I do. I'll take girls out and I splurge.

211
00:10:55.340 --> 00:11:00.290
Big dinners drank really want y'all yeah. Hey, let's get a ride here.

212
00:11:00.291 --> 00:11:03.110
It's Uber's everywhere. Taxis everywhere. Let's get a nice hotel,

213
00:11:03.111 --> 00:11:06.830
big money because it's for her, not for me and that, that I can do.

214
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.130
<v 1>And you're taking it and you're reaping the rewards of it.</v>

215
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.790
<v 0>That I'm reaping the war and you can lay it and I'm on, on a date, you know,</v>

216
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.730
because have to buy a place. You bought a place, a lot of place. But I mean,

217
00:11:16.731 --> 00:11:19.190
I saved up for years and I just, I I'm only doing,

218
00:11:19.191 --> 00:11:21.050
I'm only able to do it cause it's such a good investment.

219
00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:21.913
That's what I keep telling him.

220
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:24.380
<v 1>That's what I was going to ask you because.</v>

221
00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.320
<v 0>You're going to get laid from the places.</v>

222
00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.920
<v 1>You gotta make money off it eventually. Yeah. But you can't buy furniture.</v>

223
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.850
I have no furniture. So what's in your house.

224
00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.880
<v 0>A mattress on the floor, like a assassin.</v>

225
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:37.820
<v 1>That kind of rules. No, I'm not even kidding.</v>

226
00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.970
<v 0>I mean, every girl that comes over, I'm like, I just moved in a week ago.</v>

227
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:46.610
You don't have a couch yet. Now I got no couch TV. I have a TV.

228
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:50.990
Cause there was one in the apartment when that one in the apartment. Yeah.

229
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:55.330
That's the only reason I wifi eventually. Cause I had work to do, you know,

230
00:11:55.331 --> 00:11:58.480
I had to like do work. So I had to get a. So that makes sense to you. Yeah.

231
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:03.430
We're not cable. I got cable, but I never watch it. I should watch it.

232
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.360
<v 1>But you're paying for cable. I'm paying for cable. You deserve, you buy.</v>

233
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:09.990
<v 0>Yeah. I don't buy groceries. I don't eat at home. You just get,</v>

234
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.020
take out or whatever. Yeah. A lot of eating out a lot of comedy club food,

235
00:12:13.021 --> 00:12:15.840
whatever. So the one thing you'll splurge on is women.

236
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.300
Have you been in a relationship long enough where you just stop?

237
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.770
Cause you're like, eh. Yeah.

238
00:12:19.771 --> 00:12:22.440
And I start to resent them with like this horse is running out my bank account

239
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.410
and then you break up with them because they're like, what's the problem. Like.

240
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.113
<v 1>They can.</v>

241
00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.350
And she's just trying to get toilet paper for your apartment.

242
00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:37.800
<v 0>[Inaudible] that is fascinating. I love this. We're getting too deep here.</v>

243
00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.640
If you don't mind, this is not don't mind, but I'm good.

244
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:45.000
I'm telling you right now. I don't want to bore anybody in Canada.

245
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.870
It's fascinating. It's weird that it kind of bothers you a little bit too.

246
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:50.790
Well it's it's a curse.

247
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:54.330
<v 1>Yeah. And I get, I get guilt to a certain extent,</v>

248
00:12:54.331 --> 00:12:58.560
but this is way further in your spending. You mean not? Yeah.

249
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:01.830
And just in general, like just talking but not.

250
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.020
<v 0>Not in what form is your guilt?</v>

251
00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.350
<v 1>Um, that's a good question. Let me think.</v>

252
00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:12.270
<v 0>I steal a lot too. Which is a problem when you're drunk,</v>

253
00:13:12.271 --> 00:13:14.010
you steal more when you're drunk. Tons of stealing.

254
00:13:14.011 --> 00:13:18.030
But I steal from like Walmart or Walgreens or I don't steal from like a person's

255
00:13:18.031 --> 00:13:21.390
house. Is that okay? Because I feel like that's a corporation. They're fine.

256
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:25.050
Pocket from Starbucks all the time. Do you see all the that you don't need?

257
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.910
That's always food or so I don't steal like, like a snow globe, you know?

258
00:13:29.911 --> 00:13:31.770
But I'll be at the airport. I'm like, Oh, these prices are crazy.

259
00:13:31.771 --> 00:13:36.060
I'll just steal a sandwich and they don't notice it. Oh, I'm the King. Yeah.

260
00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:38.980
While you're traveling with Amy, not really with Amy, be like,

261
00:13:38.981 --> 00:13:41.250
if I'm going to meet her and I'm flying somewhere to meet her. Yeah.

262
00:13:41.251 --> 00:13:42.420
I'll steal from the airport all the time.

263
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:45.630
What if I got popped here and I had to tell Amy, I got caught.

264
00:13:45.631 --> 00:13:48.030
I think about that all the time. Yeah. I'm so good.

265
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.560
<v 1>How have you been good?</v>

266
00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:53.460
<v 0>I mean, I got popped when I was like 11. I was stole a cause I was like,</v>

267
00:13:53.461 --> 00:13:54.810
what's a. You know,

268
00:13:54.811 --> 00:13:58.650
I knew it was like vaginal and I stole a from Rite aid and they caught me and

269
00:13:58.651 --> 00:14:00.570
they were like, what are you doing with this dude? I was like, my mom's sick.

270
00:14:00.571 --> 00:14:04.110
I made up this whole thing. The guys, I gotta get the hell out of here. No,

271
00:14:04.111 --> 00:14:06.600
I was trying to learn vaginally. You thought maybe you could it.

272
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.780
This is pre-Google. Yeah. Maybe a little. I thought it was last week.

273
00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.200
Yeah. Close to get.

274
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.990
He ever thought somebody was eyeballing you when you were stealing something and

275
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.660
thought Holy. In your heart. Yeah, of course. And then I aboard. I mean,

276
00:14:18.661 --> 00:14:20.610
I'm not dumb. I know when to pull out, you know.

277
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:25.110
<v 1>Lean a little bit to him. No, because if, if, uh,</v>

278
00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.560
I leave a store with something, I have no guilt. Cause I think the same thing.

279
00:14:28.561 --> 00:14:32.790
It's a corporation of these, but everything is over overpriced to begin.

280
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.980
We'll never know. They'll never know. them.

281
00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:37.110
It might get away with a little something every once in a while.

282
00:14:37.111 --> 00:14:38.130
I have no problem with it.

283
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.660
<v 0>No, nothing, none. That's why I like that. Winona Ryder. I totally get it. Yeah.</v>

284
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:43.890
I'm like, ah, it. Steel.

285
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.240
<v 1>Thrill. It's a thrill. It's a good time. So when you're eating out,</v>

286
00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:52.010
it has to be just basic stuff. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Totally.

287
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.900
<v 0>I mean, I go to Chipotle a lot. Just,</v>

288
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.830
just something that's like quick 10 bucks or less. And I'm full.

289
00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.570
<v 1>I love finding out like I hate topless and like that.</v>

290
00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:06.520
I love finding out why you guys are comics. I finally figured out Mark.

291
00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:11.350
He gave us this. We didn't, uh, I mean, it makes a lot of sense.

292
00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.480
<v 0>I don't even get these comics go up there and go, Hey, what the?</v>

293
00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.720
You don't laugh. Who gives a? you. It's like, no, make them laugh.

294
00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.270
That's your job. Your piece of. Make them laugh. Right.

295
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.360
I hate these lazy comics. They give us a bad name too. Right?

296
00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:25.090
I don't give you guys laugh and go to a park, yelled a pigeon.

297
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.580
Why are you in this comedy club? But this full audience, that page.

298
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:30.340
So that's why you work so hard. Yeah. That's a big part of it.

299
00:15:30.341 --> 00:15:32.410
Four or five sets a night. Guilt.

300
00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:34.630
<v 3>If people don't know, Mark works really hard.</v>

301
00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:38.590
<v 0>At this most sets in New York. Really? Oh yeah. It's been documented.</v>

302
00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.590
It's been done most sets in New York like in a night.

303
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:45.460
Like I think in a year span. I'll do like four nights. I did four last night.

304
00:15:45.461 --> 00:15:49.000
I did four on Tuesday. Wednesday. What happens if you do one or two?

305
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:52.420
I feel horrible. Horrible. I'm like, Oh, come on. What are you doing?

306
00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.900
I got the easiest job. Best job in the world. I can't do more than one set.

307
00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:56.763
Come on.

308
00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:59.050
<v 3>Only because you couldn't get booked for more shows.</v>

309
00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.600
<v 0>Yeah. Something will come up or you know, a show got canceled.</v>

310
00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:04.060
<v 1>Are you, are your parents proud of you?</v>

311
00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:08.200
<v 0>Maybe that's what I'm looking for. I mean, they're not mad at me.</v>

312
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:10.000
They're just like, yeah. You know, you're whatever you're doing your thing.

313
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.330
They're casual battery. Very casual. This is what my parents do.

314
00:16:13.331 --> 00:16:15.580
This is when my therapist goes in on and that we'll get out of here.

315
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.330
I'll go in my house. Are you calling the break? Well, I just feel bad.

316
00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:21.490
I'm hogging it here. So I go to my grades,

317
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:24.370
I go to my parents' house and they'll just be like, Hey, how you doing?

318
00:16:24.371 --> 00:16:27.220
Good to see it. And they'll drop a stack of magazines,

319
00:16:27.221 --> 00:16:29.590
newspapers and whatever on the table. And they go,

320
00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:33.700
those have comedy in mentioned in it and I go, Oh, all right.

321
00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.680
Because they know I like comedy. So they're like, yeah,

322
00:16:35.681 --> 00:16:37.240
that's mentioned in there. I'm like, okay,

323
00:16:37.241 --> 00:16:40.450
so now I don't want to be a Dick because they thought about me.

324
00:16:40.451 --> 00:16:44.710
So I sit there with a reading glasses on and a highlighter and I go through and

325
00:16:44.711 --> 00:16:47.680
I go, Oh, there's the comedy. Cause I want to make them feel good for caring.

326
00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.130
Even though they're not around.

327
00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.860
<v 3>Anymore to see that you're going to look at the articles.</v>

328
00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:58.270
<v 0>And they know that this is the least amount of care they can give.</v>

329
00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:02.740
But in their mind, I'm like, Hey, this is looking at, we give a. All right.

330
00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.850
<v 3>They don't care. Their care doesn't go like much deeper than, yeah.</v>

331
00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.670
<v 0>I don't think so. I mean, if I'm on call and they go, Hey, you're on call.</v>

332
00:17:09.671 --> 00:17:11.370
How cool is that? But they don't. I don't know if they're like.

333
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:15.850
<v 1>Final question. What do you think they did to that? That's such a nice room.</v>

334
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.850
<v 0>What was that trigger?</v>

335
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:22.630
<v 1>My mom just yelled and screamed all the time. It was exhausting.</v>

336
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.940
<v 3>To what you do today. I.</v>

337
00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:29.870
<v 1>Used to be a yeller and screamer. Most interested, not, not so much in, uh, um,</v>

338
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.943
uh, many years now.

339
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.580
<v 3>To be honest. Is that part of why you went to therapy? Uh,</v>

340
00:17:33.581 --> 00:17:35.830
I went to therapy cause yeah, between, you know.

341
00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:40.150
<v 1>The new life with my wife and kids and all that I finally was like, all right.</v>

342
00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:43.330
I always thought that therapy who needs that. That's great.

343
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.360
But then you realize, Oh no, this is actually good. And could really help you.

344
00:17:46.361 --> 00:17:46.630
So.

345
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:50.040
<v 0>It sounds like you cured your, so your got you cured. I feel like I'm in.</v>

346
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:54.090
<v 1>A good place. I don't know. I mean, I think everyone could, could use, um,</v>

347
00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:59.550
someone to talk to and you know, I checked in from time to time, but yeah,

348
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.820
there was a lot of awareness that came just talking to somebody. Totally.

349
00:18:02.821 --> 00:18:03.654
And that's the first step.

350
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:07.370
<v 3>Has ever had a therapy session that, uh, turned into a breakdown.</v>

351
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:10.700
<v 0>Few of them I've had that</v>

352
00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:17.750
[inaudible] as a joke, Steve McQueen.

353
00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.520
<v 1>That it was time to move on. And my therapist actually said,</v>

354
00:18:22.521 --> 00:18:23.510
you're good for now.

355
00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:27.620
<v 0>Wow. I don't know if we should ever actually say never.</v>

356
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:29.900
<v 1>You said at the time she was like, you know, you're good.</v>

357
00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:33.140
We can take some time off because I started talking about the time I didn't get

358
00:18:33.141 --> 00:18:34.840
a bike when I was young.

359
00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:38.960
<v 0>Oh yes. You're reaching.</v>

360
00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.650
<v 1>I don't know what else to talk about. So I start reaching and, and she,</v>

361
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:47.030
I guess she knows that it's her job. So she's like, yeah. You know what?

362
00:18:47.031 --> 00:18:50.600
You're good. That's really, that matters. Happens all the time.

363
00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:56.210
<v 0>Oh, that's a red flag. Why you thought she was mom? Oh no.</v>

364
00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.030
[inaudible] you said you were yelling and screaming for awhile and now you're

365
00:19:02.031 --> 00:19:04.610
not. So I think that's a good set of why, because you realize.

366
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:09.770
<v 1>I would get very frustrated. I, I had what was called a irritable depression,</v>

367
00:19:09.771 --> 00:19:14.690
which is a depression that comes on when you're just frustrated and you're

368
00:19:14.691 --> 00:19:17.900
irritable and you don't know how to get it out. And so like,

369
00:19:17.901 --> 00:19:20.900
I'd be really frustrated about things going on at work,

370
00:19:20.901 --> 00:19:23.000
maybe at home or whatever. And I would yell and scream.

371
00:19:23.001 --> 00:19:25.550
But that what you learn is when you're yelling and screaming,

372
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:27.650
people just think you're an. They're not going to listen to you.

373
00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.320
Even though in your, in your heart, you know,

374
00:19:30.321 --> 00:19:31.820
you're right about this certain point.

375
00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:33.680
There are times you just know you're right. I think,

376
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:37.580
and other times it's open for discussion. Obviously I'm just fighting. Right,

377
00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.680
right. But things at work where I'm like, no,

378
00:19:39.681 --> 00:19:44.360
I know this is how it should be done, whatever. So, but when you're screaming,

379
00:19:44.361 --> 00:19:46.130
bloody murder, everyone just thinks you're a.

380
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.620
And then now they're not listening to the point you're actually trying to make.

381
00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:54.680
<v 3>Did you scream and yell at people at work? Not anymore. When,</v>

382
00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:58.910
when you went through the therapy, did you then go back and apologize?

383
00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.050
Try to make amends with people.

384
00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:02.653
<v 1>To a lot of people.</v>

385
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.790
<v 3>Over the years. And did anyone go you?</v>

386
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.910
<v 1>Uh, not to my face, but I'm sure they're like, yeah, whatever.</v>

387
00:20:07.911 --> 00:20:08.744
I'm still not over.

388
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:12.770
<v 3>Oh. So you can kind of feel it, you know? But you, you, you do what you can.</v>

389
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:13.490
Yeah.

390
00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:15.980
<v 1>You can do what you can. I apologize for a whole bunch of things.</v>

391
00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.970
So what do you think your parents did though? Me?

392
00:20:19.971 --> 00:20:22.100
It was definitely the yelling thing just drove me insane.

393
00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.700
<v 0>For me. It was the exact number. There was zero connecting. It was zero. I mean,</v>

394
00:20:25.701 --> 00:20:29.090
they said, I love you. And that was some shoulder padding, not a lot of hugs,

395
00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.570
but, uh, it was, I think it was just, there was no connection.

396
00:20:32.571 --> 00:20:35.150
They were busy at work. They come home. They go, you're the kid.

397
00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:39.530
Here's a piece of. You know, here's a chicken leg. And uh, yeah, that was it.

398
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:42.190
You know, if I'd be like, Hey dad, I'm pulling on his pant leg. Hey,

399
00:20:42.191 --> 00:20:46.190
I did this it's school to go. Yeah. Yeah. Whatever, go watch TV, older brother.

400
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:48.160
How's he get more attention.

401
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.930
<v 3>Than you can see. Does he go and get up?</v>

402
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.540
<v 0>No, he's got some problems too. And he's, but he's a certified genius.</v>

403
00:20:54.541 --> 00:20:59.010
Listen to this rap sheet on my brother certified genius went to the best high

404
00:20:59.011 --> 00:21:01.980
school in new Orleans, skipped his senior year to go straight to Berkeley,

405
00:21:01.981 --> 00:21:04.980
full scholarships. He's going to Berkeley. It's like a 17 year olds, like duty.

406
00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:09.210
How's their shoes. Yeah. Then he became a master fencer who fences.

407
00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.930
We get a master fencer, did a whole bunch of toured the world with fencing,

408
00:21:12.931 --> 00:21:16.230
these championships. Then he joined the peace Corps in Africa,

409
00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.920
helping poor kids on a, in a village, learn math.

410
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:23.370
So they could engineer and build pipes and you know, whatever. And, uh,

411
00:21:23.371 --> 00:21:25.560
they did that for two. I went and visit them. It was hell.

412
00:21:25.561 --> 00:21:28.710
I mean talking female circumcision, the whole thing. And uh,

413
00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:31.920
now he works for Google. He's like a millionaire living in new Orleans. Wow.

414
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:33.120
Yeah. And I'm a comedian.

415
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.020
<v 1>I think you're, I think your life's better. How about that?</v>

416
00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:39.930
<v 0>How about that? He, no, he's married with kids and he's always tells me,</v>

417
00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.050
like pulls me aside after a few beers. And he goes, don't do it really. Yeah.

418
00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.110
Which is interesting, but a weird Mark.

419
00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:47.340
<v 3>If it's better,</v>

420
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:52.470
but he's like imprisoned in his own psyche says the same thing.

421
00:21:52.471 --> 00:21:53.304
He's like.

422
00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.300
<v 1>Somehow you got to have a breakthrough. I, I need a breakthrough.</v>

423
00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:01.980
All you're going to need is just a little breakthrough.

424
00:22:01.981 --> 00:22:06.420
You'll start seeing that light. And then yeah, man, things starts to make sense.

425
00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:09.480
Especially when doing that gig regularly, working with Amy.

426
00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:13.320
<v 3>I did some tours with bands. I opened for Alison Chainz. Everything was like,</v>

427
00:22:13.321 --> 00:22:17.460
so pampered every yeah. That I really thought, I've worked so long for this.

428
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.280
This is an awesome feeling. And then when it ended and I went back to my own,

429
00:22:20.281 --> 00:22:24.780
whatever my own regular, uh, comedy thing was, it was like, I, you know,

430
00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:27.030
I knew to enjoy it at the time when it happened.

431
00:22:27.031 --> 00:22:31.320
I can't believe that you don't allow yourself to enjoy it while it's happening.

432
00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.450
And that's what a great gig.

433
00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.510
<v 0>Weird thing I'll do is I'll go to a lot of pictures on Instagram and I'll go</v>

434
00:22:36.511 --> 00:22:39.300
through them from like a year or two ago. No, no. I'm like,

435
00:22:39.301 --> 00:22:41.640
look how cool that was all. Look at that. And I go, wow,

436
00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:44.700
look at that and blow up like, who is this guy? That is amazing. And I'm like,

437
00:22:44.701 --> 00:22:45.534
that's you, you.

438
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.930
<v 1>[Inaudible] can I see it later? I can look at that. Wow.</v>

439
00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:55.350
That is fascinating too, because Mark is one of the good ones on Instagram.

440
00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:57.690
I'm a follower. I like your stuff all the time.

441
00:22:57.691 --> 00:23:01.440
He has a very good eye for photography. Try to make it a good photo or else.

442
00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.070
You're very serious about your Instagramming. Thank you.

443
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:09.630
Funny now that connection is really kind of interesting. Yes, exactly.

444
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:12.600
<v 0>I'm trying to capture that moment cause I can't enjoy it. So maybe you should.</v>

445
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:17.790
<v 1>So say should just take pictures of smoothies for now. I wish.</v>

446
00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:21.120
<v 3>So you tried to capture an image. That's good. Funny or good. Like, wow.</v>

447
00:23:21.121 --> 00:23:22.920
This is a great moment in my life.

448
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.470
<v 0>It's a little of both, but it's mostly look at this moment. Look,</v>

449
00:23:25.471 --> 00:23:29.070
I'm in a jet right now with this superstar or I'll look at this arena I'm doing

450
00:23:29.071 --> 00:23:33.840
or whatever the hell, you know, and uh, yeah. Some are funny, silly,

451
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:35.303
totally disconnected.

452
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:39.360
<v 1>Silly too. But I mean, in general, you're very artistic with your photos.</v>

453
00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:44.070
It's Martin Mormon on Instagram. We should take a break cause uh,

454
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:48.110
my cat is waiting the hall and uh, Mark she's.

455
00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:51.370
<v 0>Yeah. Well, thanks for letting me know. This is really fascinating. Hey,</v>

456
00:23:51.371 --> 00:23:54.910
anytime I appreciate the, the, the listening. No one else listens. Oh really?

457
00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:57.280
Yeah. Who the hell am I? Can I cut? What am I going to go? Hey mom,

458
00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:02.290
you've reached the wrong number, but as you're saying that out loud,

459
00:24:02.291 --> 00:24:04.840
is there any kind of realization that you're having, as you're saying all that,

460
00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.800
but it's like being left-handed, it's just, that's how I am. I can't rewire it.

461
00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.780
I guess I can really try it and be right-handed but it's going to take,

462
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:12.783
you know, a lot of work.

463
00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:15.070
<v 1>Why don't I, I got to keep going back to this.</v>

464
00:24:15.071 --> 00:24:18.130
Why don't you feel like you deserve to buy anything?

465
00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:20.650
<v 0>I think it has a lot to do with that house as a kid.</v>

466
00:24:20.651 --> 00:24:23.290
I think it had a lot to do with, uh, not being,

467
00:24:23.291 --> 00:24:26.770
if you're not treated as a human being, as a child,

468
00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.790
it just sticks with you. That's how your, your, your wiring is set.

469
00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:32.470
How are you not treated like a human being?

470
00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.100
Just like the zero attention zero who, you know, we don't,

471
00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:37.790
you're not even there. You're not,

472
00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:40.060
you're not looking past any attention that you were given.

473
00:24:40.061 --> 00:24:43.000
You really believe that you had zero attention. It was pretty low. Yeah.

474
00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:45.430
You know, all the, the love I needed it was it wasn't there.

475
00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:48.400
How did you know it was low? Were you able to compare it to your brother? No,

476
00:24:48.401 --> 00:24:51.280
I just that's life, but it,

477
00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.400
I only reason I know as low as cause of these symptoms I have now. Right?

478
00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:56.380
So he got the same zero,

479
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:59.770
but he put it all in the work and he's made a lot of money and he's got a family

480
00:24:59.771 --> 00:25:02.890
now who he loves. So he he's smarter than me. He made it work.

481
00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:06.430
I'm doing it with audiences. He's doing it with a family and money and a home.

482
00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:08.290
<v 1>Then in Brooklyn says you're just cheap.</v>

483
00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.400
<v 0>Plastic, Brooklyn answer.</v>

484
00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:15.820
<v 1>I wasn't deflecting. I was trying to think. And then we went back to Mark.</v>

485
00:25:15.821 --> 00:25:19.060
The guilt with me goes with, uh, when things are going well,

486
00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:21.310
because my house in my house,

487
00:25:21.311 --> 00:25:25.870
there was never a time where things were going well, there was always a problem.

488
00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.200
Right? Christmas is a, even though they tried their best, we're always.

489
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.440
Cause my mom had a lot of Christmases.

490
00:25:32.441 --> 00:25:35.770
So she brought the mood down every Christmas and then you're there as a kid,

491
00:25:35.771 --> 00:25:37.240
opening up your cool new stuff.

492
00:25:37.241 --> 00:25:41.050
And you almost felt guilty cause you were happy and enjoying,

493
00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:42.993
enjoying.

494
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:45.160
<v 0>That is heavy. And this went.</v>

495
00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.020
<v 1>And laid into my life where like,</v>

496
00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:49.720
even when I was having success with the radio show over the years and stuff,

497
00:25:49.721 --> 00:25:53.800
I felt guilty like, Oh, things are good. It's they're never supposed to be good.

498
00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:58.270
I would come home with some exciting news and my mom would be off and running

499
00:25:58.271 --> 00:26:00.580
because sneakers were left out some nonsense.

500
00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:05.890
And it was always supposed to just be just, just negative and sad in the house.

501
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.480
Yes. So I had to get through that,

502
00:26:07.481 --> 00:26:12.010
but I got the breakthrough and I I'm certainly enjoying my life way more now,

503
00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:12.910
but it took,

504
00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:17.830
it took a long time because you don't even understand why you have the guilt at

505
00:26:17.831 --> 00:26:21.040
first. You're like, why am I guilty? Because you know, I'm happy.

506
00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.350
And the radio shows going well and I, you know.

507
00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.400
<v 0>You have to rewire your whole system. It's not easy. It takes a while.</v>

508
00:26:27.401 --> 00:26:30.490
So you weren't even able to realize that that guilt was always there until you

509
00:26:30.491 --> 00:26:31.324
went to bed.

510
00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:35.950
<v 1>Yeah. That's right. We're not supposed to be, you know, kind of happy. Right.</v>

511
00:26:35.951 --> 00:26:37.540
You know, you kinda knew,

512
00:26:37.541 --> 00:26:41.410
and that was the guilt because you would leave this depressing situation,

513
00:26:41.411 --> 00:26:45.060
go back to my apartment in this case and, and then be happy and like, uh,

514
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:48.820
you know, and then feeling the guilt. Like you're, you know, it's yeah.

515
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:52.800
That attachment to the, uh, the house or whatever. So how man.

516
00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:57.410
<v 4>This is a heavy yeah, great. This is fine. We got to take a break. My poor guys.</v>

517
00:26:57.650 --> 00:26:58.190
They're just bored.

518
00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:00.680
<v 1>By it. He's giving me the, come on, wrapping up, wrapping.</v>

519
00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:04.400
<v 4>Up. This is the good there. Eric, who cares? If we have to break,</v>

520
00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.460
I'm not going to stop Mark. When he says he can't buy a smoothie.
