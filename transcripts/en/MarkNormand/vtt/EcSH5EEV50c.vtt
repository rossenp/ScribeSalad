00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.360
<v 0>Appreciate it. Great thighs, good chest hair.</v>

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.380
Nice face and a great stash.

3
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.100
We've got three shows in the park. This is the first one.

4
00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:13.050
They're all in central park. We're going to do this one.

5
00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:15.690
We're going to run to the other one on 79th and whatever.

6
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.930
Then we're going to do that one and come back and close these the third one out,

7
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.370
which is back here. This is comedy. Now it's in a park. There's no microphone.

8
00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:27.660
You're basically just a hobo, screaming to strangers, uh,

9
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.010
in the park. All right, here we go. Culminate. All right.

10
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.600
Where do we begin? I mean,

11
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.040
we've got to address the elephant and the anal Corona. It's a, it's a. We all,

12
00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:42.150
we're all sick of it. That's why we're here. You know, Corona has been so long.

13
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:45.300
It feels like the check engine light, you know, at first you're scared of it.

14
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.560
Then after a while, you're like, it. I gotta go to work. I hate it.

15
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.560
I can't believe this whole thing started because some guy the back.

16
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.650
Um, I feel like, uh, like a woman in arranged marriage. You know, I, uh,

17
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.610
I didn't choose this. I got to cover my face. And if I say my opinion,

18
00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:05.640
I get yelled at all right.

19
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.200
I can't tell if I'm bombing or if in the park, we'll say both.

20
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.000
That was brutal. I mean, Hey, you're outdoors. You have no microphone.

21
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.430
There's no ceiling there's music. That was brutal. That was the first one.

22
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.630
My ego is through the floor. Let's go to the other one. Yeah, this is,

23
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.570
this is comedy now folks. It's a pretty depressing.

24
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.490
That's what we have to offer. Lot of skin. I think we're a little,

25
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.600
when my bill early to God starts in 10 minutes. We were perfect.

26
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.780
<v 1>Hey, career, low point.</v>

27
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.720
<v 0>I don't know anything. I don't watch the news. Uh, I did hear R Kelly got, uh,</v>

28
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.770
he got interviewed and he said a COVID 19 too old for me.

29
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.850
That's where you guys. All right, there you go. We're getting there.

30
00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.410
It's crowds like anal. It takes a minute. Eventually. It'll feel good.

31
00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:04.610
That's what my stepdad told me. Oh,

32
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.170
that's my stepdad. Whew. That is a miscarriage on wheels.

33
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.640
Holy hell God. That was,

34
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.500
that was appalling. Good luck. I don't even blame them. You know,

35
00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:23.240
it's just not the right setting. Oh man. One more, one more.

36
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.190
Ah, well this is comedy companies are positive. Unlike Corona.

37
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.290
I hope on the next show. I get one laugh.

38
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.820
Ah, do we need to just for parking? This one is, uh,

39
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.980
hopefully one day I can open for Nick cannon. Let's go do that last show.

40
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.420
Hey, thank you.

41
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.060
I'm going to be a lot darker than the other guys. This is the great gig.

42
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.800
Next week. I'm doing a target Minneapolis. So I can't complain. Yeah.

43
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.600
Blackville got hit really hard by COVID,

44
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.020
which shocks me because they usually handle illness so well they're strong

45
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:14.140
people. I mean, look at magic Johnson. He's still going. All right.

46
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.190
Hell he beat Kobe.

47
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.600
That joke. I liked him. Didn't land.

48
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.130
<v 2>Oh words.</v>

49
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.530
<v 0>This kills at a comedy club. Uh, but you guys are nice, you know, little square,</v>

50
00:03:31.531 --> 00:03:34.440
but you're all right. You know, some comedians out there. Hey, woke people.

51
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.350
I mean, none more than Cosby. Thanks a lot. I'm Kevin Hart.

52
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.333
<v 2>Have a good night.</v>

53
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.150
<v 0>Last show of the night. We got three in and one park. That's gotta be a record.</v>

54
00:03:45.151 --> 00:03:47.250
Three shows in one park. I mean,

55
00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:51.630
aside from a crazy hobo that's I think we set a new precedent

56
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.760
yelling at strangers, no microphone. Everything was against us.

57
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.190
I stepped on a heroin needle. I have AIDS, but comedy lives.

58
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.830
We've got to keep doing it. We got to keep going. You got to make it work.

59
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.150
I hate myself. I'll see you in hell Kanye 2020.
