00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.400
It's a nice place. You know, the chandelier's looked like, ah,

14
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.290
This is a nice touch. The light up sign. We don't have to buy a sign.

15
00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:07.880
We'll just put a projector up. But thanks for coming.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.120
I appreciate it. You know, we're indoors. Spooky.

17
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.480
I might die. Uh, but at least we went out with a bang, right, sir? Yes.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.740
You look. All right. I'll pick it up. Just got up here.

19
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.500
But I will say this we're all adults here, but you wouldn't. How old are you?

20
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.680
Yeah. Oh, we're not all adults here, but uh,

21
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.380

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.940
No wonder. I'm hard. Yeah. Holy hell.

23
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.350
The hell's going on over here. And is this your brother? Oh, thank God.

24
00:01:45.351 --> 00:01:48.920

30
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.120
That was a tough group, man. Did I die up there? We've got one more show.

31
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.000
Now we're gonna hit the diner. Ooh.

I think we got to clean this room out after for a bar mitzvah. It's coming in.

34
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.950
Yeah. Oh boy. Oh boy. This is really the height of humor. Isn't it?

35
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.130
This is a career peak for me. I love the spacing.

36
00:02:34.131 --> 00:02:38.390
It looks like you guys were all at each other. This looks like a funeral order.

37
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.110
Nobody I'll be like the guy who died, but you got a good chuckle, sir.

38
00:02:42.111 --> 00:02:43.970
And I can tell you have a pretty decent penis.

39
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.050
Look at the arms on that guy. What? He is six, two, six,

40
00:02:51.051 --> 00:02:54.920
seven. Get the out of. Holy hell.

41
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.680
One of those buckets. Was that just food for you? You're just feeding you.

42
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:03.850
Put it around your neck, like a horse. Six, seven.

43
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.510
Is it weird if I asked you to stand up? All right.

44
00:03:07.511 --> 00:03:12.340
I'm sure you get it all the time. Oh wow. Yeah. There you go.

45
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.630
All right. Yeah. Don't applaud him. Applaud his mom's broken vagina.

46
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.330
Jesus, grace. How that helps you push that thing out? Oh my God.

47
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.490

48
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.900
