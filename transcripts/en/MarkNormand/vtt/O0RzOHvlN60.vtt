All right. Just a heads up all the way up. No elevator.

4
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.630
It's not going to be pretty.

5
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.393
That's my agent.

6
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.350
Hey, look at that company. Share. Wow. Hey, new stuff. Don't judge me.

00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:46.340

00:00:51.381 --> 00:00:52.670

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.980
<v 0>Hey, thank you. Hey buddy. Uh,</v>

12
00:01:00.981 --> 00:01:04.190
I don't know if any of you guys have kids that sucks for you guys with the

13
00:01:04.191 --> 00:01:06.530
schools being closed. It's actually good for me though.

14
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.160
Cause now I can drive by him again. Hold on,

15
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.110
wait for the MTA. God it never been handled by a train.

16
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.100
Um, I just don't understand what's going on as much. You know,

17
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.970
Corona's a lot like the stock market. I checked the numbers every day.

18
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.790
It keeps fluctuating and I don't know what's happening,

19
00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:29.360
but I know I'm still losing money. Um,

20
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.130
a lot of couples here, that's exciting that guy's exhausted. All right,

21
00:01:34.131 --> 00:01:38.210
this is good. I'm working on jokes and getting skin cancer.

22
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.540
I know this feels more like summer camp.

23
00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:44.690
Doesn't it sip this booze and less pedophiles.

24
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.050
This is nice to be out and everything. I'm actually a quarantee with my abuser,

25
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.000
my brain. Thank you.

26
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.670

29
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.420
I got to get that puppy down

30
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.730
on the fifth floor and then we can go up there and bomb.

31
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.700
<v 1>Without further ado. Ladies and gentlemen, I'll bring him up to the stage.</v>

32
00:02:25.701 --> 00:02:27.020
Give it up for the one and all that Mark.

33
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.520

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.840
Hey John Wilkes booth seat over there.

36
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.320
Don't shoot me. Good crowd. I've been watching the NBA.

37
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.200
Uh, the stands are empty, so it's a weird, the NBA is weird with it.

38
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.620
The empty stands. No we should do just to fill those up,

39
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.320

40
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.350
Black guys like that one. Scared to laugh now. Why he's.

Well that's one of us. Um, cool.

46
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.270
All right. I don't like me.

47
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.190

They're still open where the woman has the mask on, but no underwear.

49
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.960
I treated one lip for another, you know? And, uh, it's crazy. Cause you know,
