00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.770
<v 0>Hey comedy, huh? Whoo. Still not really sure what this is,</v>

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.820
but I'm glad to be here. It feels like a comedy show,

3
00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:13.020
but it looks like a porn shoot. Uh, just confused.

4
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.350
I feel bad for kids. So much stimulus coming at kids. I phone internet,

5
00:00:16.351 --> 00:00:18.630
social media. Remember I have to go lucky where his kids,

6
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.000
not a care in the world. Maybe run to the car. Shotgun.

7
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.110
That was like the biggest problem. My life shotgun. Yeah.

8
00:00:25.111 --> 00:00:26.580
I never see kids doing that anymore.

9
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.770
The only time a kid yells it out now is in a classroom.

10
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.680
A lot of racial talk now white privilege. That's a term.

11
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.200
We hear a lot now white privilege, but I thought it was all about diversity.

12
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:35.630
So should we talk about everybody's privileges? Why?

13
00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:37.440
We're just limiting it to Whitey. Let's spread the love.

14
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.960
Let's make every group feel good. Everybody's got something to all people.

15
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:43.230
Privileged seat. A concert Jews. No. Hell

16
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.990
pretty good. Pretty good women. Ladies night. That's cool.

17
00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:53.880
Black people. I can't wear a purple suit. Can't keep up with the terms.

18
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.290
You know, some PCI leg like native American. That's good. He's not from India.

19
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.510
Where are we going in India? Native American grade. I'll say that,

20
00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:02.970
but like African-American I feel weird saying I don't mean African-American

21
00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:06.090
friends. I have black friends, only Caucasian friends. I have relatives.

22
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.180
None of it adds up. We're only African Canadians. Why don't we say that?

23
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.520
Black people born Cain every day.

24
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.170
We don't know what the hell we're saying anymore.

25
00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:16.560
We'll be like Ijaz Elvis and amazing African-American actor. Well, he's British.

26
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.970
Yeah. I think white people just scare to say in the word black.

27
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.000
We're just trying to avoid that at all costs. We don't get in trouble. You know,

28
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.580
you could corner a white guy with a microphone, a video camera.

29
00:01:26.581 --> 00:01:28.860
Like what color is Ray? Charles? He'd be like, ah, he's blind.

30
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.560
<v 1>What's his ethnicity? Piano player. What color is his skin? I got kids, man.</v>

31
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.513
Come on.

32
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.440
<v 0>I think we're all sick of this though. We're all. I mean,</v>

33
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.100
Corona is kind of like the check engine light. You know,

34
00:01:43.101 --> 00:01:45.230
when you first hear about it, you're like, this is terrifying.

35
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.350
And after a while you're like, I gotta get to work. I mean,

36
00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:50.240
this is a tough time in history for black people,

37
00:01:50.241 --> 00:01:51.230
black people are going through it.

38
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.350
The two people have a tough right now where black people and women named Karen,

39
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.280
they were having a tough.

40
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.680
<v 1>Go. Um, but.</v>

41
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.140
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. Bore black women. They're they're they're yeah,</v>

42
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.120
they got hit hard by the disease. You know,

43
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.000
which I'm shocked by because black are so strong. I'm surprised.

44
00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:07.520
I thought they'd be fine with illness. I mean, look at magic Johnson.

45
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.510
He's still kicking. He's doing great. Hell he beat Coby.

46
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.990
<v 1>I know who saw that coming.</v>

47
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.100
Yeah. You got to live life books. Yeah. I know.

48
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.380
<v 0>Blackpool or getting sick. I blame institutionalized racism and elaborate.</v>

49
00:02:33.381 --> 00:02:37.280
Handshakes. Come on. I told an abortion joke recently and a woman approach me.

50
00:02:37.281 --> 00:02:39.710
She was like, Hey, that's very insensitive. I've had an abortion.

51
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.140
You shouldn't tell jokes like that. I was like, Whoa, Hey, sorry.

52
00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:43.880
I just told a joke. I think what you did was much.

53
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.713
<v 1>Worse.</v>

54
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.990
<v 0>Yeah. You guys can say a lot of stuff.</v>

55
00:02:47.991 --> 00:02:50.930
Like my last girlfriend dumped me said I wasn't manly enough for her.

56
00:02:50.931 --> 00:02:54.860
Not a manly guy. That one hurt. I know we're allowed to say stuff like that.

57
00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:57.290
Like I'm all about equality, but how can a woman can say something like, yeah,

58
00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.950
like guy was good with his hands. He could fix stuff around the go. You're cool.

59
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.560
But if a guy says, Hey, I like what would been cooked? People go, Whoa, Whoa.

60
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:05.290
It's not the fifties. Well, how come her drive for me is okay.

61
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:06.520
But my job for her is that okay.

62
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.700
Also who doesn't like somebody who can fix around the house.

63
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.210
I'd love to come home. My girlfriend's like, Hey, but it was a Dick ride.

64
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.480
Awesome. I'll do laundry. See, I think women are you're.

65
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.990
You guys are so smart because you guys made your gender roles offensive.

66
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.350
Yeah. That was very clever.

67
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.220
Well played ladies. Well-played guys. How great would that be?

68
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:35.890
If we could offend a Negro up and wake up at 4:00 AM. I heard glass shattering.

69
00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:38.080
Somebody break in. You're like, well it's not the fifties. Go check it out.

70
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.190
My ex-girlfriend very paranoid. Always going through my phone. Sock drawer,

71
00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:43.900
sniffing me, always looking for clues.

72
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.950
That's why I'm surprised you don't see more female detectives, ladies.

73
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:50.500
You guys would be amazing at that. You guys are intuitive. You're curious.

74
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:53.020
You're persistent. I feel like you gals would crack every case.

75
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:57.670
As long as you thought it was personal. That's the key like, man,

76
00:03:57.671 --> 00:03:59.380
this guy killed 18 people in Fresno.

77
00:03:59.381 --> 00:04:02.080
So what he's also cheating on your best friend. Give me the file.

78
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.210
<v 1>See the problem with the phone is this they'll cut off. Like with booze,</v>

79
00:04:06.211 --> 00:04:07.770
you drink too much. Somebody goes, Hey, you've had enough.

80
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.700
Or your body cuts you off. You pass out. You just fall down.

81
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.200
You puke phone. No cutoff. We need like a phone bouncer. There's a guy like,

82
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.770
Hey, you can't get it. And you're like, but that's mine. That's big.

83
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.270
It's my place. Oh, I heard a phone.

84
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.100
Um, I don't, I'm just some way on my phone. Way more than booze.

85
00:04:29.101 --> 00:04:31.830
Like I've never been like, Oh, I gotta take a. Where the hell is my cocktail

86
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.190
for six. I can't have a cocktail. No cargo for six minutes. It's insane.

87
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.080
All right. Um, we'll keep it moving. You look.

88
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.230
You don't believe me.

89
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.780
<v 2>And then after six minutes on the toilet,</v>

90
00:04:48.781 --> 00:04:50.340
you don't ask why you don't have a car.

91
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.010
<v 1>That's the joke. Just shut up.</v>

92
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.340
We'll talk later. All right. Um, cool. All right.

93
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.140
Hopefully, uh, what the hell was I talking about? Oh yeah.

94
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.480
So yeah, the gaze.

95
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.090
<v 0>Yeah. It was just so sexy and drive me crazy.</v>

96
00:05:12.091 --> 00:05:13.830
I want to just want to put stuff in. Yeah. Oh,

97
00:05:13.831 --> 00:05:18.330
you're so hot with your wacky Libya. I love it. Yeah. This is um,

98
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.790
this is how sexy girls are. I was up at dinner.

99
00:05:20.791 --> 00:05:23.490
Once this girl leans over during the meal and goes, Hey,

100
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.220
I'm not wearing any underwear. I was like, Oh my God, that's hot.

101
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.650
Then I realized, why is that sexy as underwear?

102
00:05:28.651 --> 00:05:32.370
Everybody who jobs before a guy has any guy ever taken a girl's jeans off,

103
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.860
seen pain? He's been like, Ooh, it's going to be a long night.

104
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:41.220
When a pot of coffee on, I can't crack that code. Let's go hot. You are girls.

105
00:05:41.221 --> 00:05:42.750
You can tell by article of clothing. You're not wearing.

106
00:05:42.751 --> 00:05:44.910
I can't even see it missing. I'm already turned on. Yeah.

107
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.090
That's a word for me as a guy. I can't pull that off. I lean over during dinner.

108
00:05:48.091 --> 00:05:52.050
Hey, I'm not wearing any underwear. She's going to go up. Oh, what happened?

109
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.760
Monitor day. Diarrhea. Need a wet wipe. Talk to me.

110
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.410
Seems like a lot of people are quitting. The booze now it's kinda going away.

111
00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:02.810
All my friends are getting sober. Look. That's good.

112
00:06:02.811 --> 00:06:04.250
But some people are better when they're drinking.

113
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.290
There's a lot of bad sobers out there. Yeah.

114
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.800
We always start with the negative part about booze. What about the good,

115
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.920
like sure. You drove through a playground, but you could dance, man.

116
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.100
I try not to make fun of fat people unless they make fun of me.

117
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.570
That's when I let it go. Yeah. Like all my fat friends give me.

118
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.450
One of my frat friends told me I have skinny privilege.

119
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.400
Like privilege something. Can't be a privilege if you could do it too. Ah,

120
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.460
pedophilia. Huh? Any pedophiles here?

121
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.580
I mean, statistically, it's gotta be too. Right. But Hey, we're all adults here,

122
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:38.900
which is a sentence they hate.

123
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.100
<v 1>Yeah. Comedy comedy,</v>

124
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.380
comedy comedy. Huh? Thanks a lot. I'm Kevin Hart and have a good night.

125
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:56.100
Thanks a lot. I'm Kevin Hart. Kevin. Thanks a lot.

126
00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.250
Kevin, Kevin Hart have a good night. Thank you.
