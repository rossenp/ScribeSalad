00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.210
<v 0>You're not going to believe this one. It was the last week of senior year.</v>

2
00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:05.520
So we're just getting crazy. We're about to graduate.

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.390
So we're at this park having a big cake party, just middle of the day.

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.110
So then this is this high school or high school where I went to a Catholic high

5
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:15.510
school where in our uniforms, we got to like a half day. So we were like,

6
00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:18.510
let's go to the park. We've got a keg. We're out there. It's like, you know,

7
00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:23.190
a hundred of us drinking. So my friend, who was like a sophomore,

8
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.000
his, it wasn't Pakistani. His name was like, like packing esteem,

9
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.680
Jeff Pakistan or something. So we called him.

10
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.460
<v 1>He shows up with my friend, dirty Turk.</v>

11
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.560
So.

12
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.320
<v 0>Crazy kid who we let hang around us. He was way younger.</v>

13
00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:42.460
He was like two feet tall, skinny as hell. But he was, he was,

14
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.140
he would do anything. You said like, go jump off that building,

15
00:00:45.141 --> 00:00:47.300
go say a racial slur. And in front of that guy.

16
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.510
<v 1>But he was fearless, really shine for a little bit. I think his name's Steve-O,</v>

17
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.380
he's still doing pretty good in and out of boarding school.

18
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.470
<v 0>Like parents killed themselves in front of him. One of these kids, you know,</v>

19
00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:04.640
just seeing it all. He was up for anything. So where are we? He goes, Oh,

20
00:01:04.641 --> 00:01:07.370
I got to get something. Oh, there's a house party. There's a house party.

21
00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:10.310
So we jumped in my car to convertible. We jump in my car,

22
00:01:10.311 --> 00:01:13.430
we're going to this house party. We're in our uniforms and everything.

23
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.490
And I'm trying to it's rush hour now. So I'm trying to get into a,

24
00:01:16.491 --> 00:01:19.580
a lane to merge off the highway and I go, Hey man, can I get in?

25
00:01:19.581 --> 00:01:23.810
Can I get in the guy goes, Nope, gives me like a hard, Nope. And I was like,

26
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.860
this guy. So I get in behind him and I bumped him just for the hell of it.

27
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.390
We're hammered, you know, it's, you know, it's.

28
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.870
<v 1>I give him a little Taparoo. So he's like, he's in the beer. That one,</v>

29
00:01:35.871 --> 00:01:40.850
the idea of drunk driving me. I just gave her a little Taparoo Tapper.

30
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.380
So he's like in the mirror, like what the is going on here?

31
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.500
We're doing like the BA blow me heat.

32
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.510
<v 0>A ponytail. It was a whole thing. No offense.</v>

33
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.550
<v 1>Whatever you drunk boat dad.</v>

34
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.130
<v 0>No. Um, so he's like, you I'll kill you, whatever. And then, uh, we're like, Oh,</v>

35
00:02:01.131 --> 00:02:05.420
this guy wants to play. So I tap him again. Now he puts his car in park.

36
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.310
<v 1>Send me over the edge. That would make me so. Like if you did it, like</v>

37
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.180
in the beginning, we go, what's wrong with Mark's brain. I love that. Mark goes,

38
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.090
Oh, this guy wants to play. Huh? So I tap them again,

39
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.790
say this isn't new Orleans.

40
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.360
<v 0>So he puts the car in park. He gets out. So now we're like, Oh, this,</v>

41
00:02:23.361 --> 00:02:26.600
this is on, you know, there's two of us. I got here, back and forth.

42
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.830
<v 1>Just lunge at him like a rat. He real quick take out his knees.</v>

43
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.650
<v 0>No claws neck. So, uh, he gets out and he walks past me.</v>

44
00:02:36.651 --> 00:02:40.280
So I'm kinda like ready walks past me, goes to the back of the car,

45
00:02:40.281 --> 00:02:44.000
reads my license plate, memorizes. It walks back up,

46
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.990
slams his fist on my hood and gets in his car. And I was like, huh, well,

47
00:02:47.991 --> 00:02:50.990
that was weird. So now traffic's kind of moving a little bit and I'm like,

48
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.730
this guy, what cop? No, no, no. He was, he had like a sandals on and shorts.

49
00:02:55.731 --> 00:02:58.310
He was like a hippie kind of guy. So now I'm like, well, that was weird.

50
00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:00.580
But he's on a cell phone. This is when cell phones were like,

51
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.150
if somebody is on a cell phone, you noticed it. The big brick. And I was like,

52
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.360
Oh, that's weird. So now we're on the main streets and I'm following him,

53
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:08.230
but something's up.

54
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.910
And then he gets to a green light stops and I stopped behind him.

55
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.130
Everybody's like, why isn't this guy going here in the green light?

56
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.910
There's a bar on the corner. A guy runs out of the bar,

57
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.260
jumps in my convertible. Jesus Christ, crazy.

58
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:26.000
And a leather jacket on. He was just day drinking at some bar.

59
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.250
It was we're like.

60
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.960
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

61
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.000
<v 0>Yeah, Becky. So, so I'm driving now. The,</v>

62
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.650
the guy in the car peels off, he's like, I'm outta here. these guys.

63
00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:38.790
But my friend will handle this.

64
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.440
<v 1>Ex-con or whatever. That guy, the guy who waits at bars for the phone call.</v>

65
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.240
So Jeff,

66
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.160
I've been waiting for this call years. This man saved my life and I

67
00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.300
put it on my tab, takes a drink, shoots it. He goes,

68
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.330
build another one. I'll be back in five fingers.

69
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.620
<v 0>Or slings, open clink. Lingling jumps in the backseat, pulls Packy back there.</v>

70
00:04:07.621 --> 00:04:08.130
They're having fun.

71
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.940
<v 1>This fight on their knees in the back seat, just like a cartoon</v>

72
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.263
drive and looking backwards,

73
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.530
trying to not kill myself because we're on the street. The street is moving.

74
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.140
So I'm like, I'm like trying to do swings like back here,

75
00:04:25.141 --> 00:04:28.290
like trying to help Packy, like doing some backward hammers, you know,

76
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.340
[inaudible] her children in the backseat. [inaudible] turn this car around.

77
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.110
Exactly creepy. So this is a man, this is a guy he's balding.

78
00:04:40.111 --> 00:04:42.690
He's got a leather jacket on with patches on it. And he, you know,

79
00:04:42.691 --> 00:04:45.810
he's got a half a beer. This is a dude feeding them kids.

80
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.720
<v 0>I'm a kid. But that,</v>

81
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.510
that retard mom's strength kicks in where you're just like scared for your life.

82
00:04:51.511 --> 00:04:52.344
You know, fight or flight.

83
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.970
<v 1>He's like windmill, windmill, windmill.</v>

84
00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.100
And uh, so I just scrapped.

85
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.600
<v 0>Becky, push him out, push him out. It's a packet, get some kind of deal.</v>

86
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.310
<v 1>But he just gets up under the guy and goes, ah, the guy goes over the backseat</v>

87
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.760
to the street. And then like cars buying. Try not to hit him.

88
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.800
Somebody runs over his hand and I'm like, Oh, the guy goes,

89
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.200
Oh my God, what is happening? So we go to the house party and was like,

90
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.960
Oh my God, you're not going to it with telling everybody I got a whole pal.

91
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.710
Right?

92
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.710
<v 0>The living room. I'm like this crazy pushed about it. Wasn't saying,</v>

93
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.260
and Peggy's just sitting in the corner smoking. Not saying anything.

94
00:05:34.261 --> 00:05:35.100
He was a psycho.

95
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.830
<v 1>I think he's since died. But uh, I usually have with you at all times. Yeah.</v>

96
00:05:40.831 --> 00:05:44.280
I think he's dead now. There's no way that guy's alive. Oh my God.

97
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.080
He got the hit or something. He took that guy seat at the bar. Yes,

98
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.560
exactly. That's the only way to get that.

99
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.220
[inaudible] it's like when you go to a dojo and you beat the mess, we wait,

100
00:05:56.221 --> 00:05:58.280
wait. So how does this story end? Alright.

101
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.030
<v 0>So we're at the party and I had a beeper at the time and it was one of those</v>

102
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.760
clear beepers where you could see the electronics.

103
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.230
So my mom was going like call mom, mom nine one, one, mom, mom, dad,

104
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:12.200
dad called mom. We love you. What happened? You know? And I'm like, Whoa.

105
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.220
So I call my mom, you know, I'm like, hello, trying to be sober. And she's like,

106
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.100
the police are here. Get the over here. I don't know where you are.

107
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:21.380
I don't know what you did. But I got six cops in the living room.

108
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:24.920
I'm feeding them coffee. They're all waiting. You're going to jail. Come over,

109
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.330
hung up. And I'm like, Oh my God.

110
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.250
<v 1>Quick. Get in the car, switch clothes with me.</v>

111
00:06:30.251 --> 00:06:33.700
I'm going to need you to be me for a month when packet getting shot on your law.

112
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.820
<v 0>Yeah. So I was like, Oh. And here's the, the clinker, this is where I got saved.</v>

113
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.330
So I go, I guess I got to go home. And my friend Jay goes, wait,

114
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.560
if you're going home, you reek of booze. You look like, hell swallow,

115
00:06:47.561 --> 00:06:50.830
a big gulp of this. And he handed me a jar, a Jif.

116
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.310
If you put peanut butter in your mouth, you can't smell booze.

117
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.980
I didn't know that some guys keep peanut butter in their glove box,

118
00:06:56.981 --> 00:06:59.860
just in case they get pulled over. It, it works a hundred percent.

119
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.140
<v 1>Um, but um,</v>

120
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.540
I was eating peanut butter and driving on a Mr. Ed.

121
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.960
<v 0>Yeah. So, uh, I was like, all right, I put the peanut butter in.</v>

122
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.920
I drive home and this cop cars all out in the front lawn and everything.

123
00:07:17.921 --> 00:07:19.630
And I go in, they're all sitting there. And my mom's like,

124
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.020
this is him when he was 14. He was just showing him like the scrapbooks and.

125
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:27.190
Yeah. He was a bed wetter. Here's his Bunky boot. And it's a little, you know,

126
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.670
toy with the eye missing. So I go in there like son,

127
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.670
we got to have a long talk with you. You're in deep, blah, blah, blah.

128
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.710
And I'm like, I don't know what you're talking about. And they go, well,

129
00:07:35.711 --> 00:07:38.440
just don't lie to us. And they keep looking at my eye and they keep going,

130
00:07:38.441 --> 00:07:39.610
let me smell your breath. I went.

131
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:42.243
<v 1>He smells like</v>

132
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:47.380
any normal 18 year old kid and falling full of peanut butter

133
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.370
drives a convertible. Your parents. Weren't smart enough to be like,

134
00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:55.600
we should probably have a lawyer here since they're both lawyers. lawyers.

135
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.630
<v 0>Yeah, I guess so. But they didn't know what they think of an angel or something.</v>

136
00:07:58.631 --> 00:08:01.390
They're just like, Oh, this is, we'll settle this up and get this over with.

137
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.360
So the guy goes, a guy says,

138
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:09.520
you ran over him with your 71 Brown Cutlass convertible. And they go outside.

139
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:13.240
This is my 71 Brown Cutlass convertible. You're like, well, this checks out.

140
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:15.820
And I go, I'm going to be honest with you.

141
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:20.440
A guy jumped in my back seat and we pushed him out and that's all we knew.

142
00:08:20.441 --> 00:08:24.850
Self-defense and the guy goes, all right.

143
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.130
And then I had to go to court with my dad, like 200.

144
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:32.470
<v 1>Another case solved by new Orleans.</v>

145
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:38.560
And that was it guys. He's white. We don't believe him. You want to go to court.

146
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.020
<v 0>For what? I had to go to court because the guy press charges.</v>

147
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:45.070
<v 1>Against you. He jumped in your car and then press charges against you.</v>

148
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:47.710
<v 0>Yeah. He was just crying and trying to get a buck. Clearly,</v>

149
00:08:47.711 --> 00:08:50.980
these guys were end of their rope, like Evie white guys,

150
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.130
and nothing came out of it. Now they came out, we just denied, denied, denied.

151
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.000
So hopefully you'll hear. And did he say like, you just hit him?

152
00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:00.210
Was that his story? He said, I just hit him and then kept going. And I said,

153
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:03.600
he jumped in my backseat and they were like, well, you didn't mention that.

154
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.360
You know? And I was like, yeah, what the hell was I supposed to do? I'm a kid.

155
00:09:06.361 --> 00:09:07.710
This guy jumps on my back seat. What are you.

156
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:13.100
<v 1>Did the police talk to? No, no, no, no. He's in the wind.</v>

157
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:17.030
<v 0>Yeah. knows how to escape. He sees a signal. Then he runs into a tree.</v>

158
00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.240
He's got a sixth sense. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
