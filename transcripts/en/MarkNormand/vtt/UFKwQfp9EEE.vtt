1
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:06.360
<v 0>For me, my worst gigs were always when I first started,</v>

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.680
because I didn't know any better.

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.893
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.000
<v 0>People were like, do you want 50 bucks to do like a bar mitzvah? You know,</v>

5
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:17.640
for 200 people and you think, yeah.

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.080
What 50 bucks that's the most I've ever been paid for anything. And, you know,

7
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.070
would you have anything from the early days of like now looking back you're

8
00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:26.904
like, what was that?

9
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.420
<v 1>Oh yeah. I mean, I took any gig.</v>

10
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.780
I took a gig once upstate and it was like a five-hour drive.

11
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.900
It'd be in three guys, got drunk on the way up. And we get there,

12
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.890
it was in Minerva, New York. And it was so rural that,

13
00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:44.600
that our cell phones didn't work. And it was in a biker bar. And,

14
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.780
uh, you know, the guy was like, all right, you just gotta fill.

15
00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:50.000
It was three of us. And he's like, you gotta do an hour and a half.

16
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.410
And I probably had like four minutes to my name. That was good. And plus,

17
00:00:54.411 --> 00:00:57.710
you know, I'm living in New York, so it's a bunch of like, I like gays,

18
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.480
you know, gay guys are fun and all this, you know, liberal. And, uh,

19
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.550
they were not having it. And you know, I'm,

20
00:01:04.551 --> 00:01:07.640
I'm bombing within two minutes and I have 28 minutes to go.

21
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.550
I can tell they're going to hate all my material. So I'm trying to riff.

22
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.990
And finally they hate us, the whole thing. We're standing on a pool table,

23
00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:17.960
by the way we finished the night, everybody does their half-hour.

24
00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:20.300
Everybody eats and they hate us.

25
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.160
And we walk up to the bar and the bartender goes that wasn't enough time.

26
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.020
And we're like, Hey, we did at least a half hour each. And uh, he's like, well,

27
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.870
my, my audience wants more and I'm paying you. And I'm telling you,

28
00:01:32.871 --> 00:01:36.680
you need to do more time. And the guy who got the gig was like, dude,

29
00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:41.020
you don't get comedy. You know, you do an hour and a half. It's over like this.

30
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.820
This is it. You paid for it. We gave it to you. And that's it.

31
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.110
And plus we did our act. We can't go back up there. They hate us and we're done,

32
00:01:48.111 --> 00:01:51.470
we're out of material. And he's like, well, you better get back up there.

33
00:01:51.471 --> 00:01:56.210
And he put a gun on the bar, but a shotgun on the bar. And we were like,

34
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.810
that's, let's hit it, baby. Let's get back up there.

35
00:01:59.811 --> 00:02:01.640
So we went back up and did more time.

36
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.100
<v 0>Man. That's insane.</v>

37
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.630
It's crazy that in a story where you're standing on a pool table,

38
00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:10.970
that's one of the most Tang things.

39
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.070
<v 1>Yeah, it was bad. It was really weird to sleep there.</v>

40
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.080
<v 0>When, when you got there and they were like, Hey,</v>

41
00:02:18.081 --> 00:02:20.360
you're going to have to stand on the pool table where you like,

42
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.420
but that's not right. I mean, or.

43
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.580
<v 1>A little, but we were also like, Hey,</v>

44
00:02:25.581 --> 00:02:29.840
it's kind of a stain we'll make do we're faced. You know, we're at a bar,

45
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.680
there's a biker guys are here. Like we just kinda did whatever. He said,

46
00:02:33.681 --> 00:02:37.490
these guys were terrifying and tough and leathery. And you know,

47
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.980
there's no cell phone service up there. I mean,

48
00:02:39.981 --> 00:02:43.820
it was the whole thing was terrified, but, uh, we slept there too.

49
00:02:43.821 --> 00:02:45.110
I remember we got so drunk.

50
00:02:45.111 --> 00:02:48.980
We had to sleep in the back and they had some cabins and we almost got like a

51
00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:52.550
fist fight with one of the guys. And it was a rough, rough gig.

52
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.410
<v 0>What was that rest of the set? Like after you have to go back up there,</v>

53
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.070
what did you even do? Oh, you know, you just go.

54
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.360
<v 1>Hey, uh, every idea you had that could have been a bit, maybe one day,</v>

55
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:07.630
you just threw that out there and you're just counting the seconds. Like,

56
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.860
please let me be done. And uh, you know, you're like, Oh, look at that.

57
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.820
Elk's head on the wall. Hey, elk said, that's gotta suck. Oh, you're shot.

58
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.910
You're hung up on a wall. And my nerve in New York. Am I write books?

59
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.830
I don't want to be here when I'm alive. Yeah. Antlers. What about uncle ERs?

60
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.810
Ah, ah, hello.

61
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.280
He's just trying anything comedic in any kind of joke format,

62
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.690
anything you got pulled out of your and uh, Bob, where are you from here?

63
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.820
All right. Do you ever get out of here? No. Yeah. You got any dreams? No.

64
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.550
And you're like, all right, well, Bob's done. We're out with Bob. You know,

65
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.290
that's the whole, that was the whole thing. So it was tough.

66
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.490
<v 0>Good Lord. So,</v>

67
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.370
and do you remember when you got paid for that?

68
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.200
<v 1>I think it was, uh, I think it came out to like 25 bucks each.</v>

69
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.430
So the guy probably paid 75 total. Uh,

70
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.390
and when we did it, we knew, we said five hours for 25 bucks. We'll take it.

71
00:04:06.391 --> 00:04:10.680
I mean, it was so we were so new in the comedy that it was,

72
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.130
it was also an adventure like, Oh, let's go into this crazy town.

73
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.410
Let's get in the car, we'll get road beers.

74
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.720
We bought a case of beer and the car, you're listening to music.

75
00:04:18.721 --> 00:04:22.290
You're with your friends, we're going to sleep. There's going to be crazy. Holy.

76
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.360
A biker bar. So, you know, you're, you're 23 years old or 24 years old.

77
00:04:27.361 --> 00:04:29.970
So at the time it was like, this'll be, this'll be interesting.

78
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.970
<v 0>Oh my God, that is horrendous.</v>

79
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.430
<v 1>It was horrendous. And you know, still we laughed about it on the ride home.</v>

80
00:04:38.431 --> 00:04:40.620
It was a long five hours to get home hung over,

81
00:04:40.621 --> 00:04:44.640
but we had a fun time at the end of that. I mean, it was a story.

82
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.110
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I guess if you can look at it, that's the thing, like,</v>

83
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.000
it takes a long time to get to the point where you look at those and think,

84
00:04:54.001 --> 00:04:57.210
well, at least this will be a good story because when you're in that moment,

85
00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.770
all you're thinking is like,

86
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.020
I don't know if I'm going to be able to do comedy after this for me.

87
00:05:04.021 --> 00:05:07.050
Do you have any, like, I feel like for me,

88
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.010
I've had some shows where that drive back to wherever the hotel,

89
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.990
the condo, your house, whatever. It's like, you're just like, what, what did I,

90
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.910
who did I think I was to get into this business and have any of

91
00:05:20.911 --> 00:05:23.400
those shows that you're like on the edge? And you're like,

92
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.480
should I just be done?

93
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.050
<v 1>Uh, I guess I never really had a lot of that because I have no plan B you know,</v>

94
00:05:31.051 --> 00:05:34.680
it was just like, all right. Uh, that was a bad night.

95
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.240
And I was,

96
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.050
I knew I was in this for the long haul that I never really had a lot of that.

97
00:05:40.051 --> 00:05:44.100
Like I'm quitting, but I've had so many nights where I wanted to kill myself.

98
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.240
Like the, the, the,

99
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.930
the embarrassment and the affiliation was so bad that I'm like,

100
00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:51.840
I don't know how to stop feeling like this. So I just want to kill myself.

101
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.110
Or you just drown yourself in a bottle of bourbon. But, uh,

102
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.180
one time I did a college gig and Florida Kimra,

103
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.750
I think it was the school was Florida Atlantic. That was the name of the school.

104
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.740
And I was new college days were brand new. I was excited to get it good money.

105
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.620
You know, it was probably like 1200 bucks. But at the time you're like,

106
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.060
this is the best check I'll ever get in my life. And, uh, flew down there.

107
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:18.230
I landed like eight in the morning, took a cab straight to the college,

108
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.520
no hotel, no nothing. So I just walked around the college for literally,

109
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.010
you know, nine hours just bored. I had no money. I went to the food court,

110
00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:30.800
but I didn't have any money. I didn't have a credit card. I was such a piece of,

111
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.130
but I just walked around you. Then you see a water fountain. You're like,

112
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.930
Oh my God. Wow. You know, like, let's see what the gymnasium looks like. Let's,

113
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.830
let's walk around and look inside the classroom. It was, it was so bad.

114
00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:45.530
I got there way too early. And, uh,

115
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.790
finally the it's time for the gig. And I go in and the ladies like,

116
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.360
just want to let you know, it's very diverse. And it was all black.

117
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.080
Like I was the only white guy in the building. And I was like, it's not diverse.

118
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.260
Yeah. I'm diversity. I'm a diversity here. This is a predominance.

119
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.890
I think it was the word you're looking for or a hundred percent or whatever it

120
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:11.480
is. So I was like, all right. So it was me and this other guy.

121
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.710
And he was like a cute young, like nerdy black guy. And also,

122
00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:18.950
I remember the first act. It was like kind of a variety show.

123
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.720
And the first act was like a rap group spinning, like a towel around their head,

124
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:26.510
like jumping around. And they were like kill Whitey and all this.

125
00:07:26.511 --> 00:07:28.220
And I was like, ah, geez. You know,

126
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.180
and the first kid went up and we're supposed to do each do a half hour.

127
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.730
And the first kid goes up. He was like, let me go first.

128
00:07:34.731 --> 00:07:37.580
I want to get this over with we're we're trembling. And I was like, all right,

129
00:07:37.581 --> 00:07:41.150
whatever, you know, it. Go nuts. And he goes up and he must've done

130
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.700
five, six minutes total. They handled him so bad that he like,

131
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.660
tried to fight with him. And he tried to fight back and poke them and jab him.

132
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:54.650
And he couldn't, they just dominated him. And he just walked off and I was like,

133
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.360
what the? What are you crazy? Like, I didn't know. We could do that. Like,

134
00:07:59.361 --> 00:08:00.740
it blew my mind. I was just like,

135
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:04.130
I'm going to eat my for three 30 minutes and then I'll get my check.

136
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.430
But he just walked on. Like he had some dignity and some self-respect,

137
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:10.400
but that doesn't say that like,

138
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.520
cause did you have to fill his time or did you just do your 30?

139
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.270
I didn't have to fill his time, but it blew my mind that somebody would do that.

140
00:08:17.271 --> 00:08:19.730
Like, I didn't even think it didn't even cross my mind.

141
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.920
It wasn't even an option that you could just walk away.

142
00:08:21.921 --> 00:08:25.370
Like I thought this was your job. You got to, it's like a soldier. You got to,

143
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.880
you can't just run away from the army. You got to go towards him.

144
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:33.440
I didn't even think about that. It blew my mind. I'm just blown away.

145
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.800
And I actually, I think he went on second.

146
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.440
He went on second and did that that's that's right,

147
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.450
because that's why it blew my mind so much.

148
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.470
Cause I had just done a full half hour and he went on after me and was like,

149
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:50.180
this, this is crazy. You guys are nuts and I couldn't believe it.

150
00:08:50.181 --> 00:08:54.170
So I go on, let me tell you my story. So I, this is years ago.

151
00:08:54.171 --> 00:08:56.100
So I go on and uh,

152
00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:01.080
I go up and I walk to the microphone. And before I even say something,

153
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.650
this guy goes, look at this. And uh,

154
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:08.460
I'm in such a New York state of mind. I go, what if I was actually gay? Jeez.

155
00:09:08.461 --> 00:09:12.810
And he goes, no, no, you are. And learn. I mean,

156
00:09:12.811 --> 00:09:16.680
it was so well time, it got like a huge applause break.

157
00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:20.580
I had to wait for the last to die down just to, just to start again, you know?

158
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.080
And, uh, that was the beginning. That was like the first minute.

159
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.480
And then I had to just go from there and I don't think I did one bit,

160
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:33.120
it was just defense, defense, fighting back, getting heckled, fighting back,

161
00:09:33.121 --> 00:09:34.710
getting heckled for a half hour straight.

162
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.640
<v 0>My God. And then after that, so after that was your feeling, just like,</v>

163
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.870
well that was a bad one. Or were you thinking like,

164
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:49.100
I feel like I even know how it was going to leave the college.

165
00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.310
<v 1>It was a Tyson fight. It was like, Oh my God.</v>

166
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.940
I was like in the corner after like, Oh my God. I mean,

167
00:09:56.941 --> 00:10:01.580
I got beat up like a ragdoll and I felt like a teacher in a bad

168
00:10:01.581 --> 00:10:03.590
school. And like one of those movies, you know,

169
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.810
where I couldn't even control the class.

170
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:09.830
And that's why when that kid went on after and did six minutes, I was like,

171
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.850
Oh my God, why didn't I do that? Right. Because he still got paid.

172
00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.850
<v 0>Yeah. Holy Christ.</v>

173
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.010
<v 1>Yeah. So that, but that was one of those, like,</v>

174
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.220
I dunno where I stayed that night, but I flew back the next morning.

175
00:10:22.221 --> 00:10:25.040
I was just like, woo. That was what I thought that was part of it.

176
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:29.060
Like in my mind where we're kind of so lucky to do comedy that I was just like,

177
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.290
all right. That was a bad gig. And what's next. But you still get paid.

178
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:37.310
<v 0>Yeah. You still get paid. And like you said, especially early on,</v>

179
00:10:37.311 --> 00:10:38.690
like when you start doing those colleges,

180
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.850
it's the most money you've ever received. Yeah.

181
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.930
<v 1>Yes. And I was so dumb. I probably thought that was part of it. Like,</v>

182
00:10:44.931 --> 00:10:48.000
no wonder you get paid a ton, you have to eat your for an hour. Right.

183
00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:52.310
<v 0>And if people don't do a college show,</v>

184
00:10:52.311 --> 00:10:56.000
they don't realize that they're nine times out of 10. They're not set up. Well,

185
00:10:56.001 --> 00:11:00.800
it's like during lunch in a cafeteria it's in between classes or

186
00:11:00.801 --> 00:11:05.360
something. And they're like, all right. And it's usually no intro,

187
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.990
no ho it's like, go ahead, go.

188
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:10.910
You know?

189
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.680
<v 1>Yeah, exactly. Exactly.</v>

190
00:11:12.681 --> 00:11:15.920
And I remember pizzas were being passed around while that was going on.

191
00:11:15.921 --> 00:11:19.370
So you try to riff on the pizza and I don't think I'll eat the last slice,

192
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.750
but you hate that guy. Oh boy. And that none of that was flying at all. And uh,

193
00:11:23.751 --> 00:11:27.110
yeah, the whole thing was horrific, but yeah, you just,

194
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:29.360
you can't say no to a college gig and I figured, Hey,

195
00:11:29.361 --> 00:11:31.970
you have a bad gig every now and then. And I don't know,

196
00:11:31.971 --> 00:11:35.570
it hurt my feelings and it was humiliating, but I never was like, I'm quitting.

197
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:38.600
Yeah. Would have never crossed my mind.

198
00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:43.190
<v 0>What did what's like your a after a bomb after a bad show, vice, like,</v>

199
00:11:43.191 --> 00:11:45.200
do you have anything to you do to cope?

200
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:49.880
<v 1>Well, I used to be the guy everybody hates that has to talk about it.</v>

201
00:11:49.881 --> 00:11:53.650
And I'm like, Oh, that was so bad. That sucked that I had to like vent about it.

202
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.760
And I I've seen that guy since and we all go, yes, it was bad.

203
00:11:57.761 --> 00:12:00.310
And I know you just want me to like, come for you right now,

204
00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:01.480
but I don't want to,

205
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:05.650
so I try not to be that guy anymore because I saw a guy do it and we all hate

206
00:12:05.651 --> 00:12:10.090
that guy. So I just, I just drink. Oh, that's good.

207
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.560
Yeah. Yeah. Big booze guy. And I walk, I'm a big Walker.

208
00:12:14.561 --> 00:12:15.640
Like after that bomber,

209
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:20.200
I remember walking around the college for awhile and just hating myself and

210
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.540
replaying it and thinking, what can you do different?

211
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.060
It's it's very much like a fist fight that you lost. You know, you're just like,

212
00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:28.750
Oh, if I had punched him here and I could've ducked there and all that. Uh,

213
00:12:28.751 --> 00:12:29.650
so it's a lot of that.

214
00:12:29.651 --> 00:12:34.300
Like maybe if I had said this or said that and just replaying it and

215
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.180
retracing the steps of, of hell.

216
00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.270
<v 2>It's the worst thing to do.</v>

217
00:12:39.271 --> 00:12:42.150
You're you're essentially just jerk storing yourself from

218
00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:46.500
a lot of that here. Just like the whole time. You're like,

219
00:12:46.501 --> 00:12:50.700
if I would've said this and it does you no good. No, it's over.

220
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.490
It just upsets you that you didn't say it then.

221
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:58.290
<v 1>Yes. Yes. But I will say nothing will prepare you for the next one.</v>

222
00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:02.750
Like actually going through it all the way, because yeah. You'll,

223
00:13:02.751 --> 00:13:06.780
you'll never learn how to deal with that. If you don't experience it,

224
00:13:06.781 --> 00:13:09.450
like bill Burr is probably one of the better comics that he could handle.

225
00:13:09.451 --> 00:13:12.690
Any penny, any moment. I mean, look at Philly,

226
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.810
they arena booed him and he handled that beautifully.

227
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.950
So how many hell gigs did he go through to get to that? You know?

228
00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:25.080
<v 2>Yeah. And widget, which kind of made it, you know, like, yes,</v>

229
00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.760
the deal for him that he was not to be messed with. And that he was like legit,

230
00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:30.840
right?

231
00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:35.100
<v 1>Like as a comic doing sets and writing, that's like hitting the punching bag.</v>

232
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.400
But until you go get your kicked by a crowd,

233
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:42.990
you'll never know what it's like to be in a real fight. Like,

234
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:46.080
cause you need the actual guy swinging at you. You know,

235
00:13:46.081 --> 00:13:47.340
you can do the writing all day,

236
00:13:47.341 --> 00:13:50.040
but you need the guys looking at your face to know when to duck.

237
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.540
<v 2>Yeah. That's a great way to put that now. Like,</v>

238
00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:59.040
so just because time has passed, you know, you're farther along in comedy.

239
00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:04.200
Sometimes you still get some shows that you don't see coming. Like for me,

240
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:05.460
some of the worst bombs are like,

241
00:14:05.461 --> 00:14:09.870
when things are going really well and then all, and you're just like,

242
00:14:09.871 --> 00:14:13.440
this is great. I'm so funny. This is why I got into this business.

243
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:14.880
Of course I'll be famous.

244
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:19.470
And then out of nowhere you get the left hook and it completely just knocks you

245
00:14:19.471 --> 00:14:20.460
off your pedestal.

246
00:14:20.461 --> 00:14:24.160
Do you have any of those where like you're riding high or you're,

247
00:14:24.161 --> 00:14:26.070
you're far enough into your career where you're like,

248
00:14:26.071 --> 00:14:28.290
I got this and then they pull the rug out from you?

249
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.610
<v 1>Well, well two things, one, um,</v>

250
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.930
I've had the thing where I was killing so hard and I had like great momentum.

251
00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:41.280
And then I S then the lady heckled me and I said something so mean that they

252
00:14:41.281 --> 00:14:42.114
turned on me.

253
00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:47.520
I was at the Hartford funny bone and there was, uh, it was, you know,

254
00:14:47.521 --> 00:14:52.160
it was like half full. Maybe, maybe it was probably a third full. And um,

255
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:56.210
but I'm kinda, I'm kinda coasting. Like I'm, I'm coasting well on that.

256
00:14:56.211 --> 00:14:59.840
Like I don't give a. Look, it's the third full I'm at the Hartford funny bone.

257
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:04.130
It's the third show on a Saturday. I don't give a about you.

258
00:15:04.131 --> 00:15:08.210
You don't give a about me. And I had that. I don't give a confidence. You know,

259
00:15:08.211 --> 00:15:10.610
that w when you don't truly don't care about the show,

260
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.960
you're really in your best element. Yeah. You know what I mean? I was in,

261
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.960
you know, I wasn't having the best set of my life,

262
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:22.100
but I didn't give a and it showed, and I think it was working. So,

263
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:26.570
uh, I was kind of doing well and I was feeling good about it.

264
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:31.190
And this table in the front row kept with me. And it was a fat guy,

265
00:15:31.191 --> 00:15:33.590
like a really fat, obese nerdy guy.

266
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:38.900
And it was a handicap chick with the crutches, like the two arm crutches,

267
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:43.540
you know, like, uh, some, something about Mary Guy. And,

268
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:47.570
and then like a chick who was so unattractive that you could tell this was,

269
00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.580
this is like, as David tell, would say, this,

270
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:53.390
this team would be called the unfuckable. You know, it was like,

271
00:15:53.391 --> 00:15:56.840
the bed was just a bunch of gross unattractive,

272
00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:01.040
traditionally unattractive people hanging out and they had a bone to pick with

273
00:16:01.041 --> 00:16:04.250
the comic. So they just kept with me.

274
00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:08.630
And eventually I just snapped. I snapped because, you know, you're kind of like,

275
00:16:08.631 --> 00:16:12.380
look, I'm having a decent set. The place is barely got any people in it. Uh,

276
00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:15.710
just, just ride it out. Don't worry about them. But they kept,

277
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.980
it was like a gnat when they kept saying little things and they're on the front

278
00:16:18.981 --> 00:16:22.640
row. So only I could hear it and know nobody in the back knew.

279
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.800
So it was one of those, you got to be like, Hey, will you shut up?

280
00:16:24.801 --> 00:16:28.310
And people were like, what's he? Why is he yelling at that triple? You know?

281
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:32.000
Like, know why is he all at the fed? But whatever.

282
00:16:32.001 --> 00:16:35.390
So eventually I just snapped on these people and I was like, you,

283
00:16:35.391 --> 00:16:40.250
you ugly come juggling bitten, honked at, Oh, Hey, look at this.

284
00:16:40.251 --> 00:16:45.200
Just show list, driving by. Hold on, look at that. I'm doing a zoom here.

285
00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.370
This is my zoom spot. This is Colin Chamberlain.

286
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.990
He's a comic in Pittsburgh. There's Joe, listen, Sarah. Hey.

287
00:16:56.270 --> 00:17:01.040
All right. I'll be done in one. What are we like? 20 minutes? Yeah. 10. 10.

288
00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:05.810
All right. Sorry about that. So how weird is that?

289
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:10.160
It's so weird to see somebody in my neighborhood with COVID. Uh, yeah.

290
00:17:10.161 --> 00:17:13.700
So I just snap on this table. I'm just like, you're all gross.

291
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:14.690
Nobody wants to you.

292
00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.590
And it got so bad and this has never happened to me before or since,

293
00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:23.570
but this guy in the back goes, Hey, lay off. And I'm like, you.

294
00:17:23.571 --> 00:17:25.910
They're heckling me. And I lost it on him now. Cause I'm like, well,

295
00:17:25.911 --> 00:17:28.880
you're defending that. They're the bad guys. What are you doing? And he goes,

296
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:34.040
I brought 10 people here to see you. I saw you on Conan. I was a fan.

297
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:38.150
And now I hate you. And we're all leaving. And I'm like,

298
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:43.550
what the is going on? You're you're a fan or a supposed fan.

299
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.860
And you brought 10 people and now you're leaving.

300
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:48.950
Cause I'm heckling someone who's heckling the guy you like. And I,

301
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.230
I just broke this whole thing down was like, do you see how crazy this is?

302
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:57.590
And it just got so weird and Shakespearian and tangled

303
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:58.350
that there. Now,

304
00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:01.980
now 10 people are leaving and the fat guy stands up and I thought he was going

305
00:18:01.981 --> 00:18:06.660
to come at me. And I was like, you, you're a Virgin. Like, I'm not a tough guy,

306
00:18:06.661 --> 00:18:09.300
but I was like, I can take this guy. This guy is fat as.

307
00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.630
And he's never been a fight in his life. I can take them. And I was ready.

308
00:18:12.631 --> 00:18:15.300
I was so keyed up. So now I got 10 people leaving.

309
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.850
I got a fat guy in the front row, just like,

310
00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:21.180
like chest to the stage or like waist to the stage,

311
00:18:21.181 --> 00:18:23.580
like yelling up at me and I'm yelling down at him.

312
00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:27.540
And then his dumb skank ladies are, or ugly. Horrors are yelling at me.

313
00:18:27.541 --> 00:18:30.690
So I'm yelling at them. And now this guy's leaving the managers in the back,

314
00:18:30.691 --> 00:18:32.910
talking to people, trying to keep them, keep them here.

315
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.060
And then the whole thing just went off the rails and everybody left.

316
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.550
<v 0>Like inside of a riot.</v>

317
00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:43.260
<v 1>I kind of did, but I mean, I lost it on this guy because he just kept going.</v>

318
00:18:43.261 --> 00:18:47.490
And the guy, the guy defended the fact guy, it was insane.

319
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:52.740
But I mean, I felt like so alone up there for the first time, you know,

320
00:18:52.741 --> 00:18:56.640
like as Academy, you're very alone, but I felt incredibly alone.

321
00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.760
The entire crowd turned on me. I mean, some people were just like,

322
00:18:59.761 --> 00:19:01.260
this is crazy. This is fun to watch.

323
00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:05.760
But now it felt like the whole crowd hated me and my back's against the wall.

324
00:19:05.761 --> 00:19:09.690
And I'm the only guy yelling back at them. It was wild. It was a wild scene.

325
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:13.110
Hold still my best set at the Hartford funny book.

326
00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:16.520
<v 0>That's a, that is a rough club.</v>

327
00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:21.920
<v 1>Yeah, it was rough. I mean, these were papered rooms, paper tickets.</v>

328
00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.250
Nobody wanted to see me. Nobody knew who I was except for this,

329
00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:29.420
apparently this old guy with 10 friends. But yeah, it was tough.

330
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:34.150
<v 0>My God. Did you, uh, did you have another one? I, I,</v>

331
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.570
I didn't want to know.

332
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.720
<v 1>I have one. I have one more, but it's kind of, I've told it before,</v>

333
00:19:38.721 --> 00:19:42.350
but I'll just, I'll I'll uh, I'll knock it out on this one. Just cause it's,

334
00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:47.270
it's so on theme. But uh, I did a set at the seller once. Great set.

335
00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.740
And this guy comes up in a business suit and he was like, Hey, uh,

336
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:53.030
that was a great set.

337
00:19:53.031 --> 00:19:56.360
I was wondering why you got some edge to your home and you got some darkness.

338
00:19:56.390 --> 00:20:01.100
I was wondering if you'd come to my come upstate or come a long Island and roast

339
00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:05.180
a bunch of my hedge fund people. And I was like, yeah, sure. And he's like,

340
00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:07.970
I'll give you five grand. I was like, Oh my God, five grand. I'll do,

341
00:20:07.971 --> 00:20:10.640
I didn't even reply grant. So he's like, all right, give me your email.

342
00:20:10.641 --> 00:20:13.850
We'll connect. I'm like, all right. So I got the email.

343
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.800
He sends me a rap sheet. Oh, hang on.

344
00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:22.880
He sends me a loose, okay. Sorry. My phone rang.

345
00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:28.100
He sent me a rap sheet of dirt on the, all the clients.

346
00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.430
And this was like heavy stuff. But he kept being like being brutal, be harsh.

347
00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:35.060
Don't hold back. Like they can take it whatever. And I'm like, all right.

348
00:20:35.061 --> 00:20:37.670
All right. So, I mean, this was heavy stuff like this.

349
00:20:37.671 --> 00:20:38.780
Guy's cheating on his wife,

350
00:20:38.781 --> 00:20:42.770
this guy's addicted to blow this guy's a secretly gay or in the closet or

351
00:20:42.771 --> 00:20:45.560
whatever. And I was like, Oh wow, I'm going to rip this room apart.

352
00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:46.820
I guess the best dirt.

353
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:52.030
So I get the address instead of golf course, a long time. This is like,

354
00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:56.380
heavy-duty rich people, Epstein chip. These are rich, rich.

355
00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:01.230
Manhattanites so whatever. So I get on the train. I, uh,

356
00:21:01.231 --> 00:21:05.080
I'm feeling pretty good. I got my notes. I got my piece of paper. I'm all ready.

357
00:21:05.081 --> 00:21:09.270
I got my cue cards. So I show up and it's just like the, the,

358
00:21:09.271 --> 00:21:13.780
the parking lot is like Ferrari femur, Lexus Maserati, you know,

359
00:21:13.781 --> 00:21:17.770
Lamborghini, Porsche. It's crazy. So I'm like, wow, this is, uh,

360
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:20.830
some high end stuff here I get in there. It's it's uh,

361
00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:25.600
it's like the banquet room of a golf club. And it's two white tablecloths,

362
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:28.120
like all these, the waiters and white jackets.

363
00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:32.260
And they got the cloth over the arm and the metal tray and the whole thing.

364
00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.550
And I'm like, Oh my God.

365
00:21:33.551 --> 00:21:36.460
So I find the guy and it's out of a movie sitting in the back,

366
00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:39.880
patio smoking a big Stokey and he's like, Oh, you're here.

367
00:21:39.881 --> 00:21:43.930
He's got that Ascot going. Like, the whole thing was crazy. So it was like, Oh,

368
00:21:43.931 --> 00:21:46.960
Hey. He's like, Hey, you got your stuff. This is gonna be so fun. Like,

369
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.350
let him have it, let it rip. Don't hold back. I was like, you got it.

370
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.260
So he's like, I'm going to go up to the podium. I'm going to do a few minutes,

371
00:21:53.261 --> 00:21:56.680
you know, thanking everybody for coming. We'll the house cleaning.

372
00:21:56.681 --> 00:22:00.070
And then you come up and do your thing and I'm going to give you a whole 45

373
00:22:00.071 --> 00:22:05.020
minutes. I was like, all right, you got it. So, uh,

374
00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:08.380
he does his thing. I go on and I'm pretty excited. I'm like,

375
00:22:08.381 --> 00:22:11.110
I got some good stuff. He wasn't funny.

376
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:16.330
And this crowd was ready to laugh and uh, I'm going to bring the heat. So,

377
00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.460
and he's paying me well. So, uh,

378
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.000
I go up there and I do the mic dude. You know,

379
00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:26.410
the feedback happens just at a movie and I go up and I just go right into it.

380
00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:29.920
I go, Hey, where's, where's Bob where's Bob. And it starts off very friendly.

381
00:22:29.921 --> 00:22:33.220
Where am I was like Bobby, Bobby, you know, one guy gets you in a headlock,

382
00:22:33.221 --> 00:22:36.160
you know, homies over here. And Bobby puts his hand up. He's all nervous.

383
00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:41.020
And uh, and then at this point I realized everyone there has children with them.

384
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:43.720
Like the kids are there, not everyone,

385
00:22:43.721 --> 00:22:46.360
but there was a couple of people with kids. And I was like, well, that's weird.

386
00:22:46.361 --> 00:22:48.910
But yeah, you know what? I got my stuff.

387
00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:52.420
I was told about the whole back here it comes. So,

388
00:22:52.421 --> 00:22:55.840
and their wives are there too. So I'm like, all right, I go, Hey, Bob,

389
00:22:55.841 --> 00:22:58.540
we all know you were addicted to Coke. Yeah. Everybody knows.

390
00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:02.410
You're doing it at the office. You got a problem. You need rehab there.

391
00:23:02.411 --> 00:23:06.040
You can't fool us. And it just silence. And he's like,

392
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:10.000
Oh no, no. You know now. And like some other guys,

393
00:23:10.001 --> 00:23:14.800
like I knew you were on, you're done whatever.

394
00:23:14.801 --> 00:23:18.100
And I'm like, Oh, and I th so I think he just got fired immediately,

395
00:23:18.101 --> 00:23:21.010
but like two people started going at it with Bob and that got ugly.

396
00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:25.840
And I was like, well, let me change it up. So I go, Hey, Hey Reggie, Hey,

397
00:23:25.841 --> 00:23:29.820
Reggie, we all know you're cheating on your wife. And she was, she was there.

398
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:33.910
She was like in front of her kids.

399
00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:39.160
She gets up those, the napkin Adam. He's like, no, no, honey. I swear to God.

400
00:23:39.161 --> 00:23:43.330
I swear to God. I mean the whole thing's bananas. So then I go, all right, well,

401
00:23:43.331 --> 00:23:48.110
let me move on again. Let's try number three, Hey, cliff Cliffy.

402
00:23:48.111 --> 00:23:51.620
And Cliff's like, Oh. I mean, he's terrified now. And clips. I'm like,

403
00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:55.610
Hey cliff, we all know you're gay. Just coming out already. Nobody cares.

404
00:23:55.611 --> 00:24:00.350
You make home all that. And he's like, Oh my God. He's like,

405
00:24:00.351 --> 00:24:03.120
don't do this to me my whole life. But all, you know, so,

406
00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:06.740
so basically the whole place is in shambles. Napkins are flying up.

407
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:10.310
Tables are getting turned over. Fist fights, drinks are spilled. You know,

408
00:24:10.311 --> 00:24:14.510
women are screaming, babies are crying. And uh, I go, well,

409
00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:18.290
I'll just go into my act. You know? So I go into my act. I'm like, Uber's weird.

410
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:23.510
You guys ever take Uber. A banana is hard to peel. Ah,

411
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.620
you guys ever get a haircut, you know? And it's just silence,

412
00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:31.730
just fighting and anger. And eventually the guy's doing this in the back,

413
00:24:31.731 --> 00:24:35.930
like get off, get off. And then he did the, you know, so I walk off and it's,

414
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:40.370
it was horrific. Uh, I walk up and he does the thing where he's like,

415
00:24:40.371 --> 00:24:44.750
what happened out there? That was awful. They hated you. Oh my God.

416
00:24:44.751 --> 00:24:47.360
You know how much work I'm going to do to clean up that mess you piece of.

417
00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:49.880
I'm like, you told me not to hold back.

418
00:24:49.881 --> 00:24:53.210
And that was my first lesson in when they say don't hold back.

419
00:24:53.211 --> 00:24:57.560
That doesn't mean it they're full of. So it's funny.

420
00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:01.540
<v 2>I think they know about comedy when they're booking comedy,</v>

421
00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:06.400
you know, do you ever get this? Like in a club? It's like, Hey,

422
00:25:06.401 --> 00:25:08.260
could you tell him it's his birthday?

423
00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:14.290
<v 1>Oh yeah. Applebee's you know, I know I still get that. I still get that.</v>

424
00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:18.910
It's crazy. It's it's beyond, it's beyond,

425
00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:21.820
it's beyond me. How much people don't know about comedy?

426
00:25:21.821 --> 00:25:24.430
Like you would never go into a guy at, at Hamilton and be like, Hey,

427
00:25:24.431 --> 00:25:27.400
tell him it's my birthday. And the guy's like, I was supposed to be Aaron Burr.

428
00:25:27.401 --> 00:25:31.510
You can get outta here, you know? But, uh, but yeah, it was bad.

429
00:25:31.511 --> 00:25:33.850
And I had to fight to get that check. I remember, I was like, dude,

430
00:25:33.851 --> 00:25:37.480
you told me not to hold back. I did the you gave me, sorry,

431
00:25:37.481 --> 00:25:42.380
hang on a fire truck. And he's like, nah, no,

432
00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:44.800
that was bad. That was bad. I thought you were funny. He kept,

433
00:25:44.801 --> 00:25:47.740
he was pretty mean. He was like a mean guys. I thought you were funny. What the.

434
00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.930
If I knew that was going to happen, I would have never hired you.

435
00:25:49.931 --> 00:25:51.670
I'm like you told me not to hold back.

436
00:25:51.671 --> 00:25:54.460
I'm like fighting with this guy on the patio and he's like, fine here.

437
00:25:54.461 --> 00:25:58.390
Get out of my sight. He gave me the check and I left. Wow. Holy.

438
00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:00.490
Yeah. Pretty wild.

439
00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:05.770
<v 2>Out. We'll wrap up with this story here because it was, uh,</v>

440
00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:10.270
something I got to witness and it was before I moved to New York,

441
00:26:10.271 --> 00:26:14.140
I was still living in Pittsburgh and I would work with you and Chris Allen at

442
00:26:14.141 --> 00:26:17.200
the improv. Yes, you did it.

443
00:26:17.201 --> 00:26:20.620
You did the joke about, Oh, I forgot about this

444
00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:24.250
total Jews in an Uber. Right?

445
00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:27.610
What's what's like what's causing all this traffic and like probably the Jews

446
00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.930
and it got real quiet and,

447
00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:35.290
and you, you started doing a little riffing on it.

448
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:39.490
And then later to find out there was a shooting at a synagogue, um,

449
00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:45.720
uh, right before you Pittsburgh and a lady came up to you,

450
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:49.890
furious. Like the whole show is going well.

451
00:26:49.891 --> 00:26:54.660
And sometime you have a great show and it's one person, one moment the ruins it.

452
00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.420
And it's the audacity did that.

453
00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:00.960
She would think that not only did you know about the shooting,

454
00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:04.860
but knowing about it, you would try to make fun of it.

455
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:07.110
Like you very clearly just didn't hear it.

456
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:13.370
<v 1>No, I know. I know. Oh, I knew about it, but I was like, I just jokes in my act.</v>

457
00:27:13.371 --> 00:27:17.060
I'm doing it. And you like tragedies.

458
00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:19.970
I feel like are meant to be joked about in a way,

459
00:27:19.971 --> 00:27:23.870
because it's how it makes you feel better. You got to make a laugh out of it.

460
00:27:23.871 --> 00:27:27.830
You know? So I knew what I was doing, but I, I wasn't like, these people.

461
00:27:27.831 --> 00:27:28.521
I was just like, Oh,

462
00:27:28.521 --> 00:27:32.430
I made a Jew joke and that's awkward because of the times we're living in, uh,

463
00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:34.310
if you know what I mean, you know, I wasn't,

464
00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.130
I wasn't saying like they deserve to die or whatever.

465
00:27:37.131 --> 00:27:41.930
I just made a joke about what happened. Kind of, I acknowledged what happened.

466
00:27:41.931 --> 00:27:45.620
That was it. And she flipped. I forgot all about that.

467
00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:50.090
<v 2>Yeah. She was horrible, horrible woman.</v>

468
00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:52.070
And you know,

469
00:27:52.071 --> 00:27:56.870
I guess to wrap up when you have that experience of someone coming after you,

470
00:27:56.871 --> 00:28:01.370
either dark show after show, how do you, you know,

471
00:28:01.371 --> 00:28:03.590
there's part of you that wants to just unload,

472
00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:08.240
but you kind of gotta be a little bit reserved and lose the whole thing.

473
00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:10.100
How do you go through that for you?

474
00:28:10.101 --> 00:28:14.750
What is your process of like dealing with this one issue and trying to get back

475
00:28:14.751 --> 00:28:17.630
to either a good evening, a good show or a second show?

476
00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:19.850
<v 1>I think, uh, I've been,</v>

477
00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:23.600
it's happened to me so much that I just kind of go to a happy place. And I,

478
00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:27.230
I used to try to reason with them, which is the worst thing you can do,

479
00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:32.000
because these are like, I guess for lack of a better term, these are Terrans,

480
00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:36.380
you know, these are just like older white women who want to yell at somebody.

481
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:40.730
But, uh, I used to be like, no, no, I'm man. I'm, I'm a comedian. It's Joe,

482
00:28:40.731 --> 00:28:43.280
I didn't shoot anybody. Like these are words,

483
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:47.600
we're all gonna die one day and this is crazy, you know? But uh, now I just go,

484
00:28:47.601 --> 00:28:52.370
I know you're I know it's crazy that that was a mistake. I'll never do it again.

485
00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:57.200
I've learned a lesson. Thanks to you. You have changed me.

486
00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:59.150
Thank God you spoke up. I did with Fallon,

487
00:28:59.151 --> 00:29:03.290
did I thank them for calling out my black face and, uh.

488
00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.020
<v 2>Which was pretty, pretty crazy move.</v>

489
00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:09.380
<v 1>That was, that was a bummer. That was gross and weird.</v>

490
00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.750
Yeah. I just go in and I go, yes, ma'am you're right. You're right.

491
00:29:14.751 --> 00:29:18.560
Because I just want to end the thing and then she can go back to her dumb cats

492
00:29:18.561 --> 00:29:20.540
and go, ah, yeah, I showed him,

493
00:29:20.541 --> 00:29:24.790
I taught a guy a lesson tonight and then she'll dialogue, but either way,

494
00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.630
just suck it up and move on.

495
00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:29.540
<v 2>Yeah. Well, Mark, I appreciate doing this.</v>
