1
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:07.280
<v 0>Hello.</v>

2
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.600
<v 1>Hello everyone. Welcome to what we call hot breath live.</v>

3
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.853
<v 0>Maybe</v>

4
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.733
quick.

5
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.320
<v 1>This is perfect. This is how we're going to go viral.</v>

6
00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:22.730
This is our big break people.

7
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.410
<v 0>Brown. What's the tiny penis.</v>

8
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.090
No.

9
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.870
<v 1>Come on. I've listened to Tuesdays with stories. I know the deal.</v>

10
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.840
So people in the comments that is a great ice breaker. Uh,

11
00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:46.970
so you don't have to ask that question anymore.

12
00:00:46.971 --> 00:00:50.660
Don't ask Mark how big his penis is. He just told us. So, uh,

13
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.670
go ahead and start commenting with it, with your questions. And,

14
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.720
uh, we're going to get this going, but I have to ask you first, uh, Mark,

15
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.330
um, you,

16
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.350
you told a lot of cool stories about your work with Seinfeld in terms of like

17
00:01:06.351 --> 00:01:09.170
the behind the scenes stuff, but you know,

18
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.990
hot breath is like a comedy education show.

19
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.730
And I'd be wondering what you learned from more of like the craft side or how he

20
00:01:16.731 --> 00:01:20.060
operated that you've kind of applied to what you do now.

21
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.560
<v 0>Good question there for that age, I would say he's a,</v>

22
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.620
he's such a workhorse. He's too.

23
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.140
It's almost a perfectionist to a fault where it's,

24
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.300
it takes them a while to make new material,

25
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.670
because he's such a nut about the meticulous wording and the choices and the

26
00:01:40.671 --> 00:01:43.850
order and everything. So in a way it's almost a flaw,

27
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.590
but it's also what makes this material so great. So, uh,

28
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.090
what I learned was he had this great thing about writing because nobody likes to

29
00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:57.140
write. It's a pain in the. It sucks. But he said, if you turn the music off,

30
00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.200
turn the TV off, put the phone away and just stare at an idea.

31
00:02:00.201 --> 00:02:01.220
You think is funny.

32
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.710
Your brain will get so miserable that it'll have to crack the code on it.

33
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.120
Does that make sense? Huh? You know, like if you're stuck in a room,

34
00:02:11.121 --> 00:02:14.000
you'll find something to do because your brain doesn't want to be bored.

35
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.720
So if you stare at a joke for a long enough, like the premise,

36
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.500
and then you have the feeling of like, all right, this sucks.

37
00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:23.960
I want to go do something else. If you hang in there,

38
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.440
your brain will get so bored. It will make it happen. It will make it work.

39
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.160
<v 1>We'll just like physically sit there and stare at it,</v>

40
00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:33.110
like written on the page type deal.

41
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.370
<v 0>Totally. Yeah. And every fiber of your being says,</v>

42
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.880
pull-out jerk up, watch TV go gay,

43
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.160
but you stick with it and your brain will come up with something fascinating.

44
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.180
And if you look at as material, you can see that he did that.

45
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.070
He's got this joke about golf. I don't wanna give away his material,

46
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.640
but he's like golf. I don't understand golf. You know why guys go golf?

47
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.850
Cause I need to be alone. That's what golf stands for. Go out. Leave.

48
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.353
It's a funny joke.

49
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.050
But you can tell he came up with that joke from just staring at the Gulf,

50
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.370
that word Gol F. And that's how he got there. Very cool.

51
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:12.910
So that you'll do that. Now I try. I mean,

52
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:17.830
I'm not as disciplined as him cause uh, you know, I got, I got all these toys.

53
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:21.940
I got a moped. I got a, I got a lady naked next to me, you know? So it's hard,

54
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:25.900
but he's a 65 year old Jew and he's willing to do it.

55
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.570
<v 1>Yeah. This actually, uh, can go into the first question from Charlie Harper.</v>

56
00:03:30.571 --> 00:03:34.020
You brought up Jews. Mark. What's your favorite Jewish?

57
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.510
<v 0>Mm, well, I mean, I got to go to the source. I got to go Groucho</v>

58
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.360
Groucho, Larry David there's somewhere some, a neck and neck,

59
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.230
great neck and neck with those two. So, uh,

60
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.810
I guess I go lyric because he's a lie, but the all time,

61
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.950
or is a big old Julius Marx Groucho.

62
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.690
<v 1>Yeah. That's a, you have him as your Twitter header photo too with the,</v>

63
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:00.653
with the gals.

64
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.960
<v 0>Oh yeah, that's right. Yeah. He just so funny.</v>

65
00:04:03.961 --> 00:04:07.410
He was the first guy to do it that way and just joke after joke.

66
00:04:07.411 --> 00:04:10.860
And he's Woody Allen and bill Cosby's idle,

67
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.900
which changes over the years, but, uh, that's pretty good,

68
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:21.540
but he's the quickest guy. So here's a couple of two quick Groucho lines.

69
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.480
One is he's direct is directing a movie,

70
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.800
some guys directly his name's Andy wood and they go, Hey, will you get scrubbed?

71
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.160
Your kept cutting up. And he goes, look, I can't make that actress out of clay.

72
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.360
And he goes, well, apparently it can't make directors out of wood. Pretty quick.

73
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.180
Second. He was at a bar,

74
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.560
a restaurant in LA and a priest comes up to him and goes, Mr. Grouch,

75
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.900
I don't want to bother you. And he's eating a bowl of soup and he goes,

76
00:04:45.901 --> 00:04:46.501
I don't wanna bother you,

77
00:04:46.501 --> 00:04:50.160
but I just want to thank you for putting so much joy into the world and Groucho

78
00:04:50.161 --> 00:04:52.860
looks up and goes. I just want to thank you for taking so much out.

79
00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.060
Come on quick, quick gobbledy. Indeed.

80
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.030
<v 1>This question, Dylan. O'Neill, um,</v>

81
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.680
who's actually a Toronto comedian by way of Ireland. So,

82
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.230
um, he wonders how much of the greats have you studied

83
00:05:13.231 --> 00:05:15.540
and how do you break their sets down?

84
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.680
<v 0>Hmm. Ooh. Well, studied is a tough question. I mean, I've watched everything,</v>

85
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.360
what's it all a Carla and watch all a Pryor. You name it, but uh,

86
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.120
I don't know about study. That's a good question.

87
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.790
I guess it's just watching counter study. Yeah.

88
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.210
<v 1>Yeah. I think that's what he means by study is like you're watching,</v>

89
00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:39.840
but when you're watching a comedian, how are you analyzing them?

90
00:05:39.841 --> 00:05:41.040
What are you looking for?

91
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.010
<v 0>Well, there's a lot of the Everly here aligning.</v>

92
00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:45.690
It gets a huge laugh and you go, why to take it.

93
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.500
Or even you say a line on stage go, why did that click? That?

94
00:05:49.501 --> 00:05:51.930
Wasn't what I intended to laugh, but that got a laugh.

95
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.850
So I think with stuff like that,

96
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.070
you got to just sit there and just break it down.

97
00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.350
And that's kind of is magical because sometimes you just can't figure it out.

98
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.150
<v 1>So you're like, you hear a laugh and you're always wondering why,</v>

99
00:06:04.151 --> 00:06:07.490
what did they do? Is it what they said? Or is it how they said it?

100
00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.410
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. Cause usually go that got a laugh.</v>

101
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.610
Cause it was a misdirect or it was a pun or you thought I was going to say this.

102
00:06:15.611 --> 00:06:16.330
He said that.

103
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.980
But sometimes it's just a funny thing in a funny rhythm and it just tickles that

104
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:22.443
taint.

105
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.190
<v 1>Well, how are you able to evoke laugh in your own certain style?</v>

106
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.740
Cause Dylan actually had a little follow-up detail of I'd love to know his

107
00:06:29.741 --> 00:06:34.600
process because his jokes are so quick and sharp and easy to follow and the

108
00:06:34.601 --> 00:06:35.434
punchlines are good.

109
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.960
<v 0>Wow. Well, I'm being honest. I have zero faith in the audience.</v>

110
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:46.420
I assume audience is, they're all incredibly unfunny and incredibly dumb.

111
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.190
And I have to,

112
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.060
I spell out every joke because there's other words worse than having a great

113
00:06:52.061 --> 00:06:55.240
idea and then them not getting it.

114
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.330
So you got to make them understand it, you know?

115
00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.800
So I say it over and over a million times and I just keep trying to simplify,

116
00:07:02.801 --> 00:07:07.210
simplify, simplify, and take out everything you don't need and shorten it up.

117
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.700
Cause I also have no faith in people's attention span.

118
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.450
So it's just years of hammering it through like a,

119
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.020
a funny filter or a simple filter.

120
00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.170
<v 1>Is there a TV on or.</v>

121
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.120
<v 0>Oh, I see. Where does your gal in there watching?</v>

122
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:27.040
Oh yeah.

123
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.600
<v 1>Well, don't worry about it. I don't want to,</v>

124
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.010
I don't want to block you for later.

125
00:07:30.011 --> 00:07:34.210
She's gonna be like you did that silly podcast and they tell, and I actually,

126
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.800
I don't know if that's how she sounds or not.

127
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:40.600
I only know from your Instagram video of the Corona Lingus, I believe it was.

128
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.900
<v 0>Oh yeah. You nailed it. True story.</v>

129
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.040
<v 1>Well, when you're talking about, uh, like editing your joke in the audience,</v>

130
00:07:48.041 --> 00:07:51.370
not understanding it, when you say a joke one way and then you're like,

131
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.210
they're not understanding it. How, how are you then editing it down?

132
00:07:55.211 --> 00:07:58.030
What are the things you're manipulating to make them understand it in the

133
00:07:58.031 --> 00:07:58.864
future?

134
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:00.581
<v 0>Keep it simple.</v>

135
00:08:00.581 --> 00:08:05.320
I always think about McDonald's McDonald's do you know if this has got to be,

136
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:09.370
it's got to appeal to everybody and it's got to be easy to understand.

137
00:08:09.371 --> 00:08:11.440
It's like a website, you know, you ever go on a website,

138
00:08:11.441 --> 00:08:14.140
like when you read legal jargon, you're like, what the is this?

139
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.200
I think you got to just make it.

140
00:08:17.201 --> 00:08:20.650
So it's buttons and letters and colors, you know,

141
00:08:20.651 --> 00:08:25.600
just easy peasy to figure out you want to walk into that store and get it right.

142
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.940
<v 1>So it's like maybe they don't understand the premise.</v>

143
00:08:27.941 --> 00:08:30.340
So you need to be more clear on what it is.

144
00:08:30.341 --> 00:08:31.630
You're even trying to say with the premise.

145
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:36.850
<v 0>Yes, of course. I mean, look at Chris rock. He repeats his premise three times,</v>

146
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.510
you know, women can't go back in lifestyle.

147
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.500
They can't go back and lifestyle women. That's just him making sure you get in,

148
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.440
you know exactly what he's saying. Nice.

149
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.510
<v 1>Simple is better.</v>

150
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:54.070
<v 0>Oh, you got to keep it simple. In other words, that being confusing as a comic,</v>

151
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.340
right? Justin.

152
00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:57.930
<v 1>Borno Ville.</v>

153
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:01.830
What is your opinion of the live stream shows that are popping up online?

154
00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:05.490
Would you recommend starting one or waiting until this craziness is over?

155
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.760
<v 0>Hey, you gotta do what you gotta do. Juste, you know, uh, get out there,</v>

156
00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:14.360
keep saying, have an outlet. So about having an outlet, you know,

157
00:09:14.361 --> 00:09:17.020
we used to get up on stage twice a night, three times a night.

158
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:21.080
Now that just completely wiped out. So you got to figure something out.

159
00:09:21.081 --> 00:09:25.790
So if you want to do it, do it. I don't know if there's much to gain from it,

160
00:09:25.791 --> 00:09:30.560
but at least you and your gums and scheduling something,

161
00:09:30.561 --> 00:09:33.740
it gives you a little hope. Have you I'd say do, if you've done any of them,

162
00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:38.570
a one or two there, I think they're dumb. I'd rather do this. Yeah.

163
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:40.010
<v 1>That's what I've been asking.</v>

164
00:09:40.011 --> 00:09:44.390
Every comic that has come on here is like a lot of us right now. We're like,

165
00:09:44.391 --> 00:09:47.690
what do we even, what do we do as comedians? You know?

166
00:09:47.691 --> 00:09:51.380
And a lot of people are saying like Mike Cannon and, um,

167
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.510
Jacob Williams was on here today and they were all,

168
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:57.800
we're just creating a bunch of content while Sean Patton is on here saying he's

169
00:09:57.801 --> 00:10:01.100
doing more of these live stream pop-up shows and stuff like that.

170
00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:01.934
What are you doing?

171
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.800
<v 0>I'm doing this. I'm making videos. I'm tweeting like a madman.</v>

172
00:10:06.801 --> 00:10:09.560
I'm writing like a madman. Uh,

173
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.460
so for me it's all about staying funny and I don't feel like those,

174
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.470
those live shows are funny.

175
00:10:15.471 --> 00:10:18.080
That re really that funny because it's all about the laugh.

176
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:22.820
I need that response from an audience. So it's, it's tough.

177
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.810
Um, but you know, I'm not knocking them, do what you gotta do,

178
00:10:26.811 --> 00:10:29.300
but I like pods and I like the interaction.

179
00:10:29.301 --> 00:10:34.070
I don't feel like I'm getting a real reaction from those. Nice. All right.

180
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:35.413
Do what you gotta do.

181
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:36.381
<v 1>Yeah, exactly.</v>

182
00:10:36.381 --> 00:10:40.370
It's so early into this quarantine that it's still a lot of like trial and

183
00:10:40.371 --> 00:10:41.450
error. You know,

184
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:47.690
Sean Patton had said he did one early on. That was just like him and comics.

185
00:10:47.691 --> 00:10:48.890
And then he did a one,

186
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.330
like the day before our interview where it was like comics with an actual like

187
00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.650
audience of like 15 people on zoom. Like it was really so they're,

188
00:10:57.651 --> 00:10:59.960
they're growing, getting a little more sophisticated.

189
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.090
<v 0>But it's still.</v>

190
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.850
<v 1>Yeah, there, there may be a delay or something. It's still not okay.</v>

191
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:08.540
<v 0>As well. Does it audience then? That's different. I was stuck.</v>

192
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:13.460
I was thinking it was just you and a guy. So I mean,

193
00:11:13.461 --> 00:11:17.870
I'll do it. I'm sure. Eventually. Yeah. It's um.

194
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.960
<v 1>This is it's no Joe Rogan, but it'll definitely.</v>

195
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.870
<v 0>It'll you might've talked me into it.</v>

196
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:30.260
<v 1>This next one comes from Liam Harvey. It is uh, what's your favorite kind of.</v>

197
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.940
<v 0>I like a long flappy one. Just like,</v>

198
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:43.820
those are the best when it really gets the arrow. All right.

199
00:11:43.821 --> 00:11:45.080
And less importantly.

200
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.560
<v 1>Where's a good place to learn. Joke, writing techniques,</v>

201
00:11:48.561 --> 00:11:51.260
any books slash anything I can read.

202
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:56.950
<v 0>That's a good question. I don't, you could read the comedy Bible,</v>

203
00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.770
but it's not great. I think, uh,

204
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.450
go online as a YouTube video online of Seinfeld writing a joke in the New York

205
00:12:04.451 --> 00:12:08.560
times did it. That was pretty good. But again, it's,

206
00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:12.550
it's like boxing, you got to get in the ring, right? It's hard to learn.

207
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:15.700
You got to try it and fail and tweak it and try it.

208
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:19.630
Or you got to try it on regular people at your work or your family or friends.

209
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:24.220
If it's almost a two to tango kind of thing, you know, it's like saying, uh,

210
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:28.270
it's like saying, how can I learn to be sexy? No,

211
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:32.530
you got to go try it and be sexy and fail. And you know, you can't just

212
00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:36.070
jump right in. You need the response.

213
00:12:36.071 --> 00:12:39.460
So without knowing whether it's good or not, it's hard to get better.

214
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.080
That makes sense. Yeah.

215
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:42.030
<v 1>Yeah. There was a,</v>

216
00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.930
there's a Greg Dean book that was like step-by-step to stand up the scale of one

217
00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:46.764
I've ever read,

218
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.570
but it was good at breaking down one liners in terms of like how to,

219
00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:55.320
how to find your premise, how to set it up, how to misdirect it.

220
00:12:55.321 --> 00:12:59.490
So it was good in the early years of just finding maybe the mechanism behind

221
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.640
creating a joke, but you still have to say it on stage.

222
00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:08.730
<v 0>Yeah, yeah. Or to even a human being something, right? Yeah, exactly. Good luck.</v>

223
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.790
<v 1>Listen to hot breath podcasts. It's a great one, Liam.</v>

224
00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.020
<v 0>That'll be cool. Or just listen to Steven Wright to meet you Martin,</v>

225
00:13:16.021 --> 00:13:19.440
Mitch Hedberg, and just see what they did and go, why did that go that way?

226
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.270
Why do I, you know, gotta figure it out.

227
00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.820
<v 1>All right. Quinn Fitzgerald says, Oh, love the pod. All right. Thank you,</v>

228
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:28.890
Quinn. Oh, he's talking. Wait,

229
00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:30.750
which one are you talking to Tuesday or hot breath?

230
00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:33.720
I don't know which one he's talking about. Good question. Uh,

231
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:38.170
we'll say both where we're of the same ilk. Uh,

232
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:43.350
and he also asks, how do you know when you should move to New York for comedy?

233
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.750
<v 0>I don't know. It's like, I want a baby. There's no wrong or right time.</v>

234
00:13:48.751 --> 00:13:53.400
I think just go, just go. It gets 10 minutes together that you like.

235
00:13:53.401 --> 00:13:55.780
Although I went with 10 minutes, I was like, just kills everywhere.

236
00:13:55.781 --> 00:13:59.430
I'm going to show up to New York. Nobody's going to blow me bomb for two years.

237
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.720
So yeah. I would go sooner, better than later. Yeah.

238
00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:07.890
Just kind of jump in. Not right for this pandemic.

239
00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:13.170
<v 1>But otherwise just jump in. Yeah. And, um,</v>

240
00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.910
Sean Patton actually had fun insight into just like move here,

241
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:22.200
but just understand nothing's overnight and that you're going to be doing these

242
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:26.580
rough open mics and it's going to be uphill. But if you want to do comedy,

243
00:14:26.581 --> 00:14:29.040
then that's just part of the process.

244
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:34.620
<v 0>Yeah. You could be a great a pole vaulter, but New York is the Olympics.</v>

245
00:14:34.621 --> 00:14:37.080
So you're now you're coming to the Olympic camp and you're gonna have to step it

246
00:14:37.081 --> 00:14:37.914
up. Yep. Yep.

247
00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:41.820
<v 1>All right. Oh, Jason P. Leonard. He said, Hey comedy.</v>

248
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:46.350
<v 0>Ah, Lenny. He runs some great shows in Louisiana.</v>

249
00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:47.993
Great shows.

250
00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:51.980
<v 1>Thomas Mattel ski. What you,</v>

251
00:14:51.981 --> 00:14:54.800
when comedy kicks you in the teeth again and again?

252
00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:57.641
<v 0>Well,</v>

253
00:14:57.641 --> 00:15:01.390
the funny thing is the teeth kicking is what keeps you coming back because it

254
00:15:01.391 --> 00:15:05.230
hurts so bad that it motivates you to go. I got to do that again,

255
00:15:05.231 --> 00:15:09.490
just to feel better. And then that one could take in the balls too. But it just,

256
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.190
every now that you get that one good one that you're like, all right. All right.

257
00:15:12.191 --> 00:15:14.740
All right. I'm good. But you're only as good as your last set and it,

258
00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:18.460
it stings and it hurts. But what else can you do? I mean,

259
00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:21.340
if this is what you've chosen, this is it, you know,

260
00:15:21.341 --> 00:15:23.440
you got dumped before you didn't give up women.

261
00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:25.870
<v 1>What have you found to like,</v>

262
00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.590
in those low moments where like you did bomb or something didn't work out.

263
00:15:29.591 --> 00:15:33.100
What have, what did you find was helpful in you overcoming that faster?

264
00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:35.650
<v 0>Whew. Well,</v>

265
00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:40.180
you got to go back to the notebook and retool and

266
00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:44.860
go, go hard, go harder. And then, because it's so scary,

267
00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:49.030
that feeling is so painful that it makes you motivate you to work harder and go

268
00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:51.430
back. And then you're like, all right, now when I go back on stage,

269
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.593
I'll be ready.

270
00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.470
<v 1>Yeah. It's almost motivated the faster you get back on stage,</v>

271
00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:00.520
the better you'll feel type deal. Yes. Keep moving.

272
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.850
<v 0>Exactly. Totally. Yeah.</v>

273
00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:06.610
<v 1>All right. Mr. Leonard, he followed up with a question.</v>

274
00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:11.260
Do you think a lot of comics on any level won't come back once the virus's

275
00:16:11.261 --> 00:16:12.820
over? Ooh.

276
00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.960
<v 0>I sure hope so. We need a good,</v>

277
00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:21.970
we need a good [inaudible] company world. Uh, but yeah,

278
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.130
for sure. I mean, there's so many,

279
00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.240
even in January you see a huge influx because everybody's got their resolutions.

280
00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.100
And then by late February,

281
00:16:30.101 --> 00:16:32.020
they're gone because they realized there's no money in this.

282
00:16:32.021 --> 00:16:36.040
There's a lot of work. I I'm losing my nights. So, uh,

283
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:40.630
it's this is going to push out a lot of comics and I I'm, I'm happy about it,

284
00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:46.120
uh, because you know, it's not in the stage time for everybody.

285
00:16:46.121 --> 00:16:48.430
Let's be honest and look, everybody can do it.

286
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:52.180
Everybody should have the right to do comedy, but it's not for everybody.

287
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:57.010
And if you're just jerking off and having a fun hobby, that's great.

288
00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.910
But some of us are up by and food with this.

289
00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:06.070
So I don't know do what you want, but, uh, leave it to the, uh,

290
00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.380
the passionate. Yeah. How.

291
00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:10.660
<v 1>Are you making money right now, by the way also?</v>

292
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:16.480
<v 0>Well, this pays, I assume that, uh, no, I, uh,</v>

293
00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:20.860
I get my podcast is bringing in a lot of dough. I'm about to sell this special,

294
00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:24.130
uh, hopefully that I just dropped. So that'll,

295
00:17:24.131 --> 00:17:27.760
that'll be a nice chunk of change and the sound exchange. Oh yeah.

296
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.290
Sound exchange. Every time they put my album on serious, that's a nice channel.

297
00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:35.470
So I'm just living off of royalties basically.

298
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.040
<v 1>So when what's, what's the deal with the special,</v>

299
00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.350
when did you what's what's going on with that?

300
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:47.140
<v 0>Well, it took a little longer to edit because my editor had a snafu and</v>

301
00:17:47.141 --> 00:17:51.720
then we have a network and then they pulled out and now we got a new network.

302
00:17:51.721 --> 00:17:54.090
So there was all kinds of hiccups,

303
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.870
but we're back and it looks great and I'm proud of it and I'm happy with it.

304
00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.190
So it should come out soon,

305
00:17:59.191 --> 00:18:01.500
but I need a little time to promote now that it's all done.

306
00:18:01.501 --> 00:18:04.260
I thought it was going to come out yesterday, but everything fell apart.

307
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.700
So now it's coming out in like two or three weeks, but I just,

308
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:10.740
cause I need some promotion time. Oh, wow. Okay.

309
00:18:10.741 --> 00:18:15.210
Where'd you film it at filming the theater in LA called the dynasty

310
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.480
typewriter. We sold it out and we were like, well,

311
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:20.280
this is a pretty place we might as well shoot here.

312
00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:22.920
And it was all last minute and we just,

313
00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.950
it all came together and I thank Jesus, praise,

314
00:18:25.951 --> 00:18:28.320
Allah that I filmed it before this happened.

315
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:33.320
<v 1>Wow. And is this one of those specials you like paid for yourself with hope.</v>

316
00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:37.760
<v 0>To sell it? Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Totally. The Sam a real model.</v>

317
00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.650
<v 1>Yeah. As soon as to be the move. Yeah.</v>

318
00:18:39.651 --> 00:18:43.970
I want to get him on here to talk about how he did his whole thing and then

319
00:18:43.971 --> 00:18:46.640
released it actually through comedy Central's YouTube and all that.

320
00:18:46.641 --> 00:18:49.040
It's very interesting angle.

321
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.210
<v 0>Yeah. It seems to be the new world order. And uh, these other companies,</v>

322
00:18:53.211 --> 00:18:58.160
like he's one of the best comics. Netflix is stupid for not putting them on,

323
00:18:58.161 --> 00:19:01.430
but they just, they, they want shiny star fuckery,

324
00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:07.100
which I get it's a business. Hey, all right, Delta.

325
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.680
<v 1>Coming up next, Trent, Bab for writing.</v>

326
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:15.770
When you write multiple punchlines for one joke,

327
00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:20.120
do you tend to go with the one with the most surprise or the one that flows the

328
00:19:20.121 --> 00:19:20.954
best?

329
00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.830
<v 0>Ooh. Now you see that one.</v>

330
00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:29.450
That's a tough one because you should go with the one that it's a

331
00:19:29.451 --> 00:19:34.220
compromise of the best laugh and that you feel good about. It's got to fit you.

332
00:19:34.221 --> 00:19:37.730
You got to have integrity and go with it because sometimes you get a happy line

333
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:40.100
that kills, but you go, eh, Hey,

334
00:19:40.101 --> 00:19:42.620
that's probably been done a million times being in it's easy.

335
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.860
It's only getting a laugh because I say or TJ's or whatever.

336
00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:47.640
So you got to find the,

337
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:51.980
the nice integrity line between this kills.

338
00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.370
And I, I like it. I'm I approve of this.

339
00:19:55.730 --> 00:20:00.710
So then the one that with the flow, the flow is just going to happen.

340
00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:04.010
You can't just have a good punchline and change the flows and the punchline will

341
00:20:04.011 --> 00:20:07.100
change. So I wouldn't worry about the flow or whatever.

342
00:20:07.101 --> 00:20:09.740
I would worry about how you feel about it. And if it gets,

343
00:20:09.741 --> 00:20:11.180
it's got to get a huge laugh too.

344
00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.360
<v 1>Because it seems like if you feel better about the joke,</v>

345
00:20:14.361 --> 00:20:17.330
you'll be able to deliver it more consistently.

346
00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:21.500
<v 0>Totally, totally. And the more confidence you have behind it, like, you know,</v>

347
00:20:21.501 --> 00:20:23.960
when you're about to deliver a punchline, you go, this is going to kill.

348
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:26.390
That's what you want. It's almost like, you know,

349
00:20:26.391 --> 00:20:29.540
sometimes you shoot a basketball and right when it leaves your finger, you go,

350
00:20:29.541 --> 00:20:33.800
that's going to swish. Even before it hits mid air, you know, it's going in.

351
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.480
That's how a joke should feel. When you tell it.

352
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:40.100
<v 1>How long did you prepare for this new, special? How long were you a runner?</v>

353
00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.020
<v 0>I think I wrote the thing within two years,</v>

354
00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:49.840
but if I did another year of just polishing and then

355
00:20:49.841 --> 00:20:54.250
another year had six months of, of adding tags.

356
00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:59.320
Cause you got to almost fall out of love of a bit where you can see it clearly,

357
00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:03.160
you know, like we've all heard a woman be like my boyfriend's beautiful.

358
00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.730
And you look at him, he's a fat piece of garbage, but she, in her eyes,

359
00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:08.950
she loves him so much that he seems attractive.

360
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:12.970
Sometimes you have that with jokes, you know, you're like this joke.

361
00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:15.820
I love it so much. I'm so proud of it, but it's not that great of a joke.

362
00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:20.320
So you almost need to step back from your own material for awhile just to see

363
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.830
that the realness of it, you know,

364
00:21:23.831 --> 00:21:26.140
how accurate it is or how funny it actually is.

365
00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:28.680
<v 1>Are you, you're disciplined with writing,</v>

366
00:21:28.681 --> 00:21:32.730
but are you disciplined with like recording your set and reviewing your set as

367
00:21:32.731 --> 00:21:34.050
well? And like that process.

368
00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.770
<v 0>Pretty good at the beginning. You know, if the joke is new,</v>

369
00:21:37.771 --> 00:21:40.500
I'll listen to it a hundred times, but it, once it starts working,

370
00:21:40.501 --> 00:21:44.190
I just kind of put it over in the killing pile. Cool.

371
00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:47.190
And I don't really listen to it anymore, but you gotta listen to the new.

372
00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:52.380
<v 1>All right. Charlie Harper, first comic you saw live.</v>

373
00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:58.110
<v 0>Oh me. Ah, geez. I thought he was about to say his first time I got,</v>

374
00:21:58.111 --> 00:22:01.380
I saw alive. I saw this guy.

375
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:04.200
Are we talking real comics or like open miners.

376
00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.840
<v 1>Name, worthy comic.</v>

377
00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:12.960
<v 0>Um, geez, maybe Seinfeld. That's not simple. Oh,</v>

378
00:22:12.961 --> 00:22:17.790
one in Baton Rouge. Uh, dating a gal.

379
00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:22.290
She got me tickets for a birthday present. I still remember it. He ran out.

380
00:22:22.291 --> 00:22:25.020
He had the suit on. It was incredible. I still remember some of the bits.

381
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.640
I saw George Carlin shortly after that at a casino in Mississippi.

382
00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:32.910
Not a great set, but something cool to see.

383
00:22:32.911 --> 00:22:36.480
I'm glad I saw him was he died shortly after. Uh, so yeah,

384
00:22:36.481 --> 00:22:39.360
those are probably the two big ones that stand out. Nice.

385
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.910
<v 1>Zach Lyman. Where was your first headliner gig?</v>

386
00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:47.340
<v 0>Ooh,</v>

387
00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:52.560
first headline and gig was at a place called the Howlin Wolf in

388
00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:56.550
new Orleans. And it was like, it wasn't even a real headline again,

389
00:22:56.551 --> 00:22:58.350
it was like six comics and I went last, right?

390
00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:00.510
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. And those are big smarts.</v>

391
00:23:00.511 --> 00:23:02.100
Those are milestones though in our careers.

392
00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:05.130
<v 0>Sure, sure. I was, I was happy about it. I was excited. I was flattered.</v>

393
00:23:05.131 --> 00:23:07.740
My name was on the flyer. You know, 12 people showed up.

394
00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:11.250
It's a huge room that fits 500, but 12 people are there. Just,

395
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:16.710
you know, I bombed my off, but it was still, still a big moment.

396
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:22.490
My brother showed up and nobody, nobody liked it, but it was

397
00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:24.840
all right.

398
00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:28.080
<v 1>Liam. Harvey, how do you get away with riskier bits?</v>

399
00:23:28.081 --> 00:23:32.100
Like your pedophile bit grape juice. He said, yeah.

400
00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:35.850
<v 0>Oh, thanks. That's it took months and months.</v>

401
00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:40.740
It took almost a year to get that bit to work because it's so dark

402
00:23:40.741 --> 00:23:44.670
and you know, such a touchy subject,

403
00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:46.640
no intended with the kid touching,

404
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:51.080
but it's so tough that like you had to work that bit out,

405
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:55.940
but you've got to also factor in that they're terrified, you know?

406
00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:58.040
So it's tough to get those jokes to work.

407
00:23:58.041 --> 00:24:02.300
So you've got to almost have to tweak those to perfection in your apartment

408
00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.760
before you can actually get a laugh at it.

409
00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:08.930
The joke has to be pitch perfect before it will work because the subject matter

410
00:24:08.931 --> 00:24:09.980
is so edgy.

411
00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:14.290
<v 1>How do you get it right in your apartment alone without an audience.</v>

412
00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:17.080
<v 0>Because he's still bombed with it.</v>

413
00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.350
You got to just suck it up and bomb with it and just get little bits of

414
00:24:20.351 --> 00:24:24.430
information from the audience. Every time it bombs like, all right,

415
00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:27.730
it did a little bit. If I say it that way, if I say it faster, it does better.

416
00:24:27.731 --> 00:24:31.000
Or if I just lean into it, it got a little bit better. And then over time,

417
00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:34.510
just with those little clues, I could get it to work a hundred percent,

418
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:38.380
but it took a lot of trial and error of just

419
00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:43.000
Guinea pigging that bit over and over. Let me try it a little this way.

420
00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:45.640
Let me try that way. We tried it and it took forever, but I finally got it.

421
00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:50.320
<v 1>What makes you continue to pursue a joke like that?</v>

422
00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:53.530
Instead of just saying, uh it's, it's useless. I'll throw it away.

423
00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:57.730
<v 0>Everything in your body's like throw it away. You're bombing.</v>

424
00:24:57.731 --> 00:25:01.150
You're you're throwing your whole set off because this pedophile joke is

425
00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:02.170
freaking people out.

426
00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:06.400
But if you believe in it and you run it by comics,

427
00:25:06.401 --> 00:25:10.000
that's where comics come in handy because comics just see through,

428
00:25:10.001 --> 00:25:14.200
they don't see the they see, Oh, this is a good bit. I like the idea here.

429
00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:18.220
They're not just listening to the, you know, Oh, the buzz word.

430
00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.770
They actually hear the, the bit for what it is.

431
00:25:20.771 --> 00:25:23.020
So I think you gotta use your friends on that one.

432
00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:28.000
<v 1>Gotcha. All right. We're um, we've got about six minutes left kids.</v>

433
00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:31.870
So we're going to bump them in here. Uh, Mike fountain,

434
00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:37.240
best ways to recognize sharpen and develop your persona slash voice.

435
00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:42.490
<v 0>Ooh, man, I got to tell you that's a good question. When I was coming up,</v>

436
00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:46.540
I asked everybody that question. I I'm over Pete Holmes and I asked him,

437
00:25:46.541 --> 00:25:50.140
I asked Tom Papa. I asked everybody when I was starting out. Cause I was like,

438
00:25:50.141 --> 00:25:52.360
what the hell is your voice? What is that? Why is,

439
00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:57.310
why is it really found there as a not I haven't found mine and somebody told me

440
00:25:57.311 --> 00:25:58.810
I forgot who, but somebody gave me the grid.

441
00:25:58.811 --> 00:26:03.610
Advice is look at all your jokes that work and find the common link

442
00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:07.060
between all those jokes. And that's probably your voice.

443
00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:10.450
Why do you keep going back to these? Why is this subject matter?

444
00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:13.780
Touched on a lot. Why is this like this? Why did you pick that material?

445
00:26:13.781 --> 00:26:18.400
Whatever it is. And that helped me and listening to yourself and you go, Oh,

446
00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:21.520
that's a, that's a joke I would tell. Or you listen to your friends. I go,

447
00:26:21.521 --> 00:26:25.210
that's such a Mark joke. That's and you're like, really? And then you go, okay,

448
00:26:25.211 --> 00:26:27.850
so what the hell is Mark? What the hell is that? You know? And just,

449
00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:32.710
it's all about clues and remembering everything, take it all in. So for me,

450
00:26:32.711 --> 00:26:36.190
I figured out eventually that my shtick is,

451
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.500
it's basically saying if this is like that, then why isn't this like that?

452
00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:46.560
And that's why whole act. Yeah. I don't see color. Well that I'm black. No,

453
00:26:46.561 --> 00:26:50.490
you're not. Uh, you know, just by inconsistencies.

454
00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:54.680
<v 1>All right, Vic Sedenio he said comedy.</v>

455
00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:57.380
<v 0>Epic Vicks,</v>

456
00:26:57.381 --> 00:27:02.270
vapor rub Michael Vick victorious. Sorry.

457
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:05.420
<v 1>No, you're good. I, I would, I would play the game with you,</v>

458
00:27:05.421 --> 00:27:08.750
but I want to make sure we get all these questions, but yeah, in a,

459
00:27:08.751 --> 00:27:11.420
in a longer interview, I'll tag them up with you. Uh,

460
00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:14.900
how long after you write a joke, do you try it on stage?

461
00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:19.670
And so you review notes before going on stage or edit

462
00:27:19.671 --> 00:27:20.504
after?

463
00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:23.600
<v 0>Well, is this two questions?</v>

464
00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:27.350
<v 1>I think it's um, how long after you read a joke, will you try it on stage?</v>

465
00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:31.880
And then do you review your notes before going on? Or do you just edit after?

466
00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:37.040
<v 0>Sure. A good question there, Vicky. I write,</v>

467
00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:40.280
if I feel good about a joke that I've written, I'll do it that night.

468
00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:44.540
Sometimes I'll write it on the train on the way to a show and feel like, Oh,

469
00:27:44.541 --> 00:27:49.370
this is, this is, this is a jackpot guaranteed laugh. I'll try it.

470
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:52.460
And it doesn't always work, but nine out of 10 times, it doesn't.

471
00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:54.800
But if I feel good about it, I'll try it.

472
00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:57.410
Sometimes I have an idea in the shower and I go,

473
00:27:57.411 --> 00:27:59.660
this is big and you got to like take it apart.

474
00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:02.540
And sometimes that takes weeks before you bring it on the stage,

475
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:07.010
because it's such a complex idea that you've got to simplify before you bring it

476
00:28:07.011 --> 00:28:09.620
out to the masses. And two,

477
00:28:09.621 --> 00:28:13.700
I will look at my notes until the millisecond. Before I grabbed the microphone.

478
00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:17.090
I'm walking on the stage, looking at my notes. You got to look at your notes.

479
00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:22.040
I read something when I was a kid that if you study right before the

480
00:28:22.041 --> 00:28:23.420
test, you have like,

481
00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.870
if you like you read through your study material before your test,

482
00:28:26.871 --> 00:28:31.400
you'll you'll do like 28% better. And it's the same with your jokes.

483
00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:36.020
If you look through it, especially new stuff, it helps. Boom.

484
00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:37.753
All right.

485
00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:39.643
<v 1>Sean Murphy, I've heard,</v>

486
00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:43.160
I've heard for years that you need to be able to perform clean comedy.

487
00:28:43.161 --> 00:28:46.100
I try hard to write clean, meaning I don't curse a lot,

488
00:28:46.101 --> 00:28:50.600
but my subject matter always ends up adult. What's your opinion on clean comp?

489
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:54.920
<v 0>I hate to say it Shawnee Murph Doug,</v>

490
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:59.150
but it is very helpful. Very, almost,

491
00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:03.440
almost necessary. I mean, even David tells like the funniest guy on the planet,

492
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:08.060
who's got a midget jokes and GEs, his he's got clean. He can write clean,

493
00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:13.220
he can do it. So I think it's imperative. If you want to do balance,

494
00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:16.220
you want to do all these late nights. You got to have it.

495
00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:19.580
So it's a good way to get in the door. I'm not saying it to you.

496
00:29:19.581 --> 00:29:23.840
I'm not saying it's your voice or your path or that for forever.

497
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:26.570
But I think it's good to have and it,

498
00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:29.420
suck it up and try to make it work.

499
00:29:29.421 --> 00:29:33.500
Like let's say you're an amazing wrestler and you want to do the MMA.

500
00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:37.430
You got to learn boxing. You got to box a little, so have it in your corner.

501
00:29:37.431 --> 00:29:42.100
You know, I'm not saying it's gotta be your future career. Uh, what,

502
00:29:42.101 --> 00:29:45.490
what's the opposite of temporary permanent. Thank you.

503
00:29:45.491 --> 00:29:49.270
It's not your permanent world, but try it, knock it out.

504
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.090
And it's harder. It is harder. I will say,

505
00:29:52.091 --> 00:29:55.360
as a comment I can admit clean is harder. Dirty is easier.

506
00:29:55.361 --> 00:29:57.940
I'm not saying dirty is bad. I'm not saying dirty is hack,

507
00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:01.510
but it's easier because sex will get a laugh. Cursing will get a laugh.

508
00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.900
So challenge yourself by trying to write some clean.

509
00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:08.850
<v 1>Yeah. And if you didn't have clean, you wouldn't be able to open for a Seinfeld.</v>

510
00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.520
<v 0>Yeah, exactly, exactly. And I trust me,</v>

511
00:30:11.521 --> 00:30:16.380
I had to sift through albums of stuff to find the cleanest.

512
00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:20.190
That's like his level of clean. And um, I'll tell you what, I'm glad I had it.

513
00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:25.680
<v 1>All right. Dos, Mohs, Misa Amigos, uh, Charlie Harper.</v>

514
00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:30.120
What do you feel is the biggest drawback that keeps the bigger distributors from

515
00:30:30.121 --> 00:30:31.470
buying specials?

516
00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:39.720
<v 0>Well, I'll tell you what Netflix told me. They said we got a lot of honkies,</v>

517
00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:40.920
a lot of straight Whitey,

518
00:30:40.921 --> 00:30:45.060
but if you're selling out like 2000 seats or more,

519
00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:49.770
we'll have you, because that means they can guarantee views.

520
00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:55.110
So be a minority, get in a wheelchair,

521
00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.190
that to have something, uh,

522
00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:02.460
or get famous and then go and become a stand up.

523
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:07.200
Um, or just get a following. If you get a following on your own,

524
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:11.010
it become some YouTube. that'll help, you know,

525
00:31:11.011 --> 00:31:15.210
go get a huge YouTube numbers and then send them your special. They'll buy it.

526
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:18.780
They're they're just, they're just business people. They're their suits.

527
00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:22.890
They just want numbers. They want money. They want views. So, uh,

528
00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:24.450
if you don't want to do it the long way,

529
00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:28.920
that's your route go viral, then do comedy.

530
00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:34.140
<v 1>All right. Um, Trent Bab, uh,</v>

531
00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:36.870
Seinfeld told you to move around more on stage. Do you,

532
00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:40.020
do you bring that advice to all your gigs or just the larger ones?

533
00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:44.820
<v 0>Now I do it at all of them. Why the hell? Not because I wouldn't do it,</v>

534
00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:47.700
but when he told me that I was like, eh, what the hell?

535
00:31:47.701 --> 00:31:51.480
This guy's old fashioned. He's, you know, he's out of touch. And I did it.

536
00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:55.200
And my set went from a B minus to an a plus.

537
00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:56.970
So he was right.

538
00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:01.350
And I I'm glad I took his advice and I'm glad I applied it because why the hell

539
00:32:01.351 --> 00:32:05.070
not? If it works on a theater, it'll work on a club.

540
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:08.970
So I'm not jumping around. Like, what did you tell them? The theater,

541
00:32:08.971 --> 00:32:13.170
everything. I used to walk out, plant my feet at a,

542
00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:17.190
on a theater stage and just deliver my jokes standing there. And they went well,

543
00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.580
but you walk out and you walk all the way to one side walk all the way.

544
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:25.140
They'll do it like a Chris rock thing, start saying the N word, everything. And,

545
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:27.240
uh, you will that crowd.

546
00:32:27.241 --> 00:32:30.870
Can't take their eyes off of you and they're mesmerized. And now,

547
00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:34.020
now there are so many parents that they're engaged more and listening more.

548
00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:37.380
So they're going to hear every joke, every word, every punch.

549
00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:40.430
So that equals more or less. Boom.

550
00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.580
<v 1>All right. And the final question here, I'm going to squeeze in skip,</v>

551
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:48.350
because I met him in, uh, Lafayette, Louisiana. I did, um,

552
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:51.950
one of Jason's shows last year and he bought a hot breaths shirt.

553
00:32:51.951 --> 00:32:54.710
So I want to let him close with the final question.

554
00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:58.240
<v 0>See you, bye merge. You have to get paid in the ads.</v>

555
00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:01.210
<v 1>So a skip asks,</v>

556
00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:05.260
how long will you keep a bit slash work on it until you drop it?

557
00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:08.980
Especially if you love the bit, but it's not getting the response you want.

558
00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:10.683
Okay?

559
00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:14.770
<v 0>Aye. You got to drop them. Greg Geraldo said, you got to kill your babies.</v>

560
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:15.551
It's hard,

561
00:33:15.551 --> 00:33:20.230
but I've seen comics in New York doing the same bit and it bombs every

562
00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:23.770
time and they keep doing it and it makes you look worse.

563
00:33:23.771 --> 00:33:25.750
And it also makes you look crazy. Like you're going,

564
00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:28.690
what are you trying to get out of this bed? It never was worked once.

565
00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.760
Get rid of it, but I know it's hard.

566
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.550
We're so attached and we took the time to write it.

567
00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:36.880
So it's so hard to let it go. But if you truly believe in it,

568
00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:40.000
I would put it aside. As I said, fall out of love with it,

569
00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:43.720
or become a better writer over time and then revisit it.

570
00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:47.320
And you can really look at it from a clear eye and go,

571
00:33:47.321 --> 00:33:49.120
that's what I was missing. That's it.

572
00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:52.330
I miss that one little angle and that changed the whole bit.

573
00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:57.250
So you really believe in it, put it in the drawer, come back in a year.

574
00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:02.410
<v 1>Boom, Mark Norman to everyone. Let's give him a round of applause.</v>

575
00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:08.500
Thank you, Mark. For coming back on hot breath, man. I know we, uh, we had, uh,

576
00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:12.760

577
00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.290
so, uh.

578
00:34:14.410 --> 00:34:18.040
<v 0>I know I'll, I'll be back. It's already rescheduled. I'll be back. Uh,</v>

579
00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:21.370
