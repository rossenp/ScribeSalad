you got a tenant and you just said that he doesn't watch porn.

15
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.990
You seem a little pent up. I never watched porn. Wow.

16
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.700
And I haven't watched porn in men,

17
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.150
but I do it every day and it's gotta be black. Yeah.

18
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.840
But I don't know. How do you, how do you do it? You, what do you imagination?

19
00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:18.680
Like eighth grade style? Uh, I I'm older. I just, I don't know. Yeah.

20
00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:20.960
I don't think back to, I don't even turn off,

21
00:01:20.961 --> 00:01:24.740
back off in black and white anymore. Really? I swear to God.

22
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.410
I'm just like, dude, get the out. You're sitting. You're weird.

23
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.100

<v 0>Uh, alpha. He wins. He wins. Yeah.</v>

25
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.060
We're in New York and it feels more like, Oh,

26
00:01:41.061 --> 00:01:43.940
that was a clever take on that joke. And it was,

27
00:01:43.941 --> 00:01:48.320
it feels more already a little bit like a little more intellectually, like,

28
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.960
like David tells, I mentioned he looks like a hobo. Right.

29
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.640
But he's just brilliant guy. You know.

30
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.110
<v 2>He's alive. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.950
Do you always have somebody like that in the building that makes you check that

32
00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:00.170
checks the, all the levels? Yes. It's like,

33
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.750
even if he's not personally doing it, it's just him being there.

34
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.880
There's a ceiling as to what's going on.

35
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.330
<v 0>Yeah. But then you go to the comedy store, I'm in the main room green room.</v>

36
00:02:08.331 --> 00:02:11.390
And you're like, look, all these sexy dudes, you know, like Brennan shoves,

37
00:02:11.391 --> 00:02:15.680
a chiseled fat. Like he's got the slick hair,

38
00:02:15.681 --> 00:02:17.300
the cool shoes got a chain on. I'm like,

39
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.860
I would never even think to put on a chain.

40
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.880
<v 2>The white part of bacon. Yeah. It's called the white part of bacon. Still good.</v>

41
00:02:22.881 --> 00:02:25.790
But boy, little thick and not good.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.800
<v 0>Yeah. He's a thick crust. And he's got the cheese in there too. You know,</v>

43
00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:32.600
you stretch it and it pulls.

44
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.060
<v 2>But I was like, dang. I was.</v>

45
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.540
<v 0>Jesus. I know. I know. But he's like seven foot one.</v>

00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:42.080
He's got a huge piece of bad. It's crazy. One leg dude is.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.060
<v 0>It's pretty crazy. It's a kickstand, a Dick Stan. Uh, all, all the Europe ones,</v>

51
00:02:56.061 --> 00:02:59.000
you know, getting loose in Amsterdam, we got loose. We, you know,

52
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.830

53
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:07.540
not a weed guy. I can't do it. I'm too up. That weed brings out all the demons.

54
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.440
It doesn't suppress them like alcohol what'd you mean like booze and uppers?

55
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.060
Yeah. Yeah. You don't seem like a lost, you have your darkness.

56
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.900
It's from your childhood. I think. So you had a weird childhood. How so? Well,

57
00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:23.710
let's see. My dad got a wild hair up his and bought a mansion,

58
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.710
dilapidated mansion in a poor black neighborhood. So first of all,

59
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:29.260
the house was. We barely had running water. It was, you know,

60
00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:32.350
we'd have family meetings like, all right, go at school. Don't here.

61
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:35.560
We need the water. And then my dad started running out of money.

62
00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:39.550
So he made the back half a bed and breakfast, like old style.

63
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.970
But so my mom's whipping up pancakes at 8:00 AM and I'm like, can I get one?

64
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.680
She's like blow big Dick, eat a bowl of Cheerios. Gunt. And so I was like,

65
00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:49.840
all right, sorry. Jesus. And so,

66
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.470
you know there's so my parents were workaholics. They're checked out. You know,

67
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.050
they, they, they were nice people, but they're just like, Hey,

68
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:59.680
we gave birth to you. You figure it out. Yeah. Go watch TV.

69
00:03:59.681 --> 00:04:02.260
There's no attention. Yes. Dr. Drew,

70
00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:06.160
I just common baby boy said give him attention.

71
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.150
So what Dr. Doosan. So he said you're uh, cause I was like, my mom didn't react.

72
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.150
Like I have girlfriends. I'll introduce her to my mom. They're like, whew.

73
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.820
That was tough. I felt like I was bombing in there. I'm like welcome to my life.

74
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.830
You. Jesus Christ. I'm 20 years of that growing up and uh,

75
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.860
last from straight. Like asked me a question. Just ask me a random question.

76
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.200
<v 3>Um, my mom, um, a random question. Um, where are you from?</v>

77
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.200
<v 0>What time is it? Where are we going to get at? It's just like, Oh. Sorry. Yeah.</v>

78
00:04:40.201 --> 00:04:43.050
And it's, she's not mean, she's just like, she's just got her checked out.

79
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.960
She just like thinking about, I gotta pay the bill, I got to water the plants,

80
00:04:45.961 --> 00:04:48.240
you know? And you're like, you have brothers and sisters, older brother.

81
00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:52.080
And he's a genius. He's like this, you know, math and computer wizard.

82
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.590
And our neighborhood was so dangerous that he just head into a computer,

83
00:04:55.591 --> 00:04:58.410
like as a kid. And he just became like DAS and.

84
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.930
You make friends in the neighborhood with the black. Yeah. Yeah.

85
00:05:00.931 --> 00:05:03.180
But then you got into fights and there was a lot of racial tension.

86
00:05:03.181 --> 00:05:06.810
It was the nineties and bikes were stolen and we got robbed all the time.

87
00:05:06.811 --> 00:05:10.620
We had this crazy alarm going off because our house was so big and you would

88
00:05:10.621 --> 00:05:10.771
just,

89
00:05:10.771 --> 00:05:14.010
I'd be like an eight year old kid and you'd just hear like glass breaking and

90
00:05:14.011 --> 00:05:14.340
then.

91
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.740
<v 4>Woo. I'm just like, ah.</v>

92
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.290
<v 0>I'm in my room. Like hugging up Teddy, you know,</v>

93
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.030
hoping I don't get raped by Leroy. And uh, you know, you go downstairs and Hey,

94
00:05:24.031 --> 00:05:27.210
the TV is gone today. You know? And that was, that was a Tuesday.

95
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.800
And we got robbed all the time. My dad he's got like, he's like, N-word rich.

96
00:05:31.801 --> 00:05:34.710
You know where he's like, Oh, we're going to buy a Lexus, but it's Alexis,

97
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.410
you know? So the Lexus would get stolen and he's like, all right, he'll,

98
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.740
he'll give me like cab money to go to school and. And uh,

99
00:05:40.741 --> 00:05:43.620
and that was just how it was. I remember I told the store on Rogan,

100
00:05:43.621 --> 00:05:46.800
but I got my bike stolen. Just, just street Tufts, you know,

101
00:05:46.801 --> 00:05:50.010
they would rub their front tire on your back tire. And that meant like a, your.

102
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.320
And they would just take your bike.

103
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.890
<v 4>Forever. I didn't get a good night's sleep, but that did end up working.</v>

104
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.130
Oh really? It worked for both of them. It didn't.

105
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.310
<v 0>Work for me. I tried these dehydration pills, like to dry you out.</v>

106
00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:02.600
That didn't work. And then my dad,

107
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:05.890
eventually we got so fed up because he was annoyed with the bedwetting.

108
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.460
He's like, you got to grow up, be a loser. So he said no more liquids after six.

109
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.410
So I'm sitting there eating Doritos at six Oh eight going like, you know,

110
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:18.440
I look like a, like a Somali pirate. I'm so thirsty. I'm like,

111
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.620
it's like Waterworld. I got to pee in a jar and filter it. You know,

112
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:25.970
I'm so thirsty. And I'm, you know, my brother's gov judge guzzling,

113
00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:28.310
a Kool-Aid and and Pepsi. And I'm like.

114
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.380
<v 1>He's not having that problem at all. It was brutal.</v>

115
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.440
<v 0>Oh man, that was a dry County. And so you would,</v>

116
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.780
would you not go to sleep overs because of it?

117
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.630
I would go cause I wanted to hang and I wanted to, you know,

118
00:06:40.631 --> 00:06:44.470
be a part of society. I'd want to be like a weirdo, like disabled guy.

119
00:06:44.471 --> 00:06:47.950
Like I can't go, I have a problem. So I would just stay up all night.

120
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.880
And it was like, I was like in a Holocaust death camp, I was like, all right,

121
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.510
I'll sleep in shifts. You know,

122
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.100
split for like 10 minutes here and I'll wake up and I saw everything.

123
00:06:57.101 --> 00:07:00.280
I would just walk around my friend's houses at like two in the morning.

124
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.060
They're they're snoozing and I'd go through the mom's panties and you know,

125
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.730
watch some TV and check the fridge.

126
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.500
I was like a weird night owl Nightcrawler guy at like nine, you know,

127
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.020
checking out porn, you know,

128
00:07:14.021 --> 00:07:16.000
I'm going in and out of the house playing with a cat,

129
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.920
whatever I had to do jerk off on a friend's face. Anything just kill the time.

130
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.230
Did you guys jerk off together? You and your buds? No, never. Oh,

131
00:07:26.231 --> 00:07:30.760
that was a big one and none of the w okay, so let's talk about that too,

132
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.970
because was it a circle jerk thing or what was it.

133
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:35.543
<v 1>Were like, nah.</v>

134
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.640
<v 0>You take a corner, I'll take a corner. We got the porn in the middle and uh,</v>

135
00:07:42.641 --> 00:07:44.290
yeah, it was like a bonding experience.

136
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.010
I did make my friend taste it once and he never talked to me again.

137
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:52.660
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

138
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.390
<v 0>Like, I dare you to taste. He's like, I'm not tasting. I was like a double dog.</v>

139
00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:59.170
And he was like, Hey Jay, you know, it was a great moment.

140
00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.780
<v 1>I mean, we're still cool. He's he's dead.</v>

141
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.250
<v 0>Now. He was a gay porn star.</v>

142
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:09.790
<v 2>When I was growing up, they had a thing for gyp. And for a while,</v>

143
00:08:09.791 --> 00:08:12.100
girls would put a LSD in their vagina.

144
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:15.250
<v 1>Home.</v>

145
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:19.390
<v 0>A Dick trip. Your Dick will go in and get all burning, man. That was the thing.</v>

146
00:08:19.391 --> 00:08:20.320
Yeah. Whoa.

147
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.260
<v 2>The girl was tripping. Then you get in there and get some of the trip.</v>

148
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.903
Is this real?

149
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.030
<v 0>I don't mind a trip, but I don't want to through my Dick hole.</v>

150
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.350
That's that's a weird spot.

151
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:33.790
<v 2>That's a way. That's a wow. That's a wild entrance. That's a front. So positive.</v>

152
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:39.580
Holy hell. Uh, Nick. Nick's a creeper. Well,

153
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.010
he's a premature baby dude making up for lost time.

154
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:44.350
<v 0>You came out good.</v>

155
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:45.520
<v 2>That's what I'm saying, man.</v>

156
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.550
Why a lot of these guys go on 36 and Nick got out early, bro.

157
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.540
<v 0>Oh yeah. I was like a seasick really? Oh yeah.</v>

158
00:08:52.541 --> 00:08:56.130
I came out through the roof. Oh, wow. I guess maybe.

159
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:57.420
<v 2>The mood rooms or something.</v>

160
00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.160
<v 0>That I didn't come up through the door.</v>

161
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.580
<v 2>I could see you being like, I don't know. You know,</v>

162
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.900
is this the best thoroughfare? Right. See what else?

163
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.250
<v 0>And you've all touched your mom's badge. I haven't touched, well,</v>

164
00:09:07.251 --> 00:09:10.190
maybe you've touched my mom's. She's a big, but uh,

165
00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.920
I haven't touched my mom's vagina, which feels pretty good. Oh yeah.

166
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.490
<v 2>Oh that I guess I could see that there is always a weird element.</v>

167
00:09:16.491 --> 00:09:19.090
I think sometimes when I look at my mom and she, and I both know it.

168
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:20.930
<v 0>I did. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

169
00:09:20.931 --> 00:09:24.980
You ruined her Libya for awhile and they say it goes back.

170
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:28.790
<v 2>Yeah, I hear it's never exactly the same, but that's my buddy said that, Oh.</v>

171
00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:33.440
<v 0>Well maybe had a big kid or something. Yeah. He said though,</v>

172
00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.470
because we've all banged some milks and it didn't feel that different.

173
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.500
<v 2>Yeah. I don't have any feelings in my penis.</v>

174
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.600
<v 0>At all. I don't feel well. Come on.</v>

175
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.190
<v 2>I don't think so. I mean, it all, so many of the nerves were in my brain,</v>

176
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.260
so it's like, if I think hard enough, I can feel something,

177
00:09:48.261 --> 00:09:52.490
but otherwise it's kind of like, uh, wait, are you serious? Yeah. I'm just not,

178
00:09:52.491 --> 00:09:54.770
I mean, yeah. Like not very sensitive downtown.

179
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:59.930
<v 0>I think so. I don't know. You're not just all over really. Oh,</v>

180
00:09:59.931 --> 00:10:03.170
I put it in. I'm done. Oh yeah. I mean, and don't worry.

181
00:10:03.171 --> 00:10:06.320
I got the brain stuff too. I'm going and I hate myself. I'm tiny.

182
00:10:06.321 --> 00:10:10.910
I'm gay all this, but I don't have the, uh, the band back together.

183
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.140
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. My like a, like a girl at seeing the notebook.

184
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:17.960
It's just weeping. It's bad.

185
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.860
<v 2>Bro. The first time I ever had sex, I remember getting right up.</v>

186
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:26.510
Like literally my penis was right outside of this girl's um,

187
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:31.580
vagina. And it just like sneezed, you know?

188
00:10:31.581 --> 00:10:34.820
Just like, like it was so nervous or something. Yeah.

189
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.630
<v 0>So it hit the out. So it, it, it pressure washed. Oh definitely.</v>

190
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.870
<v 2>And it was like a, it was almost like, he was like, Oh,</v>

191
00:10:40.871 --> 00:10:45.320
I'm too sick to handle this, this vomited outside of this girl's entryway,

192
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.080
you know, puked at the table. He didn't even get to the buffet. Oh,

193
00:10:48.081 --> 00:10:49.820
I didn't hear. Oh.

194
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.500
<v 0>Man. You golden corralled. And.</v>

195
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:55.040
<v 2>We were so ready. Everybody was so ready. So then at 10,</v>

196
00:10:55.041 --> 00:10:59.570
like I was so ready bro. And that was crazy. Cause I had to like, Oh, hold on.

197
00:10:59.571 --> 00:11:01.760
I don't want to just do this. I don't want to make up this long.

198
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:06.920
<v 0>Right. Um, all right, please, please tear. I,</v>

199
00:11:06.921 --> 00:11:09.200
I do want to talk to you about dating though.

200
00:11:09.201 --> 00:11:13.940
So please all these problems going on the bed wedding, the, this, the, that,

201
00:11:13.941 --> 00:11:17.540
what age do you start getting into girls and actually dating.

202
00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:19.880
And how old are you when you lose your virginity?

203
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:24.290
I was such a mess like anxiety wise insecurity wise that I couldn't

204
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:26.040
pick up a lady.

205
00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.690
I had to be boozing and she had to be booze and I w I had no game or anything,

206
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.390
but I eventually met a gal and uh,

207
00:11:32.391 --> 00:11:36.800
we became like serious and it was like my only girlfriend and we dated from high

208
00:11:36.801 --> 00:11:41.240
school til out of college. Wow. High school sweetheart. We did it for 12 years,

209
00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:45.920
but uh, I peed on her many a time. Do you still, are you still talking to her?

210
00:11:45.921 --> 00:11:50.870
She's married now, but we're cool. I kind of her over a few times, but uh,

211
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.300
yeah, we're cool. And she was great. She did.

212
00:11:55.301 --> 00:11:57.730
You both take each other's virginity? No,

213
00:11:57.731 --> 00:12:01.890
no serious lady that is virgins. And then, Oh,

214
00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:05.970
I a prostitute and she bent some other guy, I think, out of anger.

215
00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:07.830
And then we got back together.

216
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.850
So you lost her virginity to a processor or she didn't charge me.

217
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:17.220
Yeah. It worked out. I had a coupon,

218
00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:19.860
so I got, what did you,

219
00:12:19.861 --> 00:12:23.460
why did you decide to do it like that when you had a girlfriend? Well, it was,

220
00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.070
we were kinda on the rocks. So we were talking,

221
00:12:26.071 --> 00:12:30.150
remember when people were talking, but I don't know. We weren't really official.

222
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.441
It started yet.

223
00:12:31.441 --> 00:12:35.580
It wasn't like you had been going for a year and hadn't had sex or we're on the

224
00:12:35.581 --> 00:12:40.260
phone every now and then. And we'd go to prom or something to sock hop together,

225
00:12:40.261 --> 00:12:42.480
but it wasn't too serious.

226
00:12:42.481 --> 00:12:46.650
And then it was why two K was in the air. Do you remember that? Yeah,

227
00:12:46.651 --> 00:12:50.220
when the world was going to end and it was a, it was a bug and it was two,

228
00:12:50.221 --> 00:12:53.310
it was 1999. And me and my friends went to the French quarter.

229
00:12:53.311 --> 00:12:57.690
It was new year's Eve, Eve. And, uh, the best, the best years, Eve,

230
00:12:57.691 --> 00:13:02.040
Eve is way better than new year's. Yes it is. There's no pressure. No,

231
00:13:02.041 --> 00:13:05.190
one's trying to look good. Hurry up and get somewhere. Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

232
00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:08.760
The new year's Eve, Eve is the jam, the jam. And you know,

233
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.790
we had this big party to go to on new year's Eve. So new year's Eve, we're like,

234
00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:15.860
Hey, let's do the quarter. We're right here. Let's do it. So, uh, I,

235
00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:17.190
I w I'm out with friends,

236
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.870
I see a woman on the balcony and she's just flashing at the Ramada hotel on

237
00:13:21.871 --> 00:13:24.600
bourbon. I'll never forget it. And she was an older, uh, you know,

238
00:13:24.601 --> 00:13:29.430
she she'd seen some winters say that she was a little,

239
00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:33.180
you know, a tear. You could tell she,

240
00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:37.590
she looked like Jennifer Aniston after a good fistfight. And,

241
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.400
but she had a leather jacket with no shirt and she just kept flashing people,

242
00:13:41.401 --> 00:13:45.330
which is pretty commonplace in the beginning. Yeah. I was going to say that's.

243
00:13:45.331 --> 00:13:46.164
Yeah.

244
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:50.970
So there's a buzz in the air and I'm 16 and we're all drinking and.

245
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.960
And uh, so we're just staring at her. This is pre Brazzers.

246
00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:59.700
So we're just like pretend. And,

247
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:03.600
uh, this was pre, um, girls gone wild too. Isn't it?

248
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:08.910
Maybe like right there. They're right in there. So were big. Yeah. And, uh,

249
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.480
w she she's a staring and she she's like yelling at us,

250
00:14:12.481 --> 00:14:15.030
like what what's going on with you guys? You know, we're like, Hey,

251
00:14:15.031 --> 00:14:19.470
we'd like to come up, we're around. And she's like, I'll come down.

252
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.050
So she comes down and, uh,

253
00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:26.580
she's talking to us and it right then it's like, Oh, this is game on. Like,

254
00:14:26.581 --> 00:14:29.760
this woman is down for something. And, but we're so nervous.

255
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.660
Cause you're still talking to an adult lady who's, you know, 78. And she's like,

256
00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.630
uh, you kids want to come up and throw some beads. And I immediately,

257
00:14:36.631 --> 00:14:39.720
I was like, Oh, she thinks we're kids. This isn't gonna work.

258
00:14:39.721 --> 00:14:42.210
So I just do a hail Mary and I go, Hey, you want to,

259
00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:45.390
I don't want to go on a 2000 a Virgin. And she goes, well, I won't let ya.

260
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:50.040
And that was it. How old was she? She's probably 50 something really? 53.

261
00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:54.620
And so then what happens? So I, she brings me and two guys up,

262
00:14:54.621 --> 00:14:58.220
my other two friends went and got drinks or something. And, uh,

263
00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.910
I remember she opens the door to her hotel room, the door swings open.

264
00:15:01.911 --> 00:15:05.870
There's an old man with a white beard and a Harley Davidson hat and a leather

265
00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:09.170
jacket, just sitting, staring at the door. And I was like, Oh,

266
00:15:09.171 --> 00:15:14.030
we're we're going to die. Yeah. This guy's lovely. He has a gun. That's exactly.

267
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:18.890
He had, I guarantee you, he had a gun. I'm sure he had boots on. He had a knife.

268
00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.580
I was going to say he was probably packed all. Yeah, no doubt about it.

269
00:15:22.581 --> 00:15:26.210
This guy came out of like some crazy like Nashville or something.

270
00:15:26.211 --> 00:15:30.410
This guy was like a biker guy. So he goes, which one is it?

271
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.480
And she pointed to me and he goes, all right, you too,

272
00:15:32.481 --> 00:15:35.450
let's go have some beers on the balcony. And you know, now we're kind of like,

273
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:39.110
when your buddies now got to go outside and drink with this dude. Yeah.

274
00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:42.740
But you know, they're cool with it. Cause they just want the booze, you know?

275
00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:45.050
So they're like, ah, it. Let's see what happens. That's how it was.

276
00:15:45.051 --> 00:15:50.000
But we were feral. We would just did. Whim, no, no plans. And uh,

277
00:15:50.001 --> 00:15:53.330
yeah. So I've told this story many times, but she just sat on the bed. She goes,

278
00:15:53.331 --> 00:15:56.450
how do you want to do this? And I go, well, I'm trying to act cool. I'm like,

279
00:15:56.451 --> 00:16:00.860
I'll take a blow job first. And she goes, I don't give blow jobs. And I said,

280
00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:03.050
kids off the street. We don't get bloated.

281
00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:11.330
She was like, I'm sorry, sorry. Sorry. She goes, anything else? And I go,

282
00:16:11.331 --> 00:16:13.880
are you clean? And she goes, you want to do this or not? And I was like,

283
00:16:13.881 --> 00:16:18.830
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. And then she just got new. It's a great note.

284
00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.280
I know that's one of the best no's I've ever heard. Oh, I know.

285
00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:26.420
I want to do this or not. I'm in sorry.

286
00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:31.310
Madam do a re redo and yes,

287
00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:35.810
under age 16. She's 50. What? 53.

288
00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.160
I gotta be more memorable.

289
00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.740
<v 2>Yeah. I just, probably just, I was probably thinking about myself. Sure. Um,</v>

290
00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:43.390
who is this? A couple of whites right here.

291
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.350
<v 0>And uh, uh, Rickles. Jose?</v>

292
00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:52.210
<v 2>Yeah. No, I think that's the Gore. And who? Yeah. Who does that look like?</v>

293
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.820
Who's that guy at the Shubert?

294
00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:59.260
<v 0>Um, maybe an old shoe. Who's the guy at the store opens it up. Alan Arkin.</v>

295
00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:02.590
What's that? Guy's name? Argus. Hamilton.

296
00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.480
<v 2>August Hamilton. Yeah.</v>

297
00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:09.460
Good on him named after obviously a couple of slaves. Let's be honest.

298
00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:11.003
Oh yeah.

299
00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:12.280
<v 0>Yeah. Good play.</v>

300
00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:18.640
<v 2>What's up Theo gang gang. We're a couple of Tuesdays.</v>

301
00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:23.850
No. About your best night and your worst night performing comedy. Oh,

302
00:17:23.851 --> 00:17:28.630
I got that for you. Thank you. Cute couple right there.

303
00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:29.643
Thank you guys.

304
00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:35.590
<v 0>Yeah. You want to start? Let's hear yours, man. All right. Well, one I've had a,</v>

305
00:17:35.591 --> 00:17:37.540
I've had a lot of great nights. I've had a lot of bad nights.

306
00:17:37.541 --> 00:17:41.440
It's hard to pick the top, but I did the, the, the, what is that?

307
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:45.730
What's the arena here? Staples. No, no, no, sir. Forum.

308
00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.700
I did the forum once and that was pretty unbelievable. I,

309
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:53.640
I just killed at the forum. I just had it. It was just sold out,

310
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.130
you know, open for Schumer. I don't know. What is that?

311
00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:00.840
30,000 people or whatever the it is. 20, 22, maybe 22. Yeah.

312
00:18:00.841 --> 00:18:04.830
It was unreal. And it's in a circle and just rocked it and it just,

313
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:05.760
everything clicked.

314
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:09.600
I did the Patrice O'Neal benefit and that was a good one with bill burn vitamin,

315
00:18:09.601 --> 00:18:10.680
which was like such an honor.

316
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.140
And that just clicked that I remember I went third,

317
00:18:13.141 --> 00:18:16.050
which is like the best spot in his show and just kicked,

318
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.230
kicked it right in the teeth. And it just, you know,

319
00:18:19.231 --> 00:18:23.370
when your timing is the laugh and then you, then it just worked. Um,

320
00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:27.150
and bill said some nice things after. So that was great. But the worst,

321
00:18:27.151 --> 00:18:31.640
probably two months ago during Christmas, uh,

322
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.900
did a bunch of corporate gigs. Do you do corporates?

323
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.480
I just did one this week actually. Oh, nice. They're pretty.

324
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:39.600
They're pretty different. They're not really stand up.

325
00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.480
You just kind of like trying to keep these people happy and get your paycheck

326
00:18:42.481 --> 00:18:46.040
and get out of there. You don't want to get any HR issues. Yes. Yes.

327
00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:49.860
And I that's exactly what I did. I had to host a pharmaceutical award show,

328
00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:55.290
big hotel ballroom, you know, like white tablecloth, fine China,

329
00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.950
tuxedos chandelier's and I'm hosting. I got no cards.

330
00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:03.300
It's like a stack this high of like next up best sleep aid.

331
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:07.440
Here are the nominees. Like I was that guy. I had a podium and everything,

332
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:10.860
and I had to study it and the paycheck was insane. They picked me up in a limo,

333
00:19:10.861 --> 00:19:13.350
drove me out to Philadelphia. I get there.

334
00:19:13.351 --> 00:19:16.890
I'm supposed to do 15 minutes of standup to open just to like get them loose and

335
00:19:16.891 --> 00:19:20.130
then go into the award shows clean, but they knew my stuff.

336
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.890
They watched all my YouTube and they're like, we like your edge and all that.

337
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:25.650
So just do you. So I just to play it safe.

338
00:19:25.651 --> 00:19:29.760
I did the sign I opened for Seinfeld and I did the Seinfeld set, which you know,

339
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:34.710
nothing cleaner than Seinfeld. Uh, so I go up and out of the gate,

340
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.140
BOM BOM by every joke. And I'm like, all right, well,

341
00:19:37.141 --> 00:19:40.260
let me pull out some heavy hitters. These always work bomb, foolproof bomb.

342
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.340
So I'm like, maybe I'll get a little dirtier. That'll tell, I'll get him. I go,

343
00:19:44.341 --> 00:19:46.050
I do a vibrator joke. I see it.

344
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.830
I'd see a table of women get up and leave in a Huff. And I go, Oh,

345
00:19:49.831 --> 00:19:54.540
that's not good. So I comment on them. Dry women, huh? Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

346
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.570
These women were not into it.

347
00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.410
And so I had my, my get off to like,

348
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:04.800
I bring these people up to like give a little speech about some kind of drugs

349
00:20:04.801 --> 00:20:08.670
they're selling and I get off. And the CEO of the whole thing is yelling at me.

350
00:20:08.671 --> 00:20:11.520
And he's like, how could you say that about my wife? And I'm like, wait,

351
00:20:11.521 --> 00:20:13.230
what are you doing? I don't even know who your wife is. And he's like,

352
00:20:13.231 --> 00:20:16.510
my wife is offended. Get the hell out of here. You're fired. You're done.

353
00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:19.110
I was like, wait, what, what are you talking about? I'm in a tuxedo.

354
00:20:19.111 --> 00:20:23.610
I rented a tux from Joseph, a banks. I'm like, what?

355
00:20:23.611 --> 00:20:26.700
So I go up to like the curator later and she's like, she's crying.

356
00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.400
Cause he yelled at her first and she's like, she's like, you gotta go.

357
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:29.791
You gotta go.

358
00:20:29.791 --> 00:20:32.700
We're going to find someone else to host it the whole three more hours in the

359
00:20:32.701 --> 00:20:36.120
show. And I just had to get in the car and go back to Philly. I mean,

360
00:20:36.121 --> 00:20:39.330
go back to New York, brutal. I studied and all this.

361
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.620
And it was like a fine lobster steak dinner. And it was like, so high end.

362
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:46.020
And this was a big production with like, you know,

363
00:20:46.021 --> 00:20:49.210
a sound booth and the lighting guy and the waiters, all this.

364
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:52.060
And I just had to leave. But, uh,

365
00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:57.190
Netflix is literally has a credo. They'll tell you, Oh yeah, they have quotas.

366
00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.880
They're locked in. You have a TV show. We have an Asian director.

367
00:21:00.881 --> 00:21:04.090
We have a woman director in his own. He's not, doesn't matter. It's it's,

368
00:21:04.091 --> 00:21:08.770
it's less about, I think what happened in your,

369
00:21:08.771 --> 00:21:11.080
so I had two good pitches before that.

370
00:21:11.081 --> 00:21:13.210
So it was loose and I was zigging and zagging and I was,

371
00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:17.110
I was on and we were in there with the Netflix guy and we couldn't get the video

372
00:21:17.111 --> 00:21:20.200
to work, to play the sizzle. And it was just showing like the ceiling and I go,

373
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:23.500
Oh, that's the Kevin Hart sex table. I'm trying to make jokes. And the guy goes,

374
00:21:23.501 --> 00:21:26.260
can you believe that the woman is suing him for that? I was like, well,

375
00:21:26.261 --> 00:21:28.360
I think it's the best thing he's ever done. Yeah.

376
00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.350
If it's funniest funny than it's specials. And he was like, you know what?

377
00:21:31.351 --> 00:21:35.680
I produced the last four of those. I was like, Oh, well I'm just, just around.

378
00:21:35.681 --> 00:21:37.270
You know, we all love Kevin Hart. And he's like,

379
00:21:37.271 --> 00:21:40.180
I don't think that's appropriate. I mean, he does. He works with Netflix.

380
00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:43.630
I'm like, Oh yeah, I'm just a calm, just busting ball. I love Kevin Hart.

381
00:21:43.631 --> 00:21:44.411
I wish I was him.

382
00:21:44.411 --> 00:21:49.390
He's a little guy and cute and all that pets to go see it, blah, blah, blah.

383
00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.090
And he just the whole pitch,

384
00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.200
I just poured my heart out in this pit shucking and jiving I'm tap dancing.

385
00:21:56.201 --> 00:21:59.440
And he was just like, take, take a joke.

386
00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.050
That's the whole day doing something right there. Aren't they,

387
00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:06.980
I got mugged a bunch, but uh, yeah. So I, you know,

388
00:22:06.981 --> 00:22:10.320
I was boozing it up in Cleveland, you know, not bragging.

389
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:14.580
And um, I met this gal. This is years ago, years ago.

390
00:22:14.581 --> 00:22:16.500
And I remember thinking like, all right,

391
00:22:16.501 --> 00:22:18.960
I'm going to be a good guy here and try to do the right thing.

392
00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.450
We don't have a condom. So we can't bang. You know,

393
00:22:21.451 --> 00:22:24.720
I'm trying to be a little more responsible and where my hotel room and we're

394
00:22:24.721 --> 00:22:27.780
both kind of, Oh, what do we do in Cleveland? That everything closes.

395
00:22:27.781 --> 00:22:30.030
It's all done. So I was like,

396
00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:33.120
I got an idea because we were both wanting to do something. I go,

397
00:22:33.121 --> 00:22:36.240
what if I put it in the Keester? We won't need a condom for that.

398
00:22:36.241 --> 00:22:40.200
You can't get pregnant in the. Not that I've heard. I didn't know of.

399
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:42.840
That was the case in gays would be having babies.

400
00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:43.673
<v 1>A little bit.</v>

401
00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:49.830
<v 0>So that would also you're you're what you're not considering is Sylvia STI</v>

402
00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:53.880
think about it. I was like the baby's all you're thinking about.

403
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.550
<v 1>Yeah. Cause what STD lives in the air. Yeah.</v>

404
00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:03.300
Especially the big, the big Hills. So

405
00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:07.380
this was the responsible thing to do.

406
00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.070
<v 0>Uh, she was like, all right, great.</v>

407
00:23:11.071 --> 00:23:14.430
So we went to town and I remember thinking like, alright, you gotta pee after.

408
00:23:14.431 --> 00:23:16.470
That's how you flush everything. I was really,

409
00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:21.390
really trying to be responsible and whatever, when, uh, we,

410
00:23:21.391 --> 00:23:25.680
I don't know if you ever had an STD. No. It hits you about two weeks.

411
00:23:25.681 --> 00:23:30.000
It's usually like 13, 14 days. That's how long it takes to really notice it.

412
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:34.770
And I remember the next day I was like, God what I got a next day. Yeah.

413
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:37.680
It was like, so I was like this in my head. I was like,

414
00:23:37.681 --> 00:23:38.790
this is a really bad one.

415
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.590
<v 1>You know, they didn't do that early.</v>

416
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.260
<v 0>That's what my dumb brain thought like this is a really serious STD.</v>

417
00:23:45.261 --> 00:23:47.660
So immediately I went AIDS. You go right to the top.

418
00:23:47.661 --> 00:23:50.690
And then he does a lot of gay or, uh, anal AIDS. You know,

419
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:55.670
this was a one night stand, correct? Yes. And the anal first date.

420
00:23:55.820 --> 00:24:00.320
Yeah. Anal that's Cleveland one night. Is there? Yeah, that's a Wednesday.

421
00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:05.450
It's the Browns Cleveland Browns baby. I was the mascot.

422
00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:10.130
Wow. So, uh, yeah. Yeah. I, I, I had to do the horrible thing.

423
00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:14.240
We all hate to do you text the girl next day, go, Hey, I hate to do this,

424
00:24:14.241 --> 00:24:18.350
but do you have anything I should know about? You know? And uh, she was like,

425
00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.980
Oh my God, of course not. Geez. How could yes. And it's just super awkward.

426
00:24:21.981 --> 00:24:24.890
I'm like, all right. I just feel weird. And something's up. I'm just checking.

427
00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:29.540
No, no, no judgment. And she's like, no, no, you, whatever. And I was like,

428
00:24:29.541 --> 00:24:33.170
all right. And then, you know, the next couple of days, it's like, yeah, I am.

429
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:35.540
I have something bad happening.

430
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:40.190
Just aching in your Dick in there in it,

431
00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.940
in it. Does it burn when you pee pee?

432
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:49.220
Have you it again yourself? You, I guess hurt.

433
00:24:49.221 --> 00:24:52.400
When that came out. I was too worried about it. I didn't want to with it.

434
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:56.990
So I was pee and it didn't burn you. The burn is the big tail. That's the,

435
00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:01.190
that's the go-to. So this was a no burn and an ache and a pain and a sting.

436
00:25:01.191 --> 00:25:05.880
So I'm like, so I thought it was some high level, you know,

437
00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:10.820
it's only in your Dick. Yes. It's not radiating in anywhere else. No radiation.

438
00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:15.710
And, uh, I, I I'm losing it. So I go to the hospital and like the,

439
00:25:15.711 --> 00:25:19.490
what do you call it? The clinic, the one hour clinic. And I do a whole test.

440
00:25:19.491 --> 00:25:22.370
They go, you're clean. And I go, well, I got some something's up.

441
00:25:22.371 --> 00:25:24.920
And they're like, ah, it's probably in your head. And they're like,

442
00:25:24.921 --> 00:25:29.870
take some antibiotic bugs. That's what my. So it was like,

443
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:32.270
all right, so I'm taking it and you know, nothing's working.

444
00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:34.010
So I know this Dr. Guy,

445
00:25:34.011 --> 00:25:38.000
so I just called him and it just kinda like unloaded on him. And he goes, huh?

446
00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:43.670
I bet you got in your Dick. That's not the box. That's what the doc,

447
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.050
I just used the word.

448
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.880
Yeah. And I was like, I don't know.

449
00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.590
<v 2>You ever take that ferry over there from new Orleans over to the West westbound?</v>

450
00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.470
Yeah, sure. Mardi Gras world. That we'd go there. Yeah.

451
00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:01.870
I used to take that with my dad all the time. I love that ferry.

452
00:26:01.871 --> 00:26:05.680
It was like a buck. Yeah. That was good times. Yeah. That thing was good.

453
00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:09.550
Never cost a dollar to get into new Orleans from the West bank. Every day.

454
00:26:09.551 --> 00:26:13.000
Those my friends have to pay a buck to get into the city. They got rid of that,

455
00:26:13.001 --> 00:26:17.440
but that was weird as a kid, like, that's kind of to the wankers. Yeah.

456
00:26:17.441 --> 00:26:20.480
It really is kind of, yeah. You gotta pay to get in here. Yeah.

457
00:26:20.481 --> 00:26:23.080
You have to come over there to work and you also gotta pay. Yeah.

458
00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:26.020
It was like that coming from Mandeville was like you had to pay. Yeah, it was,

459
00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:30.810
uh, it was a dollar and then it was a dollar 50 on each side, Dan,

460
00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:35.050
eventually it was just $3 one way. So the other way you didn't have to stop.

461
00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:38.350
You gonna pay $3 up top, longest bridge in America. Yup.

462
00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:42.580
I think it was the longest bridge in the world for a while.

463
00:26:42.581 --> 00:26:44.190
And then Japanese built one longer.

464
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:47.820
<v 0>I got caught on that bridge. Uh, but not to get murdered.</v>

465
00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.490
I don't know if you've heard about this, but, uh,

466
00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.140
we were stopped on the Causeway. Cause I,

467
00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:55.140
we were getting chased by this guy who was trying to kill us,

468
00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:56.700
me and a couple of high school friends.

469
00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:00.240
And there was an accident on the Causeway, so it was gridlocked.

470
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:02.070
So the car had to park and we're like.

471
00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.370
And he got out and he was like shaking the car. He was like a big buff guy.

472
00:27:05.371 --> 00:27:07.980
And we were like three squirrely Catholic school kids.

473
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.370
And he had a knife and he was like slicing the side of the car up.

474
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:16.230
And luckily the cops at the rec saw it and like tased him and pulled him down

475
00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:18.750
and cuffed him. Oh, that's amazing. It was wild. But I was like,

476
00:27:18.751 --> 00:27:20.880
go on the Causeway. He won't follow it because it's too long.

477
00:27:20.881 --> 00:27:24.060
But then there was a wreck that Causeway man,

478
00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:27.120
cause to me that was a whole nother world over there where you live. I was like,

479
00:27:27.121 --> 00:27:31.080
I don't know what goes on in Covington and Mandeville and all that. That was a,

480
00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:32.190
I didn't know what that was.
