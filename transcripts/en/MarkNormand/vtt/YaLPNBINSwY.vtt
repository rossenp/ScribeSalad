WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.720
<v 0>All right here. We are at the Dallas improv.</v>

2
00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:08.460
This is my first standup set back in like 84, uh,

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.950
84 days. I got,

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.400
I just put a special out to all my materials gone.

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.220
It'd be one thing that I could come back on stage is jumping in my old act,

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.370
but I just put out an act. I put out on YouTube, it's all out there.

7
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.990
So now I got no material and no skills. So I wrote just a ton of.

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.880
I got Corona, I got riots. I got anal. I mean, you name it.

9
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.110
And, uh, I'm terrified. I'm rusty. And I have new material.

10
00:00:34.111 --> 00:00:38.940
That's not fleshed out. This is going to be a disaster. And uh,

11
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.170
I want you to all watch it and be there with me, but this is going to be ugly.

12
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.950
But the witness, a big bomb folks. Yeah,

13
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:51.930
the pandemic's got nothing on this show right here is going

14
00:00:51.931 --> 00:00:56.160
to be bad. And we got 25% capacity. You know, the whole thing is,

15
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.880
this is just a bad situation. It's good to get ugly, Phil.

16
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:00.714
Let's see what happens.

17
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.620
<v 1>Yay comedy. Huh? All right. We're really doing it. Thanks for coming out.</v>

18
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.350
Cleavage, shoulders. How are you doing there? I love the hoops.

19
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.460
Love a lady with hoops.

20
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.640
You can always tell a crazy woman is by the size of her hoops. Right?

21
00:01:13.641 --> 00:01:18.050
That's where this comes from. Somebody write that down.

22
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.860
Just thought of that. Oh right. And don't worry. I'm not cheating here.

23
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.870
These just because I've drawn. Here you go.

24
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.870
Eh. Yep. Yep. And I hope I'm not, I don't mean to offend anybody.

25
00:01:29.871 --> 00:01:32.060
If you are offended, just, you know, kill yourself.

26
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.740
But like now you're allowed to be offended. I'm just joking. But you know, uh,

27
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.740
Hey, welcome back speaking. And taking a. Uh,

28
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.990
ah,

29
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.900
worked so hard on that phone, Booz joking, but I was like, yeah, that's cute.

30
00:01:50.901 --> 00:01:51.860
Then I do the joke.

31
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.390
That's why comedy is a kick in the taint that, but it's honest.

32
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.290
I appreciate the honesty. You're all good eggs.

33
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.890
<v 0>Big fan. I might've heard it.</v>

34
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.950
Thank you. Hey,

35
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.510
thanks for coming out. Get it here. There we go.

36
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.030
No touching tattoos. I'll call you.

37
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.670
I appreciate you. Thank you. Thanks for watching and a hair.

38
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.740
<v 1>There's a bunch of schools right by my apartment.</v>

39
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.140
I live in New York and all there's all these schools that live in like a school

40
00:02:39.141 --> 00:02:41.510
district. There's like a school for engineering.

41
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.530
There's a school for beauty school, for our carpentry.

42
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.010
There's even a school for retarded people, which is great.

43
00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:52.280
I'm like who would send their kid to a school to learn, to be retarded.

44
00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.490
I tried a new one. Um, retard.

45
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:05.290
It's tough. You're really walking a tough line there with the retard jokes.

46
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.060
I thought I could do it. I'll figure that one out.

47
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:13.390
Don't you worry. At the end of the weekend, that retard,

48
00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:17.950
school's going to be cooking. Say, look,

49
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.090
I'm 85 days out of standup here folks. So, uh,

50
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.590
my Dick cannot get hard comedically. I'm working on it. All right.

51
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.120
By the way, I went to a gay wedding in January. So fun unwell. Any gay?

52
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.133
Any gays here?

53
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.780
Well now one gay guy to his case. All right.

54
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:42.070
Yeah. Yeah. Not one that is statistically impossible, but all right. Um,

55
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.330
right now there's some guy in the back, like,

56
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.380
should this be the time I come out?

57
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.210
Uh, yeah. Big fan, big fan of the gaze. You know, uh,

58
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.110
I read some article gay marriages raked up

59
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.550
3.8 billion for the country. How cool is that? Yeah.

60
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.240
Gays are to married with Blackboard of sports, you know,

61
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.900
take it to another level. You're the best at it.

62
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.070
All right. That's something there. I got to figure that one out. it.

63
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.680
<v 0>Second show was a little rowdy, got heckled. A lot of drunk.</v>

64
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.210
Some people wouldn't shut up and it was like, right.

65
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.210
I was right back in it. You know, you with the guy. You yell out.

66
00:04:30.211 --> 00:04:33.660
If you call the horrible insult, his girlfriend tells him to shut up.

67
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.380
You're embarrassing. The, you know, classic, uh,

68
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.580
the beauty of Corona and the riots and all that is that we all know what I'm

69
00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:44.400
talking about. You know, sometimes you tell a joke and somebody is like,

70
00:04:44.401 --> 00:04:47.250
I don't know what it's like to have sex with a dog. You know,

71
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.220
why would I care about that? But Corona and everything, you can,

72
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.950
we're all on board. Then a lot of these will tack,

73
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.600
but that's what it's all about.

74
00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.360
I wrote a whole new batch of jokes that I'm sure will eat their own up there.

75
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.490
<v 1>We're such a weird country.</v>

76
00:05:02.491 --> 00:05:04.740
It's weird how we can only support one group at a time.

77
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.230
Like right now we're like trying to help black people two years ago.

78
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.240
It was me too. It was a women. What about women who still get with, yeah.

79
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.610
Now it's like, Hey, I'm a woman. I just got sexually assaulted. Hey,

80
00:05:14.611 --> 00:05:18.540
shut up sister. We're on black. Now we can only do one of the time.

81
00:05:18.541 --> 00:05:22.170
What about trans rights? That's so 2019 nerd. I got,

82
00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:25.170
I'm just trying to help a buddy. All right. Oh, checks are coming around.

83
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.830
This audience has got the attention span of a net. Dick.

84
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.580
<v 0>Saturday night, Dallas. We did two shows. Both were killer crowds are great,</v>

85
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.590
great town, nice people,

86
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.960
good eggs at a couple of whiskeys. And, uh,

87
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.160
I should go out and hit the town, but I'm done. I'm gone in,

88
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.930
we got one show tomorrow and, uh, that'll do it for the weekend. And I'm saying,

89
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.410
I'm sad to end it. I used to look at comedy.

90
00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.320
I got so routine it be. I flew up, flew out every weekend and

91
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.600
we got to do shows at night. Here's the hotel.

92
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.130
And now I didn't realize what I had. I love it. I take it.

93
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.570
I took it for granted. Now I'm grateful. I've hit the residents in.

94
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:16.243
We're going to bed.

95
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.400
I'll rub one out to a stormy Daniels and galled a

96
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.170
global life. You want to join?

97
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.210
Like as much as I.

98
00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.300
<v 1>On this, uh, this country of ours, I think it's still pretty good. You know,</v>

99
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.930
you know, this country is great. 90 day. Fiance.

100
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.740
You ever seen this? When you look at some of the ghouls,

101
00:06:38.741 --> 00:06:43.240
people are willing to just to get a taste of America. You're like,

102
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.280
we must have it. Pretty good. Huh?

103
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.900
Some is willing to let a guy with no neck inside of her just to get a taste of

104
00:06:49.901 --> 00:06:54.820
Detroit. Like, all right. That's quite a nation. We got here.

105
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.690
We're getting there. We're getting there. Yeah. You guys are catching on.

106
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.080
You guys are all right. This crowds like anal takes a minute. You know,

107
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:08.080
after a while you're like, ah, I love it. Here we are in the, uh,

108
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:12.850
the hotel room, a lot of semen, some lotion,

109
00:07:12.851 --> 00:07:16.270
somewhere. Best deodorant. Stand behind it.

110
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.970
Hey Corona. Now some businesses are opening with curbside pickup.

111
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:26.410
Prostitute said, Hey, we've been doing that the whole time. All right,

112
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.940
we'll try it. We'll give it a whirl. So, uh, hopefully there's a crowd tonight.

113
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.530
And uh, yeah, we'll, we'll yuck it up and probably offend somebody,

114
00:07:35.531 --> 00:07:40.120
but it's sold out. Isn't it sold out? I didn't know that.

115
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:45.040
Oh my God. Well.

116
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.660
<v 0>Let's go do some comedy</v>

117
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.340
made this walk back pretty drunk.

118
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.220
When needed the rope for you now.

119
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:41.020
<v 1>Dressed some of the going on in the world. So many good looking people here.</v>

120
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:44.470
Well, not you, not you, but a couple of pretty healthy,

121
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.470
beautiful people in this town. You guys are underrated. Just beautiful ladies.

122
00:08:50.471 --> 00:08:53.080
You know, like I traveled the country. There's a lot of,

123
00:08:53.081 --> 00:08:57.420
a lot of fatties up there, you know? And we're fed country. That's all right.

124
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:00.720
You know, we're fed, we love food. We're obsessed with food.

125
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:05.760
All the factories in America have closed except cheesecake. Okay. That's it.

126
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:07.320
That's the only one that made it. Yeah.

127
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.590
These poor kids that got to go to school at home. Now they're all homeschooled.

128
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:11.700
You know, that's sad.

129
00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:14.880
How long until a teacher in Florida has cyber sex with one of her students,

130
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.920
you know, what's going to happen. Any Jews here

131
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.920
either. There are no Jews here or Jews are like,

132
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.090
I'm not falling for that one again.

133
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:36.840
No, those days are over.

134
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:44.030
<v 0>We did it. It's all over. I need more material. I suck.</v>

135
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:48.140
Uh, I'm starting out killing. And then it just

136
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.270
goes right to the shitbox, but I'll get it together.

137
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.540
That's why you do these gigs to get more material. God it.

138
00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:03.680
Hey, I wish you were my parents. Hey.

139
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:11.750
Hey, great frames. Hey, there he is. Hey,

140
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:16.760
thanks. Thanks God. It works

141
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:26.210
a good weekend. It's all over five shows in the bag,

142
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.610
a rusty as hell for a show,

143
00:10:28.611 --> 00:10:31.880
but I'll tell you it all snaps right back in once you're up there and you're

144
00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:36.470
feeling it, you're blowing baby. Woo. That was good to get back in there.

145
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.280
And now I feel like I got a cocaine bump and I got to go back to New York where

146
00:10:40.281 --> 00:10:43.040
there's no comedy again. So I want to have withdrawals all over again,

147
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:45.290
but I got a little fix. So that was fun.

148
00:10:45.291 --> 00:10:48.320
I got a lot of work done and tried some new jokes. Boy, it was great.

149
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:50.390
Just a tough time.

150
00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:54.380
New special came out and I'm rusty and I'm doing new material.

151
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.610
So I'm all over the road. But, uh, that was great. Crowds were great.

152
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.030
I loved Texas. And now I got to fly back to New York.

153
00:11:02.031 --> 00:11:05.630
So I'm gonna hit the bar and drank with the staff and the local comics.

154
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.800
One of the treats of doing comedies, hanging out with comics. So, uh,

155
00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.640
let's go get drunk. Okay. Anyone else hard.
