WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.250
<v 0>I did I bombed, I feel horrible about it. I have a story. I have a great story,</v>

2
00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:07.680
but it had no ending. And Ari was like, all you need is a good ending.

3
00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:09.810
Just don't worry about the story. Have a good ending. What's the story.

4
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.660
I had sex with my screenwriting teacher and, uh,

5
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.290
I worked at a New York film Academy and one of the teachers there,

6
00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:19.560
it's a long story, but, uh, basically my showered and work in crown Heights.

7
00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:23.010
So I was, I went like a week without showering. I smelled like. My boss said,

8
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.240
you gotta shower. You can't come in. And so I was going around, hold on,

9
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.210
hold on one second.

10
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.160
You literally do the shower to the point where people were like, yeah,

11
00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:31.994
it was bad.

12
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.020
I couldn't do it because I was doing sets at night and then I'd wake up.

13
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.171
You know,

14
00:00:36.171 --> 00:00:38.390
you gotta get home at three in the morning and you have to wake up at seven for

15
00:00:38.391 --> 00:00:41.150
work. So, you know, we run out of there and we had no hot water.

16
00:00:41.151 --> 00:00:43.790
We had no electricity in our apartment every now and then.

17
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.690
So it was snowing out. It was too cold to take a cold shower. And uh,

18
00:00:47.691 --> 00:00:50.690
so eventually I put a bucking pot on the stove.

19
00:00:50.691 --> 00:00:52.340
I boiled it in the dark and I was like,

20
00:00:52.341 --> 00:00:55.520
I'm just going to take a horseback in the kitchen, get it over with the lights,

21
00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:59.480
click on. After I done showering my roommate, cook stove,

22
00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:01.850
top stuffing in the, in the pot.

23
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.740
So I've now covered in BEO and like spices and. And, well,

24
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.250
it was too late. I had to go to work. So I had to run out

25
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.650
Thanksgiving. So I remember getting on the train. It was the four train.

26
00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:17.660
It was all, you know, I was the only white guy in black guys,

27
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.080
like standing over like sniffing me

28
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.120
stuffy. I put a pot on, I filled it with water and out. It was dark.

29
00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:32.540
So I didn't know it was covered for corn nuts and cornbread

30
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.690
smell. Now I smell like a home cooked meal.

31
00:01:38.691 --> 00:01:43.100
Yeah, it was brutal. Now I'm desperate. I get to work.

32
00:01:43.101 --> 00:01:46.370
I'm covered in this film. And I got like a little parsley pieces on me.

33
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.480
So I go up to everybody and one lady, the screenwriting teacher,

34
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.340
Mrs. Fritz, we'll call her. I go, Hey, look, can I shower your place? She goes,

35
00:01:55.341 --> 00:01:57.980
sure. I don't care. And I was like, Oh my God. She was like, kind of cute,

36
00:01:57.981 --> 00:02:02.780
like 40, 40 year old quirky, weird earrings, big beehive kind of thing, hairdo.

37
00:02:02.781 --> 00:02:06.620
And uh, she was like, yeah, sure. Just come over. But I'm having a dinner party.

38
00:02:06.621 --> 00:02:09.740
It's at eight. So if you don't mind getting out of it, I was like, you got it,

39
00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:13.760
whatever. So I get there like six, I bring a bottle of wine to be nice.

40
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.520
I get there. She has a beautiful apartment in Brooklyn,

41
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.250
all like a spread on the table.

42
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.020
Just crazy set up dishes, glassware, the placemats. And I'm like,

43
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.200
Oh my God. She's like eight things going on. The stove bubbling. I'm like,

44
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.720
Oh my God, she's really doing this. So I get in, I go, Hey, look,

45
00:02:29.721 --> 00:02:32.260
I'll take a shower. I'll be out of your hair. No problem. She goes, sure, sure.

46
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.100
We'll have a glass of wine. We don't really know each other.

47
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.520
I have a glass of wine. We have two glasses of wine, three last one.

48
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.490
We're talking about life and love and philosophy. We're going at it.

49
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.480
And I was like, look, it's it's seven, 10. I gotta get in that shower. She goes,

50
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.700
all right. All right. Well, are you hungry? And I'm like,

51
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.490
I guess I'll have a bowl. She made paella. I was like, yeah,

52
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.700
I haven't eaten good. In three weeks. I'll take a bowl of pious.

53
00:02:52.701 --> 00:02:55.220
And now I'm eating the pie. We have another glass of wine. I'm like, Hey look,

54
00:02:55.221 --> 00:02:57.470
lady at seven 30. I got to get the hell out of,

55
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.340
you're having a dinner party at eight. So she's like, all right. All right.

56
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:02.020
So I get in the shower and I'm hammered at this point.

57
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:04.810
I meant like six glasses of wine. And we're being in the shower,

58
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.050
washing my body and be like, this is so nice. And then I go,

59
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.530
am I going to this woman now? What are you kidding? Get out of here. It's,

60
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.840
you know, 20 minutes. So people show up.

61
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.350
So I got out the shower and I was like seven 48. You know, I'm like scurrying,

62
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:19.810
like, all right, I gotta go. Thank you. And she goes, I have one more glass.

63
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:23.350
I'm like, all right. And she's like, let me give you a tour of the apartment.

64
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.930
We're walking around our apartment. She's showing me knickknacks and whatever.

65
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.740
Now we're standing up on her couch looking at a painting on the wall. And, uh,

66
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:32.350
we're both looking at, we were like face to face and she goes, uh,

67
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:36.790
you know what? And I go, what's that? She goes, I want you to come in my face,

68
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.930
swear to God. I want you to come in my face. And I go, all right.

69
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.330
And now we're just going at it. We're on the floor,

70
00:03:43.331 --> 00:03:48.160
rolling around knocking coffee tables over and all this just. And, uh,

71
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.280
she pulled the string or something and all the lights went out in her apartment

72
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.060
and we're just going at it. And it was nighttime, just hot, dark sex.

73
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.750
I wake up the next morning, there's blood everywhere. She was,

74
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.380
she was on her period. And I mean, I just didn't notice it because of the dark.

75
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.590
It was just beat red crime scene thing.

76
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.530
And I had worked the next morning. So I just had to like,

77
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.160
so I went from being the cleanest I've ever been to now I'm covered in uterine

78
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:16.720
lining. So I had to just put on clothes and go, go to work. And, uh,

79
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.060
I remember on the way out, she was like, don't you tell anybody? And I was like,

80
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.550
all right, I won't. And I, of course I told everybody right when I got there.

81
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.210
But, uh, yeah, that was it. That was my story. Right.

82
00:04:25.211 --> 00:04:26.980
I should have done the podcast, you know.

83
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.900
<v 1>The late night. Why did I do that? Yeah. Why,</v>

84
00:04:30.901 --> 00:04:35.880
why did I go on Carson daily when I could have just how many

85
00:04:35.881 --> 00:04:39.060
late nights have you done? 12. I think. Wow. And all of them bad.

86
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.100
Some really they're all funny.

87
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.300
<v 0>I'm good. No, I had my last one was rough and I lost sleep over it.</v>

88
00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:47.700
I'm like punching walls in a hotel room in Sacramento. Like,

89
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.130
why did I pick that joke? Why did I do that?

90
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.430
<v 1>Why am I in Sacramento? No, I feel, I know what you mean. Uh,</v>

91
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.480
when you feel like you do a set that you're bummed about, or yeah, I get it,

92
00:04:57.481 --> 00:05:00.510
but I I'm not placating. I would, I would not mention it,

93
00:05:00.511 --> 00:05:03.600
but I truly think I haven't seen you have a bag. Bad set on.

94
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.390
<v 0>Hi. Hey, I appreciate it. I appreciate it. I did one.</v>

95
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.230
So I did my half hour comedy, central special, whatever that was bad.

96
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.240
That was bad. Cause I had a, I got a virus called H pylori and I was like,

97
00:05:15.241 --> 00:05:17.130
I gotta change the date. They're like, we can't change the date.

98
00:05:17.131 --> 00:05:19.530
So I had to do it. If you look on the internet, I'm puffy. I'm like,

99
00:05:19.531 --> 00:05:21.720
my face is this big wedding. Laurie,

100
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.600
it's a virus you get from eating feces.

101
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.490
And I ate some fat chicks and Wisconsin. And uh,

102
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.500
I guess I got some fecal matter in me and uh, totally shut me down.

103
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.230
Wow. I was like, my tongue was sheet white.

104
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.490
I was spitting up like Hawks of whatever my, I was water.

105
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.300
I had a stomach ache. I mean, I was weak. It really got me.

106
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.620
That was cheese had chicks. I know, I know she didn't wipe enough. I assume.

107
00:05:49.621 --> 00:05:53.160
I mean, I think even when I went back there, she was like, you're crazy.

108
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.010
You're taking your life in your hands and you a big eater. I, you know, it was,

109
00:05:58.011 --> 00:06:00.380
it was like six years ago when it was like just, Oh,

110
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.570
and it just started raining. It was a trend. Yeah. It was a trend.

111
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:06.500
And I wanted to show like, Hey, I'm down. I'm pro women, you know,

112
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:08.630
I'll eat your. Yeah. That's true. Religion jeans on.

113
00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:10.960
And you were all with the hip trends. You have affliction shirt. And like,

114
00:06:10.961 --> 00:06:14.450
I mean that pal, you got that right. Whenever it comes around, I'm going for it.

115
00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:17.660
Yeah. So you learned your lesson now. I learned my lesson. I came up,

116
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.550
it looked like I had a, like a candy Apple.

117
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.240
I was covered in chocolate and a boy, I learned my lesson now.

118
00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:26.270
I only kids' asses. Right? Yeah. It's gotta be clean.

119
00:06:26.271 --> 00:06:29.350
I get a baby wipe in there because they've just been cleaned. Right, right.

120
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.370
Exactly. After tub time. Is that what it is?

121
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.000
Tough time for nap hour two.

122
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.950
And then I look and then I put baby powder on it.

123
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.880
I could go on all day about a statutory.

124
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.800
<v 2>Reading it.</v>

125
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.290
I was reading an article this morning about gender differences and stuff.

126
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.260
It was actually a book review. And I thought, and the,

127
00:06:47.261 --> 00:06:49.120
the conclusion that Orica was, well,

128
00:06:49.121 --> 00:06:51.550
we're more symbol than we are different as human beings, men and women.

129
00:06:51.551 --> 00:06:54.040
It's like, no kidding. Yes. We,

130
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.840
we are just about exactly the same creatures with these distinct. Yes.

131
00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:59.733
Yes.

132
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:04.570
There's some distinctness qualities biologically that just are jut.

133
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.330
We have a bigger corporates callosum. We have to, they have bigger clothes.

134
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.690
They have a better brain. They have better brains. They live longer.

135
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:11.703
They have eggs.

136
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.750
<v 0>Yeah. Know, there's clear differences. Yeah.</v>

137
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.450
<v 2>No, there are differences in it. And it has an effect.</v>

138
00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.510
Now we're much more alike than we are different. Sure.

139
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.520
Except where we're different, which is.

140
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.120
<v 0>And we're different and it's okay. And I like the differences.</v>

141
00:07:25.121 --> 00:07:29.380
I like a hips and a small waist and a big nipple in a, you know,

142
00:07:29.381 --> 00:07:33.940
a bald vet talking about me that way. Anyone else hard?

143
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:36.760
<v 2>So, so.</v>

144
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.570
<v 0>No, I mean, you still gotta be a comedian at the end of the day. So talk,</v>

145
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.320
tell me about when you got caught, how did you get, Oh boy, it was brutal, man.

146
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:45.243
It was, uh,

147
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:49.570
like I phones were still kinda new and I was in the shower and I was always on

148
00:07:49.571 --> 00:07:52.990
edge, you know, like I got an, almost caught like 800 times,

149
00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:57.790
but gotten out of it cheated a lot. Yeah. Pretty much every weekend. Yeah.

150
00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:00.940
It was bad. Cause we weren't, cause we were, we were sick of each other,

151
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.280
but it was still like you shouldn't cheat and uh,

152
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:07.540
almost got caught a bunch and uh, I would just deny, deny, deny.

153
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.710
And then I'm in the shower one day. Everything's going great, good relationship.

154
00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.310
Birds are chirping sun's out. And I'm showering up whistling.

155
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.460
And my phone lit lights up on the coffee table.

156
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.100
She's watching TV and a naked picture pops up.

157
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:26.080
And it's some blonde chick that I banged, who knows where. And uh,

158
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:30.220
she, I know passcode then, cause it was kind of a new phone and I,

159
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:34.450
she opens it up and starts reading the thread and it was like, well we did this.

160
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.730
And when we did that and it was so hot and I want to do this again.

161
00:08:36.731 --> 00:08:41.320
I want to gargle that and suck on this and swallow that and all and just be

162
00:08:41.321 --> 00:08:45.310
saying like I can't wait to do this again and pull that and yank that and fix

163
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.300
this. And uh, so the bathroom door kicks open.

164
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.780
She pulls the curtain back and I remember being like, Hey, coming in.

165
00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:54.960
And uh,

166
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.050
she just showed me the phone and it was the picture of the naked girl and to

167
00:08:58.051 --> 00:09:01.770
drop the phone in the tub and I'm like, Oh. So I grabbed the phone,

168
00:09:01.771 --> 00:09:05.340
I jumped out naked. I'm just like in the living room, like, Hey, come on.

169
00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:08.580
What are you crazy? Get out of here. No, no she's not her. And she's like,

170
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:11.880
I read the whole thing. you. I knew I knew it. I knew it. And um, you know,

171
00:09:11.881 --> 00:09:14.880
you're naked when you're naked, you look, you look like an idiot, you know,

172
00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:19.280
you're naked and wet. It's like the flip-flop serum. Oh yeah, there you go.

173
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.870
Was it after that? And then we tried to work it out, but it was never the same.

174
00:09:23.871 --> 00:09:27.350
And six months later was done and I, sorry,

175
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:30.200
we lived together and I just moved out and I was like, keep the place.

176
00:09:30.201 --> 00:09:32.840
I paid half the rent. Just try to be a good guy out of guilt.

177
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:37.490
And I just couch surf for like a year. Yeah. I everything in that year. I mean,

178
00:09:37.491 --> 00:09:39.950
I, uh, I banged a chicken, a homeless shelter.

179
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:43.010
I was going on the road as much as I could. It was a

180
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:48.680
crazy story. I was a, I met a girl to show, I got her number.

181
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.570
We met up like a week later,

182
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:54.080
I went to a bar called alligator lounge where you get a free pizza with every

183
00:09:54.081 --> 00:09:55.610
drink. So I met up,

184
00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.580
met up with his girl and she's just wolfing down these pizza slices,

185
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.180
putting them down. She was like a cute blonde chick. And uh, I was like,

186
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.300
you all right? She's like, Oh, I gotta be honest. I'm homeless. And I go, what?

187
00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.850
I'm homeless. So, uh,

188
00:10:07.851 --> 00:10:11.210
we started bonding on the homeless thing and then she told me she's in a shelter

189
00:10:11.211 --> 00:10:13.100
and I'm like, Oh, so we're making out, we're making out.

190
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.420
And then she pulls me away and goes,

191
00:10:14.421 --> 00:10:17.540
wouldn't it be crazy if we went to my shelter and I was like, yeah, yeah,

192
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.020
go back to Megan. I'll go back and make an out pounding, booze, pounding booze.

193
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.000
Before I know it. We're in a cab on the way to the shelter.

194
00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.750
And that's a funny moment by the way, being in a cab to a homeless shelter.

195
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:32.120
So we get there it's way out in Brooklyn, big stone building. And she's like,

196
00:10:32.121 --> 00:10:34.580
I just realized they're not going to let you in. It's pretty regulated.

197
00:10:34.581 --> 00:10:37.670
You know? So, uh, this has guy in the front,

198
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:41.200
you have to like be buzzed into this huge gate, big metal gate that slides open.

199
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:46.160
He goes, ah, you know, so, uh, she has this big hobo key to the shelter.

200
00:10:46.161 --> 00:10:49.550
It's like a key with a, like a hubcap on it. And uh, she's like,

201
00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.670
maybe you could go in and just act like you own the place going with the sh the

202
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.240
key and just walk right in and you won't have to sign in. I was like, all right,

203
00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.450
that's that's good. So I go in, I go up homeless, you know,

204
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.470
tough riding the rails and I'm swinging the key. And the guy's like, yeah, yeah,

205
00:11:03.471 --> 00:11:06.620
whatever. It's four in the morning. And uh, she just walks in and goes, Hey,

206
00:11:06.621 --> 00:11:09.920
I'll sign in. Cause she's actually there. So they know her. So she goes,

207
00:11:09.921 --> 00:11:13.250
whatever you do, don't get caught. I'm on the third floor on the women's floor.

208
00:11:13.251 --> 00:11:15.650
You get caught on the women's floor. You'll go to jail. Cause like, you know,

209
00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.830
I can't go up and rape women, bunch of hobos up there, you know?

210
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.920
And I remember I walked in and it was this big pit. It was just a big floor.

211
00:11:21.921 --> 00:11:25.670
And it was full of people on cots. People in sleeping bags, people crying,

212
00:11:25.671 --> 00:11:29.510
people, screaming, people like kind of wrestling. It was, it was wild.

213
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:31.190
Babies crying was crazy.

214
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:35.030
And I go up to the third floor and I run to her room and I opened the door,

215
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.880
swing the door open, and it's got two cops on the wall,

216
00:11:37.881 --> 00:11:42.800
jail style stains on the walls, just cracked window. And I was like,

217
00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:47.210
Oh my gosh. She comes in like 10 minutes later, we have crazy hobo sex.

218
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.440
We go at it. Thank God. I had a rubber who knows where she's been. And uh,

219
00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:55.720
the next morning I, this crazy like beer,

220
00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:59.980
I had to get out of me like booze. So I had the big stomach and I was like,

221
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.650
I got a page. Like you can't go to the bat. You'll get caught. And I go, Oh,

222
00:12:02.651 --> 00:12:06.010
I got to go. It's an emergency. So I get the key. I run to the bathroom.

223
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:08.410
I'm peeing. And a girl comes in, I'm in the stall.

224
00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:11.740
A girl comes to the bathroom like, Oh. So I have to sit down and pee, you know?

225
00:12:11.741 --> 00:12:16.570
So she doesn't know, I'm a guy and she just dropping soup cans in there. I mean,

226
00:12:16.571 --> 00:12:17.830
this girl next to me, hobo.

227
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.680
And I just pull my pants up and get the hell out of there.

228
00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:24.640
I give her a key back. I said, thanks. Thanks for nothing. I run home. That's,

229
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:30.100
it was wild. Yeah. That's insane. Yeah. Brave sucks.

230
00:12:30.101 --> 00:12:31.570
It's rarely brave. You know,

231
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.470
talking about how rape is cool is very brave and people go,

232
00:12:35.471 --> 00:12:38.170
how could you say I'm like, I'm not saying it is. I'm saying it's brave.

233
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.200
I'm not saying you'd get ruined. I'm not saying it's a great, it's awesome.

234
00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:41.890
I'm saying.

235
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:44.170
<v 1>It's very brave. Yeah. Yeah. You're dancing on a.</v>

236
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.950
<v 0>Line. Yeah. But we we've ruined that word. And uh, yeah. Comedy,</v>

237
00:12:47.951 --> 00:12:51.280
it turned into some kind of like agreeance off at some point.

238
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.600
And I feel like we're getting out of that.

239
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:57.330
<v 1>Yeah. This, the swing is happening, especially because people, when you tour,</v>

240
00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.650
they tell you how bad they just want to talk and have a good time. Right.

241
00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:04.860
They don't go. Nobody goes to a club for a political lesson. Yes.

242
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:07.320
Nobody goes to like, feel correct about the world.

243
00:13:07.321 --> 00:13:10.830
They go there to escape the that they feel about their workplace every day and

244
00:13:10.831 --> 00:13:14.670
the things that they're not supposed to say and do, and there you go to go,

245
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.580
Oh it. We can just, I can let it burn. And this guy's going to help me,

246
00:13:17.581 --> 00:13:20.880
let it burn the gasoline to be like, let's it now at light it up.

247
00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:21.841
<v 0>Yeah, exactly. I mean,</v>

248
00:13:21.841 --> 00:13:24.720
it's like you go to the Midwest and you talk to some guys on stage talking about

249
00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:27.660
like how we need to help these people. And they're like, dude, I work in a mill.

250
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:33.600
I hit my wife almost a minute ago. Like just please give me a yuck them up.

251
00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.980
<v 1>And you keep making this not funny.</v>

252
00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:36.930
I'm gonna hit her again right in front of you. That's what's going to happen.

253
00:13:36.931 --> 00:13:41.100
I'm on my 15th, bud, bud heavy. So you're to blame. You ought to blame pal.

254
00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:46.290
<v 0>And also I just see jokes as the shell of a puzzle.</v>

255
00:13:46.291 --> 00:13:48.360
I don't see it as like this feeling Z thing.

256
00:13:48.361 --> 00:13:51.780
Like I have a joke in my act where I say, it's gotta be hard to be a kid.

257
00:13:51.781 --> 00:13:56.040
Now we, we were so lucky as kids. Uh, I used to do it in your, your, your,

258
00:13:56.041 --> 00:13:58.770
a tour there. When I'd say, uh, back when we were kids,

259
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.200
you had not care of the world. You run to the car and yell shotgun.

260
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:04.350
Now the only time a kid yells at are now is in a classroom. And people are like,

261
00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:08.510
Oh my God. I'm like, Oh, to me, I just see shotgun, shotgun, that word,

262
00:14:08.511 --> 00:14:12.690
the joke clicks. That's it. I don't see the whole inner webbing of, uh,

263
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.560
people dying and feelings and parents who lost kids. I don't have any of that.

264
00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:17.880
To me. It's just the puzzle.

265
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:23.370
<v 3>I had a joke where I would say where I would say we were at,</v>

266
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.290
we had to go to George's choir concert. And it was like four hours long.

267
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:32.490
And the joke was, I wrote it the night, the night we went to the choir concert,

268
00:14:32.491 --> 00:14:35.490
I then left to do a spot. After the choir concert, I saw,

269
00:14:35.491 --> 00:14:38.700
I just sat through a four hour car concert and everyone was like, Oh,

270
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:40.920
I was like, yeah, where's a school shooter when you need me.

271
00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:44.003
<v 0>That's funny.</v>

272
00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:49.200
<v 3>I mean, I still to this day and it's like, I laugh.</v>

273
00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:52.130
I tried to explain this to someone. One, I go, what.

274
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.350
<v 0>You find funny. I also find funny, but what I find funny,</v>

275
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.480
you won't always find funny things that make me laugh or like really when you're

276
00:14:59.481 --> 00:15:01.820
not supposed to laugh, like, do you remember?

277
00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:06.110
I could not stop showing you guys the Louis CK parent video.

278
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:09.710
Oh man. We were dying. Laughing

279
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:13.220
because he was not trying to be funny.

280
00:15:13.221 --> 00:15:15.350
And that's when people are in their course. Of course. Yeah.

281
00:15:15.351 --> 00:15:18.050
That was comedy gold. It was when he goes in,

282
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:22.630
he goes to this famous comedian was [inaudible].

283
00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.600
I could not stop laughing at that. And I go, I know that this kid lost a child.

284
00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.630
I can't imagine the pain and grief he's gone through.

285
00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:34.400
I can't imagine the anger he had when he saw Louie joking about it. Of course.

286
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:37.400
And that all of that coupled by him,

287
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:40.970
inadvertently being very funny and what is not meant to be fun.

288
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.350
I ju it's like up makes me laugh today. I was just, I just said this today,

289
00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.620
we got a new puppy and I was cuddling with it. And I go,

290
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:53.690
and I was just loving this puppy. I mean, this puppy cuddles so hard.

291
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.860
It, it is almost, I've never seen anything like it. And I go,

292
00:15:57.861 --> 00:16:02.810
someone's had to their dog. Like, that's great. Like I can't,

293
00:16:02.811 --> 00:16:06.960
I can't say that to like my wife's friends get it. They just would be like,

294
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:09.760
what the? That all the time I'll sit there and go.

295
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:14.450
You think pedophiles that little girls make fun of pedophiles and little

296
00:16:14.451 --> 00:16:19.160
boys, like, look at these gay pedos, you know, homo. And I'm like, to me,

297
00:16:19.161 --> 00:16:22.460
I'm like, that's an actually interesting thought to me. You know,

298
00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.090
I'd actually like to have a debate about it, but people go, what the? Holy.

299
00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:28.610
But like, to me, that's something let's, let's let's dig it.

300
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.180
<v 4>Like this broad. What do you think? Dr. Joe? Well,</v>

301
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:38.800
the do the farts pull the out. Thanks. A lot.

302
00:16:38.801 --> 00:16:41.350
Hope to hear for them. Have a great show.

303
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.730
<v 0>Yeah. So, um,</v>

304
00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:49.090
your mom's house listeners and viewers have spent a lot of time. Oh,

305
00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:51.730
is that what? This contemplating? Very weird stuff. Yeah.

306
00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.580
Cogitating on the strange, well, there's no answers for these things, right?

307
00:16:54.581 --> 00:16:55.414
So here's the deal.

308
00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:59.920
So gas forms within the colon because of the bacteria.

309
00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:03.880
It's just forming in there. And it's, if you look at an x-ray of the colon,

310
00:17:03.881 --> 00:17:06.910
it's just all over the place. It's not doing anything.

311
00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:11.020
And your colon is doing this, moving everything through your colon,

312
00:17:11.021 --> 00:17:15.790
pushes everything through dialysis. And when it gets down into the ampulla look,

313
00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:19.590
those extra, those pictures of woe lens and Gammy. The one down there,

314
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:23.140
the second on the bottom, right? The one on the left there,

315
00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:25.450
the one from the lab that you're getting, that's a lot of gas.

316
00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:31.480
That's a lot of gas in there and that'll kill a Jew. Good.

317
00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:37.360
Uh, and, uh, that's off like that one,

318
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:42.880
uh, gas chamber, uh you're on like grassroots,

319
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.540
like we're going to help the downtrodden. Yeah.

320
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:50.490
And so they weren't making money. Like they do some pro bono. And uh,

321
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:54.660
what kind of attorneys were they? They were civil, you know, slipping a Walmart.

322
00:17:54.661 --> 00:17:58.980
Yeah. Bad people. Yeah. Bad. And they hated it. They were both miserable.

323
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.220
They've told me openly, like I hate my job. I feel like every day.

324
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.970
And I was like, ah, but they raised a good kid. Well, we'll see. I mean,

325
00:18:05.971 --> 00:18:10.410
I was a up, you know, juvie and a lot of juvenile hall. Oh yeah.

326
00:18:10.411 --> 00:18:14.010
A couple of times. A lot of, uh, what do you call it? Vandalism. What? Graffiti.

327
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.460
Graffiti. I had a tag name. What was your tag name?

328
00:18:17.461 --> 00:18:20.760
My tag name was stank. S T a N K. Yeah.

329
00:18:20.761 --> 00:18:23.580
Which is still embarrassed about should be that's it? That is embarrassing.

330
00:18:23.581 --> 00:18:26.580
Yeah. It was all of my notebooks and we would break stuff.

331
00:18:26.581 --> 00:18:27.181
We would do this thing.

332
00:18:27.181 --> 00:18:30.960
We would drive down the street and knock off side view mirrors. Oh yeah.

333
00:18:30.961 --> 00:18:34.710
I love that. That was fun. That was like a pastime mailboxes. No,

334
00:18:34.711 --> 00:18:38.760
not really mailbox. It was more side view houses. We egged houses.

335
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.350
We teepeed, we, uh, we ran a muck. You did it all. Oh yes.

336
00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:45.180
Isn't egging houses. I realized this the other day.

337
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:49.530
It's like the most white privilege thing to throw good food at a home. Oh yeah.

338
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:52.050
You're throwing food at property. It's like just such a privileged person.

339
00:18:52.051 --> 00:18:55.320
Ruining a privileged person's afternoon. Good plan kind of abortion. Yeah.

340
00:18:55.321 --> 00:18:57.060
You're really thinking about it. Well, that's, I'm pro choice.

341
00:18:57.061 --> 00:19:00.660
So that's why I'm pro choice. Same here. You should,

342
00:19:00.661 --> 00:19:03.150
you should be embarrassed about stuff like that because we all have that.

343
00:19:03.151 --> 00:19:06.270
Like I thought I could rap when I was, Oh,

344
00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:10.530
that's I never got into that stuff because I grew up in a black neighborhood.

345
00:19:10.531 --> 00:19:12.720
So I had enough blackness inside my.

346
00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:18.240
Like you had to kind of seek it out and rebel. Maybe. No, no, I loved it.

347
00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.340
I loved it so much. Wow.

348
00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.600
<v 3>Just out of curiosity, did we party together in Seattle? Yeah.</v>

349
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:27.290
<v 0>Yes. I might know that it was Portland actually. Yeah. We went to a strip club.</v>

350
00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.940
God, that was a great night. And you, I was so hung over. I'm a Rogers was like,

351
00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.220

354
00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.300
but I kept drinking. And then I saw you at the airport at 6:00 AM.

355
00:19:44.301 --> 00:19:47.540
And you had appeared your hand still drinking. Yeah. I was very impressed.

356
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:52.070
<v 3>Yeah. That's a, yeah. Well that that's my Mo I, I can't, I,</v>

357
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:53.930
I can reward myself. I get up early.

358
00:19:53.931 --> 00:19:58.640
Like I got off stage at like one yet. Yes. Two days ago,

359
00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:03.500
Saturday night or Sunday morning, my car picked me up at four and I said,

360
00:20:03.501 --> 00:20:07.770
okay, if I can get like two hours sleep, then I'll go.

361
00:20:07.771 --> 00:20:10.460
I'll get myself a cocktail. And then, and then, and I was like,

362
00:20:10.461 --> 00:20:13.160
and then that'll right. The boat immediately share a little bit of buzz.

363
00:20:13.161 --> 00:20:15.080
I'm like, Oh, I'm fine. And so.

364
00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.080
<v 0>Have you tried motive pure? Have you heard of this? Oh,</v>

365
00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:21.830
I did drunk history and I was talking to the guy who ran, I forget his name,

366
00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.190
but, uh, Derek, Derek waters. And he was like, I was like, look,

367
00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.690
I can't wait to do the show, but I like got to let you know,

368
00:20:26.691 --> 00:20:29.720
I get the worst hangovers. Like two-day hangovers, they're brutal.

369
00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.250
And he's like, Oh, I got a thing.

370
00:20:31.251 --> 00:20:34.580
It's called motive pure it's they give it to athletes to stay hydrated.

371
00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.000
He's like, I haven't had a hangover in four years. I'm like, Oh my God.

372
00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:42.440
He's like, get them on Amazon go nuts. So I ordered a bunch. I do drunk history.

373
00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:46.340
I drank like a third of a bottle of scotch. I really go after it.

374
00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:50.490
And a bottle of scotch. Is that a lot? I don't know. I drank it.

375
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.970
It was like a gold label,

376
00:20:51.971 --> 00:20:55.180
but I drank a lot of it more than half and I really went hard.

377
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:58.150
Cause I wanted to be funny for the show. And he's like, here's your motive?

378
00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.890
Pure. And it's like a little shot. I drank it. That's it? Yeah.

379
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:06.850
Buying a box right now. I drank it. Can get it by tomorrow. There you go.

380
00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:11.560
So that'll be good for your hangover tomorrow, but I put it down and I wake up.

381
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:15.550
I've never been more hung over at puke. My brains out. I was blood. I was,

382
00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:18.850
I was, uh, I had a gig that night. I had to cancel the gig.

383
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.120
I couldn't get out of bed. I was like regarding Henry. I was in bed.

384
00:21:22.121 --> 00:21:26.560
I couldn't move my toes. I couldn't get out of bed. It was brutal. Oh my God.

385
00:21:26.561 --> 00:21:29.830
That, that, that. I think you got to like drink a lot of it or something,

386
00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:33.680
but I overrode it with the scotch, but try,

387
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:37.510
it might like it didn't work for me. Do you still party? Oh yeah.

388
00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:42.340
I had a crazy weekend in Columbus. Great city. Funny bone.

389
00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:43.363

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:53.490
They call it the Austin of the Midwest. Yeah. Yeah. Which I dunno.

393
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.250
Seems a little weird, but uh, good times. Great.

397
00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:09.810
that I think every comic notices, their sound system is amazing.

398
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:15.030
It's the best sound you've ever had. Great. It's like you hear yourself,

399
00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:18.330
but it's not overwhelming. Yeah. I, I love those,

400
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:22.260
those two clubs because you can pack them out and you can make like legit money.

401
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:22.380
Yeah.

402
00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:25.080
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. And I hate doing the meet and greet after,</v>

403
00:22:25.081 --> 00:22:28.320
but I just suck it up and I do it. And you get a couple of numbers and yeah,

404
00:22:28.321 --> 00:22:31.350
it's a, it's a cakewalk out there in the Midwest. You leave this weekend.

405
00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:36.060
Oh boy. Oh boy. Did I? I mean, it's,

406
00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.110
you know, some curly haired, new Yorker shows up and you look,

407
00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:44.730
you look exotic out there. It's a good time. It's fun.

408
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:49.110
<v 3>So yeah. That's what, uh, what soda was like. Yeah.</v>

409
00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.700
Mark's numbers are through the roof.

410
00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.890
<v 0>Well, I went hard, man. You know, I was,</v>

411
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:54.720
I never got laid in high school and all that.

412
00:22:54.721 --> 00:22:58.410
So I just put my focus into that and getting laid. It's a real art form.

413
00:22:58.411 --> 00:23:01.770
It's a beautiful thing. Yeah. Yeah. So I just got good at it.

414
00:23:01.771 --> 00:23:02.640
It was like open mics.

415
00:23:02.641 --> 00:23:05.790
I would got shut down for months and months then got better and better.

416
00:23:05.791 --> 00:23:06.720
And then you get on Twitter.

417
00:23:06.721 --> 00:23:09.540
I mean a Tinder and Bumble and that's a game changer,

418
00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:14.640
a hundred percent true story. Dan. That's a funny guy. He with him. Pretty good.

419
00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:19.470
His name was Lil Duvall. Um,

420
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.380
mine is, uh, just say pancakes. All right.

421
00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:26.640
I got lost in upstate New York and I couldn't figure out I didn't have a

422
00:23:26.641 --> 00:23:27.870
smartphone. I didn't know where I was going.

423
00:23:27.871 --> 00:23:30.180
So I see this black girl in the car and she was really pretty.

424
00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.790
And I go up to her and I talked to her. I'm like, Hey, can you help me out?

425
00:23:32.791 --> 00:23:35.580
And we kind of flirting a little bit. Like we're like hitting it off.

426
00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.160
And she's laughing. I'm zigging and zagging.

427
00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:42.150
And this guy drives by in a truck like a hillbilly guy and yells out pancake

428
00:23:42.151 --> 00:23:45.600
lover. And uh, I was like, Jesus, man. Yeah.

429
00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:48.420
I just met this girl and you're gonna use the L word already

430
00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:53.340
slow down. You know, that's an important word. We should bury that word, blah,

431
00:23:53.341 --> 00:23:57.030
blah, blah. Oh yeah. Maybe I could bring it back. I don't know.
