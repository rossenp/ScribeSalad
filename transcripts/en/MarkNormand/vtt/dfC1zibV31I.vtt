00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.330
We're going to take a spin around the museum with our curator, Jennifer.

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.200
Yeah, she's good. Very lovely. That's the kind of guy you got a fist bump.

4
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.040
<v 1>So welcome to the Fordham museum. Greek Etruscan and Roman art. I trust now.</v>

5
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.810
<v 0>So that's when you ride horses, right? Yes. Trust,</v>

6
00:00:23.811 --> 00:00:27.080

7
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.560
That's a question. Ah, no question me.

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.670
<v 1>Let me start over in the corner.</v>

9
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.863
<v 0>Here.</v>

10
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.860
This is the Harpo Marx trophy. I was thinking Susan Boyle, but yeah,

11
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.990
both work. Yeah. Maybe one, one of the nose is bleeding. Susan boy.

12
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.070
It was a Coke habit. Yeah.

13
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.810
<v 1>That's actually Medusa. She was supposedly so ugly that when men looked at her,</v>

14
00:00:56.811 --> 00:00:58.040
they turned to stone.

15
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.760
<v 0>Oh, well wouldn't it be a good thing? Yeah. No.</v>

16
00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:03.320
What are they keeping these usually.

17
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.770
<v 1>Usually these are, these were just basically funerary.</v>

18
00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:11.570
So nothing was kept in these. Yeah. These ones were directly to the tune.

19
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.110
<v 0>Oh, I'm at my grandfather's funeral. We were all drinking pretty heavily.</v>

20
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.050
Are you Irish? Yeah.

21
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.560
I turned to stone. It's pretty small.

22
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.130
<v 1>Actually. Maybe did contain something. Um, grain, grain of some sort.</v>

23
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.030
These were probably likely, um, or at least one of their potential uses.

24
00:01:32.031 --> 00:01:34.250
Whereas whereas kitchen storage vessels.

25
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.820
<v 0>They just hit us with the number. We came all this way. 300, 400 bucks.</v>

26
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.270
You want to buy one of these things? Yeah. I want to get this a swap meet.

27
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.360
I got that. I got one 80 on me. So look great.

28
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.430
<v 1>And what do you guys share an apartment.</v>

29
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.943
<v 0>Timeshare?</v>

30
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.120
<v 1>What we have in this case are two examples of sinner. Well,</v>

31
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.070
a sinner I earned here and an ossuary ashes. Bones. Oh,

32
00:02:04.071 --> 00:02:06.290
Whoa. Conceptually really cool. Isn't it?

33
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.650
<v 0>Ashes and bones. A great morning team. Yeah.</v>

34
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:14.600
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

35
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.530
<v 0>She's in bones.</v>

36
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.620
<v 1>What do you make of this little guy on top and the front of him?</v>

37
00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:23.780
What do you think of him? What do you think he is?

38
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.350
<v 0>Oh yeah. He looks like a Pee-wee's play.</v>

39
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.530
<v 1>Play house. What about you? What do you think he is in a weather?</v>

40
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.400
<v 0>Is this a Villanovan geometric impasto circuit. Ninth century. By any chance?</v>

41
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.700
That's extraordinary. I know quite a bit.

42
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.720
<v 1>He's either an ancestor figure,</v>

43
00:02:44.721 --> 00:02:48.800
which is sort of like the guardian of the house or he is an aperture paying

44
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.530
finger. Do you know what that means? Do you know what that means?

45
00:02:51.531 --> 00:02:54.110
You know what that means? Active.

46
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.820
<v 0>Do you know what it means for tech? Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.070
It's a Dominican. Yeah. I think it's acrobatic.

48
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.620
<v 1>All of these things. You were, you're all drawing the right connection. No,</v>

49
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.480
it actually means to ward off evil.

50
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.040
<v 0>Uh, it's big. The police are applicant Dre. Wow.</v>

51
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.250
It's like, this is beautiful. I like it in a detail.

52
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.310
What do you think of that detail? It's nice. I got some letters there.

53
00:03:26.311 --> 00:03:29.610
Maximus shorter. I think they could have better details. Like,

54
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.170
like a flame shooting out the side, like a Corvette. Yes.

55
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.000
That kind of detail. Yeah. Yeah. What goes in here? Is this a moving?

56
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.750
I've still got a decal decal. It's not a detail.

57
00:03:42.751 --> 00:03:46.680
A decal decals where I get my drugs decal on 38th

58
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.990
sarcophagus. It means coffin. So can I go to a funeral and go, Hey, a couple.

59
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.100
The good looking sarky yeah.

60
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.850
<v 1>You could. You could do that. Sarcophagus actually means flesh eating.</v>

61
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.320
<v 0>Whoa.</v>

62
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.070
<v 1>Well in a metaphorical type bag.</v>

63
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.880
<v 0>There, I got a bunny in here. Good bit off</v>

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:17.730
whole Mesopotamia.

66
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.670
<v 1>This inscription. Thank you very much. I'm having a hard time today.</v>

67
00:04:23.671 --> 00:04:27.210
You really are by leaps and bounds. Uh,

68
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.130
this inscription tells us,

69
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.440
we hear that he was the father who had the same name as the child.

70
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.970
Livia is probably Maximus was member of the 12th urban cohort,

71
00:04:38.971 --> 00:04:42.810
which is essentially a police precinct. There's a black kid. One of the,

72
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.030
no, he wasn't killed by the police. He was,

73
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.100
he was a member of the police force.

74
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.370
<v 0>Uh, Irish. Got it. It's a good place to come back to call this an antique</v>

75
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.540
antiques, like a lamp. This is a artifact.

76
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.360
Okay. Antigua. No Aruba. Jamaica. Ooh.

77
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.750
I'd take it to Bermuda.

78
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.070
[inaudible] [inaudible] crustaceans American pickers over this.

79
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.290

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.930

81
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.230
pick up toys. Antiques. We drove here and I didn't want to say it.

82
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.290
I do love antiques. These are little marijuana pieces.

83
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.100
<v 1>Lamps, duck, coals. They are lamps.</v>

84
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.180

<v 1>Had to say it.</v>

89
00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.910
<v 0>Yeah. Even those guys are outraged.</v>

90
00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.610
I got swords down here. Swords. How did I miss the swords spearheads?

91
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.233
Spearpoints sweat.

92
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.650
<v 1>Really? Isn't my material. I'm just my bag.</v>

93
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.160
<v 0>Wow. These are great. Oh, look at this tiny little thing.</v>

94
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:40.683
I have heard that before.

95
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:43.773

97
00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:02.140
<v 0>Oh, we love gear. So we met this. This is what we're looking at now.</v>

98
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.570
Uh, yes it is. Yeah. This is excellent observation. We are looking at it.

99
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:12.370
You know what we're looking? Yeah. What do you make of it? What is it?

100
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.110
This is a motive head of a young man.

101
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.350
I feel is votive to me. It's that kid.

102
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.220
<v 1>A vote of youth of a capita of the lotto,</v>

103
00:07:24.221 --> 00:07:27.100
which is the type of the type of vote of it.

104
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.010
<v 0>It feels like a Starbucks beverage. Kevin is a lotto</v>

105
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.130
is a votive speaking of flat and wide question, a real question.

106
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.050
I've already lost interest in

107
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.650
something you offer in a sanctuary is your religious practice.

108
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:48.200
Got it.

109
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.700
<v 1>You offer something to the gods and hopefully you get something back,</v>

110
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.640
a little quid pro quo. So to speak.

111
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.520
It sounds a little lambs like silence.

112
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.350
<v 0>Yes. The Oscars. Yes. Picture director, actor, actress,</v>

113
00:08:04.351 --> 00:08:05.184
screenplay.

114
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:10.240
<v 1>The person who published these in our catalog suggested that perhaps they were</v>

115
00:08:10.241 --> 00:08:14.380
part of a, uh, a sarcophagus relief decoration to was on top of it.

116
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.440
<v 0>Coffin. Yes. But we don't know.</v>

117
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.810
They need to coffin coffin. Take your head and coffin.

118
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.350
<v 1>Yeah. I've heard of that.</v>

119
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:28.743
<v 0>Yeah. Check it out.</v>

120
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.273
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

121
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.540
<v 0>This thing is really unbelievable here. This big giant.</v>

122
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:40.690
Oh, it's a penis I think.

123
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.040
<v 1>But anatomically.</v>

124
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:49.840
<v 0>It looks like an arm. Yeah, kinda. Yeah.</v>

125
00:08:49.841 --> 00:08:51.100
It's a little, uh, fishy.

126
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.143
<v 1>Animals.</v>

127
00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.540
<v 0>That can be a little bit situation too.</v>

128
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.230
Oh, sorry. The Mollen kicked in.

129
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.280
I can tell that hurts so much.

130
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.550
Oh God.

131
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.400
<v 1>Uh, yes. Ram headed drinking cup here.</v>

132
00:09:19.401 --> 00:09:23.900
I want you to put your grill right up to there. Yeah. Yeah. That's the one.

133
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.660
And I want you to see that now.

134
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:30.500
That's what you would see once he finished drinking his wine,

135
00:09:30.501 --> 00:09:33.140
he would turn into a goat head.

136
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:39.440
<v 0>Oh yeah. So even back then they had.</v>

137
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.273
<v 1>Drinking games.</v>

138
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:45.110
<v 0>No. Was campus rape a problem back then because it seems to be quite an epidemic</v>

139
00:09:45.111 --> 00:09:48.260
right now. I think it was just rape. Ah, no campus. Yeah.

140
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:52.040
That they've raped everywhere. Drinking games are fun.

141
00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.030
I didn't know that the Romans admit of it being more of a Greek thing.

142
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:03.740
[inaudible] yes. Hey, they invented it.

143
00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:05.391
Well,

144
00:10:05.391 --> 00:10:09.530
I've been Joe list and I'm Mark norm and we are a lot smarter than we were at

145
00:10:09.531 --> 00:10:13.580
the beginning of the day. You got that right? I was a real idiot. Sure.

146
00:10:13.581 --> 00:10:16.670
Where I didn't want to tell you that one stung.
