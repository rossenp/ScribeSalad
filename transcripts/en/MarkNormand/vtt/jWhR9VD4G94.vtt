14
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.090
you had a tenant and you just said that he doesn't, he doesn't watch porn.

15
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.770
You seem a little pent up. I never watched porn. Wow.

16
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.700
And I haven't watched porn in men. You'll hurt, man.

17
00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:10.520
I do it every day and it's gotta be black. Yeah. But I don't know.

18
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.650
How do you, how do you do it? You, what are your imagination?

19
00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:16.280
Like eighth grade style? Uh, I I'm older. I just, I don't know.

20
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.740
I don't think back to, I don't even turn off,

21
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.520
back off in black and white anymore. Really? I swear to God.

22
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.190
I'm just like, dude, get the out. You're sitting. You're weird.

23
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.850
I met him. He's better than alpha. He wins.

24
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.840
<v 0>He wins. Yeah. We're in New York. It's it feels more like, Oh,</v>

25
00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:41.720
that was a clever take on that joke. And it was,

26
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.130
it feels more already a little bit like a little more intellectually, like,

27
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.090
like David tells, I mentioned he looks like a hobo, but he's just brilliant guy.

28
00:01:50.091 --> 00:01:50.840
You know?

29
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.980
<v 2>He's a Le yeah. Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.550
You always have somebody like that in building that makes you check.

31
00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:57.980
That checks the, all the levels. It's like,

32
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.560
even if he's not personally doing it, it's just him being there.

33
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.830
There's a ceiling as to what's going on. Yeah. But then you go to the.

34
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.030
<v 0>I'm in the main room green room and you're like, look, all these sexy dudes,</v>

35
00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:11.210
you know, like Brennan shoves, a chiseled fat.

36
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.110
Like he's got the slick hair, the coolest shoes got a chain on. And like,

37
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.670
I would never even think to put on a chain.

38
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.660
<v 2>The white part of bacon. Yeah. On the white part of bacon. Still good. But boy.</v>

39
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.010
Yeah. Yeah. Thick and not good for it. Yeah. He's a thick crust.

40
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.410
It's got the cheese in there too.

41
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.380
<v 0>You know, you stretch it and it pulls.</v>

42
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.260
<v 2>But I was like, dang. I was Jesus.</v>

43
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.910
<v 0>I know. I know. But he's like seven foot one. He's got a huge piece of bad.</v>

44
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.860
That's crazy. One leg dude is.

45
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.110
<v 2>That is a, it's a penis with a neon. Wow. He's going to bend the Dick. Yeah,</v>

46
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.810

47
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.080
<v 0>It's a kickstand, a Dick Stan. Uh, all, all the Europe ones, you know,</v>

48
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.780

49
00:02:56.781 --> 00:02:59.980
we just did the canals and get a, got a bunch of a drunk guy.

50
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.280
<v 1>Nah, not a weed guy. I can't do it. I'm too up.</v>

51
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.320
The weed brings out all the demons.

52
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.250
It doesn't suppress them like alcohol what'd you mean you like booze and uppers?

53
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.870
Yeah. Yeah. You don't seem like a lost, you have your darkness.

54
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:17.230
It's from your childhood. I think so. Yeah. I had a weird childhood. How so?

55
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.490
Well, let's see, uh, my dad got a wild hair up his and bought a mansion,

56
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.520
dilapidated mansion in a poor black neighborhood. So first of all,

57
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:27.040
the house was. We barely had running water. It was, you know,

58
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:30.130
we'd have family meetings. All right, go at school. Don't here.

59
00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:33.340
We need the water. And then my dad started running out of money.

60
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:37.360
So he made the back half a bed and breakfast, like old style.

61
00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:40.780
But so my mom's whipping up pancakes at 8:00 AM and I'm like, can I get one?

62
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.490
She's like blow big Dick, eat a bowl of Cheerios, your gut. And so I was like,

63
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:47.650
all right, sorry. Jesus. And so,

64
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.250
you know there's so my parents were workaholics. They're checked out. You know,

65
00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:53.860
they, they, they were nice people, but they're just like, Hey,

66
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:57.460
we gave birth to you. You figured it out. Yeah. Go watch TV.

67
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.200
There's no attention. Yes. Dr. Drew. I just didn't maybe,

68
00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:06.220
but boy, it said give him the attention. So with Dr. Juicy, so he said you're,

69
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.010
uh, cause I was like, my mom didn't react. Like I have girlfriends.

70
00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:11.500
I'll introduce it to my mom. They're like, whew. That was tough.

71
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:13.810
I felt like I was bombing in there. I'm like welcome to my life. You.

72
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.610
Jesus Christ. I'm 20 years of that and growing up and uh,

73
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.740
so no wonder you need blasts from straight exam. Like ask me a question,

74
00:04:23.741 --> 00:04:24.610
just ask me a random question.

75
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.010
<v 3>Um, my mom, um, a random question. Um, where are you from?</v>

76
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.930
<v 1>What time is it? Where are we going to get up? It's just like, Oh, sorry.</v>

77
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.540
I'm engaged. Yeah. And it's she stopped me and she's just like,

78
00:04:39.541 --> 00:04:42.010
she's just got her shut down. She just like thinking about,

79
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.430
I got to pay the bill, I got to water the plants, you know? And you're like,

80
00:04:44.431 --> 00:04:47.430
you have brothers and sisters, older brother. And he's a genius. He's like this,

81
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.860
you know, math, computer wizard.

82
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.370
And our neighborhood was so dangerous that he just had into a computer,

83
00:04:53.371 --> 00:04:54.151
like as a kid.

84
00:04:54.151 --> 00:04:58.080
And he just became like DAS and make friends in the neighborhood with the black.

85
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.990
Yeah. Yeah. But then you got into fights and there was a lot of racial tension.

86
00:05:00.991 --> 00:05:04.620
It was the nineties and bikes were stolen and we got robbed all the time.

87
00:05:04.621 --> 00:05:08.400
We had this crazy alarm going off because our house was so big and you would

88
00:05:08.401 --> 00:05:08.581
just,

89
00:05:08.581 --> 00:05:11.820
I'd be like an eight year old kid and you'd just hear like glass breaking and

90
00:05:11.821 --> 00:05:12.654
then.

91
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.560
<v 3>Woo. And I'm just like, ah.</v>

92
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.100
<v 1>I'm in my room. Like hugging up Teddy, you know,</v>

93
00:05:17.101 --> 00:05:20.940
hoping I don't get raped by a Leroy. And uh, you know,

94
00:05:20.941 --> 00:05:24.030
you go downstairs and Hey, the TV's gone today. You know? And that was,

95
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.530
that was a Tuesday. And we got robbed all the time. My dad he's got like,

96
00:05:28.531 --> 00:05:31.620
he's like, N-word rich. You know where he's like, Oh, we're gonna buy a Lexus,

97
00:05:31.621 --> 00:05:34.770
but it's Alexis, you know? So the Lexus would get stolen and he's like,

98
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.550
all right, he'll, he'll give me like cab money to go to school and. And uh,

99
00:05:38.551 --> 00:05:41.400
and that was just how it was. I remember I told this story on Rogan,

100
00:05:41.401 --> 00:05:44.610
but I got my bike stolen. Just, just street Tufts, you know,

101
00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:47.820
they would rub their front tire on your back tire. And that meant like a, your.

102
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.100
And they would just take your bike.

103
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.670
<v 4>Forever. I didn't get a good night's sleep, but that did end up working.</v>

104
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.310
Oh really? It worked for both of them. Yeah. It didn't work for me.

105
00:05:56.311 --> 00:05:58.130
I tried these pills.

106
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.380
<v 0>Like to dry you out. That didn't work. And then my dad,</v>

107
00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:03.710
eventually we got so fed up because he was annoyed with the bedwetting.

108
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:05.600
He's like, you gotta grow up. You lose her.

109
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.240
So he said no more liquids after six.

110
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:13.220
So I'm sitting there eating Doritos at six Oh eight going like, you know,

111
00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:16.250
I look like a, like a Somali pirate. I'm so thirsty. I'm like,

112
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.400
it's like Waterworld. I gotta pee in a jar and filter it. You know,

113
00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:23.780
I'm so thirsty. And I'm, you know, my brothers gun, judge guzzling,

114
00:06:23.781 --> 00:06:27.240
a Kool-Aid and and Pepsi. And I'm like, God,

115
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.710
he's not having that problem at all. No, it was brutal, man.

116
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.230
It was a dry County. And so you would,

117
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.570
would you not go to sleep overs because of it?

118
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.420
I would go cause I wanted to hang and I wanted to, you know,

119
00:06:38.421 --> 00:06:42.290
be a part of society. I didn't want to be like a weirdo, like disabled guy.

120
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:46.900
Like I can't go, I have a problem. So I would just stay up all night. And like,

121
00:06:46.901 --> 00:06:49.820
it was like, I was like in a Holocaust death camp, I was like, all right, I'll,

122
00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:51.290
I'll sleep in shifts. You know,

123
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.890
split for like 10 minutes here and then I'll wake up and I saw everything.

124
00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:58.100
I would just walk around my friend's houses at like two in the morning.

125
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.850
They're there snoozing. And I'd go through the mom's panties and you know,

126
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.520
watch some TV and check the fridge.

127
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.290
I was like a weird middle Nightcrawler guy at like nine, you know,

128
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.810
checking out porn, you know,

129
00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:13.790
I'm going in and out of the house playing with a cat,

130
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:18.710
whatever I had to do jerk off on a friend's face. Anything just kill the time.

131
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.020
Did you guys jerk off together? You and your buds? No, never. Oh,

132
00:07:24.021 --> 00:07:28.550
that was a big one and none of the w okay, so let's talk about that too,

133
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.270
because was it a circle jerk thing or what was it? You were like, nah,

134
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:40.430
you take a corner, I'll take a corner. We got the porn in the middle and uh,

135
00:07:40.431 --> 00:07:42.080
yeah, it was like a bonding experience.

136
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.800
I did make my friend taste it once and he never talked to me again.

137
00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.280
[inaudible] I was like, I dare you to taste. He's like, I'm not tasting.

138
00:07:52.281 --> 00:07:56.150
I was like a double dog. And he was like, Hey Jay, you know,

139
00:07:56.151 --> 00:08:00.860
it was a great moment. I mean, we're still cool.

140
00:08:00.861 --> 00:08:04.040
He's he's dead. Now. He was a gay porn star.

141
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.980
<v 2>When I was growing up, they had a thing for gyp and for a while, girls, uh,</v>

142
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.210

<v 0>I don't mind a trip, but I don't want it through my Dick hole.</v>

147
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.100

<v 0>Well, you came out good.</v>

152
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.330
<v 2>That's what I'm saying, man.</v>

153
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.360
Why a lot of these guys go on 36 and Nick got out early, bro.

154
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.223
Nick is a hard worker.

155
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.850
<v 0>Oh yeah. That was like a C-section really? Oh yeah. I came up through the roof.</v>

156
00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:53.390
<v 2>Oh, wow.</v>

157
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.520
I guess maybe there's the moon roof or something that I didn't come up through

158
00:08:56.521 --> 00:08:59.370
the door. I could see you being like, I don't know. You know,

159
00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.080
is this the best thoroughfare? Right.

160
00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.980
<v 0>I see what else is going on. And you've all touched your mom's badge.</v>

161
00:09:03.981 --> 00:09:07.970
I haven't touched, well, maybe you've touched my mom's. She's a big, but uh,

162
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.100
I haven't touched my mom's vagina, which feels pretty good.

163
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:14.270
<v 2>Oh yeah. Oh, I guess I could see that. Yeah. There is always a weird element.</v>

164
00:09:14.271 --> 00:09:17.540
I think sometimes when I look at my mom and she, and I both know it, I did.

165
00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:18.710
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

166
00:09:18.711 --> 00:09:22.790
You ruined her labia for a while and they say it goes back.

167
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.120
<v 2>Yeah, I hear it's never exactly the same, but that's my buddy said that.</v>

168
00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:31.220
<v 0>Ooh, well maybe at a big kid or something. Yeah. He said though,</v>

169
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.280
cause I've, we've all banged some milks and it didn't feel that different.

170
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:39.680
<v 2>Yeah. I don't have any feelings in my penis at all. I don't feel like come on.</v>

171
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.980
I don't think so. I mean, it all, so many of the nerves were in my brain,

172
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.070
so it's like, if I think hard enough, I can feel something,

173
00:09:46.071 --> 00:09:50.300
but otherwise it's kind of like a wait, are you serious? Yeah. I'm just not,

174
00:09:50.301 --> 00:09:51.134
I mean, yeah, like.

175
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.050
<v 0>Very sensitive downtown. I don't think so. I don't know.</v>

176
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:58.880
You're not just all over. Not really. Oh, I put it in. I'm done.

177
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.120
Oh man. Yeah. I mean, and don't worry. I got the brain stuff too.

178
00:10:02.121 --> 00:10:06.980
I'm going and I hate myself. I'm tiny. I'm gay all this, but I don't have the,

179
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:11.210
uh, you got the band back together. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. My like a,

180
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:15.770
like a girl at seeing the notebook. It's just weeping. It's bad.

181
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.670
<v 2>Bro. The first time I ever had sex, I remember getting right up.</v>

182
00:10:19.671 --> 00:10:24.320
Like literally my penis was right outside of this girl's um,

183
00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:29.360
vagina. And it just like sneezed, you know?

184
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:31.700
Just like, like it was so nervous.

185
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:35.590
<v 0>So it hit the out. So it, it pressure wall.</v>

186
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.680
<v 2>Oh definitely. And it was like a, it was almost like my penis was like, Oh,</v>

187
00:10:38.681 --> 00:10:43.130
I'm too sick to handle this, this vomited outside of this girl's entryway.

188
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:43.880
You know.

189
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:48.110
<v 0>The table, you didn't even get to the buffet. Oh man.</v>

190
00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.130
You golden corral.

191
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.320
<v 2>Ready? Everybody was so ready. So then out were 10. Like I was so ready bro.</v>

192
00:10:54.321 --> 00:10:57.350
And that was crazy. Cause I had to like, Oh, hold on.

193
00:10:57.351 --> 00:10:59.540
I don't want to just do this. I don't want to make up this long.

194
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.700
<v 0>Right. Um, all right, please, please tear. I,</v>

195
00:11:04.701 --> 00:11:06.980
I do want to talk to you about dating though.

196
00:11:06.981 --> 00:11:11.750
So please all these problems going on the bed wedding, the, this, the, that,

197
00:11:11.751 --> 00:11:15.320
what age do you start getting into girls and actually dating.

198
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:17.660
And how old are you when you lose your virginity?

199
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:22.070
I was such a mess like anxiety wise insecurity wise that I couldn't

200
00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:23.830
pick up a lady.

201
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.470
I had to be boozing and she had to be boozing and I w I had no game or anything,

202
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.170
but I eventually met a gal and uh,

203
00:11:30.171 --> 00:11:34.610
we became like serious and it was like my only girlfriend and we dated from high

204
00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:39.020
school till out of college. Wow. High school sweetheart. We did it for 12 years,

205
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:43.730
but uh, I peed on her many a time. Do you still, are you still talking to her?

206
00:11:43.731 --> 00:11:48.680
She's married now, but we're cool. I kind of her over a few times, but uh,

207
00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:52.550
yeah, we're cool. And she was great. I mean she,

208
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:57.410
did you both take each other's virginity? No. No. Well,

209
00:11:57.411 --> 00:11:59.670
we met as virgins and then, Oh,

210
00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:03.780
I a prostitute and she found some other guy I think, out of anger.

211
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:05.820
And then we got back together.

212
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:09.630
So you lost your virginity to a processor or she didn't charge me.

213
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:15.030
Yeah. It worked out. I had a coupon.

214
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:20.130
What did you, why did you decide to do it like that when you had a girlfriend?

215
00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.850
Well, it was, we were kinda on the rocks. So we were talking,

216
00:12:23.851 --> 00:12:26.520
remember when people were talking, but I don't know.

217
00:12:26.521 --> 00:12:29.220
We weren't really official started yet.

218
00:12:29.221 --> 00:12:32.070
It wasn't like you had been going for a year and hadn't had sex.

219
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.680
We're we're on the phone every now and then.

220
00:12:34.681 --> 00:12:38.370
And we'd go to prom or something to sock hop together, but it,

221
00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:43.140
it wasn't too serious. And then it was two K was in the air.

222
00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:46.350
You remember that? Yeah. When the world was going to happen and it was a,

223
00:12:46.351 --> 00:12:49.320
it was a buzz and it was two, it was 1999.

224
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.560
And me and my friends went to the French quarter, was new year's Eve, Eve.

225
00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:57.570
And uh, the best, the best Eve is way better than new year's day.

226
00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.990
It is. There's no pressure. No, one's trying to look good.

227
00:13:00.991 --> 00:13:04.020
Hurry up and get somewhere. Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. The new year's Eve,

228
00:13:04.021 --> 00:13:06.570
Eve is the jam, the jam. And you know,

229
00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.570
we had this big party to go to on new year's Eve. So new year's Eve, we're like,

230
00:13:09.571 --> 00:13:13.440
Hey, let's do the quarter. We're right here. Let's do it. So, uh,

231
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.000
I w I'm out with friends,

232
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:19.650
I see a woman on the balcony and she's just flashing at the Ramada hotel on

233
00:13:19.651 --> 00:13:22.380
bourbon. I'll never forget it. And she was an older, uh, you know,

234
00:13:22.381 --> 00:13:27.210
she she'd seen some winters say that she was a little,

235
00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:30.990
you know, a wear and tear. You could tell she,

236
00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:34.020
she looked like Jennifer Aniston after a good fistfight,

237
00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:39.180
but she had a leather jacket with no shirt. And she just kept flashing people,

238
00:13:39.181 --> 00:13:43.500
which is pretty commonplace in the big, easy, yeah, I was say that's. Yeah.

239
00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:48.180
And it's new year's so there's a buzz in the air and I'm 16 and we're all

240
00:13:48.181 --> 00:13:52.740
drinking and. And uh, so we're just staring at her. This is pre Brazzers.

241
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.633
So we're just like,

242
00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:01.380
[inaudible] this is pre girls gone wild too. Isn't it?

243
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:06.720
Maybe like right there. They're right in there. So were big. Yeah. And, uh,

244
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:10.260
she she's a staring and she she's like yelling at us,

245
00:14:10.261 --> 00:14:12.810
like what what's going on with you guys? You know, we're like, Hey,

246
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:17.250
we'd like to come up. We're around. And she's like, I'll come down.

247
00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:19.860
So she comes down and uh,

248
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:24.390
she's talking to us and right then it's like, Oh, this is game on. Like,

249
00:14:24.391 --> 00:14:27.540
this woman is down for something. And, but we're so nervous.

250
00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:31.470
Cause you're still talking to an adult lady who's, you know, 78. And she's like,

251
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:34.620
uh, you kids want to come up and throw some beads. And I immediately was like,

252
00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.500
Oh, she thinks we're kids. This isn't going to work.

253
00:14:37.501 --> 00:14:39.990
So I just do a hail Mary and I go, Hey, you want to,

254
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:43.200
I don't want to go on a 2000 a Virgin. And she goes, well, I won't let ya.

255
00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:47.850
And that was it. How old was she? She's probably 50 something. 53.

256
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.700
And so then what happens? So I,

257
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.440
she brings me in two guys up my other two friends went and got drinks or

258
00:14:54.441 --> 00:14:58.550
something. And uh, I remember she opens the door to her hotel room,

259
00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:59.690
the door swings open.

260
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:03.650
There's an old man with a white beard and a Harley Davidson hat and a leather

261
00:15:03.651 --> 00:15:06.980
jacket, just sitting, staring at the door. And I was like, Oh,

262
00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:11.840
we're we're going to die. This guy, Beverly has a gun. That's loaded. Exactly.

263
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:16.700
He had, I guarantee you, he had a gun. I'm sure he had boots on. He had a knife.

264
00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:20.360
Yeah. I was going to say he was probably packed all. Yeah, no doubt about it.

265
00:15:20.361 --> 00:15:23.990
This guy came out of like some crazy like Nashville or something.

266
00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:28.190
This guy was like a biker guy. So he goes, which one is it?

267
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.290
And she pointed to me and he goes, all right, you too,

268
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.420
let's go have some beers on the balcony. And you know,

269
00:15:32.421 --> 00:15:36.050
now we're kind of like when your buddies now got to go outside and drink with

270
00:15:36.051 --> 00:15:38.810
this dude. Yeah. But you know, they're cool with it.

271
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.540
Cause they just want the booze, you know? So they're like, ah, it.

272
00:15:41.541 --> 00:15:44.450
Let's see what happens. That's how it was. But we were feral. We would just did.

273
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:49.910
Whim, no, no plans. And uh, yeah. So I've told this story many times,

274
00:15:49.911 --> 00:15:52.130
but she just sat on the bed. She goes, how do you want to do this? And I go,

275
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:55.550
well, I'm trying to act cool. I'm like, I'll take a blow job first.

276
00:15:55.670 --> 00:16:00.170
And she goes, I don't give blow jobs. And I said, you kids off the street.

277
00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.093
We don't get bloated.

278
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.270
And she was like, I don't think I'm sorry, sorry. Sorry. She goes,

279
00:16:08.271 --> 00:16:10.040
anything else? And I go, are you clean? And she goes,

280
00:16:10.041 --> 00:16:12.560
you want to do this or not? And I was like, Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

281
00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.640
And then she just got new. It's a great, no,

282
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.330
that's one of the best nos I've ever heard.

283
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:24.230
All I know to do this or not. I'm in sorry.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:31.510
Thank you guys. Yeah. You want to start? Uh, let's hear yours,

302
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:31.810
man.

303
00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:34.540
<v 0>All right. Well, one I've had a, I've had a lot of great nights of it.</v>

304
00:17:34.541 --> 00:17:38.800
A lot of bad nights. It's hard to pick the top, but I did the, the, the,

305
00:17:38.801 --> 00:17:43.510
what is that? What's the arena here? Staples. No, no, no forum.

306
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.510
I did the forum once and that was pretty unbelievable. I,

307
00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:51.450
I just killed at the forum. I just, it, it was just sold out,

308
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.940
you know, opening for Schumer. Wouldn't I don't know. What is that?

309
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:58.650
30,000 people or whatever the it is. 20, 22, maybe 22. Yeah.

310
00:17:58.651 --> 00:18:02.640
It was unreal. And it's in a circle and just rocked it and it just,

311
00:18:02.641 --> 00:18:03.570
everything clicked.

312
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.410
I did the Patrice O'Neal benefit and that was a good one with bill and vitamin,

313
00:18:07.411 --> 00:18:08.460
which was like such an honor.

314
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.950
And that just clicked that I remember I went third,

315
00:18:10.951 --> 00:18:13.830
which is like the best spot in his show and just kicked,

316
00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:17.040
kicked it right in the teeth. And it was just, you know,

317
00:18:17.041 --> 00:18:20.010
when your timing is it the laugh and then you, then the laugh, it just worked.

318
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:24.960
Um, and bill said some nice things after. So that was great. But the worst,

319
00:18:24.961 --> 00:18:29.430
probably two months ago during Christmas, uh,

320
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.710
did a bunch of corporate gigs. Do you do corporates?

321
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:34.260
I just did one this week actually. Oh, nice. They're pretty.

322
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.410
They're pretty different. They're not really stand up.

323
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.380
You just kinda like trying to keep these people happy and get your paycheck and

324
00:18:40.381 --> 00:18:43.860
get out of there. Yeah. You don't want to get any HR issues. Yes. Yes.

325
00:18:43.861 --> 00:18:47.640
And I that's exactly what I did. I had to host a pharmaceutical award show,

326
00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:52.590
big hotel ballroom, you know, like white table cloth, fine.

327
00:18:52.591 --> 00:18:57.390
China tuxedos chandelier's and I'm hosting. I got no cards like a stack,

328
00:18:57.391 --> 00:19:01.080
this high of like next up best sleep aid.

329
00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:05.220
Here are the nominees. Like I was that guy. I had a podium and everything,

330
00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.640
and I had to study it and the paycheck was insane. They picked me up in a limo,

331
00:19:08.641 --> 00:19:11.160
drove me out to Philadelphia. I get there.

332
00:19:11.161 --> 00:19:14.670
I'm supposed to do 15 minutes of standup to open just to like get them loose and

333
00:19:14.671 --> 00:19:17.940
then go into the award shows clean, but they knew my stuff.

334
00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:20.670
They watched all my YouTube and they're like, we like your edge and all that.

335
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.460
So just do you, so I just to play it safe.

336
00:19:23.461 --> 00:19:27.570
I did the sign I opened for Seinfeld and I did the Seinfeld set, which you know,

337
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.490
nothing cleaner than Seinfeld. Yeah. Uh, so I go up and out of the gate,

338
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.950
BOM BOM by every joke. And I'm like, all right, well,

339
00:19:34.951 --> 00:19:38.040
let me pull out some heavy hitter. These always work bomb, foolproof bomb.

340
00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:42.150
So I'm like, maybe I'll get a little dirtier. That'll tell, I'll get him. I go,

341
00:19:42.151 --> 00:19:43.860
I do a vibrator joke. I see it.

342
00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.610
I see a table of women get up and leave in like a Huff. And I go, Oh,

343
00:19:47.611 --> 00:19:52.350
that's not good. So I comment on them. Dry women, huh? Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

344
00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.350
These women were not into it.

345
00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:59.190
And so I had my, my get off to like,

346
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.610
I bring these people up to like give a little speech about some kind of drugs

347
00:20:02.611 --> 00:20:06.450
they're selling and I get off. And the CEO of the whole thing is yelling at me.

348
00:20:06.451 --> 00:20:09.330
And he's like, how could you say that about my wife? And then I'm like, wait,

349
00:20:09.331 --> 00:20:11.040
what are you talking? I don't even know who your wife is. And he's like,

350
00:20:11.041 --> 00:20:14.310
my wife is offended. Get the hell out of here. You're fired. You're done.

351
00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.890
I was like, wait, what, what are you talking about? I'm going to tuxedo.

352
00:20:16.891 --> 00:20:21.420
I rented a tux from Joseph, a banks. I'm like, what?

353
00:20:21.421 --> 00:20:24.510
So I go up to like the curator later and she's like, she's crying.

354
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:27.180
Cause he yelled at her first and she's like, she's like, you gotta go.

355
00:20:27.181 --> 00:20:27.571
You gotta go.

356
00:20:27.571 --> 00:20:30.510
We're going to find someone else to host it the whole three more hours in the

357
00:20:30.511 --> 00:20:33.900
show. And I just had to get in the car and go back to Philly. I mean,

358
00:20:33.901 --> 00:20:37.140
go back to New York, brutal. I studied and all this.

359
00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:41.400
And it was like a fine lobster steak dinner. And it was like, so high end.

360
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.830
And this was a big production with like, you know,

361
00:20:43.831 --> 00:20:47.010
a sound booth guy and the lighting guy and the waiters and all this.

362
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:48.490
And I just had to leave.

363
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:54.010
<v 1>But, uh, Netflix is literally has a credo. They'll they'll tell you, Oh yeah,</v>

364
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:57.580
they have quotas. They're locked in. You have a TV show.

365
00:20:57.581 --> 00:21:00.730
We have an Asian director. We have a woman director up there. So it's not,

366
00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.670
doesn't matter. It's, it's, it's less about, I think,

367
00:21:03.671 --> 00:21:06.580
whatever they're doing to what happened in your,

368
00:21:06.581 --> 00:21:08.860
so I had two good pitches before that.

369
00:21:08.861 --> 00:21:10.990
So it was loose and I was zigging and zagging and I was,

370
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:14.890
I was on and we were in there with the Netflix guy and we couldn't get the video

371
00:21:14.891 --> 00:21:17.980
to work, to play the sizzle. And it was just showing like the ceiling and I go,

372
00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:21.280
Oh, it's the Kevin Hart sex table. I'm trying to make jokes. And the guy goes,

373
00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:24.070
can you believe that the woman is suing him for that? And I was like, well,

374
00:21:24.071 --> 00:21:27.370
I think it's the best thing he's ever done. Yeah. If it's funniest funny,

375
00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:29.080
then it's specials. And he was like, you know,

376
00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:33.460
I produced the last four of those. I was like, Oh, well I'm just, just around.

377
00:21:33.461 --> 00:21:35.080
You know, we all love Kevin Hart. And he's like,

378
00:21:35.081 --> 00:21:37.990
I don't think that's appropriate. I mean, he does. He works with Netflix.

379
00:21:37.991 --> 00:21:41.440
I'm like, Oh yeah, I'm just calm. Just busting ball. I love Kevin Hart.

380
00:21:41.441 --> 00:21:42.191
I wish I was him.

381
00:21:42.191 --> 00:21:46.870
He's a little guy and cute and all that pets to go see it, blah, blah,

382
00:21:46.871 --> 00:21:49.900
blah. And he just the whole pitch,

383
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:54.010
I just poured my heart out in this pit shuck and jive and I'm tap dancing.

384
00:21:54.011 --> 00:21:57.220
And he was just like, take a joke.

385
00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:59.830
That's the whole day he's doing something right there. Aren't they.

386
00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.790
<v 0>I got mugged a bunch. But uh, yeah. So I, you know,</v>

387
00:22:04.791 --> 00:22:08.100
I was boozing it up in Cleveland, you know, not bragging.

388
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:12.360
And um, I met this gal. This is years ago, years ago.

389
00:22:12.361 --> 00:22:14.280
And I remember thinking like, all right,

390
00:22:14.281 --> 00:22:16.740
I'm going to be a good guy here and try to do the right thing.

391
00:22:16.741 --> 00:22:19.260
We don't have a condom. So we can't bang. You know,

392
00:22:19.261 --> 00:22:22.500
I'm trying to be a little more responsible and where my hotel room and we're

393
00:22:22.501 --> 00:22:25.560
both kind of, Oh, what do we do in Cleveland? That everything closes.

394
00:22:25.561 --> 00:22:27.840
It's all done. So I was like,

395
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:30.900
I got an idea because we were both wanting to do something. I go,

396
00:22:30.901 --> 00:22:34.050
what if I put it in the Keester? We won't need a condom for that.

397
00:22:34.051 --> 00:22:37.980
You can't get pregnant in the. Not that I've heard. I didn't know of.

398
00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.950
That was the case in gays would be having babies a little bit.

399
00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:47.640
So that would also you're, you're what you're not considering is Sylvia STI.

400
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:52.290
I was like babies. All you're thinking about. Yeah,

401
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.330
because what STD lives in the air. Yeah.

402
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:58.590
Especially the big, the big

403
00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:07.770
in my mind, this was the responsible thing to do. So, uh,

404
00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.010
she was like, all right, great. So we went to town and I remember thinking like,

405
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.250
all right, you gotta pee after. That's how you flush everything. I was really,

406
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:19.170
really trying to be responsible and, and whatever. But, uh, we,

407
00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:23.490
I don't know if you've ever had an STD. No, it hits you about two weeks.

408
00:23:23.491 --> 00:23:27.810
It's usually like 13, 14 days. That's how long it takes to really notice it.

409
00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:32.580
And I remember the next day I was like, God, I got a next day. Yeah.

410
00:23:32.581 --> 00:23:35.490
It was like, so I was like this in my head. I was like,

411
00:23:35.491 --> 00:23:38.370
this is a really bad one. You know, that early.

412
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:43.050
That's what my dumb brain thought like this is a really serious STD.

413
00:23:43.051 --> 00:23:45.060
So immediately I went AIDS. You go right to the,

414
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.500
and then he does a lot of gay or, uh, anal AIDS. You know,

415
00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:53.480
this was a one night stand, correct? Yes. And the anal first date.

416
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.980
Yeah. Anal that's Cleveland one night. Is there? Yeah, that's a Wednesday.

417
00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:01.940
It's the Browns Cleveland Browns baby.

418
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:06.160
I was the mascot. Wow. So, uh, yeah, I,

419
00:24:06.161 --> 00:24:10.640
I had to do the horrible thing. We all hate to do you text the girl next day,

420
00:24:10.641 --> 00:24:14.540
go, Hey, I hate to do this, but do you have anything I should know about?

421
00:24:14.541 --> 00:24:18.650
You know? And uh, she was like, Oh my God, of course not. Geez, I could. Yes.

422
00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.260
And it's just super awkward. I'm like, all right. I just feel weird.

423
00:24:21.261 --> 00:24:25.580
And something's up. I'm just checking. No, no, no judgment. And she's like, no,

424
00:24:25.581 --> 00:24:28.040
no, you, whatever. And I was like, all right. And then, you know,

425
00:24:28.041 --> 00:24:30.980
the next couple of days, it's like, yeah, I am.

426
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.320
I have something bad happening.

427
00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:38.000
Just aching in your Dick in there in it,

428
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:41.720
in it. Does it burn when you pee pee?

429
00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:46.280
Have you it again yourself? You, I guess,

430
00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:49.190
hurt when that came out. No, I was too worried about it.

431
00:24:49.191 --> 00:24:52.460
I didn't want to with it. So I was pee and it didn't burn you.

432
00:24:52.461 --> 00:24:55.730
The burn is the big tail. That's the, that's the go-to.

433
00:24:55.731 --> 00:24:59.450
So this was a no burn and an ache and a pain and a sting. So I'm like,

434
00:24:59.451 --> 00:25:03.660
I don't know. So I thought it was some high level, you know,

435
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:08.600
it's only in your Dick. Yes. It's not radiating in anywhere else. No radiation.

436
00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:13.460
And, uh, I I'm losing it. So I go to the hospital and like the,

437
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:17.270
what do you call the clinic? The one hour clinic. And I do a whole test.

438
00:25:17.271 --> 00:25:20.150
They go, you're clean. And I go, well, I got some something's up.

439
00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.730
And they're like, ah, it's probably in your head. And they're like,

440
00:25:22.731 --> 00:25:27.680
take some antibiotic bugs. That's my. So it was like,

441
00:25:27.681 --> 00:25:30.050
all right, so I'm taking it and you know, nothing's working.

442
00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:31.790
So I know this Dr. Guy,

443
00:25:31.791 --> 00:25:35.810
so I just called him and it just kind of like unloaded on him. And he goes, huh?

444
00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:37.820
I bet you got in your Dick.

445
00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:50.660
[inaudible]. Yeah. And I was like, I don't know.

446
00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.400
<v 2>You ever take that ferry over there from new Orleans over to the West westbound?</v>

447
00:25:54.401 --> 00:25:58.000
Yeah, sure. Mardi Gras world. We'd go there. Yeah. I used to take that one.

448
00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:01.240
My dad all the time. I love that ferry. It was like a buck. Yeah.

449
00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:03.490
That was good times. Yeah. That thing was good.

450
00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.360
Never cost it a dollar to get into new Orleans from the West bank. Every day,

451
00:26:07.361 --> 00:26:10.780
those my friends have to pay a buck to get into the city. They got rid of that,

452
00:26:10.781 --> 00:26:15.220
but that was weird as a kid, like, that's kind of to the wankers. Yeah.

453
00:26:15.221 --> 00:26:18.300
It really is kind of, yeah. You got to pay to get in here. Yeah.

454
00:26:18.301 --> 00:26:20.890
You have to come over there to work and you also got to pay. Yeah.

455
00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:23.590
It was like that coming from Mandeville. It was like you had to pay. Yeah,

456
00:26:23.591 --> 00:26:27.970
it was really, it was a dollar. And then it was a dollar 50 on each side,

457
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.670
Dan, eventually it was just $3 one way.

458
00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:34.150
So the other way you didn't have to stop. You got to pay $3 up top,

459
00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:36.160
longest bridge in America. Yep.

460
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:40.360
I think it was the longest bridge in the world for a while.

461
00:26:40.361 --> 00:26:44.550
And then Japanese built one longer. I got caught on bridge, uh.

462
00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:48.270
<v 0>Bout to get murdered. I don't know if you heard about this, but, uh,</v>

463
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.920
we were stopped on the Causeway. Cause I,

464
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.950
we were getting chased by this guy who was trying to kill us,

465
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.480
me and a couple of high school friends.

466
00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.080
And there was an accident on the Causeway, so it was gridlocked.

467
00:26:58.081 --> 00:26:59.850
So the car had to park and we're like.

468
00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:03.180
And he got out and he was like shaking the car. He was like a big buff guy.

469
00:27:03.181 --> 00:27:05.790
And we were like three squirrely Catholic school kids.

470
00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:09.180
And he had a knife and he was like slicing the side of the car up.

471
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:14.010
And luckily the cops at the Rick saw it and like tased him and pulled him down

472
00:27:14.011 --> 00:27:16.530
and cuffed him. Oh, that's amazing. It was wild. But I was like,

473
00:27:16.531 --> 00:27:18.690
go on the cause, but he won't follow it because it's too long.

474
00:27:18.691 --> 00:27:21.840
But then there was a wreck that Causeway man,

475
00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:24.930
cause to me that was a whole nother world over there where you live. I was like,

476
00:27:24.931 --> 00:27:28.890
I don't know what goes on in Covington and Mandeville and all that. That was a,

477
00:27:28.891 --> 00:27:30.000
I didn't know what that was.
