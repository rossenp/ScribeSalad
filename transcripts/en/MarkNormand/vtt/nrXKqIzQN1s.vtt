00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.601
<v 0>I mean,</v>

2
00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:04.080
it's like if you're in jail for five years and then like a gay guy walks in,

3
00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:05.460
who's kind of dainty or like,

4
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.790
this is a wine winery vineyard that's it is a vineyard it's been

5
00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:23.480
pouring rain. Now a Celine Dion is bumping.

6
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.670
I'm getting a little Misty and I think it's going to be a weird shows, got money

7
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.640
[inaudible] to be here and pry them. Make sure I say that. Right. I said,

8
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.130
Priyam earlier. I thought I said the N word pretty flipped out.

9
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.700
Since I'm too scared to ask for another water,

10
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.100
I'm going to fill this up in the bathroom. Like a psycho

11
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.930
for water for Christ's sake.

12
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.940
No dice guests were gone in that bathroom sink

13
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.450
came over here. We're sold out two shows. 5:00 PM, 7:00 PM.

14
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.670
Should it be interesting if I smoke half I'm good, but if I do the whole thing,

15
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.320
no, you're not supposed to inhale. Oh, Helen,

16
00:01:12.321 --> 00:01:13.154
for years,

17
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.230
[inaudible] tested positive for the full hour.

18
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.250
We'll open with Corona and then go into the real stuff.

19
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.260
[inaudible] Hey comedy, huh? Yeah. NBA.

20
00:01:33.261 --> 00:01:37.460
The seats are empty. How weird is that theory? I got an idea.

21
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.310
All those racist statutes and tore down.

22
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.830
Let's put them in the seats just to fill it up. You know,

23
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.040
I think that would motivate the players. LeBron's like, is that,

24
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.990
is that robbery Lee? All right. We're going to win this one.

25
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.210
He didn't have herpes before. You'll get it. Now. There you go. All right.

26
00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:55.700
I'm joking. I don't have herpes. Just limited

27
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.330
urination. Thank you. Ooh boy.

28
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.070
Ah, I'm a real hole. Grace, the wet the bed. So, uh,

29
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.100
now the fake hand wash for the people at home,

30
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.340
go for these outdoor gigs.

31
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.700
You've got to just hammer them with punchlines or else you lose them because

32
00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:20.390
there's no connection. There's no ceiling. So you just got to keep pounding him.

33
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.110
Corona, starting to feel like the check engine light in your car. At first,

34
00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:28.100
it's scary. But after a while you're like, it. I got to go to work. Boy,

35
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.430
killing on the right left sides of book club over there.

36
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.500
This is lights out. I got cocaine over here. And then Tylenol PM

37
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.670
for you Jews right here. Huh? Saving the day. I was scrounging Burr for minutes.

38
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.180
Just trying to take up more time. We lost her again. Okay. All right.

39
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.990
All right. I thought you were doing, doing Coke. I was going to say, you know,

40
00:02:53.991 --> 00:02:58.880
I get, it's a lot of bumps. She's a fun. Okay, good. Well,

41
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.220
me photos of whatever you guys scissor. Um, cool.

42
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.320
He's a fun girl. Huh? I was out of stuff. I was just tap, dancing up there.

43
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:10.630
I had nothing. It's a scary feeling.

44
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:13.690
Just doing the cliff is at your back and you got to think of something.

45
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.970
There's actually people staying in this hotel. They must be like, Oh,

46
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:20.050
there's that cult again? Just sitting out there drinking.

47
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.210
Isn't getting awkward. Huh? But up here too long,

48
00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:25.300
it feels like we all and I won't leave. Thanks a lot.

49
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:27.880
I'm Kevin Hart and you guys are great. Have a good night.

50
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.480
[inaudible] Let's see what this beer is all about.

51
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.520
Love your sober down the drain.

52
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.270
That's another gig and the books we pulled it off. We'll see you in hell.

53
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.270
