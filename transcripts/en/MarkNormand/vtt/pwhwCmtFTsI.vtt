00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.710
<v 0>The guy goes, Hey, I'm bringing the bike in from Jersey.</v>

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.800
Can you meet me at the Holland tunnel at eight,

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.780
the Holland tunnel come all into the city. He's like, Oh, I'm already,

4
00:00:11.781 --> 00:00:15.650
you're lucky. I'm bringing it in. I don't want to find your, which I get.

5
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.800
I'm appreciative of the bring in. Okay. So I go, all right, well,

6
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.100
I'll have to sell her all night. That's not far. That's not far.

7
00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:25.340
I could probably walk, but here's the clinker. I finally get my,

8
00:00:25.341 --> 00:00:29.570
a calendar coming on. I got a seven o'clock an eight, 10,

9
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.850
and then like an, a, uh, an 11. So I'm like, ah. How am I going to do an eight,

10
00:00:34.851 --> 00:00:36.650
10? If he's showing up at eight, the Holland tunnel.

11
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.910
So I do some mixing and matching. I get on at nine,

12
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.340
I do the seven o'clock run to the tunnel, get the bike,

13
00:00:43.341 --> 00:00:47.000
hand him the big wad of cash. I got to lose that drunk all day.

14
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.690
Just had a couple grand in my back pocket. I give him the cash.

15
00:00:50.691 --> 00:00:53.690
He shows me the bike and he goes, it's a great bike, great condition.

16
00:00:53.691 --> 00:00:57.500
I'll show it to you. It's mint. He's at the 1980. Garelli it's an Italian.

17
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.570
MOPA this thing looks like a fun dragon baby. 1980. I went vintage.

18
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.070
Wow. The new ones are so cunty. So I wanted some, some zip. Okay.

19
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.530
So this guy is like a moped head. He's got all these,

20
00:01:09.531 --> 00:01:11.810
he's got like a garage full he's. Like, this is my pride and joy.

21
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.430
I don't want to sell it, but I had a kid and I'm gay and all this I'm like,

22
00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:17.180
all right. So I go, I'll just ride it back to the seller.

23
00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:20.540
I'm at the Holland tunnel. I can't start it. What?

24
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.620
He told me why he thought I lied. I said I was a big moped guy.

25
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.150
Wait, what did he take back? Did he walk through the tunnel? He drove his truck.

26
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.610
Oh, it was on the truck. Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah.

27
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.290
I thought he was driving the moped pop, smoke and disappeared. Right, right.

28
00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:39.710
I don't know if you can pull that, that hog to a tunnel. It's that'd be a risky.

29
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.850
I mean, they go about 60, but still all right. You don't get honked at all day,

30
00:01:43.851 --> 00:01:47.000
but yeah. So now I got this bike and I'm on and like 20 minutes.

31
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.980
Cause he showed me, he did a walk around and he's like, this is a,

32
00:01:48.981 --> 00:01:51.680
this is a clutch. The exhaust, the choke. I don't know any of this.

33
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.820
I'm panicking. I'm like, yeah. The choke up, choke you in bed, you know,

34
00:01:55.821 --> 00:01:59.090
whatever. And he's like, all right, buddy, we've kind of made friends.

35
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.670
We exchanged hellos and goodbyes.

36
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.140
And now I'm on the side of the highway or whatever, West side highway area.

37
00:02:06.141 --> 00:02:10.580
Just like trying to start kicking it. I'm twisting it. I'm turning it.

38
00:02:10.581 --> 00:02:13.250
I'm juking. It I'm Googling. How do you start a moped?

39
00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:17.150
I'm half drunk time cars are honking at me. It's like a horror movie.

40
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.040
It was bad. So I just walk it to the seller. It takes me forever.

41
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.640
Cause it's heavy as. I'm just w w you know, glug, glug along.

42
00:02:25.641 --> 00:02:28.220
This is the saddest thing I've ever heard. So sad. I'm starting. I'm going,

43
00:02:28.221 --> 00:02:31.640
what am I doing with my life? I'm faced to how, what am I 18? You know,

44
00:02:31.641 --> 00:02:34.850
am I pushing a bike? I just paid a couple grand to a guy with an envelope.

45
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.250
He pulled up on a truck. He's from Jersey, had an earring.

46
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.940
The idea of walking a vehicle is so, so depressing.

47
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.240
And now I've got to bring it to the seller where everybody goes, what's that?

48
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.960
Start it up. Can I ride it? I'm not ready. I can't even start it myself.

49
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.080
So I got a lot on my plate here. That's not a bad move though.

50
00:02:51.081 --> 00:02:52.130
You give someone pushing to right.

51
00:02:52.131 --> 00:02:55.520
You're going to Dean Del Ray or some bike guy. He'd be like, take it for a spin.

52
00:02:55.521 --> 00:02:58.280
That's true video. What he does. And then all of a sudden you got it.

53
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.660
That's not, but I, I kind of have a bucket moment,

54
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.930
like a block away from the seller where I go, all right, you loser,

55
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.530
you're getting this thing started. So I Google it or YouTube. It like, okay,

56
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:12.730
that's something. I pull that clutch. I pop it, starts it up.

57
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.100
I get on it. I go all over the shop. It was a revelation.

58
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.690
I felt like a new man.

59
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.880
<v 1>Wow. I had like a.</v>

60
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.800
<v 0>What do you call it? A pithany.</v>

61
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.360
<v 2>So what I picture in, is it like a Vesper where you feed her on the thing?</v>

62
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.700
It looks like a really skinny, shorter motorcycle. Okay. So it's like a,

63
00:03:32.701 --> 00:03:37.020
it's closer to a dirt bike than a Vesper. Yeah. Yeah. It looks wise for sure.

64
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.500
But.

65
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.540
<v 0>It's more of the power of a Vesper.</v>

66
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.320
<v 2>I guess. I don't know what a bullpen is. Motor pedal. What does that mean?</v>

67
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.670
Maybe, maybe that's it.

68
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.060
<v 0>Bicycle with pedals, mostly pedals. Ah, but you don't,</v>

69
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.920
you don't pedal now, but you, there are there for your feet.

70
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.200
<v 2>Okay. So it's like, do you kick it to start?</v>

71
00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:58.680
A kick is one of those things that's sexy. It's pretty cool.

72
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.540
Isaac would for this thing. Oh yeah. He's all over it. Big waft for that.

73
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.170
<v 0>So I get it started and I go, all right, I've got about 15 minutes of my set.</v>

74
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.530
I'm half in the bag. So my first ride on this thing, I'm house. Yeah.

75
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.010
You're breaking the law. Yeah. And I don't have a helmet, uh, whatever.

76
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.490
It's not registered. So I'm riding around the Hudson and Bleecker.

77
00:04:17.491 --> 00:04:21.270
And I'm just like where the sun is in my face. I mean, the witness's in my face.

78
00:04:21.271 --> 00:04:23.460
I'm having a great time. I'm like, this is the best thing I've ever done.

79
00:04:23.461 --> 00:04:26.370
I went from, what the hell am I doing with my life? I suck.

80
00:04:26.371 --> 00:04:29.490
I'm on the side of the road with a vehicle that doesn't work. I got ripped off.

81
00:04:29.491 --> 00:04:33.270
I thought by this church, now I'm riding down the Hudson people going, Hey,

82
00:04:33.271 --> 00:04:37.140
one guy goes great. Moped. I felt like Kramer. Oh, it was amazing.

83
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.130
That's a girl's bike.

84
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.640
So I pull that hog up to the VU. They let me park it inside, right? Yeah.

85
00:04:44.641 --> 00:04:47.190
You know where the, the velvet rope thing is, how's.

86
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.290
<v 2>The parking going to work and you put it on the sidewalk and.</v>

87
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.320
<v 0>I get, I'm nervous though. You could throw that thing in a truck. It's heavy,</v>

88
00:04:52.321 --> 00:04:54.630
but I have a lock for it, but still I'm nervous.

89
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.960
<v 2>Yeah. You gotta get one of those big locks. I guess. I gotta, I gotta,</v>

90
00:04:57.961 --> 00:04:59.580
I gotta see this because I can't visualize.

91
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:00.750
You're going to have when you see it.

92
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.320
<v 0>So I go, all right. I pull it right in there. Everybody's like, ah,</v>

93
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.320
already Fuqua is like filming me. Like what? All this awesome.

94
00:05:07.321 --> 00:05:10.560
He's a millionaire. That was fun. Bolt died.

95
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.390
He doesn't have one of these though. Nope. Not a 1980 Garelli so, uh,

96
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.690
I do my set, whatever, get off stage and I just go,

97
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.130
I couldn't wait to get back on it. And I just zip around with no phone really,

98
00:05:23.131 --> 00:05:26.940
by the way. So no, one's bothered me and I've just cool wind in my hair,

99
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.450
learning the moped, feeling it, getting it. I know how to start it. Now.

100
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.690
It was a, it was a really a special day. Now. Where do you.

101
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.910
<v 2>Park it at home? Is it just out there right now?</v>

102
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.080
<v 0>It's chained up to the,</v>

103
00:05:37.081 --> 00:05:41.160
I have a gate on the sidewalk is chained up to the gate and I got a cover over

104
00:05:41.161 --> 00:05:41.994
it.

105
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.340
<v 2>Well, this is a real, this is a trip down memory lane.</v>

106
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.840
<v 0>Well, you want to get on the lane? I had a wacky night last night.</v>

107
00:05:48.841 --> 00:05:53.040
I got to bring up, you know, the mopeds. It's a staple. Now my, in my life,

108
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.350
people are talking a lot of messages, a lot of tweets about it.

109
00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.190
I did five sets last night and I go, Hey,

110
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:03.050
I'm bringing the hog out. This is the perfect night for the hog.

111
00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:05.360
It's 75 degrees. I'll throw on a light jacket.

112
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.100
<v 2>Are we calling it a hog? Now I'm calling it a hog. Did you name it?</v>

113
00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.810
The name of bike or is that just the boat? You name it? [inaudible] a boat.

114
00:06:13.811 --> 00:06:18.100
You name a lady? I don't want to get on a lady and ride it.

115
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.000
Maybe bill.

116
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.230
<v 0>A buildup it.</v>

117
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.740
<v 2>All right there. I'll call it bill until you come up with something better.</v>

118
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.760
I like hug. Alright. We'll do hug hug. You know,

119
00:06:27.761 --> 00:06:31.960
I grew up in hog Memorial drive. Ah, wow. A lot of fat chicks. All right.

120
00:06:31.961 --> 00:06:33.070
So you're all really though.

121
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.250
<v 0>Come on the hug bill and uh, you know,</v>

122
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.880
it's per nicely and me and the lady go out and have a couple of beers. You know?

123
00:06:39.881 --> 00:06:41.770
She's like I got out of work early. It's a beautiful day.

124
00:06:41.771 --> 00:06:45.320
We go sit at [inaudible] on Greenwich jab and have a couple of pops in,

125
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.140
in the summertime. So I made up that true story. We go up there and then I go,

126
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.560
Oh, I gotta get to the stand. And she goes, well, I'm going to get some food.

127
00:06:53.561 --> 00:06:55.930
I'm going to go to this place over here. And I go get on the hug.

128
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.390
I'll drive into the food and then I'll go to the stand. Wow.

129
00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.390
So now I got the hog cooking.

130
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.400
I got the on the back. We go down to the food place and she's going,

131
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:11.320
I got to tell you this, this, this bill is, is hitting exactly my clips.

132
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.290
<v 2>That's the thing with bikes. The women loved the bikes. I had no idea.</v>

133
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.920
It was a myth. No, that's no myth. They come everywhere. Yeah. So sh.

134
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.040
<v 0>She's holding me for dear anal and I'm going to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.</v>

135
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.880
We're at the red light. And she's like, I'm getting off, like not off the bike,

136
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.350
I'm getting off this.

137
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.890
It feels exactly like my vibrator just smells like gasoline.

138
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.640
And uh, so I was like, wow, this is hot. So she's hugging me.

139
00:07:33.641 --> 00:07:36.610
I can feel her legs clapping. You know, I was like, this is amazing.

140
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.200
I never thought I'd be this guy.

141
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.330
I never thought I'd have that moment in my life where I'm a blah, blah, blah.

142
00:07:40.331 --> 00:07:41.350
And she's going, I'm so tired.

143
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.190
<v 2>Wow. My life by, by kids,</v>

144
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:47.980
myself in a room. So.

145
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.410
<v 0>I drop her off and she's all hot and bothered.</v>

146
00:07:50.411 --> 00:07:51.970
I had to give her a couple of napkins.

147
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.770
I get back on the hug to go to the next set. But I got like a half hour 45, man.

148
00:07:56.771 --> 00:08:01.240
I got plenty of time. Greg stone, Rachel Feinstein and Nancy DeVito there.

149
00:08:01.241 --> 00:08:03.280
And they're having a good time there. They're cool.

150
00:08:03.281 --> 00:08:06.190
And out and drinking and everything. And they go, let's see the bike. And I go,

151
00:08:06.191 --> 00:08:10.720
all right. And I go, I gotta run though. So I try to start it. It won't start.

152
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.880
I go, this is embarrassing. They're going everything over.

153
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.820
<v 2>Right. And it's so embarrassing. Cause there was like, it's a bike. Here we go.</v>

154
00:08:15.821 --> 00:08:20.020
We've heard about it. All right. And that's just all right. You know, nothing.

155
00:08:20.021 --> 00:08:22.410
I looked like an idiot. Boy. I need others already.

156
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.860
<v 0>The bike jokes. And uh, you know, anytime a comic does something outlandish,</v>

157
00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:27.820
you got to cut it.

158
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:32.020
<v 2>Anything different. You wear a hat, people like what are you a hat guy?</v>

159
00:08:32.021 --> 00:08:33.790
Now you piece of. You are a hammer.

160
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.180
<v 0>Loop on your gene. You're a mechanic. All the sudden. It's a whole thing.</v>

161
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.780
They'll find it. Even if you're eating a hotdog, the hotdog is the focus.

162
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:46.360
You know, comics are so the bike won't start. And uh, I'm so embarrassed.

163
00:08:46.361 --> 00:08:50.050
I feel like a kid again where like, I can't get it going. I can't get it up.

164
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.140
And so I go, well, let's get a drink. Let's get a drink. You know?

165
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.280
So I have to walk them back inside. And then when they get drink,

166
00:08:56.281 --> 00:08:58.830
they start talking. I run back out and try to start it with. So.

167
00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:01.550
<v 2>It was so embarrassing. You're like Clark Griswold with the lights,</v>

168
00:09:01.551 --> 00:09:02.990
the Christmas lights, the lights.

169
00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:04.790
<v 0>Hanukkah.</v>

170
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:09.710
So now I'm so embarrassed that I just pop the kickstand and just

171
00:09:09.711 --> 00:09:14.540
walk it around the corner so I can start it in peace and not be embarrassed.

172
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.300
Right. And, uh, it's still nothing, nothing. I mean.

173
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:20.503
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

174
00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.170
<v 0>Oh, what am I doing? My life? I hate myself. Well, it is from the forties,</v>

175
00:09:24.171 --> 00:09:28.460
this thing, 1986. So I was like, what did I,

176
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.770
what am I doing wrong? I'm changing and with the choke up.

177
00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:34.880
Turn on the reserve gas. I bled I'm tinkering. I'm like a man down there.

178
00:09:34.881 --> 00:09:38.630
I take my jacket off. I roll the sleeves up. I have a cigarette. I'm tinkering.

179
00:09:38.631 --> 00:09:40.070
I'm hating blacks. The whole thing.

180
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.100
<v 2>I took the jacket off. Then you roll the sleeves up shirts leave. Huh?</v>

181
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:47.000
<v 0>I see. Yeah, it's hot out. So I go, it. The clock is ticking.</v>

182
00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:50.540
So I have to walk it to New York comedy club like.

183
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.350
<v 2>Oh my God, blocks. Whatever is humiliating. Humiliated.</v>

184
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.290
<v 0>I'm in the street. Bikes are passing me cause I can't get it on the sidewalk.</v>

185
00:09:57.291 --> 00:10:00.860
It's too clunky. Oh my God. I suck.

186
00:10:00.861 --> 00:10:04.940
So I park it and uh, I try to start it again in New York comedy club

187
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:11.090
kind of bucks, but it won't catch. And some guy walks by and goes,

188
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:12.320
that's outta gas.

189
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:16.760
<v 2>Oh geez. The gas.</v>

190
00:10:16.761 --> 00:10:21.440
I forgot about gas. Oh my God. I guess I forgot gas existed.

191
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.660
<v 0>I live in New York. I got a, I got a moped. I have a.</v>

192
00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.750
<v 2>Gas situation myself. When I rent a car, I forgot about the gas.</v>

193
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:31.280
Cause it feels you rented it. It's someone else's gas. It should be full.

194
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:35.750
<v 0>So I guess when the guy gave it to me, it was low or whatever, you know?</v>

195
00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:39.590
Cause it goes 8,000 miles to the gallon. But so now I'm like, all right,

196
00:10:39.591 --> 00:10:41.210
well let me Google gas station.

197
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.670
<v 2>Yes. There's nothing. This is Manhattan. There's a yes.</v>

198
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.680
<v 0>And there's one on eighth Avenue.</v>

199
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.600
<v 2>All the way, Easter, all the way away.</v>

200
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.410
<v 0>So I go, I got three more sets. So I locked the bike up.</v>

201
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.020
Everybody's making fun of me out of gas. You're an idiot, blah, blah. Yeah.

202
00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:00.440
Do the set. I run to the seller, do the set.

203
00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.360
I run to the VU, do a set. And then I go,

204
00:11:05.361 --> 00:11:07.820
I guess I gotta go pick up the bike, but I don't want to pick it up.

205
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.860
I'm mad at the bike. I hate the bike.

206
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:13.100
So I'm sitting there with Jay and Shults and Sam and Phil handler.

207
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.370
It was such a good hang. Then Wolf shows up. Now we all start pounding them.

208
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.370
Wow. What a hat?

209
00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:22.160
It was a killer hang was designed as a couple Epic as they say so now we're

210
00:11:22.161 --> 00:11:24.980
putting them back. We're putting them back. These kids can booze, man.

211
00:11:24.981 --> 00:11:29.210
You don't chase an animal and Wolf's the deviant. And we're having a great time.

212
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.800
Now I look at my watch it's.

213
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:35.600
<v 2>Oh really? I still got to pick up the bike, get somebody else.</v>

214
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:39.290
<v 0>Snag that thing. If I leave it out there, somebody stole my bike, cover.</v>

215
00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:45.410
<v 2>Jesus, can you believe it? What are you supposed to do about this?</v>

216
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:48.170
I guess it's like nuts in a basketball hoop where it's just like,

217
00:11:48.171 --> 00:11:50.450
that's the thing. You, you keep them as long as they're like, well,

218
00:11:50.451 --> 00:11:54.040
we played basketball and a story of here moody McCarthy would.

219
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.400
<v 3>Always bring a net cause somebody just take him. So you'd just put it up.</v>

220
00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.460
And we started just taking them down with us and put it in your pocket and

221
00:12:00.461 --> 00:12:02.200
leave. But you can't do that with a bike cover,

222
00:12:02.201 --> 00:12:04.570
but it seems like it's kind of like the basketball net.

223
00:12:04.571 --> 00:12:05.680
It's just something that gets taken.

224
00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:10.240
<v 0>Yeah, I guess so. I mean fool me once I'm a cook fool me twice a month.</v>

225
00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.410
Huge for me three times about come goes like Nazi over here,

226
00:12:13.411 --> 00:12:18.300
but I found a solution and I think I'm going to crack the code and beat the

227
00:12:18.301 --> 00:12:19.134
crux.

228
00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:24.930
So I've been Googling bike covers and I saw one

229
00:12:24.931 --> 00:12:28.920
with a hole at the bottom that you can put the lock through.

230
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:34.380
So now the locks going through the hole, through the wheel and on to the post.

231
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.500
<v 3>Now let me ask you this. Is there any damage to the bike?</v>

232
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:41.310
Are they stealing the cover and then taking a on the hood or whatever?

233
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:44.790
<v 0>This is the weird thing is I studied this and I mean, I got,</v>

234
00:12:44.791 --> 00:12:45.870
I could talk about this for an hour,

235
00:12:45.871 --> 00:12:49.230
but I took a bunch of CBD I'm out of sleeping pills. So I was like, ah,

236
00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:53.160
all I got CBD. So I guzzled it. And if you guzzle CBD,

237
00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:58.200
you will get high. Cause there's like a, it's almost like non-alcoholic beer.

238
00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.040
If you drink 90 of them you'll feel a buzz. Sure. Yeah.

239
00:13:02.041 --> 00:13:05.220
So I was pretty high and I, when I get high, I'm paranoid,

240
00:13:05.221 --> 00:13:09.750
the wife's out of town. So I was just laying in my, my apartment in the dark,

241
00:13:09.751 --> 00:13:12.180
you know, with the covers up to my nose whimpering.

242
00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.760
And I kept hearing this homeless person outside going

243
00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:20.460
[inaudible] you know, and now you're even more paranoid. So I'm panicking.

244
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:24.510
I'm wetting the bed, the sheets of yellow. And I say, it.

245
00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:28.110
You're you're 36 years old, go to bed. You're fine. You're just high.

246
00:13:28.111 --> 00:13:30.990
You're paranoid. I go to bed, I wake up the cover's gone.

247
00:13:30.991 --> 00:13:33.300
So I assume this hobo nagged it,

248
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:37.980
nabbed it and went and made a little bed out of it or a canopy or a mosquito

249
00:13:37.981 --> 00:13:38.814
net.

250
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:42.420
<v 3>Well, that would be almost the best case scenario if like a homeless,</v>

251
00:13:42.421 --> 00:13:45.600
crazy person. Got it. Because at least you were of service. You know,

252
00:13:45.601 --> 00:13:47.640
maybe he made a tent out of it. He can live in it.

253
00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:50.400
If it's just some whippersnappers stealing it, you know,

254
00:13:50.401 --> 00:13:55.020
to wipe his with or some other dude who lost his. So he's taking yours.

255
00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.590
That sucks. But if maybe if it's a kook, you can look at it, you know,

256
00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:00.570
switch angles and say, Hey,

257
00:14:00.571 --> 00:14:03.540
he needed it more than I did all that that no one brushes.

258
00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:08.340
<v 0>Right? Right. Well that then they asked if the bike is in disrepair,</v>

259
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:13.170
the only thing I saw, and this is kooky and jarring and it makes your,

260
00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.670
your Dick whole sweat.

261
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:19.950
There was a pile of cigarette Ash on the seat. Um,

262
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.850
what the hell is that? I don't like that. I don't like that either.

263
00:14:23.851 --> 00:14:25.950
That means somebody goes, this guy.

264
00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:28.860
So like in the eighties.

265
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.070
<v 3>Did he burn a hole through the fabric?</v>

266
00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:36.180
<v 0>No, whole it's a, it's a, like a pleather seat and it just had the pile on it,</v>

267
00:14:36.181 --> 00:14:41.070
but I wiped it and it was pretty, it was fine. So, so yeah,

268
00:14:41.071 --> 00:14:45.270
so that that's a, a bummer. So I got the new one coming. It's got the lock hole.

269
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.220
So now when they try to rip it off,

270
00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:49.890
they're gonna have to take the whole street sign, baby,

271
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:53.000
check on the hog gone.

272
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:57.620
What gone, the lock has gone. The, the, the, the,

273
00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:02.570
the cover is gone. The stain on the cement, the oil leak is gone.

274
00:15:02.571 --> 00:15:03.560
The whole thing's gone.

275
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.500
<v 3>What is the, they clean the leak. That's nice.</v>

276
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:11.090
<v 0>I think that clean the link link soup. I think that,</v>

277
00:15:11.091 --> 00:15:12.050
I think I got towed.

278
00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:16.390
<v 3>Oh, tow. So this just happened like today or yesterday.</v>

279
00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:17.890
<v 0>Yeah. I came outside today. I said,</v>

280
00:15:17.891 --> 00:15:22.360
I'm gonna go do some pull-ups on the scaffolding, like a. And, uh, the,

281
00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.850
the bike was not a gun.

282
00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.880
<v 3>Is insane. I mean, where was it parked?</v>

283
00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.600
So it was parked somewhat illegally that you think it got towed or could it have

284
00:15:31.601 --> 00:15:33.820
been stolen or what? Well, here.

285
00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.160
<v 0>Here's the clinker. The neighbors hate it.</v>

286
00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:40.210
I got a bunch of geezers and old bags living in this building.

287
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.270
And I think they hate it. The supers, like, you know, the neighbors,

288
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:46.140
they're all squawking about the hog and I'm like, God,

289
00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:50.560
these cocoon loving guns. And uh,

290
00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.800
yeah. So I think enough calls came in.

291
00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:58.450
Here's why I think it was towed because it was too clean of a job.

292
00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.560
I inspected, I got a magnifying glass. I went elementary Watson up your.

293
00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:06.610
I got down on my hands and knees. I'm sniffing pebbles and do it, you know,

294
00:16:06.611 --> 00:16:11.230
feeling the railroad track, like a native American. And it's too clean of a job.

295
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:15.700
I mean, if they cut the lock, there'd be some dust or metal shavings.

296
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:16.960
It's too good.

297
00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:19.810
<v 3>Boy. This is a bummer. That thing is,</v>

298
00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:23.320
has been nothing but trouble since the day you were born. I mean,

299
00:16:23.321 --> 00:16:27.850
it's like the time machine, you got to destroy this thing because you know,

300
00:16:27.851 --> 00:16:32.380
you got it to see where we've been, where we're going to figure out, you know,

301
00:16:32.381 --> 00:16:37.240
humanity, but you know, you're traveling back in time to rape your mom. So,

302
00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.210
you know, your dad doesn't die. I mean, this is getting strange.

303
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:45.910
<v 0>It's, it's a Biff. It's up my. I'm wearing 3d glasses. Uh,</v>

304
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.310
it's the power of love. I'm screwed here.

305
00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.340
I've had a couple of nice moments on it. You know what if my bike is like,

306
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:55.240
it's like a retarded sun, you get a couple of moments.

307
00:16:55.241 --> 00:16:59.740
He's eaten jelly. His hands are sticky. You know, he's cute. He can lift a car.

308
00:16:59.741 --> 00:17:04.600
He's got a huge dog, but it's still sad. Every night I got to check on it.

309
00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:05.920
I got to make sure it's still there.

310
00:17:05.921 --> 00:17:08.620
I got to make sure the Puerto Rican kids aren't going to kill him.

311
00:17:08.621 --> 00:17:13.330
Or he doesn't a toaster or whatever it is. But you got a couple of joy,

312
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.850
joyful moments, but the rest is misery and war.

313
00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:19.840
<v 3>Well, you got to do what you do with the retarded son. I mean, it's, you know,</v>

314
00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.170
it's no one wants to hear it, but you gotta, you gotta put some weights on it,

315
00:17:23.171 --> 00:17:28.010
throw it in the river or sell it. I mean, sell it for parts and buy a,

316
00:17:28.011 --> 00:17:30.130
a non retard vehicle.

317
00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:32.680
<v 0>But.</v>

318
00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.110
<v 3>Also by the way, the thing is beautiful.</v>

319
00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:39.970
But I did see you riding it for the first time. That's a noisy son of a.

320
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.300
I mean, I can see why all the neighbors would hate. Yeah. You drove by,

321
00:17:43.301 --> 00:17:44.950
I was walking down the street and I said,

322
00:17:44.951 --> 00:17:47.710
if I was in an apartment that you were driving by,

323
00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:53.100
I'd call up the and say, Hey, listen, we got a, we got a troublemaker out here.

324
00:17:53.101 --> 00:17:56.610
That things louder than my, my, my sister's on a Wednesday night.

325
00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:02.180
<v 0>Hi, it's got a queen, like a, like a John Deere. I get ya. It's eighties.</v>

326
00:18:02.181 --> 00:18:04.580
It's from the eighties. Everything was louder in the eighties, you know,

327
00:18:04.581 --> 00:18:09.410
share the other guy, Bano eighties, baby. Uh,

328
00:18:09.411 --> 00:18:13.610
so yeah, it's old. It's a, two-stroke much like Louie, but, uh, yeah,

329
00:18:13.611 --> 00:18:16.850
it's brutal. So, uh, I don't know what to do.

330
00:18:16.851 --> 00:18:19.760
Maybe I'll put it in hock or whatever. Put it in the garage.

331
00:18:19.761 --> 00:18:23.720
I'll I'll put it in the Smithsonian with the puffy shirt. I don't know. But, uh,

332
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:26.570
you're right. It's it's brought me a lot of hassle.

333
00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:28.910
<v 3>I mean, this is getting crazy. So what do you do?</v>

334
00:18:28.911 --> 00:18:32.810
You got to call the city or you call nine 11. You call your parents. What,

335
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:34.790
what happens? What's the next step?

336
00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:38.660
<v 0>The parents won't answer. So I'm just going to go down to the, uh, the DMA Anil,</v>

337
00:18:38.661 --> 00:18:43.190
and then let them put a big uncle, Sam, Dick up my. And,

338
00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.250
uh, you know, I gotta pay for the shipping costs.

339
00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:50.810
Then you got to get the thing out of there. And, uh, yeah, it's a whole thing.

340
00:18:50.811 --> 00:18:53.390
I don't have to go. I'm sorry. I don't have to go to the DMV.

341
00:18:53.391 --> 00:18:54.350
I have to go to the impound.

342
00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.080
<v 3>Right? So let me ask you this. What,</v>

343
00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:02.090
how do you take care of that vehicle? Legally? Like, if you were like,

344
00:19:02.091 --> 00:19:05.180
I'm tired of this, what do I, what do you do with the vehicle?

345
00:19:05.181 --> 00:19:07.720
What are you supposed to do? Put it in your apartment, put it on,

346
00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:10.700
get a parking garage. Where,

347
00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.100
where and how can you park this vehicle?

348
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.350
Cause it sounds like you can't park it anywhere.

349
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:16.970
<v 0>I know it's weird.</v>

350
00:19:16.971 --> 00:19:19.850
I parked on the sidewalk every day of my life and it got towed.

351
00:19:19.851 --> 00:19:23.840
Once you remember the big saga a year ago, because I didn't have a plate on it.

352
00:19:23.841 --> 00:19:26.540
I didn't have it registered at him and insured. Okay, I'll give you that.

353
00:19:26.541 --> 00:19:29.510
I get it. But now I got to play it on it. It's registered.

354
00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:34.010
It's got a spit shine. I got, I got new tires on there. And uh,

355
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:38.750
I think this is just the call enough. And uh, you know, you get a lot changed,

356
00:19:38.751 --> 00:19:41.510
you know, no more choke holds or by the police or whatever the hell.

357
00:19:41.511 --> 00:19:43.100
So I think that's what happened.

358
00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:47.600
<v 3>So you think your hypothesis is the neighbors kept calling the police saying,</v>

359
00:19:47.601 --> 00:19:50.060
Hey, you got to get rid of this bike. It's killing us.

360
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:54.140
<v 0>I think so. And they probably said, Hey, it's a hazard. I'm 900 years old.</v>

361
00:19:54.141 --> 00:19:57.980
I could trip on the kickstand and fall on my hip and uh, you know,

362
00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:02.060
die in the shower. I've fallen. I can't get up. So I think that's what it is.

363
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:05.480
But I hope it's at the impound. That's the sad part of life.

364
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:08.810
It's the impound would be hell, just to get it out there as a whole thing,

365
00:20:08.811 --> 00:20:12.500
you got to wait there with a bunch of construction workers going de Blasio.

366
00:20:12.501 --> 00:20:17.210
I'll eat his out with a Spode, you know? And, uh,

367
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.750
so I hope it's at the inbound, but it's not it's stolen. The,

368
00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:24.200
the hog is back and the neighbors hate it.

369
00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.590
It was a neighbor who called the cops on the hog. They got a tote. I mean,

370
00:20:27.591 --> 00:20:31.310
these neighbors are ruthless. They hate the hog. They hate fun. They hate me.

371
00:20:31.311 --> 00:20:35.990
They hate comedy. They hate jokes. They hate bikes. It was up on the sidewalk.

372
00:20:35.991 --> 00:20:39.170
I had it safe everyday, locked up. I can't do that anymore.

373
00:20:39.171 --> 00:20:42.590
I'm scared a old man, Ronald is going to call the cops again.

374
00:20:42.591 --> 00:20:46.190
So I have to park it like a, like a Schmo every day.

375
00:20:46.191 --> 00:20:50.560
I got to go look at the Tuesday, 11 to four. Okay. And then I gotta move it.

376
00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:54.840
<v 2>Well, I say, these neighbors. They're rats. They're,</v>

377
00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:59.970
but Hey, you, dude. You got to park. I mean, what do you want?

378
00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:01.740
What do you want me to do about it? You got a vehicle.

379
00:21:01.741 --> 00:21:05.070
You've got a park that son of a. Well, my point is, and I hear you.

380
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:10.080
<v 0>Loud and clear, but the thing is, it's fine on the sidewalk,</v>

381
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:11.580
this bicycles on the sidewalk,

382
00:21:11.581 --> 00:21:15.480
they just didn't like this on the sidewalk is the street I live on is historic.

383
00:21:15.481 --> 00:21:19.650
And they got to have it look at nice. And that was an eyesore. And you know, uh,

384
00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:24.750
this, this guy who was in the Korean war and he voted for Hoover Hayden,

385
00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.540
like it looking bad on the streets. So that's it.

386
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:32.700
<v 2>Well, he may be a stickler for rules. I love a rule. I'm a big rule guy.</v>

387
00:21:32.701 --> 00:21:36.990
I hate these people that hold the doors on the subway. I like you,

388
00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:41.970
but I get it. If it were me, I wouldn't call in the cops.

389
00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.790
Cause I'm not a, I'm not a. I'm not a rat, but I get it.

390
00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.370
I get the thing of like, why does this guy get to do this?

391
00:21:47.371 --> 00:21:51.120
Can I put my couch on the thing? That kind of thing. I hear you. I hear you.

392
00:21:51.121 --> 00:21:51.954
Well.

393
00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.260
<v 0>Case in point, I don't even know what that means,</v>

394
00:21:55.530 --> 00:22:00.450
but a fellow two's gay said I got a garage in Queens.

395
00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:04.140
Winter's coming up store the nuts, like the grasshopper,

396
00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:08.100
put the hog in for the winter and live a carefree life.

397
00:22:08.101 --> 00:22:11.340
So I'm taking him up on that. And thank you, sir, for the, for the garage.
