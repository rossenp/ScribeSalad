00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.720
<v 0>So welcome here into the, in the studio. It's good to have you here.</v>

2
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.330
<v 1>It's a, it's a pleasure. I'm a little hung over a little gay, but uh,</v>

3
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.600
just glad to be here with you, sister.

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.530
<v 0>I appreciate you saying that. I'm very happy to be here with you too.</v>

5
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.330
<v 1>It's hurting my erection, but, uh, yeah,</v>

6
00:00:20.331 --> 00:00:24.830
this is great fan of the gals, uh, which is weird because when I was a kid,

7
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.070
I hated girls. When I was like six years old. I thought girls were gross.

8
00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:31.310
I thought they were dumb. I know you're allowed to hate girls as a kid,

9
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.280
but that's why the only group a kids allowed to hate,

10
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.900
because if I was a six year old, that hated Puerto Rican's.

11
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.930
That would be weird, you know? But I was like, Hey mom, I hate Puerto Rican.

12
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.840
She would never say, Oh, you'll like them one day.

13
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.981
<v 0>Well,</v>

14
00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:52.100
one thing that I've been able to kind of pick up as you do have that old self

15
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.870
deprecating humor, which I do enjoy in a comedian, hate myself.

16
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.890
<v 1>I'm always drawn to people that hate me, I guess,</v>

17
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.780
because we have so much in common, but I'm not good with the small talk,

18
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.110
you know, two things I can't do small talk and eye contact. How sad is that?

19
00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:09.944
You know,

20
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.010
I basically have all the traits of a serial killer just without the ambition.

21
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.050
I'm working on it though. I'm working on it. You know, people are saying to me,

22
00:01:18.051 --> 00:01:21.290
Mark, gotta be more confident. And they say, Mark, gotta be yourself. I'm like,

23
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.830
wow. Yeah,

24
00:01:24.831 --> 00:01:26.950
I've been following it up in the green room. And uh.

25
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.630
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.890
<v 1>A little smaller green room. Exactly. We call it. Hotboxing</v>

27
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.860
really soaking it all in.

28
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.310
Cause it's the smell of your own forks for some reason is enjoyable.

29
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.520
If you forwarded it to be weird. But if I fart, I enjoy, I don't know.

30
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.750
<v 0>Guy thing you would hear,</v>

31
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.240
no woman would ever say something like that.

32
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.340
<v 1>No, you guys are more of a, maybe a query thing. Oh my gosh. All right. Hey,</v>

33
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.610
any Puerto Rican's here, right?

34
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.920
[inaudible] Puerto Rican's good people. Good people. A very passionate people,

35
00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:14.570
a lot of knives, but passionate. Very fast. Hey, I'm just telling jokes.

36
00:02:14.571 --> 00:02:17.690
I'm a comedian look, look, I live in New York city. All right. If I was racist,

37
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.040
I would be exhausted. So you grew up in new Orleans.

38
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.990
Oh yeah. Good times. Weird city. I always see new Orleans, great place to visit.

39
00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:30.830
Not a great place to grow up. It's kind of like a dad who sells drugs,

40
00:02:30.831 --> 00:02:34.430
but doesn't hug you. You know what I mean? You get the fun stuff,

41
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.780
but you don't get a ride to school.

42
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.080
<v 0>I never think of it like that.</v>

43
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.890
<v 1>She works at a gay bar, so I'll go there from time to time, get a free drink.</v>

44
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.753
Maybe a compliment.

45
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.080
My guy friends are blown away by this. They're like, dude, you go to gay bars.

46
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.680
That is weird. If some gay guy ever hit on me,

47
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.930
I don't know what I would do.

48
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.330
How about you just not have sex?

49
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.110
Pretty easy, sir. How do you feel about gay marriage getting past

50
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.200
that gay porn? Good Lord. You're a, you're a big fan.

51
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.480
Ma'am how do you feel about gay marriage getting past

52
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.770
bigots? I'm not racist. I look at racism the same way I look at Nickelback.

53
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.880
Yeah. It's fun to joke about, but uh, you never want to see.

54
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:30.540
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

55
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.760
<v 0>So, but we're big. I mean you're young.</v>

56
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.350
So getting into this business and getting into this business

57
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.110
and um.

58
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.830
<v 1>35, 35, not that young, but uh, you know, not on the Viagra yet.</v>

59
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.530
<v 0>Or.</v>

60
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.610
<v 1>Am I, who knows? I like to snort it.</v>

61
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.630
I think my weirdness is hurt me with the, with the gales.

62
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.440
I'm seeing somebody now, but, uh, boy, I was a bad dater. I, uh,

63
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.680
I went on a blind date once. Right? When the girls saw me, she goes, Hey, I bet,

64
00:04:04.681 --> 00:04:08.250
whatever really cute kids. I was like, all right, I bet we'd have great sex.

65
00:04:08.251 --> 00:04:12.690
And she goes, Whoa, slow down. I was like,

66
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.850
I was like, slow down. You're nine months ahead of me. But Hey,

67
00:04:17.851 --> 00:04:20.220
that's why I'm a comedian because I got to get love.

68
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.620
<v 0>Somewhere. Oops. Sorry.</v>

69
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.900
<v 1>Is that a me too? All right.</v>

70
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.260
I, uh, I drank too much. I, um, actually got, let,

71
00:04:31.261 --> 00:04:35.250
go from a job for being drunk at work. Yeah. My boss called me and he goes,

72
00:04:35.251 --> 00:04:40.230
get in here, Mark. It's clear. You're a high functioning alcoholic. I was like,

73
00:04:40.231 --> 00:04:45.120
wow. How do you know? I was also high? I nor lady approached me.

74
00:04:45.121 --> 00:04:47.940
Once she goes, Oh, I'm going to kidnap you. I was like, wow.

75
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.500
I could never say that to a woman. I sent it to a lady. She calls the police.

76
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.930
I would be curious to know what a woman can say. That would offend me like,

77
00:04:54.931 --> 00:04:56.790
all right, I'm going to take you home drug.

78
00:04:56.791 --> 00:04:59.730
You take advantage of you and film it. I'd be like, all right,

79
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.990
well at least let me pay for the Uber

80
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.590
I a single guy back on the scene. All right.

81
00:05:07.591 --> 00:05:12.570
Prove it. Cat. Call us ladies. That'd be hilarious.

82
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.181
You know,

83
00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:18.060
start yelling stuff at us that we don't want to hear stuff that would scare a

84
00:05:18.061 --> 00:05:21.270
guy. You know, you walk past a group of girls at night when I was like, Hey,

85
00:05:21.271 --> 00:05:23.790
I'll tell you, I love you on the first day. You're like, Holy hell.

86
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.340
That is terrifying. Yeah. Get us back. You know, you walk past a girl.

87
00:05:29.341 --> 00:05:31.620
She's like, Hey, before we have sex, I'm gonna poke a hole in the condom.

88
00:05:31.621 --> 00:05:34.670
This is a horrible, like I was on the subway resale.

89
00:05:34.671 --> 00:05:38.100
I was watching interracial couple make-out. I was just staring at him

90
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.640
and the guy next to them caught me. He goes, what the hell?

91
00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:45.090
I see you staring at them. What are you racist? I was like, what? Racist? No,

92
00:05:45.091 --> 00:05:49.860
I'm a creep. What are you talking about? I'm hard.

93
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.120
You're going to be here. I, uh, I Ubered here. That was,

94
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.430
I had a real chatty driver. Oh,

95
00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.100
I hate would it be nice if there was a small talk option on the app, you know,

96
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.490
but there isn't. So you got to really find your own way to quiet the guy.

97
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:06.860
I like to scare him and I he's like, Hey, I bought this traffic.

98
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:09.470
What do you think is causing this? I'm like probably the Jews. He's like,

99
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.560
all right, nice, quiet ride.

100
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.670
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>
