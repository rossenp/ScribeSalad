00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.350
<v 0>But yeah, we've come a long way.</v>

2
00:00:01.351 --> 00:00:03.990
We hate to admit that we hate to admit it we've come a long way.

3
00:00:03.991 --> 00:00:06.690
Like in the fifties, we had whites only, and blacks only water fountain,

4
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.210
which is incredibly sad, especially if you're a thirsty Asian.

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.970
<v 1>What the hell are they?</v>

6
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.910
<v 0>They're doing drinking out of a faucet. No one talks about it.</v>

7
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.240
Never come up once. Not a peep, not the black pillar. Can you believe this?

8
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.850
We got our own water phone age. Like, can I get a sip? I'm dying.

9
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.510
<v 1>I got a triangular hat to block the sun.</v>

10
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.100
<v 0>Big fan of Asians. I think they're the best group. I think they're number one.</v>

11
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.440
I don't think they get the credit. They deserve that.

12
00:00:33.441 --> 00:00:35.120
I'm an Asian supremacist all the way.

13
00:00:35.121 --> 00:00:39.770
I think they're better than the rest of any Asian people here. Hey, all right.

14
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.540
You should be working. God. What are you doing? Having a good time.

15
00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:45.980
That's not the Asian. I know.

16
00:00:45.981 --> 00:00:49.790
God what I want you to dealing black Jack or sitting on a box. Peeling,

17
00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:54.680
something Big fan, best group.

18
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.100
Easily. The best group. No love you guys. Get the short on the chopstick.

19
00:00:58.101 --> 00:01:02.780
It's pretty unfair. So quiet. So secure Asians, every other,

20
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.840
group's got a brag and boast. Every group's got a slogan, black people.

21
00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:08.720
I'm black and I'm proud. White people, white power, Hispanics,

22
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.660
Not an Asian and just head down grades up. That's.

23
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.060
<v 1>It. Angel.</v>

24
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.210
<v 0>The bet. You never hear about Asian crime. Never. If I was an Asian guy,</v>

25
00:01:20.211 --> 00:01:22.790
I would just start bugging people. I'm like, Hey, it's my word against yours?

26
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:25.640
<v 1>Big fan.</v>
