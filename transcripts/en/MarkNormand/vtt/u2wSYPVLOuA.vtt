00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.230
<v 0>That's the weirdest thing about comedy. It can work one night and not the next.</v>

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.580
And you're like just the same wording, same delivery guy. But Hey.

Cause I'm already here and show's happening in 10 seconds, but, uh, yeah,

7
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.710
we're gonna try some new jokes. Try them out on Twitter or something like that.

8
00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:49.040
Okay. And then we've got two shows a night, so we'll try it on the first show.

9
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.830
See what happens, tweak. Try it on the second show.

10
00:00:51.831 --> 00:00:54.290
And if you want to go back tomorrow, that'll be a couple more shows,

11
00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:57.380

19
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.910

Now we're doing Friday late show this show Friday Lake show.

27
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.350
Typically not always, typically a little more tired,

28
00:02:45.351 --> 00:02:48.710
a little boozier they've been day drinking or they've been, uh,

29
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.710
boozing at dinner and then they come to a 10 o'clock show.

30
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.750
This one could be a little dicey. Uh, so we'll see what happens.

31
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:00.763
<v 1>[Inaudible]</v>

32
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.610
I appreciate it.

33
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.320
These are weird times, you know, let's be honest.

34
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.780
I can't believe we're all here. Some guy up bad

35
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.480
schools are closed. You know what sucks with the parents? Great for me though,

36
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.950
because now I can drive again. Yeah.

37
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.180
All things crazy. I made it. What are we? Six months in now?

38
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.650
Kronos started building the check engine light. At first it was scary.

39
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.060
Like, it. I gotta go to work. The news is a bummer. How about that?

40
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.670
He's cute. It's still a little, it's like a COVID Brown bone.

41
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.110
Every time I see him, like I only got six more weeks of pandemics.

42
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.330
Thanks for coming on. I know it's cold. Hey, good to see. I was at cocaine

43
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.390
[inaudible] I don't know. I just so sick of this stuff, you know,

44
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.830
starting to feel like a middle Eastern woman, an arranged marriage.

45
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.030
I do what I'm told or cover my face. And I say my opinion. I get yelled at

46
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.630
my on acid or is this breathing

47
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.263
real bricks

48
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.180

49
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.130
[inaudible] tonight. Show comedy central a good, a silver Honda is getting.

50
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.530
Sports are trying to come back. Sports are weird.

51
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.810
There's nobody in the seats watching a basketball game. The stands are empty.

52
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.210
Weird. It's eerie. I got an idea.

53
00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.290
All those braces badges are torn down. Put them

54
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.690
somewhere to go make the players play better a little bit. I'm like, you.

55
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.243
[inaudible] here.

56
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.960
[inaudible] let me say this. When I wrote those jokes for you,

57
00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:58.743
[inaudible]

58
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.000
kind of say I was way off. The second show was way better. They were hot.

59
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.600
I mean the new stuff work. The old stuff work. The ending was good.

60
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.280
I estimated wrong.

61
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.410
I assumed assumption is the mother of all anal. What is it? Uh,

62
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.740
have you assume you make an out of me and your dad, whatever it is,

63
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:25.010
but I was way off and they were hot and I loved him.

64
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.930
I every there and I'll never stop loud. You're the one.

65
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.030
Thank buddy. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thought he was a fan that turned out.

66
00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:39.380
He was brownie. No, thank you though.

67
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.700
Yeah. Thanks for coming. Give me a hunch shoe. Oh,

68
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.240
knows that my mom, but Hey, I was a Cub scout. I've been in a tent before

69
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.980
on the last show, but don't worry.

70
00:07:02.981 --> 00:07:04.930
I was a Cub scout and this isn't the first time I've been

71
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.350
[inaudible] here. We are Jersey Saturday night.

72
00:07:11.351 --> 00:07:14.260
Look at the heat lamps going that guy's hard.

73
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:23.920
[inaudible].

74
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.270
<v 0>A couple of people were just giving me the in the evil eye, you know, just like,</v>

75
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:33.180
and you want to be like this nuts? Well, normally there's nothing worse than,

76
00:07:33.181 --> 00:07:36.730
than a crowd going like this. Guy's not that good. And I'm like, it works.

77
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.600
I swear to God at work.

78
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:50.940
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

79
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:55.360
<v 0>Crowd is good. Like last night, I I'm not even thinking of my act.</v>

80
00:07:55.361 --> 00:07:57.790
I'm just like, it's almost like you're floating. You're just in it. It's like,

81
00:07:57.791 --> 00:08:00.580
you're surfing. Like I'm on the wave tonight. I can. I was,

82
00:08:00.581 --> 00:08:02.200
I felt like I was just paddling the whole time.

83
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.510
<v 1>They had to stop the shooting. Batman,</v>

84
00:08:04.511 --> 00:08:07.570
the Batman movie had to be stopped because Batman got to Rome,

85
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.810
which I'm not shocked by because the wrong part of his face is covered.

86
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:14.223
What can you do?

87
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.450
<v 2>We were talking a little bit yesterday. How? Like,</v>

88
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.490
you're not like a big laugh out loud kind of guy.

89
00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:19.990
Do you feel like when you're in the audience,

90
00:08:19.991 --> 00:08:21.820
do you like if it was an audience full of you.

91
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.750
<v 0>It would be horrible. And I, I I'm aware of that would be a lot of, uh,</v>

92
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:30.660
a bunch of marks going. Yes, yes. Which I get that guy.

93
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:34.570
If I'm that guy, other people gotta be that guy, but I don't get the anger.

94
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.470
You know? Like the, you know,

95
00:08:38.471 --> 00:08:42.730
it's almost like there are not happy to be out and I'm like, you came out.

96
00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:43.840
I didn't make you do this.

97
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.173
<v 1>Let's let it push.</v>

98
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.920
The show is worse. If you up tonight, we'll get there the right side to booklet.

99
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.390
[inaudible] you can smell the girls hair.

100
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:18.230
[inaudible].

101
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:21.380
<v 0>That's what you shoot a ball. It goes in the hoop. It counts outside.</v>

102
00:09:21.381 --> 00:09:25.370
Monday counts on Saturday counts in India, counts in Africa, counts in America.

103
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.120
That joke killed on Friday night. Both shows Saturday night,

104
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.830
nothing that's comedy.

105
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:04.220
<v 1>[Inaudible] I wish he was my mom. Let's go in and drink heavily.</v>

106
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:13.400
<v 0>Is it like necessary now? More than ever to have a camera guy doing comedy.</v>

107
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.160
Yeah. Look at this queen over here in the corner. Yeah.

108
00:10:16.161 --> 00:10:19.070
You guys got a black for, I mean, you gotta have your guy.
