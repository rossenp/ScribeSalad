Texas procedural.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.880
What happened was he got screwed 300 bucks.

24
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.210
God, that's the most expensive meal ever in my life. He was taken care of.

25
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.550
I know like for mimosas. So what do we do when we say something? No,

26
00:01:46.551 --> 00:01:48.620
you can't say anything. What are you going to do? Yell at him.

27
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.000
He said it was taken care of, but we go in there. He took care of us, I guess,

28
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:55.190
in a way, man,

29
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.970
I had, until I own the house. You're very welcome.

30
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.510
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

31
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.430
<v 1>Right. Come from, take care of it means it's on me talking about this guy again.</v>

32
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.990
The restaurant gun deal. He gypped us. It like, you know, I mean,

33
00:02:17.991 --> 00:02:19.630
he doesn't owe us anything. He doesn't know us.

34
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.430
And what can you do when the bill comes? You can't fight it. You can't go, Whoa.

35
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.290
He said, you're going to take care of it. And you got to pay it.

36
00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:28.820
He had us by the balls. It's a pretty good ruse. And he's a fan of yours.

37
00:02:28.821 --> 00:02:31.970
He probably knew that you weren't going to contest it. Oh,

38
00:02:31.971 --> 00:02:36.650
you're probably right. You want to fool around and have to fall.

39
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.270
<v 0>Yeah. So this guy, he said, he's a fan. He owns a restaurant.</v>

40
00:02:41.271 --> 00:02:44.360
He invites me to sit down. He said, it's all taken care of.

41
00:02:44.361 --> 00:02:48.650
Then we get a bill for 300 bucks. Can you believe that? That's brutal.

42
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:59.623
[inaudible].

43
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.570

44
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.280
I leave a note inside Dell. There'll be able to take care of you.

45
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.920

46
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.790

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.690
<v 1>Guess who I ran into? Who? Neil quit the guy from the restaurant. Yeah.</v>

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.570
Yeah. Invited us to a free brunch tomorrow.

51
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.070
I know. I know. I'm not falling for that again.

52
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.790
And he's not even going to be there. So he's going to leave a note.

53
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.230
The whole restaurant's notes.

54
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.330
I might go over there just to see if there's the dope.

55
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.000
I don't even need the meal anymore. I want the note.

56
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.150
Let's see if there's a note. I want to go back there.

57
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:03.360
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

58
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.530
<v 1>Sorry to bother you. I got a weird one for you. Sure. Neil is not here today.</v>

59
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.610
No.

60
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.560
He told me that he was going to leave a note for me or for you saying

61
00:04:13.561 --> 00:04:15.540
I get a free meal. I know for me,

62
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.200
I know for you saying I get a meal today.

63
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.400
Free brunch period. Anything like that? He didn't see a note for me.

64
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.300
I mean the whole place notes, a lot of notes.

65
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.960
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

66
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.200
<v 1>Oh, well I couldn't find anything. Do you know when Neil's coming back?</v>

67
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.510
