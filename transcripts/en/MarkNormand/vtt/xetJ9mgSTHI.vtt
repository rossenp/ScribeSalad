00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.610
<v 0>I think they're going to have a few bigger girls in this issue too</v>

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.320
bigger girl. Like a Latifa, no. Ashley Gray hammers in their home.

3
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.720
Ashley Gray. Oh, she's a real pig. I don't know what that is. I'm joking,

4
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:15.890
but he's at bigger girls.

5
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.530
I don't know who that is. I don't think she took that one. Well,

6
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.220
[inaudible] gray ham,

7
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.440
grain. Ham. She's a real pig. She's a

8
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.990
dude is not having it. [inaudible] Oh, she's beautiful.

9
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.240
Full figured gal. And she's a bit on the big side, but she's nice.

10
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.650
That's a little, a little he's nicely for me. Yeah. Yeah.

11
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.480
You can tell when you're slapped, but it rolls.

12
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.310
I can with you guys joking. I love to eat her out. My mom's calling me.

13
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.400
All right. Good for her going. Every guy you don't want every guy gone.

14
00:01:10.401 --> 00:01:13.830
Yeah. That's you know, that's, that's great. But see, I don't what,

15
00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:17.060
what bothers me is all right. We all have to accept this. Hey, she's hot. Yeah.

16
00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:20.390
Yeah. But if a guy was five, four comes in, everybody makes one of them,

17
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.470
you know, we gotta have it both ways. I got the five, four. It got,

18
00:01:23.471 --> 00:01:26.360
I can't get any love. Right.

19
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.610
Thanks for the support fellows. All right.

20
00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:34.880
So we got chunky gals that's we got to high five her,

21
00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:37.910
but how about the bald guy? Nothing. I, you know, where does it end?

22
00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:42.710
Let's see the 58 geezer. Yes.

23
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.420
I didn't see that coming at all. I liked it. I think it looks amazing. Oh,

24
00:01:50.421 --> 00:01:54.050
you're lying. The little chest freckles.

25
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.220
The face I was in with the face. I'll be honest with you.

26
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.440
I was just with a nice body, but then the, uh, you don't like the bond,

27
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.850
the pullout. I mean, it's, it looks like a lady to see it, the remodel pool.

28
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.230
I'm not going to, not against that.

29
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.640
To notice that they shot her at the end of the day, when the sun was going,

30
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.570
[inaudible] give me a dirty look. I'm not having it. I'm sorry, Nina.

31
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.900
I just don't know. Where does it end? Are we going to go wheelchair? You know,

32
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.620
there has to be some standard is all I'm saying all women are beautiful. Wow.

33
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.420
What I mean, come on. That doesn't make sense in different ways.

34
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.850
The definition of the word. Beautiful. It means there's only a few, you know,

35
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.450
sports. Hill's straight. I got to say, uh, the swimsuit issue is probably the,

36
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.160
the only magazine I, I still buy. Yeah, no, I'm serious.

37
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.750
It's probably the only one I still buy. Well, you can collect, you know, herb,

38
00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:53.000
I don't need to collect them. Right. I'll take

39
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.590
[inaudible]. I get that way with guns and ammo.

40
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.410
So I don't really get your jokes to be honest,

41
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:11.890
most bottles don't.
