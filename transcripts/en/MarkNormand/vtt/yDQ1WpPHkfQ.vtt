00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.810
<v 0>Oh, I've had some bad core. You mentioned corporates. Oh yeah. Did you do any?</v>

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.680
Yeah, I did one over the holidays. Cause I had like seven of them.

3
00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:09.660
They pay amazing. I'd wear tuxedo.

4
00:00:09.661 --> 00:00:14.580
I did a pharmaceutical awards and I just did my clean act act.

5
00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:16.350
I used to open for Seinfeld. Yeah.

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.340
And a lady got offended and it happened to be the CEO's wife.

7
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.780
Quave and then he bitched me out and they fired me. Yeah. I love it. Yeah.

8
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.470
But it's just disheartening it these jokes. I've worked on the tonight show.

9
00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:31.860
What do you want? I did a gig at the seller. This guy showed up and he goes,

10
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.380
I like your stuff. You're edgy. You're wrong?

11
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.130
Come do my a country club come roast my country club. So he's like,

12
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.400
he gave me a sheet of like all his employees and all their dirt.

13
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.600
And he's like really zing them. And I show up and I do the mic tap.

14
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:48.150
Hey everybody, I'm going to do some comedy and they go,

15
00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:52.080
he's going to roast everybody. Sit back. He's got a cigar and a suit. I go, Hey,

16
00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:55.860
bill. And bill stands up and I go, we all know you're on Coke. And Bill's like,

17
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.590
what? And his wife's like, Oh my God, you're supposed to be cleaning.

18
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.800
And the kids are crying and you know, Rob, we all know you're gay.

19
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:05.010
Just come out already. And this is all the he gave me. Yeah. The place,

20
00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:08.490
you know, the place is in a, in a, in a brouhaha. And I, the guy came back.

21
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.540
He said, get the hell out of here. True story. We're all backwards.

22
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:16.530
Priority-wise like, you make a Corona virus joke. Nobody cares.

23
00:01:16.531 --> 00:01:18.570
You make a Coby joke. And you're the devil.

24
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.920
But it's like way more people died with Corona. I'm not saying either one is,

25
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.940
these are all hack retards. The industry sucks.

26
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.350
The industry is a bunch of finance costs. They're all just wearing a suit. No,

27
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.690
you know, whatever. But they don't know anything about comedy.

28
00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:36.660
I know about comedy. I'm in the, I'm in the trenches. I'm in the clubs.

29
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.620
Like I hate that. And then they all go. I love Pryor. I love that guy.

30
00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:43.440
I love Carlin. Now you don't name me one bit.

31
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.880
You don't know anything about comedy. You're just,

32
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.750
you're just at work and you want to keep your gig and you want to seem like

33
00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:51.540
you're on the up and up. And you want to seem like you're, uh, you know,

34
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:53.700
evolved and in the, in, on the right side.

35
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.440
But you don't actually care about funny.

36
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.600
This is the first time I've seen you rattled by the way. I've never, you ever,

37
00:01:57.601 --> 00:01:59.970
you're usually cool. As a cucumber, you look a little,

38
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.680
it's so entitled and narcissist and they can't even see outside their own. God,

39
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.130
God, sorry. I get it, man.

40
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.260
My friend from Whitman mass Joe list, we have a pug.

41
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.330
I love to watch him master Bach. God, my dream. Ooh, he's a, he's a hunk.

42
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.130
Him and his wife. Wouldn't you love to watch them. Yeah, answer freaky too, man.

43
00:02:23.131 --> 00:02:26.220
They said if an ant was our size, it would be faster than a Ferrari.

44
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.110
I find that odd. You have a goat.

45
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.183
<v 1>Wow.</v>

46
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.880
<v 0>The speed is cool. But this car looks silly to.</v>

47
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.713
<v 1>Me.</v>

48
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.350
<v 0>And over the top, I don't know it's to me, this is not safe.</v>

49
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.150
<v 1>Yeah. This is like a joke to me. You're not wrong, but you. I don't care.</v>

50
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.410
Retarded.
