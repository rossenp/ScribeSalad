00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.090
<v 0>Hey guys, we're back. What's going on. And if you, uh, if you, uh,</v>

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.080
listen to the commercials, thanks so much, man. Could you help me back it up?

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.210
You know what I mean? No dunce anyway.

4
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:10.783
<v 1>Uh.</v>

5
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.610
<v 0>No dance dude. No dance, right?</v>

6
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.620
Insecure. So, um,

7
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.280
this is a trailer of a real movie called drunk parents.

8
00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:26.840
Now I have not seen this trailer. I just know it's a movie. Why?

9
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.830
Because I travel on an airplane a lot of the time and every now and then you'll

10
00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:31.664
look at the.

11
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.800
When you travel on an airplane and you see the movies that are sometimes,

12
00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:37.221
you're like, Oh,

13
00:00:37.221 --> 00:00:41.990
did they make these movies sincerely just for American airlines. Right?

14
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.900
That's what this is like. There's movies called drunk parents.

15
00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:47.270
It's with Alec Baldwin and some highlights.

16
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.890
Now what all I can say is of course it's with them in it. Now. I like Alibaba.

17
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.620
When I'm, you know, I want to say, he's my buddy,

18
00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:58.160
but I've done his show a few times. You know, I run into him. He's a good guy,

19
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.240
but this movie seems hilarious. I haven't looked at it yet.

20
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.390
I'm looking at it for the first time. So I don't know if we're going to have,

21
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.500
you know.

22
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.040
<v 1>Wow. Cut out college girl. We're just a phone call away.</v>

23
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.000
I love you guys so much. Thank you for everything.

24
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.100
Can I help you? I'm just doing my job. I just need a little more time.

25
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.120
Why don't we find a way to put some new lawsuits, sell some crap, Robin.

26
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.320
<v 0>That's what's his day. Ma this is so boring so far.</v>

27
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.090
I can't even believe that this is something to sell something. What is this kid?

28
00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:36.110
Cuddy. Isn't a kid. Cudi. Cudi. I don't know.

29
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.110
<v 1>My nickname. Salesforce crap. Robin. Why?</v>

30
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.440
<v 0>Sound sounds so bad. It's because it was, you know, I mean, if this,</v>

31
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.470
if this was made anywhere, but Vancouver I'll straight up,

32
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.910
Rick rip one of my balls off. Oh, wow. I'll tell you why. It sounds so bad.

33
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.180
Okay. Nobody gives a. Oh yeah.

34
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.750
Nobody that made that movie gives a about anything. Sound guy goes like this.

35
00:01:56.751 --> 00:01:58.400
They go like this. Did we get it? Sound? That goes like this?

36
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.860
<v 1>Yeah, we got it. Let's go. Totally. Yeah. Oh yeah. We got it.</v>

37
00:02:03.861 --> 00:02:07.040
We about got it. That's what he said. Cause he's from Vancouver. Yeah. Break.

38
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.510
<v 0>Alec Baldwin. Ever not wear that coat in a movie by the way. No,</v>

39
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.280
it's always a gray double breasted with gloves.

40
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.670
I sorta got to be August in new Orleans. He's still wearing it finally.

41
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.180
<v 1>Yeah. It was your money. I miss Donna's accountant. That was MasterCard.</v>

42
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.970
Is this what the is this? What did he say?

43
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.860
I don't know. I don't know what the.

44
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.550
<v 0>How is this? The beginning of a trailer. Okay. Okay. Okay. So,</v>

45
00:02:37.551 --> 00:02:39.260
so far what happened? Let's break down what happened.

46
00:02:39.261 --> 00:02:42.590
So of course sweeping shot. So Vancouver. Okay. Yeah.

47
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.870
<v 1>So she's.</v>

48
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:45.141
<v 0>Going to call her,</v>

49
00:02:45.141 --> 00:02:49.100
she's going to college they're together and they're leaving her to college and

50
00:02:49.101 --> 00:02:50.840
he's wearing the coat. Okay.

51
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.390
So we're going go to every stirring the coat and she's always dressed for a

52
00:02:53.391 --> 00:02:55.850
funeral for some reason. Right? Okay. So yeah.

53
00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.220
<v 1>Phone call away. I love you guys so much. And college kid, the interesting.</v>

54
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.190
<v 0>About the college cages. She's 34, right? So that's all good. Yeah.</v>

55
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.053
So let's do this.

56
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:05.860
<v 1>Thank you for everything.</v>

57
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.430
<v 0>That was by the way,</v>

58
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.920
no humor or anything really in that, just, just exposition in a trailer,

59
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:16.420
which is crazy without that terrible music,

60
00:03:16.421 --> 00:03:19.480
you would actually have no idea was supposed to be a comedy. Okay.

61
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.000
<v 1>Can I help him? I'm just doing my job. I just need a little more time.</v>

62
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.000
Why don't you find a way to put some new lawsuit? Salesforce, Brett, Robin,

63
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.120
finally a break.

64
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.870
<v 0>Okay. So he's car gets towed. Why? I don't know.</v>

65
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.870
He says I need a little bit more time. Right?

66
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.520
We don't know what that means for the car.

67
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.220
We don't know what that means for the movie at all.

68
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.330
And you definitely don't know what it means in relation to college or daughter

69
00:03:45.331 --> 00:03:48.390
leaving a hundred percent. Okay. So, so, okay. So here we go.

70
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.970
Yeah. It was your money. Okay. Now he's talking on a phone,

71
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.170
but let's just go with an accent.

72
00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:57.443
<v 1>That was MasterCard.</v>

73
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.770
<v 0>Yeah. He was talking in an, in a phone,</v>

74
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.580
on an act with an accent and his wife was watching him and she's still dressed

75
00:04:05.581 --> 00:04:09.600
for a funeral. And how much did the dirt, by the way, he still has the jacket.

76
00:04:09.601 --> 00:04:13.020
How much did the director beg him? Not to do the accent. And he said, okay.

77
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.870
And then did it like that every single time? Yeah. Oh, I won't do it. Oh,

78
00:04:15.871 --> 00:04:18.330
you want me to, as a matter of fact, the director at the end,

79
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.430
he did nine takes under directors, like yeah. And he was like, uh, he was like,

80
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.940
did we get it? And then the director was like, sure. Cause you know, he's,

81
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.250
he's like, okay, he's not gonna do it. I told him not to do the accent. And I,

82
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.840
Bobby says, Oh wait, well, let's do one more.

83
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.330
Cause you said you wanted one without the accident. And there was a yeah.

84
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.060
And they said, and action. And he still did the accident. Okay.

85
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.500
So walked directly to his trailer. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So,

86
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.820
and then what does he say here? That was Mr. Kurt. That was,

87
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.830
that was MasterCard. MasterCard master. That was mastered Mr. Kirk. Okay.

88
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.580
<v 1>Papa daughter's accountant. That was MasterCard.</v>

89
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.780
<v 0>They're losing money. Okay. Going broke. They're going broke.</v>

90
00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.940
It's because it says they're going broke. Okay. I'm going.

91
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.370
<v 1>To Nigel's for a minute. Okay.</v>

92
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.070
<v 0>Now Nigel is for sure British, come on. Now he's going into a wine cellar.</v>

93
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.790
<v 1>$800. Who's supposed to be looking after his property,</v>

94
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.950
rent that out right out of his house. Rent house.

95
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.840
Nigel's house. That's the same.

96
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.250
There was a rental ad for this house on Craigslist.

97
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.620
<v 0>Again, that's Jim Gaffigan.</v>

98
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.100
<v 1>I think he was sent from God as the new neighbor.</v>

99
00:05:26.101 --> 00:05:30.720
I'm legally required to tell you that I'm a registered sex

100
00:05:30.721 --> 00:05:31.554
offender.

101
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.480
<v 0>That's funny. I actually think that's funny. I think African's funny. Uh,</v>

102
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.640
very weird. Very weird to go in this trailer.

103
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.080
Absolutely weird. Absolutely weird. The most benign trailer so far.

104
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.940
And now all of a sudden this guy's like I'm a sex offender, a new guy the only,

105
00:05:50.941 --> 00:05:55.560
okay. Okay. So, and I'm not, I love golf again.

106
00:05:55.561 --> 00:05:59.210
He's funny. This is my favorite part of the trailer Abloh site. Okay.

107
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.180
<v 1>Sex offender come again. Wow. Really.</v>

108
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.900
<v 0>Pretty funny actually. Okay. As jokes go, he says, come again. That was funny.</v>

109
00:06:10.901 --> 00:06:15.820
Funny delivery. Alec Baldwin. Yeah. Paul was funny. He's funny. Yeah. Um, okay.

110
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.140
<v 1>We gotta report a suspicious activity. Nigel.</v>

111
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.640
How's it going over there in London? Huh?

112
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.680
I just had a conversation with the police. We're going to jail.

113
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.410
We gotta get outta here. Just take what you need for the next few weeks.

114
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.620
<v 0>So I don't know. I'm lost.</v>

115
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.430
So the renting the house out or no, there,

116
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.190
there are they're any the house that's Nigel's house. Yeah.

117
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.170
And Nigel is away is getting because he's away. And he heard the cops,

118
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.360
cops called him because something happened. Yes.

119
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.640
And they're renting out Nigel's house. Yes. So far has,

120
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.360
has nothing to do with drinking. Yeah.

121
00:06:52.361 --> 00:06:55.120
It's not parenting drunk parents know or parenting. Yeah.

122
00:06:55.121 --> 00:06:58.210
The kid goes away at college. Still. The movies should be called Nigel's house.

123
00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.490
Yeah. So yeah. Well actually the,

124
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.550
probably the main problem I have with that is it shouldn't be called drunk

125
00:07:03.551 --> 00:07:08.460
parents. I don't like titles like that. Right. It's like, it's just a blanket,

126
00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:11.680
like bad teacher. Yeah. Yeah. Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay. Cool.

127
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.840
<v 1>Dad, I'll go. Frank and aunt Nancy are here. You two are welcome.</v>

128
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:17.800

<v 0>Joe Minaj or whatever the. The hot guy. The haka is in it. The hot guy. Yeah.</v>

130
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:28.450
The workout guy. Yeah. He was the hottest guy. What is up with this?

131
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.780
I get mistaken for him all the time. With what? D yeah.

132
00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.500
What's the deal with this

133
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.980
movie? I don't D I mean, I have,

134
00:07:38.981 --> 00:07:42.970
was it suppose it was definitely supposed to come out in the theaters. Yeah.

135
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.450
Alec Baldwin, Selma Hyatt, Jomo men, Juliano

136
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:52.000
mangenta yellow. I think. Um, uh, I mean,

137
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:56.290
kid Cuddy has a cameo. I'm sure. He's the cameo guy. And then the other guy,

138
00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.160
Jim, Gaffigan's in it too. Yeah. These are big, big acts.

139
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.790
It doesn't look cheap either. It doesn't not don't think so. I mean,

140
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.300
it can't really be that cheap, but those people in it for true.

141
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:12.580
<v 1>Hilarious, like Frank and I can overcome anything.</v>

142
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:14.980
As long as we have to get

143
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:22.180
your mother to seems a little unhinged,

144
00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:27.603
keep it close.

145
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:32.050
<v 0>Those guys have booked those guys right there. I'm telling you right now.</v>

146
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.730
I don't know this. Never seen him before.

147
00:08:33.731 --> 00:08:36.880
I'm telling you they've booked over 110 commercials. I mean,

148
00:08:36.881 --> 00:08:38.080
look at those two guys.

149
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.530
Those guys have done so many commercials where they go like this. Um, yeah.

150
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:47.410
They make the face. Yeah. Yeah. Have you talked about the face? No.

151
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.570
You should talk about the, we'll talk about the face after this.

152
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:51.003
<v 1>That's fine.</v>

153
00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.900
Stop the truck. Wayne, throw a rocket.

154
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.320
You probably caught him all it.

155
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:20.610
How are you? I'm on the right side of the grasp of man.

156
00:09:20.611 --> 00:09:21.444
What's the Habs.

157
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.910
<v 0>What is it called? They're not even drinking in it.</v>

158
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:29.540
What's the hats that made me mad when he said it

159
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.240
don't like that at all. You don't like that. Why not? Butters? Isn't in sell.

160
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.193
Why don't you like that?

161
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:40.400
I just not into like ending the trailer on what's ending it on that as bad yet.

162
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:45.230
It's not good. Yeah. Uh, yeah. They're not drinking once in that. No,

163
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.210
not even a little bit. So that's a weird thing.

164
00:09:47.211 --> 00:09:51.860
They might as well call it the avatar six or some. It's not that either. Um,

165
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:56.780
so anyway, uh, the face, yeah. You haven't talked about no,

166
00:09:56.781 --> 00:10:01.490
I haven't actually it's um, every, every, uh,

167
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:05.870
movie poster has this face on it. Every comedy has his face on it. Yeah.

168
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:11.600
It's like this, right. It's and it's 99% of the time. It's a guy.

169
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.290
Yeah. It's also girls now it's equal. You know what I mean?

170
00:10:15.291 --> 00:10:16.290
Now there's 2019 girls.

171
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:19.610
Now you're making me sound sexist when it comes to the face. But every comedy,

172
00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.820
but look up anyone, look up. Any comedy posters, look up. Anyone with Tim Allen,

173
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:27.200
especially sitcoms TV. Comedy is the most, most like,

174
00:10:27.201 --> 00:10:31.220
look at this situation I'm in right now. How I got myself into hi-jinks. Right,

175
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:35.120
right. Catch you later. They all do. And all do an immersion.

176
00:10:35.121 --> 00:10:37.160
Those guys are doing that awkward moment.

177
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:43.670
Knocked up. Look at the knocked up one. That's I mean, he's stand up,

178
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:47.630
scroll up there. There you go. That's the face to a tee. You almost got some,

179
00:10:47.631 --> 00:10:50.570
I just know. Cause he wasn't scrolling up and I want him to scroll up to it.

180
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:55.400
Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah. That's the most. Yeah. I don't know what it is.

181
00:10:55.401 --> 00:10:57.260
It's you know what it is? Cause I've done sitcoms and.

182
00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.250
It's hard to not do the face. And if you do it once they got it,

183
00:11:01.251 --> 00:11:03.950
that's the one they're gonna use. I look at, Oh, look it.

184
00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.300
You're good to go to bed. Go to your, go, go,

185
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.040
go back to the one you just said good. The Justin Timberlake. I'm getting past,

186
00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:12.320
I'm getting. Go back to Justin Timberlake one. You just had. Wow. Just go back.

187
00:11:12.321 --> 00:11:16.850
And I'm friends with benefits, dude, Justin Timberlake.

188
00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.630
Right now the thing is Justin Timberlake is just making the face because he's a

189
00:11:20.631 --> 00:11:23.990
singer and he's like, Oh, this is the face that actors do. Yeah. What,

190
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:28.790
but that's the thing though. People, uh, people, uh,

191
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.150
like when you're shooting the for the stuff,

192
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.570
cause they did it for the sitcom and they were like, Hey, you know, what's up,

193
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.720
what's up now? How'd you get yourself in this position? Like, they'll do that.

194
00:11:37.721 --> 00:11:40.340
And you'd be like, I don't know. And then, and you're like. And then you're.

195
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:43.820
Yeah. So anyway, go see drunk parents.

196
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.640
All you have to do is take a flight somewhere. You can't. Yeah.

197
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:50.720
There's nowhere to see it. Yeah. Uh, that reminds me of that movie.

198
00:11:50.721 --> 00:11:52.820
I did a fake, totally worse than death though.

199
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:55.060
That's why I say it's in Vancouver. Oh wow.

200
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:58.810
The other day was an Aaron and then yes, Aaron. Paul was in it.

201
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:02.920
That's how we became friends. Anyway. That's what, that's what it is

202
00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.320
to take another break. Let's take another break. Okay.

203
00:12:08.321 --> 00:12:09.160
And then we'll be right back.
