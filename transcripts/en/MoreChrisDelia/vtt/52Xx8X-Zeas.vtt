00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.810
<v 0>Um, so, uh, yeah. Remember this though.</v>

2
00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:06.780
I wanted to talk cause we love this video. I think I know what's coming.

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.260
This is Quentin Tarantino stops the camera man.

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.950
God. How much does he, okay. Yeah.

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.560
How much does he deeply regret and is like, after he does it is like,

6
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.890
Oh no. Okay. I gotta watch it. I forget it. I haven't seen it. So.

7
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.500
<v 1>What's going on here? How's it going, man? How are you? What's going on here?</v>

8
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.680
No, what's going on here? What are you doing? What are you doing?

9
00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:38.090
Can you talk to me just for, just for the, what are you doing?

10
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.800
It don't move on. Don't do that again.

11
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.600
Kicking on that rule was actually, huh?

12
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.270
How'd you get so far and understand how he gets so far. Go for it. Go for it.

13
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.790
Go, go, go. So scared that it's on camera. Go hit me. Boom.

14
00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.830
You started on starting it. Yeah. Are you Ooh, so you know,

15
00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:04.040
she's not just a guy from Rhonda. You're actually a paparazzi guy. Nah,

16
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.990
I can't do it once upon a time. Probably what?

17
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.240
I'd be working your up and down this tree. Yeah. There you go. You know what?

18
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.020
He's greatest film couldn't turn to has ever made. I'm sorry.

19
00:01:18.021 --> 00:01:21.050
He's the like she just is the.

20
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.300
Look at his jacket dude,

21
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.000
wearing that is already like you're the?

22
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.470
<v 0>Tell you something, man. I agree with everything that happened here.</v>

23
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.420
Where's it going? I don't know. Where did he come from? Where's it going?

24
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:39.140
Infinitely in Utah. Yeah. He's Sundance.

25
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.000
But also like where's he going there? Finger placement. Yeah.

26
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.120
Oh no it wasn't going on here. No, what what's going on here?

27
00:01:47.121 --> 00:01:50.930
Like he's magician. Yeah. Let me just, you know, he,

28
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.490
this is I'm happy that he slapped him. I don't, I don't think he slapped him.

29
00:01:55.491 --> 00:01:57.410
I think he slapped the camera. Yeah. I'm happy he did that.

30
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.260
He shouldn't slap the guy's face obviously. Um,

31
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.350
but you sh the guy shouldn't just be in his face doing of course.

32
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.120
I think that if a guy is in your face filming you. Yeah, it is.

33
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.820
It should be a rule. It is okay to slap the cameras out of the person.

34
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.880
It is your right American, right. To slap that out of you.

35
00:02:13.881 --> 00:02:17.420
You shouldn't ever physically assault someone, but I think it's okay.

36
00:02:17.421 --> 00:02:21.950
If a guy has a camera on somebody's face on, you know,

37
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.960
what's the word? What unsolicited. Yeah. If it's like, yeah, exactly.

38
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.390
And you're just, you have it. It's Oak,

39
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.710
you basically have signed this contract.

40
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.700
It's okay for me to get smacked at it. You know what I think it is.

41
00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:39.710
It's like they broken the contract.

42
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.930
Like people are constantly not knowing the rules.

43
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.100
And if you don't know the rules and you break the rule, like all bets are off,

44
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.000
right. I'm going to slap that out of your head. Right. And I hope it breaks,

45
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.380
you know, also, but in the video,

46
00:02:51.381 --> 00:02:56.000
how does the person get so far away when Quintin gets

47
00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:57.320
far, but he,

48
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.440
he slaps him and then suddenly there's like a football field between,

49
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.220
is there a cut? No, there's not a cut. Right? I mean,

50
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:06.320
unless they cut it afterwards, it's unbelieve. You have to watch this turn,

51
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.290
you know, stops the camera, man. If you're watching the video pockets,

52
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:12.760
you can see it. But he slaps the camera to the head hit.

53
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.730
And it's like, it's like, he's the flash.

54
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.800
All of a sudden he's 20 feet away. Yes. Yeah. It's really weird. Yeah.

55
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.090
Oh, it makes it way funnier. And then, and then

56
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.930
[inaudible] when he does that thing. It's Whoa, man. I know,

57
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.410
but I didn't look if you're here. I also such a good impression. Thank you.

58
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.310
Why the? You know what I'm doing, but so good. I, I,

59
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.670
I actually disagree with you that he feels bad.

60
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.450
I think he feels bad. He's like nervous. Cause it's on camera.

61
00:03:43.451 --> 00:03:46.570
He slapped somebody. I, I, I disagree with that too. I, well,

62
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:47.740
we talked about it after and you know,

63
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.390
I think what he's doing is coiling up as a snake

64
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.880
and, and I might have to do something else here. Oh, I think he's like, man,

65
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.080
right? I'm acting like cool. I'm going to lure him in and I'm going to,

66
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.190
cause I might, I might fight this guy. I think that's what he's doing.

67
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.830
I don't think that what you're saying is right by the tape again.

68
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.693
I appreciate you saying that.

69
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.490
<v 1>How's it going, man? How are you? What's going on here? What's going on here,</v>

70
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.790
but that down. What's going on here? What are you? What are you doing?

71
00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:18.930
Can you do, can you not talk to me?

72
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.430
What are you doing that again? That's what?

73
00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.720
The shower camera calls. But how was he that far away? He's so far he must ran.

74
00:04:30.721 --> 00:04:33.570
He must have ran hates me. Oh this is.

75
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.470
<v 0>It hit me. Yeah. that guy. But by the way, that should be in a court of law.</v>

76
00:04:37.471 --> 00:04:39.990
I was like, well, he said hit him. He asked us for it. Yeah.

77
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.390
I agree with that too. Yeah. That's a thing. So here we go.

78
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.853
<v 1>Go, go, go, go.</v>

79
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.970
<v 0>Snakes so much though, for real. Cause that's what a snake does. It's like,</v>

80
00:04:50.971 --> 00:04:54.030
okay, look, just come by. I'm just part of the Bush. That's what I'm doing.

81
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.260
<v 1>Part the Bush. Come on. But</v>

82
00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.990
yeah.

83
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.460
<v 0>That's what he's doing. I already hit him. I know. I understand.</v>

84
00:05:02.461 --> 00:05:04.500
But it was like a love, it was like a smack out of the thing.

85
00:05:04.501 --> 00:05:07.230
I'm going to choke the out of him and it's all good. I'm in a Bush.

86
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.350
<v 1>So you think he's like luring him in.</v>

87
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.660
<v 0>Oh, a hundred percent disagree, but I like yours better. So let's just go with,</v>

88
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.200
you know why I know he's coiling. No I don't because he sips his coffee.

89
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.610
There is no way. This is good. This,

90
00:05:22.611 --> 00:05:26.070
he would sip his coffee at this moment unless he was like, look,

91
00:05:26.071 --> 00:05:29.100
I'm just going to act natural. Everything's all I agree with that last bite.

92
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.430
I agree with that as well. But what I think is he's like,

93
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.190
I don't want this guy to like report. Yeah. And he's like,

94
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.710
no, you know, it's all fun. I'm so chill. I'm actually just going to sip.

95
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.050
I'm not even going to punch. I'm not going to kick. I'm gonna sip. And like,

96
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.680
now we can be, we can be like, yeah, no, I, I, I,

97
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.220
but you know, Quintin, Tarantino, you know how he thinks about things. Yeah. No,

98
00:05:58.221 --> 00:05:59.330
he hates this guy. Yeah.

99
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.650
And he thinks there's he thinks basically like I should be able to beat the out

100
00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:06.840
of this guy. Yeah. He should. I should beat this guy. He should. Yeah. And I,

101
00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.810
so I think that, I think that my way is right. It's also way funnier.

102
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.680
Well, here's the thing, whether you're right or not. Yeah. I like it's a better,

103
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.570
better. So I believe that now, like anything that can be better,

104
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.050
even if it's not true. That's the thing is now true.

105
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.540
<v 1>Can you not talk to me just for, just from the, what are you doing?</v>

106
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.370
Well, we got coffee right away.

107
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:37.533
<v 0>We'll do your coffee.</v>

108
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.010
<v 1>Go, go, go, go, go, go, go for</v>

109
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.880
the XL. Boom. You started on starting it. Yeah.

110
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.580
So she's not just a guy from Randy. You're actually a puffer. I see guy. Nah,

111
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.600
I can't do it. [inaudible] go ahead.

112
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.840
<v 0>Head swiveled to kind of do it. Yeah. I love that.</v>

113
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.120
It's going like this extra too. Yeah. Yeah. Sell it. He's selling it.

114
00:07:07.121 --> 00:07:10.600
This is the WWE. Yeah. He definitely is into that. Yeah.

115
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.650
<v 1>Yeah. You know, you can't do that unless you're filming. Yeah.</v>

116
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.130
But if that was up, I'd be whooping your up and down this side.

117
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.970
<v 0>The raddest thing anyone's ever done to say that,</v>

118
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:27.070
to get clarification and then be like, Oh right. Because if that were true,

119
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.250
I'd be whooping your up and down the street. And then to turn around,

120
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.740
walk away from a Starbucks.

121
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:38.140
I'll push the street with that puffy raccoon food jacket on where I paused it.

122
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.690
I paused it. Look, it looks like it.

123
00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:46.870
<v 1>Look at where I posted.</v>

124
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.820
<v 0>It. I'm a wild animal dude. Dude. He,</v>

125
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.490
yeah, because if that were off, if that camera was off, I'd be whipping,

126
00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.420
whooping, whooping your up and down this street. sad to say.

127
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.440
So he's a great writer. I was just going to say that. Yeah.

128
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:04.900
Does it start when we're ready to say it.

129
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.440
I've been in this situation in my head. 90, 15 million. Right, right, right.

130
00:08:08.441 --> 00:08:13.240
Yeah. So I sip the coffee. Okay. Delete, delete sips of coffee.

131
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:17.220
And here's the deal if it was off. Oh dude. God.

132
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:22.810
God. Yeah. He's funny. Oh, I love Tarantino. Do it.

133
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:27.460
He was at the comedy store once. Yeah. And I ate. Oh really? Yeah.

134
00:08:27.461 --> 00:08:29.780
It was so long ago. I was like, I want to go out for a quick, you know,

135
00:08:29.781 --> 00:08:33.580
maybe he'll put me in the next month. This is so long ago and I ate. Sorry.

136
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:37.030
Yeah. It's okay. I mean, I'm sure he doesn't even know who I am still,

137
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.780
but he was just like, yeah. You know, man, when you bond, he ain't.

138
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.280
And walked away with a big puffy jacket. That's all good. He ain't.

139
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:51.250
You shouldn't. Um, I mean I've seen that video 300 times. You know what I mean?

140
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.500
How many views does a video like that have not enough, whatever then. Yeah.

141
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.840
Cause that was one of those things that kind of went viral before people really

142
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:02.490
give a about viral stuff. It shouldn't be more know how many views does it have?

143
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:07.590
A four mil. Oh, that's a lot lots. A lot, dude. Wow.

144
00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:12.030
He's just a lot. I think he's doing some with Gerard Carmichael. Yeah. I think,

145
00:09:12.031 --> 00:09:15.750
I think, uh, like some, I think I read, I can't remember what it is,

146
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:19.710
but that's very cool. Yeah. He's yeah.

147
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.880
He's he's just saying I don't like his. I'm like. Yeah dude. Nah,

148
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:24.141
if that's the thing though,

149
00:09:24.141 --> 00:09:27.950
it's like one of those guys that I've never not liked one of his things,

150
00:09:27.951 --> 00:09:32.630
but I haven't seen all of the things. Right. But uh, I'm, I'm sure, you know,
