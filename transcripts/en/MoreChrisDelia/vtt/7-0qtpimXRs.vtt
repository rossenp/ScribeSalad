00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.000
<v 0>Um, man. It's cool. How I talk about all the real that's going on in the world?</v>

2
00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:08.950
Huh? Um, my, my, uh, my, my opener dude. This is, remember,

3
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.420
you know how I talk about my opener a lot and about how ding batty he is, bro.

4
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.170
This made me want to do rapid fire punches into his jock. Okay.

5
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.020
Burgers. Everyone knows burgers are amazing. Okay.

6
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.510
If you think burgers, aren't amazing,

7
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.550
then you got no brain and that's very obvious because burger here's the other

8
00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:32.440
thing too. I fully believe burgers are a snack.

9
00:00:32.441 --> 00:00:36.790
If you eat one burger and you're full, that's it, dude, you have a small tummy,

10
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.090
but that has got a big tummy. Okay. So when I eat one burger,

11
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.610
you know what I want immediately after another burger,

12
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.910
even if it has two patties on it, Hey, that doesn't help.

13
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.200
I want two burgers because a burger is a snack. Our burgers like having,

14
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.770
if you have one burger as like having some peanuts, if you have two burgers,

15
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.240
it's like a meal. Okay. Glad we figured it out.

16
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.170
End of discussion. Do not tweet me about it. Okay.

17
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.140
A burger is a snack Donesville

18
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.950
so if you eat one and that's it, you're a skunk. Now that's obvious.

19
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.010
I don't want any one burner. Okay.

20
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.480
<v 1>So, uh, my.</v>

21
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.580
<v 2>Opener is always like.</v>

22
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.190
<v 0>I'd rather go for the chicken sandwich now.</v>

23
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.290
Chicken sandwiches are great as well. However, I don't need, you know,

24
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.410
they're a little healthier. I feel like. So I'll eat chicken sandwiches mostly,

25
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.050
but of course I would always want a burger. And he was like, nah, burgers.

26
00:01:35.051 --> 00:01:37.870
Aren't aren't good. I don't like burgers. I'd rather get a sandwich or whatever.

27
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.610
And I'm like, well, you're crazy to it.

28
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.840
That's annoying that you pretend not to like burgers because burgers are so

29
00:01:43.841 --> 00:01:45.610
good. Do you know why? Cause burgers.

30
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:47.703
<v 1>So.</v>

31
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.140
<v 0>This did what, like a 16 year old chick would do.</v>

32
00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.300
Like I used to know this girl that lost her virginity in Italy and that me off

33
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.070
because she got swept up in the moment. Hey, Detroit, then go to Italy.

34
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.270
You what I'm talking about. It's so romantic to be.

35
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.520
<v 3>Like, well, when I was studying abroad,</v>

36
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.000
I met this guy and everyone called him Ella Capitano.

37
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.080
<v 0>And we had sex in his farmhouse and he took me on his scooter,</v>

38
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.310
Detroit, then study abroad.

39
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.610
Um, so anyway, this guy goes to Amsterdam because he's like, dude,

40
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:35.160
what else am I going to go to? Amsterdam? Okay, cool.

41
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.770
His buddy was out there and took a trip to Amsterdam. My opener.

42
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.620
McGlynn Nochi got to Amsterdam,

43
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.700
ate a burger in Amsterdam. All right, fine. He says,

44
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.560
it's the best burger he's ever had.

45
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.870
<v 1>Okay. Now anger level is rising.</v>

46
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:56.723
Okay.

47
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.110
<v 0>Cause we know burgers are very American and the best burgers are 100%</v>

48
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:06.490
of course in America. Here's the other thing, if you don't think burgers,

49
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.740
the best burgers are in America. They're definitely not.

50
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:13.960
<v 1>In Amsterdam.</v>

51
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.060
<v 0>Okay. So now I'm, but I'm listening right? That he's got an open mind.</v>

52
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.830
He tries to let his anger level subside. Okay. So he's talking and he says,

53
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.460
yeah, I had the best program ever had an Amsterdam and I go, that's ridiculous.

54
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:30.100
But I'm still trying to keep an open mind. And he says,

55
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.310
and I kept eating burgers in Amsterdam. And guess what?

56
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.330
The burgers in Amsterdam are way better than the burgers in America.

57
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.490
Now I sit back and I'm very angry. Of course. And I say.

58
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.460
<v 2>Say what you said again. And he says, all the burgers.</v>

59
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.100
<v 0>Are in Amsterdam. They really know how to do a burger.</v>

60
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.220
<v 1>And I said, oh my oh.</v>

61
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.370
<v 2>Dude, that's so annoying because here's why dude,</v>

62
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.320
you don't eat burgers in America because you say you don't like burgers.

63
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.910
Then in Amsterdam, you start eating burgers and you think, whoa,

64
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.600
these burgers are awesome. And they're better than the ones in America.

65
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.480
But really all you're doing,

66
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.380
dude is opening your mind to burgers.

67
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.960
You just started eating burgers and started liking burgers. Like I told you,

68
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.090
you like burgers. Like I said, dude, no mother.

69
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.740
You don't like Amsterdam burgers. You just like burgers.

70
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.920
Dude burgers are the. No matter where you go, dude, what are you talking about?

71
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.040
This guy's over in Amsterdam, eating burgers. Just like,

72
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.440
are you kidding me? This burger is rocket Amsterdam, dude,

73
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.050
man, get outta here with the,

74
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.720
eat burgers in America.

75
00:05:06.721 --> 00:05:10.230
Now he's not eating burgers in America because he thinks the burgers are good in

76
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.060
the Amsterdam due to what kind of lunatic lifestyle do you live in?

77
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.450
That's laughable, dude.

78
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.560
This guy's over in Amsterdam.

79
00:05:25.561 --> 00:05:30.150
Just thinking he figured some out, dude.

80
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.420
That's insane to me. I will never.

81
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.800
<v 0>Do that to you. I will never do that to you, mother.</v>

82
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.160
<v 2>I don't let my go nuts just because I'm in another country, dude.</v>

83
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.940
And you don't get swept up. Do it imagine being in Paris.

84
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.010
<v 3>And, and, and, and falling.</v>

85
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.970
<v 2>In love. Get the outta here. This is real life, dude.</v>

86
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.860
It ain't romantic. It's real life.

87
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.130
You still got to go to target and Costco and.

88
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.990
You're not Jerry Maguire. That movie ended early.

89
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.330
He got fat afterwards.

90
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:21.180
<v 0>Come on, dude. The romantic burgers in Amsterdam</v>

91
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.260
be you. That's what I'm saying. You need to come to a seminar for me.

92
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.680
Caroline Calloway. And I'll do it for free dude.

93
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.270
this Jared Leto thinking. He's got a cult. This is real life.

94
00:06:36.271 --> 00:06:37.860
We don't mention Jared Leto on this podcast.

95
00:06:37.861 --> 00:06:40.980
I've decided that actually I decided that today and I said his name and it's

96
00:06:40.981 --> 00:06:42.660
fine. And people are tweeting.

97
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.860
<v 2>Me all. Jared little really has a real call, dude, are you,</v>

98
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:47.720
this is a real call.

99
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:55.100
<v 0>And we get it and he stays drinking iced Americano.</v>
