00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.330
<v 0>And then what I, you know, what really bummed me out. I was thinking about this,</v>

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.100
th th th th this past week,

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.690
like I was thinking about high school, I was thinking about,

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.490
I was thinking all school, not just high school.

5
00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:13.200
I think about my elementary school. I was about high school.

6
00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:15.210
I was think about all the things that I've done in my life.

7
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.260
And I was thinking about them fondly. Like I was thinking about like,

8
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.190
mostly like how it was fun. And then I thought about how I,

9
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.650
how did I feel though, when it was happening?

10
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.480
And a lot of the time I felt not happy. I felt like,

11
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.350
like in high school, it's a very awkward time, you know, or you're growing up.

12
00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:38.610
You're like, Oh, I wasn't, I wasn't, you know, I didn't,

13
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.030
you didn't feel comfortable. You didn't feel whatever it was,

14
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:46.920
you felt out of place. And, uh, and I thought, well,

15
00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:51.900
that's interesting that now I look back on that fondly and it

16
00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:54.840
makes me happy to think about that time. When in actuality,

17
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.130
it wasn't necessarily, it wasn't necessarily the happiest of times. Right.

18
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.120
So I thought about how retrospect kind of like candy coats, everything.

19
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.480
And then I was thinking about all the things in my life

20
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.870
that I want to do, and I was getting excited for them,

21
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.090
you know, whatever it is, having a family doing my next, next, next, Netflix,

22
00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:22.560
special, um, you know, uh, uh,

23
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.130
whatever it is, lunch even tomorrow. Oh,

24
00:01:26.131 --> 00:01:29.130
I get to have a lunch tomorrow at the place I like, uh,

25
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.170
or I'm going to Las Vegas in three weeks.

26
00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:36.120
I can't wait to hang with my buddies and try to up jump the buggy, you know?

27
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.870
And I was ex and I was thinking about all the things I was excited about.

28
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:42.650
And then I was thinking about doing all of those things, like,

29
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.080
think about going to Vegas with your friends. Think about getting to do that.

30
00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:49.920
Think about if next week you and your buddies got to go to Las Vegas without

31
00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:52.260
your wife, without your girlfriends, or if you don't have one,

32
00:01:52.261 --> 00:01:52.891
it doesn't matter.

33
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:57.150
Maybe you going to go plucking and up jump the boogie with your friends. Okay.

34
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.210
You'd be so excited.

35
00:02:00.211 --> 00:02:03.960
Wouldn't you you'd be so excited to just go let off some steam. Now,

36
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.480
what we know is if you're over 30.

37
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.450
<v 1>It.</v>

38
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.180
<v 0>Wouldn't be as good as you made it out. What you thought it was going to be,</v>

39
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.300
because that's what happens. You go. Yeah, let's do this.

40
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.840
And you go and you get to the club in Vegas or whatever it is. And you're like,

41
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.510
Oh, it's okay. We go to the strip club and you're like, Oh, I thought it was,

42
00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:23.580
maybe it was going to meet a chick.

43
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:25.830
And maybe I was going to start dating a stripper and it didn't happen.

44
00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:28.860
You let your fantasy go run wild, but that's what keeps you going.

45
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.780
<v 1>Hell my point is,</v>

46
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.880
is it's never as good as you.

47
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.750
<v 0>You think it's going to be and retrospect, candy coats, everything.</v>

48
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.700
<v 1>So that means the worst time is</v>

49
00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:51.200
now. That sucks.

50
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.083
Dude. If,

51
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.560
if looking back on things that weren't necessarily good,

52
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.250
make it better. And if you're excited for something,

53
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:05.230
that's not going to be as exciting as you.

54
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.990
<v 0>Think it is, then the worst.</v>

55
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.630
<v 1>Time is now.</v>

56
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.640
And that's all you ever have now

57
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.360
we're. Say, Oh good. We're.

58
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.970
Let's all live in it together. It sucks the most.

59
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.863
Now

60
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.760
it sucks the most. Now I can't, I can't stop it.

61
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.280
I can't, I can't even stop it. I'm.

62
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.180
Yes. I always want the thing to be a kill switch. And it's not.

63
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.260
Yes.

64
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.060
I was wanting to start something when I hit the key and then have it be a kill

65
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:59.950
switch. Yes. And it never is. It just starts to fall over when the summer,

66
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:04.060
again, be much funnier to cut it out.

67
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.340
But when fire does a set up that way, I always talk to him.

68
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.170
boy. Yes.

69
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.070
<v 0>Um, yeah. So that's it. That was the profound thought I had today.</v>

70
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.020
At least you get to look forward to things that won't be that good.

71
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.200
You know what I'm talking about, but sometimes the surprise you, right?

72
00:04:34.201 --> 00:04:37.680
When the pops off, when you really do up jump the boogie. Right. But it's never,

73
00:04:37.681 --> 00:04:38.730
when you expect it though,

74
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.490
remember those times you were just driving around in the Valley with your old

75
00:04:41.491 --> 00:04:45.750
roommate and and you were like, eh, whatever. And then something happened,

76
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.840
Uh, like, uh, you know, like some cool happened and you were just like,

77
00:04:54.841 --> 00:04:57.390
Whoa. Yeah, dude. I didn't know that. That was going to be awesome.

78
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.770
<v 1>And then it happened, man. It's all good.</v>

79
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.750
<v 0>Actually that guy, I remember my old roommate, my old roommate</v>

80
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.260
and his buddy who I'm still friends with now,

81
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.790
he now, now his buddy is one of my, really, really good friends.

82
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.980
You know how that always happens. You're like,

83
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.100
you think you have a friend and then you meet their friend and then you guys get

84
00:05:23.101 --> 00:05:26.370
closer. And you're like, Oh, that's the real friend anyway.

85
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.480
So I met that guy and we still keep in touch. Yeah.

86
00:05:30.481 --> 00:05:33.450
I still keep in touch with the other guy too. But uh,

87
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.090
I used to do this thing with like waiters and,

88
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.630
or anytime someone will give you something like if you were like at a mail place

89
00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:40.170
and they were to,

90
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.170
you were to mail something and they'd give you a receipt or whatever I used to,

91
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.400
I used to do this thing for me. This is how dorky I am. Instead of saying,

92
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.170
thanks, man. I'd say, I'd say, I'd say, I'd say X-Men,

93
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.620
but I would do it. And they would never, they would never, you know,

94
00:05:57.621 --> 00:06:00.020
they'd never catch on because either there's two things that were going to

95
00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:03.440
happen. They're either not going to hear it. Cause they're so ready to hear.

96
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:04.274
Thanks man.

97
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.520
So say X-Men and they think are,

98
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.660
or so they either think they either just here, thanks man.

99
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.100
Or they hear me say X-Men and they think, well,

100
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:20.570
he obviously didn't say X-Men I misheard it.

101
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:21.980
So I'll just let it go.

102
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.210
So we were at this restaurant house of pies in a w in

103
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.950
Hollywood, you know? And I was telling my buddies about this,

104
00:06:33.951 --> 00:06:38.180
how I say X men sometimes. And it's funny for me. And he was like, really?

105
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:41.960
And I said, yeah, I said, guys, come by and drop the food off as like, Oh,

106
00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:45.050
X men. And they say, no problem. Cause I'm,

107
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:50.180
obviously not in their head saying X-Men but so my buddy Mitchell is like,

108
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.350
Oh, all right, I'm going to try it. And I was like, all right, cool.

109
00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:00.140
And I was like, listen, you can't say X-Men like, it's thanks, man.

110
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:04.490
Like, you can't be like X man. Like that's. You got to say X men.

111
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.280
You don't have to be like X-Men, but you gotta be like,

112
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.870
X-Men you gotta be like X-Men.

113
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:15.140
So the waiter drops the food off. And my buddy says.

114
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.840
<v 1>Excellent. And the waiter says,</v>

115
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:25.360
did you say X-Men

116
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.003
bro?

117
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.660
I don't know if there's ever been anything funny or that's happened.

118
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.940
Like I had been doing it for years nobody's ever,

119
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.740
and he just goes eczema. And the waiter says, did you say X-Men?

120
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:59.500
Oh, for sake, man. And.

121
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.450
<v 0>He was like, Oh no, I don't know.</v>

122
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.333
<v 1>Imagine.</v>

123
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.760
<v 0>Big X-Men to nobody yet. You'd be like, what, what?</v>

124
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.250
As far as the losing it's also even better.

125
00:08:12.251 --> 00:08:14.800
Cause like the X-Men movies weren't even like popping yet.

126
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.250
Like it was just like a thing that dorks wouldn't know about it wasn't like

127
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.450
Marvel was so big.

128
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:23.350
<v 1>He's just X-Men for no reason when he gets a waffle.</v>

129
00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:31.630
<v 0>Dude, I love like that, man. I love like that.</v>

130
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.450
Oh. I was had my hands,

131
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:38.440
like in my with my knees together.

132
00:08:38.441 --> 00:08:41.500
Rolling around on that pleather booth.
