00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.440
<v 0>Dude. I love eighties movies.</v>

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.850
I wonder if it's about me being from the eighties and it being nostalgic, like,

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.810
are my kids going to like watching this? They're probably gonna be like, dad,

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.200
I don't want to watch another Sergio keto movie or whatever the.

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.990
What's his name? That's the guy from iron chef. By the way.

6
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.100
What's his name again? Iron chef dude. That is the,

7
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.480
that's a killer gig to have Mark Casca

8
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.540
discuss, discuss the cast goes one fire, spelled it wrong. Cool. The cast goes,

9
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.390
um, [inaudible] you gonna get it? Wow. That guy.

10
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.620
Dude. He hard. Antonio Banderas.

11
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.300
I don't know. Who's hot. Who's hotter

12
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.070
Than him. That either of them

13
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.600
seen like when Antonio Banderas came and did the Desperado, was that the movie,

14
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.090
was it the movie? He did Desperado a scene in a sassy,

15
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.340
but there was, nobody was sexier than

16
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.950
Intiman Doris honestly

17
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.220
was the sexiest in assassins.

18
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.040
And that's everybody knows that.

19
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.280
<v 1>His hair.</v>

20
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.240
<v 0>This with the pubes coming out from the back,</v>

21
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.940
like he had a Dick on the back of his.

22
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:32.773
<v 1>Head.</v>

23
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.780
<v 0>I need to get a Dick on the back of my head and kinda of, um, kind of, uh,</v>

24
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.420
uh, what do you call it,

25
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.110
Dude? Remember this? See where he closes the laptop. Oh God.

26
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.670
What he does when he does. Oh, I'm going to reenact it on this video here. What?

27
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.513
I'm going to do it.

28
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.410
<v 1>Wow. The choices he makes</v>

29
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.690
it's slow motion, dude.

30
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.490
<v 0>He goes like that. This is how he does. He goes like this.</v>

31
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.660
Wow. That's honestly, you.

32
00:02:20.661 --> 00:02:25.610
Holly Fu would for not having him at least nominated for a golden globe and

33
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.350
assassins for that scene, dude,

34
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.380
closing a law make you don't understand making a choice.

35
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.390
That specific is as good as King speech.

36
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.680
It's as good as Colin Firth, dude,

37
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.110
Colin first and in King speech and Antonio Banderas.

38
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.790
When he closes the laptop and assassins both exactly the

39
00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:54.590
best kind of caliber acting. I swear to God, Dina Del Lewis would look at that.

40
00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:56.780
If he was smart and be like, wow, no, honestly,

41
00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.040
that's better than I was in the human quilt or whatever the that movie was.

42
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.110
Dude, when he it.

43
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.560
<v 1>What is he doing with his hand?</v>

44
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.270
<v 0>And it's slow motion when he opens his mouth. Dude,</v>

45
00:03:12.271 --> 00:03:16.140
who directed this amazing bro.

46
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.300
Oh, wow dude.

47
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.190
And you know Bandaras is so good because he is equal parts,

48
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.870
acting of the most intense that you can

49
00:03:30.871 --> 00:03:34.080
possibly do, but also doesn't give a about it.

50
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.340
That's the best acting you can do it, especially in the he does.

51
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.350
Like when you have guns, like where you're like, okay, here we go. Here we go.

52
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.430
But that he doesn't give a about it. He's like, well, what's going on?

53
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.690
What's going on? What's going on? You know what I mean, dude, it's so dope.

54
00:03:48.691 --> 00:03:50.910
He'll like, he'll like, he'll,

55
00:03:50.911 --> 00:03:54.090
he'll bust into a door and his hair will come over his face and they'll be like,

56
00:03:54.091 --> 00:03:57.270
okay, this is it. I might that tonight. But also it's all right tonight.

57
00:03:57.271 --> 00:03:59.700
It's all right to get there. I might do tonight,

58
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.360
but it's her right to get there. That's it. I'm an acting teacher now babies.

59
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.070
I'm an acting teacher now. And that is the pinnacle of acting.

60
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.300
I might that tonight, but it's going to be all right together.

61
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.300
That's that's how you act in everything.

62
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.460
You think that King speech wasn't I wasn't thinking that

63
00:04:20.461 --> 00:04:21.294
Antonio Bandera.

64
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.230
It also helps to be good at acting when you have hair that's long and,

65
00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:29.190
and it can like go in front of your face when you're doing like crazy sweaty

66
00:04:29.191 --> 00:04:33.930
scenes. It's secretly good acting. Wow man.

67
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:35.910
Amazing.

68
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.230
<v 1>He's my favorite actor.</v>

69
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.500
<v 0>What was the Jean-Claude van Damme chunk. Lot of fan dude.</v>

70
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.050
Jan cloud. The thing about Jean-Claude van Damme is he's four or five,

71
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.590
four foot eight. Probably. He's gotta be,

72
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.110
he's gotta be four foot eight. Oh, a skirt and under son-of-a-bitch.

73
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.530
Hey, how are you? Well, drums are my priority. You're like who opened the door?

74
00:05:07.531 --> 00:05:09.450
And then you look down over here.

75
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.640
Would you like to cut me in my wife? One of my wife's is making Keach.

76
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.213
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

77
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.710
<v 0>And then, and then, and then she's like,</v>

78
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.740
the Kesha is almost done John [inaudible] and he's like.

79
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.073
<v 1>For.</v>

80
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.460
<v 0>That's a good thing. Can't make more reader. We were done donating,</v>

81
00:05:35.461 --> 00:05:37.980
but I still want to do in the kitchen. Do you understand?

82
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.670
Do you guys want to see who can fit into a fireplace?

83
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.830
Do you want to see out of any of us who can fit into a fair place?

84
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.700
I bet it's me. And then other people are like, well that's not fair.

85
00:05:50.701 --> 00:05:53.640
You're four foot eight. And he just goes, get out.

86
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.280
<v 1>Wow, dude.</v>

87
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.530
<v 0>I'm fired to dive through it. That son of a,</v>

88
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.680
dude, what is up with you gotta be SU what the man.

89
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.060
Action heroes. They don't have that anymore. That real specific. I mean,

90
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:17.300
Stallone was like, Oh,

91
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.120
that's so specific. That's why it was so good.

92
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.020
John Covina was like going to kick that son-of-a-bitch by sends us short

93
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.380
ordered, and then Seagal,

94
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.310
the director just like speak up.

95
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.450
And he was just like I do with my hands. You know,

96
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.490
when it was just doing the, like he's knitting a sweater. And then he just done.

97
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.510
I swear to God, one in some scenes, he's just doing like batting, like a cat,

98
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.540
like this lewd. So God doesn't even know martial arts. He just made up that.

99
00:06:50.541 --> 00:06:54.560
He knows martial arts. Oh,

100
00:06:54.561 --> 00:06:59.120
this is what Steven Seagal says about Vandam and other action stars. Wow.

101
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.000
Since you.

102
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.870
<v 2>You've been here last four, hard to kill. We've had a lot of action.</v>

103
00:07:04.871 --> 00:07:08.620
Adventure stars popping out of the woodwork. Do you go watch the other guys?

104
00:07:08.621 --> 00:07:12.850
What do you think of Jeff Speakman or, uh, Dom? You know,

105
00:07:12.851 --> 00:07:17.200
do you know Bon Dom? Oh no. Oh, Oh, you've heard of, Oh.

106
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.400
Oh.

107
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.530
<v 0>I was so mad that he's bringing it up.</v>

108
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.840
<v 2>You've heard of him. Oh, look how Matt, uh,</v>

109
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:27.403
you you've heard of it.

110
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.590
<v 0>Wait, wait, wait. He says no, no, no.</v>

111
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.510
So confident has five girls in his green room right now.

112
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.440
And that's what he thought.

113
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.250
He literally thought this is what he thought when Arsenio hall,

114
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.790
as it Arsenio hall said, do you know how do you know van Dom?

115
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.440
And Stephen's a golf.

116
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.070
Literally went through this lightening quick as quick as it does his IQ though.

117
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.490
He thought, okay, well now,

118
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:53.710
now it's because this interview isn't about me.

119
00:07:53.711 --> 00:07:55.060
He's actually about another action star.

120
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.850
And that's not fair because this is about me. Okay.

121
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:05.500
I'm the. I have four girls in my green room. All good.

122
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:10.210
And then cocked his head and said, no, you know, do you know Von Dom? No,

123
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.313
that's what he thought. Right?

124
00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:18.970
<v 2>Wow. Let's start with him. Steven,</v>

125
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:23.390
what do you think of his work as a martial artist first? Oh boy.

126
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.940
I mean, cause like you guys go back.

127
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:35.620
<v 0>To say, can we change the subject? What a hater dude, what a hater.</v>

128
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:40.030
<v 2>This world before you were movie stars. Right? I mean, he was like, uh,</v>

129
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:44.410
a champion somewhere and right. I mean you, well, I mean, I,

130
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.730
I just promised all my mentors that I was going to be a good boy. Um,

131
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.470
I think that that's a matter of opinion that he was a champion anywhere.

132
00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.350
<v 0>I mean, dude,</v>

133
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.760
imagine being that much of a piece of.

134
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.550
I mean just be like, yeah, yeah, he's good. He's good. He does his thing.

135
00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:10.080
His movies kill whatever. it.

136
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:19.160
<v 2>Wow. And I mean, you know,</v>

137
00:09:19.161 --> 00:09:21.590
I'm not being catty or anything. I wish the guy all the best,

138
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.800
but there are an awful lot of people who say that that's not true.

139
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.840
How about Jeff Speakman? Nice guy. Huh? Wow. I mean,

140
00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.590
I was very good friends with his teacher. Uh, you know,

141
00:09:33.591 --> 00:09:38.420
I park was a good friend of mine and he seems like a real good, a real good guy.

142
00:09:38.421 --> 00:09:41.210
This kid I've never met him, but he seems like a good kid.

143
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.910
<v 3>Who's the most legitimate Hollywood tough guy. In your opinion, you accepted,</v>

144
00:09:46.911 --> 00:09:50.960
of course. When you say tough guides, you mean martial artists or just timing.

145
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:52.550
I mean, Steven, for real,

146
00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.120
if he was on the street and there was a situation you wanted this Hollywood

147
00:09:56.121 --> 00:09:59.330
guide by your side because he could defend himself Jr.

148
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.020
It's that hard to think of a legit one. Can you.

149
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:11.210
<v 0>Like he can't even consider another guy.</v>

150
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.690
<v 3>Should I laugh in your face?</v>

151
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.260
<v 0>Michael J. White. Can I laugh in your face dude? Wow, dude.</v>

152
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:26.750
You know what? We're learning in this podcast today.

So many ways to slam somebody before a fight.

154

I imagine being in a relationship with Steven Seagal. Hey,

162
00:11:03.051 --> 00:11:05.300

163
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.040
I have a question for you.

164
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:14.720
Where do you get off

165
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:18.801

166
00:11:18.801 --> 00:11:23.270
This house that you're in with 40 rooms who paid for it?

167
00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:29.180
Well, what do you mean? I mean, we both who paid for it. Well I just,

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:38.060
Do you think I've done enough work? What do you mean for,

170
00:11:38.061 --> 00:11:42.770
do you think I've done enough work? Yes, Steven, I get,

171
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:47.840
I get where this is going. Sure. I get it. So why would I take out the trash?

172
00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.390
Why would I do more work in the, that I, that I did the work for to pay for it

173
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:59.410
and then pick it up or killing someone for a.

174
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:02.710
Can I laugh in your face?

175
00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:08.010
<v 3>Yes. Well it's on hold on my belly. Yes.</v>

176
00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:08.940
Oh.

177
00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:09.900
<v 0>Wow. There's more.</v>

178
00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:16.230
<v 3>Can I laugh in your face? Really? Yes.</v>

179
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:21.630
Bolt-on shampooed bandana. Can I laugh in your face? Wow.

180
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:27.180
Shop NARS. I mean, Chuck is in his mid seventies.

181
00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:31.290
He's probably 76 years old. Okay. 75, 76 years old.

182
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:36.570
Wow. Interesting. I don't know. I don't, I I've heard that. He's not, you know,

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:50.160
Do I think he's a martial artist? No. Do I think John?

186
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.850
Cloud's a tough guy in martial arts? No. Why not?

187
00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:59.370
<v 0>You know like why not the ego on the guy that he can't even speak out?</v>

188
00:12:59.371 --> 00:13:03.390
Another guy that's good is unbelievable. Imagine if that's how it wasn't comedy.

189
00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.400
If somebody was just like, yeah, what do you think of,

190
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.380

194
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.170
Can I live in your face right now? Andrew San Dino Theo. Vaughn.

195
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:30.750
Can I love your face right now? Who do? I think he's a funny guy.

196
00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.660
Like just on the street. Like what the?

197
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.100
Wow. That's amazing.

198
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.240
<v 2>John Klein. Vaughn. Don, is that true? He got in a fight with you. No,</v>

199
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:45.900
I it'd be like me squashing an ant.

200
00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.770
<v 0>It would be like me squashing. An ant dude.</v>

201
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.980
Steven Seagal is like 60 here. Like.

202
00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.790
<v 2>Um, I don't know if I was in choir, but I remember reading something about that.</v>

203
00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.400
<v 0>Jean-Claude van Damme for sure. Ate his girl's for real,</v>

204
00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:03.600
because he couldn't her because it wasn't tall enough. Careful. Now I wrote,

205
00:14:03.601 --> 00:14:06.510
just look up on zipper pants and did her person.

206
00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:14.310
<v 2>You Larry? All he said he did like a spinning double one in front of me.</v>

207
00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:19.080
If he sees me, he runs well, he sent that he whooped some Akido or something.

208
00:14:19.081 --> 00:14:20.060
I don't know how far.

209
00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:25.530
<v 0>If he sees me, he runs here's Jean-Claude van Damme in his youth. I mean,</v>

210
00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:28.950
how could you say Jehovah dam is not a martial artist.

211
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.800
He literally can kiss his knee standing up.

212
00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:38.130
Wow. How could you say that?

213
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.020
That's so funny that somebody could be that insecure,

214
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:45.000
that they can't even give another guy a compliment.

215
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:55.400
Steven Seagal, his name. I wonder how much money he has.

216
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:59.180
He's like a real Republican, right? Like he like for Trump and.

217
00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.670
I mean, of course he is. Of course he is who?

218
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.410
A guy like that would love a guy like Trump because Trump is so, you know,

219
00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:11.980
whatever it is, what's that?

220
00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.120
Oh, right. Yeah. He does a Putin.
