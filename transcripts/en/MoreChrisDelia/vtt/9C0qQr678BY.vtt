00:01:55.191 --> 00:01:58.550

We found six people living in a small space in the house, which could be locked,

31
00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:09.860
but wasn't a basement. Hey man, guess what? It's a basement.

32
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.520
So you go downstairs, right? So this is what it is not a basement,

33
00:02:13.521 --> 00:02:17.330
but you can go into the main area, walk into the house,

34
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.280
then you go kind of in the back area. Then you,

35
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.400
there are steps you traveled to downstairs, then there's a door.

36
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.870
And then inside that door that can be locked, opens up. And then it is a room,

37
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.160
not a basement. Do you mean, well that's a basement. No, it wasn't.

His number one hit, not a basement. Oh,

00:03:43.861 --> 00:03:46.770

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.140
I'm waiting for the end of time in a secret room,

74
00:05:01.141 --> 00:05:03.360
not a basement over in a farmhouse in the Netherlands.

75
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:07.763
<v 1>[Inaudible]</v>

76
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.820

77
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.950
<v 0>Oh my God. Look at this bar owner, Chris Wester beaks,</v>

79
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.030
Then I had a chat with him and he revealed he had run away and needed help.

80
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.040
Then we called the police. He added,

81
00:05:32.041 --> 00:05:35.820
he had long hair, a dirty beard, wore old clothes and look confused.

82
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.920
That's literally everybody in the Netherlands has anybody in the

83
00:05:40.921 --> 00:05:44.580
Netherlands not looked confused or had a dirty beard and long hair and word on

84
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.020
clothes, dude, they're still on them, uh, cross colors. You know what I mean?

85
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.780
They're still on union. Uh, what was that,

86
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.290
they're still on a Miller's that they were submitted where Miller's outpost.

87
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.490
Oh dude. Oh, every fifth person in the Netherlands.

88
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.520
Whereas Miller's outpost is still yeah. What?

89
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:07.310
I don't see the problem and they have good deals and they are still everywhere.

90
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:08.144
So

91
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.360
I got ginkgo jeans from them and to have a cross color shirt is fine for

92
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.000
Marisol. Outposts really is good for a lot of back to school stuff.

93
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.950
Their nose up was killed it on the back to school.

94
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.910
I literally just found out it was a chain. I thought it was only a

95
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.870
place in locking you out of that. You'd go to, for back to school. Anyway, he,

96
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.580
uh, he said he had never been to school. Ah,

97
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:42.680
and hadn't been to the barber for nine, eight years. Hey guy go.

98
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.150
He said he had brothers and sisters who lived at the farm.

99
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:50.690
He said he was the oldest and wanted to end the way they were living. K

100
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:54.260
officers visited them, carried out asserts.

101
00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:57.710
They discovered a hidden staircase behind a cupboard in a living room. Well,

102
00:06:57.711 --> 00:06:58.544
I mean, why are they

103
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:04.580
so intent on making sure that we think that this is not a basement

104
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.350
who gives a? Like what happened in basements,

105
00:07:09.351 --> 00:07:12.140
in the Netherlands that they're like, ah, we don't.

106
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.710
That's like Germans with the, they're not,

107
00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:20.690
not liking to talk about world war II. No, not a basement. No, no, no, no,

108
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:21.583
no, no, no, no.

109
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.833
<v 1>Wow.</v>

110
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.120
<v 0>Local postman said he had never delivered a leather there.</v>

111
00:07:28.121 --> 00:07:31.270
It's actually pretty strange not to come to think about it. Oh, Oh wow.

112
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.170
Check this out. You thought everything else was net Netherland. Check this out.

113
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.510
The local postman said he had never just wait till the end

114
00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:41.980
of this sentence.

115
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.660
This is the most you've ever heard. This is the most Netherlands,

116
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.430
the Netherlands sentence you'll ever hear in your life.

117
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.650
And the first 80% of the sentence isn't even at all,

118
00:07:53.651 --> 00:07:57.340
any Netherland. That's how Netherland it is at the end of the sentence,

119
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.840
check it out. The local postman said he had never delivered a letter,

120
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.290
a letter there. It's actually pretty strange. Now I come to think about it.

121
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:10.240
He told a gleaming Dagblad news website,

122
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.010
Egg limine. Dagblad

123
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:26.830
Do it one time. I saw a comment on my podcast. He was like, I like his standup,

124
00:08:26.831 --> 00:08:30.640
but this podcast sucks. What the? I don't get it. It's not even funny.

125
00:08:30.641 --> 00:08:32.260
All it is is him making sounds.

126
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.850
Uh, anyway, Jesus Christ,

127
00:08:42.851 --> 00:08:43.840
these names yesterday,

128
00:08:43.841 --> 00:08:46.660
some reported to us that they were worried about the living conditions of people

129
00:08:46.661 --> 00:08:50.650
in a house in boudin. Who's her wig in row. I mean, come on, dude.

130
00:08:50.651 --> 00:08:54.130
They're just with us at this point. I get it.

131
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.410
After years of searching, I found my sister next to her. Okay.

132
00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:07.910
Anyway, that's wild, man. How many, how many years would it take for how many?

133
00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:13.190
I mean, how many, how long would it take for me to be in a basement or,

134
00:09:13.191 --> 00:09:17.510
sorry, not a basement Netherlands, but for me to be there to, uh,

135
00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.500
to where I would be like, Kay, I actually think maybe not the,

136
00:09:21.501 --> 00:09:24.800
it won't be the end of time anytime soon. So let's just go outside.

137
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:29.540
I'm real hungry. And I want to get my haircut. Maybe

138
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.650
Four days, no four hours.

139
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.740
I'll do this the end of times. Yeah, dude, for real,

140
00:09:39.741 --> 00:09:42.680
you go downstairs and then you're like, all right, actually it's probably okay.

141
00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.340
The quality of life isn't worth living down here in this basement.

142
00:09:46.341 --> 00:09:51.170
So let's just go cause there's and sucking to get done.
