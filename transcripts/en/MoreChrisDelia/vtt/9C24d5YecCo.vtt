00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.610
<v 0>Wanted to talk about something. I can't remember what it is now. Um,</v>

2
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:07.920
bro.

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.960
<v 1>When I was in, when I was in.</v>

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.380
<v 0>My early twenties, I would go to this place. Bob's big boy. They got,</v>

5
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.940
they had really good burgers and I almost,

6
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.210
I probably ate one every night for the hole for a year.

7
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.240
When I wasn't really concerned about my health. I was like 22.

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.230
Still looked like a, you know, they would, people would be like,

9
00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:28.740
what's going on? Is that one of the, is it a velociraptor?

10
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.690
Just because of how my body looked, not a good thing. Um,

11
00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:36.150
so, and uh, and I would,

12
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.850
and I would eat burgers just all the time and I would go to Bob's big boy and I

13
00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:43.650
would go and there was this guy named. What was his name? Ooh, Thai.

14
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.760
UT AI. That was his name. Where was he from? Mars.

15
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.300
Where's that name from? You got me baby.

16
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.750
Never heard the name before in my life had hair, like a Lego guy,

17
00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.410
like had hair, like it was a spar.

18
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.513
<v 1>Tin hat.</v>

19
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.440
His hair had more hairs capita than Neil deGrasse, Tyson.

20
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.040
<v 0>Billions and billions of particles. Billions of follicles in my hair,</v>

21
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.300
in my head started billions and billions of years ago.

22
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.650
Yeah. And he had an OU tie. Where's it from?

23
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.320
Looked like he could be from, for.

24
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.780
<v 1>Real Mexico, Hawaii.</v>

25
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.030
<v 0>Or Japan. Where was he from? Bow tie. Um,</v>

26
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.140
and so I really like to go Bob's

27
00:01:42.141 --> 00:01:44.000
big boy, man. I started to know everybody there.

28
00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:45.980
There was a waitress named Denise. There was a guy named Kevin.

29
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.100
Kevin always looked like an eighties action movie star. I liked Kevin a lot.

30
00:01:49.101 --> 00:01:51.950
He'd be like, Hey, what's going on man? And we'd just chat and. He'd be like,

31
00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:53.900
you want the burger? And I'm like, of course I'm here. Aren't I,

32
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.380
but every time I got Ooh, Thai, you would come up.

33
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.440
<v 1>And never said anything.</v>

34
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.320
<v 0>I swear to God,</v>

35
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.820
but this is skip.

36
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.270
That's what he would say. He'd come up. He'd say it's good. And I'd say,

37
00:02:14.271 --> 00:02:18.920
okay, um, yeah, I'll get the burger and he'd write it down. And I'd say thanks.

38
00:02:18.921 --> 00:02:23.120
And he'd say let's skip is skip dude.

39
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.830
E S C I B. And anytime I would bring it up new person there I'd be like,

40
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.140
ah, OOD eyes here. Watch he's going to say a skip. And they'd be like, what,

41
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.040
what the is a skip? I say, you just sit back and relax. He would come up, skip.

42
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.770
What do you want? I'll I'll get the salad skip.

43
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.380
<v 1>And one time,</v>

44
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.720
one night I realized what he was saying.

45
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.770
And I remember thinking, oh, that's what he's saying.

46
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.600
And a week later I forgot what I realized it was.

47
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.310
And I have never been able to remember it again.

48
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.590
And I'm so that I don't remember. What I figured out is skip was

49
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.300
I think about it every now and then you never know when some like that's going

50
00:03:12.301 --> 00:03:16.310
to hit in life, man, write this down is scared,

51
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.360
but what the is the scare booed? I

52
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.143
skip.

53
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.930
<v 0>What could it mean is skip.</v>

54
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.550
It's not, uh, it w maybe it was trying to say something it's good,

55
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.450
but it wasn't, it wasn't, it, it wasn't that it's good. It was a skip dude.

56
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.340
I'd watch his mouth.

57
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.040
I'd watch his mouth do the escape. And the book at the end

58
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.350
never gave a about me at all. Denise was a

59
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.170
sweet. Um, and, uh,

60
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.730
and then I went back years later and the, I was like, Hey, how's Kevin been?

61
00:04:05.731 --> 00:04:09.780
And he, I think he died. I was like, what?

62
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.890
A gay died. Sad, man. He was just like a young guy.

63
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.130
I wonder if Buddha is still there. Let me look up food.

64
00:04:20.131 --> 00:04:22.290
I Bob's big boy Burbank.

65
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.410
Bob's big boy,

66
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.740
boy. What if he just had like 50,000 followers on Instagram?

67
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.310
It was a skip on his,

68
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.970
his Instagram handle is escape. And he's just like living that a of life.

69
00:04:44.971 --> 00:04:45.804
And he's just like this.

70
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.110
I still don't know where he is. Cause he's in different places.

71
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.250
Just he's just other guys in Wales bathrooms. And it's just like, oh no,

72
00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.690
you just went on a family. Oh no escape. He goes into the thing. Oh no.

73
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.460
Whoops. Oh no. Just

74
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.350
blasted hair. All wet, but still puffy. Cause he's got so much.

75
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.310
<v 2>Hiro wit, but still puffy Cousy cast. So much.</v>

76
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.290
<v 0>Morale. JZ did the yeah.</v>

77
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.700
<v 2>Travis, Scott shouldn't play in a super bowl because they don't stand with cap.</v>

78
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.150
<v 0>What the NFL wants me to.</v>

79
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.810
<v 2>Be oversee what they're doing with football.</v>

80
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.470
I sign it as long as I can make money.

81
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.770
<v 0>That's what people think he's doing.</v>

82
00:05:43.771 --> 00:05:48.060
I don't know if that's what he's doing or not. Um,

83
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.070
but people are up in arms is Bob's big boy.

84
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.540
I looked up OOD. I,

85
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.790
I images for OOD. I Bob's big boy. You know,

86
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.080
let's go to images. Nope.

87
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.650
I can't believe I remember his name, but not if Kevin actually died,

88
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.760
what the is wrong with my brain that I remember some guy saying his skin and

89
00:06:18.761 --> 00:06:20.410
his name was OOD. I.

90
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.360
<v 1>But I can't actually remember if the guy I liked the most there died.</v>

91
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:27.910
<v 0>What the dude.</v>

92
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.720
<v 1>Dude, there was a TMZ thing that somebody tweeted me and was like.</v>

93
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.450
<v 0>They were like, oh, well.</v>

94
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.480
<v 1>This is funny or something. And I watched it.</v>

95
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.290
<v 3>Bro. I have zero.</v>

96
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.570
<v 0>Recollection of it. I'm.</v>

97
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.790
<v 1>39. I mean, I'm not even.</v>

98
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:47.320
<v 0>Close to 40 dude.</v>

99
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.070
<v 1>I have zero idea about a TMZ guy coming.</v>

100
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.240
<v 0>Up to me, asking me about some.</v>

101
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.040
And then a homeless guy came up to me and did it, did a joke. I don't remember.

102
00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.130
It could be a deep fake for all. I know.

103
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:07.990
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>

104
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.200
<v 0>All right. I don't want to upgrade the thing, dude, Mack, you know.</v>
