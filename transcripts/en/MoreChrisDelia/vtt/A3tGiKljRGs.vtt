1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.400
<v 0>But the one thing I do want to talk about actually on the flight out to it got</v>

2
00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:08.700
so delayed, but on the flight out to, um,

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.140
where was I going, dude? This is unbelievable. Just wait for this.

4
00:00:13.141 --> 00:00:17.670
I got to go to our text chain, cause this is where it was here, dude. They got,

5
00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:21.120
so we got, we were so delayed to go to,

6
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.140
into we're flying into New York from Albuquerque.

7
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.110
I was just me. Um,

8
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.550
and we were so delayed that they, they,

9
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.720
this flight was crazy. All right. It was from Minneapolis, I think,

10
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.460
to new JFK and

11
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.220
the F you decide this because, uh, the,

12
00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:47.370
the stewardess,

13
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.200
or I don't know if they just call them stewards now because you know,

14
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.200
the times are changing, but

15
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.830
she was so she sounded so drunk.

16
00:00:58.831 --> 00:01:02.940
It was unbelievable, dude. Okay. Susan's talking about it is, you know, again,

17
00:01:02.941 --> 00:01:04.980
I have, you're going to have your, your, your,

18
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.230
your chairs up in an upright assessment and it's all good.

19
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.920
Like that's what she was saying, upright Zishan. So, um,

20
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.180
this is the that she was saying here. Uh,

21
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.890
you decide if she's drunk or not, dude. Okay. You decide.

22
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.090
<v 1>[Inaudible] until the two is fully extended, please. Over your nose around.</v>

23
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.530
So that the last six round hole you're having to adjust a mask is necessary

24
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.560
breathe normally. And the oxygen is flowing.

25
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.390
Even if the fact is not afraid to secure your own mask before helping others

26
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.980
ox is your master to okay. In it, in the overhead panel and the laboratory.

27
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.320
<v 0>Instead of carrying it on, basically make sure to get it. And then it's, I said,</v>

28
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.800
Jen, I said, Jen dude, so drunk.

29
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.610
And then she would walk down and I'd be like, trying to smell this girl.

30
00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:03.350
I'm like, did you have alcohol? And I was trying to look at her.

31
00:02:03.351 --> 00:02:07.610
She didn't look drunk, dude. She was like, 50 dude.

32
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.650
I couldn't believe it. I saved this. And there's another one. Hold on. Okay.

33
00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:15.590
And then I, and then I thought maybe, and then some weird was going on.

34
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.930
And this dude, Oh dude,

35
00:02:17.931 --> 00:02:20.930
I was sitting at a bar before because the flight was delayed so much.

36
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.930
I got salmon because you know, I'm healthy babies. You know how I do it.

37
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.660
And this dude was sitting next to me and he was

38
00:02:29.661 --> 00:02:34.280
so loud and he was drunk and he was just,

39
00:02:34.281 --> 00:02:38.690
he would do, he would laugh. He would be like, Oh, cause you know, Tom Brady,

40
00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:43.580
yada, yada, like so loud. And then he would laugh and he'd go, Oh, Oh, Oh.

41
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.810
And I was like, Oh, I, I was like, I want it to knock this guy out. Right.

42
00:02:47.811 --> 00:02:50.540
But that was like, maybe he's got a problem. It's all good. You know,

43
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.050
maybe he's got a drinking problem. And as you know, I, I feel for that. Right.

44
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.930
So we were so late. And then we,

45
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.830
we exited the gate and were about to take off.

46
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.160
And then the pilot goes like this. Uh, so ladies, gentlemen,

47
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:05.860
we got to go back to the gate. There's something with customer service.

48
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.170
And I just go, I, I rolled my eyes so hard. I thought they fell on the floor.

49
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.900
Okay. And then I was like, what's going on?

50
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.150
And then I looked behind and there was this guy standing up and it's that guy.

51
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.170
And he's like, well, I don't know where my bag is. And the stewardess is like,

52
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:26.320
okay, well we'll find it. And he was like, I don't know which one.

53
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:30.670
I don't know where it is. He couldn't remember where he put his bag dude,

54
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.910
up on the top of the thing. He found one, he was like,

55
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.870
I have a computer bag back there somewhere. It's like, okay, well we'll find it.

56
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.000
We've got to get it. We gotta get him off the plane. He was so drunk.

57
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:42.280
They got him off the plane that kicked him off the plane because he was drunk.

58
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.590
And then the PA pilot goes like this.

59
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.070
<v 1>Sometimes people tend to take advantage of the, uh, the bars in the airport.</v>

60
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:51.773
And uh,

61
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.420
unfortunately DFA does not like it when people have had a

62
00:03:57.421 --> 00:04:02.310
couple extra drinks and it's not safe for passengers or

63
00:04:02.311 --> 00:04:04.680
the crew. So let's get an a,

64
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.140
I'll do the best we can and get you there as quickly and safely.

65
00:04:07.141 --> 00:04:08.400
Thank you for your patience.

66
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:09.960
<v 0>They kicked him off.</v>

67
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.390
So we went back to the gate and then we started to leave

68
00:04:15.391 --> 00:04:19.140
again. And this tell, she's not drunk. Now she's talking like this.

69
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.330
<v 1>Before you run into the plane, check</v>

70
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.720
out the baggage claim area.

71
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.790
And for those of you that are continuing on merit cases automatically even

72
00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:31.260
transfer for you. Oh,

73
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.363
what is she.

74
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.760
<v 0>Bro? I was like this. I was on a plane like this</v>

75
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.400
and nobody's paying attention. I'm like, this girl is drunk as, dude.

76
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.110
<v 1>You're right. And see the plane check out. The bag is</v>

77
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.993
[inaudible].

78
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.280
<v 0>And I've just been traveling to new Erik.</v>

79
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.740
Your life has been trapped for you.

80
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.690
Your luggage has been trapped for you. Okay.

81
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.230
There's there's and then there's this one dude, which is just.

82
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.293
<v 1>RCN.</v>

83
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:24.570
Ah.

84
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.380
<v 0>I said that's when she almost threw up in her mouth. I see a</v>

85
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.850
Customer of hers in life. That's what she said. Hold on. Just listen to it.

86
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.760
<v 1>One of them is now RC.</v>

87
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.660
Maybe have her to help. You want to hear? We have her so I can say baseline

88
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.150
pleasure having you on board.

89
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.283
<v 0>Ah,</v>

90
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.410
dude. Kick her off too.

91
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.140
It's been a pleasure having you on board Aaron in the

92
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:14.690
morning.

93
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.690
How? Okay. Here's the thing. If she's not drunk,

94
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.490
then she's got a speech impediment. I feel for you.

95
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.350
Why are you the one that's talking to everybody on the plane, dude.

96
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.360
I'm so sick of this, man.

97
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.480
We were also in trying to fly home and the guy that they try

98
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.480
there. Oh dude, the airports are insane, dude.

99
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.480
I swear to God if I saw and I'm I mean, no.

100
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.250
If I saw a wild boar working the desk at like one of the airlines,

101
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.240
I would be like, that's weird, but I, you know, yeah. I guess it makes sense.

102
00:06:55.241 --> 00:06:59.980
This is why everything's so up. Like it's it's insane,

103
00:06:59.981 --> 00:07:04.660
dude. I was, we were, we were waiting and the guy who was talking to the people,

104
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.800
first of all, everyone's in line, the flights delayed we're at the airport.

105
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.150
Okay. And everyone's in line and,

106
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.780
and the guy who is on the over the loudspeaker is like,

107
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.590
uh, he's so Indian and that's fine to be Indian,

108
00:07:20.591 --> 00:07:24.850
but this guy was killing it with the Indian. I mean, he was just like lovely

109
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:30.100
[inaudible] and everyone. And I caught that. He was like flights delayed. Um,

110
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.730
and we will be boarding soon and people are just lined up. Dude,

111
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.810
sit the down, dude.

112
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.100
What are you? We're all getting on the plane. All of us.

113
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.160
So getting on the plane, also the people who are lined up aren't even group.

114
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:50.050
Hey, and guess who group guests. Hey daddy.

115
00:07:50.051 --> 00:07:54.100
And he's sitting all the way down, man. His knees are bad, dude.

116
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.050
You keep your legs straight.

117
00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.730
You better be laying the down because that's crazy to be lined up when the

118
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.570
flight's delayed and you got this guy who's telling us the flight's delayed.

119
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.470
We're all going to the same place. I don't get it. I don't.

120
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.170
I'm so sorry. Yeah, we couldn't understand this guy because he was just,

121
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.610
they always give it to the guy who like can't talk in English, which is,

122
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.430
you know, and I'm not, I'm not saying like, Hey, learn the language.

123
00:08:24.431 --> 00:08:25.264
Like I'm not,

124
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.840
I love that America has got all the different types of people in all the

125
00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:31.180
different cultures and all the different accents. It's awesome.

126
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.710
You might as well just speak in your language though.

127
00:08:35.711 --> 00:08:38.080
If you're going to do that. I don't, I can't understand.

128
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.350
I sound so 80 years old right now.

129
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:48.910
Um, but yeah man, we got an oxygen mask and an oxygen also.

130
00:08:48.911 --> 00:08:52.150
Don't if the person is drunk,

131
00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:56.220
oxygen is the number one word that you're can tell that's what the thing should

132
00:08:56.221 --> 00:09:00.150
be. If you're a cop. Okay. Or have you been drinking? No. Say the word oxygen,

133
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.860
oxygen. Cool. You're coming with me. If you have one drink,

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:09.990

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.890
customer service say oxygen, oxygen. Okay. You're coming with me.

You can be so good at hiding it. Oh sir. I'm completely not drunk.

Um, yeah, kicked off.

Imagine getting, he was so not embarrassed to,

144
00:09:46.551 --> 00:09:49.230
I guess it was because he was drunk. It was killer. This guy was like, Oh,

145
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.380
you kicked me off. Cool. He was making a scene. He was like, cool.

146
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:54.560
I'll just get off the plane. Like this guy. I would have been like, yo listen,

147
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:58.190
sorry. I had too much to drink. Give me some bread.

148
00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:03.080
Give me some bread and a muzzle. I'll be fine. Tie my hands up. I'm getting it.

149
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.453
JFK

150
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:14.600
dude, oxygen, you know? Wow.
