00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:01.771
<v 0>One time.</v>

2
00:00:01.771 --> 00:00:05.190
I was talking to a girl and she said she went to Coachella and she had never

3
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:06.510
done Molly. And she was like,

4
00:00:06.511 --> 00:00:09.510
had her arms up and she was dancing around and the Coachella,

5
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.800
and somebody came up behind her and wiped Molly on her face.

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.950
Do it. Hey, let me tell you something. Okay.

7
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.410
If somebody ever did that to me and I've never done Molly,

8
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:22.650
I've never done drugs. If somebody ever snuck some drugs into me,

9
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.270
I'll tell you right now,

10
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.190
I would fight everyone around me until I was either dead

11
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.850
or high. That's how it will go.

12
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.490
If you wiped Molly in my mouth,

13
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.740
everybody around that person who did that is complicit.

14
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.620
I'm fighting everybody.

15
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.060
I see until I'm dead or tripping.

16
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.470
Cause I know once I'm tripping, I'm not going to want to fight everybody. Right.

17
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.740
I'll be like, I would, that'd be hilarious to be like fighting and. And just,

18
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.920
and just, if you were winning, just beaten the out,

19
00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:03.050
everybody just high kicks and just pop out,

20
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.880
choking people out and doing arm bars and then more people come in,

21
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.180
come on, pap, pap, pap, pap. And then all of a sudden you're just like, ah,

22
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.480
ah. Ah, man. I so good.

23
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.260
The Papa fighting. And then you're wrestling.

24
00:01:21.261 --> 00:01:24.920
But then also it kind of feels good. Cause people are like grabbing on you and.

25
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.280
And you're like, ah, God it. Until all of a sudden it just turns into it.

26
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.940
Well time got me feeling so free. They got Ms.

27
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.600
Santa brain celebrate and dance with me and they were still fighting a little

28
00:01:35.601 --> 00:01:38.660
bit. And you're like bah, but you're like, well, ma time.

29
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.520
And you're just sweating. So Ooh. Yeah. Zana brain

30
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.660
[inaudible] Oh yeah. You're just like, Oh. I've said I'm brain Papa.

31
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.120
I'm all the time is on your back. And you're just like,

32
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.540
you hike them up on your shoulders. And you're like, one more time.

33
00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.950
Got me a fan. It's so free,

34
00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.960
but you've got somebody on your shoulders and you're having a good time.

35
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:01.250
But also you're still kind of fighting people.

36
00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:03.800
And then all of a sudden you just let loose and you're just like, you know what?

37
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.060
it. Oh yeah. Tell him I'm Santa brain with me.

38
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.620
And then the beat drops. And you're just like,

39
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.360
[inaudible], you're bloody and exhausted in your shirt's rep. Then

40
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.360
 you're just like this place rocks. And you just have a blast for seven hours until all your spinal fluid 

41
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.360
has gone. That would be, that would be me. That would be what I did. And then 

42
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.360
when, once I came to and all the other guys who were complicit came too

43
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.360
, we'd be like, dude, that rocked. That was one for the ages. But if any of you are ever complicit in putting 

44
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.360
Molly

45
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.360
 in my face again, we're doing it all over again. And then look at me and they go like this. 

46
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.193
Oh yeah, we are dude. And then we ride off into the sunset center. Brian and Dan.

47
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.750
<v 1>So afraid. And Donna set up,</v>

48
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:05.170

49
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.910
<v 0>Credits, just roll. As we roll off into the sunset</v>

50
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.400
and it's me and the guy from ITTO mama tambien. Like that was like,

51
00:03:23.401 --> 00:03:25.980
he was there, dude,

52
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.170
this is what I see. This is what I'm talking about. When I've talked about the.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.500

57
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.720
She goes, go see a Rockies game. Whoa, dude.

58
00:03:45.721 --> 00:03:48.990
I don't want to watch guys play baseball when I can just think of like that.

59
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.570
That's so to me to think of a guy getting Malid in his face and

60
00:03:54.571 --> 00:03:57.720
then fighting until he got high and then riding off into the sunset, bro,
