00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.430
<v 0>I have a question. And this is a sincere question. No hate, no nothing.</v>

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.130
Cause the music say what you want, if you like it. That's great.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.990
Certainly sounds nice. How come every time I open up anything, my phone,

4
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:17.700
my computer, my closet, or my zipper. I have to hear,

5
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.610
I have to read a headline about how, how amazing Lizzo looks.

6
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.330
Why do I have to, I always read that. That's my question to put out there.

7
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.850
Why do I have to always read

8
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.630
Lizzo was on the carpet of the Vietnam VMs and looked

9
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.360
and Slade. She's a queen. Look at how she killed her outfit.

10
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.800
And then I got to look and she's wearing literally a Hershey's bar.

11
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.880
She wore a dress that said Hershey's on it the other day. And everyone's like,

12
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.280
and she absolutely killed it. Hey dude.

13
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.550
No, she didn't. And that's just a regular free song.

14
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.940
I didn't put out on iTunes, dude.

15
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.850
You don't look good like that.

16
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.550
Why are we pretending that I know why I know why I know why we're saying it.

17
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.210
I know why we're saying it because she's overweight.

18
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.440
And because there's been so much fat shaming in the world that now we got to

19
00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:27.200
backtrack and the pendulum swing too far the other way.

20
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.150
And now there has to be headlines every day about how sexy Lizzo

21
00:01:32.151 --> 00:01:36.620
looks. But Hey, what about this? Her music.

22
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:38.990
What about that?

23
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.540
What about how your making it so looks are there

24
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.720
most important thing? What about that?

25
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.980
What about that? You superficial?

26
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.000
Who cares? If, who cares? How she looks then? Who cares?

27
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:06.710
How she looks? Right. If who cares?

28
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.460
That she's a little overweight then who cares?

29
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.050
How she looks?

30
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.450
Why do we have to keep talking about how bang?

31
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.230
And she looks, who cares?

32
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.120
Who gives a? I don't care what weight she is.

33
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.190
If she's happy and killing it onstage, what the do I care?

34
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.350
I don't give a, but, but every time,

35
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.480
Oh, she looks banging in that well.

36
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.080
Did she give you a tinfoil? People be like Lizzie, Lizzie showed up.

37
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.200
Boy, did she slay in some tinfoil? Hey,

38
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.940
now you look at the 10 men. It's embarrassing.

39
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.270
You're embarrassing yourself. Bloggers. I hope she knows.

40
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:08.110
And she's just taking the and you guys just don't even understand her levels.

41
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.481
Hey,

42
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:15.190
also she remember when she did the thing at the basketball game and she just

43
00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:18.970
showed up with her out and everyone was like, she slayed her

44
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.590
was out. Dude. Her

45
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.980
was out. And we had to pretend like she slayed. Dude.

46
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.810
If my was out.

47
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:39.420
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

48
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.530
<v 0>My whole, my, my in front of apartment blinds, just pivoting.</v>

49
00:03:43.531 --> 00:03:46.110
And then I open up and my opens up and I just go

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.230
New man on a Minnesota Vikings. She showed up wearing a,

51
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.730
her she's milk chocolate wrapper. Hey,

52
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.130

53
00:04:05.131 --> 00:04:07.860
dude, why do we pray? And she slayed, dude,

54
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.970
if Halle Berry showed up like that, you had a roaster.

55
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.530
Rightfully so.

56
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.930
It's hilarious. What this world has come to.

57
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.930
Oh, she got that chunk. Huh? Look at that.

58
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.143
Jesus.

59
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.910
Look at what everyone says pretty. I don't know. Oh,

60
00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:43.440

61
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.970
Hey, you got grandma. Anyone that does, that is a man.

These chicks, you know, there'll be on the phone. Her voice is the.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.350
I hate when people say this, but I'm here for it.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.110
I'll make an album and I'll show up in a Hershey's outfit.

71
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.470
Imagine if I made an album and my voice was the and I was killing it.

72
00:05:31.471 --> 00:05:33.540
And then I showed up in a Hershey's outfit,

73
00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:38.100
how they would drag me down gown, the gown.

74
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.820

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.250
I had a guy, saw a guy with his, with a believer, all women shirt the other day.

79
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.160
And I literally just thought about how like my ex would lie to me a lot.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.930
