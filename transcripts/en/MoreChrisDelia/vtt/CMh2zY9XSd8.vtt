WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.830
<v 0>And, um, I, I aspire to be as friendly and nice as he, because he, uh,</v>

2
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.920
like, have you seen these videos, like Kiana Reeves?

3
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.630
Did you see the one of counter Reeves got, um, with the, on the bus,

4
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.090
uh, where, where the flight was was when was that?

5
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.110
The flight was like delayed this year. Right.

6
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.760
And let me just pull this up. Keanu Reeves,

7
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.380
uh, airport, airport van. Here we go.

8
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.480
Kendall Reeves and co passengers road trip back to LA. Oh,

9
00:00:38.481 --> 00:00:41.210
because he was in Barstow and they couldn't fly back or something.

10
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.330
Oh, Bakersfield. Yeah. So I got on a plane with counter Reeves.

11
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.840
He was very pleasant. Took photos, talked about latest project with two variants

12
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.250
are playing with Canada was diverted to Bakersfield. Hold on an announcement.

13
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.653
Yeah.

14
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.480
<v 1>You need to stay in this area.</v>

15
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.040
You walk out more. I can't stop you from walking out

16
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.710
and saying, Hey, I need to get on the plane. It's not going to happen.

17
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.690
<v 0>Canada's coast. How far they just announced, maybe talking,</v>

18
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:15.770
maybe taking the bus.

19
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.433
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

20
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.520
<v 0>Where are you going? Bakersfield was closed. There were no employees,</v>

21
00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:31.730
but they did open a Blimpie for account of got up.

22
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.830
Also airline employees in route to airport. Kendra has a question.

23
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.870
<v 1>[Inaudible] when you're back later or deal with customer service.</v>

24
00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.900
<v 0>That'd be riding the bus. We counter, he chose to stay in the wait,</v>

25
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.020
hang in Bakersfield,

26
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.080
or get on a bus with the Kiano and he's got the speed thing.

27
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.100
Okay. So kind of gets on the bus.

28
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.580
<v 1>California and the 52nd, most populous city in the nation.</v>

29
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.013
This is

30
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.970
two hour drive back to LA and kind of just sitting there and people were just

31
00:02:25.971 --> 00:02:26.810
filming him.

32
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.870
<v 0>In the bus.</v>

33
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.760
Like it could be so awkward and this guy

34
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.740
can, was just loving, look, counter Reeves,

35
00:02:39.741 --> 00:02:40.820
walking into Carl's. Jr.

36
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.260
<v 1>He just like, can you, can you put it, there you go.</v>

37
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:55.570
Right.

38
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.650
<v 0>There were then there were only five. Goodbyes are always sad,</v>

39
00:02:57.651 --> 00:03:01.330
but counters kept it together. Finally arrived, Man.

40
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.270
I just kind of reads his attitude is so

41
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.990
good, dude. I mean, it's just, I,

42
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.460
I want to be that positive and I just, I think that all the time,

43
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:16.720
I think that all the time,

44
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.460
and then something happens and it's all out the window,

45
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.720
dude. I want to be positive. I told you about the story in the podcast.

46
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:26.554
When I went to the John wick,

47
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.460
two premiere and I was like sitting there and I got to see counter read finally

48
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.800
has been a big [inaudible] fan for a long time.

49
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.400
And everyone is loving calories now. And I'm like the guy,

50
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:37.990
the annoying guy in high school. That's like, yeah,

51
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:40.180
but I knew the band before they started, dude. I was,

52
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.080
I've been through it with Kiano. I loved Ken Robinson's bill and Ted as a kid.

53
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.070
I loved piano. Never did I dip? Always. People were like, Oh,

54
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:53.050
he's not a good actor, bro. y'all okay. And I don't mean to say y'all

55
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.230
he is a good actor and he's also the last movie star straight up. But,

56
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.050
but, uh,

57
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.370
so I was at the John with two premiere and then I think I told you this story,

58
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:08.800
but I was so excited to see Kennedy is going to get up and talk in front of

59
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:11.320
everybody. So he does. And he's like, thank you very much.

60
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:15.880
And as he's leaving somebody behind me goes who Keanu and does a

61
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.540
line from point break.

62
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.170
And I'm like this going to make this moment about him. I'm so off at this guy,

63
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.390
making this moment about Canada, Reeves,

64
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.330
making this moment about him when it should be about counter Reeves and everyone

65
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:30.850
gets to share this experience, but this guy's calling out Hecklin counter Reese.

66
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.830
This I'm turned around. I'm so angry.

67
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.400
And then I looked back at Kennedy's Kendra's is smiling and did the other line

68
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:39.010
from the movie. And I was like, Oh,

69
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.020
that's the difference between a nice guy. And to me, the

70
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.880
roofs taught me about life. And he doesn't even know it. Dude.

71
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.360
The positivity that this guy has just so grateful.

72
00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.830
And I want to be like that every day. I think I want to be like that.

73
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.700
And then every day something happens

74
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.680
and we get back to, well, go yourself.

75
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.160
At least I have that though. I mean, I'm not even 40,

76
00:05:17.161 --> 00:05:20.940
I'm the youngest guy you ever met. But at least I still,

77
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.870
I have some life experience. At least, at least I still am hanging on to that.

78
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.310
I want to be positive. It all starts with there. I'm at the bottom step.

79
00:05:29.311 --> 00:05:32.100
I'm at the bottom rung of it. You know what I'm talking about?

80
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.910
I'm at the bottom rung of it. And at least I'm at the bottom rung of it.

81
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.140
At least I'm not underground. You know? Cause some guys are like, nah,

82
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.810
being positive. The world's negative. I'm a negative guy. it.

83
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.370
You can't beat them. Join them. I'm a troll, right? I'm not, I won't be that.

84
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.770
I won't be that. I want to be positive.

85
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.000
But as soon as I step out to a thing and then somebody is like,

86
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.760
Hey bro, nah, that's it, dude. You want to talk?

87
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.530
I'm not Kiano anymore. I'm kiddo in my head.

88
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.310
As soon as you want to talk, that's it dude.

89
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.100
Back to crystal, Leah,

90
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.870
don't this up for me, dude. I'm trying to live that Canto lifestyle.

91
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.640
I'm trying to live that Kiano lifestyle. And you're trying to it up for me

92
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.230
By talking. You know what I mean? By saying, Hey, what are you from? Hey dude,

93
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.620
loved you and workaholics. All right, cool. That's it. I'm out.

94
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.050
I'm out back to Krista, Leah, baby.

95
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.110
We can, we all be as positive,

96
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.130
positive as Kiana Reeves in a van

97
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.000
from Bakersfield to LA.

98
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.530
Imagine how mad I be. Dude.

99
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.810
Imagine how mad my blood. When we, first of all,

100
00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.250
this is how it goes. We're diverting to a Bakersfield. Actually. This is me.

101
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:11.080
Uh, what? We're diverting to Bakersfield. We can't get to the Y.

102
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:15.070
Hey, hello? Hey.

103
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:19.120
Why? Well we can't. Oh,

104
00:07:19.121 --> 00:07:23.560
well you're going to have to otherwise I get up and I get mad. Well,

105
00:07:23.561 --> 00:07:28.360
we're just going to, okay. So we land cool. Hey, there's no plane. Uh,

106
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:33.250
or employees. I bring the thing with me. I bring the button with me.

107
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:34.870
I'm out of the plane.

108
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.320
I bring the button with me and I put it up to where I'm sitting.

109
00:07:38.321 --> 00:07:42.340
I put it up above me and I go, boom. And I say, where's the flight attendant.

110
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.130
I should still be on the plane. So I should still have a flight attendant.

111
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:50.170
We landed early. Bring me a flight attendant. Yes.

112
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:54.490
Where's the new plane where there isn't one. Oh yeah.

113
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.240
Well, congratulations. I live in Barstow now. it.

114
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.070
I'm where I should be because that's when we land where we should.

115
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:08.770
So I won't accept that we're in, in Barre, Bakersfield, Barstow,

116
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.580
where the is the same thing. I won't accept them in Bakersfield, wherever I am.

117
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.360
This is home because that's where I thought it was going. You take me home.

118
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:21.010
This is home. Buy me a couch, buy me walls, buy me heat, buy me food.

119
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:25.510
Set me the up. I live here now. That's my attitude.

120
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:29.050
And if I was on a plane with counter, Karen will be like, well, you know,

121
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.620
maybe look, let's just go take a bus. Hey man.

122
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:37.630
I don't think you're listening to me, dude. I live here.

123
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.870
This is my home.

124
00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:46.390
<v 1>And counter was just like, let's take a bus.</v>

125
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.290
<v 0>The only reason way I'd get on that bus is if I was with Keanu</v>

126
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.920
and then imagine somebody looking at Hey man, speed all over again. Huh?

127
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.530
How mad I would be if I was County, I don't bring up my movies.

128
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.150
Can we just chill? Don't record me dude,

129
00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:08.540
but this guy's just loving it bro. Constantly. Sure. Film.

130
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:14.780
She'll take a bus. The Vertin no prob

131
00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:17.750
there's no employees.

132
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.930
All you got to eat is Blimpy's this guy's just loving it.

133
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.500
It's got a Blimpie's end Carl's Jew and stopped to get Carl's Jr.

134
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:32.600
On real. Uh,

135
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.820
so that's amazing.
