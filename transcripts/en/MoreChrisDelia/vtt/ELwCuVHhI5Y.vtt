00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.340
<v 0>Dude. I saw joker. Finally,</v>

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.820
I saw joker finally, and it is so good.

3
00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:13.440
And I know everybody thinks that, and everyone says that, but Jesus Christ, man.

4
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.330
Here's what I think.

5
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.250
<v 1>I could do that. I could be that guy.</v>

6
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.480
<v 0>And I can have the.</v>

7
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.680
<v 1>Uh.</v>

8
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.910
<v 0>Uprising that that character has. And I think honestly,</v>

9
00:00:34.911 --> 00:00:36.530
it starts with this podcast.

10
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.210
And thank you beforehand, because I know these,

11
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.600
the babies dude, these will listen to you.

12
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.690
You can listen them right now in your car.

13
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.190
We're probably at home because it's sad and you can't go anywhere unless you're

14
00:00:49.191 --> 00:00:53.360
in Missouri, but you you're my baby man.

15
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.880
And if I ever get in a insane asylum, you come and you break me out, man,

16
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.620
because I need you, dude. I'm not staying in that. Cause what I'm doing,

17
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.660
it's all I, I'm not evil. Okay.

18
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.990
What I think is that's what they did about that movie. That was so good.

19
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.650
They made you feel for that dude. And he was a psychopath killer,

20
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.270
But the whole world is different for me. Now that I have my son, man,

21
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.640
I watch everything different before I had my son. When I saw joker,

22
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.880
I'd be like, Hey, this guy. Wow, that's bad. That's crazy.

23
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.010
Now that I have my son, I see everyone as somebody's kid. And I get sad, dude,

24
00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:38.120
I watched joker and I got sad because I'm like, man, this especially,

25
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.810
cause he had the part with his mom in it. And I'm like, ah, this kid,

26
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.300
he was just a boy at one point, you know,

27
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.390
I want to say everyone should have kids. Cause it, it changes your world.

28
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.910
And I hate when people say that, but it's so true, man.

29
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.170
Everyone was somebody's kid once even the joker,

30
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.400
Even the joker, even the real joker. Uh,

31
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.810
but yeah, God Joaquin Phoenix was so good. The whole movie was so good.

32
00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:11.420
Todd Phillips. I don't even understand how you,

33
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.060
it's so hard to make a movie that's so sound and wrapped up in its own

34
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.440
world. And everything makes sense in that world that's created.

35
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.310
And when it's quote unquote a real

36
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.060
movie, like a movie that tries to be real,

37
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.850
I think it's in a way, even harder, like take the matrix one to me,

38
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.590
a great example of a movie that is,

39
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.460
that creates a world and then

40
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.820
it adheres to all the rules in its world. And there's no like false moments.

41
00:02:49.821 --> 00:02:51.950
I mean maybe there's one or two. I don't know how to dizzy it again,

42
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.610
but it makes sense within itself. You know,

43
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.140
people argue that like star Wars is like that. I don't really watch star Wars,

44
00:02:59.141 --> 00:03:01.810
but like, um, you know,

45
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:06.250
it's like a philosophy and it's hard to do that in a scifi movie obviously,

46
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:10.170
but it's so in a way easier, because you could just make up, you know,

47
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.350
that's why I don't like a lot of scifi movies. Cause there'll be like, ah,

48
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.600
the world's ending. And they're like, Oh yeah, well we in,

49
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.550
they just invented this thing like, Oh really? Yeah. Oh, let's use it. Well,

50
00:03:20.551 --> 00:03:24.690
the thing is it's only on Mars. Oh, well let's go to Mars. Well,

51
00:03:24.691 --> 00:03:28.230
the only way we can get there now because the doors are knots exploded the

52
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.790
things where we got to go back and dime. Ah. How do we do that? Well,

53
00:03:32.791 --> 00:03:36.690
there's a thing. There's a device. Oh, okay. I didn't know that. Yeah.

54
00:03:36.691 --> 00:03:39.270
Well they just made it when in the future. What?

55
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.340
I just came back to tell you this. Oh, okay. So you're not born yet. Nah.

56
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.570
And then if people are like, you know,

57
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.840
dorks with black Sabbath shirts or just eating popcorn, like,

58
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.990
well this is amazing. And so, um,

59
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.960
but the joke to do it in a real movie is,

60
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.430
is in a way harder because people are expecting realness.

61
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.370
It's like when people talk about the Chris Christopher Nolan,

62
00:04:08.371 --> 00:04:12.690
Batman about the joker and how it was real, like, okay. Yeah,

63
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.520
it did kind of adapt a real newness to it.

64
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:18.960
But dude at the end,

65
00:04:18.961 --> 00:04:23.820
Batman was still flying around from building to building and like had technology

66
00:04:23.821 --> 00:04:25.020
that didn't exist.

67
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.610
But the joker or joker rather didn't do that.

68
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.820
It was all stuff that could possibly happen.

69
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.920
And the world that they created in that world was all

70
00:04:37.921 --> 00:04:41.460
truthful and it was just amazing, amazing movie man.

71
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.290
And Todd Phillips came to see me, uh,

72
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.370
do stand up like a few weeks before joker came out and I was like,

73
00:04:50.371 --> 00:04:51.270
I can't wait to see your movie.

74
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.980
And I finally saw it and I dunno if he will hear this,

75
00:04:55.981 --> 00:04:59.430
but dude, I, I mean, I'm talking about,

76
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.920
I can't stop thinking of that movie.

77
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.680
I can't stop thinking about that movie and how good it was.

78
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.350
And here's what I think too. It should have won best picture.

79
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:08.640
I didn't see all the things,

80
00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:13.530
but I saw para parasite and that movie was good and it was

81
00:05:13.531 --> 00:05:17.700
very good. It, I think best screenplay. Okay. Give it to parasite. Fine.

82
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.010
But that movie was great,

83
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.360
but joker was great and also entertaining.

84
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.070
I thought parasite was a little bit and you know, this could,

85
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.930
I'm sure this was intentional. It was a little bit harder to watch because, but,

86
00:05:36.931 --> 00:05:41.790
but just every moment of joker was just like, it was,

87
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.350
it was, it got away with being relevant socially and also entertaining,

88
00:05:46.351 --> 00:05:50.880
which is like so hard. Yeah. Anyway, whatever enough of that. Uh,

89
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.550
since we're talking about movies, let's talk about James Bond.

90
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.860
I watched this video the other day. Oh my dude,

91
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.750
this killed me do it.

92
00:05:59.751 --> 00:06:02.330
There's a video on YouTube called seven inappropriate moments.

93
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.010
James Bond wouldn't get away with now.

94
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:07.790
<v 1>Andy.</v>

95
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.190
<v 0>It's on the pages, digital spy.</v>

96
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.500
And they just go through seven moments that it would get there.

97
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.860
Like some of them was Sean Connery and the other guys and. But dude,

98
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.880
I just love it. How times change men.

99
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:20.713
<v 1>Talk.</v>

100
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.600
<v 0>Turns a woman around says men talk and then slaps,</v>

101
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:28.790
harass. And she walks away. Dude.

102
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:33.770
Imagine if Daniel Craig did that in a quantum leap or whatever

103
00:06:33.771 --> 00:06:37.970
the it is. Condom solace for sake, dude.

104
00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:41.870
Why did they name movies? Something that you would never know what it is.

105
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.660
I don't know what quantum is. I don't even barely know what solace is.

106
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:54.500
Put them together or a ghost protocol, dude. You know,

107
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.393
go

108
00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:01.340
your self ghost protocol. Yeah.

109
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.550
All right, dude. Just call the movie. Jumping round.

110
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:07.340
<v 1>Tom.</v>

111
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.120
<v 0>Hank, Tom cruise, whatever did all this old ran off a bit. That's so dude,</v>

112
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.440
Tom cruise is such a big.

113
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.533
<v 1>Good.</v>

114
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.020
<v 0>Successful actor that he's like, no, we're not getting stumped, man, dude,</v>

115
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.460
I've done it all. I've. Every kind of thing in the world.

116
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.850
And I've made all the money, tie me up.

117
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.430
I'm swinging through that building.

118
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.000
So there's the, here's the other one Jesus. So loud.

119
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.303
Here's another one.

120
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.800
When he tells us he does the look when he tells the black guy.

121
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.980
<v 1>Where's your boat about my shoes.</v>

122
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.450
<v 0>Turns to the black guy and says, fetch my shoes,</v>

123
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.740
sell racist. Here's another one.

124
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:04.830
Oh, this, the Indian with a bunch of instancy.

125
00:08:04.831 --> 00:08:07.540
If I can find out anything more about your Indian guides, good.

126
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:12.640
<v 1>[Inaudible] for a few weeks. Was it.</v>

127
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.370
<v 0>Keep you in Curry for a few weeks?</v>

128
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.890
I don't even really know honestly what that means.

129
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.880
If there's a few where he's like slapping women, which is just crazy to me,

130
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.640
this is the best one though. I thought as in worst one

131
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.470
In an illogical and offensive plan,

132
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.970
James' attempts to blend in with the locals in Japan, by becoming Japanese,

133
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:35.440
thanks to a bad wig,

134
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:40.060
fake tan eyebrow extensions and some false eyelids dude,

135
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.790
what is this Austin Powers? I didn't realize how.

136
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:46.683
<v 1>And then he walks in.</v>

137
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:53.860
<v 0>And he says like, he walks into the undercover to the lady and he says</v>

138
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.120
[inaudible] And really look more Japanese. Like

139
00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.960
here's another one where he uses he doesn't take no for an answer. And.

140
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.750
<v 1>Where's another one. There was another good one. I thought no, no.</v>

141
00:09:14.751 --> 00:09:18.800
That one was just makes me uncomfortable. Tries to rape a lesbian. Okay.

142
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:24.380
<v 0>Um, Oh this was the one where he puts the dwarf in a</v>

143
00:09:24.381 --> 00:09:28.430
suitcase. Oh, Oh, disconnected.

144
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.360
We're where he puts the dwarf in a suitcase dude.

145
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.320
Like he's fighting.

146
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.440
Is that even the right thing to say dwarf.

147
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:43.940
It is what the interviewer says in a fist fight with a dwarf James

148
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.030
ridiculously traps knickknack. And I mean,

149
00:09:47.031 --> 00:09:51.170
the fact that he's called knick-knack anyway, you know, uh,

150
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.860
before carrying him out of the room and he's fighting,

151
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:56.923
he liked.

152
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:00.710
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

153
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:04.760
<v 0>He's just like walking towards him with the suitcase and then just.</v>

154
00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:07.880
<v 1>And.</v>

155
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:12.620
<v 0>They cut. They cut it to him already in the suitcase,</v>

156
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.170
obviously, because it would be impossible.

157
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:20.180
I mean the guy's name is knickknack prejudice.

158
00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.320
Um, wow. You know,

159
00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.520
imagine if you tried to get a movie done and you had a dwarf in it and his name

160
00:10:28.521 --> 00:10:32.030
was knick-knack in it now. Wow. Wow.

161
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:37.130
Canceled for me, canceling me for even supposing that,

162
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.190
uh, I would love if Daniel could, they, I want them that.

163
00:10:43.191 --> 00:10:45.140
Everyone's trying to make the most PC.

164
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:48.650
Like now they're talking about how the double of seven is going to be a woman

165
00:10:48.651 --> 00:10:50.900
and how James Bond has a daughter or whatever the it is.

166
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.720
all that dude go extra hard,

167
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:59.330
extra hard and just be like the racist bond to where he's

168
00:10:59.331 --> 00:11:02.540
just like literally says the N word in

169
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:08.900
or like just says stuff like let's because they're

170
00:11:08.901 --> 00:11:13.400
stupid about like just any other race. Uh, what.

171
00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.380
<v 1>The I, the.</v>

172
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.610
<v 0>World would be over. If, if James Bond came out,</v>

173
00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.370
I'll tell you what though. No matter what they do,

174
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.680
there's going to be a problem. So I can't wait for that.

175
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:27.470
I can't wait for the new James Bond movie to come out with the,

176
00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:31.310
with the black female double Oh seven or whatever the hell it is. I can't wait.
