00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.660

name-dropping city. Um, anyway, uh, yeah,

7
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.830
BTS looks like video games and they know it.

8
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.550
That McDonald's doc, you got to see it, dude. That guy is just awesome.

9
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:43.370
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

10
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.670
<v 0>I got a GRA I don't remember who I was talking to. This was recent.</v>

11
00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:51.620
This was this, this week. I'm like they were saying something like,

12
00:00:51.621 --> 00:00:55.190
yeah. Oh, that I'm not going to say who it was.

13
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.500
Cause he's a buddy of mine and I love him, but he's like,

14
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.120
dude got a place out in, uh,

15
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.130
the desert. And I was like, Hey,

16
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.410
what? And he said, yeah, I bought a home out in the desert.

17
00:01:12.411 --> 00:01:13.460
It's not even barely a home.

18
00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:17.750
It's like a little can that like I just decorated.

19
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.150
I said, yeah. And he said, yup, anytime you want to go. And in my head I went,

20
00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:26.450
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, let me stop you right there. I'm Chris D'Elia.

21
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.270
Did you think maybe you were talking to someone else, did you for a second?

22
00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:34.400
Think I was the Fisher King.

23
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.660
So he said, yeah. You know, and I just going to go out there sometimes.

24
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.100
It's just to unplug, let me ask you a question, man. This is the thing.

25
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.790
And it's been around for a long time. Ever since we like invented a microwave,

26
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.460
why do people need to unplug?

27
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.350
I truly think if you're someone who values unplugging

28
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.420
your like a drama queen drama, King,

29
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.240
uh, not level-headed insane person.

30
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.860
<v 1>He sat it. He sat</v>

31
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.720
at.

32
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.300
<v 0>Why do you need to unplug dude? What's up, dude. What's going on with that?</v>

33
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.340
You plugged in. Is that what it is? You plugged into much when people are like,

34
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.270
God, you know what? I'm so glad I left my phone at home.

35
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.160
It felt great. Just walking around unplugging.

36
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.100
It felt great. Just being out,

37
00:02:40.101 --> 00:02:43.340
camping in the middle of nowhere next to a Creek,

38
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.830
I just had to unplug even for a few days. And now I feel recharged,

39
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.420
dude. You know what? Recharges you a salad,

40
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:55.580
a burger.

41
00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.520
You don't have to sleep on to unplug.

42
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.150
That's a getting new,

43
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.200
I guess Western philosophy thing where it's like we have it's

44
00:03:10.201 --> 00:03:13.080
so good that you just can't have it. Good.

45
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.240
You're you're guilt. You. We have it so good. We invented walls.

46
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.480
We invented microwaves. There's a toaster out there, dude.

47
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.430
You could put your bread that we manufactured by the way in a toaster

48
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.010
and turn it into hot bread. That's better.

49
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.610
And because we've got it that good.

50
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.650
You think you got to unplug and be away from the toaster so you can

51
00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:41.130
recharge and be a stress-free better person. Well,

52
00:03:41.131 --> 00:03:44.040
let me tell you something guy who does that.

53
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.580
You're just terrible at bass

54
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.850
at bass, ER, terrible.

55
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.560
You don't need to unplug. You can go on vacation, fine experience.

56
00:03:58.561 --> 00:04:01.800
Another thing. Cool. Go to Hawaii, go to Bali.

57
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.080
Lay in a hot but sleep in a bedroom, man.

58
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.843
You know why?

59
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.100
Because we made bedrooms and it took us so many centuries

60
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.150
and, and, and thousands and thousands Mo millennia. What do you call them?

61
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.740
Millennial mullet, millennias, millenniums,

62
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.600
whatever the. That word is that part. Millennial, you know,

63
00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.600
we've spent thousands and thousands of years coming up with these

64
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.610
impossible thread thread counts, man. And you're going to go lay on a

65
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.500
rock. You just don't get how to be, man.

66
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.590
I get our millennia. That's what it is.

67
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.660
And I get how our eyes are adjusting because now we're looking at clothes

68
00:04:51.661 --> 00:04:54.330
screens all the time and our eyesights are worse than it was.

69
00:04:54.331 --> 00:04:59.130
But dude adapt like the tadpole man. You're not a tadpole.

70
00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:03.240
You're a frog. And that's a beautiful thing.

71
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.380
You think the frog has ever like, ah, man, I hate these legs. No,

72
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.130
they're just jumping from Lily pad to Lily pad going rebut,

73
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.050
enjoying their frog sense. Enjoy your human,

74
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.410
man. unplugging. I don't trust anybody. One plugs,

75
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.510
plugin unplugging all the time. Dude. You know where my phone is ever here.

76
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.100
You know, wherever my phone is, you know what? I've never lost my phone.

77
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.031
And I lost my phone. One time.

78
00:05:30.031 --> 00:05:34.080
It was in like 2008 and I'll never lose it again because I've been plugged in

79
00:05:34.081 --> 00:05:34.770
since then.

80
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.690
I left the diner at the standard hotel downtown and I left and I walked

81
00:05:39.691 --> 00:05:41.790
back and it wasn't there. And that was one of my favorite phones.

82
00:05:41.791 --> 00:05:43.860
It was one of those ones that slides out like that.

83
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.600
And it looked like you were in the matrix,

84
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.560
but whatever I've been plugged in ever since and some was talking to me for some

85
00:05:52.561 --> 00:05:55.680
reason so long. No man, I was no way.

86
00:05:55.681 --> 00:06:00.350
It wasn't 2008 that like iPhone. It was like 2002. Anyway,

87
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:03.080
it doesn't matter. When did the cell phones start? Yeah, I was like 2003

88
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.800
in August, 2019 in August. Uh, uh, 1999.

89
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:10.700
Everybody got a cell phone.

90
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.040
I left, I went to Vancouver to shoot a movie, came back.

91
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.560
Everyone had a cell phone and everyone was playing snake.

92
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.540
Um, yeah dude, I, you can't trust these people who say they unplug,

93
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.230
you just can't. You can't trust them with like secrets, bro.

94
00:06:29.231 --> 00:06:31.720
You're going to go unplug and change. That's the thing, man.

95
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.620
You've become who you are. And anytime you shift that,

96
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.260
like one time I was going out with this chick and she was like, Hey,

97
00:06:38.261 --> 00:06:41.830
I bought a chick. I bought a, uh, um, an airplane ticket to Paris.

98
00:06:41.831 --> 00:06:43.630
I'm just going to go for two weeks. And I was like, what?

99
00:06:43.631 --> 00:06:48.400
When she was like in a month and I was like, you didn't like tell me before.

100
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.920
She's like, I just knew if I didn't buy it, I wasn't, I wasn't going to go.

101
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.510
And I was like, Oh, we've been together for like two years.

102
00:06:52.511 --> 00:06:56.050
You just got to come buy a ticket to Paris and just go, sure enough.

103
00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.550
She went there. She came back. She broke up with me. Oh, Holy, dude.

104
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.710
We love, we love predictable people, man.

105
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.220
We love predictable people and I knew it was going to happen. And it happened.

106
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.380
If you let your girlfriend go somewhere for two weeks at a country,

107
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.700
you might as well break up with her for real. Same goes for guys. Girl,

108
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.140
if you let your dude just take a trip for two weeks,

109
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.700
guess what? See you later. You might as well move out right there.

110
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:31.983
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

111
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.670
<v 0>Well when my son grows up, that's what I'm going to tell him. No, no, no, no,</v>

112
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.740
no, no, no, no. Dude, you go from going away for two weeks, find a new girl.

113
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.430
He's gonna be like, but yeah, no, no, but honestly that's how it's going to be.

114
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.600
They leave and they find out some more about life and then they, they, they,

115
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:53.390
they're going to be like, I think we grew apart. That's the other thing too.

116
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.550
We don't grow apart with people, bro. If you're, I don't know.

117
00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:02.020
It's whatever I, what am I even talking about at this point? It, it does.

118
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:07.510
You know what? We could sum it up like this. Well that's quick. I like it.

119
00:08:07.511 --> 00:08:10.120
Slower. Better. Yeah, dude.

120
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:19.120
Um, anyway, what else was I wanted to talk about?

121
00:08:19.121 --> 00:08:19.931
I don't even remember.

122
00:08:19.931 --> 00:08:24.280
Should I do the last ad that we had a another ad today because of

123
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:30.100
