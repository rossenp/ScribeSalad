00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.650
<v 0>Let me play this. This is hilarious that Marvel did this. I love Marvel,</v>

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.640
but dude, once people's, here's the thing I don't like.

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.030
Here's what I don't like about twins. When they,

4
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.080
when they have an agenda,

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.390
any time I can sniff an agenda in anything I'm out, dude.

6
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.020
Woo. I'm out, man. I'm out that. If I'm going to go skydiving,

7
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.110
if I'm going to go watch people skydiving and I'm just along for the ride in the

8
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:34.320
plane and I'm just chilling and I don't have a pack on. And I'm like, well,

9
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:35.460
I would never jump out of a plane.

10
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.880
I just wanted to make sure that you guys were all safe and was here to document

11
00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:40.860
it. And then they go like this. Okay, cool.

12
00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:43.770
And start talking like there's an agenda. I say, give me the pack. I'm out.

13
00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:47.580
And I jump out, dude. I hate agendas. I don't like him. That's why,

14
00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:51.000
whenever you sniff something like, it's look, it's fine, dude. I get it.

15
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.710
You want to have, uh, all the equal opportunity and all the. And like, you know,

16
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.850
you should have all the different kinds of colors and every show is fine.

17
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.280
Looking like a F a McDonald's commercial. I get it.

18
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:04.050
Put a guy in a wheelchair in it. That's fine.

19
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.350
But the second you put too many guys in a wheelchair in a show.

20
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.390
Or the second I sniff that a guy was cast because he

21
00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:16.080
wasn't white. The second I get that, bro,

22
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.680
I'm turning on something else just because I don't want to sniff the agenda,

23
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.050
make it real.

24
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.950
<v 1>This is.</v>

25
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.960
<v 0>Best of that right here. This tweet is from Lilith. I love it.</v>

26
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.680
The first non-binary superhero in Marvel and they named them snowflake. No,

27
00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:37.550
this is not fake.

28
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.760
And then this is the thing I've watched snowflake and safe space. R

29
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.660
I I, there's two.

30
00:01:47.661 --> 00:01:52.070
One's named snowflake and one's name, safe space. First of all,

31
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.320
let me just tell you right now, that's worse than Batman and captain America.

32
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.840
That's worse than cool names because those names are for.

33
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.040
Who wants someone to save your life? You want, you want,

34
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.760
uh, uh, Marvel.

35
00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:16.730
What's the girl who didn't like when she was going through TSA.

36
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.990
Cause the guy fester a guy to hit on her. What's her name? Marvel head.

37
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.580
What's her name? Brie Larson. What, what the did she play?

38
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.590
Captain Marvel, Marvel head. I don't give a. Whatever she played.

39
00:02:30.591 --> 00:02:35.000
That name is cooler than Hey,

40
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.890
help, help. Don't worry.

41
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.440
safe spaces here. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

42
00:02:42.441 --> 00:02:47.150
I want the human torch. He's got fire. Look at this.

43
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.680
Also two white guys created this.

44
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.090
<v 2>Snowflake and safe space are the twins and their names are very similar to</v>

45
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.370
it's this idea that these are terms that get thrown around on the internet.

46
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.413
Yeah, no.

47
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.433
<v 0>We've heard them.</v>

48
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.580
<v 2>That they don't see as a derogatory.</v>

49
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.180
<v 0>I mean, okay.</v>

50
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.190
There's no super hero with the, with the N word. You know what I mean?

51
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.670
There's no superhero with any racial slur for a reason.

52
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.700
So let's not take anything derogatory and make it a positive.

53
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.010
Cause it gun get in trouble.

54
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.350
That's just right for the picking. That's a farmer going trouble.

55
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.123
<v 3>It's so easy.</v>

56
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.710
<v 0>Don't do that. Now look.</v>

57
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.760
<v 2>Those words and kind of wear them as badges of honor.</v>

58
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.550
<v 0>This guy doesn't even believe it. You know, he's just like, I don't know.</v>

59
00:03:44.551 --> 00:03:46.560
I got 40 grand for making this. These.

60
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.610
They told me to make them androgynous and I maybe Brown.

61
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.400
So I just did it look at this white guy,

62
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.840
just like I'm getting in trouble for this. Probably aren't I getting in trouble.

63
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.680
Saves face, dude trying. Oh wow. I love it.

64
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.540
You can get in so much trouble for trying to help.

65
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.790
<v 2>This Avanir safe space is kind of a big burly sort of stereotypical</v>

66
00:04:08.791 --> 00:04:10.350
jock. He can create force,

67
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.680
but he can only trigger them if he's protecting somebody else.

68
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.100
<v 3>Okay. I get it.</v>

69
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.890
<v 2>Hopefully. Cause non-binary then goes by. Snowflake is non-binary and.</v>

70
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.510
<v 0>But further snowflake is non binary. Um, he doesn't have a or a. She, he,</v>

71
00:04:30.511 --> 00:04:33.780
she does. He or she, he is not, she,

72
00:04:33.781 --> 00:04:38.520
I don't know whether to call her he or she because he or she doesn't exist. Uh,

73
00:04:38.521 --> 00:04:43.080
there is no Cocker on him or her and a bone structure is androgynous.

74
00:04:43.081 --> 00:04:43.914
You can't tell.

75
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.570
<v 2>Has the power to generate individual crystallized, snowflake shaped SRE.</v>

76
00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:50.040
Kim's the connotation.

77
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.160
<v 0>You know, caller called or some snowflake, dude.</v>

78
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.190
I would love it in the first issue.

79
00:04:56.191 --> 00:05:00.570
They just got just mowed down with guns.

80
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.190
You know the word snowflake in AR and then they'd just drive away and go Trump

81
00:05:05.191 --> 00:05:09.600
nation. What's your name? Snowflake.

82
00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:11.100
Forcefield say space.

83
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.053
<v 3>Yes.</v>

84
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.250
<v 2>Right now are something fragile.</v>

85
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.790
And this is a character who is, uh,

86
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.980
turning it into something sharp.

87
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.230
<v 0>I think it would have to that music in the background of boring to make it more</v>

88
00:05:28.231 --> 00:05:30.180
interesting. Listen to that. It's like, it's like,

89
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.260
it's like something that would be in like a nineties movie where a guy was

90
00:05:34.261 --> 00:05:38.190
picking a safe, it's always that music that they do with boring.

91
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.860
I hate that. I don't like that. I used to not, I made a movie when I directed,

92
00:05:43.861 --> 00:05:47.340
I wrote and directed a movie it's called almost when I was 23 years old.

93
00:05:47.341 --> 00:05:49.500
Nobody knows about that. And it's a straight up drama dude,

94
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.520
because your boy serious is. I'm serious as I'll get out. Okay.

95
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.780
I made it and it went to one film festival and as good as. All right.

96
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.730
And you can't find it anywhere and that's fine.

97
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.200
It wasn't even about showing people to me.

98
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:06.920
It was about making it and the process. I loved it. All right.

99
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.410
Anyway, um,

100
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.500
I put no music in the movie because I'm so sick.

101
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.390
It's so annoying when people you ever watched Grey's anatomy and it's like,

102
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.760
what are we going to do? [inaudible]

103
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.263
[inaudible]

104
00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.650
we got them [inaudible] Oh, Oh, we got a code red limp bump bump. Oh,

105
00:06:38.651 --> 00:06:42.580
but it's okay. Oh, here comes his wife. Oh, she's frumpy. Give me back.

106
00:06:42.581 --> 00:06:45.360
My husband. [inaudible]

107
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.820
all that. Just make it the show, man. Although the music in that show,

108
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.780
the outsider is tripping. It's so good. Anyway, here we go.

109
00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.770
<v 2>And uh, this is a character who is, uh,</v>

110
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:01.960
turning it into something sharp.

111
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.100
Snowflake is the person has the more offensive power and safe spaces.

112
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.420
<v 0>So out of the book, it's offensive. It's a more offensive power</v>

113
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.350
just using all these budworm buzzwords, right?

114
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.730
<v 2>More defensive powers.</v>

115
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.480
The idea was that they would mirror each other and compliment each other

116
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.670
snowflake and safe space.

117
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.690
<v 0>It's just wonderful. It's so wonderful. And I don't say wonderful,</v>

118
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.610
but it's so wonderful that they thought this was a good idea that this is where

119
00:07:30.611 --> 00:07:35.350
we're at in 2020 that they thought that this was a good idea to do this two

120
00:07:35.351 --> 00:07:38.590
white guys and the biggest funky company in the world.

121
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:47.770
And then also.

122
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:51.700
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

123
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.070
<v 0>Let's see these tweets here waiting for this.</v>

124
00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.680
This is a parody. It has to be. There's no way. This is,

125
00:07:58.681 --> 00:08:02.620
this is something that will be on SNL. Like they would come to save the day.

126
00:08:02.621 --> 00:08:03.340
They'd be like.

127
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.890
<v 2>Become safe space. And they're like, no, but really help me. I'm dying.</v>

128
00:08:05.891 --> 00:08:06.940
And he's like, well, I just want.

129
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:07.930
<v 0>To make sure you're not offended.</v>

130
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.670
Somebody wrote Robert writes,

131
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:19.900
are they still in denial?

132
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.410
That the people they are trying to pander to don't buy comics.

133
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.770
And then someone writes back to him just because they won't talk to your sweaty

134
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.140
at the comic store. Doesn't mean they're not buying Bobert.

135
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:34.120
That's funny actually. Um, Oh,

136
00:08:34.121 --> 00:08:36.490
this is hilarious. Some guy wrote safe spaces.

137
00:08:36.491 --> 00:08:41.380
Arch-nemesis will be a villain called reality. Wow. That's funny. Good job.

138
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:45.520
Moon Bob. Good job. Moon Bob six. Um, yeah, but do it like just,

139
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.450
just chill.
