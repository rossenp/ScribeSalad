00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.480
<v 0>There's something though. That's real my babies. There's something though.</v>

2
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.300
That's not a joke.

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.810
And it's how much I will never eat Sabra

4
00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:18.510
hummus again. Why?

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.650
Because of their commercial. Now I always say this here,

6
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.520
there should be no bad commercials period.

7
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.930
There shouldn't be bad commercials. Do you know why they're 30 seconds?

8
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.830
Do you know why 30 seconds of content should be easy?

9
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.680
Even if you're trying to get a message across and you're trying to take people's

10
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:40.530
money. Okay. Kleenex or whatever the it is.

11
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.863
<v 1>I saw.</v>

12
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.890
<v 0>This is all like just</v>

13
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.600
the whole culture or I don't even want to use that word. The whole

14
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.050
Superbowl commercial.

15
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.600
It's just people who say they watch super bowl

16
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.780
just for the commercials. Are,

17
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.300
are the most boring people in the whole universe. All right.

18
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.550
Cause do you know what the commercials in the super bowl, they suck. All right.

19
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.230
Maybe there's two funny ones every three years, but like,

20
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.010
they're not that good. All right. Also, if they're that good,

21
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.300
they should always all be that good. Every commercial ever.

22
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.510
So really you're just being a Kuda thinking.

23
00:01:29.511 --> 00:01:34.220
They're good because they think they have to be that good commercials are so

24
00:01:34.221 --> 00:01:39.170
easy. Dude. The most famous commercials of all time that have been spanning, uh,

25
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.060
spanning time, spanning time. We're spanning time ever that and Buffalo, 66,

26
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.500
we're going to span time.

27
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.130
One of the greatest movies ever asked them for a photo once and he said,

28
00:01:49.131 --> 00:01:51.530
I'd rather not. And I was like, Oh yeah, I forgot. You're a weirdo.

29
00:01:51.531 --> 00:01:54.650
It's all good. And um,

30
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.340
you know, D D Superbowl commercials, they pumped so many,

31
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.580
so much money into it and they're just so bad. All right.

32
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.860
And I'm not hating, but I, you know, it's like, get it together. Be better.

33
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.360
They're all glossy and.

34
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.390
This Sabra hummus commercial just takes the cake. Okay.

35
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.160
First of all, the catchphrases America, how do you mus?

36
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.300
All right. You're trying to make a thing. You're trying to make a catch phrase.

37
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.810
Now this comes from your boy Kango catchphrases.

38
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.970
I don't try to make these catchphrases. I don't, they pop off when they pop off,

39
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.140
I let them speak to me. Okay.

40
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.460
I put out in the world, whatever I talk about. It's.

41
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.890
And when somebody says, yeah, I'm a baby. I say, Oh, that seemed to work.

42
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.970
So now y'all are my babies. Okay.

43
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.020
When I tell you life reps, and then when it goes viral on Instagram,

44
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.110
the clip about me talking about how life I realize it's an ID. Yeah. All right.

45
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.840
And that's how we promote the life rips culture.

46
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.120
And even if you got bit in the face by a dog life, still reps, all right.

47
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.510
And all of a sudden, yeah. Now natch making bags off it,

48
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.180
but that's how you do it. You let the people gravitate towards you.

49
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.740
You don't shove a saying or some

50
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.010
MOUs in people's face. Okay. So Sabra hummus,

51
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.020
this got all these suits in a room and decided, well,

52
00:03:38.021 --> 00:03:41.740
we need a catch phrase. How about we shorten hummus to mus?

53
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.550
And then we make it like, it's a verb.

54
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.250
How do you mus now instant

55
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.090
BRM. My BRM meter is at an all time high. Now,

56
00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:59.770
for those of you that don't know a BRM is, is blood red mat. Okay. Thriving.

57
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.750
Why am I seeing red? Because the blood's up to Hegar all right.

58
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.910
So they made a commercial.

59
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.750
How do you must? And it's got,

60
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.650
now I'm a fan of some of these people and I've met some of these people and

61
00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:18.580
they're nice people,

62
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.010
but they put everybody that's like viral or in a meme

63
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.320
or famous for something either 50 years ago

64
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.180
or 20 years ago, or for something that lasted three days,

65
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.790
eight months ago in this commercial. And it is just so

66
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.750
what it is that I want to all over the place and leave it there for,

67
00:04:46.751 --> 00:04:51.310
for 35 minutes. And guess what? Sabra? That's how I must.

68
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.330
Okay. How do you must? Oh, well what I do,

69
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.690
my pants and leave it there for 35 minutes and don't clean it up.

70
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.880
What are you doing, Chris? It smells. I'm mushing.

71
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.890
All right. So dude, this is the commercial and this is,

72
00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:11.160
I don't even know who some of these people are. Some of these, I like America.

73
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:18.090
Okay. That's that guy? That wrestler guy. What's his name? Rick flair. Cool.

74
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.050
Rick flair. Great. You're back in the culture because the what's his,

75
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.430
what's the, uh, uh, the three Migos.

76
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.150
I'm going to call them the three Migos from now on. Is that why? They're the,

77
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.130
is that what it's supposed to be? Amigo?

78
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.620
Yeah. Migos, man. Get some Mexican hats or whatever they are.

79
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.800
Ah,

80
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.640
the three Migos.

81
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.070
You are the three Migos.

82
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.910
You're the three Migos. Did

83
00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.620
I figured this stuff out. So anyway,

84
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.910
[inaudible] this guy's back like his count track. Could you be more?

85
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.030
This is how could he be more tracking?

86
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.360
You must count Dracula. All good count. Dracula or Monaco.

87
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.670
Oh dude, you MAs. Oh,

88
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.260
I just DDT someone wrestlers.

89
00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:29.980
You know, now there's this chick who, I don't know who it is,

90
00:06:29.981 --> 00:06:30.761
but she's laying like,

91
00:06:30.761 --> 00:06:34.480
she's Nicki Minaj and she's got everything's yellow and she's

92
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.843
hot.

93
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.710
Then two people that are maybe trans. I don't know.

94
00:06:41.711 --> 00:06:44.050
Am I in trouble now? But they're muscle.

95
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.850
Cause you got to get everybody Mohsen dude.

96
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.360
If they only had white people Musson or God forbid white,

97
00:06:49.361 --> 00:06:53.950
straight white males Musson then their whole thing would be like, well wow,

98
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.870
Sabra you're canceled because of Musson. Everyone must is for everyone. Dude.

99
00:06:58.871 --> 00:07:01.900
I guarantee that's. That would be, that would truly be what happened.

100
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.500
They'd be like, muscling is for everyone. This is. And I'd be in my pants,

101
00:07:05.501 --> 00:07:07.180
leaving it there. And I, even though I'd be the straight white male,

102
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.820
I'll be like, this is how I'm Muslim. And I'm a straight white male.

103
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.300
That's T-Pain obviously no, of course. Of course.

104
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:21.100
That's sad. Okay. Of course. That's sad.

105
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.420
Okay. Why? Cause you know, T-Pain went bankrupt and if you don't know,

106
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.880
you still think about it for a little bit and you think, well,

107
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.240
of course he did though. So I do secretly know, even though I'd never read that.

108
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.380
And that's also the truth because he bought houses and all these cars.

109
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.690
Okay. Then now I like all these guys.

110
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:45.130
I like T pain's music. I liked the next one. Um,

111
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:50.020
uh, the guy who plays Steve Urkel. Jaleel white. Yeah. I like this guy.

112
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:53.290
Okay. But of course she's in this.

113
00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:56.143
Okay.

114
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.930
Now Amanda, Sharon, it's 70, right? Yes. I know that.

115
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.530
Like her too. I love her business sense. She kills it.

116
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:15.730
It's inspiring. But because she's in this,

117
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:19.870
then there's a guy that, that looks like Tim Robbins. That's not Tim Robbins.

118
00:08:19.871 --> 00:08:23.860
Don't know who this guy is, but he's mushing a pretzel pretzels.

119
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.250
Okay. Boomer. Oh,

120
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.250

121
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.630
and explosion

122
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.250
and the explosion.

123
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:45.250
These suits in this thing.

124
00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:50.350
A bunch of dudes. Just what about, uh, what about, okay, boomer? We got add that

You're going to give a phrase.

127
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:03.150
That's got eight days keeping the internet on fire

128
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.430
three months ago.

129
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:10.920
And now it's in this commercial with this chick.

130
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:13.260

131
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.220
<v 0>This? I don't even know.</v>

132
00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:18.450
And then she puts a whole carrot in there with the leaf on it on the end, like,

133
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.350
God go yourself. What is she? A sociopath?

134
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.590
She's got the whole carrot in there with the leaf on the end.

135
00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:29.790
Let these bugs bunny dude. And then she says, okay, boomer.

136
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:31.380
And then body rolls.

137
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.730
And exposion dude,

139

00:09:53.101 --> 00:09:55.050
I want to wake up and I want to go to breakfast with him.

144
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.480
I don't want to be having a great time and then do it.

145
00:09:57.481 --> 00:09:59.010
I want to go get mimosas with them.

146
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.550
And then I want to have a little siesta and have some lunch and then I want to

147
00:10:02.551 --> 00:10:07.500
take some muscle out and I want to put a spread out with all of the things,

And we can get boomers sizing and they say, well, how do you know?

170
00:11:30.381 --> 00:11:32.720
We can get boomers sizing because he's not doing anything now.

171
00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:37.880
<v 1>Oh man.</v>

172
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:41.720
<v 0>And the Superbowl com okay. So then by the way,</v>

173
00:11:41.721 --> 00:11:44.780
I know you're watching this people at Sabra because there's pockets too big.

174
00:11:44.781 --> 00:11:46.850
Every time I mentioned something, I get tweets.

175
00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.530
They're going to send me a package of Sabra hummus,

176
00:11:48.531 --> 00:11:49.770
and I'm going to have to roll around.

177
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.040
<v 1>There's a, I must.</v>

178
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.800
<v 0>Pizza and subtitles just,</v>

179
00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.730
and then there's this kid who definitely is on tech talk.

180
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:05.590
I don't know who this kid and all the yellow is, but he's definitely on Tik TOK.

181
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.073
He's gaming.

182
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:11.580
<v 1>Bananas. Don't don't lie. Nanas,</v>

183
00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.850
bananas, my spot and the Asian with the crab.

184
00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.910
<v 0>Bro, what, what, why is this so racist?</v>

185
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:23.580
And then you got the Chester Cheetos guy.

186
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:31.110
Then this magician guy, which is like, it takes, it's like he's doing his magic,

187
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:33.990
but really it doesn't count if it's a commercial.

188
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.570
Cause you're just using special effects. He's not doing it.

189
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:41.130
They did it with Sabra, the cyber people back pain, the beef Turkey,

190
00:12:41.131 --> 00:12:42.840
which is SRA cyst.

191
00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.550
<v 1>[Inaudible] this is how we</v>

192
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:04.283
woo.

193
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.633
This is how we.

194
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.830
<v 0>Dracula dude.</v>

195
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:15.623
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

196
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.960
<v 0>God idea was that whose</v>

197
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:25.110
idea was it to have T Payne sing jerky at the end of the song?

198
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:30.290
Also, how much is that song? A garage band beat. They didn't even pay for it.

199
00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.130
Cause they spent every, everybody they spent. So

200
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.640
they spent that they're like, we don't have any budget left for,

201
00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:45.240
uh, a song and they'd be like, well, um,

202
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.600
garage band was popular in 1999.

203
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:53.490
<v 1>Celery. I must pretzels. Okay. Boomer.</v>

204
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.380

205
00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:59.370
<v 0>That girl is actually kind of cute how she does that. I can't hate, but also no.</v>

206
00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.760
Oh God dude. I want to be in that commercial for real.

207
00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.070
And I want them to cut to me and be like,

208
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.630
I don't MOUs or me just with pants on and

209
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:12.240

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:19.530
with a bunch of Sabra hummus all around and my feet are in it and I just go like

211
00:14:19.531 --> 00:14:23.670
this and I go like this, this, this is how I must, I don't.

212
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.970
And then it cuts. But to boom, boom,

213
00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.990

This is how I might just get more and more crazy. And then me okay. Boomer.

215
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:39.570
This how I must [inaudible]
