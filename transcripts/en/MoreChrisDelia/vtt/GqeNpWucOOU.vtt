WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.320
<v 0>This video is the one of the, maybe of the year. Okay.</v>

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.000
This Papa John's interview

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.970
world on w WDRB news, uh,

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.650
Timothy Burke on Twitter, uh, tweeted a book,

5
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.220
a clip of a bunch of these things. This guy, Papa John's got,

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.790
he was on a call and an internal call that I guess leaked.

7
00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:26.700
And he said the N word a bunch of times, which is so weird.

8
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.250
My whole thing is even now in 2019, even if you are racist,

9
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.940
it's so weird to not know,

10
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.870
not to do those things. Even if you are racist,

11
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.950
it's so weird to know, like blackface a Halloween to just be like, yeah,

12
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.710
I know I'm going to get in trouble, but it.

13
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.950
Or to say the N word at a meeting, knowing it's bad,

14
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.750
this guy's in his fifties, maybe even 60 knows it's bad.

15
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.150
And to still be like, yeah, but I'm still racist.

16
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.080
Got to say the N-word got to just leak it out. Somehow in this, in this meeting,

17
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.730
I haven't said it yet today. I haven't heard the phone call,

18
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.530
but that it's just incredible. Is it out there? I wonder if you could find it.

19
00:01:15.531 --> 00:01:19.280
I doubt it's out there. What made it somewhere and the dark web, but anyway,

20
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.170
he got fired or, you know,

21
00:01:21.171 --> 00:01:25.190
he stepped down or whatever the hell happened from Papa John's and now there's a

22
00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:29.630
new guy running Papa John's pizza, obviously. And this guy

23
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.620
who used to run the,

24
00:01:33.621 --> 00:01:36.620
the creator or the owner of Papa John's whatever CEO of Papa John's,

25
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.980
what's his name? Uh, I don't know what his name is,

26
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.310
but anyway, the founder of

27
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.320
John Shatner, Schneider, John Schneider

28
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.700
use the N word on a conference call in may God.

29
00:01:55.701 --> 00:01:59.570
He looks like a guy that would use the N word too. You know? So anyway,

30
00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:03.440
this is a, uh, a clip, a bunch of clips from the interview.

31
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.060
Now that came out today, WDRB WDRB news,

32
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.960
WDRB news, about a day, they had to sit down and by the way,

33
00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:13.490
the guy who was interviewing is black,

34
00:02:13.491 --> 00:02:18.340
which is like so interesting because he's got, he was disgraced.

35
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.970
He said, Edward, anyway, here we go.

36
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.020
This is some of the stuff he's had 40 pizzas in the last 30 days. First of all,

37
00:02:24.021 --> 00:02:28.610
gonna die. Okay. First of all,

38
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.170
gunna die. That means, dude,

39
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.000
that means he's had a whole pizza for a lunch or

40
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:40.850
dinner. One of the days out of the 30 days in the month.

41
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.020
And then also 10 more of those days,

42
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.160
he ate a whole pizza for another meal,

43
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.090
a fat made of dough.

44
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.730
Just so much how's this guy, not 900 pounds.

45
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.573
Look.

46
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.310
<v 1>I've had over 40 pizzas in the last 30 days.</v>

47
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.790
Living currently in Mark Shapiro should be in jail.

48
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.560
<v 0>Okay. Who's that? That's the new guy.</v>

49
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.340
Mark Shapiro should be in jail. Who's Mark Shapiro.

50
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.140
We got to look that up as you look that up.

51
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.240
<v 1>Keep going. I've had over 40 pizzas in the last 30 days currently.</v>

52
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.770
And Mark Shapiro should be in jail. He has no pizza experience.

53
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.590
He's never been in the pizza category.

54
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.200
<v 0>Okay. So has no pizza experience,</v>

55
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.630
I guess he has no experience making pizza, I guess. Uh,

56
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.940
okay. Fine. Never been pizza.

57
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.880
You can tell he doesn't give interviews a lot. You know,

58
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.950
never been in the pizza.

59
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.840
[inaudible] it's like the, what?

60
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.020
Supersize me documentary board members, uh,

61
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.960
Livia currently and Mark Shapiro. Okay. So Papa John's new leaders,

62
00:04:03.961 --> 00:04:06.540
including Steve Richie who replaced him as CEO and the board members,

63
00:04:06.541 --> 00:04:11.170
Olivia and Marsha, where they should be in jail, dude. Oh.

64
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.140
Cause they stole the company away and now they've destroyed the company. Ah,

65
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.180
man, I man, I ain't going to jail at all. In any case, any way,

66
00:04:21.181 --> 00:04:25.950
shape or form over pizza. What are you in for a,

67
00:04:25.951 --> 00:04:28.890
I killed, if you guys, what are you in here for looked? If your kids,

68
00:04:28.891 --> 00:04:30.270
what are you in here for food

69
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.360
eaten 40 pieces in 30 days. That's what I'm in there for.

70
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.960
Why does he sound like he should be in a, in um,

71
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.430
with the lights out in just the silhouette talking in front of a,

72
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.520
like a curtain in a, in a holiday Inn, like a

73
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.570
hit over 40 piece. Sounds like an informant. That's trying to,

74
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.640
trying to remain anonymous, but he's.

75
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.580
<v 1>I've had over 40 pizzas in the last 30 days living currently and Mark</v>

76
00:04:59.581 --> 00:05:03.120
Shapiro should be in jail. He has no pizza experience.

77
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.510
He's never been in the pizza category. I would just say,

78
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.890
stay tuned. Their record will come.

79
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.100
The record will be straight. Why not set the record.

80
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.870
<v 0>Dude? The day of reckoning for what dude?</v>

81
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.730
You said the N word and you can't say the N word at a

82
00:05:23.731 --> 00:05:28.080
business meeting. If you're that racist,

83
00:05:28.081 --> 00:05:31.860
just go home and let it out to nobody at night,

84
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.370
just get home and just be like, okay,

85
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.800
you know, he's just sitting there eating 40 pizzas in 30 days, just like

86
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.120
forking, more marks or purer,

87
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.720
just eating food. That's why it sounds like that.

88
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.740
Cause he had 40 pizzas in 30 days dead.

89
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.120
<v 1>They tune their.</v>

90
00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.863
<v 0>Racking. So drunk.</v>

91
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.640
<v 1>The record will be straight. Why not set the record straight down? I mean,</v>

92
00:06:03.641 --> 00:06:08.230
what is it about the record? That's not stated.

93
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.130
<v 0>What does he have up his Papa John's sleeve. What does this.</v>

94
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.410
<v 2>Guy, what does this.</v>

95
00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.110
<v 0>Guy know that we don't know? You know,</v>

96
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.170
stay tuned next month. [inaudible] that? That's what it is.

97
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.340
That's the day of reckoning. I'm going to [inaudible] that.

98
00:06:30.341 --> 00:06:32.980
You're not even going to understand how many pizzas.

99
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.230
How about the fact too? This is the best part that Papa he.

100
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.370
<v 1>Why is he wearing the without curly?</v>

101
00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.540
Mark Shapiro should be in jail. He has no pizza experience.

102
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.600
<v 0>The Papa. John, he's still wearing a shirt that looks like a Papa John's shirt.</v>

103
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.600
<v 2>Guy wear blue. Hey guy wear a gray.</v>

104
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.900
<v 1>Had over 40 pizzas in the last 30 days. Dude.</v>

105
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.900
I've had over 40 pizzas in the last 30 days.

106
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.360
I've had over 40 pizzas in the last 30 days, dude,

107
00:07:10.361 --> 00:07:13.780
there was one that was really funny here. Over 40 pizzas.

108
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.560
This made me laugh for 40 pizzas, Timothy Burke, same guy. He put it.

109
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.060
I've had over 40 pizzas in the last 30 days.

110
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.360
I've heard over 40 pizzas in the last 30 days.

111
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.013
[inaudible]

112
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:47.380
who has had.

113
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.230
<v 0>Over 40 pizzas period.</v>

114
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:52.960
<v 2>Dude.</v>

115
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.010
<v 0>I've had over 40 pizzas in the last 17 years.</v>

116
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.400
<v 2>Not even that, even that</v>

117
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.690
if you've had over 40 pizzas.

118
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.450
<v 0>In 10 years, you're a fat pig.</v>

119
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.230
<v 2>If you have had over 40 pizzas in the last 10 years,</v>

120
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:16.030
if you've had over 40 pizzas in the last 10

121
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:20.380
years, you're a pig. It's like.

122
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.660
<v 0>The, the guys on the QVC.</v>

123
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:27.790
<v 2>We have got 40 pizzas and</v>

124
00:08:27.791 --> 00:08:31.300
we don't have them in the last 10 years.

125
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:37.360
We don't have the last 40 pizzas in the

126
00:08:37.361 --> 00:08:41.650
last five years. We don't have, can we go lower?

127
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:46.510
We don't have the last 40 pizzas in the

128
00:08:46.511 --> 00:08:50.620
last three and a half years. We don't have, can we go lower? Let me check.

129
00:08:50.621 --> 00:08:52.390
Hold on. Let me check and make sure we can go lower.

130
00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:57.240
We don't have 40 pizzas

131
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:03.570
in the last one year. We don't have the last.

132
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.650
We don't have 40 pieces in the last year we ate,

133
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:10.650
we ate 40 pizzas.

134
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:15.180
We don't eat 40 pizzas in the last six months.

135
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.580
Can you believe that we don't eat?

136
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.050
We don't eat 40 pizzas in the last six months, we donate 40 pizzas.

137
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:25.940
<v 1>In the last</v>

138
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.020
four months.

139
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:37.910
<v 2>Why don't need over 40 pizzas in the last</v>

140
00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.850
two months.

141
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:44.000
<v 1>Okay.</v>

142
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.320
<v 2>For a limited time only right now</v>

143
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:55.580
for a limited time only.

144
00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:00.980
<v 1>Now I've hit over 40 pizzas in the last 30 days.</v>

145
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.860
<v 2>For a limited time,</v>

146
00:10:06.861 --> 00:10:11.420
only 40 pizzas over 40 pizzas

147
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:13.850
in the last 30 days call. Now

148
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.790
we've got to look at these beautiful pizzas. We've got pepperoni.

149
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:24.380
We've got cheese, we've got pepperoni. We've got sausage.

150
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:27.140
We've got meat. Lovely. But I want to get a bit of meat levers.

151
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.010
We have got veggie pizzas.

152
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.840
You could have onions on them. You can have it on he's. We have margarita pizza.

153
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.210
We have barbecue chicken pizza.

154
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.150
For some reason we have Hawaiian pizzas,

155
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:45.920
even though pineapple doesn't belong on pizza. And everybody knows that

156
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.700
we've already voted pizzas in 30 days.

157
00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:54.320
<v 1>Also who's counting. Dude.</v>

158
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:56.280
<v 2>Imagine Eaton.</v>

159
00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:00.830
Imagine getting to your seventh pizza and being like seven dude.

160
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.600
<v 0>My favorite thread though,</v>

161
00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:07.040
under this was cause the guy looks really shiny and he and somebody right?

162
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.030
Writes. Why is he so wet? And then somebody under the under it writes,

163
00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.220
he's had 40 beaches and less

164
00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:20.180
that make you wet. I'm going to hard that hard at it.

165
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.290
Then somebody wrote, there are two kinds of people. One in the pizza category,

166
00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.800
two criminals. Oh.

167
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.540
Oh God. That. That's a meme for the ages bro.

168
00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:45.170
Somebody wrote it, made it whatever. ESPN 40 for 30 big Papa,

169
00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:49.700
ESPN films. 40 for 30. That's funny. Oh this guy.

170
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:54.280
I love out of touch people. It's so funny.

171
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.610
Why does he sound like that?

172
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:07.870
Why does he sound like that? Oh man.

173
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:09.880
I wish there was audio of him saying the N word.

174
00:12:09.881 --> 00:12:13.030
That would be so funny and bad and weird.

175
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:19.420
That's from a guy who eats 40 pizzas though, bro. I don't know.

176
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:25.650
Anyway. Oh. That makes me laugh. So I was in Florida.

177
00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:31.620
I actually ate a whole pizza in Florida. I won't build some less 30 days.

178
00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.530
I ate one pizza. I felt like trash.

179
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.580
I actually ate one pizza. One night,

180
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:39.983
a big one.

181
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.290
And then the next night there was nothing to eat in Melbourne and we ordered a

182
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:48.090
Papa John's dude, I just remembered this. We ordered Papa John's we got

183
00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:53.010
[inaudible] and I ate my chews.

184
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.770
And then, um,

185
00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:00.510
and then Mike and Zack got one

186
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.740
and I never, I didn't get a cheese pizza. I got veggie pizza.

187
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:09.690
Cause I'm trying to be healthy. It's hilarious. And uh, they got Hawaiian pizza

188
00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:14.750
and that's gross, dude. I, I,

189
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:17.700
pineapple is a amazing, huh?

190
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.940
Pineapple is so good. You know,

191
00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:26.100
it really is just an, a, a flavor explosion in your mouth.

192
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:30.870
If you don't like pineapple, I get it. But if you like pineapple,

193
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:34.710
I super get it. You understand what I'm saying? Put it this way.

194
00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:39.450
If there was ever going to be a fruit in spiked armor,

195
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:45.720
it would be pineapple because that's the one that tastes jamming.

196
00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.390
You understand? That's the one that tastes like

197
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.050
[inaudible] that's the fruit. That's the bang and hot new hotness fruit dude.

198
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:59.490
If any fruit was going to be covered in spiked armor,

199
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.360
it would be a fruit that tastes like that. If it was an Apple, you'd be like,

200
00:14:03.361 --> 00:14:07.860
it's not worth it. Dude. Apple is a great, but they're as good as their skin.

201
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:12.420
You understand pineapple? I used to have this joke where I was like,

202
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:16.830
Hey pineapple, why are you in spiked armor? What's in there.

203
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:22.020
$40. Stupid joke. Funny enough.

204
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:28.740
Uh, but what's in there 40 grand. I don't remember what the thing was.

205
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:33.150
It was stupid, but why is it so spiky? You know, like what was the deal?

206
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.850
This whole evolution of pineapple is crazy, man.

207
00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:42.270
You know what should be in a armor is a peak put. So

208
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:49.110
that's so good. Pizza is so good. And I can't stand a hookers.

209
00:14:49.111 --> 00:14:52.760
Keep talking about it on Instagram, but it is dude

210
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:58.130
Peter. So bang. And every time you take a bite of pizza, it's like this.

211
00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:08.170
