00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.310
<v 0>Um, yeah, I'm just about done with this quarantine. You know what I mean?</v>

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.130
Not for real. I understand I'm going to do what everybody's doing.

3
00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:11.010
How about that? I'm going to do what everybody's doing. That's the thing.

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.760
Quarantine is the most. If you can't beat them, join them scenario.

5
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:17.790
I have ever heard. All right. It's like, all right,

00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:20.760

we're getting it. You're all getting it.

10
00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:31.830
You're all shaking hands and holding the hands and protest right there.

11
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:35.290
Holding hands and protests. Why do you have to hold?

12
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.980
What if the rubbish and everyone's faces? Just protests.

13
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.990
Just be like open it up, open it up, open up the country. Open it up. But dude,

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.290
um, I'm if you guys, if you can't beat, 'em join. 'em fine.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.030

Let's get it, dude. Come on doorways and let's get it.

18
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.040
Now. I lied. I been just panicking, but you know,

19
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.830
what are we gonna, what am I going to be? What am I going to be?

20
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.430
One of the only guys sitting in his house, chilling,

21
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.560
trying to knock at that Rony virus,

22
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.620
everyone out there going to incubus, concerts and. And I'm over here.

23
00:01:16.621 --> 00:01:20.040
Just not Torin, not making those bags short.

24
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:23.160
I make the podcast sponsor bag. I'll make the road bags.

25
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:26.250
That's my bread and butter baby. I swear to God, dude,

26
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.600
after this quarantine is over one thing, the quarantine is made me learn.

27
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.600
And I'm telling you, and I know this isn't relatable and you know what, dude,

28
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.270
I don't give a. I'll tell you this much, dude,

29
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.100
I'm spending money like a do to the second.

30
00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:45.360
This quarantine ends. I go out and I spend money.

31
00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:47.280
I bring stacks of cash.

32
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.670
Like I'm see murder or master P.

33
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.220
And I just sh I just show up at places by and dude straight up.

34
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.170
it. And I go like this. How much?

35
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.200
Oh, I do it, dude. And then I go to another store.

36
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.120
Okay. No problem, dude. I'm spending money. I'm getting, cause here's the thing,

37
00:02:14.121 --> 00:02:16.400
man. I would be like, nah, I don't know if I want to spend,

38
00:02:16.401 --> 00:02:19.550
I don't know if I'm going to get that guy. I got the chain, you know,

39
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.250
it costs some money. I bought that a little bit a while ago.

40
00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:23.930
I should probably not buy the watch dude.

41
00:02:23.931 --> 00:02:27.200
When quarantine is over and your boy's on the road, he's getting that watch,

42
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.300
bro. You think I won't be different.

43
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.400
You think I won't be different when the quarantine ends. Holy, bro.

44
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.720
I'll be so different. You'd think I'm Asian. I don't give a F I sorta got,

45
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.040
I'll be shorter. I'll be a different person. I'll be wearing bandanas.

46
00:02:43.041 --> 00:02:47.480
And I just where's this. What am I doing? How we live in?

47
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.090
I'm cooped up in my house. I didn't get my kitchen done. Oh, what bro.

48
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.270
When this core team, when Trump goes quarantines over,

49
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.950
I go bring them dudes. We're doing the kitchen.

50
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.360
I'm going on tour doing the I'm redoing rooms that I don't even need to redo.

51
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.500
I'm getting chimneys, all sorts of chimneys on the top of my house.

52
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.290
I don't even have fireplaces. I'll get them. People are like,

53
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:13.590
but you don't have a fireplace. I'd be like, I'll get them later. it.

54
00:03:13.591 --> 00:03:14.424
Put a chimney up.

55
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.530
Why do I have the money for what all I'm doing is Postmates and,

56
00:03:19.531 --> 00:03:20.710
and watching Netflix.

57
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.440
I can't wait to spend those monies jackets, dude.

58
00:03:26.441 --> 00:03:30.490
It'll be summertime. Next year. Jackets upon jackets,

59
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.510
iced out gold teeth, pulling up in something.

60
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:39.160
So foreign it's unreal something. So they'd be like, where's that from?

61
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:41.320
I'll be like, Oh, it's from a country. They just started.

62
00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:45.430
There's only five guys there. What? Yeah, I know.

63
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:49.000
They just make cars. This is one of them. Wow. What color is that?

64
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.530
They didn't come out yet. See you later.

65
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.600
I'll do that. skid. That where you buck twice before you go,

66
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.440
you think I do one no way I go.

67
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.780
I go like that dude. And I take off an airplane and said, take off like this,

68
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.000
these. I don't do these anymore. I don't need to run away, dude.

69
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.070
I do like the GI Joe where the things go. And then I go. Or,

70
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.580
or, or I cartoon it. I get an airplane that takes off like this,

71
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.820
like that dude, like a.

72
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.270
And I ride to the next destination like this wreck, like the road runner.

73
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.390
You think I won't do it. I'm saying it now. So, you know,

74
00:04:33.391 --> 00:04:36.360
when I show up with a Bedazzler green Cape with a collar that goes higher than

75
00:04:36.361 --> 00:04:40.410
my head and uh, and a medallion over the thing that has a big C on it.

76
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.350
You don't say, well, what happened to Chris? Because you know.

77
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.513
<v 1>Wow.</v>

78
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.860
<v 0>Let's go out, let's get this Corona virus all become immune.</v>

79
00:04:55.861 --> 00:04:59.730
And then spend this money after we could get jobs again,

80
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.750
because what are we doing with all this? What are we doing? I, you know,

81
00:05:02.751 --> 00:05:05.040
I look at people live hand in mouth. I get it. But you know, it's like.

82
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.130
<v 1>That's 150 degrees.</v>

83
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.910
<v 0>It's all good, man. But I'm spending that money and Mark my words,</v>

84
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.480
kind bars out the, just all of them all. And it's not even expensive,

85
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:19.201
but like people are like,

86
00:05:19.201 --> 00:05:22.230
why does he feel his car with so many boxes of kind bars? It's like, well,

87
00:05:22.231 --> 00:05:24.630
because he just spends money. That's it. And he doesn't want to talk about it.

88
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.650
What's that? You know? And the car, the car is something far into it.

89
00:05:28.651 --> 00:05:33.300
It's a new country. I will do that. And I can't wait.

90
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.460
I can't wait, me off. Just started making money.

91
00:05:38.461 --> 00:05:43.200
And then the whole world shuts down. Ah, but it's not relatable. Whatever,

92
00:05:43.201 --> 00:05:47.940
dude, listen to NPR. If you want to be relatable, dude, this about this cult.

93
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.370
I got to start watching Waco. I got to start watching Waco.

94
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.280
Pick up some tidbits. Play with that.

95
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.200

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.190

00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:17.780
dude. I saw you once out. Not even in LA.

100
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.430
Forget where I think I was in Nashville. I don't remember where the I was,

101
00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:23.211
but I was there to do it.

102
00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:26.510
And I saw you with five dudes and you were the best looking one, but dude,

103
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.740
that doesn't phase me. That doesn't phase me. I have a personality. Okay. Any,

104
00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:32.450
I look like a big bird, but it's all good, man.

So you're going to walk in the room, dude. Taylor Henkins.

106
00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:40.360
You're just going to walk in the room. Okay. All right.

107
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.103
All right.

108
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.143
<v 1>Uh.</v>

109
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.240
<v 0>He cuts his hair,</v>

110
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.580
he cuts his hair and does a mullet and looks better.

111
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.290
How he doesn't Theo did it and looked like a lesbian. He does it.

112
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.170
It looks better somehow and puts on some funky glasses and does Waco.

113
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.520
And you look better, dude.

114
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.590
I'll fight you until my last breath. And it'll be way before your last breath,

115
00:07:11.591 --> 00:07:15.610
by the way, my wind is not good. But um, so, uh, anyway,

116
00:07:15.611 --> 00:07:18.400

118
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.840
I said it right. I keep saying firing on all syllables.

119
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.900
It's firing on all cylinders. And I know that and I kept saying it.

120
00:07:28.901 --> 00:07:32.770
I was having a brain fart anyway. Um,

121
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.700
w where do I get these ads? See, that's the thing.

122
00:07:36.701 --> 00:07:40.960
