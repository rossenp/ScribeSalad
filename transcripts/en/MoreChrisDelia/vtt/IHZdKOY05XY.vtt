00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.510
<v 0>It's been an eventful week for me. Uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.050
I've been telling people that I have the number one song in the world,

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.750
which is crazy. It's my, really my first, uh, my first, uh,

4
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.510
kind of stab at making, making real music.

5
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.960
Uh, no. Yeah.

6
00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:25.680
I know a lot of you guys are probably wondering me about wanting him to talk

7
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:28.770
about the Eminem logic song that I should say logic,

8
00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:33.270
Eminem song is logic feature and Eminem, but yeah, man, I,

9
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.130
they called me, uh, a week ago before, before the, uh,

10
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.130
like maybe a five days before the song came out and my manager was like,

11
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.840
look, the, you know, the remember logic. And I was like, yeah.

12
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.850
And he was like on an M and M and him are doing a song

13
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.660
and you know, they're gonna, mm.

14
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.590
Put your S your impression of him. Okay.

15
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.930
And the, and the song. And it looks like great sound.

16
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:11.130
Like he wants to know if they can use it. And I was like,

17
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.760
are you kidding me? And he was like, yeah, well, I'm going to say yes, but like,

18
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.410
I, I'm going to protect you as a cam.

19
00:01:21.411 --> 00:01:24.770
Okay. And like, I was trying to get you money, by the way.

20
00:01:24.771 --> 00:01:28.070
I don't know how much it's going to be, but, and I was like, dude, no,

21
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.580
don't ask for money. Just give it to him. I don't care. I'm not a rapper.

22
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.650
Let them use it on the song. It's comedy fine. So, uh,

23
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.290
you know, and then,

24
00:01:39.291 --> 00:01:42.760
and then I put it and then I put it up and then they put it on a came out and

25
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.490
it's just like, I'll tell you one thing, man, look,

26
00:01:46.491 --> 00:01:49.640
you do all these things as a comedian or I, you know,

27
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.390
whatever industry you're in, you know, as an actor, as a comedian, as a,

28
00:01:53.391 --> 00:01:55.880
in the entertainment world, whatever the you want to say, like

29
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.370
all this stuff, you reach your, you know, you reach goals as they go on.

30
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.570
And you know, I've been wanting to do specials. I do specials, bam. You know,

31
00:02:05.571 --> 00:02:09.770
my first specialist came out. That was, uh, uh, a Mark in my career.

32
00:02:09.771 --> 00:02:12.710
That was like, amazing for me. Uh, you don't,

33
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.280
those are the things that even though they're goals, you exp you, you,

34
00:02:16.281 --> 00:02:18.770
you expect them in a way because you,

35
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.810
you have confidence about yourself and your career. You're like,

36
00:02:20.811 --> 00:02:23.030
I'm gonna do a special one day. It happens. You're like, wow,

37
00:02:23.031 --> 00:02:25.970
I can't believe I'm doing this. But you also, you knew that this was the goal.

38
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.060
This kind of stuff is always like really special because you don't know that

39
00:02:32.061 --> 00:02:35.600
it's going to happen. You know, you always thought, Oh, cool,

40
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.560
I'm a comedian. But when this happens, it's like, Holy.

41
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.620
I've been a big M and M fan for a long time.

42
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.670
I've been listening to a lot to logic for quite some time now to, before that.

43
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.990
Uh, and, uh, but I mean an em, an episode for like 20 years. So when he,

44
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.340
when he posted the tweet, when he tweeted about me,

45
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.500
that was really cool. He tweeted about my impression,

46
00:02:57.501 --> 00:03:01.840
but then when he put it at the end of the, it's just kind of crazy to me, man.

47
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.100
Like, uh, it's just so weird.

48
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.750
It's a trip. It's cool. It's awesome. Uh,

49
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:15.190
and that's all I really have to say about it because you know,

50
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.900
I, you know, to, to even, I know you guys want me to talk about it.

51
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.390
This is why I'm talking about it, but it's very cool. Partying wants to play it.

52
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:28.180
Cool. And be like, yeah, you know, it's like rolling. This is together,

53
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:32.710
but it's like, it's, it's, you know, it's very cool. Uh,

54
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.930
and it's, it's cool to see, like, I mean, this is worldwide.

55
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.920
Like people from Germany are like, I just found out who this comedian is,

56
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.800
uh, that Dawson impression of Eminem, right? Uh,

57
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.260
here's an American comedian. There was this other guy that was doing a, a,

58
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.340
um, reaction video. I don't get reaction videos on,

59
00:03:57.341 --> 00:04:01.460
I guess it's just like a, a thing on YouTube, but they're like, there,

60
00:04:01.461 --> 00:04:05.530
there was one guy that was like reacting off of my video

61
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.260
or off of my impressions on M and M impressions. And it was so funny, dude,

62
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.120
the guy was just like, he kept on being like, all right, man,

63
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.770
he's onto something, man. He's onto something. M and M he's on C.

64
00:04:20.771 --> 00:04:24.010
I saying that to Eminem rom that don't rhyme.

65
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.260
Um, there's reaction videos.

66
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.030
The song now has 11 million views on, uh,

67
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.780
on the, uh, what do you call it? A YouTube.

68
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.240
And then I posted way too many napkins as a comment. And it has 9,000

69
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.220
likes. And then I look at it all, but you know what?

70
00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:52.720
The dorkiest is reading. That's the guy I'm going to play a little bit of that.

71
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.280
Reading the, reading,

<v 0>My God.</v>

76
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.780
Maybe I know what it's like now for people who come across babies that are like

00:05:10.781 --> 00:05:14.650
doing my language and. And people are like, what the are these lunatics doing?

00:05:31.751 --> 00:05:36.580
Me cops. How can you identify M and M me?

82
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.380
He doesn't breathe. It's all about

These guys aren't humans, no oxygen needed. Just throwing fire.

86
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.180
Look at this logic wraps fast, M and M hold my oxygen,

Uh, Oh my God. People cutting down. Trees was never really the problem.

90
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.170
It was logic and M and M wrapping together. Ah,

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.580
cause they'd take all the odd. Here we go.

92
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.790
Arianna Grundy seven rings,

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.460
logic and M and M seven lungs.

94
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.090
Half-assed it. Plot twist.

95
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.800
M and M is logic's father. Oh, what plot?

96
00:06:47.801 --> 00:06:51.970
Twist on a song like it's game of Thrones.

97
00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:00.970
Wow. Um, I hear what you mean. Is there another one?

98
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.430
Logic Eminem? We have broke the internet mumble rappers. What? It cost logic.

99
00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:14.860
M and M oxygen. Wow

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.400
reacting. I guess this guy's pretty popular.

104
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:42.940
Um, here or this guy. It's a little penis and mean at the beginning of this guy.

105
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.380
No, like Shaq, his name is, so this guy is just.

106
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.610
<v 2>Let's check this out. Y'all know. We, we,</v>

107
00:07:50.611 --> 00:07:55.140
we react to comedy a little bit on this, telling them so this'll fit right in.

108
00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:59.050
And, and it's very relevant to what's going on. Okay. Brian Mills.

109
00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:00.850
So we finna check this out.

110
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.020
I actually wanted to see him do the impersonations. Like,

111
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:08.980
I don't want to hear the audio. I wouldn't see him doing it, this kid.

112
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.240
And he started out for him and they were wrapper. Of course.

113
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:22.360
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

114
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.390
<v 2>Oh, that's exactly how I am in nail raps, bro.</v>

115
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.070
He had to start off with something,

116
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.040
go away now feel you don't forget what he started with. Now.

117
00:08:30.041 --> 00:08:31.960
He'll come back instead of playing around with,

118
00:08:31.961 --> 00:08:35.200
when he started with as exactly that and when they were wrapped, bro,

119
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:40.330
he bears and foes words that make it fit in his mind, screen broke.

120
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:43.780
And that's exactly what he was doing. I'm doing it.

121
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.920
<v 0>And then he's just telling people I'm doing it.</v>

122
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.550
And this has a hundred thousand views. This guy, this guy,

123
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:54.540
this guy kind of kills it. Huh? This guy kills it. This guy's,

124
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:59.580
he's kind of he's watchable though, for sure. Um,

125
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:05.790
anyway, that's been my world for the week. Um,

126
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.700
it's been very cool. Uh,

127
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.270
it's just cool when people kind of appreciate what you do. You know what I mean?
