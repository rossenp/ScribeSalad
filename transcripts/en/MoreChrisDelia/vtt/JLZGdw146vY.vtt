22
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.940
in the R and B group with the circular glasses low on your nose.

23
00:01:25.941 --> 00:01:30.170

he got the lowest voice in boys to men.

29
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.630
And let's see what it sounds like in real life. He's probably just like, yeah.

So anyway, y'all here's Nirvana. Here are the nominees eight,

31

43
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:00.763
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

44
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.050
<v 0>The song of all time. The loneliest song of all time. That was, Hey,</v>

<v 0>I guess if these guys are singing in a field or not,</v>

49
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.980
if you're listening to the podcast, so it.

50

<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

51
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.230
<v 0>No, no.</v>

52
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.290
What the world needs now is not another folk singer and it never needs that.

53
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.780
<v 1>For smells like teen spirit</v>

54
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.570
winner takes all great. There we go.

55
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.440
And before we announced the winner,

56
00:03:49.441 --> 00:03:52.620
I like to plug the Christmas album that was previously recorded by boys to man.

57
00:03:52.621 --> 00:03:54.990
And what's villains. Now I would say the winner.

58
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.160
<v 0>Oh man. So uncomfortable. They're all laughing. And there's so Maddy to that.</v>

59
00:03:59.161 --> 00:04:01.020
They're like, whatever you do, don't plug the pictures of them. Please.

60
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.800
<v 1>Here we go. I'd never seen this by the way.</v>

61
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.090
I like to thank my family and our record label

62
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.970
and our true fans.

63
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.980
You can't believe everything you've seen here now, Kenya.

64
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.610
Oh my God, that guy.

65
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.460
<v 0>That guy who came in was that Dave Grohl now. Right? When that, Oh,</v>

66
00:04:47.461 --> 00:04:50.220
that gets even great. That it's not, they were okay. When that guy came in,

67
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.830
he was like, Oh, I'm going to shut this down, dude. He was like, here we go.

68
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.280
I'm going to shut the down. He was thinking of it on the way to the show.

69
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.750
It was like, if we win,

70
00:05:00.751 --> 00:05:02.550
which we probably will because there's a lot of heat around us.

71
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.610
I'm going to dip in and I'm going to say that thing when Kurt Cobain is doing

72
00:05:05.611 --> 00:05:08.160
the thing and he thought it was going to shut the down,

73
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.630
he thought everyone was going to lose their minds.

74
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.970
He thought Wilson Phillips was gonna start crying.

75
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.320
And that Boisman was just going to start that that's it [inaudible].

76
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:19.380
<v 1>Wrap around. Wow.</v>

77
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.350
<v 0>Wow. Begans is going to lead us to dream about this every day.</v>

78
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.440
<v 1>That guy, Oh, it's really hard to, Oh,</v>

79
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.210
this is where it, that's where it went off the rails.

80
00:05:33.211 --> 00:05:34.200
You can tell I've never seen this,

81
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.080
but right there with like a depression is when it went off the rail. Here we go.

82
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.430
You can't believe everything you've seen here now, can you.

83
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.320
<v 0>Basic blanket the system thing. You know,</v>

84
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.090
he's wearing purple pants now, now,

85
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.370
now how mad is Kurt Cobain that he did it, but he was like,

86
00:05:53.371 --> 00:05:55.140
I'm just going to roll with it this year. It doesn't matter. Anyway.

87
00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.890
<v 1>You know, it's really hard to believe everything you read.</v>

88
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.630
Oh, Oh, remember Joseph Goebbels.

89
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:11.573
Oh

90
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.700
wow. Wow.

91
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.000
<v 0>It's so funny. Their music like means so much to so many people and like,</v>

92
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.770
they've been there. Like, they're just like

93
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.990
what that Ray may pick when people are like, feel that, you know,

94
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.350
just getting raped by the system. Like just so good. And then,

95
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.210
Oh no, no, no. And just 15 year old kids were just like,

96
00:06:37.211 --> 00:06:40.480
God it speaks to me. I love this music. And then.

97
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.750
<v 1>And our true fans. And then dude,</v>

98
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.070
this dude just when it comes to talk and this is why this guy's the drummer or

99
00:06:48.071 --> 00:06:50.320
whatever, you can't believe everything you've seen.

100
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.550
<v 0>Oh bro, pick up an instrument. And then, and then this,</v>

101
00:06:54.551 --> 00:06:58.450
and then you're so mad because what's his name? Kurt Cobain was like,

102
00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:00.940
I'm going to, I'm going to kill it. I'm going to do the thing. And that like,

103
00:07:00.941 --> 00:07:03.550
I couldn't wait. He thought cocoa bean, wasn't going to do it. He was like,

104
00:07:03.551 --> 00:07:04.840
he's pitching out. He's not going to do it.

105
00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:06.040
So he dipped in and the cocoa is like,

106
00:07:06.041 --> 00:07:08.980
I got to go in early and I got to do this now. And then just completely.

107
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:14.260
<v 1>You know, it's really hard to believe everything you read.</v>

108
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:21.220
Remember Joseph Goebbels. Y Oh.

109
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.480
<v 0>He's a BI. So wait. So it's really, you know, it's really hard to</v>

110
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.840
believe everything you read. I think he meant to say

111
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:41.440
don't believe everything you read. It's it's really hard to

112
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.320
believe everything you read. Okay.

113
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.040
He's like the guy from South park. Who was that guy?

114
00:07:51.041 --> 00:07:54.520
Chris crisp Crist,

115
00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.940
sir. Danish. Chris Novo select

116
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.633
Novoselic eh,

117
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:09.640
Chris Anthony Novoselic Croatian. Oh, that's one thing.

118
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.530
Croatians are the strongest people in the world.

119
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.980
One time I wrestled a Croatian guy.

120
00:08:14.981 --> 00:08:19.120
I was like rustling a tree after Nevana disbanded, fallen from Kurt,

121
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:23.080
Kurt Cobain as a drift. Apart from a musical endeavors.

122
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.590
Nova cellar has been active politically. Oh really? That's odd.

123
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:31.150
He's been active politically ever since that moment, including a creature. Wow.

124
00:08:31.151 --> 00:08:34.390
That's hilarious. Well,

125
00:08:34.391 --> 00:08:36.190
that is what let's see the comments.

126
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.390
This is the most nineties thing I've ever seen. Yeah. Really?

127
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.790
Remember when MTV look, kids.

128
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.000
That's what happens when punk rock gets big?

129
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.390
Wait, who's Joseph Goebbels. I've heard it of that.

130
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.630
Oh my God.

131
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:12.600
I mean saw Hitler's propaganda guy. Eh?

132
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.570
Not the time.

133
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.470
Well you won. Hey dude. You're the best band on earth. Amen.

134
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.880
Remember Hitler set.

135
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:30.990
Not the time. Don't care. How punk rock Yar.

136
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:37.320
12 year olds are watching mom. Who's Joseph Goldberg. Oh, he hated Jews.

137
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:41.640
What's that? Uh, there's racism in the world. What? You like?

138
00:09:41.641 --> 00:09:42.810
Some people don't like Jews and,

139
00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.900
but with all my black people that some people don't like, Oh,

140
00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.730
really shouldn't know it already.

141
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:51.710
<v 1>Wow. Dude.</v>

142
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.950
<v 0>Look at this guy. Just making up comment.</v>

143
00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.350
They didn't like what was being said on the teleprompter.

144
00:10:00.351 --> 00:10:02.750
That's why you can see Kurt reading and just saying thanks.

145
00:10:02.751 --> 00:10:07.730
Chris was just saying they are propagandists. All right, man.

146
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.280
You know you're 50.

147
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.090
Oh man. Wow, man.
