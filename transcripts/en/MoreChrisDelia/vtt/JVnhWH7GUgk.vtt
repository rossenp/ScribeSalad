WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.150
<v 0>Yeah, dude, but, uh, that's, that's it.</v>

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.770
And my dog has got AIDS all over his face. Yeah, dude.

3
00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:10.020
Butters is probably going to die, dude.

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.260
He butters looks like the guy from the Goonies with the bent ear.

5
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.680
He just looks like he's just a breath away from being like, Hey,

6
00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:21.480
you ain't got hive, dude. He had a eye problem. So I took him to the vet.

7
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:23.611
And when you go to the vet,

8
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:26.040
you got to wait in the car and then the nurse comes out in your hand,

9
00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:30.540
the dog over to the vet and then the vet walks it in and then you wait in the

10
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:34.290
car, like a big, dumb idiot. And I was,

11
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.150
and I'm in the car for one hour and then they come back and they're like, yeah.

12
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.760
So he's got an eye infection and I'm like, Oh really?

13
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.070
How did you figure that out? Cause his eyes all caked up. Why,

14
00:00:46.071 --> 00:00:47.000
why why'd you figure that out?

15
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.770
Cause it's the only dog I've ever seen with conjunctivitis.

16
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.730
And um, and so they were like, just put these drops in it every three hours.

17
00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:59.300
And so I did and it moved to his other idea. Yes.

18
00:00:59.301 --> 00:01:03.080
Now it's in both eyes down. Stand on it,

19
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.880
stand in it. We need a little Lele. Oh dude. And that wasn't it.

20
00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:12.080
So we started putting the drips in the second eye and then guess what dude? Oh.

21
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.360
Yeah, dude. It spread to his nose. How did it do it?

22
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.660
Hey, stop moving the light around, down there. Um,

23
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.990
and how did it spread to his nose dude?

24
00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:26.270
His nose looks like a Barnicle,

25
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.630
so that's bad.

26
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.960
So it looks like some barnacles and his eyes look like they're

27
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.900
kicked up, kicked up eyes and nose Barnicle

28
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.880
and uh, so it looks really bad. So anyway,

29
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.150
taking him into the vet tomorrow and who knows if it's his last day or not?

30
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.670
In the meantime

31
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.120
trash dog Chen's uh, I talk about them. I still call them trashed dog on the,

32
00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.920
on the, on the Rogan podcast. He's always going to a superstar,

33
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.540
a superstar. Hey, could you be more distracting down there?

34
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.030
I mean, Jesus Christ. Um, I took trash dog to the, um,

35
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.040
to the vet because why? Well, I don't know.

36
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.010
We found this dog. I told you near target,

37
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.150
like it was shopping for some placemats or some,

38
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.610
uh, and went to, uh,

39
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.850
when w w uh, and, and so, I don't know, all of a sudden he started wincing and.

40
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.390
I think he was probably abused, but I'm a savior. So I keep them in Miami,

41
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.090
keep them nice. And I don't, you know,

42
00:02:41.091 --> 00:02:43.130
I keep them real nice and as frustrating as he is,

43
00:02:43.131 --> 00:02:47.540
because he everywhere and vomits everywhere. I still hold my cool. And I'm like,

44
00:02:47.541 --> 00:02:49.130
it's okay. It's okay.

45
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.050
And he barks and wakes the baby up and just everything do it. And I just go,

46
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.120
okay. All right. All right. Jen's it's not even his name. I made up a name for

47
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.200
trashed dog scraps, rat. Anyway, um,

48
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.170
runaway dude. So,

49
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.650
so one day he's, you know, you know,

50
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:16.210
a dog's in trouble when they're just like this.

51
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.753
<v 1>What.</v>

52
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.170
<v 0>When they look like a, uh, uh, um, uh, private, uh,</v>

53
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.161
when they look like Donnie,

54
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:28.980
Brasco the Johnny Depp at the end of the movie where he's like, no, no, no,

55
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.880
no. I'm a mafia guy. And they're like, what the?

56
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.500
You, you weren't aware what? Sorry.

57
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.840
Uh, mil I'm a dog. It's all good. ARF,

58
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.890
Ruff, Ruff, Ruff, Ruff Rover. Oh, a bone.

59
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.150
And, uh, guys in the van guys in the van just hearing are quieter. Huh?

60
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.770
Huh. Uh, and so, um, man, imagine being one of those guys in the van,

61
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:02.170
how important you feel and how dumb you look to,

62
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.720
because you're just so cooped up and you're,

63
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.170
and you're listening to the guy who was wearing a wire and you're in a flower

64
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:12.610
van. And, uh,

65
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.280
and so he was just chilling, not moving. And my girls,

66
00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:22.900
like it, it's something we it's weird. And I'm just like, Oh, for sake.

67
00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:26.830
Now you think something's wrong again? You know, I don't know. I don't know.

68
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.830
And I'm like, no, it's fine. You know, he's just a dog. He'll, he'll,

69
00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:33.340
it'll be fine. He's just being really weird. And I'm like, what do you mean?

70
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.130
And she's just like, I dunno. It's just like,

71
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.470
he's just like really like cautious. I'm like, all right. She's like, yeah.

72
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.890
I think it's like for no reason. And just, I think it's like neurological.

73
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.070
Oh, all right. Cause you're a vet dude.

74
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.520
Chicks will just make up, man.

75
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.790
I think it's a neurological thing. Y you know, if it just.

76
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.013
<v 1>Yes.</v>

77
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:08.160
<v 0>So I'm like, all right. So I take him to the vet</v>

78
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.700
and then like, he pulled his back. Oh, really? That's neurological.

79
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.930
So he pulled his back. So she, she gave the vet, gave him pills.

80
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.350
Now I've got to give him pills, every, however many hours.

81
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.460
And he's got like three pills. Like he's some 80 year old uncle.

82
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.730
And, uh, they're in these blue bottles

83
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.930
and I go to sleep. I wake up and I look and there's

84
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.170
pill, pill, bottles all over the living room floor. And I go, what the?

85
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.170
And they're empty, dude. And this dog,

86
00:05:46.171 --> 00:05:50.940
this trash dog ate 500 milligrams of whatever the

87
00:05:50.941 --> 00:05:55.260
hell retinol is called. Like, it was some Funyuns dude.

88
00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.110
And he's just, and I looked over him and he's just like this, but.

89
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.913
<v 2>Uh.</v>

90
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.230
<v 0>It's all good. I am a regular dog in the meantime.</v>

91
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:08.690
It's just ARF 20 minutes. Go by.

92
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.940
<v 2>Oh, [inaudible]</v>

93
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.360
rough. Rural

94
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.590
[inaudible] gunk.

95
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.900
<v 0>No, but he didn't. He was chilling and I'm like, all right, let's leave him,</v>

96
00:06:28.901 --> 00:06:32.640
dude. He made his bed. Do the dog ate 500 milligrams of retinol,

97
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.380
whatever the it's called and my girl's leg, will you say good?

98
00:06:35.381 --> 00:06:39.970
I got to take him in. And I'm like, dude, we found the dog. If he,

99
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.810
it was like the end of the Rocky where Dolph Lundgren is like, if he dies,

100
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.580
he dies. That was me. I was duffle longer than my trash dog. And.

101
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.830
<v 2>I know you don't have a moral responsibility,</v>

102
00:06:50.831 --> 00:06:54.730
but I am a moral person and I am a moral and moral and I'm a mortal.

103
00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.340
<v 0>And so I was like, all right.</v>

104
00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.840
So now I got to take the trash dog to the

105
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:06.340
vet, to the animal hospital, which is by the way, you're a real.

106
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.580
And I'm just like, at least, no one's gonna be at the animal hospital.

107
00:07:09.581 --> 00:07:13.060
Maybe the vet's closed. But dude, the animal hospital, the line was longer than

108
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.430
in and out. It was longer than what was the Christ chicken?

109
00:07:18.431 --> 00:07:22.300
What's that place called the Christ chicken place? The,

110
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.050
the place where they don't, they don't believe in gays. What the is it?

111
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.120
Chick-fil-A those

112
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:35.050
so scared of Cox and buts. Anyway, chick, it was the,

113
00:07:35.051 --> 00:07:37.750
like the line for Chick-fil-A and I got to go and I got park and now I'm waiting

114
00:07:37.751 --> 00:07:42.490
again, my dog butters with the pink eye and barnacle nose at home. Just like,

115
00:07:42.491 --> 00:07:46.630
I wonder where the trust dog went. And, and my dog is just,

116
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.490
and trash dog is just chilling in the, in the baby seat, behind my car.

117
00:07:51.491 --> 00:07:53.620
Just looking at me. I'm like, this is not for you. Get the out.

118
00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.690
Then the nurse comes with gloves in a mask. And she's like, is everything okay?

119
00:07:58.691 --> 00:08:00.970
I'm like, just take the dog and see what the hell is going on.

120
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.660
If he's alive or not. And they're like, well,

121
00:08:04.661 --> 00:08:07.360
we'd like to keep the dog for two days. I said, how much is that going to cost?

122
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.150
You? She's like, well, you know, you could take it for one day. And I said,

123
00:08:10.151 --> 00:08:14.410
how much is it going to cost? He said, we'll call you back. Call me back.

124
00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:17.080
It's going to cost four grand. Yeah,

125
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:21.820
four grand. Like it's some nice shoes.

126
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.730
Like it's a blazer. I got aware three times do it.

127
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:29.920
I'm not spending four grand on a dog. I found your target two months ago. Okay.

128
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:35.710
I already got barnacle knows costing me $800 on some eyedrops that don't work.

129
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:40.450
It's just making them worse. It looks like Matt Damon at the end of contagion.

130
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:45.970
And so now this dog, uh,

131
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.500
I got it. I'm like, no, bring the dog back. They're like, well,

132
00:08:50.501 --> 00:08:52.240
we don't recommend that. Well, I said, well really well,

133
00:08:52.241 --> 00:08:53.860
I recommend you giving me my dog back.

134
00:08:53.861 --> 00:08:56.640
So I bring the dog back and that was just chilling.

135
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.650
They give them some charcoal. I don't know what the,

136
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.440
like he was bad at Christmas and they gave him some charcoal and they ate it.

137
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.590
Yeah, out black charcoal. They literally, well, his duck,

138
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.800
if his poop is black, bring them in. And I said, you just give them charcoal.

139
00:09:09.801 --> 00:09:12.530
And they're like, well, okay, if it's black, like the next day, Hey,

140
00:09:12.531 --> 00:09:16.850
after the charcoal. And they're like, you have to bring them in the next day.

141
00:09:16.851 --> 00:09:17.840
And I'm like, I'm not doing that.

142
00:09:17.841 --> 00:09:20.450
And then you have to also bring them in on the 11th. I said, I'm not doing that.

143
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:24.290
So guess what? He's fine. Where is he? Where are the trash dog?

144
00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:31.040
Come here. [inaudible] come here. Come here, buddy.

145
00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:36.080
Let's make your debut here. Come here, come here buddy. Good boy. He ran away.

146
00:09:36.081 --> 00:09:39.350
All right. You know, you don't listen to me and you just eat pain meds.

147
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.590
Like they're Skittles. It's fine. It's fine. And uh, Andy,

148
00:09:45.591 --> 00:09:50.030
any day you don't even affect him, dude. He's so, he doesn't give a, dude.

149
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.930
He's like you think pain meds. me. I'm dog. No way, man. No way, man.

150
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:58.310
I eat trash. I straight up a lead, a milk carton without the milk in it, man.

151
00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:02.780
I don't give a dog when I leave your house.

152
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:07.490
And I run away. I eat all sorts of, leaves, trash,

153
00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:12.170
Dunkin donuts rappers. And also I channel changers.

154
00:10:12.171 --> 00:10:13.580
If I find that I don't give a man.

155
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:18.320
