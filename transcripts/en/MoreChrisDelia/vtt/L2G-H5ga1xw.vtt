00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.420
<v 0>Um, anyway, I got to get a turtleneck. That's the thing.</v>

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.240
You guys better believe I'm getting a turn. Like I'm not around too.

3
00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:09.210
I'm getting a turtleneck. I got to get one before it gets warm.

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.790
Cause I got to wear this turtleneck because dude, I'm going to look so,

5
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.720
sexy and a turtleneck. It's unreal, dude. I swear to God, you know what?

6
00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:20.310
As a matter of fact, yay, this week, I'm getting a turtleneck dude. This week,

7
00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:24.720
I'm getting a turtleneck and all you haters that think I won't can go kiss my

8
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.760
dude. I'm getting a turtleneck and it's going to come up to my jaw and bro,

9
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.650
it's going to make my mandibular pop out so hard. I swear to God,

10
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.390
you know what I'm gonna do. I'm getting a turtleneck.

11
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.200
But I also guess I gotta get towels because there's going to be chicks around

12
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.240
and I don't want their sweat,

13
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.750
the holes so much that they slip and fall and break their ankles.

14
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.940
Cause then I got a lawsuit, dude,

15
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.410
I'm going to get a turtleneck.

16
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.570
And then I'm going to get a bag of big towels and just pass them

17
00:00:57.571 --> 00:01:02.430
out. When I see chicks and she'll be like, why? Oh, I got it.

18
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.960
Why are you? And then see me about my popping.

19
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.040
Cause also I trim my beard to make it look like, Whoa, bro.

20
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:13.650
When I do a four or a five on the tremor and my,

21
00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:17.520
my jawline it's like, people are like, yo,

22
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.040
did someone draw that?

23
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.800
So I got now a turtleneck with a four or five trim and I'm going to be walking

24
00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:30.610
around town. Like it's legal dude. I've got a bag.

25
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.320
I'm going to get two bags. I'm gonna get a backpack. And two big Ikea bags of,

26
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.010
of towels. And whenever I see a chick, especially in a skirt,

27
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.080
I got to pass out a towel because I don't want her to break her ankles.

28
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.230
I don't want to do, I don't want to,

29
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.960
I don't want her to slam her tailbone on the conk. I don't want that.

30
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.600
Excuse me. Ma'am sorry. But I've got a turtleneck on. If I wear a turtleneck,

31
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.320
they'll let me in anywhere. Just so you know, just so you know,

32
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.670
they'll let me in anywhere, dude. That's how sexy I look. Oh.

33
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.043
And then this.

34
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.660
<v 1>Oops, oopsie.</v>

35
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.840
<v 0>Daisy, can you hear it on audio oopsy? Daisy,</v>

36
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.480
the heavy snake chain comes out halfway through the night.

37
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.340
I got to go get more towels. You understand me, dude? I swear to God, man,

38
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.680
put a turtleneck on my body. See what happens?

39
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.550
Put a turtleneck on my torso and see what happens.

40
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.090
<v 1>To me.</v>

41
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.380
<v 0>Putting it on like this and then folding it over.</v>

42
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.710
Whoops, me folding it over like that, putting it on. And then me putting it,

43
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.060
put it on like this,

44
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.940
putting it on like this and me folding over is when a guitar kicks me taking

45
00:02:41.941 --> 00:02:43.260
the. Cause it's not mocked. And just,

46
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.930
and then all of a sudden passing out towels, dude, here you go. Here you go.

47
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.350
And then chicks, Whoa and her. Cause I can't, it's it's a shame too,

48
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.363
because I can't get,

49
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.760
get towels out fast enough because when I'm in crowded places, girls are like,

50
00:02:56.761 --> 00:02:59.950
what the? And they fall and they fall casually. They, they become, you know,

51
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:04.780
they, they become casualties to my turtleneck game casualties to a turtleneck

52
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.900
game. That's what they become. And it's sad too, man.

53
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.060
But hopefully they were an idea. It's sad as. I'm sorry, sweetheart.

54
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:15.430
I tried to get over here as quickly as I could to get you a towel.

55
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.080
I know because I've got a turtleneck on,

56
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:20.020
it was really irresponsible and dangerous. I mean, but I,

57
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.490
and I also have a four or five on my trimmed beard, but it's really sad.

58
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.230
Here's an extra towel before you get up, put it down.

59
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.440
I don't want you to slipping and falling because you're putting gets so bad

60
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:36.300
because I've got to turtleneck on the run,

61
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.470
hustle away with my Ikea bags,

62
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.300
just making this noise,

63
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.850
running away with my two big Ikea bags and a turtleneck on with a heavy chain

64
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:53.200
out. Just slap it against my chest, dude. God, how sexy can you be?

65
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.560
I also got to be a, I also got a backwards hat. I don't call it a hat.

66
00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:03.640
I call it a backwards hat. I got a backwards hat.

67
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:07.570
I got a hat in Florida once and I wore it and it was so sexy and everyone was

68
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:10.420
like. You're so what's going on. You do things to me in this hat.

69
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.810
I had to get some towels and then I left the hat on the plane and then a few

70
00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:16.120
months went by. I'm more into the hat.

71
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.740
And then I was in Irvine today and I got an LA hat. So I'm I'm about to start.

72
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.440
man. It's too bad. A turtleneck with a, uh,

73
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.080
hat doesn't look good cause it doesn't because if it did,

74
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.600
they would call me population control. That's legit.

75
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.410
What they will call me because people would be slipping and falling and breaking

76
00:04:35.411 --> 00:04:39.220
their necks. Anyway, dude, I don't mean to brag,

77
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.630
but I'm extremely sexy in a turtleneck and a heavy chain peeking out.

78
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.530
And then also just with, I would have cool pants on too

79
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.240
little in then, then them,

80
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.330
he has a turtleneck and also a heavy sneaker chain that sometimes he takes out

81
00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.770
halfway through the night,

82
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.590
but also he's got two heavy Ikea bags with dozens of towels in them

83
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.000
just in case women get so wet while looking at him, noticing his,

84
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.010
his five, his number five razor shaped beard and,

85
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.280
and get so wet. And then the wet goes down their legs.

86
00:05:17.281 --> 00:05:20.640
If they're wearing a skirt and then they slip and hurt their tailbone,

87
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.800
that's when the Leah would come up and hand them a towel out of his Ikea back

88
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.790
and hope for the best. As he ran away,

89
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.820
giving out towels to women that saw him.

90
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.103
Wow,

91
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.190
well we started with some real poignant on this podcast and then turned into

92
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.900
some absolute ridiculous, but I told you it's a silly goose time, dude.

93
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.190
It's a silly goose time, dude. It's a silly goose time man,

94
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.500
and life rips, man.

95
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.910
Just remember even when celebrities die and ideas fade life,

96
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.090
you got to remember that, dude,

97
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.980
life continues to rip and it continues to rip and it continues to rip and it

98
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:06.080
continues to rip dude, I'm a preacher.

99
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.963
<v 1>Sure.</v>

100
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.870
<v 0>So go get your life rips merge. And you know,</v>

101
00:06:10.871 --> 00:06:14.350
I'm trying to make a dollar do it and it does whatever, bro. It don't worry.

102
00:06:14.351 --> 00:06:18.100
Don't get one man. It's an idea. Uh,

103
00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.190
Knows my schedule. You at coffee bean.

104
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.220
I have that shirt in my car and I'm headed there.

105
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.870
And then he writes me one at one 49 and then at one 52. Whoa, Holy.

106
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.890
It's closed forever. That's crazy. And then he writes,

107
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.240
I think maybe you're recording. So see ya. He knows it. He knows my business.

108
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:44.230
That's awesome, dude. This is the one dude. One fire just sent me this one,

109
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.000
this turtleneck dude. You know what I need to do? Wow. That's a good one. St.

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.620
Laurent cable roll neck knit. Oh it's only three 65. Oh wow. It's sold out.

111
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.650
Great. Can't get it. Yes, dude.

112
00:06:56.651 --> 00:07:01.180
I saw turtleneck the other day at a place and it was so popping and it was

113
00:07:01.181 --> 00:07:05.080
$3,000 and I was like, are you kidding me? Shore bags, but you're kidding me.

114
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.400
I was like, sure. Of course bank account slogan. But you're kidding me.

115
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.480
I was like, sure, God opened the windows to my house so the cash can breathe.

116
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.860
But 10 may, I was like, sure, I've got stacks. And if I lay down,

117
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:22.350
it looks like I've got three in my pants, but still, Hey Ken.

118
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:25.863

I'm getting a black turtleneck and y'all could go yourself for real and put that

123
00:07:41.771 --> 00:07:43.750
on my tombstone when I die for real.

124
00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:47.530
And I know someone's going to Photoshop this, whatever do it. But when I die,

125
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.270
put this on my tombstone,

126
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.200

You know what I need to do?
