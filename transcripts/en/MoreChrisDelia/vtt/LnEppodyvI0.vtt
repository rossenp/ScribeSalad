he literally had nothing to do with it.

13
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.960
Michael Kane has a website. Wow. The official website of sir Michael Kane.

00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:28.080

30
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.060
He was in scrubs. What scrubs?

31
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.340
Although it scrubs a show on NBC, it was a big hit. Sam BC.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.550
Oh, it was a, it was on TV. What's TV.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.350
Hey, they're doing a movie called the Kingsmen.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.170
Although it would you want to hear what it's about? No.

37
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.990
W they want to fly you to, uh, I'll do it. Hey. Hey,

38
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.680
they want, Hey, they want you to be an interstellar. Obviously I'll do it.

39
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.380
I feel like in scripts, it just says Michael Caine. It doesn't even,

40
00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:54.930
and then they, and then they shoot it and then when they're shooting it,

41
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:58.920
they're like, Oh, let's have his name. Be Harry Brown. Let's have his name. Be

42
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.310
Hobbs. I mean, I just,

43
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.430
I turned on the prestige the other day. He's just, he's in that. Obviously.

44
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.350
Imagine having a movie called the prestige and Michael. Cane's not in it.

45
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.080
It's called the prestige agents. Yeah.

46
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.730
I heard there's a movie called the pre-stage. What?

47
00:03:23.731 --> 00:03:28.650
A blow LM or not in it. Oh, well, we'll get I'll do it.

48
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.490
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Just tell him, I'll do it. Well,

49
00:03:32.491 --> 00:03:35.310

50
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.640
okay. He'll the guy said he'll write it in. No. Uh,

51
00:03:41.641 --> 00:03:42.840
Michael Caine.

52
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.543
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

53
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.150
<v 0>How, how much has honestly,</v>

54
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.130
Michael Kane for real said like at this point,

55
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.010
how much has he honestly said what CNET,

56
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.040
how much has he honestly said that really? I,

57
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.410
I bet he said it seven times and I'm talking about when it first came out or

58
00:04:16.411 --> 00:04:19.950
whatever, and it always just internet. And then they were like, Oh,

59
00:04:19.951 --> 00:04:24.030
it's like a connected, a bunch of connected computers. And, um,

60
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.510
it's like a network and you can share like, uh,

61
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.570
communication and knowledge and all that. Oh, right.

62
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.780
And then like a week later he was like, yeah. You know,

63
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.600
I heard about this internet thing. What is it again?

64
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.990
And then that was his second time. And then they were like, Oh,

65
00:04:39.991 --> 00:04:43.410
it's the thing where the computers are. And it's like, Oh, right, right. Yeah.

66
00:04:43.411 --> 00:04:47.820
Yeah. Well, I, uh, they set me up with an and, and uh,

67
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.430
an ALO L account. And he was like, no, it's AOL, RA, RA, RA.

68
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.480
And then somebody, uh, and then like three days later, uh,

69
00:04:57.481 --> 00:05:02.070
he heard about AOL and he was like, Oh, is that that thing? That's um,

70
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.350
w w computers and they're like, what? And then, like, what was it cold?

71
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.820
And he's like the, the, the internet. And he's like, yeah, yeah. What is that?

72
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.690
And then he's like, Oh yeah, it's like the computer. And then like,

73
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.950
so he kinda knew what it was,

74
00:05:16.951 --> 00:05:21.120
but then like a few years later he just stopped using it, you know?

75
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.870
Cause it was like 93 and he was like, just doing,

76
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.260
uh, Mr.

77
00:05:31.261 --> 00:05:35.820
Destiny and noises off and the movie blue

78
00:05:35.821 --> 00:05:40.750
ice and the Muppet Christmas Carol and, and,

79
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.630
and, and, and then,

80
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.670
and then, he did them in and then, and then,

81
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.730
and then he forgot and then someone was like, I'll email it to you.

82
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.620
And he was like, well, he's da. They were like, what's what?

83
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.370
And they're like email. And they was like, Oh, it's like a, I don't know,

84
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:04.640
do you have an AOL? And he's like, Oh yeah, I'll call [inaudible].

85
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.150
And they're like, no, it's AOL. And he's like, what would I call that?

86
00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:10.520
And they're like, you mean the internet? And he's like, Hey, what is that?

87
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.300
And that was like the fourth time or third or fourth time.

88
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.270
And then it just happened a few, like a few years after that.

89
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:18.860
And then like the last time he did,

90
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:21.980
it was like in 2011 was like the seventh time.

91
00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.770
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

92
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.320
<v 0>Somebody was like, you know, you should get a website. I mean,</v>

93
00:06:29.321 --> 00:06:33.730
I know you have like, have great career everything, but like.

94
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.160
<v 1>You know, the.</v>

95
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.700
<v 0>You know, it'd be cool. Like Gnomeo and Juliet is coming out.</v>

96
00:06:39.701 --> 00:06:42.550
And you're obviously a voice in that because they would never make that movie

97
00:06:42.551 --> 00:06:47.110
without you doing the voice because there's somebody called Lord RedBrick in it.

98
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.980
So, you know, and you said,

99
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.750
you'll do it so before cars,

100
00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.490
two goes into production because you're obviously going to play fin

101
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.750
missile. Again.

102
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.930
<v 1>You should probably get a website. And he said, Oh,</v>

103
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.093
like, it's.

104
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.490
<v 0>It's a, you know, a homepage that you could have on the internet. And he said.</v>

105
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.160
<v 1>I swear to gods.</v>

106
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.160
<v 0>That happened seven times.</v>

107
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:55.270
Well, every whatever helps, you know? And then they were like, yeah, well,

108
00:07:55.271 --> 00:07:57.130
you can have things on there. Like, you know,

109
00:07:57.131 --> 00:08:01.510
you have my Michael Kane news that people will go to.

110
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.580
And by this time it was like way too late for a

111
00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.220
website anyway, because like, everyone has Instagram and like that.

112
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:13.000
And go back up, go back up and you'll have all the home for all your.

113
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:18.340
And you know, you have like, you go to the website, it'll be Michael caine.com.

114
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.660
And you have the Michael Kane news and you'll have Michael,

115
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.220
can you have like a biography about,

116
00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.860
and then don't have a place to go for a filmography,

117
00:08:26.861 --> 00:08:28.990
even though nobody will check it. Cause I am DB exists.

118
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.960
And then we'll have like a place where you can brag about like your

119
00:08:31.961 --> 00:08:35.170
achievements. And he's like, Oh, Donald LA bragging. And it be like, no, well,

120
00:08:35.171 --> 00:08:38.650
you don't actually have to do it. We'll do it. And then, you know,

121
00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:39.720
we'll have like your,

122
00:08:39.721 --> 00:08:43.570
your timeline and then there'll be cool because we'll be able to put your books

123
00:08:43.571 --> 00:08:46.510
on there, which nobody even knows that you have. But you have obviously,

124
00:08:46.511 --> 00:08:49.690
because you're 90 years old and you definitely wrote some books because you too

125
00:08:49.691 --> 00:08:52.150
famous because people who are 90 years old and that famous,

126
00:08:52.151 --> 00:08:55.150
obviously have a written books.

127
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.470
And then also we'll put up a gallery and we'll put your favorite pictures on

128
00:08:58.471 --> 00:08:59.304
there.

129
00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.940
<v 1>And he says, and then,</v>

130
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.020
and if you go to Michael Cain's gallery,

131
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.340
it's got

132
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.260
pictures in it,

133
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.170
go to Michael KAnsal website and go to,

134
00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.280
he's got to

135
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.290
come on.

136
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.060
And one is of course of him in black and white,

137
00:09:53.061 --> 00:09:56.720
because he's been alive since cameras existed.

138
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:06.260
<v 0>Michael, can you send us your favorite pictures? I'll do it.</v>

139
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.620
Can you send us your favorite pig? I'll do well.

140
00:10:12.621 --> 00:10:17.360
I'll have two favorite pictures. Oh cool. Can you email it to us? Well,

141
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.720
nevermind. Just I'll come over and get them and scan them.

142
00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:25.940
What scan and nothing. It's fine. You can get it through the internet or

143
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.420
I'm not going to ask what that is, but I think, uh,

144
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.470
I think on Noah is because that was the seventh time.

145
00:10:33.471 --> 00:10:34.370
That was the last time he did it.

146
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.433
<v 1>Oh.</v>

147
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.590
<v 0>Gallery, dude. How funny is it?</v>

148
00:10:39.591 --> 00:10:43.010
When somebody has a gallery on their website and it has two pictures,

149
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:49.070
one picture is a fear and then it's got different faces of him,

150
00:10:49.071 --> 00:10:53.540
like throw out the years. But not really though. It's kind of only like, well,

151
00:10:53.541 --> 00:10:56.660
I guess one is in his twenties and one's maybe now, now ish,

152
00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:01.130
but then will the other ones of him getting his hair cut? Like what is that?

153
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.980
It's still from movie, I guess, right. Has to be,

154
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.600
Oh God who put this website together, dude,

155
00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:11.600
Ray, Charles

156
00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:20.330
Finn, missile. That's like so offensive,

157
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:24.200
you know? Yeah. We'll get Michael Kane to do it. Obviously.

158
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:29.390
Why that's fin missile? What is that? What couldn't be found?

159
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.393
Oh great.

160
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:36.410
Michael Kane has a thing on the bottom of his West side website that says useful

161
00:11:36.411 --> 00:11:39.800

162
00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:46.910
Uh. I'm sweating. I'm laughing so hard. Oh. That.

163
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:50.690
That is the hardest I've laughed on the website on the podcast website.

164
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:55.320
Oh my God. Oh my God.

165
00:11:55.380 --> 00:12:00.240
I mean the movies this guy's been in And the movies,

166
00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:04.950
the movies that sound like movies, he would be in are unbelievable.

167
00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.360
The quiet American of course Michael Kane would be in that. The actors,

168
00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.990
of course, Michael Kane would be in that second, second

169
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:21.750
Secondhand lions course. He'd be in that freedom of history of us.

170
00:12:21.751 --> 00:12:26.220
Of course he'd be in that. Do it.

171
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:30.120
My producer is surfing around on this guy's website,

172
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:34.350
Michael Caine's website. And it literally,

173
00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:39.780
I mean, what the? How is that? The quote? Okay.

174
00:12:39.781 --> 00:12:44.190
So Michael Kane is called the elephant to Hollywood, by the way,

175
00:12:44.191 --> 00:12:48.450
did he write this book? Maybe not whatever.

176
00:12:48.451 --> 00:12:52.110
It's a book about him. It's an autobiography.

177
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:56.670
<v 1>So we did all right. The quote.</v>

178
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.420
<v 0>You know, I like, there's a quote.</v>

179
00:13:00.421 --> 00:13:04.920
That's like the best book I've ever read or like one of the top

180
00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:10.710
autobiographies of this generation. The quote that they're,

181
00:13:10.711 --> 00:13:15.600
promoing this book to get you to want to read it. I, you're not on the,

182
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.350
on the website is, and I quote

183
00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.330
of very British star,

184
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.940
a very British star.

185
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:36.510
What the is that his name? Oh my God.

186
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.700
His real name is well. Okay.

187
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.480
I mean, his real name is more British than fin,

188
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.450
missile and Lord,

189
00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.770
whatever it was you could is his real name is so British.

190
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.130
You could put Lord in front of it and it would make it less British.

191
00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:03.660
His name could be London, Manchester,

192
00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:07.590
and it would be less British than this. This is his real name.

193
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.180
Maurice Mikel white.

194
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.540
It's been a long journey for Maurice Mikel, white,

195
00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:21.270
born with rickets and London's poverty stricken,

196
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.910
elephant and castle to the bright lights of Hollywood.

197
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:27.330
The most British sentence of all time. Rick gets, you know.

198
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:30.533
<v 1>Rick.</v>

199
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:35.100
<v 0>It's in London's poverty stricken, elephant and castle.</v>

200
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:38.850
What is it? What is it?

201
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:43.380
<v 1>Oh my God dude.</v>

202
00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:48.240
<v 0>And the P the picture of him on this foe of him pointing</v>

203
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:51.090
Michael Kane, the elephant to Hollywood,

204
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:55.550
the autobiography and the picture of him. Why would you, if you're Michael Kane,

205
00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:01.220
why would you write a book? I mean, I understand people might want to read it,

206
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:06.320
but why do you give a? I don't understand.

207
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:10.100
I don't understand a very British star.

208
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:15.470
It's the thing that they have in quotes. What was the,

209
00:15:15.471 --> 00:15:16.730
is that another book down there?

210
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:20.990
He wrote another book he wrote,

211
00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:26.510
he wrote two autobiographies. Hey man, wait til later.

212
00:15:26.511 --> 00:15:28.220
And the right only one.

213
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.160
And also this is the most British quote they're trying to preserve charm and

214
00:15:34.161 --> 00:15:36.740
humor of natural Rick contour.

215
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.290
And guess if humor has a U in it,

216
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.550
Maurice Mikel white. You bet.

217
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.060
Look at how they try to make it. Oh, another one to come on, dude.

218
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.810
It's not autobiography. Thank God.

219
00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:01.130
Oh, wow. Is there more? There's not more because I've got three books. Okay.

220
00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:05.450
I mean, who gives a? These guys who write books? It's like it doesn't,

221
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:09.740
I don't understand. You make what? A million dollars, what?

222
00:16:09.741 --> 00:16:12.770
This guy's got to have 35 houses.

223
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:21.830
I mean, what's he worth? Oh, cool.

224
00:16:21.831 --> 00:16:26.600
He's worth $75 million. Cool. Hey,

225
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:31.280
you were seventy-five million dollars. Don't write a book. The,

226
00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.340
dude, if I'm worth 75. No. How much of that is,

227
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:39.230
is his book $360,000 guarantee it. If that,

228
00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:40.040
if that.
