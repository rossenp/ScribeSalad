00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.840
<v 0>Uh, yes. Let me tell you this story. Since I cliffhanger last time,</v>

2
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.350
uh, when I myself at this all grand dude,

3
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.760
I actually didn't actually didn't cause I told the Freddy Cruz story twice in

4
00:00:16.761 --> 00:00:19.280
this podcast already where the, where I, I, I,

5
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.370
I took a dump in my red shorts at Chris Siegel's house because I was scared

6
00:00:22.371 --> 00:00:26.660
because Freddie was going to get me, dude. I was at,

7
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.850
uh, I went to go to

8
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.880
my cousin's bar mitzvah.

9
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.330
He's like the only Jewish kid in our family. So I felt like I should go.

10
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.810
I want it to support him. My family was there, flew to New York.

11
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.460
The bar mitzvah was in New Jersey,

12
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.300
flew to New York because I was on the road already.

13
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.950
And I was going to meet my, remember I was married,

14
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.080
my ex wife. I was like 20 six. I was going to meet her there. Uh,

15
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.250
and I was staying at the Soho grand for one night before she got there or

16
00:01:07.251 --> 00:01:11.600
something. And anyway, I felt good. You know,

17
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.310
married guy out on the town, got to New York, early, nothing to do.

18
00:01:16.311 --> 00:01:17.390
I was on the road.

19
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.250
Didn't have a show that night woke up early feeling good, dude.

20
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.510
You know, when you're jet lagged,

21
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.080
you go from West to East and you wake up early or, or,

22
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.810
or if you go East to West to wake up early, whatever it is, you know,

23
00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:33.680
you're all up. I went from West to East. I woke up early. I was like,

24
00:01:33.681 --> 00:01:37.490
you know what? I got enough sleep. I'm fine. Let's do this. Get up.

25
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.490
I'm just going to walk around. I went to college here for a year.

26
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.250
So I was going to walk around and look at the area. Hadn't been there for a bit.

27
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:46.791
Uh, I'm feeling good.

28
00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:49.670
It was one of those times where you wake up and you're just like, you know,

29
00:01:49.671 --> 00:01:53.180
you wake up sometimes. And just so

30
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.610
I see a few blocks down, one of those bagel place,

31
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.630
like those like carts that sell bagels and eggs and bacon and.

32
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.400
And I go one, please

33
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.530
eat it. Keep walking as I'm walking to meet in it.

34
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.660
I see another cart coffee. Hey, look, it's got cool coffees.

35
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.910
Maybe it was a, actually it was like one of those bud.

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.680
They are like a little half store. And I say one, please.

37
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.020
No, I'm eating the bagel and I'm drinking the coffee and I'm,

38
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.080
and I'm walking and I'm taking a walk and it's, it's still early.

39
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.850
The streets aren't even bustling yet, but the sun is out now.

40
00:02:37.851 --> 00:02:38.690
I'm keep walking.

41
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.670
I took my last but last sip of coffee and I feel

42
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.360
real hole on the top of my stomach. Now that's fine.

43
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.020
Sometimes your stomach just goes on. All right.

44
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.280
But I keep walking because there's nothing. If I need,

45
00:02:55.281 --> 00:02:59.950
I can go to the bathroom in one of these places, it's all good. Keep walking.

46
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.203
And all of a sudden,

47
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.250
I feel now the first time I felt rule the second time I felt

48
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.080
roll, roll, roll, roll. There were double ROS. Okay. It was like,

49
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.400
Oh man, maybe I should go to the bathroom. Nah, kept walking.

50
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.200
Okay. Also there's bathrooms everywhere.

51
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.940
It's New York city. So now I'm like, ah, you know what?

52
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.850
I actually don't really know what's up.

53
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.870
And my stomach doesn't really feel too well. So I'm like,

54
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.390
I'm just going to turn around what they were going to do in any way. You know,

55
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.390
I'm just going to walk back. Where am I going? I'm just chilling.

56
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:36.760
I'm just going to walk back. So I start to walk back.

57
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.430
And as soon as I pivot to walk back, I feel [inaudible] rural or, or,

58
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.660
or that's much longer than the first one. So I think, well, I know what I'll do.

59
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.830
I obviously I've got to go to the bathroom. I'll walk back to the hotel.

60
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.170
I'll go back. I'll go to the bathroom at the hotel.

61
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.220
And if I need to I'll stop before that in one of these great,

62
00:03:57.221 --> 00:03:59.500
fantastic shops that exist in New York city.

63
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.200
So I'm walking and walking and the contractions are happening,

64
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.000
you know, closer together. I'm walking,

65
00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:12.610
taking a few steps pretty soon. That

66
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.590
turns into a little bit of a hello. Oh,

67
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:20.860
okay. I'm like, ah, well, you know what?

68
00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:24.790
I'm actually going to try and find a spot to just unload.

69
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.373
You know what I mean?

70
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.080
So I try to get into this one place. It's close. I'm like, whatever. Oh.

71
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.090
I see it's closed. Oh, all right. Well, it. Keep walking, keep walking.

72
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.200
And I realized that this is where I get mad because it's New York city.

73
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.730
Nothing's open. It's too early, but it's New York city though, dude.

74
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.080
So in my head, not only is law going on, but also I'm like, dude, this is newer.

75
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.000
I'm going to have a look at this New York city.

76
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.240
And none of these places are open. It's 8:00 AM.

77
00:04:55.241 --> 00:04:58.120
Why are none of these places open? I gotta unload.

78
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.090
So now I'm like,

79
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.040
well at least I have the hotel I can get back to. And I'm I start thinking, man,

80
00:05:06.041 --> 00:05:10.180
is this too far away? Dude is my going to give out?

81
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.860
Or the Levy's going to break?

82
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.013
<v 1>Okay.</v>

83
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.060
<v 0>So I start walking fast</v>

84
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.310
and now I'm like, where's the place I got to go.

85
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.573
I'm like,

86
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.700
do I go slow enough to check and see if places are open or

87
00:05:32.701 --> 00:05:36.870
do I hit a full sprint and just hope to get back to the hotel. And I don't know.

88
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.740
So I check one more place. It's closed. And that's when I decide Chris,

89
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.350
it's going to be the hotel. You understand? And I hit a full splint sprint.

90
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.510
I hit a full sprint back to the Soho grand and I'm far from it.

91
00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.970
And I'm getting, and there are times too where I'm like, Holy.

92
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.500
I don't know if I'm going to make it. I'm clenching so hard.

93
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.290
I get to the soul grant. As soon as I see the Soho grand machine, it starts to,

94
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.320
I start to open up. I'm like, Oh, this is not going to be good. Okay.

95
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.270
I think the hotel elevator better beyond the

96
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:21.590
floor that I'm on because if I have to wait for it, oopsy, Daisy.

97
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.780
Okay. So I get to the elevator,

98
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.670
the doors open. I don't even hit it. I'm like, thank God people are in it.

99
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.070
They get out. I get on, I hit the button

100
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:40.400
as I'm going up in the elevator to my floor. I'm unbuckling my pants.

101
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:45.740
I can't, I can't spare any second. All right.

102
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.550
The door opens and my, my underwear is that I'm I'm if someone's there,

103
00:06:52.551 --> 00:06:55.580
I don't give a. You know, imagine someone at the door open all of a sudden,

104
00:06:55.581 --> 00:07:00.290
I just wanna move Rob and just all over everywhere. That'd be amazing for them,

105
00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:04.730
for them to tell that story. Anyway, I run down the hall to,

106
00:07:04.731 --> 00:07:09.200
I get my key out. I'm running down, holding my pants. I unlock the door.

107
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.320
Now this is the part dude.

108
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.320
There's in the room.

109
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:20.210
There's a hallway to the bedroom that goes to the right

110
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.450
past this like final four foot hallway is the

111
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.500
bathroom door. Okay. Now, if I'm looking at the, if I'm open,

112
00:07:30.501 --> 00:07:33.650
if I'm opening the bathroom door or if I'm opening the hotel door,

113
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:39.260
there's the hallway. I have to step through that. That goes, uh,

114
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.190
uh, perpendicular to the where I, how I'm facing.

115
00:07:43.191 --> 00:07:45.080
I don't have to run down the hallway. I have to cross all the way.

116
00:07:45.081 --> 00:07:48.080
You see what I'm saying? And then there's the bathroom.

117
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:53.150
And the bathroom is set up to where the toilet is to the, if I'm looking at it,

118
00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:57.350
the toilets on the left and it's facing out towards the right. Okay.

119
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.760
So picture the toilet's not facing me.

120
00:08:01.761 --> 00:08:04.250
It's on the left and it's facing to the right. Okay.

121
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:09.380
So I have already worked out that I'm going to take off my pants

122
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:14.720
and I'm going to do a spin move and,

123
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.530
and sit on the toilet. And as I'm sitting on the toilet,

124
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.100
I'm going to let loose. Okay.

125
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:27.380
So I see that as soon as I see the toilet, the plan is because you know,

126
00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:30.740
when you see a toilet and you got to go, you're going to go, right?

127
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.850
So I decide that, Oh, it's coming out.

128
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.200
I do a even quicker spin move and like a

129
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:40.670
Gatling gun.

130
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:45.590
It just rather that pap pap hits all the side of the wall.

131
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:50.483
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

132
00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:57.520
<v 0>Those guns that with the circles, you know, [inaudible].</v>

133
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.200
<v 1>Like that.</v>

134
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.790
<v 0>Trying to get the predator. And it just covers the</v>

135
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.610
and I sit on the toilet. Most of it gets in the toilet and I just go.

136
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:11.833
<v 1>Uh.</v>

137
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:15.290
<v 0>And I never felt better, dude relief, bro.</v>

138
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.770
And then I cleaned it up and that was the most.

139
00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.093
<v 1>I'm just.</v>

140
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:30.110
<v 0>Dude. It was the worst. It was the worst office. So good.</v>

141
00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:35.090
When you go doesn't it, it feels like whoever you voted for,

142
00:09:35.091 --> 00:09:39.020
for president one, that's what it feels like.

143
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:43.160
You're just like, Oh, make America great again.
