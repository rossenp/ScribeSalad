00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.990
<v 0>All right, Kyle Potter, there you go. At K Potter. 15.</v>

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.670
Good congratulations. How? Oh, you know what? He brought up. It's not at all.

3
00:00:08.671 --> 00:00:11.370
Actually, this guy doesn't know what, how, how much is it? The star receiver,

4
00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:13.950
Antonio predominant red tire for camera's all that is not pitch at all.

5
00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:15.300
You don't understand what pitches now, listen,

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.760
that makes you want to talk about it though.

7
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.170
That is legitimately my favorite thing that's happened to all month

8
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.030
that Antonio Brown,

9
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.560
Antonio Brown said he won't bro.

10
00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:31.470
It's so funny to see, this is what I was just talking about about,

11
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:33.360
I don't care what you believe, but I care how you believe it.

12
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.630
He said, I guess they changed the rules on the helmets.

13
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.610
I don't know why probably a money thing,

14
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.850
even though they're pretending like it's a safety thing. Um,

15
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.610
but he says no football without a wide receiver

16
00:00:52.611 --> 00:00:54.620
entered a Britta. Brown has told the Oakland Raiders,

17
00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:57.050
he will not play football again, unless he could wear his old helmet.

18
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.030
Lee starts to tell ESPN on Friday,

19
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.360
Brian had a two hour conference call with an independent arbitrator on Friday.

20
00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:05.270
Sources had to argue why he should be allowed to wear his ten-year-old helmet.

21
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.790
He is thought to have been using the same helmet. His whole career.

22
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.840
The arbitrator for the grievance call was joined by league officials,

23
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.970
play representatives, yada yada yada Brown wants to wear the helmet.

24
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.900
He prefers not one of the newer model helmets that league rules,

25
00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:26.270
mandate league sources set. Uh,

26
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.950
Brown believes that the new believes the new certified helmet protrudes out and

27
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.430
interferes with his vision. As he tries to catch a football.

28
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.210
Now that's an actual legit grievance. Okay. But this is just, it.

29
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.980
It's just great. The way he,

30
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.160
the Raiders have been sending Brown, other approved helmets to wear.

31
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.320
But at this time he is not interested in wearing any of them. That's hysterical.

32
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.430
Okay. That he takes to helmets, puts them on and goes. Nope, not that one.

33
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.560
And keeps putting on helmets. Nope. Not that one.

34
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.630
Brown appeared to refer to an internal debate about walking away from the

35
00:02:02.631 --> 00:02:07.250
football by posting Friday and Instagram caption, paraphrasing, the two painful,

36
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.283
um.

37
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.210
<v 1>Something made me laugh here.</v>

38
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.110
<v 0>He just like, they keep like, okay. Yeah, this is what I read is that he keeps,</v>

39
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.620
they keep sending him things, football helmets.

40
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.380
And he keeps thinking he doesn't like them.

41
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.010
And then he eventually got fed up and said, you know what?

42
00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:36.140
I'm going to wear the old one or I quit, dude.

43
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.740
That's so talk about

44
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.710
Beats. That's so dope. That's hilarious.

45
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.110
Don't wanna, anytime an adult reaches that don't want to level I'm in,

46
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.890
I'm in dude, you're invited to the log cabin.

47
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.760
Antonio Brown don't wanna

48
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.200
that's so dope to be that much of a child as an adult.

49
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.090
That's what I want. That's what I am.

50
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.760
Don't wanna put $6 million next year. Can I wear the helmet?

51
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.090
No, keep it don't wanna.

52
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.430
I did poop in my pants. That's so funny to me.

53
00:03:26.431 --> 00:03:29.280
I love him. Now. I'm a big fan of him. Don't even know what he looks like.

54
00:03:29.281 --> 00:03:31.110
Don't care. I'd CA I'm going to,

55
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.740
I want to go out on a date with him straight up a heterosexual midday date,

56
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.950
where we go and we see the art of racing in the rain and we just chill where you

57
00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:40.310
popcorn. I'll pay for all of the or he can pay for it.

58
00:03:40.311 --> 00:03:43.500
If he feels more comfortable, I'll be the girl kind of, or the like whatever.

59
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.440
Doesn't have to be about gender, but I can be the, you know, the lesser one.

60
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.520
Not that girls are lesser, but you know what I mean? Not that guys are lesser,

61
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.290
but you know what I mean? It's like record your vase.

62
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.040
The one who takes it is what I mean in that whole exchange.

63
00:03:56.041 --> 00:03:59.100
The one who gets is obviously the less powerful one is all I'm saying.

64
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.340
Okay. I guess I've never running for president, but you know what, though?

65
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.020
I am the president. So kiss my.
