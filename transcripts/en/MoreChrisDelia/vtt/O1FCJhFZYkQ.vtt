00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.620
<v 0>Did you see? Uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.870
I can't even tell you how much I thought about

3
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.130
kid rock tweeting to a Taylor Swift.

4
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.630
I just can't tell you how much I've thought about it. It's so weird.

5
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.990
It's weird. How much a political, like a political stance can divide your fans.

6
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.040
Like somebody I was talking about guns and, and somebody was like, I mean,

7
00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:33.710
every time I tweet and it's not that to me, that's not even a political thing.

8
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.690
Like if just people are dying,

9
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.530
you got to fix the situation and people like stale set of politics, comedian.

10
00:00:39.531 --> 00:00:44.240
And I'm just like, I CA I don't know how to, um, I don't know how to do it.

11
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.230
You know, I just, whatever I read responded to some guy who was like, I'm the,

12
00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:51.860
if you think being political mean talking about people dying as being political,

13
00:00:51.861 --> 00:00:56.780
then I'm the vice-president because you got them right on political. And,

14
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.130
uh, so I, I, but,

15
00:01:00.131 --> 00:01:03.620
but the T the kid rock thing is just such a mess.

16
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.600
It's weird. This is like a guy like me who doesn't know about kid rock.

17
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.880
Like would, if, if I didn't know anything about him,

18
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.490
like, I don't care. Like,

19
00:01:16.491 --> 00:01:19.550
I don't care if you think that all Americans need guns.

20
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.010
I D I don't think that, uh,

21
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.630
that there should be automatic weapons for sale to civilian.

22
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.780
<v 1>Also. Here's the other thing, too, when people are like, yeah, well,</v>

23
00:01:29.781 --> 00:01:30.561
the government, you know,

24
00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:33.320
this rule was put in place where the government cannot be. Dude,

25
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.960
the government can Nuchia

26
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.780
you think you're going to hold off the government with an assault rifle.

27
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.430
They got nukes. Do you know what that, what also?

28
00:01:46.431 --> 00:01:48.710
They have more people

29
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.660
did. Oh, Oh yeah, dude. Hey, keep your,

30
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.790
yeah. Keep the government away of your, uh,

31
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.080
from your townhouse with an AK 47 and 32

32
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:05.210
bullets. But you know what?

33
00:02:05.211 --> 00:02:08.780
The government has more people, dude.

34
00:02:08.781 --> 00:02:12.950
They'll crash at tank through your townhouse.

35
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:15.643
[inaudible]

36
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.550
Like, what are you talking about? Yeah. Well,

37
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.470
I'm here for when the government tries to take over, it already took over.

38
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.090
They've got so many people. So that's a weirdest.

39
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.600
<v 0>Um, argument for me, that being said.</v>

40
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.010
<v 1>I, you know, security, have a guy with a gun in the Walmart,</v>

41
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.980
protecting everyone to have that. I don't, you know, whatever.

42
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.600
It's like that guy who 'em the other day, who who's,

43
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.410
who held the.

44
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.270
<v 0>Other guy at Bay.</v>

45
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.850
<v 1>Because he was security and he had a gun and he was holding the gun.</v>

46
00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.280
<v 0>Uh, and w w w who brought in an assault? Right? A rifle.</v>

47
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.730
I don't know where it was. You remember something like seven, 11?

48
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:04.570
I went with a nose.

49
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.280
<v 1>He held them. Good, good, good, good dude. Have armed guards around.</v>

50
00:03:08.281 --> 00:03:13.020
I don't give a, but like I saw that picture of a guy who had a,

51
00:03:13.021 --> 00:03:17.370
the assault rifle. And he was like in line at a coffee bean, like, dude,

52
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.260
leave it in the car.

53
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.410
<v 0>Somebody was like, would you be.</v>

54
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.360
<v 1>More scared or less scared.</v>

55
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.630
<v 0>If you saw this guy in the, in the coffee bean.</v>

56
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.110
Cause you know that he could protect.

57
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.300
<v 1>Hey, got the guy at Jane's on, you know,</v>

58
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.770
if you were in jeans, don't have an assault rifle,

59
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.720
dude wear cammo and be in the government or army.

60
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.360
It's so weird.

61
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.790
Tivy like inline with an assault rifle over your back.

62
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.650
And you're just like, yeah,

63
00:03:52.651 --> 00:03:56.160
let me get a anything.

64
00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.520
Oh, you got shy. Yeah.

65
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.670
<v 0>Don't come to me for political views too.</v>

66
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.650
<v 1>You're straight up. Like, well dude lost a podcast fan.</v>

67
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.070
I write at K you know,

68
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.070
side of the Nara dude.

69
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.070
<v 0>I told you silly goose time period. Um,</v>

70
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.690
but yeah, it's hilarious.

71
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.510
They're getting rid of video games and that movie, the hunt,

72
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.670
they canceled that crazy.

73
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.870
They canceled that. Universal canceled the movie, the hunt.

74
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.460
It was going to be out, put it up, bring it up in here. Uh,

75
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.570
it was going to be out and uh, they just gone.

76
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.640
Just gone because of how I guess universal

77
00:04:56.641 --> 00:05:00.930
cancels the hunt release, universal pictures, scroll up.

78
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.200
Universal speakers canceled the release of his upcoming thriller. The hunt.

79
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.040
The film was presented previously set to hit theaters September 27th when

80
00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:11.430
universal pictures had already paused the marketing campaign for the hunt.

81
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.140
After thoughtful consideration,

82
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.450
I get that the studio has decided to cancel our plans to release the film

83
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.540
I spokesperson for universal set it in a statement.

84
00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:24.540
We stand by our filmmakers and we'll continue to distribute films in partnership

85
00:05:24.541 --> 00:05:26.370
with the bold and visionary creators. Like those,

86
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.740
now's not the time to release this film. They're not going to release it.

87
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.690
That's the thing, dude, you know, on one hand, it's like sensor, you know,

88
00:05:39.691 --> 00:05:43.470
I get, I get being like sensitive and, but also that censorship,

89
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.400
it really is because Trump was saying, you know,

90
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.520
I loved the tweet too. That Trump did. It was just a mess

91
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.910
about it. He was just like, what did he say?

92
00:05:56.911 --> 00:06:01.670
Let look it up here. I'm. I'm. I'm. I can't get the code in. I'm. All good.

93
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:05.540
I can't get my code in. Uh, what did he say?

94
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.370
Oh yeah. He told me he, but he didn't say the tonight in it, dude.

95
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:13.490
He tweet so much. Dude.

96
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.700
Liberal Hollywood is racist at the highest level. Okay.

97
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.860
And with great anger and hate, they'd like to call themselves elite,

98
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.030
but they are not elite.

99
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.220
Now this is weird because like I'm in Hollywood and I've never heard

100
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:34.310
someone in Hollywood be like, you know, I'm elite.

101
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.190
They do. Yeah. They, yeah, exactly. They say that,

102
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:42.710
you know,

103
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.430
people are only saying the Hollywood elite when they're making fun of Hollywood,

104
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.190
like nobody thinks they're elite. Like who thinks they're elite?

105
00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:54.560
Unless you're like a soldier that went through training.

106
00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:01.490
You're not elite because you were in a what's that movie with

107
00:07:01.491 --> 00:07:05.390
Milo Ventimiglia and the dog. You're not elite.

108
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.380
Cause you're Jenna Elfman. You know, you're just in a, in some

109
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.780
elite, but he's right. They like to call themselves elite,

110
00:07:14.781 --> 00:07:15.650
but they are not elite.

111
00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:19.400
In fact it is imagined me thinking I'm elite because I was in the show, Whitney.

112
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.880
Well, you know, I'm a leak.

113
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.160
Cause I was in an episode of workaholics and Undateable.

114
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.740
In fact that is often the people that they strongly oppose that are actually the

115
00:07:30.741 --> 00:07:33.410
elite. Okay.

116
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.230
So now he's calling himself elite.

117
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:40.700
The movie coming out is made in order to inflame and cause chaos,

118
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:45.170
they create their own violence and then try to blame others.

119
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.850
They are the true racist and very bad for our country. I like how basic he gets.

120
00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:53.510
Sometimes they're very bad for our country. Like it's like,

121
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:58.670
like he's learning about it. And like he just figured it out there.

122
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.930
The true racist. I don't understand. He tweets a mess.

123
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:05.270
I don't understand how he's saying.

124
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.600
It's that, that makes them the true racists.

125
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.470
It doesn't have anything to do with race. Okay.

126
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.570
Speaking of which, did you see what Biden said about the

127
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:23.713
that whatever?

128
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:26.280
<v 1>Yeah. What a mess that.</v>

129
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:31.660
<v 0>Dude, he, I don't think that he, I don't know if he'll hold it together, man.</v>

130
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.610
Could he look more like a pilot that like doesn't fly anymore?

131
00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:44.380
<v 1>Poor kids are just as bright as white kids. Ah,</v>

132
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.030
major mistake.

133
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:48.160
<v 0>I.</v>

134
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.380
<v 1>Mean just major mistake.</v>

135
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:53.200
Imagine being up there saying that and then knowing you.

136
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:57.210
<v 0>Up, he, he tried make it better too, which was the best afterwards.</v>

137
00:08:57.211 --> 00:09:01.650
He goes like this poor kids are just as smart and talented as white kids.

138
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.010
And then he goes and black kids and Asian, whatever.

139
00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.670
<v 1>No, I tooted runs away.</v>

140
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:18.620
<v 0>And the massages girls' shoulders real quick. I don't know, but I didn't do it.</v>

141
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:20.870
I don't know. I mean, I don't,

142
00:09:20.871 --> 00:09:24.650
I don't know enough about anybody's policies because I'm a ignoramus,

143
00:09:24.651 --> 00:09:26.570
but that was like, Oh,

144
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:35.000
I mean, dude, that's so crazy.

145
00:09:35.001 --> 00:09:39.500
How that's the kind of thing that can ruin you, you know,

146
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:45.380
after that you think has done, he he's just, he's just up too much.

147
00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:52.710
Um, he just up too much. I don't know if he'd be good or bad, but I,

148
00:09:52.711 --> 00:09:55.010
I did like how he went bingo though.

149
00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:57.230
That's my favorite thing that any politician has ever done

150
00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:02.060
because every politician is like, well, you know, we don't want to do this,

151
00:10:02.061 --> 00:10:04.520
but we do want to do that. And so it's not a yes or no question,

152
00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:08.990
but they were like, so you want to take a take away assault, rifles, bingo.

153
00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:12.080
Like the like had a hard Dick when he said it.

154
00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.350
I love that. That's hilarious to me. I just love,

155
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.360
I kind of don't even care what you believe in.

156
00:10:20.361 --> 00:10:24.200
I love the way you believe in it is the best. Like,

157
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:32.060
but yeah, kid rock dude. When kid rock said the thing, uh, about,

158
00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:39.230
about, uh, about, um, uh, Taylor Swift,

159
00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.030
that's a mess too.

160
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.950
Taylor Swift wants to be a Democrat because she wants to be in movies period.

161
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:50.900
And it looks like she will suck the doorknob of Hollyweird to get their oldest

162

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.473
tweet the other day.

185
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:37.590
I can't think about how weird Chiraq suite was of all the things that we met on

186
00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:38.910
the road. You're mad that tells us what the Democrat,

187
00:12:38.911 --> 00:12:41.670
but then I realized this it's it's better than that.

188
00:12:41.671 --> 00:12:45.300
He thinks she's trying to get into movies by pretending she's a

189
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:50.280
Democrat dude. Like imagine her thought process. She's like, God,

190
00:12:50.281 --> 00:12:54.360
I really want to do movies. I bet I could get cats if I went yeah, blue.

191
00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.080
She's the biggest singer in the world.

192
00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:06.120
Also somebody tweeted after that, they were like, Hey kid rock. Are you jealous?

193
00:13:06.121 --> 00:13:10.800
Taylor Swift is in cats. That's so funny to think about kid rock being like,

194
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:15.570
Oh, like to watching the cats trailer and then having them be like,

195
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.220
Oh, off I made this movie without me, like,

196
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.730
and then saw Taylor Swift in it and then just is up in arms. Like.

197
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:27.540
<v 1>What the they call me kid rock.</v>

199
00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:34.860
<v 1>Are you mad? I guess.</v>

200
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:38.880
<v 0>That's the thing. When, when somebody says who's got a huge fan base is like,</v>

201
00:13:38.881 --> 00:13:42.480
okay, well them. Yes. Um,

202
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:49.920
know, now I got to speak out. Like you can just lose a lot of fans, I guess.

203
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.350
That's my favorite when people are just like, well.

204
00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:57.240
<v 1>Okay, I buy, I bought your last album. It's the last album years I buy,</v>

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.890
