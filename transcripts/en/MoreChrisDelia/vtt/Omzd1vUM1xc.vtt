1
00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.410
<v 0>You guys seen that, uh, first of all,</v>

2
00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:07.560
have you seen the, uh,

3
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.350
the Venmo or the, um, XXX pentacene thing?

4
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.710
Uh, I don't remember the names of either parties involved that started it.

5
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.480
I actually don't know if I knew some comedian named Dena made this joke or

6
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.520
Dyna made this joke on comedy central about the, uh,

7
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.110
slain rapper. And, uh,

8
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.540
it was a joke, you know,

9
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.030
and then I think James Davis comedian was comedian that originally

10
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.830
said this is offensive or something. And, um,

11
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.030
I don't really know enough about it,

12
00:00:47.031 --> 00:00:50.690
but I just saw that the fallout of it and everyone was like

13
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.870
outro. There were a lot of XXX,

14
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.700
10 Tassian fans that were sending death threats

15
00:00:58.701 --> 00:00:59.870
to the, the,

16
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.980
the comedian that did it and comedy central retracted it.

17
00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:05.750
And I guess apologized for it.

18
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.220
And the whole thing about the whole thing,

19
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.360
I just have to say no about the whole thing,

20
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.090
because here are the things. If comedy is comedy,

21
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.590
if there is comedy,

22
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.400
then you just you're allowed to just make whatever joke there is.

23
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.020
And you're just going to offend some people. And that's not a bad thing.

24
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.530
That's a good thing because that's what makes comedy comedy,

25
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.120
all jokes are offensive to somebody. Otherwise it's not even a joke, dude.

26
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.620
If I make a, if I make a joke about somebody's refrigerator, I say,

27
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.130
I just refrigerate. It sucks because of this, whatever, the Vulcan joke.

28
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.010
That's a hilarious joke by the way. But if it was even funnier than that,

29
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.060
somebody be like, ah, that's. That's my refrigerator go yourself.

30
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.600
It's because it's going to be offensive to somebody or the person's not going to

31
00:01:56.601 --> 00:02:01.220
give a, whatever, but it's like, you can't pick and choose,

32
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:02.751
especially as a comedian,

33
00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:07.550
you can't call out another comedian for making fun of first of

34
00:02:07.551 --> 00:02:10.850
all, it was a joke, regardless of whether or not you think it was good.

35
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.530
It was a joke. It was in joke form. I think the joke was something like, um,

36
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.420
rat, rapper, existent Tessio,

37
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.770
and God got killed for carrying $50,000 on his person.

38
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.180
I'm butchering the joke, but, uh, that's the best Venmo commercial ever, right?

39
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.610
Don't care where your cash is. Use Venmo, whatever the joke was.

40
00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:32.480
I don't know what it was funnier than that, but, um, yeah,

41
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.710
it does a joke and to say, Oh,

42
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.000
as a comedian, you can't. Yeah. You can't say that. that.

43
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.790
Then you're not, you're not really a comedian.

44
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.290
Uh, because you know what, I, I saw other people on, on Twitter as like,

45
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.760
yeah, it's the fact that it, wasn't funny. That's the offensive part.

46
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.800
You don't get to pick. You can personally say, that's not funny for me,

47
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.840
but if comedy Central's going to put something out there, they already did that.

48
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.630
You can't take it. Apparently they took it off the internet and they're like,

49
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:11.890
we're sorry. They're not, they're not, uh,

50
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.500
taking it off the internet because they're because of they're

51
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.720
taking off the internet because the mob is why they're taking off the internet.

52
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.760
That's not okay because people are going to be offended.

53
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.410
I mean, for sake, the joke really wasn't even that offensive.

54
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.970
If you said the about Michael Jackson, nobody would give a if he said the. And,

55
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.650
and, and,

56
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.460
and he's got all these alleged things about how he beat up his pregnant

57
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:42.640
girlfriend or whatever, you know, and you know,

58
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:45.040
I know it was never proven in a court of law, but neither was the Jackson.

59
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.790
But it's just like, why, you know,

60
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.390
it's because of his rabid fan base. I think, dude, let me just tell you.

61
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.130
If people make jokes about me, just if I ever get to the level where, you know,

62
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.120
people are just like slamming me or whatever, it's all good babies.

63
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.830
You don't need to tell people to go kill themselves. It's all good man. Jokes.

64
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.830
It's intent. It's this and that. I get it. But like, dude,

65
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.400
we're allowed to make all the jokes and we're allowed to go too far because

66
00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:18.730
that's how we figure out what jokes are funny. And that's how you keep pushing.

67
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.000
That's why stuff, listen, man, listen.

68
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.510
That's why stuff that was made in 1930.

69
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.620
Isn't funny anymore because we've advanced beyond that.

70
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.900
If you don't keep pushing the envelope,

71
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.530
we'll be stuck with Laurel and Hardy, dude,

72
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.980
they'll be trying to push a piano up the stairs. And we'll be like

73
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.730
the whole reason why funny now is because you have the people that will push

74
00:04:48.731 --> 00:04:49.930
that envelope.

75
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.410
And I'm not saying Laurel and Hardy, isn't funny, but we're past that dude.

76
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.110
We're past that because of people who make jokes like the one on comedy central,

77
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.740
whether you think it's funny or not, you have to figure it out.

78
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:06.574
You got to push it.

79
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.540
Otherwise you're going to be the Dick had that still laughing at,

80
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.120
you know, whatever it is in black and white at the thing,

81
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.040
dude stuff. Isn't funny 60 years later because of that.

82
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.330
So if you're, especially if you're a comedian, dude, go to war for the comedian.

83
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.690
I don't care if you like the guy's music. Look, I thought the guy's music,

84
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.420
I'm not a fan of the guy, but the guy's music was incredible. I liked his music.

85
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.540
You know, he's a talented guy.

86
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.070
You can't say he's not talented just because of what his person was like.

87
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:49.623
But dude,

88
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.830
the whole thing is insane.

89
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.440
I just, you know,

90
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.480
there's countless things in my set that could, you know,

91
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.530
catch fire and be like, ah, this is that they said this, that he said that,

92
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.620
but it's just the story of the day.

93
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.280
So shout out who was the comedian that said the joke, Dinah, what?

94
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.710
Dina Hasham. Don't worry. You know,

95
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.570
I know you're getting slaughtered by [inaudible] fans,

96
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:26.150
but it's going to be fine. You know,

97
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.520
it's so to tell people to go kill themselves online. It's so, dude,

98
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.800
grow the up, grow up.

99
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.870
And if you're 13 for real grow up because like, dude,

100
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:43.100
you're going to look back at yourself and you're going to be like, Oh,

101
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:44.120
I shouldn't have done that.

102
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.590
I'm a Laurel and Hardy watcher in 2019, dude,

103
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:54.050
go watch some Yuk. Yuks push a piano up a flight of stairs. You stupid.

104
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.870
That's a good, that would be a good insult in my head. If I was arguing with a,

105
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.170
you know, kick. But now I said it. So I can't use it anymore.

106
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.140
It's just like, dude, get it together, man.

107
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:16.340
It's so it's so annoying, dude. I tried to follow Dana on, on,

108
00:07:16.341 --> 00:07:19.760
on, on Twitter. So, you know, I had to ask,

109
00:07:19.761 --> 00:07:23.450
she cause you now she's private because she doesn't want people coming up to her

110
00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:27.380
saying, they're going to see people online saying, go kill yourself. Dude. Also,

111
00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:29.750
how about the fact that, Hey, don't,

112
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:35.270
don't make jokes about someone who is killed or will kill you.

113
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:41.620
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

114
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.550
<v 0>You idiot. Do you realize what you're doing? You dumb.</v>

115
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:56.230
You can. It's not America. If you can't say whatever you want to say, you know,

116
00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:00.340
I say this to my act. You can get mad at somebody for saying something,

117
00:08:00.341 --> 00:08:01.810
but you can't tell them not to say it.

118
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:10.090
Uh, so yeah, by the way, it was a Venmo joke. It wasn't a XX.

119
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.220
Exten Tachyon joke. It was a Venmo joke.

120
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.400
So you're getting offended at a Venmo joke. You.

121
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.010
You're getting offended at a Venmo joke. All good?

122
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:24.963
All good,

123
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:29.980
go watch some guys who looked different than each

124
00:08:29.981 --> 00:08:30.814
other.

125
00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.820
Push up a piano on a, on a flight of stairs.

126
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.180
You, you know.

127
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:45.363
<v 1>Which is so lame.</v>

128
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.870
<v 0>Got a hobby, got a sunglasses hut, get some,</v>

129
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.550
Arnett's put them on, get some gel

130
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.320
and go drive a Acura Integra around in 1998.

131
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:07.620
Now that's a slam. It's a lot of words,

132
00:09:07.621 --> 00:09:11.040
but it is a slam and you have walked into Denny's and I'm so sorry.

133
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:14.640
But all we have right now are the great a all American slams.

134
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.690
That's what we have. Here you go. Eat it while I go like this.
