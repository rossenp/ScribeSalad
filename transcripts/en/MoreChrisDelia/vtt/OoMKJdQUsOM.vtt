00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.450
<v 0>You gotta see this. This was a great one. This was sent to me by somebody.</v>

2
00:00:03.451 --> 00:00:07.590
I don't know, but this is the most up Instagram post.

3
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.840
<v 1>Oh no, no, it's up. It's the grand poster the week.</v>

4
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.150
<v 0>Okay, good. This one's great. I don't, I, you know,</v>

5
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.630
sometimes I don't do this most up Instagram posts of the week because it got

6
00:00:20.631 --> 00:00:23.570
kind of like, I did a lot of them and I was like, okay, where does it go?

7
00:00:23.571 --> 00:00:26.210
And whatever. And I know people love this segment and they keep hitting me.

8
00:00:26.211 --> 00:00:30.890
I'll get to [inaudible]. It will send me, pops up most up his grandpa's a week.

9
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.790
But this one dude, I was like, I got to do it. Okay.

10
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.160
So this is of a picture of a girl posing, hardcore, uh, at dinner,

11
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.870
she's got one of those stupid drinks that anyone would drink because softball

12
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.840
it's got like a drink with like a peel in it, you know, just have a drink.

13
00:00:50.841 --> 00:00:55.250
Don't put in it that I can't drink. So this girl is doing it.

14
00:00:55.251 --> 00:00:59.060
She's in a red dress. It's so photo-shopped the photo,

15
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.070
you know, a lot of makeup on this girl, but also photo-shopped okay.

16
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.280
And she's doing it like this. She's doing it like this.

17
00:01:07.281 --> 00:01:08.870
If you're on a video podcast, she's doing it like this,

18
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.020
like almost touching her hair kind of, but not touching her hair.

19
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.150
Cause it's sexy when you're kind of almost doing something,

20
00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:16.070
but not actually doing it. Right?

21
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.610
Like if you look at somebody from far away and you're like,

22
00:01:19.611 --> 00:01:22.730
is your mouth open or closed? You just get a bone doggy because of it.

23
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.020
Anyway, uh, here it, this,

24
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.600
this is the actual caption

25
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.630
I can tell how unintelligent a man is by how stupid he thinks I am.

26
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.560
First of all.

27
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.653
<v 1>Hat.</v>

28
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:39.171
<v 0>First of all,</v>

29
00:01:39.171 --> 00:01:43.010
the fact that you made this about men already is just amazingly genius.

30
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.230
You don't know it, but you accidental genius. Okay.

31
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.420
And also within the first line,

32
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.060
the only thing that we know is you're insecure. Okay?

33
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.673
That's it.

34
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.400
She writes the person you are looking at, first of all,

35
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.020
talking about it. Like it's not her, but it is her. Hey,

36
00:02:12.021 --> 00:02:16.430
are you Ricky Henderson? Then don't refer to yourself in the third.

37
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.350
As the person you're looking at,

38
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.130
Uh,

39
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.490
the person you were looking at has attended the best educational institutions in

40
00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:28.520
the world. Been top of the class,

41
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.410
all of her life smashed seven years of law school

42
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.420
and training to become a lawyer.

43
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.760
No lawyer has said I smashed law school unless also you're a guy.

44
00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:43.640
And you do date rape, um,

45
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.480
sailed through three wall street firms to date.

46
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.800
Sailed is exceptionally intelligent,

47
00:02:54.801 --> 00:02:57.830
intuitive and has worked very hard for everything. She's right.

48
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.830
Lee rightfully deservingly earned herself without relying on anyone

49
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:04.180
else. All right.

50
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.580
And we'll continue to accomplish greatness for many more years to come. I mean,

51
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:11.910
you don't know that who knows

52
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.920
could die. You know, if you happen to be mistaken,

53
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.950
expect this, this drives me nuts, dude,

54
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.650
queen to behave like a basic be first of all,

55
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.570
just say. Cause you're you. We know what it means. Second of all,

56
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:35.680
when, when women refer to themselves as queen,

57
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.460
dude, it's it's, it's so cringy.

58
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.440
It's like when a guy says he's the King, like,

59
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.210
like, I'm sorry, LeBron is the. But he goes by King.

60
00:03:54.211 --> 00:03:58.980
James is the worst

61
00:03:58.981 --> 00:04:02.160
dude. There's no King of basketball.

62
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.470
It's so cringy to me. Like I feel it in my heart.

63
00:04:07.471 --> 00:04:10.830
Like when, when people are like, Oh, that's a queen.

64
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.380
<v 2>Look at.</v>

65
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.850
<v 0>The way she ran her own clothing line. Queen,</v>

66
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.170
no Queens are running a clothing line. You know what a Queens doing?

67
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.120
Sitting around,

68
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.350
by the way, here's the other thing. You don't want to be a King.

69
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.390
You don't want to be a King. You're a guy. You don't don't call yourself a King.

70
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.300
Oh God. Like when a guy's in, we got it.

71
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.890
We've got a booth in Tao Kings. Only like, dude,

72
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.960
here's one thing that is for sure about a King.

73
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.240
If you're a King, you so bad.

74
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.430
Think about Kings. Think about how,

75
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.860
think about who actual Kings,

76
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.720
that rule lands you so

77
00:05:06.721 --> 00:05:11.130
bad. You're lazy. You're in your throne or you're in your bed.

78
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.140
You're eating grapes. You know,

79
00:05:13.141 --> 00:05:17.940
nowadays you're watching on Netflix or Hulu or Amazon prime.

80
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.470
And you're just sitting with your legs. When, when Kings lay down, dude,

81
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.180
their legs are so far apart because it's so disrespectful.

82
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.210
A King never lays down with his knees together.

83
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.840
He's always got his legs open and his balls out.

84
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.980
Like it's a to be eaten. That's a cane.

85
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.830
That's some kitchen and they're eating off of their belly. Dude.

86
00:05:40.831 --> 00:05:44.160
You think Kings? good. Nope.

87
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.840
And I guarantee if you're calling yourself a King in modern day society here in

88
00:05:48.841 --> 00:05:52.350
America or Ohio or Indiana or whatever the.

89
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.930
Cause you got a table at a club, you,

90
00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.320
you're basically saying you bad. You splurt in a matter of seconds.

91
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.310
And that's it. And your BRACA cat, cat ain't even that hard dude. I'm no King.

92
00:06:06.311 --> 00:06:11.200
You know why come on down a city where

93
00:06:11.201 --> 00:06:15.820
we got all day long and I'll have sex with you for 11 minutes,

94
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.880
swear to God no longer. Because then you're trying to prove something.

95
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.940
You're no King dude. You splurt in mere seconds.

96
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:25.870
So if you're a queen,

97
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.640
I mean just don't call yourself anything that has to do with the Royal.

98
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:31.803
You know,

99
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.280
there are some people out there that call themselves princess too.

100
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.860
And those people, I like to call Persians because that's who does that? Hey,

101
00:06:41.861 --> 00:06:45.220
I'm the pro Hey, what's up? I'm the Prince. Hey,

102
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.600
One time we laughed so hard in my, me and my friends were like,

103
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.850
we came out, we came out. We, I came up with the most Armenian,

104
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.850
the most Armenian thing you could possibly say,

105
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.430
This is the most Armenian thing you could possibly say. Okay?

106
00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:14.253
<v 1>Okay.</v>

107
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.900
<v 0>So if, if you, if you were in someone's house,</v>

108
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.460
okay. And ed,

109
00:07:26.461 --> 00:07:30.070
you touched their face by mistake, right?

110
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:35.170
Or even on purpose. This is the most Armenian thing you could say,

111
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:40.540
Hey dog. Okay. Hey dog. Don't touch my face.

112
00:07:40.541 --> 00:07:42.190
I don't like that. I don't,

113
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.260
I don't come to your house and like put my fingers in your face and stuff like

114
00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:51.094
that.

115
00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.150
Wow. That's the most Armenian

116
00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:04.510
you could possibly say is that someone touched your face in a

117
00:08:04.511 --> 00:08:05.290
house and you said,

118
00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.600
I don't come to your house and put my hands in your face and all that.

119
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.130
You don't see me coming to your house and putting my hands in your face and all

120
00:08:18.131 --> 00:08:23.080
that. Oh my God. You know why? Cause they always find some

121
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.520
to be disrespectful about that. So not disrespectful.

122
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.600
Hey bro. Did you ask, did you ask,

123
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:36.101
You know why?

124
00:08:36.101 --> 00:08:40.750
Because Armenians love to be disrespected.

125
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.300
Even though they pretend they're like, Hey, it's about respect,

126
00:08:43.301 --> 00:08:48.100
but they love to get disrespected. That's why they're always being like, Hey,

127
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:51.970
Hey, Hey, don't lower. The volume dog. We're all here.

128
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.820
Don't lower the volume on, on, on during the commercial. We're all here.

129
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.830
What if we wanted to buy what's on the TV, bro? That's not cool,

130
00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:06.300
bro. I mean how exhausting it is.

131
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:15.020
Oh, uh, with wearing the glasses with the that are,

132
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:17.750
that are so dark sunglasses that are so dark up top,

133
00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.640
but then fade lighter as they get lower

134
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:24.770
sitting like this dude

135
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.290
Sitting like this, bro. Oh man. So funny.

136
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.820
They dude. No, no Armenian.

137
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.420
There's no Mo if you are an Armenian and you like any movie more than star

138
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.700
Scarface, you're not Armenian straight up.

139
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.450
They want everything to be like scarf.

140
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.450
They want life to be like Scarface so much. It's unreal.

141
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.170
Like Persian, Armenian lives.

142
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:57.140
They want it to be like Scarface so bad and it's so not. And it's,

143
00:09:57.141 --> 00:10:01.010
and they try so hard. And so funny, dude, for sake, I have a friend,

144
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:08.630
one of my best friends, Persian. And he's just like, you know,

145
00:10:08.631 --> 00:10:12.620
bro, it is,

146
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:14.000
it is like that.

147
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:19.460
It is like Scarface first. Oh man.

148
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:22.190
Life is like a first you get the money. Then you get power. Dan,

149
00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:27.200
Dan only Dan comes respect and they work at a,

150
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:32.240
like a kiosk in the mall. You know? You're like really like, you're like Dan,

151
00:10:32.241 --> 00:10:36.590
you can get after you get respect, then, then you can get,

152
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.160
uh, the, uh, the family plan with the mobile.

153
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:44.720
You can get a family plan if you have that. Oh.

154
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:45.973
Dude.

155
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:52.430
Like say hello to my little friend Nima. He's the manager. He will help you.

156
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.770
Oh dude. Ah.

157
00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:03.770
I want to chill with all the Armenians and just chill one

158
00:11:03.771 --> 00:11:07.790

160
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:19.610
Karner for making fun of Armenians. Uh. I used to go to the coffee bean.

161
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.170
I talking about when I was talking to where I was, where I was,

162
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:26.690
where there was so many Persians and and I used to love, I want it to be,

163
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:30.260
I want it to hang with them so bad, but they didn't look like they would like,

164
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.430
man, I would do that, Joe. I would do. I did a joke.

165
00:11:34.431 --> 00:11:39.410
Something like what I was talking about now on stage sometime at the ha

166
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.760
cafe, there were a bunch of Armenians in the crowd and dude, it was so fun, man.

167
00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:47.570
We were laughing. I was making fun of him. I was saying that kind of.

168
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.960
And I was like, did you love the movie Scarface? And we were all laughing, dude.

169
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.660
that. awesome. See that's why it sucks.

170
00:11:55.661 --> 00:11:59.350
It's like you could take what I said and be like, Oh I was bashing.

171
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:02.890
But it's like, that is so wack.

172
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:08.530
It's when you're making fun of someone with someone like that.

173
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.880
love, dude. It's love, man. Like, look,

174
00:12:12.881 --> 00:12:14.260
we're all in this together.

175
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:21.040
It's awesome. If you make a joke,

176
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.940
then that's love, especially. That's what I do.

177
00:12:24.941 --> 00:12:29.560
That's what I love in my life is to make jokes. If I'm doing that,

178
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:33.660
I love it. Anyway, this

179
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.760
girl thinks he's a queen who may also be sitting there looking pretty posing

180
00:12:38.761 --> 00:12:39.780
with a cocktail in her hand,

181
00:12:39.781 --> 00:12:43.470
wearing a nice dress who probably thinks doing these things means doing well at

182
00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:46.560
life who will jump at the first opportunity to offer herself to any man who

183
00:12:46.561 --> 00:12:49.920
shows her the slightest bit of attention or uh,

184
00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:54.990
an or an ex note in exchange for an ego boost or for

185
00:12:54.991 --> 00:12:56.370
himself at her expense.

186
00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.030
As she clearly has no self worth respect or morals,

187
00:13:00.031 --> 00:13:04.770
values has accomplished nothing in life and only her has her looks to offer,

188
00:13:04.771 --> 00:13:06.480
which will fade very fast. I mean, Jesus Christ.

189
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.820
Then it really reveals your lack of vision,

190
00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:12.300
intellect and failure to distinguish gold from stone. Jesus Christ. I mean,

191
00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:13.050
this keeps going.

192
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:17.040
The sad truth is you are obviously also an unintelligent basic being

193
00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:21.270
just like the basic be who is the only type of human.

194
00:13:21.271 --> 00:13:26.010
You may be able to seek an invalid validation from your non-existent

195
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:27.180
confidence, self worth,

196
00:13:27.181 --> 00:13:31.830
describing the need to be associated with validated by basic B as an

197
00:13:31.831 --> 00:13:36.510
embarrassment is quite an understatement in my humble opinion. I mean,

198
00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:41.010
nothing is humble about this opinion. You called yourself, good-looking a queen.

199
00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:47.490
You said you sailed through three wall street firms

200
00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.240
and went to the top notch school. And,

201
00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:55.680
and you're like trashing guys and,

202
00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:59.550
and you and you, and then you end it with,

203
00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.140
in my humble opinion,

204
00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:05.820
what is this world?

205
00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:10.380
And the comments are slay icon or icons.

206
00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.030
Another one that people throw around.

207
00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.330
You're not an icon because you wrote a caption. You

208
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:25.050
can't dude. It's just also,

209
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.090
when you write a post like that,

210
00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:32.910
no bashing involved here, like you only,

211
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.680
the only thing that is apparent is that you're so insecure.

212
00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:42.690
Nobody like

213
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.860
how about when people are like, you know,

214
00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:55.220
I'm, I'm intelligent. You don't like, why are you Kanye West dude,

215
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:59.170
nobody let other people say those things. It's about you.

216
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.850
You say that the only thing I think is like, Oh wow, everyone always says this.

217
00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.313
Cause stro

218
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:17.050
so weird putting people back years too sad though. Honestly,

219
00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:20.710
really, really sad. Like,

220
00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:26.890
you know, I don't mean to be punching down, but kind of sad. Like,

221
00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:28.030
I mean,

222
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:30.760
I'm obviously not going to say her name so you don't trash because I don't want

223
00:15:30.761 --> 00:15:35.140
that. But my whole point is these captions.

224
00:15:35.141 --> 00:15:39.640
They got to go. You're the first to go. They got to go. These captions,

225
00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.200
just dinner at dinner you're here.

226
00:15:44.201 --> 00:15:48.070
Let me shorten your caption for you had some drinks.

227
00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:53.800
That's all that happened here. That's all that happened. Kay queen,

228
00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:58.960
all that happened is you had dinner.

229
00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.360
You're acting like you're on top of a mountain and it took you six weeks to get

230
00:16:04.361 --> 00:16:08.200
up there. Nothing happened. You know what happened?

231
00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.900
He put on an outfit,

232
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:16.240
these a long captions, they got to go, some comedians, do it,

233
00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.890
talk about your comedy. You know, when you're on,

234
00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:29.050
my comedy is shaped and evolved and this and that all really

235
00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:34.060
let other people say that about you. You and other people say it about you.

236
00:16:34.061 --> 00:16:37.330
I don't want to hear it. And if you're saying that about yourself, other people,

237
00:16:37.331 --> 00:16:40.630
don't say, what about you? By the way, straight up, stop,

238
00:16:40.631 --> 00:16:44.140
stop romanticizing your own life.

239
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:47.920
If you romanticize your own life,

240
00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:52.270
the only person you're bringing down is yeah. Oh,

241
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.650
this is a cult dude. These are the things we learn at the log cabin.

242
00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:03.850
And I've got a red laser pointer. And I point to all sorts of Instagram posts.

243
00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:06.850
I say, no, no, no. This is a no. And what did she do here?

244
00:17:06.851 --> 00:17:10.090
And what did this guy do here? Somebody raises her hand. Yes. Linda.

245
00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.910
He said he was a King. Correct. And what is he doing?

246
00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:17.920
He's just sitting in front of a bottle of crystal. Correct? And there you go,

247
00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:23.440
Linda, you deserve some who wants to be sucking and Linda and Linda goes, Ooh,

248
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:26.380
I would like him. And somebody goes, I'll do it. Oh great. This is it.

249
00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:30.580
The heater hedonistic lifestyle. Congratulations.

250
00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:35.320
Congratulations, Linda, you get your and Craig, will you please go eat her?

251
00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.430
I'll be happy to cool. There's some yoga mats out and the,

252
00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.140
in the tall grass go do it outside.

253
00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.740
Take it to the limit. And then, and then Armenians go like this. Oh,

254
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:51.550
did you know where that song's from? That's what I'm Scarface.

255
00:17:51.551 --> 00:17:52.480
It's so funny because.
