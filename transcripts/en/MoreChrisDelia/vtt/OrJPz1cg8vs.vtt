00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:05.220
I guess they'll assume the honors after that. And then what's on ladies.

39
00:03:05.221 --> 00:03:07.350
I'll use the on there and then they'll figure out the going,

40
00:03:07.351 --> 00:03:09.600
because they already heard it in the first one. Okay.

41
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.130
Male here seeing what's up on the Craigs. I was just thinking,

42
00:03:14.131 --> 00:03:19.080
think about how I hate when guys do this. When they take the, when they,

43
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.770
when they shorten the noun and they put the in front of it, dude,

44
00:03:22.771 --> 00:03:26.820
I was thinking about this yesterday. It's the most frat guy.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.860

they call him the Biebs or, or, or HIV.

47
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.200
They say the HIB, my mother, my mother.

48
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.810
That hurts my heart.

49
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.410

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.240

Not that I've ever done it because I'm Christian,

104
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.680
