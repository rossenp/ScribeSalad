WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.230
<v 0>Man do you, did you guys see the, um, the Le this is,</v>

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.970
so this is as ridiculous as, uh,

3
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.390
uh, this is like peak 20, 20. I kind of hate when people say that,

4
00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:18.300
but this is the truth. Newscaster.

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.340
Bring it when the newscaster said the LA knackers. Remember when she said that,

6
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.980
uh, did you guys see this? I mean, it went viral the other day

7
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.460
about the lady basically was, uh,

8
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.710
talking about Kobe Bryant or wait. No, we should talk about Courtney Bryan.

9
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.933
Yeah, she was,

10
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.300
and it was the LA Lakers and she was going to say Nicks and she said,

11
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:43.380
LA natures.

12
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.630
And it did not sound like knackers and also nacre is even sounds bad.

13
00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:51.450
So she said it and, um,

14
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.740
and it was so, and it was so like, what the?

15
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.390
Cause you said a quick and there were people that actually thought

16
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.520
that it was an outrage that she said the N word,

17
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.610
which is absolutely insane to me.

18
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.900
Like imagine being so racist, ending sane,

19
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.910
but also you were able to climb the ladder ad as a newscaster

20
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.380
to get to the point where you're like, no matter what,

21
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.460
here it goes, this is the moment I've been waiting for.

22
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.320
When one of the most beloved athletes of all time dies

23
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:33.960
prematurely, I've got,

24
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.880
I've gotten my chance on the worldwide stage to slip in the

25
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:40.620
N word and let everybody know.

26
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.900
Like there are people that actually think she said that, and she's racist,

27
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.270
which is so insane.

28
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.900
She obviously made a goof,

29
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.370
but people are going to want, people are trying to cancel this lady.

30
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.910
The fact that this lady even has to apologize for,

31
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.770
not for saying

32
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.520
Nate Kurz is ludicrous, but here it is. And it does sound bad.

33
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.590
<v 1>A star that was perfectly cast on the Los Angeles.</v>

34
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.843
But again,

35
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.250
the star that was perfectly cast on the Los Angeles

36
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.710
[inaudible] is perfectly cast on the Los Angeles.

37
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.550
<v 0>And said it did took a break and said the N word took a</v>

38
00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:45.410
break, took, took a breath and was just like, let her rip my babies.

39
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.000
I'm a racist and I can't help it anymore. You know what? it.

40
00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:53.090
Here we go. I know, I know it's taboo,

41
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.900
but gotta say it also the worst time, you know,

42
00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.590
it couldn't have been a worse time.

43
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.510
Literally literally could have been a worst time. One of the most famous,

44
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.961
I love it.

45
00:03:03.961 --> 00:03:08.250
Black people of all time died and she couldn't have set it at a worst time,

46
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.670
died fresh one hour before that.

47
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.090
And she had to slip in the N word hilarious. Anyway,

48
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.530
she obviously didn't do that. So lay off her case, it was a mistake.

49
00:03:19.531 --> 00:03:22.590
She meant to say Nicks. I think she said,

50
00:03:22.591 --> 00:03:26.280
which is crazy as it is because Nick's have nothing to do with it.

51
00:03:26.281 --> 00:03:28.050
But that's what our explained explanation was.

52
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.260
I guess she kind of does kind of owe an explanation because it really does sound

53
00:03:31.261 --> 00:03:35.190
like the N word still. Eh,

54
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.493
um,

55
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.180
it'd be great if she just said like a gay slur, like the,

56
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.540
the one that began with AF and he was like, I'm so sorry.

57
00:03:45.541 --> 00:03:50.370
I meant to say fire hydrant and maggots, like, wait,

58
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.540
what? Like really? I just hate gays,

59
00:03:54.541 --> 00:03:59.040
but um, that's I, I just had guys that couldn't help it couldn't help it.

60
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.340
Um, I,

61
00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:08.130
I just think it's how about Ari Shaffir dude,

62
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.200
this guy is a troll. It's the weirdest thing about RD,

63
00:04:13.201 --> 00:04:16.650
man, let me play this or you want to bring it up?

64
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.780
It's the weirdest thing about Ari is like,

65
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.710
I know Ari and he's always been the

66
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.030
nicest guy to me. Like just all I like,

67
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.770
I don't judge people. I try not to judge people unless like,

68
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.460
until I've met them and the guy's like legitimately one of the nicest guy,

69
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.970
like he's so nice every now and then he, Texas,

70
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.530
I haven't talked to him in maybe over a year,

71
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.130
but like every now and then he texts me. Yeah. And he's also done noble.

72
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.610
Like he, he texted me once that comics weren't getting paid enough.

73
00:04:47.611 --> 00:04:48.061
And he was like, Hey,

74
00:04:48.061 --> 00:04:50.610
I'm trying to sign this position petition for comics to get paid.

75
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:51.900
And I was like, Oh, that's really sweet.

76
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.600
And then he dosed Bert Kreischer with his family and,

77
00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.510
and did this. And it's just, it's just, I understand he's

78
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.070
but he wrote Kobe Bryant died 20 years too late today.

79
00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:07.990
He got away with rape because all Hollywood liberals who attack comedy and

80
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.330
rooting for Lakers, but play the, um, the video that, uh,

81
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.720
Rappaport tweeted it. If you look on his, um,

82
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.340
and it's also probably all over YouTube, but, um, but, uh,

83
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.730
yeah, like he just did this thing and here's the thing,

84
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.840
there's the weird thing about, um, let me,

85
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.500
let me actually play it. And then, uh, and then I'll, I'll get to it. I mean,

86
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.060
all day rapid, board's been, it'd be such a sports fan. I mean,

87
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.450
couldn't be posting more Coby. I love Michael Rappaport. He's such a nice dude.

88
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.330
Uh, but no, it's not on his own Instagram. He took it down. No. So I get,

89
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.910
right? Cause one fire is taking too long and I could have found it already,

90
00:05:47.911 --> 00:05:48.540
but I get.

91
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.630
So he linked it up to put it on his computer and play the audio on his computer.

92
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.230
But now I get off because the first thing you do when you type in a lyric comes

93
00:05:55.231 --> 00:05:56.580
up, Archie fare Colby video.

94
00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.110
And he just went too far and put Arusha fear and they clicked on all the only

95
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.710
arts fair.

96
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.160
And that's when I get off now it's fine because I'm trying to be an idea and I

97
00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:07.580
don't want to be petty, but here it is, play it right.

98
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.480
<v 2>In the world. And it's always a bunch of terrible stories.</v>

99
00:06:10.481 --> 00:06:13.480
And every once in a while, there's a good story. Good story comes out.

100
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.220
Guy who got away with rape got his today.

101
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.790
Kobe Bryant is a dog I'm here in Charlotte,

102
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.240
the whole moot team that originally drafted him. Uh,

103
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.910
maybe wouldn't have raped that chicken Denver, if he had been,

104
00:06:30.911 --> 00:06:33.100
if he had stayed in Charlotte with the Hornets. But anyway.

105
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.010
<v 0>Is that it? Um, it's so weird that he did that.</v>

106
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.400
I know he's a troll and here's the other thing too. People are like, you know,

107
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.550
it's calm. Some people who are defending him were like it's comedy, it's comedy,

108
00:06:45.551 --> 00:06:49.630
which yeah. And then people are like, well, where's the joke. Eh,

109
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.370
and I think, look,

110
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:59.470
Ari is playing a character that, and he obviously gets off on trolling people.

111
00:06:59.471 --> 00:07:02.710
Like it's what he wants and okay. Uh,

112
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.750
and it's insane to me.

113
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.490
Like it's utterly insane that he wants people to hate him.

114
00:07:09.491 --> 00:07:12.850
Like he's a heel. I get it. Okay. If this was a WWF,

115
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.490
he would be Hollywood Hogan or whatever,

116
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:20.620
bro. People are not going to know you're joking.

117
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.010
And also there's not really a joke in there.

118
00:07:24.011 --> 00:07:28.870
He's just kinda like trying to get people, egg people on.

119
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.520
And also here's the other thing, dude,

120
00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.250
you're going to get your kicked.

121
00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:41.560
Like you're a comedian. People always know where you are.

122
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.610
This when my jaw dropped, when he did this.

123
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.660
And I guess the whole idea is he wants people to talk about it and like that.

124
00:07:52.661 --> 00:07:57.190
But man. I mean,

125
00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.770
it's bad to do that.

126
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.590
It's just, I don't know,

127
00:08:08.591 --> 00:08:13.540
man. The other thing too is like, he's like Joe,

128
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.760
Joe, like a lot of people know who he is from Joe Rogan.

129
00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:17.650
And so people are tagging Joe Rogan, come get your boy.

130
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.270
Like you've got to think about like that dude. Like,

131
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.420
Oh God, I don't understand when people like want to be.

132
00:08:28.421 --> 00:08:32.500
So I don't under, I don't even know. I don't even get it.

133
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:37.480
Like I just don't get how isn't the idea as a comedian to put butts in seats.

134
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.910
Like people are just going to boycott you.

135
00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:44.530
I guess he's trying to find the real dregs of the earth that are just like,

136
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:49.270
yeah. That's a weird fan base though, man.

137
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.660
I mean people, even comedians are so mad.

138
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:57.900
Cause that's the thing it's kind of bad for comedy to do like that because

139
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.530
people are like, Oh, well he's going to hide. Here we go. Hide him behind.

140
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.950
Like it's a joke. And you're going to just say, it's a joke. Right.

141
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.920
And comedians just can say anything without repercussions. And it's like, yeah,

142
00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:12.900
well we're supposed to be able to,

143
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:18.120
but also make it Mo funnier than that. Dude,

144
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:23.150
make it a little bit, I don't know,

145
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.450
wink or something.

146
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:31.010
So you don't get killed. It's a,

147
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:33.860
it's a weird thing for me to see dude. Cause like I said,

148
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:38.420
art has always been super nice to me and to see him let's do that is just so

149
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:41.240
weird. What a lunatic,

150
00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.090
what a lunatic dude.

151
00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.650
I always think it's weird. You know, I don't know if Ari does this or not,

152
00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:52.581
but I'm talking about something else now.

153
00:09:52.581 --> 00:09:54.950
But like I always think it's weird that when like somebody dies or whatever the

154
00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.970
something happens, kid gets molested and it gets exposed like comedians,

155
00:09:58.971 --> 00:10:03.400
just race to Twitter and like are like, ah, let me come up with the best jokes.

156
00:10:03.401 --> 00:10:06.800
So it'll pop off and it's just like, dude, give it time man.

157
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.080
Or like what about the families? I guess, you know,

158
00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.300
I honestly felt weird posting. I haven't posted since Colby died.

159
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:19.070
Cause I felt weird because I don't really post about

160
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:22.520
serious. You know,

161
00:10:22.521 --> 00:10:25.610
I've kind of made it a point to not post about serious because I don't,

162
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.980
you know, it's comedy, I want to do comedy mostly the 95% of the time.

163
00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:35.570
Um, I'd probably do it more than 95% of the time,

164
00:10:35.571 --> 00:10:40.460
but so serious posts always kind of make me feel weird to

165
00:10:40.461 --> 00:10:42.710
do as a comedian. And I'm not saying I never do it or I should,

166
00:10:42.711 --> 00:10:47.420
or you should never do it if you are a comedian. But um.

167
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:50.630
I totally lost my train of thought, but yeah, I just,

168
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:56.600
I just feel like it's weird to even post about anything

169
00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:02.510
besides Coby right now because everybody knows about it and it would just

170
00:11:02.511 --> 00:11:06.890
be weird to be like, here's a funny video I made, uh,

171
00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:11.030
I guess out of respect, I don't know, morning. I don't know. Uh,

172
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.433
not sure, really.

173
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:20.750
I don't know what to say about that RA thing, man. That was crazy. Um,

174
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:27.500
and here's the other thing too. Like people are like, I want to them up.

175
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:31.460
I want to beat the out of him. That's not the answer either. I mean,

176
00:11:31.461 --> 00:11:35.180
I know there's a bit that, uh, I don't want to ruin the bit,

177
00:11:35.181 --> 00:11:39.020
but what's his name? Chris DiStefano mate was doing this funny bit about how,

178
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:44.150
uh, very generally like people, people, I love Chris DiStefano,

179
00:11:44.151 --> 00:11:47.660
man love this dude. And it was, he was talking about how,

180
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.730
uh, people need to get people on Twitter,

181
00:11:52.731 --> 00:11:57.130
say anything because they're behind a keyboard and they need to get punched in

182
00:11:57.131 --> 00:11:59.520
the mouth though. Like you need to get punched in the mouth South.

183
00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:02.941
They need to get punched by then.

184
00:12:02.941 --> 00:12:05.010
That's a reason why they're behind their keyboards because they need to get

185
00:12:05.011 --> 00:12:08.610
punched in the mouth. Whatever. It's hilarious. Obviously what I said,

186
00:12:08.611 --> 00:12:12.990
wasn't just funny because it's not my bit and I just was explaining it. But um,

187
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:15.510
and I don't want to say the funny part because it's his material.

188
00:12:15.511 --> 00:12:19.950
You should go see him. But um, he, uh, you know,

189
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:24.960
punched in the mouth is one thing, but like people are like tweeting addresses.

190
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:29.820
They're tweeting like that is crazy, bro. These people need to get,

191
00:12:29.821 --> 00:12:34.530
get checked, punched in the mouth is one thing, but dude, don't incite a mob.

192
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.110
That is insane to be like, all right, well this is your address.

193
00:12:37.111 --> 00:12:39.210
This is a person's address. This is everyone's address. Go ahead.

194
00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.960
Like that's I don't know. I don't think that's the answer, man.

195
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.680
I don't think that's the answer. I know some people have done some bad,

196
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.660
but you got to let the, whatever it is,

197
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.750
the authorities or the people that are the powers that be.
