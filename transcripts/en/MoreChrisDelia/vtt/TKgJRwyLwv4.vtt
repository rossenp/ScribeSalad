00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.790
<v 0>It's amazing. When you look at the internet,</v>

2
00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:05.250
how many people get off daily about things?

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.070
Did you ever thought about when Twitter started and stuff like how annoying it

4
00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:14.590
would be and,

5
00:00:14.591 --> 00:00:17.800
and just like the white male bashing.

6
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.040
<v 1>Which you know, is so weird.</v>

7
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.000
<v 0>Um, but like the,</v>

8
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.020
the Tarantino thing was the craziest to me,

9
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.140
like when they were like, what,

10
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.000
what I heard an article about it, or I read an article about it.

11
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:42.970
And it said once upon a time in Hollywood,

12
00:00:42.971 --> 00:00:46.860
this is on N this is on NBC news.com.

13
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.340
Think opinion, analysis, essays, hot,

14
00:00:51.341 --> 00:00:53.800
take hot take. You know,

15
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.640
don't say your own thing is a hot take, by the way.

16
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.860
That's for other people to say, I'll hot take, you know, hot, take my.

17
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.090
It says once upon a time in Hollywood, this is the title.

18
00:01:07.091 --> 00:01:11.590
Once upon a time in Hollywood takes the Sharon Tate murders and makes them about

19
00:01:11.591 --> 00:01:12.424
men

20
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.360
couldn't turn Tino's new movie reframes,

21
00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:21.390
a brutal crime is a story about white male heroism that does a disservice to

22
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:25.990
both Tate and to the story, dude. Kay.

23
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.870
And this is written was written by a guy or a girl. Oh, look,

24
00:01:28.871 --> 00:01:32.110
it's written by a girl. So, um, yeah.

25
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.850
<v 2>I didn't see the movie,</v>

26
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.880
but you literally it's the movies about what it's

27
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:39.714
about.

28
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.670
I don't even know how to explain this to a thick headed person.

29
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.210
The movie isn't about the Sharon Tate murders.

30
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.700
If it's not about the Sharon Tate murders.

31
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.923
<v 1>Okay.</v>

32
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.060
<v 2>It's about what it's about. So,</v>

33
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.670
I mean, how do I say this and not make you seem like a

34
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.660
idiot? A movie is about what it's about.

35
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.880
It's not about what it's not about you getting mad that once

36
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:13.230
upon a time in Hollywood

37
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.760
is not about the Sharon Tate murders is getting mad at

38
00:02:20.761 --> 00:02:25.230
the movie transformers that it's not about the

39
00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:26.880
Sharon Tate murders in the right way,

40
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.080
because the movie is just about what it's about.

41
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.080
So I don't, I can't explain how

42
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.010
you that's, it that's it, you go like that.

43
00:02:44.011 --> 00:02:46.500
Like we were in a court of law and they were like, well, we, you know,

44
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.120
we're really looking into this forensically about why this white male made a

45
00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:53.880
movie about the Sharon Tate murders. And it's not about the Sharon Tate murders.

46
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.330
Then I come in with my business too, because I'm a lawyer. And I say, well,

47
00:02:57.331 --> 00:03:01.560
you see movies are about what they're about. And then the LA the judge goes, oh,

48
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.170
okay. So during [inaudible] and everyone goes, yeah, that's true. Then

49
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.300
look at this, leave it to Cutera, you know,

50
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.020
to make a story about the murder of Sharon Tate, a truly.

51
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.240
<v 0>Horrific real crime, in which female cult this murder,</v>

52
00:03:17.241 --> 00:03:19.760
a famous pregnant woman that revolves around men.

53
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.190
<v 2>Also, what about Quentin Tarantino? Who made kill bill volume? One and two.</v>

54
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.710
That's about a check.

55
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.910
<v 0>I mean, dude, this is just outstanding. This article,</v>

56
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.220
this up dumb article.

57
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.470
<v 2>Here's the thing too. I tweeted about it. It's so crazy.</v>

58
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:49.060
How many people look I'm in Hollywood? I'm a Hollywood guy,

59
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.140
but it's so crazy when I tweet something like that.

60
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.540
<v 0>The traction it doesn't get.</v>

61
00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.460
<v 2>Because people are so, so scared to even like something.</v>

62
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.160
<v 0>Negative about something about this article. Cause then they'll be like, well,</v>

63
00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:06.160
I don't want to be racist or whatever the it is.

64
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.870
You're getting mad at the wrong, dude.

65
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.940
<v 2>Quintin Tarantino. Isn't a bad idea. He's a bad guy. He's not a bad guy.</v>

66
00:04:14.941 --> 00:04:16.890
I don't know this doesn't mean he's a bad guy.

67
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.330
I mean, look at.

68
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.290
<v 0>This for the most,</v>

69
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.210
for most of the film tape and Samantha family girls are sidelined seemingly so

70
00:04:30.211 --> 00:04:31.044
the real star.

71
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.120
<v 2>This is hilarious right here.</v>

72
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.120
This is an excerpt from the thing for most of the film tape.

73
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:39.800
And some man affiliate girls.

74
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.500
<v 0>Are sidelined seemingly. So the real stars.</v>

75
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.660
<v 2>Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt</v>

76
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.190
can do their thing.

77
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.290
Yeah. Yeah. How about this?

78
00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.690
<v 1>Yeah, they're.</v>

79
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.450
<v 2>The two biggest, oh you mean the two biggest, Hey,</v>

80
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:05.200
you don't have to put them in. You don't have to put real in quotes.

81
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.063
Do you know why?

82
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.840
Because they're the real stars of the movie because that's what the

83
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.460
movie is about.

84
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.530
That's what the movie's about.

85
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.810
Stop complaining.

86
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.960
This article is why Trump's going to get elected again.

87
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.370
I mean, it's so funny. And then in the middle of it says,

88
00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:36.570
want more articles like this,

89
00:05:36.571 --> 00:05:39.390
sign up for the think newsletter and get updates on the week's most important

90
00:05:39.391 --> 00:05:42.180
cultural analysis. Oh dude,

91
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.130
one more tastes like this, ate it.

92
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.940
Look at this. But Tarantino isn't interested in who.

93
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.010
<v 0>Tate was. Anyway. All he cares about is what she represents a sex symbol,</v>

94
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:04.610
a woman cut down in her prime. I didn't see the movie. So I can't speak on that.

95
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.613
Um,

96
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.420
it's so funny, man. The people like this is an article. Dude.

97
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.310
Imagine if I was this famous as famous as something that these people would just

98
00:06:28.311 --> 00:06:31.730
destroy me. How much should I say?

99
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:33.530
That's quote unquote problematic.

100
00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.010
Yes. So weird to me. Hot take. What does hot take mean? Bad take I for real.
