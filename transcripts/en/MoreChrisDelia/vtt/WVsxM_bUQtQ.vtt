00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.640
<v 0>Complaint you six fine dude. Some Mattachine kiss, fine, dude.</v>

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.580
TA take Kashi 69, right?

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.650
He is blaming everybody on he's blaming billboard

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.620
for, uh, to Kashi.

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.250
He's blaming a billboard for buying number ones,

6
00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:21.810
which of course you can do that.

7
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.060
He said six credit cards bought Ariana Grandy.

8
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.030
Um, he, the, uh, the number ones, uh,

9
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.190
that it's it's her billboard. It's her it's that, that,

10
00:00:37.191 --> 00:00:38.430
that's why they got the number one,

11
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.460
which of course that happened because why the

12
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.160
wouldn't people do that? People are like, it's not, by the way.

13
00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:48.600
It's not Ariana Grundy's fault.

14
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.750
It's a Billboard's fault. But that's how you do it.

15
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:55.584
Dude,

16
00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.610
on fire said before we turned this on the rich get richer and don't just say

17
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.400
blank, like that. But he did say that, uh,

18
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.600
I want to find this video and I can't find it. That's great on Takashi 69.

19
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.360
I should probably do this before I start recording,

20
00:01:11.361 --> 00:01:14.540
but I won't do it like that because I want to do it the way I want to do it.

21
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.410
And you guys are here for me for that.

22
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.450
This is Instagram six, nine I'm back. And they mad. He says

23
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.220
just made everything up himself. Here we go. He talks about the,

24
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.610
so listen, I want the world to know that. Okay. So first of all,

25
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.230
he's wearing grandma's panties on his head. So already

26
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.560
what you're saying is not going to be as interesting as what the is on your

27
00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:49.610
head. So that's a, uh, a huge criticism.

28
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.290
If you want people to think, you're interesting,

29
00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:52.790
what's coming out of your mouth is interesting.

30
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.850
Don't wear grandma panties on your head. Okay?

31
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.260
They're literally silk pink panties that are just like flopped on his head.

32
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.720
They're not even pushed back. They're just like, it looks like he's the,

33
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.670
the chef from the Muppets that you can't, we,

34
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.120
and he's dressed all in white.

35
00:02:11.121 --> 00:02:15.380
Like he showed up to paint with a grandma's panties on his chef,

36
00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:18.410
from the Muppet, lost his, lost his job. No, a chef.

37
00:02:18.411 --> 00:02:19.400
Whereas this is where he is.

38
00:02:19.401 --> 00:02:21.830
He's the chef from the Muppets he's wearing all white and a.

39
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.930
Nat that looks deflated.

40
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.880
It looks like he ran at ideas and he's got so many jewelries and

41
00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:33.830
four watches wearing a four watches because he's too too poor to get a watch

42
00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:36.440
that tells different time zones. He just has one for each time zone,

43
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.810
a guy Atlantic, I got Pacific,

44
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.620
I got central and I got the other one that nobody ever talks about.

45
00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:45.750
The one that Phoenix does that they go halfway to the year.

46
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.480
They go back and they halfway at a year to go the other way. Um,

47
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.800
I think I commented on this. I wrote four watches. Now you, there it is.

48
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.350
And somebody wrote, bro, who are you, Matt?

49
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.293
That's my favorite one.

50
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.970
<v 1>What is a lot? You can buy number one on billboard.</v>

51
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.380
I would do it in a more equitable.

52
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.380
<v 0>The room by the way, six, nine. Do it in a more echo-y room.</v>

53
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.550
Literally did it at, in a lobby somewhere.

54
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.820
Hey, what's up? You got Bob billboards.

55
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.040
<v 1>That's a register in your head.</v>

56
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.960
You can buy number ones on billboard. Now let me tell you what happened.

57
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.560
We had an ongoing investigation just now

58
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.700
[inaudible].

59
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.150
<v 0>Having an ongoing investigation.</v>

60
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.650
We was having an ongoing investigation, dude.

61
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.360
So it wouldn't get the part. If you auditioned for NYP de blue, sir,

62
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.060
we've we was having an ongoing indivi investigation.

63
00:03:51.061 --> 00:03:53.340
Why can't I ever say investigation? That's all good. This dude is,

64
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.940
just Rosie Perez with face tattoos. That's who he is.

65
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.080
Rosie Perez.

66
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.670
We was having an ongoing investigation. Dude.

67
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.630
That's actually the dumbest sentence of all time. You either were having an,

68
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.890
having an investigation or there's an investigation that's ongoing.

69
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.890
You can't have had an ongoing investigation.

70
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.990
We was having an investigation that was going on. That's still going on.

71
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.370
Just so it up.

72
00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.290
We was having an investigation that was ongoing to see if I could wear panties

73
00:04:28.291 --> 00:04:32.640
on my head. And it turns out that ongoing. I could have opinions on my head

74
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.300
and I'm wearing panties on my head. I got full wide.

75
00:04:36.301 --> 00:04:39.270
You want to know what time it is on the Atlantic? It's three o'clock.

76
00:04:39.271 --> 00:04:44.250
You wonder what time it is on the Pacific that's 12. Oh wait.

77
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.070
<v 1>Last Thursday.</v>

78
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.930
Ariana was stuck with you submitted 60,000 units.

79
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.820
Last second with the investigation, we found this stop saying invest.

80
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.260
<v 0>[Inaudible] dude, sit, trying to sound more legit.</v>

81
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.630
You know, with the investigation, we found this

82
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.260
people are just commenting on this. Oh wait. Where's the.

83
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.170
<v 1>They purchased half of those things was six credit</v>

84
00:05:19.171 --> 00:05:21.390
cards. When we asked,

85
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.510
where were those six credit cards linked to billboard said,

86
00:05:24.511 --> 00:05:27.510
we can't disclose that information. Understand this.

87
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.570
They bought 30,000.

88
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.050
And so units with six credit cards.

89
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.870
<v 0>I get it. He says that nine times during this thing, by the way,</v>

90
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.440
six credit cards, six credit cards.

91
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.220
I got grandma panties on my head. Six credit cards.

92
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.600
We have a, we was having an ongoing investigation,

93
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.900
six credit courts.

94
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.310
Where's the thing about when he put it on.

95
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.980
When he put the investigation,

96
00:05:57.981 --> 00:06:01.850
he talks about the Apple what's where's his stupid Instagram.

97
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:06.830
There's so many Instagrams for him to call she's six,

98
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.660
nine, God. You know what dude? I,

99
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.250
this is just, I don't understand. Oh, here he is.

100
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:20.390
He's sending it to me complaint. She's six fine. Um, yeah, he says,

101
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.690
that's like, when you say you were Apple, it's an Apple,

102
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.290
but also, you know, apples wed. Did you see that where it's like, Apple is red?

103
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.770
And of course it has the Apple green, but it's like saying the apples.

104
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.830
It's like, you see an Apple is red. And then somebody said, Apple blue,

105
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.890
six credit cards say idiot. Also.

106
00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:46.070
How was he still alive? Like, I don't want anybody to kill anybody,

107
00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:50.390
but how the is he still breathing? Dude, he snitches,

108
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.610
Oh, here it's Twitter. So I can fast forward it.

109
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.460
The Apple thing. He says, dude, here we go.

110
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.740
<v 1>So listen, I want the world to know that where's the Apple thing.</v>

111
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.070
If you want to explain to all the hardworking artists out there,

112
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.390
the hardworking artists that and established artists at that because there's a

113
00:07:10.391 --> 00:07:13.630
lot of established artists right now that don't get number ones in how you

114
00:07:13.631 --> 00:07:17.980
deduct. If there's 50 million streams right on Google,

115
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:22.990
why only count 30 million right? To late looking at an Apple, say,

116
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.430
I'm obviously looking at your, your red, but you're not,

117
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.010
but you're telling us it's not red. You got caught cheating red handed. Right?

118
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:38.260
<v 0>So confusing. So confusing. It's like an Apple. You look at it at red.</v>

119
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.650
You're looking at it and it's red. And if someone's saying it's not red,

120
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.720
it's like, you're cheating. You got caught red handed.

121
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.870
You're just saying red so many times just so confused.

122
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.170
It's like little red riding hood came up to you and said,

123
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.190
this Apple is like you say an Apple is red and little red riding hood is like

124
00:07:54.191 --> 00:07:57.760
that. Red Apple. Now red, you got called red handed,

125
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.131
wearing red wigs.

126
00:08:00.131 --> 00:08:04.960
It's like little red riding hood where red wings drive a Rav for robbery with

127
00:08:04.961 --> 00:08:07.810
red man in it and red Fox.

128
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.970
And he say the apples, red apples red, but then red Fox is like the apples,

129
00:08:12.971 --> 00:08:17.110
not red. And then you got caught red handed.

130
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.470
Cause you cheat and read. I read a book.

131
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:26.680
It's his favorite color

132
00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:34.030
dude? Yes. Um,

133
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:38.470
it's like red foxes and Yvette convertible with you and you there.

134
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:43.480
And you said the Apple red. Okay. And then a red man pop in and he say, Oh,

135
00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:46.570
the Apple not red anymore. And you got caught and you,

136
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.320
you know the Apple red and you read a book on it and you're like,

137
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:54.460
you read a book on cheating and you like, you got caught red handed.

138
00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:02.000
The worst analogy of all time. Congratulations, compliancy six fine

139
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:08.990
dude. The way he, the way it has, no payoff is amazing. Uh,

140
00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:13.430
Apple sometimes is most likely red. There's green apples. But just look at this,

141
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:18.410
first of all, just pick something that's always red. You know, Apple is red,

142
00:09:18.411 --> 00:09:18.591
you know,

143
00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:21.560
sometimes it's green show and sometimes there's in between an Apple could be

144
00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:23.990
very, you know, very light green or dark green.

145
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:28.280
But most of the time we think of the Apple is red. Just say a, you know,

146
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.350
what's red, Rudolph's nose.

147
00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:36.110
Just say what is always red? My, uh,

148
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:42.590
um, red swollen Dick was an episode of 10 minute podcasts.

149
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:49.670
Semi-mature never going to be running for president, but anyway, complaints,

150
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.820
you six fine, obviously, but he's probably dead by now.

151
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:56.390
I just started talking about it. But, and then Snoop dog made a warning to gosh,

152
00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.230
he's six nine, which is great. Snoop Dogg's 90.

153
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:06.600
<v 2>Last time you said something that I had, uh, uh.</v>

154
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:11.360
<v 0>Hey, Snoop dog, get better lighting for your YouTube video.</v>

155
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.820
You've got $7 trillion.

156
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:18.740
He literally looks like one of those people that would do a F a E.

157
00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.010
Why is he filmed by one of those people in almost got away with it?

158
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.900
Well, I just wanted the below that or whatever.

159
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.630
So for like muddy or it was illegal and was laundering.

160
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:33.650
<v 2>But the day I got time.</v>

161
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:36.290
<v 0>Snoop dog, your 90.</v>

162
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:42.140
<v 2>Last time you said some, I had time.</v>

163
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.370
Let the day I got time. Wow.

164
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:51.830
You better get the off my line, rat boy, rat boy,

165
00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:56.060
you really better leave me alone. I ain't doing one. Oh. No way.

166
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:58.063
No way

167
00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.870
gone and do your and get out of my way.

168
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:08.120
Get you the funky Dole head rainbow head dog, head.

169
00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:13.250
So you leave the dog alone.

170
00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:19.280
Readily the dog alone. Go find you a cat, a boy getting too far.

171
00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.060
<v 0>Away, too. Carried away with the analogy. You bet</v>

172
00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.510
better. Let the dog alone better go find a cat. You know,

173
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.000
they make me my leash. You know what I mean?

174
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.320
I'd be done eating a bunch of dog food, all full, you know what I mean?

175
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.220
Someone knock at the door and I'll stop barking. You know what I'm saying?

176
00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.010
on the side of a couch. You know what I'm saying?

177
00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:51.830
But to find yourself a cat, it got so far with it. I, you know,

178
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:56.410
I got a collar. Uh, did you lose your mind? I got full legs, man.

179
00:11:56.411 --> 00:12:00.190
I haven't got two arms. I got full legs. You better not come from me.

180
00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.200
<v 3>Okay.</v>

181
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:08.550
<v 0>Hey dude, you're 60. Get it together.</v>

182
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:13.440
You know? Uh, dude, I love it, man.

183
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:18.240
I love life. You know, you got this 22 year old. That's like, you know,

184
00:12:18.241 --> 00:12:22.260
you got one I put as red, you know, Apple where you looking at an Apple is very,

185
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:23.670
I mean, some apples is green,

186
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:27.420
but you're looking at this Apple red and somebody come up to you and they like,

187
00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.920
the Apple is not red. And then Snoop, Dogg's like, I'm a dog.

188
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:35.700
Don't come for the dog. Don't come for the dog. Y'all looking for a cat,

189
00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.610
go get a cat because I'm the dog. I got folded legs.

190
00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.390
I got instead of where my arms are. I got paws and legs.

191
00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:47.940
<v 2>With the dog. with the dog and then nice nothing. Nice.</v>

192
00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:52.770
Cool. Tourette's red boy rat boy again.

193
00:12:52.771 --> 00:12:55.350
He close closer with the rat boy. Okay.

194
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:58.590
<v 0>Oh. And then spans up for no reason.</v>

195
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.983
<v 3>God.</v>

196
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:08.430
<v 0>I would love if somebody, if like a troll like Takashi six, nine,</v>

197
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.630
or these guys were trolls. Um,

198
00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.010
well not even trolls guys who were famous for kind of doing

199
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.760
well, I guess he mean he makes music. I can't say does nothing,

200
00:13:20.761 --> 00:13:22.740
but like guys who are trolls,

201
00:13:22.741 --> 00:13:27.660
like guys who just want attention so bad will say like Takashi 69, uh,

202
00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:28.770
Donald Trump.

203
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.120
Me. No like, uh, like these guys that just

204
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.390
are crying for attention. You know,

205
00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.740
the chicks on insane or even worse.

206
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:47.940
The dudes on Instagram that are like, you know,

207
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:48.923
kicking back.

208
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:53.910
If just nobody ever paid a T like if some guy was a model, you know,

209
00:13:53.911 --> 00:13:58.620
the male model is a chair. He's a, just a chair. Right? Modeling is for checks.

210
00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:02.160
If you got a dude there you're a prop. You're the,

211
00:14:02.161 --> 00:14:05.940
you're the chair for the girl to sit on. It doesn't matter. Okay. Yeah. Your,

212
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:09.030
your bone structure is nice, but you're really just the chair.

213
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:14.250
That guy that if he like for a guy to win to,

214
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:18.930
for him to join Instagram and then have him just be like, look,

215
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.150
zero, people felt like a zero followers.

216
00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:26.430
Or if like Donald Trump tweeted some crazy, fantastic. And nobody said about it.

217
00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:29.700
Or Takashi 69 came out of jail. And nobody was like that rap.

218
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:35.010
I'm going to kill him. If nobody gave a, that would be so detrimental to that.

219
00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.550
But we can't, we can't not look at it.

220
00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:41.730
We have to look at it because that's the train wreck that's happening.

221
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.220
You rubber net. You're like, huh? You got to look at it.

222
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.680
It's like when the Apple is red, you know, it's just such a,

223
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:51.510
it's a bummer.
