00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.650
<v 0>Um, but my babies, that's where I'll be. Uh, and do you know why?</v>

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.630
Because life rips, dude. You know what?

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.370
It always surprises me.

4
00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:15.690
How much people like inspirational on Instagram or just period, really. I mean,

5
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:18.780
it's a whole reason why that place was, uh,

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.560
was able to be something in the mall.

7
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.760
Remember that place we'll call it whatever it was called,

8
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.950
like impressions or whatever the and you roll by it.

9
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.910
And it would have pictures of it would have the framed picture of a whale's

10
00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:34.170
tail. And, uh, it would be like perseverance or whatever.

11
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.170
What the was it called? Doesn't even, it doesn't matter at all,

12
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.460
but I will tell you this.

13
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.740
I got my shirt on with my sunglasses on and a shirt with my face,

14
00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:44.730
with my sunglasses on.

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.900
And the reason why is because dude I'm features too bright.

16
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.220
So where are your sunglasses today? Dude,

17
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.660
people cause people because let's be, you know,

18
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.220
let's because I'm inspirational, man. I'm inspirational, dude.

19
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.770
I can't help it. It feels good life.

20
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.160
I told you life reps and it does dude.

21
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.070
Uh, but it rips, but it's also, life is hot. So I'm going to turn the fan on.

22
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.680
Um, yeah, so that's, that's what that's what's up, dude. Anyway,

23
00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:25.040
I got my sunglasses on cause it's so bright dude. When I look ahead,

24
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.200
I can't, I can't help it. I'm in Albuquerque.

25
00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:34.070
I'm still back and forth and he's still back and forth in Albuquerque.

26
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.700
He can't help it because he's doing a movie.

27
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.680
He's doing a movie in a, and it's really fun and it's really hot. And the,

28
00:01:44.681 --> 00:01:47.780
and the fan doesn't work. So that's great duty. Yes.

29
00:01:47.781 --> 00:01:51.930
The fed doesn't work and it's plugged in. Oh,

30
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.470
because one fire kicked it out when he was setting up

31
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.010
the plug kicked out because when one fire was setting up it,

32
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.790
he hit it with his dumb shin. Yes, dude. Yes.

33
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:07.310
We're starting off hot and sweaty. Yes.

34
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.560
I gotta put this thing back in and then I got to start it.

35
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.660
Technical difficulties. Yes. Good thing.

36
00:02:17.661 --> 00:02:21.590
My sunglasses are on, dude. I don't want to get cataracts. You understand it?

37
00:02:21.591 --> 00:02:23.390
I went to the doctor the other day and I was like, doc,

38
00:02:23.391 --> 00:02:26.990
what's going on in my eyes? And he goes like this cataracts. And I'm like, why?

39
00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:29.690
And he goes, have you been out in the sun a lot? And I go, no.

40
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:32.803
He says, well, what the?

41
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.920
And I left and he goes like this, I'm at a loss. And I'm like, well,

42
00:02:39.921 --> 00:02:43.610
what the do I do, dude? Usually the doctor's like take two of these,

43
00:02:43.611 --> 00:02:47.720
come in the morning. But he didn't do that. So I got out,

44
00:02:47.721 --> 00:02:50.390
I slept out here and went back to another doctor, got a second opinion.

45
00:02:50.391 --> 00:02:53.240
He's like, I don't know what the to do, dude. I was like,

46
00:02:53.241 --> 00:02:55.970
you're not going to give me two of these to call you in the morning, next time.

47
00:02:55.971 --> 00:02:58.220
And he goes like this. I don't know what the deal dude.

48
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.000
And then they both called me a bout a week later and they go like this dude,

49
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.400
I didn't know who you were. I didn't know who you were when you came in. I mean,

50
00:03:10.401 --> 00:03:13.110
I knew you, maybe you dabbled in comedy or whatever the, but then they said,

51
00:03:13.111 --> 00:03:16.860
guess what? I know who you are now. And it's because you were on my TV and I go,

52
00:03:16.861 --> 00:03:18.630
what? And I go like, yeah,

53
00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:22.290
I saw caught in some stuff on Netflix occur in some stuff, you know, just on TV,

54
00:03:22.291 --> 00:03:26.340
on network TV. Am I? And I'm like, he does network too. And I go eat and I go,

55
00:03:26.341 --> 00:03:27.360
yeah. And he says,

56
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.520
I think that it might be the cataracts might be from your future.

57
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.230
Cause it's too bright. So now I wear these sunglasses and guess what?

58
00:03:37.231 --> 00:03:41.670
The cataracts went away and not many people will

59
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.350
honestly make up a whole story on their podcasts.

60
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.220
That isn't true.

61
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.110
And tell it to you because you can go to other podcasts for the news.

62
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.080
You can go to other podcasts for interviews,

63
00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.250
but there is one podcast that gives you a silly, goose time.

64
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.600
And that's it, dude. That is it, man.

65
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.290
If you're coming here for info, if you're coming here for interviews,

66
00:04:07.291 --> 00:04:12.060
if you're coming here for other, other than a silly goes time and that's it,

67
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.730
then dude, as they say, you're in the wrong neighborhood.

68
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.080
One time I was shot at dude and that's real.

69
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.370
I was walking to a girl's house. This was so long ago, man.

70
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.890
I was walking to a girl's house. And when I got there, she was like,

71
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.680
it's a bad neighborhood. And I was like, it's going to be fine, dude.

72
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.250
Cause chicks are always like, it's a bad neighborhood and it's not, you know,

73
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.593
because their checks.

74
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.370
But when you get a real beefy dude with shoulders that they film Lord of the

75
00:04:44.371 --> 00:04:45.204
rings on,

76
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.160
I parked two blocks away just to make a point.

77
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.830
I'm crossing over the street I'm taking, I, you know,

78
00:04:55.831 --> 00:04:58.320
I parked parallel and perpendicular to her house.

79
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.740
And as I crossed the street, I hear pap. And then,

80
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.880
and I go, what the? And then I go, all I was shot at,

81
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.460
uh, and then ran man,

82
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.500
like a to her house. Yeah. Did we hook up? Yes.

83
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.620
Was extra good because I got shot. Yes.

84
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.750
Still in the back of my head. Was I sad? Yes.

85
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.100
That is still sport. Yes. Did she move? Probably.

86
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.590
She doesn't live there anymore. Probably not,

87
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.270
but I think about it every now and then. Yes, that I block it out now.

88
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:47.813
Anyway, dude,

89
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.560
splurting and bad neighborhoods is way hotter because you never know what's

90
00:05:52.561 --> 00:05:56.970
going to happen to it. And we know that next. Why?

91
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.460
I even talk about that? Cause it's so obvious, dude. Um,

92
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.230
yeah dude. So you come here for a silly goose time.

93
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:09.290
And if anyone else tells you that you go to a nother podcast for a silly goose

94
00:06:09.291 --> 00:06:12.290
time, bro, get outta here other podcasts and.

95
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:14.960
They can have a silly goose time,

96
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.360
but you come here for the real silly ghost time dude. Anyway, man, I'm chilling,

97
00:06:20.361 --> 00:06:24.890
dude. I'm back in LA for two days to do this podcast

98
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.140
just so I can get it out there. And, and, and uh,

99
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.410
I did a show at the comedy store or at the laugh factory in comedy store.

100
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.380
And I talked about the cookie monster on stage for,

101
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.310
I don't even know why and it wasn't good. And it's.

102
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.110
<v 2>Okay, dude, because alive or reps,</v>

103
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.590
ah, for sake, [inaudible].

104
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.470
<v 0>Just drank some water dude. But yeah. Um, man,</v>

105
00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.010
if somebody didn't like me and they heard this and they thought we know what

106
00:07:00.011 --> 00:07:03.010
I'll give him, I'll give his podcast one shot and they turned on this episode.

107
00:07:03.011 --> 00:07:05.050
They would hate me extra. I'll tell you that much. That's for sure.
