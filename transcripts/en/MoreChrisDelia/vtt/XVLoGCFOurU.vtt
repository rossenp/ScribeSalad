00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.550
<v 0>Can't believe people listen to this podcast,</v>

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.240
but it's bigger than ever my babies, dude, we get so many views and listens.

3
00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:10.620
Now it's off the charts. You know what that means? PACS,

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.160
are you guys enjoying the show? You,

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.240
I did you that show I played a Creek called Henderson and uh,

6
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.560
let's talk about it a little bit. You know, when you're on a show, a real show,

7
00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:24.000
like I've done a lot of comedy shows,

8
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:27.240
but when you're in a real show with real acting and real actors and good actors

9
00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:31.170
and good production and good writers and and people that give a about it,

10
00:00:31.171 --> 00:00:35.490
you know, it's so funny to be a comedian on one of those shows, because

11
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.200
little people are, I'm really happy that people are liking what I did. You know,

12
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:43.380
a lot of people are saying a lot of really positive things about my performance.

13
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.340
And I really appreciate that. And I want you to know something. I know.

14
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.563
I know,

15
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.700
I know I'm going to go in there and do it at least. Okay.

16
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.720
Okay. Do you know what I know? Cause I got a good head on my shoulders.

17
00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.970
All right. I'm not going to go in and some up. Yeah.

18
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.050
I played in the scene where he had to torture me and stabbed my arms a little

19
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:07.890
bit. And I'm really getting into that, dude.

20
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.070
Do you understand? I don't act. I'm not dude.

21
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:18.030
I'm not going to act in it. I believe I'm a crazy.

22
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.590
You understand? I sit there and I think, okay dude, I'm getting tortured.

23
00:01:22.591 --> 00:01:23.424
Let's do this.

24
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.350
You understand? I'll cry right now, dude. I'm I don't these.

25
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.970
Where do I put? Okay. So if I walk in actors is what actors do. So if I walk in,

26
00:01:37.971 --> 00:01:40.250
all right, you want me to grab the thing? See,

27
00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:42.650
that's the thing I got to grab the phone and walk over here.

28
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.690
That's what happens when a director says, Hey,

29
00:01:44.691 --> 00:01:46.310
could you maybe say that over here?

30
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.660
That's what happens when an actor gets that note or you gotta go, Oh, uh, Oh,

31
00:01:50.661 --> 00:01:53.870
okay. I got it. Well, um, let me, uh, if I go over there though,

32
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.360
then I need to take the phone because the phone and you want me to already have

33
00:01:56.361 --> 00:02:00.200
the phone over here then? That's bro. No, no, no, no, no. When a director says,

34
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.720
Hey, could you say that over there? I go like this. Okay. And I do the.

35
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.510
And if it doesn't match in the, that's your problem, bro?

36
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.970
I don't ask these questions cause I'm really doing it, bro.

37
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.280
I'm going to ask it about props. Can you put the shirt on? Sure. Fine.

38
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.740
Did it make sense in the edit? I don't give a. I'm here to do.

39
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.233
<v 1>No.</v>

40
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.340
<v 0>Because this article go scroll up is Henderson from you based on a real person.</v>

41
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.840
Crystal, Leah plays an awful dude. you. I do. Cause they asked me, you know,

42
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.830
Oh, it's the, the, the two dumbest things that people are.

43
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.590
Oh, I get involved bro. When I do it, when I do it, I seen,

44
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.940
I get involved, man. You understand me, dude?

45
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.700
You'll you'll never see me act bad, dude. You won't see it. Okay.

46
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.590
Um, so, so,

47
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.580
uh, I was in, so the two things that people are saying,

48
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.230
what the is crystal, Leah doing in you bro act. And man,

49
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.550
that's how I do it. And here's the other one.

50
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.860
Hey, crystal, Leah keeps playing a pedophile twice

51
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.680
name another time, dude,

52
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.380
two times I played a pedophile once in you and the other one, I was on the show.

53
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:31.210
Whitney and that's, dude.

54
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.960
You can't name another one.

55
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.600
It's that's so annoying when people say that,

56
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.380
because did somebody wrote,

57
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.580
do you intentionally play pedophiles or do you do what? Hey, what?

58
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.030
They asked me to be in the thing. I like the part. So I said, yay.

59
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.500
I can't, all I'm trying to do is get to the point where I can be an action star.

60
00:04:01.501 --> 00:04:04.680
And then also in the end of my career, like the Liam Neeson years,

61
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.140
I can play a Japanese guy with no makeup.

62
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.330
That's my dream bro is to up the internet and just play a Japanese guy

63
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.440
with no makeup and have people just irate about it.

64
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.800
Well, why didn't they get a real Japanese guy to do that? Well,

65
00:04:25.801 --> 00:04:28.980
because Krista Lee is a big star, you know what? I'm 60.

66
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.940
And we thought he was going to get the box office.

67
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.750
And I did because I don't want to get nominated for a golden globe.

68
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.280
And that's it. No Oscar dude, just the golden globe and not win.

69
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.240
And all they do is straight my hair, no makeup.

70
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.820
And I barely use an accent because I'm so subtle dude.

71
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.740
And I'm not acting while I'm filming. I'm Japanese.

72
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.620
You are what you say are anyway. So what the it matter.
