00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.690
It was to run away and she's holding her granddaughter's hand.

Okay. Now we got a little girl. Wow. I love that.

That was like at a grocery store parking lot.

00:04:01.591 --> 00:04:02.424

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.680
<v 0>Oh. And she just threw the up. Like it was part of the play.</v>

53
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.620
Oh, she's killing it. Wow. That's not. How did that come?

54
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.920
Did they siphon that through her? How did she get that much in her? Wow.

00:04:22.921 --> 00:04:25.740
That's amazing. Uh, these guys already deserve it.

56
00:04:25.741 --> 00:04:29.130
I can tell this is the number three and these guys already deserve it.

57
00:04:29.131 --> 00:04:31.890
And I can tell because these guys all straight up, I swear to God,

58
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.630
our li our Theo Von fans. You can tell one, guy's wearing a Louisville shirt,

59
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.220
another guy's wearing a wife beater,

60
00:04:38.221 --> 00:04:41.520
and they're in a kitchen that you would be molested in a hundred percent.

61
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.140
And then another guy, I don't even know how to describe the other guy. He,

62
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.060
I mean, he just looked, he looks like he would be on every, any small,

63
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.230
any town where they were like,

64
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.660
and we're going live to the street to see what the deal is.

65
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.040
They'd be interviewing that guy. And there's a big, big, big,

66
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.400
big McDonald's cup on the thing don't ever get. The big, big, big meetup,

67
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.570
the McDonald's cup. That's too big. And then it, that,

68
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.190
that it has to get smaller. So it'll fit in cup holders. If you get that drink,

69
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.160
you're first to go get the out of life.

70
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.490
Get a drink that just fits in your cup holder.

71
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.540
Don't get one that has different sizes in it. What is it? A transformer.

72
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.920
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

73
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.150
<v 0>Wow. He threw up on Theo bond.</v>

74
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.520
You ever seen a Theo Von fan throw up on the Theo Von fan.

75
00:05:38.521 --> 00:05:43.200
Look at that one right there. Here's a baby. And the lady is holding it up. Oh,

76
00:05:43.201 --> 00:05:46.710
that's gonna throw up right on her face. And that's obvious. Good.

77
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.600
She deserves it. Oh, cute. Mommy. Ah, cute baby.

78
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.490
Aw, that's so cute, dude.

79
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.480
I want to have a son and have him throw up on me. Now, this guy is picking up a.

80
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.290
I mean, why are wheels so big? You know, [inaudible] this,

81
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:08.120
guy's got not only,

82
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.610
it's one thing to take the big tr truck wheel and toss it over as a workout

83
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:15.740
guy. You know what I mean?

84
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.680
And throw it over or take the mallet and smash it.

85
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.030
But this guy has got a whole apparatus

86
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.160
attached to the big wheel that you weight train with.

87
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.450
It says weight, training, cardio and fitness zone, full strong man facilities.

88
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.440
And this guy's got the apparatus in his hand and he's going to pick it up.

89
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.040
And my guess is he's going to upchuck all over the whole weight training

90
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:41.450
facility. Okay. Let's see.

91
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:47.800
<v 1>And he pulled it down and it goes up again and it goes up again and down again.</v>

92
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.090
Okay. Let a little bit of throw up out and then just kind of still okay.

93
00:06:52.091 --> 00:06:55.750
And threw up again. And he's still going. Okay. Hey bud.

94
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.380
Okay. Okay. Oh, cool. Came out his nose. Oh, he's okay.

95
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.260
Okay. Well, wow. This guy's a monster, huh?

96
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.380
Oh my God. This guy, April,

97
00:07:17.381 --> 00:07:22.300
once you start throwing up, stop. That's my whole motto.

98
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:24.430
Whatever I'm doing.

99
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:35.320
<v 0>I mean, the guy kept going, Hey guy, stop. Hey,</v>

100
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:41.410
all the doctors in the world stop that's them guy throws up nine

101
00:07:41.411 --> 00:07:45.850
times while lifting up a tractor trailer, all doctors in the world stop.

102
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.053
<v 1>Wow.</v>

103
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:54.933
God.

104
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:07.120
<v 0>That's amazing. I think they put a tarp down. Was that what that is?</v>

105
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.310
Yeah. They put a tarp down in front of them.

106
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:12.040
Like maybe like this guy was the throb guy. Hey,

107
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.170
we got Tommy come and he's a throb guy.

108
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:17.440
So put the tarp down.

109
00:08:17.441 --> 00:08:20.590
He's going to lift seven times this thing that nobody should lift seven times

110
00:08:20.591 --> 00:08:23.050
and he's absolutely gonna throw up. So, but the top down,

111
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:26.140
cause he always starts up. We've got Tommy going. So it's all good.
