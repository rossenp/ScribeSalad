00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.810
<v 0>This is the kind of arguments I get in my family. I get into my family.</v>

2
00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:06.900
These are the kinds of arguments I get into my family and with my family,

3
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.790
uh, on friends. Wait, hold on. I want to see this guy's name. What was his name?

4
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.690
Uh, Ross Geller. It says not. And that's not what I want. Eddie,

5
00:00:20.691 --> 00:00:22.820
I think is who's this guy.

6
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.600
Yeah. Who gives a? I don't care. All right. Look, uh,

7
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.190
my dad went to go put some calamari.

8
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.050
He had two pieces of kalimari on his fork. Now this is the important I,

9
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.250
I like talking about.

10
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.720
This has nothing to do with world events or current events,

11
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.050
but this is seriously. The kind of stuff that I think about.

12
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.790
And I want to know about my dad had two Kalamaras on his fork.

13
00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.500
Okay. One was on the fork,

14
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.050
obviously more than the other one. Cause one was on at first,

15
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.980
the other one was on it and I could tell it was on it precariously.

16
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.530
He didn't really poke it hard enough. Now,

17
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.790
when I saw him do that and not fix it, I was like, I noticed it now.

18
00:01:13.791 --> 00:01:18.530
I noticed it because I'm a Charlie. Goodnight.

19
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.840
what is it? Pie. Okay. I'm on the NBC lineup in 2003.

20
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.460
I'm a pie baby. So I saw it and I thought, well,

21
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.570
he's been dipping them in the sauce. It's on precariously. He's not going to,

22
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.640
he's going to lose it in the sauce. All right. Now I'm watching him do it.

23
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.510
Sure enough. He goes to dip it in, loses it in the sauce.

24
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.870
There's still some loses. One of them in the sauce.

25
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.880
There's still the other calamari.

26
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.050
Or if you're a piece of calamari in America, you say it like that.

27
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
If you're tiny, say Kalamata, you're not a piece of. If you're in here, he said,

28
00:01:54.261 --> 00:01:55.700
cut them out of your piece of. Okay.

29
00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.280
So there's some sauce on the one that's not in the sauce would that's

30
00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:05.750
doused obviously in the sauce. So there's one and he eats it and then I go, Oh,

31
00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:09.770
you didn't know that was going to happen. And he says, huh?

32
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.310
And I said, you didn't know you're going to lose that one in the sauce.

33
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.990
And he says, I don't care. And I said,

34
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.610
and then he goes and grabs it out of the sauce with the fork and puts in his

35
00:02:22.611 --> 00:02:26.600
mouth. I said, there's too much sauce on that one. Huh? And he says, nah,

36
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.570
now, um, you know, it's like, Whoa, first of all,

37
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.230
have a opinion about something that okay.

38
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.720
Have a opinion about something. All right.

39
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.430
If you're going to put a fork in a kalimari put it in the Kalamara.

40
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.170
If you want to get to Kalamara Kalamaras poke the whole two.

41
00:02:48.171 --> 00:02:51.740
Kalamaras all right. If you're going to dip it in the sauce, do that.

42
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.840
If you're gonna dip it in the sauce, for sure.

43
00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:55.610
Poke the two column Mari's all right.

44
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.880
This guy has one calamari in the,

45
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.730
and another one dangling off. Like it's a boogie. All right.

46
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.640
Dips it in leaves.

47
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:11.410
The one in the sauce eats the original one that was on low. And I say,

48
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:14.470
I didn't know, that was going to happen. And he looks at me and he says,

49
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.050
I don't care. And then he eats it. And I said,

50
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:20.230
there's too much sauce on that one too. Huh? He says, no, I liked it. Oh, Holy,

51
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:21.693
dude,

52
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.250
this kind of thing is not something that I live. Alright, dude.

53
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.190
I, I said to him, you didn't, again.

54
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:36.340
I said, you didn't know that you were going to lose that calamari in the sauce.

55
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.230
And he says, I don't care that it happened. And I said, dad,

56
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.060
that's not the question I'm asking you. Did, you know,

57
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.590
you were going to lose the calamari and the sauce. And he said, no,

58
00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:53.080
I don't think I did. And I said, well,

59
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.090
that's what makes you a bad detective and me a good detective man. And he says,

60
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.430
but I didn't think about it. And I didn't care. And I said.

61
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.570
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

62
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.640
<v 0>I actually don't remember what I said at that point.</v>

63
00:04:11.641 --> 00:04:16.200
But I do remember him then taking the calamari

64
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.140
in the thing and eating it. And I said,

65
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.370
that's too much sauce on that calamari. And you know it. And he says, no,

66
00:04:23.371 --> 00:04:24.204
I liked it.

67
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.460
And then the next thing he did was take kalimari out of the

68
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.210
Kalamara ball and put it in his mouth with no sauce, dude.

69
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.590
<v 1>Okay.</v>

70
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.300
<v 0>Like you dude,</v>

71
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.560
how much sauce do you want on each kalimari you don't do it.

72
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.790
How funny is it that he was just like carefree chilling. Oh,

73
00:04:47.791 --> 00:04:51.270
I want some sauce on this calamari. I want total sauce on this.

74
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.930
Kalimari and you know what? Ooh, let me go nuts and have no sauce on this

75
00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.250
dude. Oh my God, man. Find out the way, dude. He's 72.

76
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.090
How do you, like, how do you like to eat calamari?

77
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.560
How much sauce you like on the calendar?

78
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.420
This guy's just Willy nilly trying to scoop out Kalamaras like, it's that,

79
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.110
what's that thing that we try to grab a Pokemon or a

80
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.230
Teletubby out of a thing and you can never do it because you always grab it out

81
00:05:22.231 --> 00:05:25.110
of the, you put in a quarter and you grab it and you got it a little bit.

82
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.230
And you're like, Oh, cut it over to the drop it. And then it drops too soon.

83
00:05:28.231 --> 00:05:32.550
What do you call that thing and have a car at a carnival? What is it?

84
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.410
Grabbing game crane. Crane. That's what it is.

85
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.090
This guy's just doesn't know how he likes his calamari. He's 72 years old.

86
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.140
Didn't know how to like his calamari.

87
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.500
Do you best believe when I get a ice cream sundae? I tell him

88
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.870
if anything comes with sauce, dude, you put the sauce on the side.

89
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.100
I'll take the with the spoon and I'll decide how much sauce goes on each bite

90
00:05:56.101 --> 00:06:00.200
dude. And I'm not even 40.

91
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:04.940
And I know that I'm the young that's coming to you straight from the youngest

92
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:07.670
man alive. I'm the youngest man you've ever met. Dude.

93
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.920
I'm the youngest man you've ever heard of.

94
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.780
And I know this and my 72 year old father is just Willy nilly dropping calamari

95
00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:16.730
everywhere. And then sometimes just tossing them in his mouth.

96
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.710
That gets a chip with no sauce or a popcorn. I should say

97
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:29.380
all. We were laughing, dude. So I'm going to post a video in a little bit.

98
00:06:29.381 --> 00:06:32.140
My dad went in when he says, bye. He's so tired. First of all,

99
00:06:32.141 --> 00:06:35.830
he grabs the back of my head and he says, I'll see you later.

100
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.690
And gives me a kiss on the cheek, which is fine. That's cool.

101
00:06:40.691 --> 00:06:44.680
I like that, but it's always so high dude.

102
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.250
And every time he does it, I try to get on my tippy toes at the last minute.

103
00:06:48.251 --> 00:06:52.390
So he misses and hits my cheek and I'm like, dad, you kiss my eye dude.

104
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.610
And he's like, that's not your eye. This is your eyes. This is your own.

105
00:06:57.611 --> 00:07:00.910
He starts poking my eye and I'm like dad. And he was like, look, look, look,

106
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.430
let me just show you. This is your cheek. This is where I'm going to kiss you.

107
00:07:03.431 --> 00:07:07.270
And he kisses me on the right here, dude, right here.

108
00:07:07.271 --> 00:07:10.780
If you're watching the video. It's right here. Who kisses?

109
00:07:10.781 --> 00:07:14.350
Somebody on the cheekbone for real. I'm a go lower dude.

110
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:21.670
Go here. Kiss buck in a year. It's like the old, a one steak sauce.

111
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:23.470
Commercial gets you here. Get you right here.

112
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.630
Kiss where the guy's pointing on the commercial

113
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:34.510
dude. It's so no, no it grabs. It's so aggressive and high.

114
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.470
Nah, let me go. Come on, come on. And then I go to kiss.

115
00:07:38.471 --> 00:07:41.230
My mom and mom go right on my cheek word should be right.

116
00:07:41.231 --> 00:07:42.550
Like where the teeth meet, you know?

117
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.550
Um, I didn't wanna, I'm gonna post that video.

118
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.740
It's probably on my Instagram right now.

119
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.710
Um, so

120
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.540
you gotta know how to dip your calamine, by the way. I've never had California.

121
00:08:01.541 --> 00:08:05.920
My life never had calamine in my life and I won't have California in my life.

122
00:08:05.921 --> 00:08:07.720
I don't think that that's the kind of thing I want to do. Dude.

123
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:12.760
Never had California in my life.

124
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.910
I don't do things until I regret I haven't done them. That's how it goes.

125
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.010
It's why I never smoked weed. That's why I never drank alcohol.

126
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:20.470
That's why I didn't lose my Virginia till I was 19.

127
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.690
I didn't lose my Virginia till I was 19 dude. You know why?

128
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.570
Because I wanted to make sure I wanted to do it. And then when I regretted,

129
00:08:28.571 --> 00:08:29.770
I didn't have sex with that one girl.

130
00:08:29.771 --> 00:08:33.550
One time that was when I knew I was ready and wanted to have sex.

131
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:38.230
It's like when you're shopping, you go out, ah, don't want to buy that coat.

132
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.870
Let me leave the shop. You leave the shop, should've bought that coat.

133
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.590
That's when you go back and you buy the coat now me dauntless buy the coat.

134
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:45.790
Anyway, at this point in my life.
