1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.740
<v 0>Um, do this Buffalo wild wings thing</v>

2
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.320
is just insane, dude. The Buffalo wild wings thing,

3
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.030
pull it up is when they,

4
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.110
the Astros got caught cheating in like what 19 or no,

5
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.410
22,000 some year they won the world series.

6
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.590
And I guess that they just came out that they were cheating or something, right?

7
00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:28.140
Something like that. No, you don't know. Yeah.

8
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.630
Basically very basically if I'm wrong, who gives a? Basically it,

9
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:36.360
so, so the,

10
00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:40.980
the coach or the com or whatever the was like apologizing kind of, and be like,

11
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.900
cheers, never wins. So we didn't win. So don't worry about it.

12
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:45.330
Whatever we did was the S deck about it, you know?

13
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.110
And so also you better believe if I was playing baseball,

14
00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:55.500
I would be cheating so hard. Like there's no way I wouldn't be cheating.

15
00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:59.370
I would be betting against us and then not playing as well.

16
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.920
I would be like saying, nah, that's not what happened.

17
00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:04.680
I will be doing that kind of all day long. That's not what happened.

18
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.790
I'd be throwing people under the bus. That's not what he dude.

19
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.290
That's why I'm the catcher, because he did that. I should be right field.

20
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.560
And they'd be like, Oh, you know, this is what the Leah says.

21
00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:18.840
And some other guy would be like, no.

22
00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:23.490
And then I hope I would get the leg up in a cheating fashion. Understand.

23
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.860
Cause it's just baseball and I'd be raking in mils. But

24
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.403
uh,

25
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.060
so Rob Harris tweets breaking Manchester city band,

26
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.460
breaking Manchester city banned from champions league

27
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.120
for two seasons by F and find 30 million

28
00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:49.590
euros, U E F a F F a. And um,

29
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.270
so, so Buffalo, wild wings, right?

30
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.340
That's how you punish a team that cheats.

31
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.560
And I guess people thought, and I wouldn't even have known, but I guess Buffalo,

32
00:02:01.561 --> 00:02:03.840
wild wings change.

33
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:08.070
It was saying that was insinuating about how the Ash

34
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.733
Astros should be punished.

35
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.250
So Houston took to Twitter and started roasting them.

36
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.400
First of all, Houston, I love you. I legitimately,

37
00:02:20.401 --> 00:02:24.990
you're one of the cities I like going to and performing

38
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.160
in the most. I love Texas dude.

39
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.870
And you know, I wouldn't say this right now. If I wasn't serious. I love Dallas.

40
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.600
I love Austin. I love Houston.

41
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.020
San Antonio is that place.

42
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.240
And I love Texas because Houston

43
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.540
sure it's hot, but it's also banging everyone in.

44
00:02:48.541 --> 00:02:53.460
There is either a hot chick or a tall corn husk. And dude love it.

45
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:54.773
Dallas,

46
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.950
love how the girls go out with the hair that looks like battlefield earth just

47
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.090
sprayed up. Like it's 1987.

48
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.490
Love the dudes in Dallas that won't not

49
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.310
tuck in their shirts no matter what that

50
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.040
outfit love, Austin. Sure.

51
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:19.930
It me off that the slogan is keep Austin weird because you're not funky.

52
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.410
You're just a city with a bunch of weirdos in it that,

53
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.700
and every one out of every eight people has a mustache,

54
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.430
including the girls because they think it's interesting,

55
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.270
but they're still banging. Okay. And everyone's there for music,

56
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.990
but Austin Love ya. San Antonio,

57
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:39.880
you have the Riverwalk and everybody's drunk on it.

58
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.320
Love Texas. Okay. But Houston

59
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.890
and I hate saying this dude,

60
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.660
but we have a problem because dude,

61
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.850
the thing is you became a little bit of a

62
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.300
when Buffalo wild wings change,

63
00:04:03.301 --> 00:04:08.130
it happened to say this thing about Manchester and the air

64
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.260
FFA. All right, because you started saying, well, I'll never eat there again.

65
00:04:13.261 --> 00:04:16.110
Cutting up Houston, Buffalo, wild wings,

66
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.930
cards, by the way, what kind of a fat?

67
00:04:21.931 --> 00:04:23.940
So Aria that yeah.

68
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.860
Have a Buffalo wild wings membership card. Hey guy,

69
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.200
cut that up. Anyway.

70
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.970
Guarantee you were sweaty when doing it

71
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.890
also it's 2020.

72
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.880
Who's eating wings.

73
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.400
Who's still eat wings, dude. You know, the last time I put a wing in my mouth

74
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.400
at a party years ago because I was starving and that's all that there was.

75
00:04:59.401 --> 00:05:02.940
And I got there late dude. You should not be eating wings, man.

76
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.420
That's gross hookers or whatever.

77
00:05:06.421 --> 00:05:11.370
The Hooters that place legitimately thought it was named hookers for a

78
00:05:11.371 --> 00:05:15.900
second. Like, come on, man. What is this place?

79
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.210
Hooters dude. Hey dude, for real, just call it hookers.

80
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.930
Hooters. No,

81
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.770
don't call it hookers because I believe those girls should be making that money

82
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.791
and you should be tipping.

83
00:05:29.791 --> 00:05:33.030
Those girls and those girls are working hard and some of them got a family to

84
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.140
provide for. I like those girls. You're you're you're uh, you're uh,

85
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.530
you're trying to make that money and you're being positive in society,

86
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.440
but company just call your place. Tit,

87
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.500
you know, uh,

88
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.290
anyway, these people in Houston were like, look at this,

89
00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.540
look at this. Let's just pull up some of these,

90
00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:03.170
find some of them in woods and we'll just come on.

91
00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:08.090
Dude was my Twitter app where my Twitter at, uh,

92
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.660
go to some of them want to go to got this gift for Christmas. Look at this,

93
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.490
by the way, got this gift for Christmas.

94
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.890
They're cutting up the Buffalo wild wings card. Dude.

95
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:19.610
You got that gift for Christmas, from a who's someone that hate you.

96
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.220
Hey dude, that's Buffalo wild.

97
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:29.080
That's a Buffalo wild wings gift card, dude, dude,

98
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.310
sad. Hey guy. That's cool.

99
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.830
Also sad.

100
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.960
Um, look at this guy, Kenny Swift, this cook this cook name by the way.

101
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.170
And you're just lost business in the fourth largest city in the U S and

102
00:06:47.171 --> 00:06:48.070
surrounding areas.

103
00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.630
That's how you punish social media accounts that pop off with a DJ Khaled.

104
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.540
Jeff that says, congratulations, you played yourself, Kenny Swift,

105
00:06:55.541 --> 00:06:59.890
with the profile pic of that cat that that lady's yelling at or whatever the it

106
00:06:59.891 --> 00:07:03.280
is, dude, shut up, man. Shut up

107
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.240
by the way, the Houston Astros cheated.

108
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:12.370
So you're coming in to defense for people that robbed

109
00:07:12.371 --> 00:07:15.250
money in base in baseball,

110
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.640
you butt hurt. Kenny Swift couldn't sound more like a

111
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.760
country singer by the way,

112
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.400
God. That's so

113
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:36.040
ridiculous that they troll. you. it, dude.

114
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.600
I juiced in your being, uh, the people in Houston that are doing this.

115
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:45.310
You're being a. You're being a straight up. Dude, you're being a butt hurt,

116
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.580
dude, I would have, I don't eat wings.

117
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.450
I wanted to run to Buffalo,

118
00:07:52.451 --> 00:07:57.340
wild wings and get all the wings and put them in my pockets. And they'd be like,

119
00:07:57.341 --> 00:08:00.220
you want a bag? And I go, no, are you kidding me, dude?

120
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:05.200
I'm aware in these no bag, that.

121
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:08.560
They go in my pockets, wings.

122
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.790
And then this happened,

123
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.720
get ready to be. My baby's Buffalo,

124
00:08:19.721 --> 00:08:24.520
wild wings pulls the even more move and they tweet back

125
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.713
a day later.

126
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.390
So last night was the roast of Buffalo, wild wings,

127
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.250
courtesy of the city of Houston.

128
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:37.270
And honestly we deserved it well done.

129
00:08:37.271 --> 00:08:40.780
H town for coming to your team's defense.

130
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.420
And we're sorry about what we posted.

131
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.600
Hey Buffalo, wild wings.

132
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.360
You just solidified something.

133
00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:58.110
I'll never eat there because you went back on an

134
00:08:58.111 --> 00:09:02.700
opinion that first of all, doesn't matter.

135
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.060
And now it's news.

136
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.900
And now I know about it and I'm not eating there. And guess what?

137
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.490
Buffalo wild wings. And I'm serious about this next time. I see my friend,

138
00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:16.980
Jason, stay them. I'm telling them not to eat there too.

139
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.980
So that's two huge,

140
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:24.570
equally famous guys that are not going to go to Buffalo, wild wings anymore.

141
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.620
God. How imagine

142
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.680
being sorry about it.

143
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:39.360
About making fun by the way,

144
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:43.110
Buffalo wild wings. Why are you even tweeting about this?

145
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:47.520
The only thing you should be tweeting about is, Hey, we got wings.

146
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:53.130
That's every tweet that Buffalo wild wings should tweet should be them

147
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:58.110
saying, Hey, we got wings or reminder colon.

148
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:02.460
We got wings or Hey, do you like our wings?

149
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.970
Or Hey, you must like our wings.

150
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:11.520
Why are you tweeting about the Astros at all?

151
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.920
But if you do tweet about the Astros, do it once.

152
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.990
And if you take a stance and pop off in a humorous way,

153
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:26.130
and then you feel the heat welcome to my world, you.

154
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.230
But don't apologize for it. Especially when you know you're right. See,

155
00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:32.011
this is why I can't do.

156
00:10:32.011 --> 00:10:36.390
I can't trust you now because you did something that you thought you stood

157
00:10:36.391 --> 00:10:41.070
behind. And then cause the mob came running the fat sweaty palmed,

158
00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:46.410
Buffalo, wild wings, eaten gift card.

159
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.350
Having as gift certificate,

160
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:51.840
they kept coming.

161
00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:56.190
You guys felt the heat and apologize about some that you know is right.

162
00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:02.400
And you know that you still stand behind or you

163
00:11:02.401 --> 00:11:05.940
don't and you change your mind because these fat sows

164
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.750
find them. You know what? I don't trust you.

165
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:14.850
So how can I trust what you give to me to put inside

166
00:11:14.851 --> 00:11:19.500
my body wings? No,

167
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:24.090
don't eat wings by the way, dude, unless you want to get cancer.

168
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:29.310
There's some other than radioactive. Hey dude, they're orange.

169
00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.870
