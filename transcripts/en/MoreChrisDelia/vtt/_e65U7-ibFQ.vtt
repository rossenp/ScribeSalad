1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.390
<v 0>In fact, one thing that Trump said was just insane, dude.</v>

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.430
And now he's trying to act like it was sarcasm,

3
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.240
which is the best disinfect dent,

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.450
uh, Trump dude,

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.150
the guy's such a goofball and he says I was sarcastic. And he's just like,

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.890
and it's just a certain not sarcastic dude, dude, dude. Cool.

7
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.490
It's so cool to say, dude, did you know that instead of dude?

8
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.350
Um, now this is one of those YouTube videos. Let's check this out.

9
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:33.210
This is one of those YouTube videos that when I check it,

10
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.510
it won't it'll I'll have it and it won't have the actual YouTube video.

11
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.980
It'll have somebody talking about the UWC. There we go. It looks like,

12
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.090
and the government, who's this guy to protect us. What's this guy's name again?

13
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.220
Testing. He turned his attention with the magic pill. He turned the magic pill.

14
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.140
It couldn't look more like you sounds.

15
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.300
And that guy who the white house is scrambling to mitigate president Trump's

16
00:00:57.301 --> 00:01:01.050
suggestion that objecting or consuming something that should not be as consumed

17
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:03.390
or injected under any circumstances. Wow.

18
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.850
Chris Hayes points out as a part of pattern,

19
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.300
which was like a magic bullet to save him. And so Chris Hayes is the guy,

20
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.540
Chris Hayes looks like the guy

21
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.740
who brings, uh,

22
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.790
one piece of candy and eats it in front of the class. And everyone's like,

23
00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:25.710
is there any for anyone else? And he goes, and he's,

24
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.670
he secretly thinks that your mom, you know, your mom's don't love you. Um,

25
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.210
but when Trump says the thing about the I would make the economy and the stock

26
00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:34.440
market, all right, I don't want to risk.

27
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.110
I want to obviously see Trump saying this. I don't know.

28
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.520
<v 1>Whether it's an ultraviolet or supposing.</v>

29
00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:43.730
We hit the body with a tremendous, uh,

30
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.910
whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light.

31
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.560
And I think you said that has Imma check, but you're going to test it.

32
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.740
And then I said, supposing, you've brought the light inside the button,

33
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.030
which you can do either through the skin or in some other way.

34
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.960
And I think you said, you're going to test that too. So that was interesting.

35
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.480
And then I see the disinfectant knocks it out in a minute,

36
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.990
one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that?

37
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:13.663
She's not going to have

38
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.300
injections inside or most of cleaning cause you see it gets in the lungs and

39
00:02:20.301 --> 00:02:23.720
it does a tremendous number of along. So it'd be interesting to check that.

40
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.041
<v 0>Very interesting.</v>

41
00:02:25.041 --> 00:02:28.040
It would actually be very interesting to check that it would be so interesting

42
00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:30.680
to inject somebody with Lysol, but you know what?

43
00:02:30.681 --> 00:02:34.790
Let's not do it because can't do that because it's not medical supply and also

44
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.130
injecting it. It would be, it goes on the lungs was my favorite part.

45
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.450
It goes on the lungs. First of all, it would go in the lungs.

46
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.670
It goes on the lungs. This guys watched too many Avenger movies.

47
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.540
We just put an ultraviolet light and yeah, I, I know, I understand.

48
00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:54.920
I understand what he meant to it. Okay.

49
00:02:54.921 --> 00:02:57.470
I understand about the ultraviolet light and all the, but guess what?

50
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.500
I'm not a scientist also dead work. Okay. Can't wait for the comments.

51
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.180
Oh, did you just stop talking about politics?

52
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:05.650
You obviously don't know what you're talking about. No.

53
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.600
I don't know what I'm talking about. Okay. But the thing is,

54
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.280
I'm not president, I'm not a shocker potatoes dude.

55
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.840
Uh, yeah. And the lady with nine scars,

56
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.470
this lady is always looking like she just got twisted up in some curtains and it

57
00:03:22.471 --> 00:03:24.720
was like, but I'm late for the briefing and then ran.

58
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.830
And he's talking about how you can just inject

59
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.270
the and like, let me tell you something to do with my, uh, what do you call it?

60
00:03:36.271 --> 00:03:41.250
My, uh, radar for sarcasm. My radar is pretty good. You know, I'm a,

61
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.360
I'm a, I'm a comedian. I literally almost said I'm a computer.

62
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.540
And if I did that, I would've just left. I would've left.

63
00:03:48.541 --> 00:03:50.280
I would've drove out of my house and I would have,

64
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.650
you wouldn't have seen me for a long, long time. All right.

65
00:03:52.651 --> 00:03:54.990
Because I would've just given up on life. I would've cried.

66
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.160
I would've just listened to that.

67
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.390
[inaudible] funny face is Sharvin bass is learnin.

68
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.150
Vase is while I was driving and his kid is carrying a funny furniture for some

69
00:04:09.151 --> 00:04:12.120
reason. I think the word funny is in that song so many times. Um, but uh,

70
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.690
I would have been crying mad world,

71
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.360
mad whirl. Well, if I said computer instead of comedian, now,

72
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.450
now boys, I'm a computer. Cute. All.

73
00:04:23.451 --> 00:04:26.760
I'm a computer like that old judge out thing that went viral. But anyway,

74
00:04:26.761 --> 00:04:31.170
I'm a comedian. I am. I'm pretty good at understanding what, what a, uh,

75
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.330
sarcasm is. And also a president don't be sarcastic.

76
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.600
Number one, job. Be sarcastic fire man. Number two, president. Okay.

77
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.500
Hey, get out. The building's burning. Oh my God. Really psych does.

78
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.450
It's the same thing. If you're the president inject Lysol, you are kidding.

79
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.900
Well, 18 people died from doing it because you're the leader of the free world.

80
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.370
Anyway. Uh, shouldn't have done it. Why can't he just be like,

81
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.530
I don't know what I was talking about. I didn't mean to say it that way.

82
00:05:01.531 --> 00:05:04.680
I know how it came off. Oops. Okay. Why doesn't he just do that?

83
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.460
Why doesn't he just do that? Everyone would be like, Oh, all right, well, yeah,

84
00:05:08.461 --> 00:05:13.020
that was a goofy whatever, but he's like, well, I can't be wrong.

85
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.580
So I was, I was sarcastic, sarcastic dude.

86
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.550
Also I didn't do the motion. You know,

87
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.550
he should have done that if he was being sarcastic. Yeah, yeah.

88
00:05:23.551 --> 00:05:27.570
Inject Lysol in your veins or [inaudible]

89
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.080
anyway, uh,

90
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.730
Biden got endorsed by Hillary Clinton, which is just like,

91
00:05:35.731 --> 00:05:39.810
and he was just like I'm with her and he retweeted it. So Hey, uh, Biden,

92
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.910
you know, let's not,

93
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.630
let's not do that because that'll definitely make sure that you don't, um,

94
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.470
you don't, uh, you don't, when you understand what I'm saying,

95
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.900
Biden with that tongue swoop that

96
00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.560
at tongue swoop that Trump retweeted the Geoff, the deep,

97
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:01.820
it's not a deep fake, I don't think.

98
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:06.230
But the Biden after he was talking about beef jerky, you probably did that.

99
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.550
Or some binal bring up anything, dude. Biden will bring up anything

100
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.570
fine. What are you going to do with the economy? You ever,

101
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.430
you ever put together a chair? Um, yeah. So,

102
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.720
uh, so yeah, so he's just like I'm with her and everyone goes like, Oh,

103
00:06:25.721 --> 00:06:27.880
you like Hillary? Cool. Well then you don't believe in pizza gate.

104
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.950
You lost my vote. Um,

105
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.370
so yeah, so, so I don't know, but that thing was scary as.

106
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.790
And then people, and then I sent it to the group text and Nick Swardson said,

107
00:06:39.791 --> 00:06:44.170
is that real? And I go, okay. I can't, you know, no,

108
00:06:44.171 --> 00:06:47.290
it's not real. Cause he looks like a demon. Um,

109
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.220
but uh, yeah, so he was, uh,

110
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.800
he retweeted that and people were like up in arms,

111
00:06:53.801 --> 00:06:58.630
dude labels are absolutely up in arms about this sticky that Trump

112
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.250
used and weaponized a deep fake the,

113
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.490
for you that you wouldn't think that the first person who weaponized the deep

114
00:07:06.491 --> 00:07:10.030
fake is the president of

115
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.680
the United States of America. You'd imagine it would come from a

116
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:21.010
PO box that was out of, out of commission. But it comes from,

117
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.560
I saw something that said it you'd think it would come from this place,

118
00:07:23.561 --> 00:07:27.550
but it came from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Yeah, dude,

119
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:32.140
I understand people are real dumb. I understand people are so, so stupid.

120
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.930
Like you can't, you know,

121
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.360
That whole inciting a riot thing, but it's like,

122
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:44.080
if you're real stupid and you think that a, that, that Biden thing is real.

123
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:46.540
You're the first to go, bro.

124
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.560
You gotta get on the front line and just get a rat tat tat it up, dude,

125
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.590
fight for our country and get out, Pat it up. Um,
