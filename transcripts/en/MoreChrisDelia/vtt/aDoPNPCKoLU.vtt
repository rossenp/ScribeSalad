00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.130
<v 0>Um, when I was doing, I was thinking about this when I was a kid. Um,</v>

2
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.770
I, the earliest memory you have, do you remember the earliest memory you have?

3
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.200
It's like, it's like hard to remember beyond before, like three, you know,

4
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.880
I remember when my, my brother was delivered. Um,

5
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.770
they say that like a, baby's a pizza,

6
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.780
but I remember when my brother was born and he came home and

7
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.020
he was in the car and I asked my mom because I was sitting next to me and he was

8
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:34.080
in the car seat and I was like, why does he have wrinkly hands? And my mom said,

9
00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:37.110
what? And he uses his fingers all wrinkly. And my mom was like, Oh,

10
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:39.480
that happens to babies because they're, you know, that's just their,

11
00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:42.870
their skin isn't ready yet or some. I remember that. And then I also remember,

12
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.760
uh, that day when my brother got home, uh, my grandpa got me a He-Man toy.

13
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.910
And when they gave me the He-Man toy and they said, Oh, Chris, isn't that cool?

14
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:53.070
I said, yeah, but he just got me that because he's here.

15
00:00:53.071 --> 00:00:56.370
And I pointed to my brother, is this smart as a three and a half year old,

16
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.460
because they're trying to make me feel good and also worth something.

17
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.830
Even though my brother was in the world now, and he's still,

18
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.540
and he's still my thunder and it's all good.

19
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.120
But that day he stole my thunder because he was born. Okay.

20
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.490
But I also remember a time.

21
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.960
One of the other earliest memories I ever had was when I was in my bedroom as a

22
00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:16.770
young, young kid, young boy, um, there were,

23
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.850
I had crayons in this yellow box. I forget what the other box was called,

24
00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:22.770
but you would unlatch the box, open it up.

25
00:01:22.771 --> 00:01:24.240
And they were open and it took the crowns off.

26
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.320
And I started drawing on the wall and my parents came in later and they were

27
00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:28.950
like, Oh.

28
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.550
<v 1>Oh God, what the did you do? You drew all over the wall.</v>

29
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.800
<v 0>I remember having the feeling,</v>

30
00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:37.670
thinking what you can't draw.

31
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.510
You can't call her on the wall. I remember feeling like, Oh,

32
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.200
I didn't mean to do anything wrong, dude. How crazy is that?

33
00:01:45.201 --> 00:01:49.850
That I remember a time learning about how,

34
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.560
like, I didn't know, it was bad to color on the wall.

35
00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.020
And that was when I learned it was bad to deface stuff. That's,

36
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.540
I felt good that I remembered that. I remember thinking like, Oh my God,

37
00:02:05.541 --> 00:02:08.540
I didn't mean to do something bad. Why is this thing though?

38
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.170
Okay, well, this is breaking, but we'll fix it. One fire literally just goes,

39
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.950
Oh, um, but yeah, I remember that.

40
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.810
What's your earliest memory tweet me, but you know what? I don't give a,

41
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.220
but still you should think about it for yourself because you know, if it's,

42
00:02:28.221 --> 00:02:31.730
when you were like 12, you got huge problems or you're trying to hide something.

43
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.680
Um.

44
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.513
<v 1>Mm.</v>

45
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.530
<v 0>This is another thought I had that I never thought about,</v>

46
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.030
but like we have balls and a Dick, you know, guys,

47
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.070
and like, think about how uncomfortable that is for real,

48
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.700
like, you don't think about how uncomfortable is it because it just how you are.

49
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.870
But think about if you just balls and didn't exist.

50
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.030
And then all of a sudden we just got balls,

51
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.020
or we would never not think about it every second of the day, we'd be like, Oh.

52
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.130
They'd be like, yo, you want to go grab a soda out of the fridge? You'd be like,

53
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.270
ah, I got this balls and Dick, I don't know, man.

54
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.640
I just want to be careful, you know, can we Postmates? It you'd be like, yeah,

55
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:21.550
but not right to your chair and be like, all right, I'll go get a,

56
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.440
I'll tell you what, when I'm hungry, I'll get up.

57
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.060
Because then I got to get food and the drink,

58
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.330
that's crazy that we have balls and Dick that's insane that we just have this

59
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.670
target in the middle of our bodies that can be lightly brushed up against

60
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:40.420
and ruin our hour. That's insane. And we just have them.

61
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.800
Girls don't have them, bro. If a girl gets kicked in the, in the, you know,

62
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.070
in the, I don't like to say it like this, but if a girl gets kicked on the,

63
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.140
then she gets, she's like, Oh, but it hurts. Like she gets punched in the arm.

64
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.230
If you get kicked in the balls, it hurts.

65
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.050
Like you get kicked in your nucleus dude.

66
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.990
You didn't kick the nucleus.

67
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.710
That is probably would have hurt as much.

68
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.380
It probably hurts more than if someone were to reach inside and squeeze your

69
00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:11.920
brain. And we just have them on us. That's.

70
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.650
Jesus Christ should have made some protective gear. You know,

71
00:04:19.651 --> 00:04:24.030
we had to do it manually as humans. We had to make a jock strap, bro,

72
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.590
Jesus, get on it.

73
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.260
We got balls on the outside, come on, bro.

74
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.420
Make a football helmet, you know, give us football helmets over our balls.

75
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.170
And we could have different teams and was like, Oh, you got all,

76
00:04:40.171 --> 00:04:42.960
you got the Eagles. I would, I would get the Viking.

77
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.630
I would like to get the Vikings. I would like to have purple ones, a purple one.

78
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.463
<v 1>You know.</v>

79
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.833
<v 0>Anyway,</v>

80
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.610
that's all I'm saying is you don't realize how dainty balls are,

81
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.080
uh, until you think about what if we just got them.

82
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:00.653
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

83
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.830
<v 0>And that's probably the most important thing I possibly said on this whole</v>

84
00:05:04.831 --> 00:05:05.640
podcast today.

85
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.290
Or maybe even ever remember that episode one 26. I think

86
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.390
so. Yeah. Watch out for your balls dude. Girls don't get it too.
