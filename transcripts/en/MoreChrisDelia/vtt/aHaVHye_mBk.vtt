00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.910
<v 0>Uh, there's one more thing that I want to maybe talk about before I even go, uh,</v>

2
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.670
into this, uh, this is the best the, the, the, the, the,

3
00:00:10.671 --> 00:00:12.630
the spring, the spring breakers,

4
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.800
Florida spring breakers, Dr. Dena Grayson tweeted. If I get, well,

5
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:22.530
she was just tweeting about this, basically letting people know,

6
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.130
and every tweeted it, but these kids on spring break,

7
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.460
this was like days after they told people that it was a bad, bad thing.

8
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.080
These idiots, dude.

9
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.010
<v 1>I get Corona. I get Corona at the end of the day.</v>

10
00:00:34.011 --> 00:00:36.320
I'm not going to let it stop me from partying. You know, I've been waiting,

11
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.500
we've been waiting for Miami spring break for awhile, but.

12
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.970
<v 0>Okay, fine. But also this isn't about you.</v>

13
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.510
And I don't expect you to know that, but I'm just telling you,

14
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.000
you're going to spread it and people are going to die.

15
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.440
I'm not done with that sentence. You idiot. Okay. Now I am.

16
00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.170
I'm also the guy who's saying it is. So the guy who would be saying it,

17
00:01:00.171 --> 00:01:01.880
I can't believe it. It's so crazy.

18
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.750
<v 1>Multicloud trip, two, three months. Where's that you're having a good time.</v>

19
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.160
Whatever happens happens.

20
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.410
<v 0>Happens. People die, people die. Look at this girl, this idiot.</v>

21
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.690
<v 1>Spring break, spring break, but how privileged,</v>

22
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.760
what is there to do here other than go to the bars or the beach?

23
00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:24.650
And they're closing all of it. It's really maximum.

24
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.510
I think they're blowing it way out of proportion.

25
00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:29.660
I think it's doing way too much is bad. We need a refund.

26
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.090
There's Laura St that serious. It's serious.

27
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.890
It's more serious things out there like hunger.

28
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.260
<v 0>Some more serious things out there. That's the best.</v>

29
00:01:36.261 --> 00:01:38.630
One time I was on the road with my friend, Jason Collins,

30
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.710
and we asked a security guard where there's a Starbucks because of the Starbucks

31
00:01:42.711 --> 00:01:44.810
we were close to is closed. And I said, and we said, Hey,

32
00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:46.130
do you know where there's Starbucks? And he said,

33
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.270
it's another Starbucks down the block. And we never stopped saying it.

34
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.690
It's another Starbucks, Starbucks, Starbucks.

35
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.880
It's another Starbucks, a few blocks down. It's another Starbucks dude.

36
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.680
What's wrong with theirs. Even the subtitles on this, fixed it. They wrote,

37
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.510
there's more serious things out there. And he wrote,

38
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.040
it's more serious things out there.

39
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.320
<v 1>Ain't that serious. It's serious.</v>

40
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.660
It's more serious things out there like hunger and poverty.

41
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.650
We need to address that.

42
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.170
<v 0>ESR the cronies dude.</v>

43
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.530
<v 1>A long time ago. And it was kind of up in the air for you. So go by, like,</v>

44
00:02:24.531 --> 00:02:27.740
we're here. I just turned 21 this year. So I'm here to parties.

45
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.890
<v 0>She sound like that.</v>

46
00:02:29.891 --> 00:02:34.730
That's the most annoying voice in the world.

47
00:02:34.731 --> 00:02:38.480
Dude. Imagine dating that girl. I don't know.

48
00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:41.870
I just feel like if we watch the last, if we watch it,

49
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.770
you know, now if we start watching it now,

50
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.250
I'd rather just wait until it's all done. And then we can stream it.

51
00:02:49.251 --> 00:02:51.560
Every episode each after another, this way,

52
00:02:51.561 --> 00:02:55.700
you don't have to wait every Sunday to watch. And that's some she'd say,

53
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.000
why can't we just wait until game of Thrones is over completely.

54
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.040
Then we can just stream.

55
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.890
<v 2>It all together. This way we can watch it whenever we want to.</v>

56
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:04.330
And we don't have to wait every Sunday.

57
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.070
<v 0>How did she make every word sound? The same? It's she's the,</v>

58
00:03:08.071 --> 00:03:10.670
basically the she's making every word rhyme. She's like,

59
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.280
she's like the female Eminem. This girl, this girl, miss her calling, dude.

60
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.600
She's she should rhyme orange with door hinge. Poverty. We need this girl.

61
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.560
<v 2>Yeah. I mean, we planned this a long time ago and it was kind of up in the air.</v>

62
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.140
Yeah. I mean, my plan as a long time I got, and I was kinda

63
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.980
[inaudible] every syllables. The same. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye.

64
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.200
Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye.

65
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.410
<v 0>Aye. Aye.</v>

66
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.290
<v 2>Aye. She does King's speech.</v>

67
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.820
This is King speeches daughter, dude. This is King speeches.

68
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.920
<v 0>Daughter. God,</v>

69
00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.310
I'm the biggest idiot on the earth.

70
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.110
I can't believe you listened to this podcast. It's so stupid.

71
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.310
And we keep going.

72
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.470
<v 2>Dude. And we won't stop.</v>

73
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.530
<v 0>I got a little tussle, a hair that went in front of my face when I said that.</v>

74
00:04:13.531 --> 00:04:16.650
And that's so sexy, man.

75
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.610
Imagine me on top of you and we're doing it and you could be male or female.

76
00:04:20.611 --> 00:04:24.780
This isn't about gay or straight. I don't give a fantasize about me right now.

77
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.480
Me on top of you and it's sweaty and it feels real good.

78
00:04:27.481 --> 00:04:31.200
And I'm doing slow swoop down, dude. I don't do bang at a bang at a bank.

79
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.250
I don't like that. In fact, I never. I only made love even with hookers.

80
00:04:35.251 --> 00:04:39.360
Never had one, but I'm just saying if I were going to, I would make love.

81
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.060
I don't care if I have to pay you afterwards.

82
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.350
I don't it's you know what it is, dude? It's so,

83
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.940
it really is. Okay. So imagine me on top of my shoulders,

84
00:04:53.941 --> 00:04:56.490
did they shoot Brokeback mountain on the back of them?

85
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.870
Maybe it was a long time ago and my shoulders weren't as beefy.

86
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.380
But you guarantee if they made a sequel, they would be back there right now.

87
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.480
And imagine me on top of you and sweat stripping, and it's all good.

88
00:05:09.481 --> 00:05:11.670
And whether you're a male or female, let's say you're a male. I don't give a.

89
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.490
We're still, you know, I never understood really how gay guys could do it.

90
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.630
Not doggy-style.

91
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.430
Cause it's kind of weird to me if the guy's on his back and the other guys on

92
00:05:20.431 --> 00:05:23.010
top of him and then that guy's kind of Dick is just like flopping around or

93
00:05:23.011 --> 00:05:25.410
whatever. I don't know. Does he jerk off or do you do it?

94
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.430
Hey dude, I don't know. But if you want real, listen to NPR,

95
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.090
but if you want the really real, stay tuned to my babies.

96
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.010
Cause this is the that MPR should be talking about when gay guys not

97
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.780
is the guy on the bottoms, Dick flopping around. That's all I want to know.

98
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.700
Okay. But my point is I lost my train of thought. I lost my train of thought.

99
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.170
I lost my train of thought. Oh yeah, I got it.

100
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.550
I'm sexy because if I'm on top of you and if you're a dude,

101
00:05:56.551 --> 00:05:57.800
let's say your name Hank or whatever.

102
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.250
And I'm on top of you and your flopping around and I'm doing the slow controlled

103
00:06:01.251 --> 00:06:06.200
swoop down mode movements. Right? I don't want to say I'm known for, but I,

104
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.790
I know I do them. And then all of a sudden,

105
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:15.290
my wisp of hair goes in front of my eyes. That's it, dude. Splurting everywhere.

106
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.250
Everybody's sweating everywhere.

107
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.520
Even people that aren't involved in the sex come in and like, Whoa.

108
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:22.100
And they start splitting and slipping and falling and hurting their tailbones.

109
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.890
Cause that's what happens. Dope dude, girls and guys,

110
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.030
and then Jeremy Renner comes in and goes, Oh my God.

111
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.223
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

112
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.280
<v 0>Sensational. Sensational. I'm a DJ dude.</v>

113
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.110
These DJs are doing live streams on Instagram because of the pandemic dude.

114
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.020
Not fun. The whole dude.

115
00:06:53.021 --> 00:06:57.070
It's not fun that there, if it's at least,

116
00:06:57.071 --> 00:06:59.860
if you're one of those guys that likes to unset out,

117
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.840
at least do it there and take Molly and be like, Oh, I love him. The beat.

118
00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:07.840
I could feel the beat. I could feel the beat. Dude. Imagine being at home,

119
00:07:07.841 --> 00:07:11.800
watching mighty mouse or whatever the his name is on the.

120
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.510

<v 1>So by like we're here, I just turned 21 this year. So I'm here to party.</v>

124
00:07:28.211 --> 00:07:31.600
So it's kinda disappointing, but we're just making the most of it.

125
00:07:31.601 --> 00:07:34.990
We met these other people in our little Airbnb spot.

126
00:07:34.991 --> 00:07:36.700
So we're just hanging out with them.

127

but we're just making the most of it.

133
00:08:01.151 --> 00:08:04.540
We met these other people in our little Airbnb spot.

134
00:08:04.541 --> 00:08:08.710
So we're just hanging out with them and trying to get drunk before everything

135
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:09.903
