00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.200
So, but so you do so you have your, you, but you also,

3
00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:13.320
this is something that cause like, I feel like you're like,

4
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.510
you feel bad about, um,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.840
like you feel deeply bad. So this is something I admire about you. Sorry,

6
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.311
what? Sorry. Oh,

7
00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:30.300
about the zipper you feel deeply bad about her hurting people's feelings.

8
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.580
Like deeply. I feel like you're like hyper feel badly about them. Yeah.

9
00:00:35.581 --> 00:00:38.910
That's true. Yeah. I'm very, yeah. I'm very empathic. Whether I like it or not.

10
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.110
Am I like that? Absolutely not. Yeah, no, I got all that. I got all that.

11
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.900
So I didn't start at the OCD. Yeah. You know what, actually,

12
00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:47.430
this is interesting. I actually wanted, this is,

13
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.250
this is the one thing I wanted to talk about. Really? Yeah.

14
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.760
Cause it's Christmas. Yeah. It's a scary world out there.

15
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.530
We're all going to see our families.

16
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.590
That can be very dreadful and it can be scary. And you know,

17
00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:04.770
if you're like me very empathic, you're even feeling bad.

18
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.500
Even if you feel good and then somebody comes up and they're in a bad mood,

19
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:08.334
you're like, Oh.

20
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.123
<v 1>Now.</v>

21
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.140
<v 0>Yeah. And then you feel bad because someone else felt bad.</v>

22
00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:18.140
That's not a good way to live your life. Right.

23
00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:22.820
So I have a lot of experience with feeling really bad. Right. Okay.

24
00:01:22.821 --> 00:01:25.280
So, so I have a lot of experience feeling really bad.

25
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.410
I figured out how to never feel bad. Oh, do you know? Nope.

26
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.030
But I think you're wrong already. Now.

27
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.200
I think you might even agree to be honest. Okay. This is like some real.

28
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.240
This is real. This is it's real. Okay. So,

29
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.660
uh,

30
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.790
one thing you can tell about something that's going to be real is if somebody

31
00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:48.560
says this is real. No, I, I S I S I preface it like that because I know. Okay.

32
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.260
When the right one, I say it, people are going to think I'm not serious. Okay.

33
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.450
Like, imagine the, I mean, that's my whole life,

34
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.410
the first guy that was like rubbed two woods together and it's fire. Well,

35
00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:03.520
you could just demonstrate that you say that. And the guy's like, no, you can't.

36
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.810
And the guy does it. Well, I mean, they're not talking because you're like,

37
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.290
[inaudible] okay. So, but it's like the first guy that was like, um,

38
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.870
when you come in a girl that makes a baby, well, no,

39
00:02:14.871 --> 00:02:18.320
you can just demonstrate that to someone. I was like, this guy died, you know,

40
00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:21.350
the G like the Christianity, you'd be like, you're crazy guy. Right. So,

41
00:02:21.351 --> 00:02:24.560
but then some people now look around the world, Hey man, look around the world.

42
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.830
Right. A lot of churches. Right. Somebody believed it. Right.

43
00:02:27.831 --> 00:02:30.620
And so it must've worked for somebody. Right. Okay. I'm not religious.

44
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.860
It's not why I bring that should start a church. I do. Well. Yeah. And it,

45
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.480
this could be its foundational tenant. Okay. This is real. Okay.

46
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.320
This is for anytime. You're going to feel, you might feel bad.

47
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.380
Someone makes you feel bad all throughout every day. It's bad.

48
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.100
You look at the news, bad. You think about your feelings batshit.

49
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.260
You think about what people think of you. Bad. Only bad.

50
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.640
Always only all the time. Bad. Right. Sometimes it's like, okay. Right.

51
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.680
Rarely is it great? I can make it if you're coming. Right. You know,

52
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:00.490
that's rare though.

53
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.410
It's like seven seconds of coming versus 23 hours and

54
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:09.400
59 minutes of non 47 seconds. That's a good amount.

55
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.870
And I wasn't even right. Actually, we got it right now. Okay. And anyway, so,

56
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:17.750
okay. It's actually you, so in any situation like this, it's,

57
00:03:17.751 --> 00:03:22.330
it's sort of like all purpose, right? You let's do it as an example first,

58
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.820
but I'm wondering if it's taking you to guide them along to say,

59
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.740
that's part of how do you make, how you make sure people know you're see.

60
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.170
That's true. That's true. That's true. I guess that's a good point.

61
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.590
You ever listened to anybody? NPR serious talk. Yeah.

62
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.590
This is how it goes to the NPR. It was the 33 minutes before they make a point.

63
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:43.150
So true. Right. Is it true that monkeys? You know what I mean? And you're like,

64
00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:44.620
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

65
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:47.080
You can take a break in the middle and just pick back up at the end,

66
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.360
but you can't do that now. Cause all that matters. Okay.

67
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.560
So say something that I won't like. Okay. But hold on, you have to say,

68
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.930
I have to actually have to know I'm not going to like it.

69
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.750
So hold on before you do it because you know me very well.

70
00:03:58.751 --> 00:04:00.130
You can say something about me that, you know,

71
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:01.630
I won't like it has to be something, you know,

72
00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:04.360
I won't like in real life or just make, got to say something.

73
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.930
It doesn't have to be about. Yeah, I got you.

74
00:04:05.931 --> 00:04:10.000
I don't mind me if something I don't like whatever. So hold on. I'm going to,

75
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.020
I'm going to, you're going to say it.

76
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.290
I'm going to say the way you respond and then no matter what it is,

77
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.380
you don't feel bad anymore. You're going to say, okay. That's it. Okay. Okay.

78
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.320
Yeah. Doesn't it suck that everyone, you know, is going to be dead.

79
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.260
It can't be questioned. Oh, okay. Hey, everyone, you know,

80
00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:25.170
is going to be dead one day. Okay.

81
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.510
So yeah. Okay. That was a terrible thing to say. Yeah.

82
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.900
Every, every person I've ever known yeah.

83
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.540
Is gonna die. Yeah.

84
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.860
K or you just say K K Y K. Like, okay.

85
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.560
Yeah. But no, it's not. I mean, yeah,

86
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.100
but that's the word you're you're you're you're not just saying. Okay.

87
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.390
I'm like poaching from that area of words. Okay. Okay. Yeah.

88
00:04:54.391 --> 00:04:56.520
But here's the thing you could say it in a different way to right.

89
00:04:56.521 --> 00:05:01.050
Say something like, all right. Okay. So I got one. So, uh, yeah, the, um,

90
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.440
it sucks. Uh, my, my house was in the Malibu fires and a burndown.

91
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.430
Yeah. That's uh, I mean, I would, I love that. Oh, okay.

92
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.480
I love that too. For two. Now here's the thing that, for real though,

93
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:16.950
you could do it about anything, your,

94
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.660
your Christmas and then your mom is like needling you.

95
00:05:21.661 --> 00:05:24.320
How come you don't. Yeah. You don't have a girl. And I think that it's getting,

96
00:05:24.321 --> 00:05:25.081
you're getting, it's getting,

97
00:05:25.081 --> 00:05:27.660
you're getting too old and you're not going to be able to be a good dad.

98
00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:30.990
You're going to be too old to be a debt. Okay. Fair enough. Right.

99
00:05:30.991 --> 00:05:34.350
Like you could say it, right. You could say other words with Kay. Okay.

100
00:05:34.351 --> 00:05:37.020
But then the mom might be like, what do you mean? No, you don't.

101
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.670
It's not for her. Say the moms. So you feel better when you do those. Yeah.

102
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.830
I guess about other people. I get it. Who can do that's the whole point.

103
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.130
K not. Okay. Right. Okay. So that's the thing, right?

104
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.140
I used to brewed all day, dude. Yeah. This is serious. Talk to anybody. I know.

105
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.130
one fire knows anybody in my life that knows me. Well,

106
00:05:58.131 --> 00:06:02.240
enough is in my life for the last eight months. Knows what happened. Yeah.

107
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.170
And that's what happened. Okay. Yeah. I elaborately liked that. Yeah.

108
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.480
It'll work. Honestly. Everyone's going to be like either.

109
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.140
Ha what did he talk about? Just honestly, please try it. Please try it.

110
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.790
You're never going to be with your family. Anyway.

111
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.000
You're going to go watch a tweets now about it.

112
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.200
I'd probably do some videos and I will, I will say it's probably has something.

113
00:06:20.201 --> 00:06:23.380
It's probably like the Darren Brown thing. No. Yeah. Well it could be,

114
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.030
you're interrupting something.

115
00:06:25.031 --> 00:06:27.550
That's very like a handshake and you just go and they're like, what?

116
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.650
And they fall asleep to your own brain though.

117
00:06:29.651 --> 00:06:31.840
You can surprise yourself if you do it enough,

118
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.350
you bury it in the cerebellum part of the brain. I'm a scientist.

119
00:06:35.351 --> 00:06:38.410
I'm a scientist. I know. Okay. So you bury it in the cerebellum,

120
00:06:38.411 --> 00:06:42.550
so it's just automatic. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Right, right, right, right,

121
00:06:42.551 --> 00:06:45.910
right, right. So it's sort of like it's freeing it's.

122
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.410
It is Def it definitely is free. It's going to put meditation out of business.

123
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.200
Okay. Yeah. Wow. Because you don't need it anymore. I agree.

124
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.610
Does the same thing do the same thing. It might not do it as well,

125
00:06:57.611 --> 00:07:02.560
but maybe if you get, maybe if you get a sort of like on a roll with it,

126
00:07:02.561 --> 00:07:05.950
it could, it could be the kind of a thing, like the church of K, right? Yeah,

127
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.770
exactly. I just think people need to do it and learn.

128
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.680
It's not like you can really explain it. I showed you all,

129
00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:14.380
but it's not the same until you really do.

130
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.880
I think that we should do that. I'm going to start doing that. Yeah. I know.

131
00:07:18.881 --> 00:07:22.480
You've been saying KLM and text chains and stuff like that. It's yeah.

132
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.870
I'm really I'm evangelizing that's Angeles. Cool. That's very cool.

133
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:31.260
That's it's very cocky to do it that way, by the way. But sometimes got,

134
00:07:31.261 --> 00:07:34.960
somebody was like, Oh, my mom just died. Okay. Yeah. That's so rude,

135
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.420
but it's free, but it is free. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

136
00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:40.570
But also if you're going to get into like, somebody's with you. Yeah.

137
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:45.370
But you want to book. Yeah. Yeah. Hey.

138
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.480
Yeah. Not going to happen. Right. Right. Okay. That is true.

139
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.630
You know what Darren Brown was saying at one time he was going to get in a fight

140
00:07:52.631 --> 00:07:56.680
and the guy said, I, um, he's the guy was like, do you want to fight?

141
00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.150
And he said something like, uh, yeah. I think the wall around my house is,

142
00:08:00.151 --> 00:08:03.430
is about four feet tall, but it might be, it might not be, I saw him say that.

143
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.540
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm very similar to Denver. Yeah. Well, yeah.

144
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.880
Yeah. Okay. Sure. Okay. Yeah. How do you feel?

145
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.840
Uh, Oh yeah. I feel good because you know, maybe I didn't agree with you even.

146
00:08:16.841 --> 00:08:20.470
I just said K, it was freeing. It was a freeing thing for you, man. I wow.

147
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.470
It doesn't matter if I even hear it. Wow dude. And, but,

148
00:08:23.471 --> 00:08:27.250
so then how do you feel about how we look nice

149
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:28.683
segue,

150
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:33.430
but because I'm looking at the monitor and I think I look like pretty like good

151
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.230
in this. And I think that you maybe look like, uh,

152
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:42.330
like the hair like me, but I did heroin for a long time. Yeah. I think, I,

153
00:08:42.331 --> 00:08:44.860
I think I agree with that. When you look healthy, it looks like you do heroin,

154
00:08:44.861 --> 00:08:49.210
but also eat fruit. K. There you go. Yeah. Wow. Feel good? Yeah.

155
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.210
So would make me mad if somebody kept doing it,

156
00:08:52.211 --> 00:08:56.530
maybe you have to do it sparingly or no. Or it's just for you. You do it quiet.

157
00:08:56.531 --> 00:08:59.410
It makes me less, a little less mad. If the microphone wasn't here,

158
00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:02.290
you wouldn't even, I know it'd be for you. So you could do it under your breath.
