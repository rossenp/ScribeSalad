1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.960
<v 0>You don't want to start this show actually by doing this, this is so funny, man.</v>

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.500
Okay. There's there's a weird, I I've,

3
00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:12.300
I've got to the point where no matter what I say about anything on Twitter,

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.250
somebody is offended. It doesn't matter. It really sincerely doesn't matter. Uh,

5
00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:18.900
we live in a really sensitive time.

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.900
A lot of people are pretending that their feelings are hurt and a lot of

7
00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:26.610
people's feelings are actually hurt. However, um, I just,

8
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.000
I don't think about. My Twitter isn't really for comedy.

9
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:34.320
It's just for me doing dumb. Like I don't give a about it. You know? So,

10
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.230
uh, I tweeted,

11
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.010
I was in the Albuquerque airport and the, uh, the,

12
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.180
my flight was delayed for about two hours and it said, and, and it was just,

13
00:00:45.181 --> 00:00:49.890
I was looking around at just how weird Albuquerque was Albuquerque is so

14
00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:50.611
Albuquerque,

15
00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:55.590
like there's so many like the artwork is just so I don't even know what to call

16
00:00:55.591 --> 00:01:00.480
it. It's like every other painting is of a stick figure like this,

17
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.240
you know? And like Tetris, like pyramids.

18
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.160
I don't know where they got that or what the it is. And you know, I,

19
00:01:10.161 --> 00:01:14.490
I figured it's very Mexico inspired, but, um,

20
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.870
I just tweeted bro, Albuquerque, you know, I've been to some shitholes,

21
00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:21.600
but Holy God, you make Jacksonville look like paradise,

22
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.980
whatever Jacksonville Albuquerque,

23
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.620
you got some great people. Actually,

24
00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:33.150
I had a great time in Albuquerque doing my show, but once I left the show,

25
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.950
where am I? People live there for some reason.

26
00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:39.750
And it's all good. Now here's the thing, dude,

27
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.170
if I'm in LA fine,

28
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.850
somebody says they hate Los Angeles. I go like this. Oh cool.

29
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.530
If I'm from New Jersey, I'm from Montclair, New Jersey. If somebody says, Hey,

30
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.370
um, I'm from Montclair, New Jersey sucks. I go like this,

31
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.800
that's it. I don't get my feelings hurt because I am not my place.

32
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.970
And if someone says, Hey, you suck. Sometimes I get my feelings hurt.

33
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.920
But most of the time I go like this, huh? Grow your skin.

34
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.710
All right. So I tweeted this and I even think about it.

35
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.050
Cause I was just in the air airport and I was just like, Jesus Christ,

36
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:20.790
this place. You know, imagine living here,

37
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.260

38
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.640

39
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:31.710

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.680
Claus ad get out of here. This is what it said on the, I made a set.

42
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.890

99
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.280
It's so beautiful. It's like heaven. You go to Santa Fe. I swear to God.

100
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.220
And I went to, I went to, uh, you go to Albuquerque.

101
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.800
And when I was talking to people to Albuquerque, they're like, will you go next?

I was like Santa Fe. And they were like, Oh good luck. You know what dude,

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.630
do you know who you are? Santa Fe's beautiful, man. If I die,

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.140
if I died and woke up in Santa Fe and Jesus Christ was like,

you've got to live here for the rest of your life.

106
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:54.020
I'm like this smooth sailing dude. There's hot Springs. There's 10,000 ways.

107
00:06:54.021 --> 00:06:57.350
There's a place called 10,000 waves where you can just go and chill and hear

108
00:06:57.351 --> 00:06:58.184
water falling.

109
00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.200
<v 1>Good afternoon. Albuquerque has been a punching bag for a few celebrities.</v>

110
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.840
They've made their way through town. The latest a well-known comedian.

111
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.730
<v 0>I was on stage when I was on stage talking about Albuquerque. I said,</v>

112
00:07:09.731 --> 00:07:11.650
you know what? Albuquerque is like, it's like a place. Oh no.

113
00:07:11.651 --> 00:07:13.630
I said this in Santa Fe the day after I said, you know what?

114
00:07:13.631 --> 00:07:14.920
Albuquerque is like, it's like a plate.

115
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.490
It's like if the whole world blew up and then they were like, okay,

116
00:07:18.491 --> 00:07:20.020
well I guess we've got to start from scratch.

117
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:24.220
And then nine years later that this is what they had. They're like, wait,

118
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.740
we it's kind of impressive. We did this at nine years,

119
00:07:26.741 --> 00:07:29.050
but also it's not as good as it was.

120
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.830
That's why Albuquerque is like a post-apocalyptic nine year,

121
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:36.070
nine years after the post apocalypse, nine years after the apocalypse.

122
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.530
That's what Albuquerque is like. And they're like, yeah,

123
00:07:38.531 --> 00:07:39.760
we only got the buildings this high,

124
00:07:39.761 --> 00:07:42.340
but we have a theater that we call the chemo by mistake.

125
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.210
And it was right next to cancer Mart

126
00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.070
here. We have the tumor Valley, uh, what do you call it?

127
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:06.310
The tumor Valley. My, I swear to God, dude.

128
00:08:06.311 --> 00:08:10.780
I can't remember words and. What is the house that moves mobile home?

129
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:16.750
Um, dude, I'm so, so this is what, so then I said on, on Twitter,

130
00:08:16.751 --> 00:08:18.760
I was making fun of Albuquerque because if you live in Albuquerque,

131
00:08:18.761 --> 00:08:23.320
you got to know where the you live. Don't pretend the isn't Narnia.

132
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.210
The building's about this high. You got to crouch down to get into any place.

133
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:34.390
<v 1>Ash, the city after playing Getty city owned treasure, the chemo.</v>

134
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:35.763
These are teams, Rebecca.

135
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.730
[inaudible] what he said and how people are responding. Rebecca.

136
00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:45.040
<v 0>Always with the way too long as news newscasters do it.</v>

137
00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.850
When they jump on the last sentence. If you're in the field,

138
00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:53.860
jump on that last sentence, jump on it. We're going live.

139
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.840
This is me. This is me. If I'm a newscaster, we're going live to Krista,

140
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:02.970
Leah in the field. And to see what some of the locals have to say about,

141
00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:06.810
Hey guys, how's it going? I'm cutting them off. I'm feeling it out, dude,

142
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:11.220
rather than that's way better than we're going live to the field. Crystal, Leah,

143
00:09:11.221 --> 00:09:14.100
to see how locals feel about what he said on Twitter.

144
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:24.300
Hi, how's it going? I just want to do this too long, man.

145
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.560
I could eat lunch in the middle of that. Pause. That pause is so long.

146
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.150
A baby came out of it.

147
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.033
So.

148
00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.830
<v 1>So still Leah performed at less Thursday. But while he was here,</v>

149
00:09:39.831 --> 00:09:42.320
he had some sort of a bad experience.

150
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.800
<v 0>No, your, Oh your bad news.</v>

151
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:50.570
I didn't say I had a bad experience. I just said Albuquerque

152
00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.153
[inaudible].

153
00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.450
<v 1>After Chris D'Elia is a big name in the comedy world. Thirsty shine.</v>

154
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.080
<v 0>Just calling me an actor. You know what I mean? By letting me know,</v>

155
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:09.410
you know what dude you say other people's lines, dude.

156
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:16.370
<v 1>He performed at the chemo theater. I know. I look like a tired Eagle.</v>

157
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.820
Um, I don't like how you laughed at dad. To be honest,

158
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.100
it was his second time in Albuquerque.

159
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:25.670
But something on this visit left a bad taste in his mouth.

160
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.060
<v 0>Writes that, you know, it's amazing.</v>

161
00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:33.470
But something about this visit left a bad taste in his mouth.

162
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:38.270
By the way, they've shown the theater in this video, 14 times so far,

163
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:43.280
get more footage. So much of this from the top, dude,

164
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.650
this is such a news to get the top of the theater and then come down

165
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:51.470
at the chemo theater.

166
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.730
But something left a bad taste in this comedian's mouth.

167
00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:01.370
He tweeted on Twitter that Albuquerque wasn't good.

168
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:05.450
We've talked to some of the locals to see what they have to say.

169
00:11:05.451 --> 00:11:09.080
Always panning down. Dude. Just show it.

170
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.650
You don't have more footage just because you're moving the camera.

171
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:17.270
We can tell dude, guess what? Every time they do this too,

172
00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.580
they come down and there's a parts.

173
00:11:19.581 --> 00:11:24.410
Plus auto parts car drive by same footage.

174
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:29.000
Also parts plus auto parts. If parts is in your title twice,

175
00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:34.280
change it parts. Plus auto parts. Come on down to parts.

176
00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.710
Plus auto parts where well parts.

177
00:11:36.711 --> 00:11:40.220
If your parts and parts that'll be parts. 50 plays

178
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.120
parts. Plus auto parts, dude,

179
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:49.400
too many PS

180
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:57.550
parts, auto parts plus parts of partum, depression, parts, pardon? Put plots,

181
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:03.730
the parts, parts, dude. Get it together. Albuquerque.

182
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:08.950
You have a auto place called parts plus auto parts and also

183
00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:12.520
a theater named after cancer.

184
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:19.540
Dude. Even death Valley is like, we wouldn't have done that.

185
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.090
What? Even Regina Saskatchewan is like, wow,

186
00:12:25.091 --> 00:12:29.470
they up with their titles and we rhyme with vagina,

187
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:34.090
dude. Regina, are you kidding me?

188
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:39.310
That's like naming your city parks, puck suckers.

189
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:49.540
Hey guys, where are you from? Puck suckers. Wait, what?

190
00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:54.700
Like did you say suckers? No. I said pock suckers. That's a place.

191
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.510
Cause Regina is a place I got to start over the thing.

192
00:12:58.511 --> 00:13:01.000
And now the ad's not working great because been because I waited too long

193
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:01.893
because the,

194
00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.800
because Albuquerque is obviously in some sort of deficit that now I have to

195
00:13:05.801 --> 00:13:09.100
watch another ad for the overhead door.

196
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.620
It's it's it's

197
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:19.120
it's it's. The overhead door is what this company is called. Dude.

198
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:24.820
Japanese steak. Just look at these places. Years of tradition in serving hot,

199
00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:29.260
fresh and authentic. Look at these places in Albuquerque, exotic flavors,

200
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:33.040
fresh choices. Oh, fresh choices,

201
00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:35.830
fresh choices.

202
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:40.290
<v 1>Good afternoon. Albuquerque has been a punching bag for a few celebrities.</v>

203
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:42.180
They've made their way through town.

204
00:13:42.181 --> 00:13:47.040
The latest a well-known comedian who bashed the city after playing Getty city

205
00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:48.203
owned treasure,

206
00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:52.380
the chemo new thirteens Rebecca Atkins is live there with what he said and

207
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:58.770
bonded by Rebecca. Well, Kim, according to the ticket sales,

208
00:13:58.771 --> 00:14:02.730
this is where Christa Leah performed at last Thursday. But while he was here,

209
00:14:02.731 --> 00:14:05.100
he had some sort of a bad experience.

210
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:08.430
<v 0>Okay.</v>

211
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:12.480
<v 1>And Thursday night he performed at the chemos theater.</v>

212
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.390
<v 0>I mean, I hate this joke. I don't like how you laughed at dads.</v>

213
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.120
<v 1>It was his second time in Albuquerque,</v>

214
00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:25.230
but something on this visit left a bad taste in his mouth about

215
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:31.830
his performance downtown. He took to Twitter to take a jab at Albuquerque sane.

216
00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:33.840
I've been to some blank fools,

217
00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.860
but surely God you make Jacksonville look like paradise.

218
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:42.690
The post has been retweeted almost 600 Jacksonville look like

219
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:43.390
paradise.

220
00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:48.240
<v 0>Imagine it for that's the way I wish he said, bro, Albuquerque,</v>

221
00:14:48.241 --> 00:14:51.920
you know, I wish you said that part. You make Jack. She didn't say that holes.

222
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:55.580
<v 1>But good afternoon Albuquerque. Huh?</v>

223
00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:56.883
<v 0>Dude.</v>

224
00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:01.840
<v 1>Perky scene. I've been to some blank holes,</v>

225
00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.890
but Holy God you make Jacksonville look like paradise.

226
00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.170
The post has been retweeted almost.

227
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:11.410
<v 0>God. You know what, man? I wish I said something besides a paradise.</v>

228
00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:13.570
Just so they had to, before I put the tweet out, I was like,

229
00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:16.030
what's better than parrot. What's a funnier thing than paradise. But I was like,

230
00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:18.850
Oh, who gives a? Paradise is what everybody knows. I wish I,

231
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.370
I wish I was more creative now that they said it.

232
00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:25.930
It would have been so much better. You know what I mean?

233
00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:30.310
Albuquerque it, Oh, he took to Twitter and said,

234
00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:32.320
I've been to some blank holes,

235
00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:36.850
but Holy God you make Jacksonville look like the inside of a

236
00:15:36.851 --> 00:15:37.684
sloshy.

237
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:46.870
You make Jacksonville look like it makes the sound slosh. When it walks.

238
00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.130
<v 2>Times. I just thought that was pretty rude of him.</v>

239
00:15:51.131 --> 00:15:55.120
It was kind of unnecessary to bash a place that you're

240
00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:56.793
attending.

241
00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:00.040
<v 1>We spoke to weren't too happy about what he said.</v>

242
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:05.050
<v 2>Unnecessary too. I just thought that was pretty rude of him.</v>

243
00:16:05.051 --> 00:16:09.040
It was kind of unnecessary to bash a place that you're

244
00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:10.540
attending.

245
00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:15.100
<v 1>The people we spoke to. Weren't too happy about what he said. It's pretty crazy.</v>

246
00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:18.820
<v 0>They don't give a people. We talked to weren't so happy.</v>

247
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:22.083
Oh.

248
00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.210
<v 2>I mean I've courteous. Not that bad.</v>

249
00:16:25.211 --> 00:16:27.130
You just got to go to like the good parts of it.

250
00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.850
<v 0>Albuquerque is not bad that bad. You just gotta go to the good parts of it.</v>

251
00:16:30.851 --> 00:16:33.700
You know what? The good parts of Albuquerque are Los Angeles.

252
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:36.820
<v 1>But her people had mixed feelings.</v>

253
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:41.620
This person listed off Albuquerque staples like green chili and the Sandias

254
00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:42.401
and said,

255
00:16:42.401 --> 00:16:47.260
what more could you want others agreed with Dalea with one person saying

256
00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:51.340
they're from here and should be offended, but then said you're right.

257
00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.110
Hashtag passed the meth.

258
00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.850
<v 0>Hashtag passed the meth. And I'm fine.</v>

259
00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:02.590
<v 1>Shortly after that tweet,</v>

260
00:17:02.591 --> 00:17:07.510
he posted again saying Albuquerque and Jacksonville crowds are awesome though.

261
00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:08.373
Actually.

262
00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:12.970
But some people feel posts like that could scare Taurus away.

263
00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.340
They're probably not going to want to come here now.

264
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.970
<v 2>It's like, you should probably apologize for that.</v>

265
00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:25.660
<v 1>We also reached down to Albuquerque is tourism department.</v>

266
00:17:25.661 --> 00:17:27.400
They say the post is unfortunate,

267
00:17:27.401 --> 00:17:30.700
but they'd like to know if something set Dalea off while he was here.

268
00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:35.110
They do say however they're appreciative of all the locals that stood up for the

269
00:17:35.111 --> 00:17:37.330
city came back to you. Okay. Thanks for Becca.

270
00:17:37.331 --> 00:17:40.270
Now we also reached to out to Dalea through his Twitter.

271
00:17:40.271 --> 00:17:41.740
We have not yet heard back.

272
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:45.250
He did have some nice things to say about Santa Fe in Twitter,

273
00:17:45.251 --> 00:17:47.230
after performing at the Lensic.

274
00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:52.050
<v 0>Just so many, just keep and. We wonder what he thinks about Seattle.</v>

275
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:57.830
Just like, okay. You know, also said to cliff hanger,

276
00:17:57.831 --> 00:17:58.664
how they left it.

277
00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.070
Although we did have some nice things to say about Santa Fe, by the way,

278
00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.890
she's saying that at the end in the background,

279
00:18:06.891 --> 00:18:11.330
the next news is I swear to God the next segment, it says child shot.

280
00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:31.550
How did I beat out that story?

281
00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:37.850
One of Albuquerque zone slain,

282
00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.500
but I tweeted. It was a blank hall.

283
00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:49.430
Maybe Albuquerque.

284
00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:52.850
That's the problem.

285
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:57.140
Start from there.

286
00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:02.300
Rename your theater and then move on.

287
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:12.740
How on earth is that a thing?

288
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.760
When I saw it, I laughed wholeheartedly, dude.

289
00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:19.640
I laughed so hard when I was like, Oh my God, dude,

290
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:25.430
people are literally sliding into my DMS with these emojis. you, bro.

291
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:28.040
Don't come back to New Mexico. Hey, guess what, man?

292
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:32.540
I didn't say anything about New Mexico. I love New Mexico.

293
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.350
Santa Fe Bichon Albuquerque

294
00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:42.800
shocks. Also I will come back.

295
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:46.370
I love the crowds. The crowds in Albuquerque are awesome.

296
00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:48.860
The people in Albuquerque are awesome.

297
00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:53.540
Stop naming your theaters after cancer. That's all

298
00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.850
also I don't even really give a. I'm sure it's a great place.

299
00:19:58.851 --> 00:20:02.960
I was there for eight hours twice. I'm sure it's fine.

300
00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:09.650
How could you get upset about somebody saying something like that?

301
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:11.450
I mean, I'm not talking about the people in the news.

302
00:20:11.451 --> 00:20:13.520
Obviously they know even the newscasters are like, uh,

303
00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.390
this is what we're reporting on it.

304
00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:19.310
Like is this between this and one of the kids we got got shot. Well,

305
00:20:19.311 --> 00:20:22.610
let's lead with the let's lead with the more depressing story

306
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.680
anyway.
