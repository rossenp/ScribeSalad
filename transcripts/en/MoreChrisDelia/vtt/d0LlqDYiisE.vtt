1
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:02.820
<v 0>I should write a book, dude.</v>

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.950
<v 1>Um, anyway, ah.</v>

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.060
<v 0>Was a little bit sick because I was doing my shows and traveling all over</v>

4
00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:12.894
creation.

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.070
<v 2>Dude. You know what happens? You know what happens too much, man. Look,</v>

6
00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:20.850
here's the deal, man. Either make it so I can watch movies.

7
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.890
<v 1>No. Okay. So if I'm on a plane, make it.</v>

8
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.760
So there's two options you got here,

9
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.760
planes don't.

10
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.350
<v 2>Turn on the back of the TV head rest until after the plane takes</v>

11
00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:38.184
off.

12
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.980
<v 1>Or make.</v>

13
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.590
<v 2>It so I can watch movies. Right? When I sit down,</v>

14
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.220
when I board the plane and shut the.

15
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.450
<v 1>Up over the PA. Okay. There's.</v>

16
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.880
<v 2>The amount of things that flight attendants say when you</v>

17
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.540
board the plane is absolutely asinine.

18
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.350
Is it all good? Now, dude, you sit down. Well,

19
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.860
we have to, Hey guys, if we can do a crunch back for four where you know,

20
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.770
you got to put it back forward because you know, if you don't do, you know,

21
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.740
you've got to make sure it goes in it on the top of the thing.

22
00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:17.900
If you don't get it to her yet, this is for the first day.

23
00:01:17.901 --> 00:01:18.800
And then what we do is you,

24
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.900
you gotta sit down in the thing and move all the way to,

25
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.060
unfortunately it's a full flat, all right, dude.

26
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.040
I'm trying to watch Spider-Man farm from home, dude. Do you,

27
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.630
do you understand me? Okay. So the vine, so then say all the.

28
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.250
Well, you can get rewards code, you get rewards, Platypus wards codes.

29
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:38.750
You can get rewards.

30
00:01:38.751 --> 00:01:42.830
If you just sign up for the rewards codes and then wifi fly Phi PI Phi,

31
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.500
and then awards codes, and then make-up or Decker,

32
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.130
flag chime and put your seat pack and a flag champ. All right, fine.

33
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.540
I'm trying to watch Spider-Man far from home.

34
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.850
So then make it,

35
00:01:55.851 --> 00:02:00.440
so you say all this and then the flight takes off and

36
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.600
then I could turn on.

37
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.153
<v 1>Pokemon.</v>

38
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.290
<v 2>Dude. The only time like it, you can tell I'm on a flight.</v>

39
00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:13.910
If I'm watching Pokemon, I turned on Pokemon, dude.

40
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.911
It's so weird.

41
00:02:16.911 --> 00:02:21.170
How like flights we'll have like the movies that you can choose and there'll be

42
00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:22.280
like a bunch of new releases.

43
00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:24.470
And then all of a sudden it'll be like a rear window.

44
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.370
Why the would you have rear window on.

45
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.770
<v 1>Jet blue? Well, what.</v>

46
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.060
<v 2>Kind of cinephile is going to be like, oh yeah, it's in my,</v>

47
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.070
if who the is going to watch rear window. Oh yeah.

48
00:02:40.071 --> 00:02:42.560
So it's been a while since I've seen that Hitchcock movie,

49
00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:46.100
I'd love to see it in a four inch screen. Dude.

50
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.160
The only person who's watching rear window, first of all,

51
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.980
is watching it in theater or at home.

52
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.380
Nobody would ever watch a movie that a cinephile would watch in a

53
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.190
on the back of the headrest. Oh cool. Are they got eat too?

54
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.730

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.110
<v 1>They've got? What's that movie that they would have.</v>

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.130
<v 2>Oh, they've got a, oh dude. They've got a Fellini collection. Oh,</v>

59
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:27.490
well let me watch it on the back of someone's head.

60
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.280
Oh, they've gotten the Dolce Vita or whatever the it's called. Oh dude,

61
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.950

Let me watch it while I'm eating cashews, dude like this, ah.

66
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.130
<v 0>This is the part where he tries to the 14 year old.</v>

67
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.500
<v 2>And shut the up while I'm trying to watch it, do it. And if you want to have,</v>

68
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.690
and we're just here to, and we're welcoming you and you're welcome. Welcome.

69
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.870
We just want to welcome you while you walk into the thing and remember you can

70
00:04:12.871 --> 00:04:15.420
choose to fly wherever you want to choose to this effect that you chose.

71
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.830
I chose you.

72
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.100
Why are you doing another commercial on the when I'm already riding the

73
00:04:20.101 --> 00:04:24.480
commercial? It's so annoying, dude. [inaudible]

74
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.530
dude, I'm trying to watch Aqua man

75
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.420
chill, man. And then the hallways, the hunky Dory,

76
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.110
put your seatbelts on video comes on in the middle of, you know, you're getting,

77
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.230
you're just starting to get into the drop or whatever.

78
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.910
You're watching the drop with, uh, Tom Hardy and James Gandolfini.

79
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.100
And then all of a sudden it's like,

80
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.290
hi, we know here at American airlines, you can choose any flight.

81
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.500
So what we want to do is make sure you're the most safety Falcons.

82
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:02.700
Cause that's the safety first.

83
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.780
Well it's anything. Now we've got, uh,

84
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.390
we've got an ambiguous and then draws you to this person,

85
00:05:12.391 --> 00:05:14.790
buckling up their seatbelts and he's light skinned.

86
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.170
You don't know what race he is. Whoops. You forgot something.

87
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.360
Here's somebody, here's a lady with a short haircut,

88
00:05:21.361 --> 00:05:22.740
handing him a pamphlet on how to do it.

89
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.310
Hey look, we made it funky. There's twins and they sit next to each other,

90
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.410
but they're like one one's eating pretzels. And one's drinking

91
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.250
here at American airlines. We know no matter what your race, gender,

92
00:05:41.251 --> 00:05:45.090
or how tall you are, you can do whatever you want. But we're thankful that you,

93
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.920
if they played us and here,

94
00:05:49.921 --> 00:05:51.960

95
00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.740
Now take your seat. There's a life Fest and there's life. That's another thing.

96
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:02.660
Make sure to always, even though you already know this,

97
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.670
make sure to put it on someone else before.

98
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.940
Make sure you put it on yourself before you put it on and you put it on yourself

99
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.970
first because if you don't and then you die, then the other person dies. Anyway.

100
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.040
That's what we're secretly saying. Even though we don't say

101
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.730
a light-skinned guy woopsy

102
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.670
anyway, enjoy, enjoy Spider-Man far from home

103
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.870
fighting. We're shedding.

104
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.710
Here's the men in black guys dancing around with some life vests.

105
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.550
So annoying dude. Just Lem watch Aqua man.

106
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.020
Oh dude. It's so pretentious that they have LA Dolce Vita in the thing, dude,

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.620

Um, so yeah, so that's all I'm saying. So I flew.
