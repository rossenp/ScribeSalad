00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.300
But you think of someone in a cubicle or you think of someone, you know,

6
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.780
like ups guy, just going through the motions. If you're a

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.200

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.270

141
00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.033
of the Lord.

144
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.560
<v 2>Now I want to, I want to begin by sharing a story that I,</v>

145
00:11:30.561 --> 00:11:33.080
I want to talk to you about. I was many years ago,

146
00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.620
I was many years ago preaching for my friend, Mela, Nikki and I,

147
00:11:36.621 --> 00:11:39.680
we all love Melanie. Kay. She, she she's my,

148
00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:44.390
one of my sweetest friends in the whole world. Well, I went to Denver, Colorado.

149
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:49.880
This was 84, 85. I walked down the aisle.

150
00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.100
I look at a lady. I said, lady bombing.

151
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:58.450
The Lord tells me you have cancer. And she says, no, I don't.

152
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:04.000
I said, yes you do. She said, no, I don't. I said, yes,

153
00:12:04.001 --> 00:12:08.050
you do Charleston. We got into an argument.

154
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.250
Now Melanie is killing on the platform, getting all upset with me killing.

155
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.880
I said, lady, the Lord told me you have cancer. She said, no, I don't. I said,

156
00:12:15.881 --> 00:12:20.350
yes I do. She said, no, I don't. I said yes. And I said, listen.

157
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:20.891
I said,

158
00:12:20.891 --> 00:12:25.510
if I am wrong on God talking to me about you I'll quit the ministry.

159
00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:29.800
I was dead bold. I said,

160
00:12:29.801 --> 00:12:33.700
don't you tell me you don't when the Lord tells me you do.

161
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:39.460
Okay. You're crazy. I said, I am not leaving till you admit you have it.

162
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.413
Oh wow.

163
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:46.600
Because when the Lord speaks to us.

164
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.340
<v 0>That guy is in a relationship.</v>

165
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:54.360
<v 2>We know he's spoke.</v>

166
00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:58.860
<v 0>Look, look, there's all the black people in our like mm that's. Right. Yeah.</v>

167
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:00.750
And the way people are like, okay, well we'll, we'll see.

168
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:05.070
<v 2>And I said to the lady, I said, now lady, I said,</v>

169
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:09.780
or God has not spoken to me or you're lying.

170
00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:15.420
Well, you can imagine the tension in the auditorium by that. Or you're crazy.

171
00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:18.600
Dear Mela NICU was sitting on the platform getting ready.

172
00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.600
<v 0>And the white people go, yes, ma'am.</v>

173
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:25.470
<v 2>Well, she and I talked about this, but anyways, the lady</v>

174
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:31.350
had just heard a preacher who preached on

175
00:13:31.351 --> 00:13:35.910
faith and who said to the congregation,

176
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:39.000
don't confess it.

177
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.190
And now the lady starts to weep too loud.

178
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:47.400
And the whole church heard her say to me,

179
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:52.500
I am not supposed to say it. I am not supposed to say it.

180
00:13:52.501 --> 00:13:54.000
And then I got really angry.

181
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.030
<v 0>That's not lady.</v>

182
00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.090
<v 2>Faith does not deny fact.</v>

183
00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.050
<v 0>Uh, yeah, it does. Actually.</v>

184
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.770
<v 2>He ever came to Jesus and said, I'm not supposed to say it.</v>

185
00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:12.023
Jesus.

186
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:16.890
<v 0>Ah, this moron. What a,</v>

187
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:19.950
just robbing people, you know,

188
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:26.160
robbing poor people of money because they want to believe in something. Well,

189
00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.290
that's not far from what we're doing.

190
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:31.950
