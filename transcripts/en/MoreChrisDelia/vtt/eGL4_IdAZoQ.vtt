WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.130
<v 0>I guess we're done. it. No. Uh, what was that? Oh,</v>

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.090
um, Oh, I told you this. I wanted to,

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.820
this chick came up to me when I was at the coffee bean. I was killing it.

4
00:00:13.821 --> 00:00:17.190
I was drinking iced Americano, you know, always doing that. Yeah. So,

5
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.010
but sometimes I get three shots over ice, but at coffee bean,

6
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.740
they kind of do a good iced Americano. Now here's the thing.

7
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.780
This girl came up to me and she was like, Hey, I'm a,

8
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.310
I'm such a big fan. I'm so nervous. Okay.

9
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.880
But I'm such a big fan. And I just wanted to tell you that. And I said,

10
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.570
Oh my God, thank you so much. That's so sweet of you. She was very sweet.

11
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.130
I was all smiles. And I was like, that's amazing. And,

12
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.840
and she was like, uh, and she was like, uh, yeah,

13
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.450
I actually ran into you, uh,

14
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.150
a few months ago and you even held the door open for me.

15
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.800
And I always thought it was so sweet. So you're a really sweet guy, gentlemen.

16
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.030
Yeah. And I was like, ah, well, you know what? I was like, Hey,

17
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.960
I guess he caught me on a good day. Right. So she says,

18
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.540
Oh, I caught you on a good, okay. Like, Oh wow, cool walks away.

19
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.433
He goes back to her seat.

20
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.820
She's back at her seat and I'm drinking my in Marikana, you know?

21
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.300
And now it's half half done. And I think I'm waiting for my buddy to get there.

22
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.980
Yeah. And then I hear from over my shoulder at her seat,

23
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.680
I guess I caught you on a good day. Oh, she's like harping on it. And I say,

24
00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:36.630
and I turn around and I say, yeah, yeah.

25
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.770
Or whatever, you know, I dunno. And she says, you're an

26
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.060
just like that. And I said,

27
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.220
uh, Oh, what?

28
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.120
And she says, I guess I cut you on a good day. I was like, yeah. You know, like,

29
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.950
you know, like I was just, I don't know. I literally I'm, I,

30
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.720
I pride myself in kind of always at least saying something that keeps the

31
00:02:08.721 --> 00:02:12.320
conversation going, bro. I had no clue what to say.

32
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.980
And I just kind of turned around and went back to my iced Americano.

33
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.360
And I was like, Jesus Christ. Did she stay? Like,

34
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.550
she sat the whole time she was there the whole time. Yeah. She stayed.

35
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.890
She was like 10, 15 feet away from me.

36
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.390
I pride myself on like knowing what's happening when they're

37
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.320
insane. Yeah. I don't even have a, yeah, I know it's on that one.

38
00:02:33.321 --> 00:02:36.440
I don't know either. I don't know either. Um, there is, uh,

39
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.860
th th that's a funny story as it is. Okay. Just because I, you know,

40
00:02:39.861 --> 00:02:42.710
I didn't add anything to it. Just the fact that it happened was funny. Right.

41
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.270
A few things that I didn't say about that happening,

42
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.110
make it a way different story. Oh, this is

43
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.750
[inaudible] or at the end was like, Oh,

44
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.170
and guess what also there's no Harry Potter in the world where that happened.

45
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.030
So, um,

46
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.490
she said she had a really severe, like physical condition.

47
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.440
Like she had a, um, uh, a Walker and she was like,

48
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.180
so, so, so this is why here the door open. Now the scholars in that,

49
00:03:15.181 --> 00:03:17.400
so I'm not that much of a gentleman. It wasn't even that good of a day.

50
00:03:17.401 --> 00:03:18.410
It was just like, you,

51
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.070
can't not open a door for someone who maybe I don't remember. Right. Okay. So,

52
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.060
um, she probably could have got out herself. Didn't have to do it. No.

53
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.170
So I didn't have to do it, but, but maybe it's, you'd argue.

54
00:03:31.171 --> 00:03:34.230
Maybe it's nicer than I did it. I don't know. Right, right, right. Yeah. Uh,

55
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.210
maybe I probably got up out of my seat to do it. I don't know.

56
00:03:36.211 --> 00:03:37.890
I'm not trying to say I'm a good guy, but whatever I'm saying,

57
00:03:37.891 --> 00:03:41.370
you're adding parts that you don't even remember now you're bragging about being

58
00:03:41.371 --> 00:03:44.580
a nice guy too. Right. Aren't even maybe true. Yeah. Yeah.

59
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.273
<v 1>Do you.</v>

60
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.530
<v 0>So I do that made it more confusing or less confusing.</v>

61
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.290
I dunno, because I don't know. I was like, and this is now,

62
00:03:55.291 --> 00:03:59.580
this is why maybe I'm a bad guy. I'm like, well, does she just not know?

63
00:03:59.581 --> 00:04:04.410
Because is her, is her, does this get me in trouble?

64
00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:07.830
But like, it's also her mind effected by this. Like,

65
00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:11.820
is it not just the physical I'm? Sure. Yeah. Yeah. So maybe, maybe now I'm like,

66
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.390
maybe she doesn't know the saying because she definitely doesn't know the

67
00:04:15.391 --> 00:04:19.680
saying, but that could be regardless of, of, uh, either way.

68
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.800
She's so demented to like, sit, I didn't when you texted me,

69
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.590
because you told me that I didn't tell you the part about the thing.

70
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.970
I didn't know the part that there was a gap between you telling her that and her

71
00:04:29.971 --> 00:04:34.500
being an Sol favorite part of the story is imagining her stewing about that and

72
00:04:34.501 --> 00:04:39.430
like unable to deduce that you meant. Yeah. Good things. Yeah. So innocuous,

73
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.080
do you think that because of her physical handicap that has nothing to do with

74
00:04:43.081 --> 00:04:48.060
it? That's the thing, I didn't know. I think her physical handicap has not,

75
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.620
has nothing to do with it. Yeah. I mean, I don't think it may,

76
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.730
it may be does, but my sense is that, look, I'm always like

77
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.050
my interactions with people throughout the course of the day. Yeah.

78
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.520
I'm constantly thinking people are demented. Yeah.

79
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.290
Like, well, Bob Larson, demented people, but even non exorcists. Right.

80
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.100
demented. You know what I mean? They'll figure out ways to get offended.

81
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.380
They'll figure out ways to misconstrue what you're doing or just be really

82
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.050
rude for no reason at all.

83
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.490
And that's part of the reason I wanted to do my podcast because everything uses

84
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.470
me about everything everyone's always doing. Yeah. That is a great example.

85
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.740
So you should have her on the podcast. Yeah. Get her, get her in open dialogue.

86
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.950
I also adheres like the comedian in me, which is like so like that.

87
00:05:42.951 --> 00:05:47.640
But I, and I didn't make this joke, but I thought about if I did make this joke,

88
00:05:47.641 --> 00:05:51.900
it would be when she was came up to me, she was,

89
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.890
I'm so nervous. And I was like,

90
00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.530
and this is such bad joke. But I was like, I was like.

91
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.950
And the fact that even thought it made me feel bad, but I was like,

92
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.580
I wonder if she wasn't as nervous if she would be shaking less.

93
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.550
You know what I mean? Yes. I do know what you're saying.

94
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:16.900
That the fact that I thought that I felt awful. Yeah. Don't feel bad though.

95
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.890
Yeah. Yeah. Because I actually thought, because actually thought I wonder,

96
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.930
because she was like, Oh my God, I'm shaking.

97
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.810
She was like doing you like so much. Yeah.

98
00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.630
And you saying caught me on a good day. Yeah.

99
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.550
Made her go from being a Supreme mega fan to

100
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:39.370
calling you an. Yeah. To you. Yeah. True.

101
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.880
Yeah. That's the biggest leap. Yeah.

102
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:48.370
To go from loving you to think weird thing. Because like,

103
00:06:48.371 --> 00:06:52.600
I felt bad for her. I wanted her to be okay. I wanted, I, you know,

104
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.040
there's a problem right. There shouldn't feel bad for anybody. Anybody. No,

105
00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:58.510
I don't think so. I, you can feel it,

106
00:06:58.511 --> 00:07:01.810
but like you can't put it out in the world. You know what I mean? I wasn't like,

107
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.680
Oh, okay. Well, you know, he did open a door for her though. Yeah. I know.

108
00:07:05.681 --> 00:07:07.300
I don't know, man. I thought a whole thing.

109
00:07:07.301 --> 00:07:10.030
Like I just like what the problem is, the problem is like,

110
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.140
then I started thinking about like the, the world we live in and like,

111
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:18.610
God forbid, like I said, what I just said on Twitter. Yeah. There'll be awful.

112
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.900
It wouldn't be funny. It's not funny that I thought that, but, but,

113
00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.960
but as a comedian, you think of all these bad jokes and you sift them out.

114
00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.930
Right. Then the difference between

115
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.080
like burying yourself on Twitter and not is just literally

116
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:40.450
typing the stuff and putting it in the world because everyone has those up

117
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.120
thought. Oh yeah, yeah. You know? Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

118
00:07:43.121 --> 00:07:46.240
if everyone was always saying what was coming into their mind,

119
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.710
every single person would be, have to be in like a mental institution. Yeah.

120
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:55.570
But isn't that, but isn't that, but that makes me lose. That's crazy to me.

121
00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:59.620
W which part of it like that, you can just think a thought yeah. That,

122
00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:04.570
that everyone's thought this. Yeah. But if you write it on Twitter, you're,

123
00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.860
you're done. Yeah. You're done. You're you're literally done.

124
00:08:08.861 --> 00:08:13.850
We all think that if we wrote it on Twitter, we're done. Right,

125
00:08:13.851 --> 00:08:17.710
right. Right. Especially as like a celebrity. Sure. Just done. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

126
00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.670
yeah, yeah. We should just, we should just say a button. Well,

127
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.170
I think that, yeah, well, yeah. No, I think that, um,

128
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:31.270
it's I literally think that one day, like the Sony hack. Right.

129
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.360
Everything's just going to come out. Yeah. You've said that before,

130
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:37.480
like you're going to have the day where I want it to make a TV show about this.

131
00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:40.930
And, um, I didn't, I didn't ever pitch it,

132
00:08:40.931 --> 00:08:45.310
but I wanted it to be about like the day that that

133
00:08:45.311 --> 00:08:46.144
happens.

134
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:50.800
Everybody's email and texts and

135
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.670
everything is just available because that day is going to happen. Yeah. I agree.

136
00:08:54.671 --> 00:08:56.820
Yeah. And, and,

137
00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:01.400
and then we're going to live in a very different yeah.

138
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.330
Because people like legitimately Barack Obama. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

139
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:09.830
He's, I mean, there's no way he hasn't texted, like, let me see your. Yeah.

140
00:09:09.831 --> 00:09:13.550
Yeah. And, and guaranteed by Barack Obama has texted at least once.

141
00:09:13.551 --> 00:09:18.320
Let me see your tickets. Yeah. Yeah. You know? Yeah, yeah.

142
00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.191
Yeah. I mean,

143
00:09:19.191 --> 00:09:23.330
that's going to have to change everyone's judgment of everyone else. Yeah.

144
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:28.700
For sure. You know, you're gonna have to like all, let me see your. Yeah.

145
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:33.770
Now folks, folks, let me see your in an orgy

146
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:40.580
with just a, uh, a button-down and a tie and a blazer and no pants.

147
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.540
I didn't have time to take the whole thing off book, Obama.

148
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:50.570
So worst joke. Even worse than the off-color joke that I didn't do. Right.

149
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.800
I mean, the things that you're talking about,

150
00:09:51.801 --> 00:09:55.760
the things that we think about in conversation that just popped into our minds.

151
00:09:55.761 --> 00:10:00.500
Yeah. I'll, they'll often be like violent for me. Um, yeah. Like with you,

152
00:10:00.501 --> 00:10:01.334
I'll be like,

153
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.260
thinking about like ripping your throat out and it's all good, but bad breath,

154
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.780
but I don't do ever thought that about you by the way. And it's all good,

155
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.110
but okay. Well now I feel bad. Yeah. Even though I shouldn't, but like,

156
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:14.960
but it's probably, honestly, honestly,

157
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.810
it's probably because you're my younger brother and I'm your older brother

158
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.600
because you, well, it's not psychoanalyze. No, I'm not. Because I feel like I,

159
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.881
I,

160
00:10:22.881 --> 00:10:26.360
there is a part of me where I feel like I would take care of you no matter what.

161
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.740
And that's because you're my younger brother, honestly,

162
00:10:27.741 --> 00:10:32.320
you're making me feel so bad and it's all going. It's just like, no, no, no.

163
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.720
It's okay. Because you want to kill me because that's, that's a thing.

164
00:10:35.721 --> 00:10:37.910
It's like a 14 brothers hat. They want to be the,

165
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.910
and I get it and it's not chill out though. I would let you know.

166
00:10:40.911 --> 00:10:43.850
How bad do you feel? Definitely chill out though. But like, even like,

167
00:10:43.851 --> 00:10:47.630
just like, if I'm like ordering a bagel, you know, like, like what if I just,

168
00:10:47.631 --> 00:10:52.430
like, I want to like spit in this person's face, you know,

169
00:10:52.431 --> 00:10:56.090
just like constant barrage of that. Barack Obama. Brazo mama

170
00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.620
folks. I want to spit in your face. Yeah.

171
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.590
Why is he Southern when you do it folks? Why is he on a King of the Hill?

172
00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:07.550
Listen, I don't want to spit in your face. Um, so, um,

173
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.550
Oh boy, it's a hot one out, huh?
