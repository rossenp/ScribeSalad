00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.820
<v 0>And a lot of you guys are passing along. You don't even know it yet.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.470
I might have it. I might have it. I don't think I have it, but I might have it.

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.880
You know what? I don't even not think I have it. Do you know why?

4
00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:13.160
Because I heard that Aegis Elba. Got it.

5
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.900
So that means that sexy guys can get it. So it's like,

6
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.550
I thought maybe I was immune. Cause I'm tall, dude. I'm a tall drink of water.

7
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.200
You know, he drew his album,

8
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.560
got it from all of his DJ sets that he's been doing to cause he's been to and

9
00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:31.070
too many DJ sets, but that sucks, man,

10
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.930
word up to Idris Elba gave a great message out on Twitter was very

11
00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:40.580
positive about it. No pun intended. But uh, and then Tom Hanks to man,

12
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.180
two of Tom Hanks, America's sweetheart and Aegis Elba, man.

13
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.940
That's that's that's rough. I love Hydra Silva, L Elba. And I love Tom Hanks,

14
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.520
but the, you know, when Tom Hanks got it, I was like, okay,

15
00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:55.610
he's more of an every man, but when EGIS Elba got it, I'm like, Oh great,

16
00:00:55.611 --> 00:01:00.470
sexy guys can get it. I'm Corona virus.

17
00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:04.160
Doesn't they don't give a if you make panties wet. Oh, dude.

18
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.540
They don't care how many towels you have to pass out. Ah, for sake, dude.

19
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.453
Oh great.

20
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.300
So now I got to just chill in doors. I'm indoors dude, and I'm keeping it cool.

21
00:01:17.301 --> 00:01:21.400
And every, every, every five seconds I feel do I feel even dude,

22
00:01:21.401 --> 00:01:24.200
the crazy thing is I've been leaving it on CNN and also Fox news.

23
00:01:24.201 --> 00:01:27.470
I flipped back and forth. Cause baby, I'm not, you know what I mean? I like to,

24
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.990
I like to get the whole picture. I like take some CNN. I take some Fox news.

25
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.640
I put it together and I did just what I had to do because I'm real person. Okay.

26
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.310
And then when I do that, there's so much going on about the,

27
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.650
uh, what do you call it? Um, coronavirus that, then I start thinking, Oh,

28
00:01:48.651 --> 00:01:51.320
I have a cough. Even though I don't have a cough and I haven't coughed,

29
00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:54.260
I think I'll have a cough. Uh,

30
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.700
so that just proves to you how crazy I am and how the media can get to you.

31
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.010
Uh, so thanks a lot media. But yeah,

32
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.020
I love how people still think and not a big deal. Don't worry about it. I don't,

33
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.020
I'm not showing symptoms. Like it's not a problem.

34
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.650
You can get it and then it do this. Anything else? You get it.

35
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.950
And then in four days you get sick. That's how the flu is.

36
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.380
If you shake someone's hands with the flu, you don't go, Oh,

37
00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:24.620
I have a fever immediately. Dude, you go home, you chill a little bit.

38
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.740
You watch some Netflix, you wake up the next morning. All things are good.

39
00:02:27.741 --> 00:02:30.530
You go get a Starbucks and you spread it a little bit.

40
00:02:30.531 --> 00:02:31.850
And then you come back home.

41
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.020
And then later on that night you feel a little fatigue, but you're like,

42
00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:37.310
maybe it'll be pass them and get some sleep.

43
00:02:37.311 --> 00:02:40.580
And then the next day you wake up and it sucks. Babies.

44
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.680
<v 1>But life still rips, man.</v>

45
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.180
<v 0>You have to keep that in the back of your head.</v>

46
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.930
Okay. Because I can't handle another famous actor getting this Corona virus,

47
00:02:56.931 --> 00:02:59.860
man. I thought maybe it will be cool if I was the first one,

48
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.220
because then I would get more press. But I'm not, it's fine, Tom Hanks, ESL,

49
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:06.460
but they got it. And maybe it could be third,

50
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.280
but yeah, we're coming at you responsibly, man, uh,

51
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.450
with the, with the, with the mask on. Uh,

52
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.310
but I love how just some people,

53
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.900
just some people how they think it's a hoax and is just out of control.

54
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.620
Some people think here, where's the thing.

55
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.630
Now this idiot Janna Abraham, Abraham corsets, her name,

56
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:34.240
widest name of all time, Janet Abraham

57
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.470
and uh, downtown Nashville is undefeated. And then,

58
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.453
and then.

59
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.360
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

61
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.310

<v 0>Yeah. I don't give a what goes on down by the river or you know.</v>

63
00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.310
<v 1>Down by the river in the. And I'm Robin.</v>

64
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.450
<v 0>Freaks in a break-ins in a Verena. My brains do it. I don't give a.</v>

65
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.740
Take off your cowboy hat, cowboy hat, go home. Pick up your cowboy hat,

66
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.590
put on a face mask and goggles go home.

67
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.150
Nashville's undefeated got news for you Gina. In two weeks,

68
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.560
Nashville going to be defeated. Cause this is the Corona virus.

69
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.770
This isn't a baseball team.

70
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.770
Just be responsible, dude. Oh, I love the people. Look, Janet left that up too.

71
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.753
She didn't give a.

72
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.430
Heck of a job, Tennessee. Somebody writes, it's not tennis. I love T I,

73
00:04:38.431 --> 00:04:41.430
you know, Tennessee's cool, but it's just.

74
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.653
<v 1>Man.</v>

75
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.060
<v 0>Current crowds at the magic kingdom for tonight's showing of happily ever after</v>

76
00:04:51.061 --> 00:04:55.890
last, last night, Disney world. I mean so many people

77
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.540
They say you're supposed to hold your breath for 10, 10 seconds and you go

78
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.600
And if you cough, you're. I didn't cough. yeah.

79
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:20.310
<v 1>Oh.</v>

80
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.050
<v 0>Yeah dude. I'm good. So I'm good. I don't have it. I'll try again and you know,</v>

81
00:05:25.051 --> 00:05:29.460
a little bit, but uh, one farmer is doing it. If he coughs he's out,

82
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.780
go leave. Um, see that's the thing now I feel like,

83
00:05:33.781 --> 00:05:38.040
I think I have to cough and then I, but I don't dude. It's my OCD.

84
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:44.130
<v 1>Um.</v>

85
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.580
<v 0>So anyway, uh, eater, Salba. Got it. Tom Hanks. Got it.</v>

86
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:50.850
It's just brutal, dude.

87
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.650
Well get better quick Tom Hanks and eaters Elba. I love you guys.

88
00:05:55.651 --> 00:06:00.440
I think you're awesome. And I really hope that you guys, well,

89
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:02.870
you'll make it through because you're you guys. I mean, you guys,

90
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.630
you're going to have the best medical, although the guy, well, I don't want to,

91
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:06.980
I don't, you know what? I'm not going to get into it.

92
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.430
The guy who was the head of the thing in Italy, he died, but all good. No,

93
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:12.800
I mean, he obviously got the best medical attention and he died,

94
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:15.110
but it's all good. I, you know, I feel bad. He was only 50 something,

95
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:16.520
but it's all good. But so anyway.

96
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.943
<v 1>Um.</v>

97
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.390
<v 0>We are self quarantining, quarantining, my babies. We're doing it, man.</v>

98
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:26.770
And you got it too.

99
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.860
Cause that's what cause life's ripping and you got to keep making sure life

100
00:06:29.861 --> 00:06:31.570
rips. So stay in doors for two weeks.

101
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.210
If we stayed indoors for two weeks and then we got out of doors,

102
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.220
it will be fine, but you guys are going to be, you're going to be,

103
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.163
we're going to be bored, dude.

104
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.110
I've been quarantined for two days and I'm bored as.

105
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.140
I've watched a documentary on Wells Fargo last night. I mean I do. Hey,

106
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.360
listen to me, dude. Look at me, look at me,

107
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:54.430
look at me in the YouTube chits. And if you're not, if you're listening to it,

108
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:59.500
I want you to take your fingers and push on your headset or

109
00:06:59.501 --> 00:07:00.550
whatever the hell you got. You got those,

110
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.790
those AirPods that come out all the time when you jump.

111
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.860
Cause I jump a lot because I do lots of cardio, but I want you to listen to me,

112
00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:13.690
dude. I've been self, self quarantining, quarantining. that. You know what dude,

113
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.470
I've been staying indoors. that word. Okay. But I'm telling you right now.

114
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.710
Look at me in the YouTube. Make eye contact with me.

115
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.560
I'm so bored. I watched a documentary on Wells Fargo last night.

116
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.750
Okay. So this is what I'm doing for the.

117
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.860
All right, this is what I'm doing for the country.

118
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.210
So if I'm sitting at home watching a Wells Fargo documentary,

119
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:44.830
you guys can do it too. Or at least sit at home and like play Jenga with people.

120
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.040
But, but, but people who are in your circle, you know,

121
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.790
maybe gender is not the best because you got to touch everything.

122
00:07:51.791 --> 00:07:52.624
But you know what I mean?

123
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:59.500
It's a self quarantine special from, uh, congratulations,

124
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.990
log cabin. Uh,

125
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.070
I'm glad they canceled Coachella,

126
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.380
even though that's the place they should have kept open because those people

127
00:08:08.381 --> 00:08:09.214
deserve to all.

128
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.560
<v 1>Um, anyway, uh.</v>

129
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:13.991
<v 0>It's all good.</v>

130
00:08:13.991 --> 00:08:17.200
You should definitely not go to Coachella because you don't want to get the

131
00:08:17.201 --> 00:08:18.520
coronavirus. But if you did,

132
00:08:18.521 --> 00:08:20.770
wouldn't wouldn't really be the end of the world because those are the people

133
00:08:20.771 --> 00:08:21.520
that should.

134
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.050
<v 1>Get it anyway.</v>

135
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.850
<v 0>And specifically the people in stagecoach also don't care.</v>

136
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.760
<v 1>So that's so anyway, uh.</v>

137
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.500
<v 0>Or anywhere they play this song. Oh dude,</v>

138
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.680
this. I'm going to the strip club after this and getting it. I don't give a.

139
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:44.440
Give me a lap dance. Let me cough, baby.

140
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.900
Give me a lap dance and watch me cough in two weeks.

141
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.450
<v 1>Oh, ah, ah dude. Hey baby.</v>

142
00:08:52.451 --> 00:08:53.470
Here's $20.

143
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:58.590
<v 0>Show me your. Yeah dude.</v>

144
00:08:58.770 --> 00:08:59.880
We did not stop.

145
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:04.140
We make sure people get content no matter what,

146
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.600
I will reschedule the shows,

147
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.470
but we make sure that we make content for people.

148
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:13.950
I might go out and get a book deal for y'all because I need to keep making this

149
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:18.510
money and bags need to keep coming in. I'll write a book.

150
00:09:18.511 --> 00:09:21.990
You think I won't write a book. I'll write a book anyway.

151
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.810
I'm slowly losing my mind. It's been one day next week.

152
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.960
I'll be quarantined for one week and then next week I'll be quarantined for two

153
00:09:27.961 --> 00:09:32.160
weeks. Oh my God. For real, I will be nuts.

154
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:34.830
Anyway, dude, who, um,

155
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:42.150
what was I trying to say about the Italy's been killing it though. It,

156
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:46.530
you can't make, here's the thing about Italians.

157
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.600
There's so emotional

158
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.780
that they're either going to turn it into the worst thing or the best thing.

159
00:09:55.650 --> 00:10:00.390
And they figured out how to turn it into the best thing. I mean, dude, Italy,

160
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:05.490
there's videos of out, out there where people are just singing from rooftops

161
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.470
and just, and like from their apartments are all opened up facing each other.

162
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:11.873
And they're just like.

163
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:17.593
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

164
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.040
<v 0>And people are just like,</v>

165
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.490
[inaudible] There's guys out there for real, with trumpets and harps,

166
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:28.423
you know.

167
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.713
<v 2>[Inaudible] guys.</v>

168
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.770
<v 0>That's the most Italian thing to take a tragedy and turn it into the most</v>

169
00:10:36.771 --> 00:10:37.604
beautiful.

170
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.200
Everybody in Italy shed one tear.

171
00:10:42.201 --> 00:10:45.140
When they found out the Corona virus was there and then they go like this,

172
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:46.400
get my trumpet.

173
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:52.970
At the least we can, at least we kind of sing that.

174
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.370
That is the most Italian thing you can possibly say it.

175
00:10:57.371 --> 00:11:00.230
At least it cannot stop me from singing

176
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.080
opened the window. That's what happened when Italy,

177
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.310
when Italy found out that they were going to get the Corona virus,

178
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.750
they go like this, they shed

179
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:19.940
The shed one tear and then they go like this, open the window.

180
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.990
And that's the most Italian thing of all time. And now let me tell you why,

181
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.840
because you let the emotion hit yet. It'll let it sink in.

182
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:32.030
You let that one tear shed out and then you make it from the most emotional,

183
00:11:32.031 --> 00:11:35.840
sad thing. And you turn it to the most emotional, beautiful thing.

184
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:37.910
Thinking at least I can still sing.

185
00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:41.210
And you say open at the window and now let me tell you why it's even more at a

186
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.660
time because the man is saying that to the woman and he wants a woman to open

187
00:11:44.661 --> 00:11:49.100
the window for him. That's why, because he's like you do it,

188
00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:54.790
do things for me so I can give people my gift. Hello,

189
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:58.630
lesser than open at the window. And then she opens it. Yes.

190
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.590
And she opens it and he just steps outside.

191
00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.553
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

192
00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:15.540
<v 0>And then some guy goes like this, what is that downstairs? Well, what is that?</v>

193
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:21.000
And then she says, they're singing. And then he says why?

194
00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:22.343
And then she says,

195
00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:27.540
apparently the Corona virus has come to Italy and he sheds one tear from

196
00:12:27.541 --> 00:12:29.160
the other eye to make it even,

197
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:34.530
and then he says open at the window and then he steps out.

198
00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:43.710
<v 2>[Inaudible] you know, that song</v>

199
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.900
that they always played during some sad. Or if someone gets married

200
00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:57.630
[inaudible].

201
00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:00.870
<v 0>What's that one? That's the cat song, dude. But they're singing it in Italian.</v>

202
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.610
And then, and then dude, and then one guy says,

203
00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:10.020
what is that from [inaudible]? And she says, they're singing.

204
00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.870
And he says why? And she says,

205
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:17.850
because apparently the coronavirus is in Italy now. And then he said,

206
00:13:17.851 --> 00:13:19.440
and then they say that he says,

207
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.510
and then he lets two tiers down from both eyes because he realizes two people

208
00:13:24.511 --> 00:13:26.580
are singing and they both know, and it's even more tragic.

209
00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:27.960
And then it goes like this

210
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:35.700
Open at the window. And she said, and she just walks over, slides,

211
00:13:35.701 --> 00:13:38.580
open the door and he walks out, get my trumpet.

212
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:45.600
<v 2>Okay.</v>

213
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.570
<v 0>And then it's beautiful. And then they figured out all the, man.</v>

214
00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:53.460
They figured out after that, they figured out to, there was a workout class.

215
00:13:53.461 --> 00:13:58.260
Some guy was standing on a lower building from the inside of

216
00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.920
surrounded, by a bunch of other buildings. And he was doing workout,

217
00:14:01.921 --> 00:14:05.160
video workout, uh, videos, workout classes,

218
00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:08.790
and everyone was joining him from their patio set stallion.

219
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.230
What's the song. They always sing not the cat song. I sang the cat song,

220
00:14:13.231 --> 00:14:17.820
but let me, let me get the video on YouTube, Italy, Italy,

221
00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:23.250
singing, singing, Corona virus.

222
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.760
Here we go. This is the song they sing always.

223
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.880
First of all, it's so late at night. How annoyed would I be?

224
00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:39.773
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

225
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:57.080
[inaudible] kind of a beautiful thing though. [inaudible].

226
00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:01.840
<v 0>So tone deaf. It's just so blitz. Drunk,</v>

227
00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.880
ate so much pasta and just.

228
00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:06.160
<v 2>Ruined.</v>

229
00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.080
<v 0>It. There's going to be one guy that ruins it. You know,</v>

230
00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:11.620
just some skinny string bean guy too, that everyone's like, God,

231
00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:13.690
that guy is so annoying. But for some reason he can fight.

232
00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:16.780
<v 2>And.</v>

233
00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.630
<v 0>It just, how come every foreign country has a song with Olay in it.</v>

234
00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:25.330
I swear to God every foreign country, that guy would be,

235
00:15:25.331 --> 00:15:28.900
I would be living next to that guy. And I would be like this, dude.

236
00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:32.800
How Italian is it to sing on patios to each other?

237
00:15:32.801 --> 00:15:37.270
When some emotional goes down and I would be the F here's me do it

238
00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.360
now I'm young as. But act like an old guy. Sometimes I'll be like,

239
00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:43.840
they're singing. I turn over to my girl. They're singing. And it's so annoying,

240
00:15:43.841 --> 00:15:47.290
dude. And we got a quarantine and now I can't get sleep and she'd be like,

241
00:15:47.291 --> 00:15:50.740
it's a beautiful thing. And I'd be like, God opened the window.

242
00:15:59.320 --> 00:15:59.530
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

243
00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:01.420
<v 0>Oh, that's that. That's that girl.</v>

244
00:16:01.421 --> 00:16:05.560
That's always that's that girl that talks and get you in a fight at a bar.

245
00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:10.720
Well, that's why he's a fat rotten. That's whole. And you're like, baby,

246
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:14.260
can you? And he's like, what did she saying? Nothing, baby.

247
00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.920
She just had a few drinks. Not with that in mind, boy, he going to beat you up,

248
00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.230
baby, please. And then you're in a fight. That's that girl.

249
00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:22.840
<v 2>And same.</v>

250
00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.700
<v 0>Note, four times, not even trying,</v>

251
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.000
bro. This Corona virus really, really it's

252
00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:35.830
Firing on all cylinders. They were saying that, uh,

253
00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.520
it's not in a virus's best interest to kill, to be high,

254
00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:44.530
to be killing people quickly that it's going to take them a long time to like,

255
00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.010
it stays in you for awhile and then kills you because they want it.

256
00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.010
They want you to go out and to transmit it to other people and, and,

257
00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.950
and its whole goal is to spread. And that.

258
00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:57.613
<v 2>That.</v>

259
00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.630
<v 0>Is the scariest thing that I've ever heard.</v>

260
00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:06.550
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

261
00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:09.730
<v 0>Oh good. So virus is try to just lay in what this is. This is what, uh,</v>

262
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.630
this is a virus right here.

263
00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:15.010
<v 2>Virus just chilling.</v>

264
00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.070
<v 0>And then before you know,</v>

265
00:17:18.071 --> 00:17:22.360
it it's too late and you're sitting on the patio just

266
00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.800
In the meantime she has it probably.

267
00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:32.050
And she's given it to other people in the apartment complex, but it's, you know,

268
00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:38.500
the world's gone mad, but at times figured that man,

269
00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.530
shout out to the Italians. I'm really sorry. That sucks, man.

270
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.030
They were going through a hard time though. For real.

271
00:17:43.031 --> 00:17:44.410
I know there's just a silly goose. This,

272
00:17:44.411 --> 00:17:46.960
this is a silly goose time on this podcast,

273
00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.220
but they're going through a hard time.

274
00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:52.360
I know no dents and this is a silly CO's time and everything, but.
