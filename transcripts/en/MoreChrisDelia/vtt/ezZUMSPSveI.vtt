1
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.480
<v 0>And then it's all good. Uh, D have you seen the, the, uh, the, uh,</v>

2
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.320
the ice cream licking challenge that people are talking about?

3
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.080
They should be calling it the, how long you go to jail for a challenge,

4
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.490
because people just go out, you shoot, you can look this up, you can just dig,

5
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.120
go out. And they have you heard about this? You have, Oh, okay.

6
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.430
I thought I was honest, some new. And they,

7
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.360
they go in to like a Rite aid and they grabbed the, go to the ice cream.

8
00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:31.140
They grab it, open it up, lick it, and then put it back. Dude.

9
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.050
If I saw someone do that, I'd sweep him. I'd sweep them.

10
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.040
I'd sweep them. I do a one of those spins sweeps. And they'd go on there.

11
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.820
They fall down on their. Dude. If I see someone do that, man, sweep them.

12
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.030
If you see someone do that, sweep them, go over the leg.

13
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.320
What's the a sweep. The leg in karate kid. That's me, dude.

14
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.580
I'm going to bring a blonde hair dude in right aides. Look for people like that.

15
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.430
When we see it, I'm going to hear him say, slip the leg,

16
00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:04.590
and I'm going to go for the leg, dude. I'm going to do a spin sweep.

17
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.980
I hope it hurts, dude, because that's you,

18
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.380
you can go to jail for that. That's my practice.

19
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.160
I mean, I know you're not a doctor, but that's my practice.

20
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.610
You might be a doctor maybe doing the ice cream challenge and,

21
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.760
and you are a doctor now that's my practice.

22
00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:28.080
And I will Sue you I'll buy the ice cream, eat it to Sue you. You understand me?

23
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.780
Unless you have a gross mouth. Some people have grosses, mouths. Huh?

24
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.230
You ever talked to somebody and they're talking with their mouth and you're just

25
00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:41.760
like, Whoa, what are you doing? Like, what is going on in there?

26
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.530
You know, like they got weird teeth or like that weird yellow,

27
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.380
like, or like sometimes it's like gray in their mouth. And you're just like,

28
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.300
you feel like you're looking at like, they're like.

29
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.860
Like you D you have to feel that same way. You're like, why did,

30
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.540
why did you show me that? You know,

31
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.200
that's how I feel when sometimes people talk to me and they're,

32
00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:09.240
I'm looking in their mouth talking, and I'm just like,

33
00:02:09.241 --> 00:02:10.710
why are you showing me this?

34
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.940
If someone like dad did the ice that did the ice cream challenge, dude,

35
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.870
Hey, meet the floor. Cause you're getting sweeped. Um,

36
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.350
yeah. Are you some dust?

37
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.270
Cause you're getting sweeped. I'm a janitor. Boom sweep. You're on your

38
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.070
answer. You do it. That's it's just a, yeah. The ice cream challenge.

39
00:02:38.071 --> 00:02:42.270
That's so up. Or, or, or I,

40
00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:44.640
or I would do this from across the way. If I saw you do that, I would go like,

41
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.160
I'll be, I would, I will put my fist up and I will be running towards you.

42
00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:47.820
And I'd be like,

43
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.510
here comes the punch in the face and then boom hit you and you wouldn't.

44
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.190
And I would connect to

45
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.390
either the sweep or here comes a punch in the face,

46
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.640
similar to the ice cream. Oh, Oh, here's another one that he's sending me

47
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.210
get. Oh, Oh yeah. The gallon smashing. This is less bad, but it's real bad.

48
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.790
The gallon Smith. Oh good, good,

49
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.800
good, good. Congratulations. Wow. I just saw a guy do it, bro.

50
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.450
That's the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my life. It's also very,

51
00:03:27.451 --> 00:03:31.500
very white to do that. This is so white gallon smashing compilation.

52
00:03:31.501 --> 00:03:34.320
The first guy takes the gallon, smashing smashes,

53
00:03:34.321 --> 00:03:38.580
the two gallons of milk slips and smashes. His jaw.

54
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.840
We don't even need to sweep this guy.

55
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.430
Oh. I think it broke my jaw. It, no, you know what?

56
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.820
I bet he's from like Austin, Texas and became Irish.

57
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.810
That's how hard he hit his head. He's like, Oh,

58
00:03:57.811 --> 00:04:01.500
y'all want to do the gown set. Smashing can't blame Yondu down.

59
00:04:01.501 --> 00:04:05.880
Smashing what's that boy. Well that's when you take the yo them, uh,

60
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.430
tomorrow take gallon milk. You just smash it on the ground.

61
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.260
The guy says one gallon we're going to do to, I guess is, well, all right,

62
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:14.730
sounds dangerous. But let's do it.

63
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.930
And they go and they do it and they grabbed the two gals and guys remember

64
00:04:18.931 --> 00:04:23.370
record this and does it swung? Boom hit so hard. He's gone. Oh,

65
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.570
brought me Joel, immediate Cockney.

66
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.730
The. Hard to watch. That's really, really,

67
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.240
really hard to watch.

68
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.160
And I've seen SciQuest

69
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.770
joust jousting, dude. You know, it's like with the gallon,

70
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.580
the gallon smashing cup competition.

71
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.720
And then they get in the one time. My brother and I, you know, those, we were,

72
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.350
we were dumb, but we were really young. Uh, you know, those, uh, um,

73
00:05:13.351 --> 00:05:18.120
what do you call them? Uh, uh, coupons, things that you would,

74
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.000
they will be in the aisle and you could just take one and then another one will

75
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.750
pop out my brother and I would collect them.

76
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.340
We would run around the whole stores and open it and it would go, boom.

77
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.130
And then another one where we went around the whole store and then this guy had

78
00:05:29.131 --> 00:05:32.280
his suit. That was, we were in New Jersey, but he was so New Jersey.

79
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.200
He was like, all right guys, all right, fellas, you got to give them to me.

80
00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:36.710
You got to stop doing that. And I was like, here you go. And I felt so bad.

81
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.340
I went back to my mom and was like, mom, we got into a trouble.

82
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.880
He's great. Kids are. You know what? These kids are. They're all rich.

83
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.100
It's like, they got too much, their family has too much money.

84
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.670
It's so not it here's the number one thing.

85
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.770
It's so not worth it. You know?

86
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.150
Like what's the thing. Oh, they gotta clean it up. Okay.

87
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.430
Someone saw you. Uh it's.

88
00:06:12.431 --> 00:06:17.380
So you're basically the guy at the Halloween party that dressed up in the

89
00:06:17.381 --> 00:06:21.010
outfit. That's like, like, uh, you're like,

90
00:06:21.011 --> 00:06:25.630
you're the person who put on a slip and wrote Freud on it. And you're like,

91
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.080
I don't know, like I'm a Freudian slip and this is, and the guy goes, Oh yeah,

92
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.860
that's you, you're the fun guy at the Halloween party. You.

93
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.340
But also you're making, you're putting people out.

94
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.150
Look what I am. Um, you're,

95
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.110
you're dressed as a chicken and you got a cord connected to you to a blue circle

96
00:06:47.111 --> 00:06:52.030
and you're like, look, I'm chicken cord on blue. Oh, cool, man.

97
00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.740
Oh, you made a play on words, Halloween costume dude. You're the first to go

98
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:05.230
look at these gallon smashing. Oh. And then he's hammered it up, falling down,

99
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.750
like, like his Buster Keaton.

100
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.420
So not funny. It's what not funny people do too.

101
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.460
Cause they don't have personalities. So they just

102
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.890
excuse they're slipping. It's not even worth recording, dude.

103
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.400
It's so stupid. All good.

104
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.913
All good.

105
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.510
If I saw someone do that,

106
00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:44.350
I'd take the gallon and throw another gallon on them or just dump it out on him

107
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.130
one time. Oh dude, one time, you know how

108
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.900
you know how, Oh dude, this is how I was as a kid.

109
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.860
One time somebody poured something on my head as like a joke.

110
00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.361
And I was a kid.

111
00:07:58.361 --> 00:08:00.820
I was a kindergarten kid or whatever it was or maybe I was in first or second

112
00:08:00.821 --> 00:08:05.110
grade, bro. This is the kind of kid I was. Okay. So,

113
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:06.521
you know,

114
00:08:06.521 --> 00:08:11.410
on like shows when somebody pours a glass on somebody's

115
00:08:11.411 --> 00:08:11.890
head,

116
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:15.130
they pour a little bit on it and it's real quick and the person just goes like

117
00:08:15.131 --> 00:08:19.150
this and they just sit there. When in real life,

118
00:08:19.151 --> 00:08:22.630
of course you would go like, yo, what the? and grab their hand.

119
00:08:22.631 --> 00:08:24.760
And their cup would go flying and. And we all awkward.

120
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.390
But in movies and TV shows, especially in the eighties,

121
00:08:28.391 --> 00:08:29.410
which was when I was a kid,

122
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.380
somebody would pour some on your head and the person would just go like this.

123
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:37.660
And if they had long hair, they'd go. Right. All right.

124
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.500
So somebody did that to me. I don't remember who it was. I think it was Sumatra.

125
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:46.090
She was like this little girl who in, in my, in my first grade class too,

126
00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.980
that one time we were doing answers in the class room and she was like,

127
00:08:50.981 --> 00:08:54.280
what's another one class. And I was like, I think this is an answer.

128
00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:58.830
And so macho her hand and said my answer. And I go, that was my answer.

129
00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.960
And she said, well, you didn't say it. You should have said it.

130
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:02.610
Then I stole it from you. And I was like, wow,

131
00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:06.690
that's a live lesson from Sumatra who knew, right. I don't what she's doing now.

132
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.250
She's 40. That's crazy. So anyway, um,

133
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.610
somebody did, I think it was a mantra.

134
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.570
She poured something on my head behind me and it was like a big,

135
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:22.790
it wasn't just was like a lot. And I did the thing that they do in movies.

136
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.080
And I go and I waited and she,

137
00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.740
this kept pouring on the and I waited an extra second. I was like,

138
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.710
what are you doing, dude? And she was like, well, why aren't you moving?

139
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:37.430
And I was like to be like the movies.

140
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:41.930
You're just supposed to pour a little bit. And then I let me do my thing.

141
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.010
But life isn't like the movies, you know? And that's when I realized that

142
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.890
when I was eight and so much a, some like a whole power eight on me.

143
00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.620
Um, anyway, how many minutes.
