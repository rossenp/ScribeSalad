00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.090
<v 0>Um, all right, whatever do it. It's fine, man. It's all good.</v>

2
00:00:03.091 --> 00:00:05.730
But he really cleared it because what happens is here is a little BTS on the

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.580
behind the scenes of congratulations podcast. Nevermind. It's not important,

4
00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:11.300
but what is important now? I just remember BT. Yes.

5
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.150
Is that a Asian group? All right, dude. Hey,

6
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.000
are they video games? I've got a question for you.

7
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.670
BTS, are you video games?

8
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.700
The reason why I ask that is because you look like people on final fantasy,

9
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.040
you don't look like actual people. You look like when you move, it goes,

10
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.590
cause that's all did you see?

11
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.400
Oh my I don't and I know their fan base is

12
00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:51.890
voracious and they with you.

13
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.300
And they're so angry at you. If you make fun of them.

14
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.070
And I just want you to know plain and simple and very clearly

15
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.690
I don't give a. You understand me? Do you feel me saying that

16
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.230
first of all, BTS? Well,

17
00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:15.080
the first of all is they look like video games, period.

18
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.750
They look like actual video game characters.

19
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.500
They would be like where they would be like, hello,

20
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.580
would you like to talk to me? And you're just like,

21
00:01:25.581 --> 00:01:29.210
what would you like to talk to me about the village?

22
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.590
I'm sure. Where can I find the disc? Well,

23
00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:36.500
all I know is Jeremy's been talking about it for a long time.

24
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.790
You might want to check with him.

25
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.150
How many times has everyone in the group BTS said this,

26
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.740
you might want to check with him.

27
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.140
He was acting kind of strange.

28
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.210
I'm not sure, but Jeremy was acting kind of strange.

29
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.780
You might want to talk to the stork through that.

30
00:02:04.781 --> 00:02:08.870
How many times I'm BTS. How many members of BTS are there?

31
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:14.510
How many human members in South park,

32
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.150
where the guy goes, human that's held so funny,

33
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.180
but God their video games, dude. I, I,

34
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.680
how were their F they already have, um, plastic surgery, right?

35
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.320
Aren't they like 12? Or are they like, have they been around for a long time?

36
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.210
Oh, this video episode on

37
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.340
why they could dance though. Huh? But that's because they're animated, dude.

38
00:02:43.341 --> 00:02:46.700
There's this one video that this guy keeps, I think it's Brendan Walsh.

39
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.120
Um, let me see. Yeah, I think it's him.

40
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.790
It's so funny. He's my favorite guy to follow on Twitter. Malibu.

41
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.320
What's Brendan Walsh, uh, Malibu, Brendan.

42
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.400
And he keeps tweeting the BTS.

43
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.140
He calls the BTS salami biting, fake out.

44
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.920
And First of all, I was on Fallon tonight.

45
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:21.280
I guess we're one of the guys that he looks like a video game dude,

46
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.970
where he pretends to bite a huge piece of salami.

47
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.450
And then doesn't and like gives the camera wide eyes. Like you faked them out.

48
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.530
And Malibu, Brendan, Brendan wa, which is Brendan while she's a comedian.

49
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:36.100
He's hilarious. And then he writes,

50
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.790
forget about the Corona virus watching BTS boy prank by the salami is

51
00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:41.230
infectious. Have a salami.

52
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.240
I have salami fever and he's done like 40 of these knock knock who's there.

53
00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:49.330
I'm going to bite the salami. I'm going to bite this salami. Who'd JK.

54
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.000
I'm not going to bite the salami. LOL. I thought you were going to bite it.

55
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.380
I know I tricked you BTS salami, biting, fake out.

56
00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.810
You got to look at these. They're really funny.

57
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.020
But the one that made me laugh so hard is probably the first one.

58
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.760
He does not bite that salami in this video.

59
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:13.660
But if any salamis get bitten in the future, he will be the prime suspect.

60
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.753
<v 1>[Inaudible] dude.</v>

61
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.160
<v 0>Right? And that's number 25.</v>

62
00:04:23.161 --> 00:04:26.670
And he writes one fourth of the way to 100 tweets about this BTS salami biting.

63
00:04:26.671 --> 00:04:27.510
Fake-out Jeff.

64
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.440
<v 1>Dude.</v>

65
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.210
<v 0>I, I think he's the funniest guy on Twitter. It might, it might be Rob Delaney.</v>

66
00:04:36.211 --> 00:04:39.930
I mean that guy's been killed for a long time, but, man.

67
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.170
Like the F the fact that he's going so hard in the paint from

68
00:04:46.171 --> 00:04:49.080
this thing, the guy from BTS, I hope he's seen it. He's probably like, Oh.

69
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.760
I mean, he looks like a video game. Look at here. Here's another one.

70
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.820
If you watch closely, it looks like he's definitely about to bite that salami.

71
00:04:56.821 --> 00:04:59.820
But at the last minute he stops and moves the salami away from his face.

72
00:04:59.821 --> 00:05:02.640
The question is, was this planned in advance or was it done spot?

73
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.043
<v 1>Oh.</v>

74
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.653
<v 0>Oh.</v>

75
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.890
The one that I laughed so hard at was the one I think I retweeted it.

76
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.303
<v 1>Oh man.</v>

77
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.200
<v 0>Oh, how do I get to my own Twitter? Sadad um,</v>

78
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.340
I wrote, I wrote, this is the funniest guy than tweet. I've written five years.

79
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.760
Oh, this one was my favorite one for sure. The number seven,

80
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.410
the director is like the director is like salami biting scene.

81
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.930
Take one. Action. Wait, cut, cut. Cut.

82
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.070
Don't bite that salami and the dude and the dude is like, as you wish.

83
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.143
<v 1>Oh.</v>

84
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.750
<v 0>The, as you wish, really put me over the top, man. What?</v>

85
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.050
I don't, I, I legit. I, when I first saw this,

86
00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:04.400
this is how I learned who BTS was,

87
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:08.690
by the way I thought I legit thought that this was a video game.

88
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.290
Why are they being video games? I want to be a video game.

89
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.430
You might want to talk to the stork.

90
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.730
They need to make a song called. You might want to talk to this stork.

91
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.480
Let's listen, let's watch a YouTube video of them, but I can't. But,

92
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.750
but I will though, but I don't want to get demonetized, but I will though.

93
00:06:34.751 --> 00:06:35.590
I know for a little bit

94
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.720
what BTS,

95
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.920
you might want to talk to this stork.

96
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.513
<v 1>Here we go. I'm just gonna</v>

97
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.933
[inaudible]

98
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.460
wow. Game show. Uh,

99
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.640
that's a song or a theme song.

100
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.760
Hey, here we are welcomed back to, you might want to talk to the store.

101
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.020
We've got a stork here.

102
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.840
You'll get to chat to talk to the store to get the chest all the

103
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.500
time. Here's the question. Are these people video games? Um,

104
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:32.320
I would say yes. Oh, let's check with a stark rock. Yup.

105
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:33.460
They're video games.

106
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.650
You might want to talk to the store with your host. I mean to say Nick.

107
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.720
<v 0>With your host. Um,</v>

108
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:52.390
wow dude. That's so annoying. Oh God. They're so annoying.

109
00:07:52.391 --> 00:07:55.630
Those automatic things. When you, when you, when you call someone,

110
00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:00.370
I'm trying to help just have a

111
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:05.620
person until you until it's indistinguishable. Hmm. I didn't quite get that.

112
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:11.560
Hmm. I didn't quite, I didn't quite understand you.

113
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.610
Hmm. Hey, there is no reason for a robot to go.

114
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.280
<v 1>Hmm. We.</v>

115
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.110
<v 0>All know we're talking to a robot.</v>

116
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:23.710
So just get right to the sentence.

117
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.840
<v 1>Hmm. I didn't.</v>

118
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.380
<v 0>Quite get that. Why is the robot stuttering?</v>

119
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.710
Why did you program the robot to starter?

120
00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:35.440
<v 1>Hmm, I.</v>

121
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.950
<v 0>Didn't quite get that. You might want to talk to the stork.</v>

122
00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.200
All I know is the stork was acting strange.

123
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.590
All I know is the troglodyte was acting strange.

124
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:50.440
Uh,
