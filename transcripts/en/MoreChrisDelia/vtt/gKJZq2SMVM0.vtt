00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.480
<v 0>Bro, you know, this app cameo</v>

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.200
that where you can like be on cameo and you can record personal messages for

3
00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:14.070
people who are fans of yours. I got on cameo every, anytime there's a new app.

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.010
I get on it because I feel like I should be on the new.

5
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.560
Never know what's going to become the next Instagram, whatever.

6
00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:21.210
And also like doing social media.

7
00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:24.060
And I never know if I'm going to like it until I already use it for a bunch.

8
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.720
So I got the app cameo and these dude,

9
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.170
I got cameo and I put it on for a thousand dollars.

10
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.140
Cause I saw the people doing them for like 50 bucks a dude. Here's the deal.

11
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.600
Okay. I'm not,

12
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.220
I'm not recording personal messages for people for like $30 a pop did.

13
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:46.160
I'm not going out there. Hey, Jason heard it was your birthday. Hey crystal,

14
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.690
Leah here. Live it up now and send it to them. Like,

15
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.980
and then you get that for 30. It's not worth it to me. Okay. Be a fan. Cool.

16
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.930
Not recording personal messages all day to make $700. You know what I'm saying?

17
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.770
It's just not my bag also. So I put it up. I was like,

18
00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:06.080
what's the most I could charge a thousand bucks.

19
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.990
No way I'm doing it for less than a thousand bucks. No way.

20
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.840
So couldn't do it for more. Cause Cambia wouldn't let you,

21
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.620
I wouldn't do it for 50 grand. You're out of your mind, dude.

22
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.990
I want to be the most it's expensive guy on cameo. Don't give a. Okay. I, I,

23
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.590
I uh, so I did it got a few requests,

24
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.070
actually got like seven requests for a cameo person.

25
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.720
I'm I brought them on to make seven grand off this. So all of a sudden I'm like,

26
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.920
all right, maybe I'll do it. Even though I don't want it did one. Okay.

27
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.590
Two things happen felt cheapest. Cause I was like, eh,

28
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.770
you can't, what am I going to do? Like 90 of these.

29
00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:48.980
And they're gonna be all over the internet. Like, Hey Alyssa,

30
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.110
hope your bar mitzvah was bar mitzvah. What do you call them for chicks?

31
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.460
But mid-scale pick one, you know,

32
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.550
pick your hope. Your mitzvah was good.

33
00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:05.420
I'm calling him on mitzvahs from now on hope. Hope your mitzvah was good.

34
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.630
And then, and then that's it. And I'm not going to do,

35
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.990
I'm going to do seven of these. No. So then I was like, all right,

36
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.190
I might not do it again.

37
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.330
Then I found out cameo takes 25%,

38
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.910
bro. Our little cameo, respect your hustle,

39
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.150
but also you, Oh, you want to take that much money from me?

40
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.250
So I didn't do another one. Okay. Not doing another one.

41
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.060
Unless I can charge out the anus. You understand me, dude?

42
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.150
I'm not, I'm not doing it, dude. It's too. You gotta draw the line somewhere.

43
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.860
W Hey, new app, new app,

44
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.370
give your phone number to fans for 50 bucks.

45
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.700
They can call you whenever they want. No, I'm out of your mind, dude.

46
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.570
Um, so I,

47
00:03:06.571 --> 00:03:10.650
you know, so they took 25% of the and I'm like, all right,

48
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.250
so I'm never doing it again, dude. I swear to God. They,

49
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.130
the people on cameo, they email me, they text me, they do all the. They're like,

50
00:03:20.131 --> 00:03:24.330
Hey, you got booked again. I don't give a. Okay. I respect your hustle.

51
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.060
All good. Do what you gotta do because

52
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.600
I get it. But no, dude, I'm not doing it.

53
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.700
All right. I'll make money other ways.

54
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.480
So they got me on their website.

55
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.770
Like you can get a cameo for me. You can't alright.

56
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.450
I didn't know that they put me on their website either. I didn't know that, bro.

57
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.430
It, you could put me on the. If I can charge 50 K for a shout out, I can.

58
00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.920
My point is, look at it. We'll look at these people, charging this for it.

59
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.440
Look at this. Look at this, uh, truck with Del what's he charged for this thing?

61
00:04:09.151 --> 00:04:11.070
I don't know if he's got money in like real estate or some.

62
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.340
His fighting career is probably, you know,

63
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.250
he's probably not fighting too much anymore. I get it.

64
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.690
He's I'm sure he's made millions of dollars. I think. Scroll up Lance bass way.

65
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.060

 real $50 million just stepping into Europe. He just steps onto European land and makes $50 million. Okay, this 

91
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.450
guy's charging one $125 for a person

92
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.450
. You know what? How about this? No, no. Now I'm not only, I'm not on cameo anymore. For that. I'm buying a personalized message to 

93
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.450
Neil from Neo

94
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.450
. That's what I'm doing right now. After this podcast, I am purchasing a personalized message from 

95
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.450
Neo. I'm going to give him $125 because

96
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.450
 I want him to be like, yo, what's up Chris? D'Elia Hey, how are

97
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.450
 you doing this? Neo? Even though this dude makes $50 million, as soon as the Learjet door opens in Sweden, 

98
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.450
as soon as that opens, a guy shows up with a briefcase and goes here's 50 mil

99
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.450
cash and Neo moonwalks backwards into the plane and goes back. Let me

100
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.283
 need to perform. I'm going to buy a shout out from Neo on cameo, straight up.

101
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.450
So hopefully we'll have it by next week.

102
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.520
Why am I not doing this by? Why am I not buying all these?

103
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.200
By the way I'm buying all these.

104
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.440
Why have I not thought of this? It's unbelievable. I haven't thought of this.
