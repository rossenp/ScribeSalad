00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.990
<v 0>How about, did you guys see the, uh.</v>

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:07.710
<v 1>[Inaudible] the basketball.</v>

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.320
<v 0>Player? What's his name? Who did the laugh? The meme.</v>

4
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.690
<v 1>Uh huh. Uh huh.</v>

5
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.870
<v 0>Car. We Leonard, by the way, I didn't know.</v>

6
00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:23.060
Here's how much a personality matters in basketball.

7
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.960
I didn't know who he was and apparently he's a superstar player,

8
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.550
but like guys like LeBron, you know, and, and,

9
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.180
and even other guys, Steph Curry, they developed a personality. What's his name?

10
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.343
Kiwi. What

11
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.820
car we Leonard

12
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.970
Kauai, Hawaii. The V.

13
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.810
I'm going to play this Hawaii Leonard laugh.

14
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.420
I'm going to play this laugh for you if you don't know about it,

15
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.650
but Jesus Christ.

16
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.170
<v 1>Hey.</v>

17
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.120
<v 0>It sounds like the most insecure JZ of all time.</v>

18
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.340
<v 2>For yourself. And what would you like people to know about you? Here we go.</v>

19
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.200
Listen. I'm a fun guy.

20
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.620
Obviously. I love the game of basketball. I'm a fun guy. Um, I mean,

21
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.290
it's just more question you have to ask me, um,

22
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.120
in order for me to tell you about myself, look.

23
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.430
<v 0>Let me tell you something. First of all, before we get into the insecure laugh,</v>

24
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.180
this guy plays basketball. I respect this guy. He doesn't give a about the.

25
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.920
He doesn't have necessarily an outgoing, crazy superstar personality,

26
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.930
but whatever he doesn't need to. He's all about the basketball.

27
00:01:33.931 --> 00:01:37.020
Apparently is one of the best in the game props to this guy,

28
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.180
props this guy also for doing this, they were probably like,

29
00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:40.410
get out there and do the thing they were like,

30
00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:43.170
what do you want people to know about you? And he says, I'm a fun guy.

31
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.760
I'm a fun guy. Every note is the same.

32
00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:51.930
If you're talking and every note is the same dude talking his musical,

33
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.230
you know what I mean? When I'm talking, I go up. I say, oh, this kind of.

34
00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.540
And I then go back down and say, Hey man, whatever comes out of it.

35
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.460
No, I don't really, all I'm doing is 7,000. Yeah. Right?

36
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.100
You learn how to say certain stuff as a comedian.

37
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:09.900
You think about that all the time. You go there,

38
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.370
you talk about this mana and then Baja, everyone laughs. This guy is just like,

39
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.050
I'm a fun guy. Of course, it's not going to work.

40
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.380
You're not going to get people on your side. Personality wise.

41
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.650
Now here is the rest of the.

42
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.360
<v 2>I just can't give you a whole spiel. How am I going to, um,</v>

43
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.650
in order for me to tell you about myself, I just can't give you a whole spiel.

44
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.210
<v 0>Oh. In order for me to tell you about myself,</v>

45
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.550
I just can give you the full spiel.

46
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.360
Unless you asked specific questions.

47
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.480
I don't even know where you sitting at.

48
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.740
<v 2>Oh, um, I mean,</v>

49
00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.410
it's just more question you have to ask me, um,

50
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.700
in order for me to tell you about myself, I just can't give you a whole spiel.

51
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.850
I don't even know where you sitting at.

52
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:12.503
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

53
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.970
<v 0>In order where you sit in there. I just,</v>

54
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.250
I don't even know where you sit sitting at. That was the best part.

55
00:03:20.251 --> 00:03:24.450
That was the part where you realize, oh, lash my hands of this.

56
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.820
Do you know what I mean? He was just like, you know,

57
00:03:26.821 --> 00:03:29.670
in order to tell you what I'm like, you got to get more specific.

58
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.590
I just can't give you a full spill. I don't even know where you sitting at.

59
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.213
Whoa,

60
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.210
Hey man, you're a robot.

61
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.480
Let's just do that whole thing again. How robotic it is.

62
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.610
How crazy is it to have a personality?

63
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.440
But that's what they said about Steph Curry in the beginning.

64
00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:51.880
And that dude lit it up.

65
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.660
<v 2>Yourself. And what would you like people to know about you? Um,</v>

66
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.890
first of all, speaking to the mic, I'm a fun guy. Um,

67
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.200
obviously I love the game of basketball. Um, I mean,

68
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.870
there's just more question you have to ask. Um,

69
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.100
in order for me to tell you about myself, I just can't give you a whole spiel.

70
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.280
I don't even know where you sitting at.

71
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.923
I mean, dude.

72
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.440
<v 0>You got to see the video too. You got to see his mouth, dude. It's weird as.</v>

73
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:29.820
It looks like a Simpson.

74
00:04:29.821 --> 00:04:33.540
All of a sudden he looks like what he looks like when that guy at, at the drunk,

75
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.960
in the Simpsons burps that when it goes, blah, blah, blah, and all the,

76
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.230
oh,

77
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.280
sick here. Hey man.

78
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.490
Easy. Just say, ah, man, you know what?

79
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.790
You know what it is to this guy's probably, I mean, he's how old is he? Like 24.

80
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.450
Maybe. That's the thing, man. When I was 22, I remember being at,

81
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.220
before I did stand up and before I became a thick skinned individual

82
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.450
because of bombing for so much, like I construction in the house. Sorry,

83
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.070
if you hear it, whatever disrespectful. But um, the, uh,

84
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.280
he's 27 years old when I was 22,

85
00:05:17.281 --> 00:05:21.630
I remember I broke up with a girl, a girl broke up with me, broken my heart.

86
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.830
And then I was like, you know what? I am going to go out. I'm going to go.

87
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.100
My buddy was like, come on, come out. Let's go. Let's go hang out.

88
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.350
We'll we'll go get you. We can talk to some chicks. You know, we'll get you out,

89
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.780
it'll be good. And I'm like, all right, I don't really like going out.

90
00:05:33.781 --> 00:05:36.360
But I go out to this bar, went out to this bar called nix and Beverly Hills.

91
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.400
And it was a party that he knew everybody there.

92
00:05:38.401 --> 00:05:40.620
And I didn't know anybody there. And there was this really cute girl there.

93
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.560
And I thought she looked like Brittany Spears.

94
00:05:43.561 --> 00:05:46.290
And this is back when Brittany Spears was like the hottest, you know, the, the,

95
00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:50.730
the number one to me, the archetype of like, oh my God, the hottest chick ever.

96
00:05:50.731 --> 00:05:54.300
So, uh, so I was like, she was in our conversation. I was like,

97
00:05:54.301 --> 00:05:58.280
what do I say to this girl in my head? I was like, what I do? How do I talk?

98
00:05:58.281 --> 00:06:00.590
And then I would say things. And every time I said something, I was like,

99
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.200
how come these words are coming out of my mouth?

100
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.770
I don't want to sound like this. But every single time she said something,

101
00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:08.870
she'd be like, cool. Well, what else did this and that? And I'd be like,

102
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:10.030
basically, uh,

103
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.880
it's weird. I was 22. Then I got on stage,

104
00:06:16.881 --> 00:06:20.390
started bombing a lot and then didn't give a about anything.

105
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.340
<v 1>Oh, ho ho.</v>

106
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.210
<v 0>That laugh literally sounds more like busting a nut than laughing.</v>

107
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.660
It actually does unbelievable.

108
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.700
<v 2>The whole spiel. I don't even know where you sitting at.</v>

109
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.220
<v 0>I want to hang out with that guy and make him laugh all day long. Oh.</v>

110
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.490
<v 1>Ha ha ha. So funny.</v>
