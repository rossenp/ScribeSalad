WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.110
<v 0>So here we go. Dude, my opener, when we were in a,</v>

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.970
I don't even know where the we were. How about that? How about where I,

3
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.540
how about, I never know where the I am, dude. Um,

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.310
so I was in, um, somewhere, got to the airport.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.180
Oh, this was in Cincinnati, which by the way, the airport,

6
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.490
Cincinnati is in Kentucky. Right? Hey,

7
00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:29.660
go yourself, man. Put it in the actual city. So confusing when you land.

8
00:00:29.661 --> 00:00:33.830
You're like I'm in Kentucky. Oh, I flew to the wrong place,

9
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.300
I guess the right next to each other. But anyway, uh,

10
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.050
look at this Cincinnati Northern and Northern Kentucky international airport

11
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.080
pick one. So I get to,

12
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.440
I get to the place, uh,

13
00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:52.220
to fly back out to beautiful sunny Los Angeles, California.

14
00:00:52.221 --> 00:00:54.020
That's been raining so much.

15
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.420
And I notice in the airport on the carpet of the

16
00:00:59.421 --> 00:01:03.500
airport with planes on it, carpets and airports. We have planes on it.

17
00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:06.350
Like they think that that's like a cute thing. Like get out, get outta here,

18
00:01:06.351 --> 00:01:11.120
dude. This is not a boat tickets to make it, make it drab is.

19
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.440
It's an airport. Don't try to cheer me up in an airport. I'm in an airport.

20
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.540
I want to be. Let me be,

21
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.550
let me feel like there's people with like diseases around because it should

22
00:01:22.551 --> 00:01:26.720
be, uh, that fluorescent lighting white walls.

23
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.570
And don't make it cute because it make it drab as.

24
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.800
So I get to the airport and um,

25
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.870
I noticed I looked down and there's straight up tracked

26
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.330
all over the floor of the airport now. Yeah. Welcome to Cincinnati.

27
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.680
However, there's tracked all over the air, all over the,

28
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.220
all over. And I'm like, Ooh.

29
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.380
And as I'm looking at this track,

30
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.750
I noticed my opener checking the bottom of his shoes,

31
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.360
which only means one thing he's stepped in it.

32
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.770
And what's only means another thing. I'm thrilled. Okay.

33
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.600
So as he's looking, I noticed, I was like, Oh, it's, I'm laughing.

34
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.860
And he's like, did I, what the? He's mumbling as you do anyone who steps in.

35
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.580
The one thing that you're doing is looking at the bottom of your shoe.

36
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.220
And the other thing you're doing is not saying words.

37
00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:26.390
You're literally just going this, what the? Right?

38
00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:31.340
So he's doing that. Okay. Now I'm not laughing yet. No.

39
00:02:31.341 --> 00:02:34.670
The reason why I'm not laughing yet is because it's

40
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.160
Oh, dark 30. It's way too early.

41
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.560
The flight was so early because I needed to get on the one that

42
00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:50.150
connected to that. Didn't connect to Los Angeles. For some reason,

43
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.050
if you want a straight shot in the Midwest to lax,

44
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.730
you've got to wake up at Oh, dark 30.

45
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.063
All right.

46
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.470
<v 1>If you don't wake up at Oh, dark 30. Guess what?</v>

47
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.260
<v 0>Connecting like a plebeian. Okay. Now I don't want to connect.</v>

48
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.280
You can get a noon flight. Congratulations. But guess what?

49
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.250
You've got to connect in Dallas. You got to connect it in Atlanta.

50
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.870
Now that's what we call out of the way.

51
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.360
I've decided to only connect now. Cause these early flights, man.

52
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.820
So you got to fly out. When you, if you don't connect,

53
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.850
you want a straight shot to lax. You gotta, you gotta fly out.

54
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.250
<v 1>Literally the.</v>

55
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.230
<v 0>Same time that they killed bin Ladin, whatever time that was. You gotta,</v>

56
00:03:40.231 --> 00:03:45.000
you gotta do it so early there's with night vision goggles on

57
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.320
at the airport. It sucked.

58
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.440
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

59
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.860
<v 0>So he's checking his going. I'm on something.</v>

60
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.420
I'm not coming home with all the bags and I'm like, it. I don't give a.

61
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.750
I'm just going to keep moving because I can't laugh yet because it's old,

62
00:04:00.751 --> 00:04:03.600
dark 30. Okay. It's the time that they killed bin Laden.

63
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.353
So

64
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.740
we get to the thing now I got clear.

65
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.990
I got clear my opener. He doesn't have clear.

66
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.770
You hear me now granted Cincinnati airport.

67
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.590
I don't even know if they have clear and I don't remember, but if they do it,

68
00:04:22.591 --> 00:04:25.350
doesn't matter because nobody's going to the Cincinnati airport because you

69
00:04:25.351 --> 00:04:26.184
don't need to use the clear.

70
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.370
You don't even do it to get a pre you just get there. And it's like, yeah,

71
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.690
come on in. You're the only guy. So I,

72
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.130
I, we get through the TSA and he's like.

73
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.770
<v 1>He's a good dude. I step in.</v>

74
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.970
<v 0>And I'm like, Oh bro, you did, man.</v>

75
00:04:47.971 --> 00:04:50.670
I noticed it was in the airport.

76
00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.490
<v 1>And he's like, what?</v>

77
00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.850
<v 0>And I'm like, w w it was actually inside.</v>

78
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.600
And I noticed while it was happening, I, I, it was on the floor. I,

79
00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:09.480
I noticed it while you were already thought, saw it and saw it on the bottom.

80
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.433
Yeah.

81
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.170
<v 1>And he says, are you kidding me?</v>

82
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.850
<v 0>And I was like, uh, nah, it was inside. He was inside.</v>

83
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.650
<v 1>Inside the, inside the airport. And I'm like, yeah. He's like,</v>

84
00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:29.040
are you kidding me, dude? It's 4:00 AM.

85
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.110
<v 0>And I, and he, he, by the way, he had on like,</v>

86
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.170
kind of like new Jordans that were like kind. So we, I was like, actually like,

87
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.960
dude, like they're kind of dope. Like I should maybe get them.

88
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.660
So he had on Jordans that I liked. And by the way,

89
00:05:39.661 --> 00:05:43.440
the only reason why he gets Jordans is because I've convinced him that they're

90
00:05:43.441 --> 00:05:47.160
cool. And now he's like doing it because he's like, Oh yeah,

91
00:05:47.161 --> 00:05:50.790
this is the shoes to get. He freely admits it because like, I don't know,

92
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.040
fashion. I got to get the cruiser. So he's got the nice Jordans.

93
00:05:53.041 --> 00:05:56.910
I stepped in the and then it past TSA was like, so I was like, it.

94
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.510
I can't, it smells like, man. And I was like, he's like,

95
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.490
how the does Cincinnati have in the airport? He's like, this place.

96
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.210
So we're getting a lot. We're getting in line at Starbucks, which is like,

97
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.500
the airport always has the one. They always have the sucker Starbucks.

98
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.480
They always have the sucker Starbucks.

99
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.850
And then they have the actual Starbucks that you should go to.

100
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.380
Cause no one's going now like a up because it's so dark 30. I get past the TSA.

101
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.300
I see the sucker Starbucks. Now,

102
00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:31.220
the reason why it's the sucker Starbucks is because the line is longer than the

103
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:33.410
line in Russia for bread in 1980. You know?

104
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.690
So I'm in this long line waiting and I'm not

105
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:41.540
even thinking I'm just on autopilot. And he's like, dude,

106
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.450
I got to go wash your off the bottom of my shoes. Like, no, dude,

107
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.290
I pay you to hang out with me. Stay in this long line with me. He was like,

108
00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:52.430
dude, I, you know what? You gotta be crazy.

109
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:57.290
And he disobeyed me and I respect him for that. You understand me?

110
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.480
I respect him for that because he's passionate about getting this

111
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:03.980
off the bottom of his shoes.

112
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.330
So I start laughing hard and he starts walking to the bathroom.

113
00:07:08.331 --> 00:07:11.570
Now the bathroom is so far away. Now he passed, he passed,

114
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.350
he passed passes, almost had a stroke right there.

115
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.970
He passes the non sucker Starbucks where there's nobody.

116
00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:21.200
There you go. There.

117
00:07:21.201 --> 00:07:24.020
It's like a open field because everyone's at the sucker Starbucks.

118
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.930
Cause it's the first Starbucks. Now I'm waiting in line.

119
00:07:26.931 --> 00:07:28.820
I don't know that there's Starbucks over there. I'm going to thinking about it.

120
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.260
But he watches the. I get through the whole line.

121
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.730
It's like you walk through the carwash because it took so long.

122
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:41.440
I ordered the iced Americanos because that's what you get at. Oh,

123
00:07:41.441 --> 00:07:46.150
dark 30. And we,

124
00:07:46.151 --> 00:07:48.880
and I guess what I do, I splurge, man.

125
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.410
I'm trying to work on my trunk. I'm trying to shred down my trunk,

126
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.760
but not at Oh, dark 30 dude. You got to take some liberties, man. Guess what?

127
00:07:57.761 --> 00:08:01.540
I got a cinnamon bagel with two cream, cheeses got two of them, one for me,

128
00:08:01.541 --> 00:08:06.010
one for my opener. And I mean because he's got and I, because he's at stage,

129
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.400
he's great on stage, but he's actually technically.

130
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:14.410
So I get them that and he, I get, they say,

131
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.920
you know, cinnamon bagel, they got my ice Americano. I'm eating the.

132
00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.100
He comes back and he sits down in a half and he's like, dude,

133
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:27.250
it's like, I can't get it off, man. I'm a, no matter what I do, it's like,

134
00:08:27.251 --> 00:08:31.150
I have under my nose, man. It's like a Kia. Stop smelling it.

135
00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:36.580
And I'm laughing, crying is so much funnier when you're tired.

136
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:40.180
is so much funnier. And I'll tell you this much,

137
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.230
I'm better on stage when I'm tired because I'm loosey goosey all about having

138
00:08:44.231 --> 00:08:46.240
that silly goose moment. Dude,

139
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:50.410
you think I'm sitting down for a silly goose time and that's it when I'm tired

140
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:55.360
and I got bags,

141
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.350
my eyes, dude,

142
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.160
it is silly goose exponential.

143
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.670
It is silly goose with that two on the side of,

144
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.990
on the upper side of it because we're doing, whatever that math is,

145
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.630
math. You know, anything but basic math you got in into other, man.

146
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.910
But there's a whole nother story. That's another podcast another day.

147
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.330
So he is so and I get my cinnamon bagel,

148
00:09:24.331 --> 00:09:25.080
by the way,

149
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.050
for some reason only one of the cinnamon bagels was ready and I'm eating this.

150
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.020
And he was like, where's the mine dude. And I'm like, I don't know, man,

151
00:09:31.021 --> 00:09:33.010
you got to ask for it. I guess they didn't bring it out. And he's like.

152
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:38.250
So it gets up and does it. And he eats it dude.

153
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.910
And he's miserable eating it, but it was so good that he says,

154
00:09:41.911 --> 00:09:43.080
he goes like this. He says,

155
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.180
This is such a, you had to be there moment. I don't give a.

156
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.480
I'm still telling you. Cause that's how we get here. Do it.

157
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:57.290
I'm disrespected on you mother. My whole, I want my holster.

158
00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.480
That's my dream dude, to get my whole standup to just be a,

159
00:09:59.481 --> 00:10:04.310
you had to be there moment. I want my whole audience in the audience to be like,

160
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:09.050
I guess that's my goal, dude. They're like it doesn't I,

161
00:10:09.051 --> 00:10:13.730
it seems like you had to be there. I want no one laughing,

162
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.480
just straight up audience members being like, sounds like you.

163
00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:18.483
<v 1>The booth.</v>

164
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:23.720
<v 0>So he gets the cinema and he's all huffing and puffing, eating the thing,</v>

165
00:10:23.721 --> 00:10:25.220
smelling under his nose, right?

166
00:10:25.221 --> 00:10:30.200
Like he's got a stash and Andy and he's eating this bagel and he's

167
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.153
just.

168
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:37.040
<v 1>Man, it's like a donut.</v>

169
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:41.300
<v 0>And we just didn't</v>

170
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:45.650
stop laughing for 11

171
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.760
minutes.

172
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.230
It hit us good dude.

173
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:55.790
The Cupid of funniness just took that at bow and arrow and

174
00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.520
rocket it through the back right through our hearts. And we just started crying,

175
00:11:01.521 --> 00:11:05.150
laughing immediately because we were eating a doughnut dude.

176
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:10.190
these bagels that get creative. That is a donut bro.

177
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:14.600
Cinnamon raisin bagels. Get a donut.

178
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:19.730
I realized I up. I should've just got the donut dude.

179
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:24.560
Cinnamon raisin bagel. Hey,

180
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:28.340
don't call that a bagel. You fat.

181
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:34.910
That's a donut. Oh, it was,

182
00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.180
you know what? It was better than a donut dude.

183
00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:43.280
If have you had a cinnamon raisin bagel with two

184
00:11:43.281 --> 00:11:46.730
cream cheeses, Peggy at,

185
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.950
at dark 30.

186
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.670
<v 1>Hey, that's it.</v>

187
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:58.810
<v 0>My hands are tied now. That's it dude. You know what? Actually,</v>

188
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:04.510
I'll tell you. I'll tell you this right now. If you've had a cinnamon bagel,

189
00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:08.620
uh, at, at, at, Oh, dark 30 with two cream cheeses.

190
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:14.500
that dude. That's what you're that's what's going on in your head right there.

191
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.200
When you take that bite and you go like this and this is the bike.

192
00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:27.270
When you go like this and you're going like this and you go like this, huh?

193
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:28.583
Can you spread it?

194
00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:37.403
<v 1>Dude.</v>

195
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.770
<v 0>Spreading the bagel, leading the bagel, putting under Oh wow.</v>

196
00:12:40.771 --> 00:12:44.160
They toasted a nice, just right. Not too much.

197
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:47.933
[inaudible].

198
00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.170
<v 1>And then you're just,</v>

199
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:57.060
you're good for the rest of the day, my babies.

200
00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:02.430
<v 0>Or if you have on the bottom of your Jordans that balanced it, the out,</v>

201
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.790
it that's about bed. So life's about, it's about balance. Life's about balance.

202
00:13:05.791 --> 00:13:07.680
You step in some, you get a cinnamon bagel, you know,

203
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:13.110
the most Italian thing to say, Hey, you know, you step in some. You gotta,

204
00:13:13.111 --> 00:13:16.770
you know, you love you. You balance it out with a cinnamon bagel, right? Yeah.

205
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.480
Hey, you're a doughnut, but you know,
