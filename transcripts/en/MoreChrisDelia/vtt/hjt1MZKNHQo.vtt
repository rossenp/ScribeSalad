1
00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:04.950
<v 0>Gotta go back to Albuquerque. I know Albuquerque,</v>

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.940
I think on Wednesday or some, dude,

3
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:13.920
I was in Albuquerque for two days and I w I was there. I flew in,

4
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.050
I had a whole day there. I did my, my, the meetings that I had to do.

5
00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:22.740
And then I was done at like two or three and the rest of the day, I was like,

6
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:24.090
all right, cool. I worked out a little bit,

7
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.620
keep my back all mountainous. You know what I mean?

8
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.540
I did some chin-ups just to make sure the lats kept like a turtle shell.

9
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.640
I did some chest exercise to make sure that, you know what I mean?

10
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.200
I keep my Sikh cup and I did shoulders exercise, of course,

11
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:46.320
because I want to keep the documentary, I want to keep the documentarian happy.

12
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.350
Cause they're probably doing a documentary on my shoulders or some. So, uh,

13
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.260
I was in Albuquerque. And let me tell you something, man.

14
00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.090
It was for one day and I was leaving the next day and bully,

15
00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:03.600
is it boring? It's hot as.

16
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.180
I mean 11 o'clock. I landed and I, the day before, and I was like, Hey guys,

17
00:01:09.181 --> 00:01:11.940
is there a place to eat or something? And they were like, no,

18
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.930
they didn't even like, think you were like, there's burger King. And I was like,

19
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.860
Hey, look at me. Do I look like,

20
00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:23.850
I want to do I look like I need fast food right now at 11

21
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.450
look at me. And they were like, yeah, no, I mean, you do keep your back,

22
00:01:30.451 --> 00:01:35.160
like a turtle. You know, it's like a turtle shell. And I saw a documentary crew,

23
00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:36.050
like trying to be sneaky.

24
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.390
They're obviously trying to shoot your shoulders and we get it.

25
00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:44.280
You should be wearing a bra. So I don't know. So I'm just, I,

26
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.430
so I went to a place in downtown Albuquerque

27
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.030
and I walked in, Oh, by the way, I was like, is there any, I was like, Oh,

28
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:56.700
I found a place on Yelp. I was like, it's open. And I went to the lobby,

29
00:01:56.701 --> 00:01:58.620
the people at the lobby. And I was like, Hey guys.

30
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:02.400
So I found a place that's open. I was like, I just, you know, I, I guess,

31
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.400
cause I don't know the area is this area safe to go here? And they were like,

32
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.860
Oh yeah, it's fine. Of course it's totally safe. And I was like, okay, cool.

33
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.980
Got in the Uber. And then the Uber driver, no. He was like,

34
00:02:12.981 --> 00:02:15.860
are you Krista? Leah? And I was like, yup. And he's like, Oh cool. No way.

35
00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:17.720
I was like, Oh yeah. He's like, why are you on this place? I was like, Oh,

36
00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:20.090
I was the only place open to eat. And he was like, Oh yeah,

37
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.780
there was someone shot seven people next door a

38
00:02:24.781 --> 00:02:28.100
week ago. Hey,

39
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.750
that's safe. What's dangerous.

40
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.100
What was there a zombie? Yeah. Well there haven't been zombie attacks.

41
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.720
No, there hasn't been a zombie attack there. So yeah. Oh dude.

42
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.230
Seven people got shot. Ah,

43
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.270
that's the definition of danger. And I went there and I was like, really?

44
00:02:53.271 --> 00:02:55.340
And he goes like, yeah. He's like, yeah. He's like, I know.

45
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.430
Cause I'm a crime scene investigator though. Uber driver said.

46
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.660
<v 1>Well, I'm checked out.</v>

47
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.300
<v 0>Hey, to know what a guy driving you in.</v>

48
00:03:09.301 --> 00:03:12.900
Your Uber says, just so you know,

49
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.580
just so you know, just so you know, it could be the truest.

50
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.310
It could be truer than the sky is blue. Or I live in a house. Okay.

51
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.620
When an Uber driver says, whether it's true or not.

52
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.940
Cause you know, in the daytime, I'm a crime scene investigator.

53
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.130
You're just lying because I, huh.

54
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.460
Imagine what's his name? David Caruso in that show,

55
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.370
whatever the he is, where he puts his CSI,

56
00:03:47.371 --> 00:03:52.200
where he puts his glasses on and then walks away like the illest alive do

57
00:03:52.201 --> 00:03:56.700
David Caruso. Wow. You know, something's definitely true about David cruzo.

58
00:03:56.701 --> 00:04:01.380
He never got his kicked that's you can tell that about David Caruso so much

59
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.650
just by the way he acts. Because if you got your handed to you,

60
00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:06.810
you would never act that bad as that guy acts.

61
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.370
So bad-ass he acts like nobody ever ever said no,

62
00:04:11.371 --> 00:04:15.180
or me up. I'm on the that guy.

63
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.210
And I'm not saying this cause of any like ill,

64
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.230
you know, opinion I have of him or anything.

65
00:04:22.231 --> 00:04:26.730
But that guy technically needs his beat because you can't act like that.

66
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.870
But he acts like that. And he just, uh, he, you know, I mean some of the,

67
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.640
just look at some of this,

68
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.570
but imagine this imagine you're a crime scene investigator and then Uber by

69
00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:40.404
night,

70
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.200
CSI David Caruso one-liners there we go. First when it comes up,

71
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.640
obviously because they're ridiculous. Horatio canes.

72
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.120
The fact that his name is Horacio came, you know,

73
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.600
sunglasses moments, just listening.

74
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.590
<v 1>You got to drive by drive by Miami style.</v>

75
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.570
<v 0>And then, and then he puts his glasses on every time dude. It's so hilarious.</v>

76
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.130
<v 1>Question becomes. And Alex was the mob sent to draws to the crime scene</v>

77
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:16.600
or sent to destroy.

78
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.150
[inaudible] always.

79
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.140
<v 0>The beginning of the show, dude.</v>

80
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.480
<v 1>Both of these stories get up and run away. You do.</v>

81
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.790
You've got something to hide.

82
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.550
[inaudible] listen. Um, I don't want you to worry about it. Alright,

83
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.530
Mr. Coleman, because I I'll be a memory.

84
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.300
<v 0>Never got his kicked. Never does so many. You know what he does?</v>

85
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.850
He he's a wow for sure.

86
00:05:56.851 --> 00:06:00.320
David thinks he's a black belt in karate because he practiced all himself and

87
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:02.450
never got instructed on karate at all. He just did it,

88
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.520
worked on it in his room and he's like, I'm a blogger.

89
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.550
And he would tell somebody I'm a black belt. And it's because he thinks that he,

90
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.170
he, uh, did karate every day. And he's like, I've worked on it.

91
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.830
I'm a black belt too. He says to like jujitsu guys.

92
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.370
<v 1>Maybe he took off or maybe you got taken for a ride.</v>

93
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.600
<v 0>Bad. You know the writer, what?</v>

94
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.610
The writers wrote every script with only a shirt on no pants on

95
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.250
and their out on the chair and they never cleaned the chair.

96
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.110
And they other people use the chair and they didn't give a.

97
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.980
<v 1>She, she came down to drink mojitos and catch some sun,</v>

98
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.660
but it looks like something caught her,

99
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.600
made it up, made it up. That one man.

100
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.910
<v 0>Ended up himself. He tells him to leave it blank.</v>

101
00:06:57.911 --> 00:07:01.810
He tells the writers to leave it blank, leave it blank. And then they go, okay.

102
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.680
He's like, I'll come up with it on the day. And then he himself goes

103
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:08.230
and walks out the room.

104
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.570
<v 1>He died hours before this accident ever happened. So our accident</v>

105
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.900
is not an accident at all.

106
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.550
Oh, dude.

107
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.810
<v 0>Oh, you know, there's somebody on the crew that wants to lay him out.</v>

108
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.380
And he's just, every time they shoot those, he's just like, God. One day,

109
00:07:35.381 --> 00:07:36.214
I'm going to kick his.

110
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.580
<v 1>Here we go. We gotta move quick.</v>

111
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.750
Tide is rising and we have a sinking crime scene.

112
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.360
It's not looking too good on the contrary.

113
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.930
There's a chance this girl is alive. And we

114
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.350
find out that's not even one.

115
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.230
<v 0>The writers were like, let's try and do it. So he can't do it.</v>

116
00:08:11.231 --> 00:08:12.064
And he still did it.

117
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:18.340
I won a bagel at the,

118
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.090
in a restaurant. So. And what will you be having his wife's just like,

119
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.160
I'll just have a cob salad. And what would you like?

120
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.820
I would like the breakfast sandwich.

121
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.260
<v 1>No matter how you cut it, divorce sucks. Think</v>

122
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.073
it's a killer.

123
00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:43.450
Alex. Miami has a new breed of cream.

124
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:47.523
What are you going to do?

125
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:57.090
I'm going to get you the truth. Not even one, dude.

126
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:02.910
<v 0>What is this song? It's the who? Right? What, what is it, dude? Wow.</v>

127
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.620
I mean, that's so funny, dude. I love that. I wanna,

128
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.730
I gotta play that. that dude. I'm Horatio Keynes.

129
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:16.770
I don't give a the who, what? What's the song? Do you know who?

130
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:17.903
Oh yeah, it is.

131
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:20.873
<v 1>Who.</v>

132
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.680
<v 0>You, I think it's that one. Right? But not, that's not. What's called, is it?</v>

133
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.870
Is it? No, it's gotta be one of these. Hold on.

134
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.233
<v 1>That one.</v>

135
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.630
<v 0>All right guys. You know, we get it. They did that song.</v>

136
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.720
It's called. Who are you? Okay. I'm looking, I'm looking. I'm looking baby.

137
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.690
I'm what's that? That's what's called.

138
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:54.613
Won't get.

139
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.340
<v 1>Yeah. That's it. Wow.</v>

140
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:11.840
<v 0>When did they start screaming though?</v>

141
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:21.920
<v 1>After this? After our first.</v>

142
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:29.720
Whenever, yes.

143
00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:34.070
It's time to head back. Yeah. We knew that one coming a mile away.

144
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:38.480
They're trying to get our attention. I don't know. He just got mine.

145
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:47.210
Alex, let, just now that's down to one

146
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.170
or his hauling us

147
00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:59.750
a dead body can have that effect on

148
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.800
a few more words. Already.

149
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:09.050
Verdict is in Frank guilty as charged the jury's out.

150
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:13.850
Oh wow. That was a good one. Good. That was my favorite one. Wow.

151
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:20.090
Well they found more than that. Oh wow. Pretty big.

152
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:25.160
But very cool though. We've got, is that farm status? Either dead or dying.

153
00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:27.320
Oh wow. That one was quick. It was on the moon.

154
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:31.580
He was on a move that one's bad kids are not gonna get away with murder.

155
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.050
Get away with murder.

156
00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.340
<v 0>Dude. My Uber driver doesn't do that.</v>

157
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.570
You know? Imagine you,

158
00:11:44.571 --> 00:11:46.610
I got in and there were other people in the car and I was like, what the?

159
