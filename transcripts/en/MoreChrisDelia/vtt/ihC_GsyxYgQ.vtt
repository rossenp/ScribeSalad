00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.260

3
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.750
<v 1>Dude. This is funny, man. Seaside towns.</v>

4
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.060
High-tech anti-sex toilets or spray users with water. Not going to stop them.

5
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.700
What if you have the one? That's your kink? Oh dude, you're going to get,

6
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.850
Hey, getting sprayed is part of sex.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.340
<v 0>Uh, no, but there's there's I don't know.</v>

9
00:00:39.381 --> 00:00:42.710
loose in porthcawl South Wales all made up.

10
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.940
Where are you from? Loose. Oh, in porthcawl. Yes.

11
00:00:46.941 --> 00:00:51.380
South Wales head made it all up where it will feature weight,

12
00:00:51.381 --> 00:00:55.060
sensors and sound alarms to stop. Anti-social use dude.

13
00:00:55.061 --> 00:00:56.630
This is so weird to me that this is where.

14
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.463
<v 0>We're at.</v>

15
00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.773
<v 1>This is on the guardian,</v>

16
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.700
the Welsh seaside town of porthcawl is planning to install anti-sex public

17
00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:08.420
toilets that would spray occupants with water and sounding an alarm. All right.

18
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:12.980
So look, first of all, how much is going on in these,

19
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.280
in the, in these toilets? Okay. Like, is it just,

20
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.230
is it just all day? Because then okay.

21
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.370
If it's not all day, then just who really cares, you know,

22
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.200
consensual sex in bathrooms.

23
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.933
<v 0>Okay.</v>

24
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.270
<v 1>Violent movement sensors would automatically open the doors.</v>

25
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.270
Oh, I can't.

26
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.100
<v 0>I mean, dude, they want to see it.</v>

27
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.930
<v 1>Violent movement sensors would automatically open the doors and sound high pitch</v>

28
00:01:44.931 --> 00:01:48.410
alarms with fine water jets, soaking the interior.

29
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.430
<v 2>The sexiest thing ever. So all of a sudden you're,</v>

30
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.770

31
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.430
the doors are gonna open and then you're going to get doused with water and

32
00:02:04.431 --> 00:02:08.420
you're going to be wet. ah, sexy yet.

33
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.850
The government has a King. I mean dude.

34
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.520
<v 0>South.</v>

35
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.100
<v 2>Wales. What does that Welsh says sexy.</v>

36
00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:22.430
They're not going to stop him, dude.

37
00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:24.980
I'm running to that thing. I want to.

38
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.710
And you're going to have people watch and spray me with water. K,

39
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.760
that dude. When the goes, boom, and the doors open and I get down with water.

40
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.660
I'm going, ah, I'm amping it up, dude.

41
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.540
I'm amping it up. My babies for real.

42
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.900
You think I won't that dude.

43
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.980
A hundred percent while the goes down

44
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.890
and I'm in there with a dude, the dude and just,

45
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.380
I don't give a dude. Oh, here it comes.

46
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.840
Are you kidding me? Oh no, here it comes.

47
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.540
The water. Oh, what? What's going on over there. I'm Whoa,

48
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.550
what's going on over there. Oh, here we go.

49
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.470
Blast all over whatever their names are

50
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.610
all over Christian.

51
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.900
<v 1>That's the only guy I know. That's well she's Christian Bell.</v>

52
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.230
Real dude. Are you kidding me bro? That's it?

53
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.570
Why can't I move the thing? Can't move it. Great. Yes. Can't move it.

54
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.790
Can't move the soundboard thing. Why is it happening?

55
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.170
Can't move the soundboard thing. It's up there and I can't move it. Technology.

56
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.210
Jude, send it over to want fire babies. Yeah, dude. That's ridiculous.

57
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.590
<v 2>Why would you want to be, I mean, how much.</v>

58
00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.000
<v 1>Is going on in, in, in Welsh land, in Westland?</v>

59
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.870
How much is going on over there in bathrooms?

60
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.140
Here's the other thing do here's the other thing too?

61
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.990
Not here's the other thing too.

62
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.510
So spending so much money on this alarms,

63
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.950
doused with water, weight sensors, bro. You know how much a weight sensor is?

64
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.000
I swear to God, they're a hundred grand. I have that on full authority.

65
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.910
That weight sensors are a hundred grand.

66
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.590
Look at this poor called town. Council is spending, Oh, here we go.

67
00:04:31.591 --> 00:04:34.860
170 Euro thousand dollars or whatever the it is.

68
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.280
That little E with the curvy thing at the top go, you know what I mean?

69
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.770
What is that? That's probably around the same.

70
00:04:40.771 --> 00:04:44.430
I'm a member American in Griffin park.

71
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.400
According to Wells online, the planning documents detail,

72
00:04:47.401 --> 00:04:50.580
a range of security features to deter rough sleeping.

73
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.750
<v 2>You mean sleeping, dude.</v>

74
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.150
Sit. They didn't want to admit it. Oh,

75
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.550
wa sit there and don't want to admit that they're pervy. Yes.

76
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.090
Hello. We are Welsh. We have planning documents to detail.

77
00:05:12.091 --> 00:05:16.710
A range of security features to deter rough sleeping. I swear to God,

78
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.210
Including an audible warning,

79
00:05:21.211 --> 00:05:26.010
combined with the lights and heating being switched off with lights and

80
00:05:26.011 --> 00:05:30.060
heating being switched off. I want it to,

81
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.223
but I'm freezing.

82
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.610
All toilets would be fitted.

83
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.330
All toilets would be fitted with a full.

84
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.570
<v 1>Sure floor and wall washer,</v>

85
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.880
which could be operated after every use Jesus.

86
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.850
<v 2>Christ. You know, so much.</v>

87
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.600
<v 1>This is how you know nothing's wrong and where as well.</v>

88
00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:03.123
<v 0>Whales.</v>

89
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.700
<v 1>That's how you know nothing's wrong in Wells in America where like everyone's</v>

90
00:06:06.701 --> 00:06:10.240
dying and getting shot. And in Wales they're like, ah,

91
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.900
let's put weight sensors in our public restaurants because we don't want people

92
00:06:13.901 --> 00:06:15.430
to be having too good of a time.

93
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.193
<v 0>Uh.</v>

94
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.230
<v 1>I'm moving to Wales dude and in, where is this?</v>

95
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.640
Porthcawl in Griffin park, dude. I'm going there, bro. that.

96
00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.460
That's a red light. What if you went in there and it was all like,

97
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.070
like red lit and. And Leslie's like so nice.

98
00:06:33.071 --> 00:06:35.470
They had paintings on the wall that were like, like, yo,

99
00:06:35.471 --> 00:06:38.920
this is the kind of the they're trying to trap you, dude. They want you to,

100
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.250
but also want money out of it all.

101
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.980
Tell us we'll be fitted with a full high pressure floor and wall washer that

102
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.580
could be operated after every use or after a certain number of users per day.

103
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:49.301
Each night,

104
00:06:49.301 --> 00:06:53.050
the toilets would close for 10 minutes while the unit undertakes a deep clean.

105
00:06:53.051 --> 00:06:55.870
Wow, this is some weird Robocop.

106
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.540
Visitors will have to pay to use the toilets.

107
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.480
<v 0>What, what.</v>

108
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.590
<v 1>Why would you have to pay to use? Take a. Hey, Oh man.</v>

109
00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:09.880
If I was going to a place and you had to pay to take a, guess what? I'm doing.

110
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:15.340
And outside of it right there, bro. I'll close to where you pay.

111
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.510
You think I won't. Close to where you pay. That's the real for real.

112
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.740
You're going to make me pay the. Where's the doorway dude. Here we go.

113
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:31.120
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

114
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.600
<v 1>Oh, what's he doing bro? You're not charging me to take dumps.</v>

115
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:42.790
Oh, that guy's crazy. What the? Oh,

116
00:07:42.791 --> 00:07:45.160
I see outside the doorway because there were Oh,

117
00:07:45.161 --> 00:07:46.360
because they wanted me to pay for it.

118
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:54.460
God he knows the rules. Doesn't he? God he lives a sound life. God.

119
00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:59.050
He's got a code like Dexter. This is coming out anyway.

120
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:00.850
You're not gonna make me pay for it.

121
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.810
Um, however, Twitter users have questions. How the systems in particular,

122
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.970
the weight sensitive floors would work in practice.

123
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:17.830
One said just the fact that anyone would tweet about this one said weight

124
00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:19.750
sensitive floors did detect more than one user.

125
00:08:19.751 --> 00:08:23.710
What baseline weight are they using? I'm easily the weight of two teenagers.

126
00:08:23.711 --> 00:08:28.600
And what about people who need assistance? I have to go in with my kids. Oh man.

127
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.940
Imagine you walk in with your two kids that need to take a.

128
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.770
And all of a sudden they douse you with water and alarm goes off and the doors

129
00:08:35.771 --> 00:08:39.250
open and then they think you're a pedophile by the way. Oh,

130
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.010
you went in with kids. He's trying to kids. What the?

131
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:45.790
You're just an American in there. I was on vacation in Griffith Griffin park.

132
00:08:45.791 --> 00:08:49.180
I don't know what's happening, dude. What the is happening?

133
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:52.510
<v 0>Oh no.</v>

134
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.880
<v 1>Oh yeah. You need to take your. Oh, let's all go in together. Cause I don't.</v>

135
00:08:54.881 --> 00:08:55.681
I trust anybody.

136
00:08:55.681 --> 00:08:58.530
We all got to get in to get in there and this is a family and every I,

137
00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:59.373
here we go. I forget.

138
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.900
<v 2>Oh no. What the is going on? Oh no. Wait, what the? Hi.</v>

139
00:09:05.901 --> 00:09:07.790
C'mon kids here with town now.

140
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.253
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

141
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.260
<v 1>Another added.</v>

142
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:22.280
There are obvious serious questions about weight sensors with potential for

143
00:09:22.281 --> 00:09:26.480
cruel humiliation of facility users. As the robot.

144
00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.730
<v 2>Concerned with one thing, there are a,</v>

145
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:34.580
be a serious questions about weight sensors.

146
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:37.850
They'll put in Chiala for a Cruella humiliation.

147
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.120
<v 1>No facility users. I would like to take a.</v>

148
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.820
I weigh an excess of three on Rhoda in 10 pounds.

149
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:49.873
Oh.

150
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:57.020
<v 2>Oh my circuitry. Oh, water.</v>

151
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.140
<v 0>Okay.</v>

152
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.350
<v 2>Why would you listen to this podcast? Dude? There's NPR.</v>

153
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:12.500
<v 0>Okay.</v>

154
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:16.190
<v 2>Talking about robots in whales and getting blasted.</v>

155
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.900
The it's an escape from reality dude. That's like man,

156
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.830
[inaudible] um,
