00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.780
<v 0>But like Tom Cruise was like,</v>

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.750
is like so famous. And then he did the crazy,

3
00:00:09.751 --> 00:00:13.050
like I'm in love, I'm in love, you know,

4
00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:15.630
with Katie Holmes and then got like,

5
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.690
people started talking about how he was in Scientology Institute and then got a

6
00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:22.170
little bit, people were like, Whoa, what's going on? And then for sure,

7
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.280
his PR told him to shut that down because he stopped doing that.

8
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.500
And then he just kind of was like, okay, well let me just do book,

9
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.090
ghost protocol and take on my craziness in how I am just going to run across

10
00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:38.070
buildings with a wire tethered to the top. Like, like I'm a tetherball dude.

11
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.910
Tom cruise was a straight up tetherball in that movie, man, ghost protocol,

12
00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:47.250
you know the name of it. Ha

13
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.030
ghost protocol.

14
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.650
I feel like that mission impossible movie was the big you as like, okay,

15
00:00:55.651 --> 00:00:58.920
you're going to let us get away with calling them whatever we want. Let's see.

16
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.380
Ghost protocol. What was the thing?

17
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.150
Tweet that Delaney did Rob Delaney about

18
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.760
ghost protocol. It made me laugh so hard.

19
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.300
It was when it came out and he was like alternate names that they were going to

20
00:01:14.301 --> 00:01:18.230
use. Rob Delaney. And it was ghost protocol.

21
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.110
What were the names? Is it down there? It would probably be the top one now.

22
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.170
Right. Protocol to writing protocol up there.

23
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.140
And that's a hundred percent obvious one fire.

24
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.700
<v 1>Uh, well.</v>

25
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.240
<v 0>Let's just read all of his tweets that say about cost protocol.</v>

26
00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:41.540
I bet he's so he did Rob Delaney. So funny. Uh,

27
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.933
I mean, do it,

28
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.450
I think he was on a tear with the movie on, I only actually fist fight my dad.

29
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.740
The only actual, the only I love when he,

30
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.380
the only where did it go, the only app full fist fight.

31
00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:06.500
My dad and I ever got into was when I said Tom Cruise's hair looked coolest,

32
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.000
Helen [inaudible] protocol. And he laughed go down a little more.

33
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.290
Oh, here we go. Title's considered for mission impossible.

34
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.100
<v 1>Oh, here we go. Click on that. He wrote op.</v>

35
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.690
<v 0>Probably get him, bro. I'll probably get in trouble for posting this,</v>

36
00:02:26.691 --> 00:02:30.710
but I found a document at paramount pictures that lists the titles they

37
00:02:30.711 --> 00:02:32.360
considered for the new mission.

38
00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:36.470
Impossible film before settling on the excellent ghost protocol,

39
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.250
please repost in case they take it down from my site. Mission,

40
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:44.720
impossible loaf, mission, impossible,

41
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.420
plop, centrifuge, centrifuge,

42
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.080
mission, impossible con Sullivan.

43
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.680
Wow. This is what the internet was made for mission impossible.

44
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.150
Beef pamphlets

45
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.270
Missing impossible frost, debutantes,

46
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.210
like kids said the next one it's got the N-word and

47
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.050
Mitch calibrate Fern gabled tooth peach bottle,

48
00:03:22.051 --> 00:03:24.810
top North wiggle down

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.590
blankets. Squirt w wow. He's funny, dude.

50
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.000
That guy's funny as, huh? It's annoying.

51
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.810
Our funny idiot. He is passive.

52
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.850
<v 1>Accident. Moreover.</v>

53
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.073
<v 2>Ward on my mind,</v>

54
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.170
call it Tom cruise on Tom cruise Scientologist.

55
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.960
I think it's a privilege to call yourself a Scientologist.

56
00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.160
And it's something that you have to earn.

57
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.170
And because Scientologists does he.

58
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.810
<v 0>A Scientologist, does.</v>

59
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.020
<v 2>She has the ability to create new and better realities and</v>

60
00:04:13.021 --> 00:04:17.790
improve conditions, uh, being Scientologists. You look at someone and you know,

61
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.260
absolutely that you can help them.

62
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.570
<v 0>Well, you know, just killing it at life.</v>

63
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.180
I want to be like that. I want to just walk, that, dude.

64
00:04:33.181 --> 00:04:37.710
I'm going to be Scientologist. I want to just walk into a room and just,

65
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.190
no, do you understand what I'm saying? A blanket

66
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.160
knowledge of what the is going on.

67
00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:48.450
And I swear to God too.

68
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.260
I'll not only they laid that song over the mission,

69
00:04:52.261 --> 00:04:57.120
impossible song over this for some reason,

70
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.950
but I'll bring a straight up, not iPhone iPod,

71
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.240
a separate iPod with speakers that connect and don't

72
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.520
Bluetooth in and I will straight up play

73
00:05:11.521 --> 00:05:12.570
it case.

74
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.700
<v 2>While I walked in the room. It's, it's something that</v>

75
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.270
I don't mince words with, that we know bro,

76
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.890
with anything I'm a Scientologist policy to me has really gone well,

77
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.830
how do I do it? Every I know I just kind of went through and said,

78
00:05:28.831 --> 00:05:33.750
you know what? When I read it, I just went.

79
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.200
Yes. It said is exactly it.

80
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.260
<v 0>Go said nothing. And that's what I want to do.</v>

81
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.950
When people ask me about Scientology and I'm focused straight right now,

82
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.120
whatever the first step is, I did it probably realizing that you want to be it.

83
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.030
You know, that's probably what it is. If you look at the Scientology book,

84
00:05:51.031 --> 00:05:54.660
they're like, yo, first step is straight up realizing you want it.

85
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.070
You need help. There we go. I'm on my babies.

86
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.870
And I go and I go like this and I go and I go and people ask me about

87
00:06:04.871 --> 00:06:07.150
Scientology and, whenever I finished the program,

88
00:06:07.151 --> 00:06:11.170
whenever they get all their dirt on me or whatever they go, like,

89
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.900
they go like now you're cytologists because you gave us some dirt and I go like

90
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.970
this. Cool. And then people say, what's up with psychologist.

91
00:06:15.971 --> 00:06:18.700
And I go like this dude, when I looked at Scientology straight up,

92
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.000
the thing was, was like a light bulb went off. Like I looked at it and I,

93
00:06:22.001 --> 00:06:24.220
and I read what it was about. And our first, when I first saw it,

94
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.740
I was just like, forget it. I was like, forget it.

95
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.690
And then somebody asked me about it.

96
00:06:28.691 --> 00:06:30.910
And that was the first time they talked about and I was like, what's going on?

97
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.450
And they looked at me and I was like, you know what? I know, I know what's up.

98
00:06:34.451 --> 00:06:37.420
I walk into a room and you just, you feel it right.

99
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.380
He or she can walk into a room and just feel it. And I get an a very,

100
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.030
and that's the thing. What's the thing. The thing is, is just,

101
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.010
you know, it's a being, it's a presence.

102
00:06:48.011 --> 00:06:49.990
It's an essence where you walk in and you just,

103
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.380
you have that because you've done the steps and you've worked and now you're

104
00:06:53.381 --> 00:06:55.690
mashed potatoes and people are just like, wait, what? And you're just like, no,

105
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.720
now your mashed potatoes. I was like, well, he didn't really say much.

106
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:04.150
He definitely said he was mashed potatoes. That's the thing about Scientology.

107
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.540
You know, you know, you walk in and like a light bulb went off.

108
00:07:07.541 --> 00:07:09.490
When you first read those words, you read that. And you know,

109
00:07:09.491 --> 00:07:12.250
a light bulb went off and you're finding, you know, that you can help and,

110
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.180
and all of a sudden your mashed potatoes and it's all good. And they're like,

111
00:07:16.181 --> 00:07:17.014
wait, what?

112
00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.320
<v 1>I'm gonna get dirt on you. And your mashed potatoes.</v>

113
00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.410
<v 0>Cruz straight up, looked at an interviewer and said, I'm mashed potatoes.</v>

114
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.280
They would believe it. That's the thing I want to get to.
