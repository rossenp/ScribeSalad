00:02:42.981 --> 00:02:44.120
I call you guys babies.

31
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.240
Don't come up to me and say and call me dad.

32
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.490
People think it's like, nah, I'm not dad, dude,

33
00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.910
daddy, all right. People, some guy came up to me and said,

34
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:04.690
can I get a pick? And he started taking a video and I was like, and I was like,

35
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.050
ah, what are you doing bro? And he was like, Hey, I'm with my dude.

36
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:11.890
He was so nervous. First of all, he's shaking. And he said, Hey,

37
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:15.600
what's up Instagram? I'm with my grandpa. Oh

38
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.880
dude, you're a mistake.

39
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.340
I'm with my grand Pappy. Ah,

40
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.180
that was ultimate cringe. I literally on his V I'm on his video going like this.

41
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.640
Ah, what? You get the real deal when you come out, dude.

42
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.660
Uh, okay.

43
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.740
Here's a good one. Rob M at Rob Materra 27. All right, cool.

44
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.060
Find no change in involved.

45
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.350
Saw this woman while driving yesterday and rolled my window down to give her a

46
00:03:55.351 --> 00:03:57.060
drive by, Hey,

47
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.700
your thoughts on this loon and what she's protesting. Okay.

48
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.130
So she's just next to a stop sign.

49
00:04:05.131 --> 00:04:09.180
And this big S banner says

50
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.880
danger. And then under it,

51
00:04:11.881 --> 00:04:16.620
robotic equipment is being implanted into you and your kids during surgery

52
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.990
with your awning, with your informed consent. That with what? Oh,

53
00:04:21.991 --> 00:04:25.860
without your informed consent. Sorry. She's not holding the banner, right?

54
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.460
If you're going to go through the whole trouble, hold the banner, right?

55
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.770
You've got a huge banner. Get a friend. Oh,

56
00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:34.650
but you don't have any because you're alone.

57
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.690
This means slavery. Oh,

58
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.110
it gets real morbid at the end, during surgery, without your informed consent.

59
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.610
This means slavery and torture by remote

60
00:04:47.611 --> 00:04:51.390
control until you die,

61
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.820
dude, this guy took this picture.

62
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.800
What a shot also get a better location.

63
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.331
She's just in,

64
00:05:00.331 --> 00:05:05.100
you know where she is some neighborhood near a stop sign, dude.

65
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.340
Where is it? See if you can see, where did he put that location?

66
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.650
Robot equipment is not being implanted in your who's this

67
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.760
who's holding. Who's behind this sign.

68
00:05:17.761 --> 00:05:21.930
Sam Tripoli dude say Arville New Jersey.

69
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.030
I've played there before. I think, wow man, New Jersey,

70
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.160
nothings. Who's the crazier state, Florida or New Jersey.

71
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.700
I'd have to say Florida because of how big it is. But man,

72
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.920
nothing's more New Jersey than Florida.

73
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.590
Nothing's more New Jersey than a New Jersey guy moving down to Florida and being

74
00:05:43.591 --> 00:05:47.490
in Florida. That's the most New Jersey you can be.

75
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.470
It's like when I found out that, um, a while ago, I don't know if he still does,

76
00:05:52.471 --> 00:05:55.290
but Johnny Depp lives in Paris. I was like, dude,

77
00:05:55.291 --> 00:05:57.000
that's the most Hollywood you can,

78
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.880
nothing's more New Jersey than living in Florida.

79
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.520
And just having a belly, you know like, yeah. You know,

80
00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:10.520
I like it because you know, it doesn't get cold. I can't deal with the cold.

81
00:06:10.521 --> 00:06:12.800
You know, I can't deal with the seasons. I honestly I've.

82
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.610
I've dealt with the seasons for 54 years. I can't deal with it anymore.

83
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.520
I got to come down here. I got to catch some rays. That's it. That's it.

84
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:20.301
I come out here,

85
00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:23.690
I eat my bologna sandwiches and I smoke a cigar and I'm going to do that.

86
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:26.060
And I'll tell you what, if it shaves life off the back of my,

87
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.050
the end of my life. It doesn't matter because those are the bad years. Anyway,

88
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.280
I'm talking about I'm living as best as I can from now until I was yes, Stott.

89
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.650
And that's it. And that's it.

90
00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.670
Muck bang, YouTube culture.

91
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.680
Brianna Marie prosper at Qataris Pollux. Okay. Change it.

92
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:52.623
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

93
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.780
<v 0>Chris, have you talked to muck bang, YouTube culture yet?</v>

94
00:06:55.781 --> 00:06:57.040
Congratulate smart observing report.

95
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.450
It that's my one far is saying people eat a lot of food, muck bang

96
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.780
while they talk while they okay. I'm looking it up.

97
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.630
Muck bang. Oh,

98
00:07:10.631 --> 00:07:14.800
it's that Korean where they eat like squids and, and break,

99
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:20.410
yeah, that's gross. I can't, I can't watch that.

100
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.393
You know what?

101
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.840
Eating is honestly a private thing.

102
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.350
Even restaurants. It's like, what the are we doing?

103
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.350
We're all getting together to shove in our faces.

104
00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.800
It seems like it should be like sex.

105
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:45.730
You don't. You know, in public and. You don't eating is like an,

106
00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:50.170
it should be like a, it's so intimate.

107
00:07:50.171 --> 00:07:53.950
We're inserting. You know, it's just gross.

108
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.280
Most people, unless you're hot as,

109
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.880
unless you're a nine or above,

110
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:05.800
you should just be eating by yourself in your house. Dude. If you're at 10,

111
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:10.450
restaurants should only be for tens. For real.

112
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.410
Like even I, I, I think I, I like to consider myself. I, you know,

113
00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:18.370
I'd like to take care of my body. Like if you try hard, maybe, you know,

114
00:08:18.371 --> 00:08:21.250
with your body and work out and you, you tried, you know,

115
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:26.380
mostly on only people who should be eating in restaurants or hot chicks that

116
00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:29.350
don't use that much makeup. Cause that's gross to eat with a bunch of makeup on.

117
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.850
Or if you're like a top notch, good looking dude, like

118
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.010
Brad Pitt, Tom cruise, you know what I mean? I'm talking about Paul Walker.

119
00:08:39.011 --> 00:08:41.980
If he was alive, rest in peace. He could be at a restaurant,

120
00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:46.570
maybe Hugh Jackman. I don't really know. I haven't seen him up close,

121
00:08:46.571 --> 00:08:50.770
but like Ryan Reynolds, I guess I could eat with his wife out in public.

122
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.740
But like, bro, you're just going to look like a

123
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.530
grow sky and then put stuff in your face,

124
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.400
in public with other like no Eden private.

125
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.210
So muck bang, go yourself. Okay.

126
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.790
Eating for all the world to see gross.

127
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.370
At least I can click on the link of our PR if I, if I choose,

128
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:16.620
but like just mostly eating private. Okay.

129
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:18.480
Private.
