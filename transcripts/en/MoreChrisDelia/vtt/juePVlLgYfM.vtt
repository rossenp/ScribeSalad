00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.700
<v 0>I looked at Christmas trees, man.</v>

2
00:00:02.701 --> 00:00:06.000
I went to this place that just an incredible place that has all these Christmas

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:09.540
trees. I can't even remember where it was, but dude,

4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.810
man Christmas is when did Christmas jumped the shark? Look, I love Christmas.

5
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.910
It's also so annoying when people talk about how

6
00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:24.060
it's annoying, that that Christmas decorations go up too early.

7
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.160
It doesn't matter. It's one of those things that it's like you,

8
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.110
it's annoying as it's as annoying as what you're annoying annoyed about

9
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.200
what you're doing. You know, it's like, it's,

10
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.180
it's like just Christmas is coming it's and calming.

11
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.010
Christmas is coming and it's fine. It's fine. Christmas is coming,

12
00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:50.010
you know, but if you want to be, you know,

13
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.110
not involved in it, then don't be involved in it when people are like in LA,

14
00:00:55.111 --> 00:00:58.440
like, Oh, I hate you. You go to the Grove and it's, first of all,

15
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.130
don't go to the Grove. Okay. If you go to the Grove,

16
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.890
you're going to have the most Gropius experience of all time.

17
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.660
And the most Gropius experience of all time is Christmas at the Grove in LA,

18
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.760
you go to the Grove and it's like, during Christmas time you have like a,

19
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.730
it's like an outdoor mall or whatever. LA has some outdoor malls.

20
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.250
Cause it never rains. Why would you live anywhere else? And so,

21
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.690
and so they ha they decorated in like August,

22
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.130
starting for Christmas because they want to make bags and they want to remain

23
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.560
downloads. And I get it, dude, they wanna remain dollars. But um,

24
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.800
people complain about it. It it's the most annoying thing.

25
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:41.850
It's not that annoying when you go to the Grove and there's Garland around who

26
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:42.684
cares?

27
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.660
You're just don't look at it or don't go to top shop, you know,

28
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.330
where you can get a shoot for $25 a three-piece suit for $25 in that rips on the

29
00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:55.164
red carpet.

30
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.930
Oh really? Hey Tom. You're at top shop. Hey, how much is this three-piece suit?

31
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.580
17 bucks. Really? Yeah. Can I try it on? No, it'll rip. All right. I'll take it.

32
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.920
You know, it's like H and M when you're like, Whoa,

33
00:02:13.921 --> 00:02:18.240
this jacket is pretty gnarly, dude. I'm going to get this cool. Ring it up,

34
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.470
dude. Accept it. Boom. Sign here. Great sign. Cool. Yeah.

35
00:02:22.471 --> 00:02:25.740
Let me just say head on out of the shop and get, get to my car. Okay. Bye guys.

36
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.040
[inaudible] what's H and M Stanford. Holy moly.

37
00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:36.540
It's going to rip soon. Yeah, dude.

38
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.640
It, this is another podcast. We will cut that part out. Oh, we don't do it.

39
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.130
Which seasons get Holy moly. H and M Holly. Molly.

40
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.450
Uh, yeah, so I saw a Christmas tree with the flamingos all over it by

41
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.590
Hey, big tall flamingos all over the Christmas tree. You know,

42
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.790
don't put things as big as the Christmas tree on the Christmas tree,

43
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.010
you know, Christmas tree with the big,

44
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.390
some people will put big presence in the Christmas tree.

45
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.060
Like to hang them up on there. It looks bad.

46
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.960
Now I'm going to be honest with you. It looks bad also,

47
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.760
dude. Christmas is coming. Okay. And,

48
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.980
and if you're annoyed that Christmas is coming,

49
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.700
we'll be annoyed at the podcast because this podcast is saying Christmas is

50
00:03:26.701 --> 00:03:30.930
coming and it's already, it's only November. Okay. But

51
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.170
it's never a Flamingo Christmas. Okay. Sometimes I see things online.

52
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.070
I think online, it's a very Merry Flamingo Christmas. Guess what?

53
00:03:41.071 --> 00:03:43.380
It's not ever a Flamingo Christmas,

54
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.850
but dude, I saw ones with like, I mean there's somewhere with Christmas,

55
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.410
with the sharks on it and probably,

56
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.540
but there's so much decorations on Christmas trees in these Christmas tree

57
00:03:57.541 --> 00:04:00.660
places. And I get it is because this is their life and this is their,

58
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.580
they can start getting rid of this, these Christmas.

59
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.250
It's like those Halloween shops that are just only,

60
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.550
they only really function in October. And it's like, how?

61
00:04:08.551 --> 00:04:12.180
You're not going out of business. These Christmas places,

62
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.660
they're ready to get. They're ready to get going in August. You know?

63
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.610
So you, so they decorate every last part. It's like my mom on meth.

64
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.230
My mom, if you go to her house,

65
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.410
every little place has got chotchkies all over it. Do I hate it? Yes.

66
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.150
Is she my mom? Yes. Do I love her still? Yes, but dude,

67
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.550
chotchkies everywhere man. And uh, this Christmas place, they got Bose,

68
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.230
they got tinsel. They've got flamingos. They've got, uh,

69
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.280
and it's just so much to it.

70
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.733
Anyway,

71
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.510
what I like is red and green.

72
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.200
And I like the Christmas trees that are,

73
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.400
the ornaments are hung up different ornaments. So it looks like a family did it.

74
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.350
I don't like this store-bought. Why would you take that feeling at a Christmas?

75
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.420
Is your house, your house or is it Bloomingdale's? You know,

76
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.790
if you have kids make the kids hang up the school bus ornaments or whatever,

77
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.340
you know, that's it.

78
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.650
Um, my, my grandpa would, would, would, would,

79
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.810
would have his kid, his kids do the trees and my, which was my dad.

80
00:05:33.811 --> 00:05:38.370
Obviously, if you know anything about lineage and my, and he would be like,

81
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.340
he would sit in his chair and it would be like,

82
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.480
put it that go right there. That's where that one goes.

83
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.370
And my dad would be like here and from the chair,

84
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.820
my grandpa Ben will be like, no, right, dad,

85
00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.070
my dad would be like one here. Now there's a spot right there. Right here.

86
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.810
Right. There's where I'm pointing. Not there, there.

87
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:07.670
And he'd be like 20 feet out.

88
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.780
That's what I'm going to do to my kid. Dude. Put it there. Where there,

89
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.250
where there? Right here that I say they're there and he's going to be three.

90
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.940
I don't know what to do. Where to put, this is too high to put up there.

91
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.280
I can't get up there.

92
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>

93
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.460
<v 0>Use a step stool. Have your mother hold you up. They're there. Hey you,</v>

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.270
Have your mother home him. hold on there.

100
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.320
Hang up the star on this one. Is that the top there?

101
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.750
Um, dude, I can't wait to have kids and make them crazy as, dude.

102
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:14.500
Um, yeah. So, and also, Hey, I got some news for you, man.

106
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.870
Call it a Subaru. What's it matter, dude.

107
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:35.110
It's green and you're hang school. Bus ornaments on it.

108
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.870
You put tensile all over it. Who cares? There was this one guy who tweeted.

109
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:46.240
This is not a holiday tree. It's a Christmas tree. Okay. Okay. Okay.

110
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:53.140
All right. Cool. Good. Have a have, have, have dinner. What do I give a?

111
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.450
You call it. You call it when someone gets mad. Hey,

112
00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.850
this is a Christmas tree. Oh, okay. You mean the holiday tree?

113
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:06.160
Imagine being like, no, no, no. I mean Christmas tree. Imagine getting that mad.

114
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.700
If I say that's a Christmas tree, you mean holiday tree. I go like this. Yeah.

115
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.630
Right. Dad who gives a?

116
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:20.590
The people who are outraged, it should stop with the people who are outraged.

117
00:08:20.591 --> 00:08:24.040
You don't get more outraged. Who gives a, man, that being said,

118
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:29.410
sometimes your boy gets outraged. But yeah, man,

119
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.320
that's so weird. When somebody gets mad, this isn't a, um,

120
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.340
a holiday candle. This is a,

121
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.690
what do they call the Hanukkah things menorah.

122
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.570
So now is it weird that menorah,

123
00:08:46.571 --> 00:08:49.450
if you shorten the word it's manure and that means. Yes.

124
00:08:49.451 --> 00:08:53.170
Have I always thought that? Yes. What came first?

125
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.380
Menorah or manure does? No,

126
00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:00.690
but I'm pretty sure her she's were for centuries and centuries.

127
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.440
Why wouldn't, why didn't you? Why weren't Jews like, Oh boy,

128
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:09.120
maybe we should change it. Let's call it a menorah.

129
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.700
Well, okay. But that sounds like horse.

130
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:16.530
What the hell does it matter? Ho, CAS light him up.

131
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.433
<v 1>Ah.</v>

132
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:25.730
<v 0>What should we call it? Poopy candles. A menorah.</v>

133
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:26.953
Well,

134
00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:32.270
can't call the poopy poopy candles or not because it's got poopy in it.

135
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:33.980
Menorah. It is. Hi.

136
00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.220
<v 1>Dude. Whatever you can't get mad at me. I'm Jewish.</v>

137
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.300
<v 0>I don't dude,</v>

138
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:53.270
Man, people are so, I don't want to always talk about how people are outraged,

139
00:09:53.271 --> 00:09:57.980
but everybody's outrageous and get their holiday trees or holiday candles.
