1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.150
<v 0>Anyway. Um, I want to talk about this though,</v>

2
00:00:03.151 --> 00:00:06.990
because I've been talking about it on the podcast and it's just unbelievable.

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.900
I, I,

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.240
I talked about the movie cats episodes ago when I was in, uh,

5
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.160
Albuquerque and it was way before the movie

6
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:20.994
was coming out.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.200
I think I found out that day that cats was coming out and I couldn't believe it.

8
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.000
Okay. And I realized that cats is a campy. Cool.

9
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.620
Can't be thing that was supposed to be made as a musical in the eighties.

10
00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:35.490
I think it was made,

11
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.230
which is crazy by the way that it was even made in the eighties

12
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.760
and not the 1840s. Okay. Because you know why,

13
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.710
because it's such a bad idea to have singing and dancing cats around. Okay.

14
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.030
Period. Now,

15
00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:54.560
somehow it hooked in to the culture or the vibe or the

16
00:00:54.561 --> 00:00:59.180
LSD times of the eighties or whatever that it blew up and became a movie

17
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.390
or a, a musical that everyone went to go see.

18
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.110
And there were some jamming songs on it that Barbara Streisand has got famous

19
00:01:06.111 --> 00:01:07.790
singing for one of them. You know what I mean?

20
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.770
Mammaries and that's just a taste. Okay.

21
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.490
People ask if I could sing, I go, you do the mathematics.

22
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.010
Emory means you do the math. Right.

23
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.030
But calculate that my babies.

24
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.130
So they did this thing musical and it blew up now Hollywood being Hollywood and

25
00:01:28.131 --> 00:01:32.780
being on original. Fine. Cool. They also do cool stuff. I get it.

26
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.790
But most of the part,

27
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.380
the money stuff is from the sequels and the reboot and right

28
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.780
now. They thought I love the exec. That was probably like, what about cats?

29
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.240
And then they were like, yeah,

30
00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:52.160
let's make cats not thinking about how stupid it will look

31
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.170
for sure. When they CGI humans with cats,

32
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.480
like standing up upright humans,

33
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.700
no standing up upright cats with human faces and no Teddy's in Cox.

34
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.070
All right. Okay. Oh,

35
00:02:10.071 --> 00:02:12.830
Taylor Swift is gorgeous. Well,

36
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.700
let's take that out of the equation and make her a cat.

37
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.400
Okay. Now they did this movie now on paper. Sounds bad as. Okay.

38
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.940
You know what? Sometimes I don't know. Sometimes I don't know.

39
00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:29.810
Sometimes they Hollywood surprises me. I'm usually right about this.

40
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.410
Did I know speed racing was going to be a tank? Yes. Was it? Yes.

41
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.400
Is it easy to usually tell a tank? Yes. Gemini man. Did I know? Yes.

42
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.830
All right. Uh, so they,

43
00:02:42.831 --> 00:02:44.870
they made this movie and the CG,

44
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.000
the trailer came out and once the trailer came

45
00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:51.980
out, they should have been like, you know what? We're going to cut our losses.

46
00:02:51.981 --> 00:02:53.660
We're not putting any money into advertisement, whatever,

47
00:02:53.661 --> 00:02:58.610
because it was a joke and it looked horrible. Okay. Now I knew it was going to,

48
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.330
I told you months and months.

49
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.163
<v 1>All right.</v>

50
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.760
<v 0>It has the craziest weirdest cast. Jason Derulo is in it by</v>

51
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.910
what's. His name from the late night is in it. Find late night show, show host.

52
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.140
Maybe a great actor just seems so calculated that you put them in cats by.

53
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:22.530
<v 1>Uh.</v>

54
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.860
<v 0>Idris Elba. Hey, that guy is too good.</v>

55
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.490
And so is Judy Dench. Don't put them in cats.

56
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.430
Judi Dench did an interview yesterday.

57
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.850
That CA where she said her character was training.

58
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.703
<v 1>Okay.</v>

59
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.050
<v 0>Then the end of 2019 goes to Judy Dench. Well, you know,</v>

60
00:03:49.051 --> 00:03:50.760
it's cause my character was trans.

61
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.713
<v 1>Okay.</v>

62
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.110
<v 0>Well I just drank and water came out everywhere, but that's how it goes, dude.</v>

63
00:04:01.111 --> 00:04:04.530
When you say stuff like that, I ruined my desk. Now.

64
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.120
That's what she said. Okay. Okay, cool. Judi, Dench, Dame,

65
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.380
Judi Dench or whatever

66
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.690
For sake. When they say like, or sir. Oh, Ian, McKellen's in it. Right,

67
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.610
sir. Ian McKellen and Dame, Judi Dench is in it. Hey, what the?

68
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.890
They're Knights and Queens or whatever. What are you doing?

69
00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:30.180
And putting them in a movie about cats, Ian McKellen's and it just like this,

70
00:04:30.181 --> 00:04:34.920
you know, you know the part where he's against the wall and he's just like,

71
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.330
And you, and he's literally thinking.

72
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.130
<v 1>It's because of the money.</v>

73
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.270
<v 0>That's what he was. So this is a movie and Jason Derulo is in it,</v>

74
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.090
which is real dude. It's unreal that they were like, well, we,

75
00:04:54.091 --> 00:04:57.210
you know, he's popular and he's sings and stuff.

76
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.720
So they put Jason Derulo, his handsome in there.

77
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.610
And then Jason Derulo did an interview on a radio station and was like,

78
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.330
Hey man. They said they had to CGI Macaca because it was just too big.

79
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.160
Hey no.

80
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.810
<v 1>No.</v>

81
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.450
<v 0>They didn't. No, they didn't.</v>

82
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.490
You know why they didn't CGI out because your is too big.

83
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.790
They CGI to out because it's a car.

84
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.120
<v 1>Okay.</v>

85
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.930
<v 0>You mean, if it was smaller, they wouldn't have imagined how weird it would be.</v>

86
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.460
A Jason Derulo came in just like mammaries and he just had a little

87
00:05:35.461 --> 00:05:39.030
nub protruding out of his between his cat legs.

88
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.180
No man. Stop trying to act all R and B and cats, dude.

89
00:05:44.181 --> 00:05:47.490
That's the thing too. When a tries to act all hard,

90
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.360
but it's still in cats. Hey dude,

91
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.320
you're trying to act hard. Like you got a big RMB deck,

92
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.970
but Yarin,

93
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.340
you're singing with Judy Dench,

94
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.270
Dude. Your, your is gone because it's a and this is a family movie.

95
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.510
Okay, bye Dylan. Then, then

96
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.830
you can't have a in a family movie period.

97
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.210
You can't have a character in a family movie period. Jason

98
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.600
decent [inaudible] [inaudible] dude.

99
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.670
You know, because [inaudible], can't see

100
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.670
 Janet dude, you can't, that was just the best. And then the interview was like, Oh wow. All right. So you got your 

101
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:35.503
Coxie jot out because okay. Okay. No way.

102
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.900
<v 1>[Inaudible] I just don't understand.</v>

103
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.140
<v 0>You know, you're in cats, dude. I'm losing my mind. It's fine.</v>

104
00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.490
Why do you listen to this? It's fine.

105
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.540
I, this podcast is like, not yet. And I have to listen, I guess, because like,

106
00:07:10.541 --> 00:07:13.630
it's like a thing and like I make money on it and it's like,

107
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.080
I gotta keep doing it. And like, I just told you that,

108
00:07:17.081 --> 00:07:19.600
like I had sex with a girl years ago and she said, my carcass.

109
00:07:19.601 --> 00:07:22.330
I didn't ever want to do that. Okay. I didn't ever want to do that.

110
00:07:22.331 --> 00:07:25.330
But you made me understand, you know, when Tupac is like,

111
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.410
I was raised in a society and they made me who I am.

112
00:07:29.411 --> 00:07:34.120
That's exactly what the is happening, dude. You're this society and I'm Tupac.

113
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.970
And you made me tell you that a girl had my carcass once.

114
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.700
So what the am I supposed to do now? Happy holidays.

115
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:42.940
I hope you're listening to this with a family.

116
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.003
<v 1>I just can't.</v>

117
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.950
<v 0>What you gone do with that big cat bot.</v>

118
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.450
What'd you go and do with that big cap.

119
00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:00.640
But they had to go to cat school by the way, which is like,

120
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.870
like, they were like, they were shooting band of brothers.

121
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.810
They had to go to weeks of cat school and they were like, Oh,

122
00:08:10.811 --> 00:08:13.450
how cool is it that we got to? We just had to dude,

123
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:17.380
what are you out of your mind? Just act like a cat

124
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:24.040
now, catchy. You know, there was some divorced guy that was just like, well, no,

125
00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:26.830
when cats, you know, move around, they move more with their. You know?

126
00:08:26.831 --> 00:08:31.000
You want to lead with the show? Well, imagine I had that part. Oh,

127
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:35.800
for sake. That's me in the back. What I got to leave?

128
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.040
Can I just walk and walk around like a cat? Well, you want to lead with it?

129
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:42.130
All right, dude. Are you serious? Jason, are you going to do it?

130
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:47.380
You're cool with this, Mr. RMBS you're good with it.

131
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.160
I know. Taylor's obviously good with it. And he just, y'all just, you just,

132
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.700
all his obviously into it because he's 50 and just started deejaying.

133
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.010
But come on, dude. Dame, Judi Dench. Of course she is.

134
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.230
She make him call her Dame. Judi Dench, sir. Ian McKellen. Honestly,

135
00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:07.920
he's not even really that into and he's gay and this is a musical.

136
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.940
Um, yeah, dude. Oh,

137
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.250
one fire brought up something on vulture. Ian McKellen learns to sniff.

138
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.130
I don't know what this is, but I'm going to read it.

139
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.430
Dowling set up a multi-step curriculum for teaching actors and dancers.

140
00:09:26.431 --> 00:09:27.300
How to move like a,

141
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.460
it doesn't even say cat dude to move like a gelical cat

142
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.980
Dude. A gelical cat is nothing. Okay.

143
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:43.500
Also. I bet I know how they move. It's just like a cat.

144
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.240
So get outta here with that gelical.

145
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.780
She started with a basic cat anatomy. She started with basic cat anatomy,

146
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:56.160
anatomy and behavior, and then made it more gelical no,

147
00:09:56.161 --> 00:09:59.280
I'm kidding. Doesn't say that she started with basic cat anatomy and behavior,

148
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:05.490
teaching people through videos or lecture lectures about the specific specifics

149
00:10:05.491 --> 00:10:08.190
of cat movement lectures, dude. Hey,

150
00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:11.550
let's try to make it more assholey she would have.

151
00:10:11.551 --> 00:10:14.910
Then she would then have the actors play as cats and instruct them.

152
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.590
Imagine you get that part and you're just licking your wrist next to Taylor

153
00:10:19.591 --> 00:10:23.580
Swift than Judy Dench. And you're just like, what is my life? What is going on?

154
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:28.680
And then you look over and Jason Derulo is in some tight jeans and off

155
00:10:28.681 --> 00:10:32.970
lights just licking his wrist. And you're like, what is happening?

156
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.060
This is real life that happened. Okay.

157
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:40.290
She would then have the exercises for instance, to say hello,

158
00:10:40.291 --> 00:10:43.020
by coming up to one another and bump noses. Kay.

159
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:44.700
<v 1>Are.</v>

160
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:49.650
<v 0>You me? Okay.</v>

161
00:10:49.651 --> 00:10:53.040
Now walk up. Now everyone walk up and bump noses to each other. I go like this,

162
00:10:53.041 --> 00:10:55.470
okay. But I'm doing it with Jason Derulo. I'm not doing with anybody else.

163
00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.930
Jason drew was my partner in this. Do you understand me?

164
00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.540
Or I'm struck or on per and off,

165
00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:09.590
uh, they learned how to sit as a cat and or how to sniff before they see

166
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.520
to re also they're not cats, dude. They're humans.

167
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.870
So don't need to do that so much busy work shoot the

168
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:21.740
movie, you know, put it in front of green screen.

169
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:26.990
I just did a zombie movie and I play a human and I still had to pose in front of

170
00:11:26.991 --> 00:11:29.150
green screen and do all this. So they come in and be my body.

171
00:11:29.151 --> 00:11:31.820
However they want to. And I'm playing a human.

172
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:37.370
Uh, they react to things less with their eyes and with their ears and noses.

173
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:41.960
Ian McKellen was apparently especially enamored with this part of the process.

174
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:46.280
Uh, just imagine, yeah, go down more. Imagine here's something,

175
00:11:46.281 --> 00:11:50.540
you move your head. There you go. Okay. Class dismissed.

176
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.820
<v 1>On.</v>

177
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.880
<v 0>The day, uh, on the day we learned how cats greet one another.</v>

178
00:11:57.881 --> 00:11:58.660
I was paired with serene.

179
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:02.260
McKelly Robert Fairchild said the former New York ballet dancer and Tony nominee

180
00:12:02.261 --> 00:12:06.340
who plays a narrator. Monka strap said, you go 40.

181
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.220
Now all this will be fine. If the movie made a hundred million dollars,

182
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.710
but it made $6.5 million, dude,

183
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:15.910
this will be made $6.5 million opening weekend. Dude,

184
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.820
my friends make more money than that a year.

185
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.370
This is cats.

186
00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:26.520
Look at this.

187
00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.390
You go four inches away from each other and from each other's face and from each

188
00:12:30.391 --> 00:12:33.180
other's faces and just start smelling. And if you like each other,

189
00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.010
get tap noses and rub on each other.

190
00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:38.820
I'm four inches away from Gandalf and we're there for 15 seconds.

191
00:12:38.821 --> 00:12:43.380
And then I go for it. I go in and he goes, no, no, no, not yet.

192
00:12:43.381 --> 00:12:48.000
I'm not ready. When I relayed that anecdote to darling, she laughed.

193
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:51.600
Ian was really very thorough. Hard-working in his cat school.

194
00:12:51.601 --> 00:12:56.550
He said we did a lot of it with him. He's a good actor, man. I mean,

195
00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.940
you know, wait, go up, go up, go. The visitor,

196
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.210
everyone needs cat practice. Taylor Swift less. So.

197
00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:07.350
<v 1>Okay. Keep going down.</v>

198
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.070
<v 0>How does a gelical cat?</v>

199
00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:16.360
How does a gelical cat on two legs? Does that, is there,

200
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.830
this is a vulture and they left the word out. One problem.

201
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:20.791
Deli went into the course, got cold,

202
00:13:20.791 --> 00:13:24.570
no matter how much the cast train moving as quickly as possible for legs.

203
00:13:24.571 --> 00:13:25.800
And we trained bloody long,

204
00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.500
they couldn't move fast enough to make some scenes work.

205
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:32.070
Some two legged movement was simply an inevitability

206
00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:39.240
As Jason Derulo put it. We're not just regular cats. We're cat people.

207
00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:44.220
That is true. And I sided with Jason to rely on that. Um,

208
00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:49.620
but yeah, dude, uh, wow.

209
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:55.170
I just love when they, when the actors like get, so that's the thing, dude,

210
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.380
acting is not that hard. It is. If you're playing the

211
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.040
real guy, the, the guy that you know,

212
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:06.600
or the girl that's like an actual emotional arc in a scene,

213
00:14:06.601 --> 00:14:09.390
or if you're playing somebody with like, you know, if you're,

214
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:12.810
if you don't have downs syndrome and Yoplait somebody with down syndrome,

215
00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:17.910
but dude cats just go out there and prance around.

216
00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.540
Or like my favorite is when the, when it's like, when it's like, uh,

217
00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:25.590
an army movie and they're like, well,

218
00:14:25.591 --> 00:14:30.120
we're going to go three months of basic training. And you're like,

219
00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:33.990
that's just my numbing dude. It's a waste of time.

220
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.780
I'll study the scene by scene.

221
00:14:36.781 --> 00:14:41.100
Why do I need to be out in the middle of the jungle and not sleep in my bed?

222
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:42.833
Because I, you know,

223
00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.560
because I need to hand somebody a Crock-Pot in a tent in a scene.

224
00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:50.700
It makes no sense. It makes no sense.

225
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:52.490
Oh yeah.

226
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:57.290
What does me being at basic training for sleeping over for four,

227
00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:01.760
four weeks? You know what I mean? In the, in, in wherever the.

228
00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.990
So I learned how to load a gun. Just teach me how to load the gun.

229
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.500
I already know how to load the gun, but I'll do it for your humor to humor you.

230
00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.020
But I gotta be at basic training for four weeks. Like we,

231
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.530
I don't know, man. I just don't. It's like they make it.

232
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:20.000
It's mostly easy acting. So they try to busy it up.

233
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:23.720
It's like that school report that it's like, when you come home and your,

234
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.300
and your mom's like, what do you have for work and for homework?

235
00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:28.850
And you're like, add, I got to do a report

236
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:34.700
Or I got to do a poll. I got to make a poster for a book I read, you know?

237
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:39.380
And then she's like, okay. And it takes 30 minutes. And she's like, well,

238
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.990
that sounds as long as it takes. And you're like, that's what they wanted.

239
00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.210
I'm like, well, take longer on it, make it better. And you're like,

240
00:15:44.211 --> 00:15:48.770
this is what they wanted my own do busy work, man. Like Jen Connery.

241
00:15:48.771 --> 00:15:51.650
She did busy work when, when I was in like fifth grade,

242
00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:57.680
wonder where she is now, man. Maybe she produce our cats. Wow.

243
00:15:57.681 --> 00:15:58.514
That'd be amazing.

244
00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:02.620
<v 1>Good for her. If she is good for Jen Conrey for producing cats.</v>

245
00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.173
aye.

246
00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:08.950
<v 0>I need, they honestly, I swear to God,</v>

247
00:16:08.951 --> 00:16:11.560
these studios need to hire me to just be yes or no.

248
00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:15.550
Is this movie going to do well, a course not is this no, is this yeah, sure.

249
00:16:15.551 --> 00:16:19.420
Yeah. Did, is this I'll be good at this too? Is this what we're going to do?

250
00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:22.720
Well, well, it's going to do well in Russia. You know what I mean? Why?

251
00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:26.380
Because it got so many like cars and guns in it like that kind of.

252
00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.560
<v 1>Dude. Gelical cat.</v>

253
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.400
<v 0>I talked too much about cats for real period.</v>
