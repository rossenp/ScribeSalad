00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.640
<v 0>In the locker room, somebody looks at me.</v>

2
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.960
I make straight heterosexual eye contact with them.

3
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.790
I don't around. Look at my, if they look at my, I look back. I go,

4
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.210
that's what happened, baby? That's what God gave me.

5
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.120
I got that Pat, Pat, Pat.

6
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.160
I got that pap dude.

7
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.320
I don't, you know, I'm not covering my enough in the locker room.

8
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.060
I'm not covering my and a locker room. Dude.

9
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.740
That's like an M and M lyric and the lack of room

10
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.683
and room.

11
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.920
I'm not the kind of gown coming to the CAC and his luck.

12
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.100
You got it seem a little penis and meanness and being a Dean is go home.

13
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.430
Do not mix me up with a gang. Okay.

14
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.540
Cummins is CAC and through to, he runs everything for real,

15
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.720
none of that rhymes do not mix

16
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.830
[inaudible] and everyone was like, Whoa, how does he find everything that runs?

17
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.570
He doesn't dude, you never find a penis to mean it's Dean. Dean is a bean.

18
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.730
It's only in the bean Nina's and then ring them. Williams,

19
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.990
peanuts, peanuts, Serena Williams, Serena Williams. Doesn't run with penis,

20
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.890
Forrest Gump, and an orange Trump be like, all right, I guess

21
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.300
I'm a forest Gump Marine, orange Trump.

22
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.780
But I'm thinking one of mine is going to come from a character

23
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.880
[inaudible] and dude,

24
00:02:01.881 --> 00:02:06.410
and 45 year old white dudes are like, that's so good.

25
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.860
How 45 years old is it to like M and M and S and think he's the best rapper.

26
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.840
I'm not dogging on Eminem, dude.

27
00:02:14.841 --> 00:02:18.530
The guy's one of the best rappers of all time.

28
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.100
It's just so funny to think of a 45 year old guy named like Derek.

29
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.330
That's just like, Oh man, Eminem is the greatest rapper, right? Like that.

30
00:02:26.331 --> 00:02:28.000
You know what that is? That's so lucky.

31
00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:31.670
And yadda dad to think M and M is so it's.

32
00:02:31.671 --> 00:02:34.810
So dad from Pasadena to be like, I'm an M is, is,

33
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.860
is great because he's a lyricist, like it's, some of his stuff is poetry.

34
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.950
Some of the stuff is poetry. You know, a guy, a white guy.

35
00:02:42.951 --> 00:02:47.600
Who's 45 that has beige hair and wears Dockers has said that

36
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.420
a million guys like that have said that literally a million, I don't,

37
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.790
I'm not really into his, when he's talking about penis and Serena Williams,

38
00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.100
but you know that in the locker room lyric.

39
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.800
Yeah. But like you don't get to show your in public at all.

40
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:13.660
I'm walking around in the locker room with my hands up. I was like,

41
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:18.450
I'm at a rap show, hands up, put your hands up,

42
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:20.640
put your hands up.

43
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.540
Like you were in the locker room and you ain't got no pants on and crystal it

44
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.670
and put your hands up.

45
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.130
[inaudible] I mean, Sabbat,

46
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:38.490
Sabbat.
