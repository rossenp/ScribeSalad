00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.590
<v 0>Have you been watching? Uh,</v>

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.480
Chernobyl there's one more episode left mini series and I'm hooked

3
00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:09.690
on it, dude. And it's really good. Really good.

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.160
It's it's there's it's sometimes it's a little, you're like, wow,

5
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:15.660
it's a little much with the realism.

6
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:19.020
It's like a K I'm not watching a documentary, right?

7
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.400
You don't need to show a guy.

8
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.870
W I'm literally looking at a guy and he's only teeth and eyeballs,

9
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.150
but it's so good. And it's so gray. They only,

10
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.440
the only color in it is gray.

11
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.540
And nobody's talking in Russian accents, which is super weird to me.

12
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.860
Here's the thing. I love the show. It's great.

13
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.710
And now I'm going to make fun of it. Um,

14
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.160
uh, I heard the guy, the creator, the writer talking about it. He was like,

15
00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:54.090
well, we chose not to do a Russian accent because, uh,

16
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.060
a Russian accent can be really comical. If, if,

17
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.830
if you're not careful and it's like, no, accent is only comical.

18
00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:03.170
If you make a comical dude, if you, they put Russian X,

19
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.290
these guys is face because we're falling off and in the, in the documentary.

20
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.640
And you're like, Oh no, they're shooting the animals. Cause they're radioactive.

21
00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:13.250
And you're like, Oh no, you think because someone's like,

22
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.880
you'll have to shoot the animal. We're going to be like, ah,

23
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.160
no. So they're not talking. Here's the other thing too.

24
00:01:22.161 --> 00:01:24.650
If you're going to abandon them, talking in Russian accent, first of all,

25
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.710
having you speak Russian and make it subtitles. If you were going for realism,

26
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.740
all right. If you're not doing that, you have them speak the Russian accent.

27
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.540
If you're not doing that, okay, then just have them just be

28
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.870
their regular accent or, or, or whatever the. This is an American show. Right?

29
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.550
So, but they're not, some of the guys are Irish. Some of the guys are Swedish.

30
00:01:46.551 --> 00:01:51.440
Some of the guys who are, literally British it, it makes me,

31
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.140
it takes me out of it. For sure. When they're like, when it's like in Russia,

32
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.510
what we're going to do, everyone's faces are fallen off comrade. What?

33
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.180
It's like, I thought guys, literally blood and bones, comrade.

34
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:10.683
You're like, what,

35
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.440
What guys got a third arm growing out of his forehead. Comrade.

36
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.500
I just saw a dog with no snout and an extra deck on his

37
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.090
comrade.

38
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.960
Well, we kind of do, Oh,

39
00:02:35.961 --> 00:02:40.070
I got a night. What's Russia.

40
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.680

43
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.740

44
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.690
Third, one down sweet and sour cabbage.

45
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.870
