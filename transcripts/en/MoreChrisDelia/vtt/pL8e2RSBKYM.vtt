00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.300
<v 0>Yo, do you know that there's, uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.930
speakers that you for? If you're pregnant,

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.040
you could put a speaker in your vagina and play music for the baby.

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.460
That's a thing. That's something. And, and then,

5
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:17.550
and the baby can hear music and just supposed to like calm the baby and stuff

6
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:21.480
like this. And that's a product and doctors are like, Hey,

7
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.170
don't use it idiots. Do you know why?

8
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.300
Because you should never put electronics up inside your. Does,

9
00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:33.090
is that something that needs to be said, Hey,

10
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.770
don't put electronics in your Plessy.

11
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.520
Do you know why electronics?

12
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.130
Imagine that. Just putting a being so dumb that you're like, Oh,

13
00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:47.850
I got to buy that and put music up my.

14
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.380
So my unborn child can listen to Josh Groban.

15
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.490
Imagine, do you turn it on first and then put it in?

16
00:00:56.491 --> 00:00:57.750
Or do you put it in and then turn on it?

17
00:00:57.751 --> 00:01:01.950
How do you even know if it's it's playing? It's just like, it's just like,

18
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.050
I, here we go. Here we go. We'll turn on.

19
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.390
<v 1>You raise me up in this</v>

20
00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:13.280
mountain and then used to get it.

21
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.170
[inaudible] it's kind of funny. Take it out a little bit. [inaudible] up.

22
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.093
<v 0>To it. That's so,</v>

23
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.140
what other in your put you're just in line and Starbucks.

24
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.180
<v 1>What the is that coming from? Is that this top now, but it's muffled.</v>

25
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.590
<v 0>And then that's the commercial. And then the girl looks over and says,</v>

26
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.810
it's my speakers. My son's going to be musical.

27
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.480
Just what's that. Or maybe it's like a, uh,

28
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.070
what's this song or this song. It's probably a.

29
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.653
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

30
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.190
<v 0>Dude, Alvin and the chipmunks, you know?</v>

31
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.650
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

32
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.050
<v 0>Dude. There's speakers. What do you call them? I don't even know.</v>

33
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.670
We got to do that. Why do you listen to this podcast?

34
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.900
Talking about puts his finger.

35
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.420
All there's so many electronics and, baby. What?

36
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.620
Baby pod. It's called you. Stick them in your, in you.

37
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.370
Can you put it baby pod?

38
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.200
Let's look this up baby pod. Oh,

39
00:02:51.201 --> 00:02:55.810
it was on the Ellen show. Come on Ellen. Oh,

40
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.500
baby pod is a device for sharing music with your baby for stimulating baby's

41
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:03.250
development during pregnancy. Hey, you know, what's fine, dude. Not doing that.

42
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.330
You know, it's fine. Just letting your baby gestate in your pacy.

43
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.330
<v 1>Music stimulates the baby before birth. No, it doesn't.</v>

44
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.140
This is a scientific fact. No says who,

45
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.060
but how to convey the musical stimulus in the same way that we cannot hear what

46
00:03:27.061 --> 00:03:30.450
is going on inside the baby cannot hear what is happening outside.

47
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.370
And that's fine. This is also a fact, the soft tissues absorb and scatter sound

48
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.100
only from within.

49
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.270
We can stimulate the baby 3d ultrasound scans demonstrate this

50
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.420
once your child, the baby, the inside the baby don't take dockets.

51
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.410
Okay.

52
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.590
<v 0>It's just like all fast and. Like a horror movie. Only funky.</v>

53
00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.220
<v 1>Folks and encourages a response. The miracle of phonation starts prematurely.</v>

54
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.740
I mean two key to cognitive development. Are you kidding me,

55
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.840
baby sticks out its tongue. Oh wow. And you can't.

56
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.810
<v 0>Sticks out his tongue when the music's on, like it's playing Axl Rose.</v>

57
00:04:12.811 --> 00:04:13.644
The bass is like that.

58
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.193
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

59
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.180
<v 0>Oh my God. Dude.</v>

60
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.640
Imagine being that much of an idiot that you get a baby pod and stick it in your

61
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.200
put and then that too.

62
00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:32.880
You play that. I would get Bluetooth and up and try and try to,

63
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.860
um, hook in and make their baby listen to like this.

64
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.850
<v 1>All of a sudden [inaudible]. That's fine. Wait</v>

65
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.850
 to talk to your child to tell your baby how much you love him and see how he 

66
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.850
reacts. Shut up, dude. What if you could start now, I

67
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:51.683
 got a USB with the umbilical cord. Give your baby a universal stimulus. Send him a message from before birth.

68
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.730
<v 0>Giving your baby a universal stimulus. You know what it is?</v>

69
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.050
<v 1>Life.</v>

70
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.730
<v 0>That's the most universal stimulus, Hugh product.</v>

71
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.310
<v 1>Make sure it reaches your child. I mean, come on, dude. Stimulus.</v>

72
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.120
What if you could start now

73
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.170
give your baby a universal stimulus.

74
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.240
Send him a message from before birth and make sure it reaches your child.

75
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.290
Come on, dude.

76
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.530
<v 0>Dude, they have an instruction.</v>

77
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.140
They have a little thing that they're holding and then it shows the person

78
00:05:49.141 --> 00:05:53.040
inserting it in their vagina. And then it shows a phone opening the,

79
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.860
the music app and then plugging in headphones. Hot.

80
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.100
<v 1>It's a crash dude.</v>

81
00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.700
<v 0>Bluetooth music inside your to your baby.</v>

82
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.440
<v 1>[Inaudible] guys would get this and put it in there. But</v>

83
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.880
talk to your shift.

84
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.710
<v 0>Music is not life. Life is life.</v>

85
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.400
Let the baby just have life and then let it choose what music is.

86
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:44.050
I imagine it was a meat dude. Imagine it was,

87
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.970
I imagine, well, you don't want to mute, but measure a down South in your life.

88
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.833
Ah, put up,

89
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.040
play a Travis Tritt for the little critter and then you put it in your and it's

90
00:06:54.041 --> 00:06:57.310
just like some. And it's just like me. I'm like,

91
00:06:57.311 --> 00:07:00.340
I hate country music. And for nine months,

92
00:07:00.341 --> 00:07:03.700
you're just listening to home. I'm mom on.

93
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:05.043
<v 1>Change.</v>

94
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:12.520
<v 0>You just listened to Travis Tritt. Great day to be alive. You know,</v>

95
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.570
You're just some baby. Come on.

96
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.570
<v 1>[Inaudible] down on my house.</v>

97
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.730
<v 0>And you got to hear that as a baby dude.</v>

98
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.930
Let's look up how to use baby pod. How to use

99
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.000
baby pod. How to use,

100
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.870
okay, here we go. How do you use newborns? Uh, how do you baby?

101
00:07:46.871 --> 00:07:49.480
Moon pod? No, no, no, no, no, no.

102
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.310
You should look up the video or just uh, all right.

103
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:03.670
How to use. Oh, got it. Okay, baby pod.

104
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:09.790
What is B? I'll go to baby pod.com. Don't get this. Okay.

105
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:16.720
Because doctors would obviously not want this. Here we go. Baby.

106
00:08:16.721 --> 00:08:18.910
pod.com. Isn't baby cut.

107
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.420
Maybe pod.com.net

108
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.370
light one fire pod.net.

109
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.430
Uh, it's very easy to start. Oh,

110
00:08:33.431 --> 00:08:37.180
why is it in Spanish for me? Oh, here we go. How to use?

111
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:43.240
It's very easy to start. Get into a comfortable position.

112
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:44.981
Number one,

113
00:08:44.981 --> 00:08:49.960
gently insert the free end of baby pod until it's inside the vagina.

114
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:54.040
Well, obviously you're not going to put the phone in there. The free end,

115
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:59.580
insert the phone part into your. Make sure it's on airplane mode.

116
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:00.720
So you don't get a call

117
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.430
number to connect the Jack plug into your smartphone.

118
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.470
If you want to sh number three,

119
00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:09.930
if you want to share the music your baby is listening to.

120
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.770
There is another audio input on the top of the connector for your headphones.

121
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:16.140
I mean, is it for the baby or what you, you you're like? Well,

122
00:09:16.141 --> 00:09:19.590
I want to listen to number four says selfish, you know,

123
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.970
number four to remove your baby pod, just pull gently on the connection cord or

124
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:30.270
make a, make a bowel movement move that's so

125
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:35.640
absolutely asinine baby pod hygiene

126
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.130
here under it. There is none it's in your policy and that's gross, uh,

127
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.480
recommendations and cautions.

128
00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:45.840
Remember that cleaning baby pod to assure hygiene is essential before and after

129
00:09:45.841 --> 00:09:49.980
each use with baby pod closed, clean the outside of the mild soap and water.

130
00:09:49.981 --> 00:09:54.150
Yeah. Okay. Do not submerge your baby pot under water. I mean,

131
00:09:54.151 --> 00:09:57.210
if you can't submerge it under water, you shouldn't put it in your. Huh?

132
00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:58.403
That's a good,

133
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.030
that's a good rule to clean the inside of your baby pod. Open it.

134
00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:04.500
Clockwise warning. Here's a warning.

135
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.230
Avoid the inside part connected to the cable, getting wet. Oh,

136
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.290
that's a hardly a warning. They got to.

137
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:15.620
Why is it in Spanish here?

138
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.770
Oh, it's made in Mexico. That's how you know it's good.

139
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.340
<v 2>Baby pod, a speaker that's inserted into the vagina,</v>

140
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:28.220
like a tampon and then connected to a music player.

141
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:32.270
A fetus is protected by amniotic fluid, a membrane,

142
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.520
the uterine wall and the vaginal wall.

143
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.950
Distorted audio can pass through these layers by the developers of the baby pod

144
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:44.780
say research shows clear sound to the womb is only possible via the vagina,

145
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:45.680
the button.

146
00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.670
<v 0>So really researchers at baby pod say that,</v>

147
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.260
nah, that's weird that they're researchers of baby pod.

148
00:10:54.261 --> 00:10:57.650
Say that baby pod works say

149
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:00.590
criminals.

150
00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.550
<v 2>Barcelona based designers of the device, the Institute market.</v>

151
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:09.680
<v 0>Oh man. Imagine buying something from Barcelona. For real. That's not food.</v>

152
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:15.290
<v 2>Commands using baby pod after the 16th week and for a maximum recommends using</v>

153
00:11:15.291 --> 00:11:17.270
baby pod. After the 16th week,

154
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:21.920
a maximum of 20 minutes each time we don't want your baby

155
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.840
starting to headbang.

156
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:28.820
Pop volume is 54 decibels users of the device offered

<v 0>V these like animated, like people on the,</v>

159
00:11:35.831 --> 00:11:36.860
on this video, they're not,

160
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.430
they don't even have a real actors doing this because they know like real actors

161
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.550
would be like, what the? What the are we doing? This is horrible.

162
00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:46.550
