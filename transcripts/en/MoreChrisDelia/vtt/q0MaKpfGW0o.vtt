00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.880
<v 0>Did you guys see the influencer about the, that,</v>

2
00:00:03.881 --> 00:00:06.300
that pretended she got in a motorcycle accident and then shot it.

3
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.690
<v 1>Either way. It's bad, either way it's bad.</v>

4
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:11.743
Don't go.

5
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.220
<v 0>Cousin. One time said he didn't want to go to college.</v>

6
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.670
And they obviously had been brewing with between him and his dad.

7
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.070
And my uncle said to him, right when he said he cut him off.

8
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.840
<v 1>Then don't go. Don't go. Don't go, Nick.</v>

9
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.430
Don't go. And it was like, so mad, you know?

10
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.870
Anyway, he went, um, so, uh,

11
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.940
yeah.

12
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.780
<v 0>Influencer is defending her decision to post a photo shoot of her motorcycle</v>

13
00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:43.100
accident on Instagram. Hey.

14
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.760
<v 1>Bye dude. Bye bye.</v>

15
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:49.260
If I will.

16
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.030
<v 0>In an airplane and I was going to do a, uh,</v>

17
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.040
skydive and I wasn't sure, and I was nervous.

18
00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:57.890
And then somebody just pulled that up and showed it to me. I jumped out.

19
00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:00.380
Then I got, it. Who cares if it doesn't open.

20
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.160
She also denied to me that Smartwater featured in one of the professional that,

21
00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:07.610
that the Smartwater featured in one of the professional photo shoots is a brand

22
00:01:07.611 --> 00:01:08.444
endorsement.

23
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.740
<v 1>He's a dude. Me. So she put.</v>

24
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.340
<v 0>This was on Buzzfeed. I mean, a lot of people picked it up. I tweeted about it.</v>

25
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.430
I said, how influencers suck, dude, just get a job, man.

26
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.330
<v 1>You know what? Don't get a job. Don't get a job.</v>

27
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.020
Develop, actually develop period, get up, get up a

28
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.970
skill, develop a skill, dude.

29
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.610
Don't just sit near a, you know,

30
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.970
umbrella. And then,

31
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.150
and then have some dude take a picture.

32
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.910
You see these dudes take the pictures, all.

33
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.910
<v 0>Squatted out with their, with their hands, like.</v>

34
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.850
<v 1>All. This is me. This is what this girl says. [inaudible].</v>

35
00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.953
<v 0>Or something.</v>

36
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.230
This is me and my bike about an hour before I got into an accident.

37
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.290
And if you watch my story Sunday, you know all about it. But if you didn't,

38
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.350
here's the scary, magical series of events.

39
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.850
A few of us wrote down to Lee Leaper's fork Saturday to explore and take

40
00:02:13.851 --> 00:02:16.790
pictures. Yeah, you didn't go to explore. You went to go take pictures.

41
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.840
My sweet friend, yada yada was shooting and my other sweet friend,

42
00:02:20.841 --> 00:02:24.110
yada yada was riding while a friend of Lindsay's drove the Jeep. All right,

43
00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:26.930
dude. You know, we don't need all this. Okay, cool. What is this?

44
00:02:26.931 --> 00:02:30.590
The describing back into the left, back into the left.

45
00:02:30.591 --> 00:02:35.150
This is like the JFK trial. So then she was driving and then the,

46
00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:36.680
and then the other sweet friend was riding.

47
00:02:36.681 --> 00:02:39.260
And then while Lindsay drove the dream Jeep, we don't give a.

48
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.690
We played around for a couple hours before heading back up to Nashville

49
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.690
course, course they were going back to Nashville

50
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.140
and uh, around seven 30 and on a secluded two lane stretch,

51
00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:57.770
I misjudged a curve, took a too fast and my bike went off the road.

52
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.490
It slid to the grass and I hit the pavement. I had my helmet on,

53
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.860
so my head was fine, but I yada yada. Yeah.

54
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.380
<v 1>And then in the.</v>

55
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.870
<v 0>The whole time I was listening to the main attraction. That's what she said.</v>

56
00:03:12.871 --> 00:03:15.900
Exactly word for word. And um, so.

57
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.150
<v 1>Uh, this.</v>

58
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.180
<v 0>Was so she did the thing made the tweet,</v>

59
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.570
made the Instagram and then like

60
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.910
they got pictures.

61
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.590
<v 1>Of her w like.</v>

62
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.230
<v 0>In pain on the ground and this photographer was just taking pictures of it and</v>

63
00:03:34.231 --> 00:03:37.530
then posted it and filtered it out.

64
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.510
And it all fits the aesthetic on our Instagram.

65
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.470
<v 1>Okay. Ooh.</v>

66
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.960
<v 0>You did the wrong thing. Bay Bay.</v>

67
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.260
<v 1>Dude, this is just so bad.</v>

68
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.320
<v 0>Yes. If she says the word event, adventure in the caption too,</v>

69
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.790
everything's a adventure dude. To these checks,

70
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.670
everything is a adventure. They could lay in bed and be like today.

71
00:04:11.671 --> 00:04:14.730
I just didn't. I just adventured with my pillow.

72
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.520
I just adventured watching the hostel, the hostel trilogy. Ooh,

73
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.190
scary. I need to go on an adventure like that.

74
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.690
Only without the rape and getting killed. LOL.

75
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.880
My friend was there to take her.

76
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.753
<v 1>Pictures.</v>

77
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.560
<v 0>This, these aesthetics too, uh, that they have are all like,</v>

78
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.350
always like Brown and tan these days.

79
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.810
<v 1>It's crazy, dude. It's so crazy to me,</v>

80
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.120
the world. And that's it.

81
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.670
How many, what? I'll follow up post? Uh,

82
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.650
she's sitting on her bike. Cool. All.

83
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.820
<v 0>And that Smartwater was all placed in the earlier one, too.</v>

84
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.440
This is a follow-up post. Cool.

85
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.530
I've been figuring out how to respond to everything that's unfolded recently

86
00:05:10.531 --> 00:05:14.340
regarding the post I shared three weeks ago about my Modo accident at shortened

87
00:05:14.341 --> 00:05:16.560
it, I won't get into the post here.

88
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.930
See my Moto accident story for highlighted for all the details.

89
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.240
S still promoting her accident.

90
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.780
Didn't learn all good keeps touching the hot stove,

91
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.260
but I want to talk about the reactions I've been getting to the article at

92
00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:30.300
Buzzfeed news, posted sensationalizing.

93
00:05:30.301 --> 00:05:32.730
What I went through that day and making a mockery of the post I shared.

94
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.420
<v 1>Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh dude.</v>

95
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.600
<v 0>I don't say this word a lot, but sweet.</v>

96
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.553
<v 1>It's hard.</v>

97
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.880
<v 0>You were the one making a mockery of your accident when you put</v>

98
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.290
gradient.

99
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.300
<v 1>Is that the right way to say that? Who gives a dude?</v>

100
00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.080
<v 0>When you, when you adjusted the gradient, is that how you say it?</v>

101
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.640
I don't know when you opened the aperture. No.

102
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:08.540
Nothing about it. I've been accused of state as a result.

103
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:11.300
I've been accused of staging the accident to get attention.

104
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.700
Do you know why you cue you're accused? You know.

105
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.440
<v 2>Why you were accused of that OJ?</v>

106
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:20.403
<v 1>Um.</v>

107
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.740
<v 0>Using it as a product placement opportunity with a water company.</v>

108
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.280
I also don't get that part. I don't give a flying about,

109
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.510
I don't care about that. We're all suckers and kudos for drinking the. Anyway.

110
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.670
Who cares if they post it with an, with a fake accent?

111
00:06:34.671 --> 00:06:37.600
I don't give a Smartwater. I mean, I drink it. I mean, I mean.

112
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.350
<v 1>Can use that for a smart water ad.</v>

113
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.960
<v 0>More water. I drink it. I don't give a.</v>

114
00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.480
She crashed and put a Smartwater on the photo. I don't give a.

115
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.690
I'll take a shower in it. Give me more, put it up above my.

116
00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:51.760
I'll take an outdoor shower with it.

117
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.060
I'll open up my mouth and just drink it while I wash my armpits with it. I E.

118
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:04.383
<v 1>Um.</v>

119
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:09.130
<v 0>I've been using his approximate water company and other things I can't even wrap</v>

120
00:07:09.131 --> 00:07:12.220
my head around. Well, we wrapped our heads around it for you.

121
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.340
I've been sharing real life stories here. Since I started my account,

122
00:07:15.341 --> 00:07:17.440
I've opened up about miscarriage, divorce, anxiety,

123
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.720
losing my partner in a motor accident three years ago,

124
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:23.650
and navigating grief that followed I've chosen to use Instagram as a tool for

125
00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:26.530
healing and connecting with other humans who may be going through similar things

126
00:07:26.531 --> 00:07:30.580
so we can do it together. And it's been beautiful when I work with brands,

127
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.610
they're ones I personally enjoy. And I just go to every single sponsorship,

128
00:07:33.611 --> 00:07:36.790
accusing someone of faking or exploiting the accident is extremely serious

129
00:07:36.791 --> 00:07:38.590
because of because what if you're wrong?

130
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.660
<v 1>I really, it.</v>

131
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.280
<v 0>Really happened to me and I was scared.</v>

132
00:07:42.281 --> 00:07:43.930
I really was injured and I had to recover.

133
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.000
I was in chocolate and on the side of the road, having flashbacks,

134
00:07:46.001 --> 00:07:48.700
when I lost someone, very important to me, friends were on my side. Look,

135
00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:52.000
I don't even give a. If the really happened and the really happened.

136
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:54.910
What's what, what's the difference between us. It starts with the penis,

137
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.790
but if the really happened, that's fine. The problem,

138
00:07:57.791 --> 00:08:02.500
I don't have the problem I have isn't with the fact that I

139
00:08:02.501 --> 00:08:05.110
think it's a fake motorcycle accident.

140
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:10.210
<v 2>As a matter of fact, that's better.</v>

141
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.090
That's better than falling on the ground in a real way,

142
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:20.950
scraping the out of your tattooed shoulder and asking your

143
00:08:20.951 --> 00:08:23.200
friend to take photos about it.

144
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:27.760
Because that's the way that we know he got mental

145
00:08:27.761 --> 00:08:28.594
problems,

146
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.090
Staging. It is at least for the money,

147
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:42.910
But you falling down, hurting yourself,

148
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:47.800
having flashbacks from losing your partner to the same

149
00:08:47.801 --> 00:08:52.420
accident and asking your friend to take

150
00:08:52.421 --> 00:08:56.910
Grady and shots mean she got

151
00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:58.800
mad props.

152
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:04.430
<v 1>Yeah, I understand. Oh,</v>

153
00:09:04.431 --> 00:09:05.840
but it's tan.

154
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.350
<v 2>It's all good. Yeah. Brains. All Dan Ted.</v>

155
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.500
<v 1>Dude. That's.</v>

156
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.690
<v 2>The hugest problem of it. All.</v>

157
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.750
I crashed. Get out your camera.

158
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.210
That's not a sentence that you say,

159
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.810
Why are you acting like the not problem is the problem.

160
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.680
The only problem is the real problem. Dude.

161
00:09:39.681 --> 00:09:43.550
I want to have a game show called the real problem. People come up and be like,

162
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:48.710
