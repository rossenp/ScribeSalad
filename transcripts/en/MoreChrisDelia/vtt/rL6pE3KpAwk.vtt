00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.610
<v 0>So guys it's time for the most up Instagram posts of</v>

2
00:00:05.611 --> 00:00:06.444
the week.

3
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.020
Oh, I forgot about that.

4
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.740
This one's great. Uh, actually,

5
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.050
it's very kind of weird and

6
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.580
someone sent this to me. I'm not going to say the name, obviously,

7
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.020
cause I don't want to out her. I just, this,

8
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.410
I haven't done fo most up Instagram posted a week and a long time.

9
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.470
I am bringing it back because of this one. This is how crazy this one is. Okay.

10
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.590
A girl's on a Vesper almost. You guessed it showing her.

11
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.020
Cause the skirts coming up, if it was up an inch higher,

12
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.120
you'd see her back door hole. Okay.

13
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.980
And that's a serious thing here. So she says,

14
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.520
apparently she just got 1 million followers. All right.

15
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.960
That's what she's saying. 1 million of you right now.

16
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.940
I'm looking back on this time. Last year.

17
00:01:16.941 --> 00:01:20.690
When I used to write in my little work notebook, quote,

18
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.940
1 million followers on Instagram,

19
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.180
I would trace that over and over while Incapsula here.

20
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.630
Literally crying because I wanted it so bad.

21
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.190
Now let's just take a second to imagine

22
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.660
a 20 year old girl in a coffee shop

23
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.320
tracing over 1 million followers

24
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.760
crying. Hey,

25
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.250
go home. Hey,

26
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.920
why do you have a

27
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.120
pencil period?

28
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.940
You know here either. This is true.

29
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.460
And you are literally Jeffrey

30
00:02:13.461 --> 00:02:18.410
Dahmer, only a serial killer traces words over and over again.

31
00:02:18.411 --> 00:02:23.300
You know that nobody has ever even traced over

32
00:02:23.301 --> 00:02:28.100
more than one letter that hasn't killed someone straight up. Okay.

33
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.870
Try it, try it at home.

34
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.010
Go right with some random word automobile and then trace over it.

35
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.080
You've off you get this insane urge. Overwhelming urge this blood lust. Okay.

36
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.670
And this girl is sitting there 1 million followers over and so

37
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.900
also crying doing it.

38
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.790
Hey, your dad died early.

39
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.850
So you got probs. All right.

40
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.850
But she's happy. She's got a million being happy to get. Look. That's great.

41
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.270
Okay. So crying because I wanted it so bad.

42
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.020
I can't even express how grateful I am to have so much love and support from all

43
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:15.280
of you. Well, that's honky, Dory. Nobody gives a.

44
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.110
That's for sure.

45
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.790
If you think your followers are honestly supporting you and loving you,

46
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.470
Hey, go home,

47
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.310
go on a retreat somewhere. Okay?

48
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.610
I want you guys to know that if it just gets better and better,

49
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.400
I want you guys to know that if you have a dream,

50
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.350
heck don't ever let someone tell you that you can't do it. By the way,

51
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.100
what thinks that a hot girl can't get 1 million followers.

52
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.340
I'm surprised that all girls don't have 1 million followers.

53
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.200
I'm surprised there isn't a girl that looks like that guy from the Goonies,

54
00:04:01.201 --> 00:04:03.960
with the bent ear, that doesn't have a hundred that has a million followers.

55
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.840
Because if you're a girl, you can get as many followers as you want.

56
00:04:06.841 --> 00:04:08.070
If you're showing your back door,

57
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.350
all you gotta do is open up your back door and follow her.

58
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.120
So why

59
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.440
fo inspirational. Why wouldn't you don't ever listen.

60
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.440
I want to tell you that you can't do it. Why wouldn't you be able to? Well,

61
00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:38.700
I don't know. I mean actually, you know what the answer to that is?

62
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.640
Tons of reasons there are. Yeah.

63
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.190
Why can't you do the thing you want to do? Well,

64
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.460
it's like the, the lady at church grits, potatoes mash, BAMS pants.

65
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.410
You can just do a big song about it.

66
00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.150
Why can't you do the thing you want to graze potatoes, mass, mass camps.

67
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.070
But with just like family money, buggin stress, anxiety disorders,

68
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.200
kids pass fast.

69
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.230
Why can't you do it? No talent, family, stress kids,

70
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.160
you know, anxiety. Um,

71
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.110
why wouldn't you be able to, you are the only one stopping yourself.

72
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.040
Oh yeah. Cops,

73
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.460
family, kids, France. People pretend the lack of they don't.

74
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.100
Um, for all we know, this is our only life.

75
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.530
So why would you ever let someone else's words and perspective stop you from

76
00:05:49.531 --> 00:05:54.090
being happy and doing what you're drawn to do in the end. It's you?

77
00:05:54.091 --> 00:05:57.120
And it's your life. You're stuck with yourself.

78
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.650
You die so long story short.

79
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.970
Do what makes you happy and thank you all so,

80
00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:08.480
so much for being with me on this journey. I love you.

81
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.730
There's no journey, dude.

82
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.860
You're in a leopard print dress showing your.

83
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.990
That's not a journey. Everyone thinks they're on a journey. You know?

84
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.430
Oh, you know, it's the juror. It's um, the jury, you know, people don't,

85
00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.050
it's not about the end result. It's about the journey then.

86
00:06:32.051 --> 00:06:36.670
Why is everyone always a busted nut? Huh? Who does that?

87
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.850
Who? Doesn't bust a nut. Who does that?

88
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.540
Weird.

89
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.110
It's about the journey. You know,

90
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.530
it's not about particularly getting to where you're going.

91
00:06:53.531 --> 00:06:55.630
It's about what you learn about. All right.

92
00:06:55.631 --> 00:06:58.930
Sensei red belt on the outta here.

93
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.010
tans, clamps, BAMS, dude. This chick just no clue.

94
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.740
Here's the thing too is a young woman. She's 20 or something.

95
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.360
Or even if she's 19 or 1800. Okay.

96
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:21.220
It's tough because you gotta, you got to understand that

97
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.090
this is not sustainable.

98
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.880
You're going to the second you turned 35 immediate tears

99
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.850
because guys, aren't going to be paying attention to it in that way.

100
00:07:33.851 --> 00:07:37.030
Like they used to, it's a sad truth.

101
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:39.610
But um, it's true.

102
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:48.220
Why wouldn't someone? Why wouldn't someone? Why wouldn't you be able to family,

103
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.490
kids, anxiety, age disease.

104
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.750
I just, you know,

105
00:07:58.751 --> 00:08:02.560
what's crazy is we don't know the long-terms effect of social media.

106
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:08.020
Like that woman is going to be 51 day.

107
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:15.490
That's how she grew up. When she was 12. Instagram was the thing. This is,

108
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:20.170
she thinks these followers love her dude.

109
00:08:20.171 --> 00:08:22.360
Have you ever heard Snoop dog?

110
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:28.240
When I love these hoes, I'm out the dough.

111
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:33.400
They don't love you. Listen to Snoop dog, dude.

112
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.820
We don't learn them. How is the at the dough? Hey dude,

113
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.680
you think your followers love you for posting your rump.

114
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.320
Have you ever heard this?

115
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.080
[inaudible] act like y'all know. It's the abominable whole man

116
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.250
international post. Hey Dick dope.

117
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.860
<v 1>Man. I have you ever heard of him?</v>

118
00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.580
<v 0>Of the neighbor, Dick dope, man.</v>

119
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.680
They don't love you. They squirt TIAA.

120
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:14.090
I mean do it. It's just unreal. What's up with the parents, man.

121
00:09:14.091 --> 00:09:18.800
Get involved here, dude.

122
00:09:18.801 --> 00:09:21.830
If I have a daughter and she's posting her rump on Instagram,

123
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:26.240
guess what's happening. Guess what's happening.

124
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.140
I am a locking her in a room for a week straight.

125
00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:34.100
All she's eaten is you potatoes man pants.

126
00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.350
And this is what she's listening to over and over again.

127
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:41.870
<v 1>Two Oh two that's in small cities and States. Oh matter of fact,</v>

128
00:09:41.871 --> 00:09:45.070
three Oh five. We can meet outside.

129
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.260
Control your hormones and keep your drawers on. So.

<v 0>Creative. We control the hormones and traits the or doors,</v>

131
00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.950
area, area code.

132
00:09:57.951 --> 00:10:01.280
Why did ludicrous always dress like Gilligan?

133
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:07.160
Dude. Ludicrous is Gilligan from Gilligan's Island. Dude,

134
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.490
man TV shows used to be lit, huh? Gillig.

135
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.880
I used to watch it with my grandma Gilligan's Island.

136
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.010
Oh the minimum from phone. But I'm pumped from minimum.

137
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:24.800
Just chick showing her, rubbing him nothing.

138
00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:35.990
<v 1>[Inaudible] imagine these guys singing this and then directly getting all the.</v>

139
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.700
[inaudible] beat the living out of them. And they're like, what the?

140
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:50.150
And the kind of they're trying to block it. But the punch goes through the face,

141
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.240
through the hand and smacks in the face. The show bloody.

142
00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.900
Get your kicked to the song

143
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.590

<v 0>Sucks.</v>

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:10.070
That's worth way worse than control your hormones and eat some hor

00:11:10.071 --> 00:11:13.640
d'oeuvres God, that song sucks.

147
