00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.311
<v 0>Dude, you know what?</v>

2
00:00:02.311 --> 00:00:06.150
I've been getting a bunch of texts and and people telling me how Kuda this is.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.880
A lot of times people don't understand what real Kuda is.

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.750
They just call people Kuda because they don't know what the term is. We,

5
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.650
we coined the term Kuda here. It's from Barracuda. And you're a Kuda.

6
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.280
If you do something, just because you see it and someone else maybe says,

7
00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:22.110
it's a good idea. And you're like, what's that? Oh, cool. I'll do it.

8
00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:25.380
Like a Barracuda sees a diamond bracelet and then looks at it and says,

9
00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:29.490
what's that Coachella number one, a thing here is a super Kuda.

10
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.990
Okay. By the way, was the timer here?

11
00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:36.210
I don't even see how long we want to right there. Okay. Um,

12
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.830
these people there's like an,

13
00:00:38.831 --> 00:00:41.190
a climbing Mount Everest is like at an all time high.

14
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.520
And it's because of Instagram because they want to get this picture at the

15
00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:48.060
summit. At the top of the mountain. And people are dying.

16
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.020
Didn't 11 people die this year. 11 people died this year too many.

17
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.890
And it looks like a traffic jam.

18
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.820
It looks like it would be in a like fish market in China.

19
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.560
Like how long the line is for people trying to get up to this summit, dude,

20
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.310
it was like a zoo. This person says death on an unruly overcrowded Everest.

21
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.220
This picture, a long line of climbers waiting to summit,

22
00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:20.960
Mount Everest on May 22nd, dude, this is a nightmare.

23
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.730
I don't want to be in Hawaii and align like this.

24
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.230
And they're on a mountain on a high one. They can't breathe.

25
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.620
Their lips are chapped. They're in North face gear.

26
00:01:33.621 --> 00:01:36.920
At least they're keeping warm in their North face gear.

27
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.000
But dude, they've got packs on their backs, the grandparents on the barracks.

28
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.280
And then they're like getting their cameras like these asses with their cameras.

29
00:01:49.281 --> 00:01:51.470
Ready? Just almost dying.

30
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.020
Look at this. Hi mom. Love you.

31
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.890
And that was the last note. Her mom, his mom, her mom ever seen you.

32
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.440
Can't tell if it's a man or a woman because he's covered up so much because it's

33
00:02:03.441 --> 00:02:06.380
way too cold. And if he takes anything off or she takes anything off,

34
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.600
she'll she, he will immediately get frostbite.

35
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:09.763
<v 1>And died.</v>

36
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.880
<v 0>Let's go up a little bit. There was just a quote, a little bit more there.</v>

37
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.060
I was not prepared to see sick climbers being dragged down the mountain by

38
00:02:17.061 --> 00:02:21.110
Sherpas or surreal or the surreal experience of finding dead bodies. He said,

39
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.910
well really? Hey, I've got it. I've got it. Hey dude. That's crazy, man. Well,

40
00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:28.700
you know what? You're a bonafide idiot.

41
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.490
You didn't expect to see sick people or dead bodies at the top of Mount

42
00:02:34.491 --> 00:02:38.990
Everest. Well, dude, this Justin do-do dude,

43
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.630
you're a bonehead moron.

44
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.130
[inaudible] this just in your, a bone head.

45
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.450
You didn't expect to see dead bodies where there are dead bodies

46
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.333
hat.

47
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.640
<v 1>Why.</v>

48
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.250
<v 0>Can't do a drive by here? Cause you're on the top of Mount Everest.</v>

49
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:04.703
<v 1>But this</v>

50
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.230
hat, uh, climbed by hat.

51
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.320
<v 0>People with photos or, I mean.</v>

52
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.020
<v 1>I don't know, whatever it is,</v>

53
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.320
people always want the picture.

54
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.980
<v 0>People sometimes want pictures of me. They don't even know who I am.</v>

55
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.860
They just saw somebody take a picture of me. They're like, can I get a picture?

56
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.130
I go like this. Who am I? And they go like this ruin entourage.

57
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.340
And I go, I go real slowly.

58
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.060
<v 1>Oh, picture for a year.</v>

59
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.010
<v 0>To this theme of gangstas paradise. What if I was that much of a lunatic?</v>

60
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.500
I got to get there, dude. I swear to God. I got to get there.

61
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.610
That's my dream to be like a guy that just,

62
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.210
I wish I didn't like part of me wishes. I didn't have a conscious,

63
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.700
conscious conscience conscience.

64
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.350
I was up like on my opener conscience. If somebody goes like this,

65
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.170
can I have a picture? Who am I? Oh, I don't know your name,

66
00:04:25.171 --> 00:04:27.900
but I think I saw you on Netflix and I just go.

67
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.900
<v 1>Oh</v>

68
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.890
[inaudible] then, then, then, then, then, then.

69
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.881
<v 0>Then,</v>

70
00:04:44.881 --> 00:04:48.390
and I just keep doing that until they get so weird and awkward and walk away.

71
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.380
So that's how it's going to be

72
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.110
throw right. And one wildfires face didn't mean to that.

73
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.940
That's the way the cookie crumbles. And I'm very sorry, but you know, I threw,

74
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.410
I meant to throw it at the, uh,

75
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.350
camera went right in one fire's face.

76
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.280
And now let me tell you something also what's super annoying. You know,

77
00:05:11.281 --> 00:05:13.590
when people go, how about dude,

78
00:05:13.591 --> 00:05:16.290
when you were like in high school or some or not even high school,

79
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.950
but you throw, uh, uh, uh, uh,

80
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.160
trash away and you try to make it in the bin. And then they go like this. Wow.

81
00:05:23.161 --> 00:05:25.800
And you played basketball and you play basketball and you miss.

82
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.100
Why don't you play basketball? It's nothing like it. Okay. Case closed.

83
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.660
That's it. And I'm not talking about that anymore.

84
00:05:30.661 --> 00:05:34.440
And we're not doing that anymore. Nobody does it. You're a straight up.

85
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.020
If you do that, if somebody tries to throw some away and they go see,

86
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.510
they isn't like, wow, you'd be able, terrible basketball player or Oh, you go,

87
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.280
Oh, you play basketball. Well, that's the weird,

88
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.860
you couldn't even make that yo case close. We're not talking about it anymore.

89
00:05:43.861 --> 00:05:46.200
We're not doing that. And I'm not. I'm done talking about it. That's it?

90
00:05:46.201 --> 00:05:47.034
Case closed.

91
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.770
<v 1>There's rules, my babies. And if you don't think there's rules,</v>

92
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.670
you're part of the problem.

93
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.910
<v 0>I just need to get this caught.</v>

94
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.410
I need to get this coat going and I need to get this log cabin going.

95
00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:04.220
I need builders. I need carpenters. And I need weed whackers.

96
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.790
That's for starters, I need people to go down and whack the weeds,

97
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:11.150
find the place where we're going to put it builders to do it in carpenters to

98
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:14.810
lay the down. And then after that, I'm going to need some food people.

99
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.950
And you know, some and suckers dude,

100
00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:20.900
because we got a bus nuts when we're at the log cabin.

101
00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:23.870
Don't you understand don't you understand

102
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.470
let's play a little bit of that song.

103
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.970
This is what we do, baby. Is that even how it goes?

104
00:06:34.971 --> 00:06:37.400
It's probably so different. I thought I remembered it.

105
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.960
It's probably so different.

106
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.350
<v 1>Wow. So nineties.</v>

107
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:54.123
<v 0>Nineties.</v>

108
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.983
<v 1>There it is.</v>

109
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:14.643
[inaudible] wow.

110
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.640
<v 0>She dreams in digital. Anyway,</v>

111
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.240
thanks 4g for that song in the law, in the world.

112
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.210
And so this girl is digital.

113
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:30.190
She's a fake chick that somebody just creates and she's called

114
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.570
lo McKayla. It sounds like could be a SoundCloud rapper.

115
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:38.703
<v 1>Um.</v>

116
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:40.863
<v 0>Anyway,</v>

117
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:46.240
this chick is a fake girl that somebody created and

118
00:07:46.241 --> 00:07:50.320
it has the same amount of followers as I have the, dude,

119
00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:53.710
I work hard. I tour the country.

120
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:58.690
I come out with content and this chick is just fake with a fake

121
00:07:58.691 --> 00:08:03.250
hat and people follow her. Look at this.

122
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:08.110
She's the, by a pool, in a bathing suit with a hat, holding the hat.

123
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.500
And she says, I have so many things I'm supposed to be doing right now,

124
00:08:11.501 --> 00:08:16.480
but I'm not doing any of it. And wishing I was sitting at this pool instead. No,

125
00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:21.040
Hey, you don't have anything you're supposed to be doing.

126
00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.470
You're not real.

127
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.670
And somebody wrote rule breaker.

128
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.820
She's not a rule breaker, dude.

129
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.260
She doesn't, she doesn't

130
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:48.170
break or follow rules. You know why she

131
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.153
[inaudible].

132
00:08:58.410 --> 00:08:59.243
<v 1>[Inaudible]. That's why dude. That's why. That's why she's not fricking rules.</v>

133
00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.080
<v 0>I mean, dude, here's a, let me look at some of our other posts, by the way,</v>

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:26.870
Can't find it. Can't find it.

Think I'm ready to let my hair down again. Maybe.

00:10:34.971 --> 00:10:36.200

And somebody writes you're a lesbian. I'm shook.
