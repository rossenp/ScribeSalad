00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.360
<v 0>You know, you know, I never thought I'd go to war with a city.</v>

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.190
I never thought I'd go to war with the city, but I'm at war with the city, baby.

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.890
I talked about Albuquerque on Twitter and they,

4
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.550
and then I, and guess what? Now they, and dude,

5
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.503
they're back.

6
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.250
<v 1>Social media is shedding more light on his comment.</v>

7
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.350
Chris Delia performed earlier.

8
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.980
<v 0>Dude, another segment,</v>

9
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.490
another segment,

10
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.130
two segments, two segments, too many.

11
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.740
I'm a correspondent at this point,

12
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.480
dude, they came back and did another segment. Last episode,

13
00:00:50.481 --> 00:00:53.900
I talked about Albuquerque and they did a segment on me about how I quote

14
00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:56.300
unquote bash them and this

15
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.050
afterwards, they said my name right in the first one shade.

16
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.750
They didn't say it right in the second one. You know what it is?

17
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.960
<v 1>Social media is shedding more light on his comment.</v>

18
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.490
Chris Delia performed earlier this month at the chemo theater afterwards,

19
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.720
he took to Twitter saying, quote, I've been to some blank holes, but Holy blank,

20
00:01:20.721 --> 00:01:22.520
you make Jacksonville look like paradise.

21
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.150
Many new Mexicans criticized him on social media. Well,

22
00:01:26.151 --> 00:01:30.320
a couple of days after our story aired, Sally responded to the outcry saying,

23
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.570
couldn't believe the response.

24
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.440
<v 0>I was there for eight hours in my podcast on their news segment, Weiss.</v>

25
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.420
I'm sure it's fine.

26
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.060
How could you get upset about somebody saying something.

27
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.950
<v 1>What's that now he still hasn't revealed an exact reason for not liking</v>

28
00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:54.230
Albuquerque, but he did poke fun at chemo.

29
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.630
Theater's name does the best part and said our buildings are short Albuquerque,

30
00:01:59.631 --> 00:02:04.070
but he did poke fun at chemo theater's name and said, our buildings are short.

31
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.440
<v 0>Dude. The newscaster said that,</v>

32
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.500
ah,

33
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.790
food, the newscaster said,

34
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.930
I said that the buildings are short. I said,

35
00:02:20.931 --> 00:02:25.760
you have to crouch down into him, dude, what the,

36
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.300
man? Hey man,

37
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.320
by the way, there was another child shot.

38
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.680
By the way, there was a murder. They murdered 70 people in Albuquerque.

39
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.320
Unbelievable dude,

40
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.160
pro Albuquerque turned out to be my favorite city in the U S dude,

41
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.660
just because of their, they clap back. They have a clap back effect.

42
00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.100
I told my buddy about this and he was saying that, uh, you know,

43
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:03.790
cause Aaron Paul shot our Aaron's a buddy of mine from a breaking bad.

44
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.720
And that Aaron Paul shot, uh, they shot breaking bad,

45
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.290
breaking bad over in Albuquerque. And the reason why, you know,

46
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:13.450
that is because anytime you step foot in Albuquerque,

47
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.690
everything about breaking bad is plastered all over.

48
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.350
So, uh, did,

49
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:23.920
he said something about Albuquerque that wasn't favorable one time and they made

50
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:25.960
a whole segment about him. So it made me feel less special.

51
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:29.350
So that's that's okay. That's okay. That's okay.

52
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.400
But they make it a big deal about it. And that's hilarious to me, dude.

53
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.380
So Albuquerque shout out to you, dude.

54
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.590
You're becoming my favorite city in the U S just because of the segments, man,

55
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.820
this just in about Albuquerque, uh,

56
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.380
James Woods is shooting a movie here and he just said it was too cold.

57
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.900
We check into some locals here to see about how they feel about James Woods

58
00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:59.070
saying that it's too cold. I don't know. I mean, you know, it's just,

59
00:03:59.071 --> 00:04:02.850
it's it's it depends really what, what, um, when you come,

60
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.300
the seasons are different and obviously it's going to be colder in January and

61
00:04:06.301 --> 00:04:09.750
February than it is going to be in, um, July,

62
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.480
you know, maybe if you came in the summer, uh, it would have been, um,

63
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.010
it would have been warmer, but you know,

64
00:04:17.011 --> 00:04:20.940
if he's going to come during the winter, uh, obviously it's going to be, uh,

65
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.720
colder. So I don't know, maybe they should shoot movies in the store.

66
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.270
James Woods was not available for comment,

67
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.000
but he's took to Twitter bashing liberals.

68
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.000
Um, so yeah, dude, anyway, I I'm, I, you know,

69
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.700
loving it. I don't know whatever they,

70
00:04:45.701 --> 00:04:47.490
they mispronounced my name on the second segment,

71
00:04:47.491 --> 00:04:51.360
but on the first segment that got it right. Hey, Hey, Albuquerque.

72
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:53.700
Um, so whatever.
