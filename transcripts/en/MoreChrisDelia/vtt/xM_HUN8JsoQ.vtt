1
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.700
<v 0>And I mean, I'm busting out of my shirt. I mean, yeah. My leg,</v>

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.470
my legs look like, my shoes look like olives on toothpicks, but still dude.

3
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.383
<v 1>Bustin.</v>

4
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.230
<v 2>You understand traps, delts,</v>

5
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.570
you name it chest. Abs. I swear to God.

6
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.570
<v 0>One time I looked really closely to my eyes. It was a little guy skiing down.</v>

7
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.270
I didn't even know they made people that little, but they did.

8
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.440
Jesus made a guy that little and he was skiing down my abs and I just let them

9
00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:36.360
go right down to my deck. Um,

10
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.590
and then just did one of those long jumps off the deck. You know how they do.

11
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.290
He went down some moguls off of my abs,

12
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.030
my little Hawaiian dinner rolls and then boom went down,

13
00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:50.430
sloped off the shaft of my Dick. And when.

14
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.370
<v 1>He.</v>

15
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.650
<v 0>So that's the kind of life I'm leading. Uh,</v>

16
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.940
and then, uh, but that's it.

17
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.910
Now one fire just played something off his computer.

18
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.020
It went loud off the speakers, one fire. And that is why he's one fire.

19
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.240
And that's fine if I, yes, the bags are my.

20
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.570
<v 3>Eyes. Yes. Would I have to check them at the airport? Yes.</v>

21
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.980
Could I put them in the overhead bin? No.

22
00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:22.500
Would they make me tag them while I was working before I put them into the

23
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:25.020
airplane? Yes. Is it okay? Yes. Does it matter? Do.

24
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.640
<v 0>Comedy doesn't really matter. Okay.</v>

25
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.110
<v 2>But it's all good. How.</v>

26
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.710
<v 0>About the long jumping skiing though? For real? Like what are you doing?</v>

27
00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:38.790
That's some that should've just stopped in the fifties when they were like,

28
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:39.630
this is exciting.

29
00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:44.520
Did he say you jumped so long and it's so far some of these Olympics events.

30
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.680
It's like what? Hey, what.

31
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.560
<v 2>The louche Hey dude,</v>

32
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.240
any.

33
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.880
<v 0>Event that you can literally clip your nails while you're doing it,</v>

34
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.630
take it out of the Olympics. Also.

35
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.730
ShotPut just throwing a ball hat, make it more interesting.

36
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.050
Make it more intricate.

37
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.700
<v 2>Hey dude. Oh, shot put. Oh, but you know what?</v>

38
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.290
There's a basketball. Hey,

39
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.660
what's the one, the javelin, our really there's football.

40
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.270
<v 0>Guy, just running submits to cause he's always hopping, you know? Oh,</v>

41
00:02:27.271 --> 00:02:32.250
it's so funny how they hop. So or they throw that though. That's,

42
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.020
who cares? You know, I love how people are like, oh, I love the Olympics.

43
00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:38.910
When the Olympics come out, nobody, here's how, you know,

44
00:02:38.911 --> 00:02:40.830
people don't give a about the Olympics. For real.

45
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.200
Nobody talks about the Olympics when the Olympics aren't happening.

46
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.130
That's how you know. And people are like, nah, I just love to. I love it.

47
00:02:47.131 --> 00:02:51.200
I love to watch one fire, pretends to love it, dude. He, and, and,

48
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.460
and when you never hear about it,

49
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.200
when people aren't swimming or throwing ice picks, you never think about it.

50
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.130
Nobody ever talks about it. Unless somebody got their shot, put like this,

51
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.140
like they're trying to get serviced in the jungle and twisting around and then

52
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:08.974
throwing it.

53
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.590
People get people talking about basketball all year long people talking about

54
00:03:13.591 --> 00:03:16.780
baseball all year long. People talk about football all year long. You.

55
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.930
<v 2>Know what people don't talk about all year long, the.</v>

56
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.440
<v 0>Pommel horse or whatever the hell it's called.</v>

57
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.930
Guys just swinging around, swinging around.

58
00:03:28.931 --> 00:03:33.270
You know that when they do the pommel horse, you know, they're going okay.

59
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.770
<v 1>Also, what are you wearing?</v>

60
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.760
<v 2>PJ's Hey dude, why are you in footies?</v>

61
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.370
<v 0>You 28 year old shoulders for days though. Dude.</v>

62
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.950
Talk about a shoulder workout. If you do the pommel horse, if you do the rings,

63
00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.260
you could literally, you could literally rip apart.

64
00:04:06.261 --> 00:04:07.400
People's face.

65
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.780
You go in their mouth and just rip it open and they go like this and you go

66
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.790
traps. That's what you say.

67
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.620
Look at these videos. There's one video. YouTube top my top seven.

68
00:04:19.621 --> 00:04:24.240
Favorite G Ray, gymnastic rings videos. Hey man.

69
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.530
Wow. That's a fan. Oh dude.

70
00:04:28.531 --> 00:04:32.550
Nobody Asian stewed rings. You know why Asians?

71
00:04:32.551 --> 00:04:37.110
Because their legs are for four pounds. Look at the way they do it, dude.

72
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.410
They just to be able to just hold the rings like that, dude.

73
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.480
<v 1>I mean, how do they do this?</v>

74
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.610
<v 0>Unbelievable. I got to get good at that. If you can do the rings,</v>

75
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:51.723
God,

76
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.400
that's so funny that you could be so fit and be so awesome at the rings,

77
00:04:57.401 --> 00:04:59.440
but probably still get no checks, you know?

78
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.740
Cause you're it like he does what girl wants to be like, oh yeah.

79
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.720
What's your boyfriend. Do you want, he does the rings? What? He's a jeweler.

80
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.850
No, you know, it's tube.

81
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.350
Handlebar rings that come down from the heavens.

82
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.360
<v 3>Also. Why are they always so tethered so high?</v>

83
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.590
<v 2>Like you could literally have a ribbon that big.</v>

84
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.170
It could be a foot.

85
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.140
<v 0>I guess I gotta go high. So they're gonna be six feet,</v>

86
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.580
but they're always coming from the heavens dude.

87
00:05:33.581 --> 00:05:36.160
They're always coming from 500 feet up.

88
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.980
Jesus is up there holding the ribbons like this

89
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.900
while the Asian we'll do what we'll do. That's what Jesus is thinking.

90
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.110
So Croatian it'd be good at the rings.

91
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.870
Yeah, dude. It's so Croatian to be good at the rings, dude. You know what?

92
00:05:54.871 --> 00:05:59.840
It's so Croatian to be living so hard to do the

93
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:04.790
Olympics dude, to be, they talk about, you know,

94
00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:07.540
who talks about the Olympics, all your long Croatians

95
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.900
dude. Every day, Croatians in Croatia say,

96
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.970
well the Olympics are coming up. You'll know. So, ah, dude.

97
00:06:21.971 --> 00:06:26.200
Well that makes me laugh, dude. Thinking about Croatians love in the Olympics.
