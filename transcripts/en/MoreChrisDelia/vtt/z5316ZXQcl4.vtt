00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.110
<v 0>Have you guys seen the Fortnite competition? The guy won $3 million.</v>

2
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.283
<v 1>That's cool.</v>

3
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.480
<v 0>I don't even think about that. When somebody tells me something like that,</v>

4
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.770
it goes out of my brain and then I got to do whatever I do, but I wrote it down.

5
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.540
Cause I was like, maybe I should talk about it, but.

6
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.103
<v 1>I don't know, man.</v>

7
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.610
<v 0>Games, right? Video games are surprisingly fun to watch though.</v>

8
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.890
I don't know why I used to have a F uh, my buddy,

9
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.870
my friend used to say nothing's more boring than watching

10
00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:38.420
someone play video games. And I totally disagree with him.

11
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.863
Some guy,

12
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.430
one fortnight the competition and made $3 million.

13
00:00:46.431 --> 00:00:50.270
And he's like 20, he's like 2016. He's 16 years old.

14
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.070
And there was a guy that was 24. That was repping for the old. He was like,

15
00:00:55.071 --> 00:00:57.350
I'm repping for the old guys. And he's 24.

16
00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.383
<v 1>Bro.</v>

17
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.330
<v 0>Fortnite world cup was a kid's paradise. It says here, this kid won $3 million.</v>

18
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.003

19 year, sorry.

22
00:01:18.051 --> 00:01:23.000
The 16 year old North America East player finished with 59 points and

23
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:24.260
take some, a prize with 3 million.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.963
<v 1>Cool.</v>

25
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.560

<v 1>Whatever.</v>

31
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.190
<v 0>Fat, you know, Nate is the worst one with a Y in it. You,</v>

32
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.090
what do you all rapper in the nineties, Nate?

33
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.020
One half a million DJ quick, one, three,

34
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.650
and then red man. And Keith Murray.

35
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.990
Remember Keith Murray, dude, that guy, I love Keith Murray.

36
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.120
Cause everyone else was like making names. And he was just like,

37
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.230
honestly going to be my name. DJ Quik,

38
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.190
Q U I K and all that. And DJ and Keith Murray was like,

39
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.950
all good. I'll just be the guy I am.

40
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.710
<v 1>Hello.</v>

41
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.880
<v 0>Love Keith Marie. Love all love. All love. Rap is the only,</v>

42
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.190
you don't want to think. Hertz rap.

43
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.240
Rap is the only, uh, genre of music where there's.

44
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.810
<v 1>Old school. Why do you label it that,</v>

45
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.223
you know what I mean?

46
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.150
<v 0>If you didn't label it that then the guys who were old school would still</v>

47
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.640
the could still be relevant. But the second you say they're old school.

48
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.630
It makes them not relevant anymore. Like, I'm sorry, but Eric sermon

49
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.000
rips. A lot of you, young guys don't know what the that is.

50
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:15.340
Like if you play Fortnite, you probably don't know who Eric sermon is,

51
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.140
but he rips like,

52
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:22.810
I guess Jay Z would be old school, but he's, he's still kinda,

53
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.320
he still makes music that kind of rips, I guess,

54
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.450
jump out like yeah. Who the you wit

55
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.460
jumped out? Like yeah. Who the you wit? Um, yeah, so

56
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.110
I don't know if, uh, yeah. Video games, I guess,

57
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.850
are going to start building stadiums for video games, which is, which is wild.

58
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.410
You know, think about like the actual

59
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.690
people in the stadium, watching the Fortnite world cup. I would,

60
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.430
I would argue there's never been a more,

61
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.530
a bigger group of unathletic people in a stadium

62
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.390
than in that moment. These guys just like, well, you know,

63
00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:20.140
I think FACHE honestly, you know, I mean, he's, he's number 10, but you know,

64
00:04:20.141 --> 00:04:24.640
he could move up a few seeds. Fats is looking good.

65
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:29.110
Nate is looking good. Um, you know,

66
00:04:29.111 --> 00:04:33.700
honestly I get booga could take it away, but you know,

67
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.560
it's like 1.8 million for a second place. That's not too shabby. Like, you know,

68
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.850
that's the thing like, Oh, you know,

69
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.510
if I played video games and someone was like, Oh, you're a dork. I'd be like,

70
00:04:46.511 --> 00:04:49.750
you, God right. I am, you are. Right. I am

71
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.283
named Colin is the.

72
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.230
Somebody wrote me on Instagram about my tattoo.

73
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:02.860
And he was like, your tattoo sucks. This and that. Or I don't, you know,

74
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.850
I remember exactly what he said. He said, you don't get it on your hand.

75
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.750
The first tattoo trying too hard. And I was like,

76
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.560
Oh yeah. It was like,

77
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.690
that's I guess you're trying to keep 16 year old girls liking you or something.

78
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.740
And I was like, why are you so concerned? You know, I had to do a clap back.

79
00:05:23.741 --> 00:05:28.300
I had to send him to Denny's is all good. But he ordered, you know,

80
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:31.750
he sat down at Denny's sorry, at the grand summer. And I said,

81
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.130
why are you so concerned with 16 year old girls? You pedophile. I said,

82
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.240
also you're fat. Cause I looked at his profile and he was hefty.

83
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.620
And he said, Oh, so you're just going to name, call bro.

84
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.190
You don't get to do that, man.

85
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.930
You walked in this Denny's, this is what we serve.

86
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.390
You don't, you don't know, uh.

87
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.013
<v 1>Uh.</v>

88
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.090
<v 0>You know, but you want it to,</v>

89
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.560
I can't help it,

90
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.580
that you can't go back in time and erase the beginnings of that.

91
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.220
But you can't.

92
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.800
<v 1>Dude, are you.</v>

93
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.690
<v 0>Do you have a phone booth that goes back in time that sprays purple and green</v>

94
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.050
missed. If you do then go ahead and try to delete that.

95
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.850
But you can't because those don't exist yet.

96
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.370
<v 1>So why is your nose facing my nose?</v>

97
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.500
Well, what am I ever talking about?
