It's hilarious. And by the way, good actors in that movie.

10

Just the way it's cast and how put together it is, bro.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.880
It's such a like Jason is in it.

but if Jay but Jason Derulo, his whole life is a Sprite commercial.

21
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.900
I don't give a dude. I can just imagine him just going like boop, boop,

22
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:34.100
boop, boop, boop. The fact that Jason Derulo, isn't it.

23

<v 2>You know what? He's in his programmers. I don't give a.</v>

24
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.210
He's gotta be in the Sprite numbers. If he's not in Sprite, commercial,

25
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.100
he's in the Sprite commercial. Okay.

26
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.420
<v 0>He I've never seen someone who would more be in a Sprite commercial than Jason</v>

27
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.120
Derulo. Like not in the Coke commercial, you know?

28
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.850

<v 2>John Lennon is the though. That imagined song.</v>

39
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.780
I mean it's disrespectful, but John Lennon is the.

40
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.310
I remember when I was a kid,

41
00:02:40.311 --> 00:02:43.160
I saw a movie called backbeat about the Beatles with my parents.

42
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.300
And Ringo was only in like two scenes. And after the movie, I said to my dad,

43
00:02:47.301 --> 00:02:49.580
I said, Hey, imagine you were in you, you,

44
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.700
you were an actor and you got the part of Ringo and you're like, Hey guys,

45
00:02:52.701 --> 00:02:55.160
I'm going to be in a movie about the Beatles. And I play Ringo.

46
00:02:55.161 --> 00:02:58.370
People will be like so like excited. And then you're only in two scenes.

47
00:02:58.371 --> 00:03:00.100
And then my dad and it made me feel.

48
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.900
<v 0>So good. And because I love to make my parents laugh all the time.</v>

49
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.520
And that's probably what made me why I'm a comedian. Uh,

50
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.580
so here we go. Ads. We go wiggle with it.

The next two are the S so much people that

143
00:09:32.961 --> 00:09:34.340
would be in the movie cats.

144
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:39.860
They would literally like a real talking cat would get over.

145
00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.980
They would, it'd be like, well, that's between you and a real talking cat.

146
00:09:42.981 --> 00:09:43.341
And they'd be like,

147
00:09:43.341 --> 00:09:46.070
and you got it because of course you're going to be in this movie because it's

148
00:09:46.071 --> 00:09:48.980
you okay. A real talking cat will be like,

149
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.640

155
00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:15.440

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:34.160
I cannot wait to see the, for real horse he's wearing.

161
00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:34.993
<v 1>Dude.</v>

162
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.630
<v 0>And I'd be like, what are you doing? I'm just wiggling with it.</v>

163
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:44.900
<v 1>Dude. Like it when's it come out, dude.</v>

164
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:49.730
<v 0>I've talked about cats in this thing. It comes out soon, right?</v>

165
00:10:49.731 --> 00:10:51.320
It's a good time for sure. Christmas movie.

166
00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.900
Is this more for kids, dude? It's so creepy. If I was a kid,

167
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.780
this is how I'd be like when my mom said, Hey, you want to go see cats?

168
00:10:59.781 --> 00:11:04.490
I go like this, know what? W w it's for kids. I go like this.

169
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.320
Now why to kill.

170
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:08.653
<v 1>To Kelly.</v>

171
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.060
<v 0>You don't want to go in. No, I'll stay in the car. You go see it.</v>

172
00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:18.020
It's too Kelly. I'll stay in the stroller.

173
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:22.010
You go in there always to carry. But Jason Derulo is in it.

174
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.080
That's tick Nicholas, but Judy Dench is in it.

175
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:31.460
Of course she is James Corden plays Busta for Jones. Dusk

176
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.890
does counting crows song. Jennifer Hudson's in it.

177
00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:41.210
Does she play Gracelle but that makes sense. Taylor Swift is in it.

178
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:45.320
Burn ballerina curse. And they're going to go to see stupid Gelica CAS,

179
00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:51.950
negotiates, Angelica CAS. You made me go see the music or I hate that.

180
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.520
Desper that's read in four.

181
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.360
That was wrote in the people who wrote down was on Dallas D

182
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.210
and then 1980s, the poop it,

183
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:10.330
um, let's look at the cat's trailer, dude. I know we've seen it,

184
00:12:10.331 --> 00:12:14.530
but we got to see it again. Dude. Wiggle, wiggle with it. Meow, Meow, Meow,

185
00:12:14.531 --> 00:12:18.190
Meow, Meow cats movie.

186
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:19.750
No,

187
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:23.200
I'd rather stay in the car and put my pants and just have a shutter diaper for

188
00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:26.320
two hours. But no buts,

189
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:32.520
say how fun, but it's a universal pick.

190
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:35.250
They make good movies, but this one's a weird one.

191
00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:45.030
I'm sorry, dude. The cat's got a top hat I'm out. I can't. I mean,

192
00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.090
talk about, gelical

193
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.500
talk about gelical.

194
00:12:55.830 --> 00:13:00.480
I cannot believe that Jason dural is in this movie,

195
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.830
dude. I swear to God at the end of this movie, the cat goes no. And he goes,

196
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.410
what's that in your cat pocket and pulls out a Sprite. And he goes,

197
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.160
[inaudible] wiggle, wiggle with it.

198
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:17.063
<v 1>So beautiful.</v>

199
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.240
<v 0>Oh wow. There's a thing in the back of his milk bar.</v>

200
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:33.270
I haven't seen before. Cause you're a human cat.

201
00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:41.910
<v 1>Little they're little for a new life.</v>

202
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:45.090
That's me. Twirling cats

203
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:48.900
in a room. That's so ornate.

204
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.360
They've got ears that are on top of their heads,

205
00:13:54.361 --> 00:13:58.590
but also somehow it's not uncomfortable for them to wear hats.

206
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:06.810
James Courtney, of course. And Judy Dench, of course.

207
00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:12.090
And also of course, Jason Derulo, drinking spray, Idris Elba. For some reason,

208
00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:13.920
Jennifer Hudson.

209
00:14:13.921 --> 00:14:18.330
Remember her Ian McKellen is naturally Taylor

210
00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.590
Swift vehicle

211
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.260
and rebel Wilson does stuff like falls down and stuff.

212
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:33.310
Does it say, does it have the nerve to say introducing someone? No.

213
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:37.650
<v 0>No, no. That's a joke, right? That didn't say that. Did it. Oh</v>

214
00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:46.290

215
00:14:46.291 --> 00:14:50.730
it's introducing an actor, bro. I haven't seen that in years, dude.

216
00:14:50.731 --> 00:14:53.450
I haven't seen that since like a Sundance movie.

217
00:14:53.451 --> 00:14:57.860
And when Sundance first came and introducing ed burns dude and this

218
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.510

<v 0>Just say introducing another cat.</v>

225
00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:34.090

228
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.330
Dude. That drives me nuts when they do that.

229
00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.570

00:21:59.881 --> 00:22:03.180
They say, you know, what's weird is sometimes they don't have the, uh,

310
00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:04.470
what do you call it? The um,

311
00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:09.540
th the CGI all done until the movie.

312
00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:12.000
Like they won't have it done on the trailer and they will have it done in the

313
00:22:12.001 --> 00:22:15.000
movie. So maybe that's what's up, but universal pictures, you know, they come,

314
00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:19.740
somebody wrote on the comments under it.

[inaudible] memories are about nine 50, but if you'll get two,

321
00:22:48.601 --> 00:22:49.434
we'll give you a

322
00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:57.960
[inaudible] three for two ma'am

323
00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:03.510
you can buy a dozen and we'll charge you for dad,

324
00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:05.850
mammaries whatever.

325
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:09.630
<v 2>In the middle of cats, it went off the rails and that's the song that happened.</v>

326
00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.740
You understand how that would be my favorite movie. Do you understand?

327
00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:18.120
You don't do it. You don't and they'll just keep making the same,

328
00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:24.000
grow some balls and bastardized some, man.

329
00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:30.150
I'll never be in another movie again after this podcast, but you know,

330
00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:35.040
maybe Netflix, Netflix seems to employ your boy.

331
00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.250
I might do this movie in January. I'm not sure yet.

332
00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:48.140
And I told him to write more off scenes in them in it. And they were like,

333
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:48.801
you got it.

334
00:23:48.801 --> 00:23:51.740
And they sent me the signs and I'm ripping through the jungle with my shirts

335
00:23:51.741 --> 00:23:52.574
off.

336
00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:56.620
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>

337
00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.090
<v 2>Do it. I just want to be in a movie where I'm just like.</v>
