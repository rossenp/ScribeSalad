1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.390
<v 0>Tastes bugs. They come into the mic, talking about the food.</v>

2
00:00:03.391 --> 00:00:06.420
They hate talking about the food they like to, fool's gonna fate,

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.260
but only one food Temby rate, taste buds, man. Didn't come into them.

4
00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:12.930
I come shock and say, taste birds.

5
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.090
<v 1>He's a sweetie pies. It's a taste buds. Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.890
The show where me and this guy debate food. Yeah. I mean,

7
00:00:21.891 --> 00:00:25.490
if you, if you're watching, if you're new to taste buds where the buds,

8
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.460
where the bud, you see the, the name is very Woody. You see,

9
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.280
we went through dozens of choices and we thought taste buds.

10
00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:35.300
We debate foods all the time. When we hang out and with fervor,

11
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.990
with VIM and vigor, we debate, am I right? Yes. We're passionate about it.

12
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.660
We don't mind. We will have we, Oh,

13
00:00:41.661 --> 00:00:45.650
what an ideal day for us would be is if we have an exchange of dialogue,

14
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.060
will we just really dig in and, and go over the minutia of something? Yes.

15
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.300
Over and over. It's how that, it's how we are wired. Yes.

16
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.950
And it happens all the time. And a lot of times it happens with food options.

17
00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.840
And so here we debate food.

18
00:00:59.841 --> 00:01:04.730
We put the Twitter poll out at the top of the episode, we pick a side, um,

19
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.730
it's, it is based on what we feel passionate about.

20
00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:11.060
So we're not just arguing for arguing sake here. Right?

21
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.220
That's a big caveat that I don't know if we ever mentioned,

22
00:01:13.221 --> 00:01:16.700
it's gotta be something that we disagree on organically.

23
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.390
And not that you hate the other item, but hands down,

24
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.930
you will die on the Hill of the item you're defending versus the other item.

25
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.940
Yes. A hundred percent, a hundred percent.

26
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.650
And sometimes you do hate the other item. Yeah. Sometimes you don't, but, uh,

27
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.940
these are real food debates we've had in private and now we're bringing them

28
00:01:34.941 --> 00:01:38.690
public. Uh, and then at the end of that, at the end of the episode, uh,

29
00:01:38.691 --> 00:01:41.420
these are like fun little half hour episodes. We, uh,

30
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.960
have a segment called humble pie where we go to the polls and we use the polls

31
00:01:44.961 --> 00:01:49.910
as the, be all end, all answer to, uh, to the debate that we're having. And,

32
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.490
uh, you know, the person who loses seats a little bit of humble pie. Right.

33
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.520
Right. Even though they're still right. We'll be like puns.

34
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.510
We'll be like food puns.

35
00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.310
We were leaning in hard to the foodies buds pie pie. I'm sure.

36
00:02:01.311 --> 00:02:05.770
We'll come up with more. Yeah. Something great. We're going to start getting,

37
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.590
yeah, that was one of them too. Yes. But taste buds was perfect.

38
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.980
These spreads is, I mean, we should, if you have them in your phone one day,

39
00:02:12.981 --> 00:02:16.450
is it like a little thing we should read all the things you may be.

40
00:02:16.451 --> 00:02:19.730
We're going to call it. Oh yeah. And then wait. No,

41
00:02:19.731 --> 00:02:23.330
my phone's charging or another. We'll do another one. Yeah. Um,

42
00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:26.150
so today's Throwdown. Yes.

43
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.570
This is a big one. This is what is the best traditional.

44
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.330
Hi. Hi, traditional Apple, not Apple crumb. None of the Chrome stuff.

45
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.660
Just regular, straight up Apple pie versus regular,

46
00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:44.840
straight up peach pie pie. Uh,

47
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.800
I predict right out of the gate that this is the first episode of taste where I

48
00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:53.630
will walk away. The Victor Sao has foolishly

49
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.770
chosen peach, peach pie.

50
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.410
I stand by it ever since I'm little. I have nothing against Apple.

51
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:05.020
I really gotta be in the mood for Apple. I think it's overplayed.

52
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.430
I think don't listen. We didn't start the poll yet. Don't waste your sorry.

53
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.150
I wish I was going in hard on the app. Don't waste your. Jesus. He's already,

54
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.490
he Hickey better pie. Traditional Apple, traditional peach.

55
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.700
And that's a tweet right there. It's out. It's out. All right. Now,

56
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.290
go ahead with, let the game nauseousness, you were just spewing, you know,

57
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.470
few things in my life where you just about to say I'm sick, Apple pie.

58
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.510
Would you just read it? Yeah, I was gonna really,

59
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.440
but then I decided to explain to you what I mean Apple pie. I don't hate it,

60
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.980
but I had to be in the mood for it. And it is delicious when made, right.

61
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.440
Especially with a scoop ice cream hot, but again,

62
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.820
we're not adding the bells and whistles.

63
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.380
So you're talking about a slice of traditional occupy on its own and a slice of

64
00:03:46.381 --> 00:03:48.510
peach pie on its own.

65
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.250
There are a few things in my life that I can name that I've had that I used to

66
00:03:53.251 --> 00:03:56.880
love. And then I ate them so much. I got sick of them and I,

67
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.260
I'm not saying that had more Apple pie.

68
00:03:58.261 --> 00:04:00.210
I didn't eat Apple pie until I got sick of it.

69
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.190
But Apple pie is around so much that I am sick of it. It's just like,

70
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.980
don't get me wrong if there's no other pie. And you're like,

71
00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:11.510
do you want a nice hot slice of alibi? I'll be like, I have it. You know what?

72
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.570
I find a lot with Apple pie. I'll take a bite. I'll take two bites.

73
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.820
If it's not Chrome or doesn't have any other bells and whistles.

74
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.340
I tap out after a couple of bites.

75
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.820
It's a little too much of that Apple saucy.

76
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.170
I extended really to the Apple. The Apple is the culprit.

77
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.630
I'm I was never a big Apple fan my whole life.

78
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.410
I think the apples are a little too pungent, little too sweet and tart.

79
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.340
And I take a bite of an Apple and I chew and I go, no, I get it. I get it.

80
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.230
I get it.

81
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.690
An apples close to a pair and a pick and take a and jump over a bridge.

82
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.610
A pair is terrible, but anyway, um, like pairs, a pair,

83
00:04:47.611 --> 00:04:51.780
I think is the most overrated fruit ever in existence. No,

84
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.710
that's the cantaloupe is the most overrated. No way. Cantaloupe is great. Okay.

85
00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.170
Mark it down. [inaudible]

86
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.740
I'll smash it for fun. I won't even put it in my mouth. Okay.

87
00:05:04.741 --> 00:05:07.660
I've never seen someone purchase a pair. Yeah.

88
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.980
That's already been in the market with me, the whole other episodes show me

89
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.240
and we just write it down. So the thing about the Apple pie is like,

90
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.670
it's always the go-to pie as well. Like my, I think conversely,

91
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.040
one of the best fruits ever made the swans.

92
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.250
I mean the fruit of all fruits is a peach.

93
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.680
When you have the right peach,

94
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.500
a ripe beautiful peaches better than a perfect Apple,

95
00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:38.940
it really is a peach is succulent juicy, bursting wood flavor,

96
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.650
citrus notes. It just live in just tastes buds. Your senses.

97
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.450
It is invigorating. I love it. I love peach in my ice tea.

98
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.590
I love peaches. Peach is I as, as,

99
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.580
as versatile as an Apple is I think a peach is nearly as versatile with none of

100
00:05:56.581 --> 00:06:00.890
the credit. Uh, granted my favorite dish is more of like a cobbler or whatever,

101
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.670
but I will tell you peaches, aren't always in season,

102
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.120
it's a treat to get a peach pie. Uh, everything,

103
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:10.910
a peach represents just a juicy, beautiful peach.

104
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.040
I feel like it's a summery thing.

105
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.490
Now I know Apple pie is America raw.

106
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.890
Like I know the speech you're going to give it because it's it's,

107
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.930
it's like a hug from your mother. Just like the cinnamon raisin Vega.

108
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.600
I that's not what I was going to say.

109
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:31.220
What I was going to say is a peach in its pure form is everything you

110
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:32.090
described it as.

111
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:37.340
And then somebody takes it and cuts it up and ruins it by putting it into a

112
00:06:37.341 --> 00:06:41.870
hot mess of a thing. It tastes a peat up the Apple.

113
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:44.503
Apple's a different story.

114
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.310
I'll take a peach over an Apple off the tree any day of the week.

115
00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.450
Interesting. You cook those things. You cook those things.

116
00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:57.440
You're in different territory. Now you want to talk about, uh,

117
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.450
to like everything you described as good about the peach is

118
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:06.470
lost in peach pie. You get none of that flavor and peach pie,

119
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.400
peach pie just tastes sugary.

120
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.630
It just tastes sweet. None of the layered notes of an actual piece,

121
00:07:14.631 --> 00:07:16.310
where are you buying your peach pies?

122
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.200
Where are you buying your Apple pie that you're saying there's too much

123
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.050
[inaudible] in it or whatever the hell you say. And as I said, the Apple,

124
00:07:21.051 --> 00:07:25.760
sauciness when you cut it, all that stuff, that's like, it's almost like the,

125
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.430
uh, like, like in those stuff, like every pie that like,

126
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.430
you ha you need this stuff to bond it. Like, yeah. Yeah.

127
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:35.930
Every pie has that stuff, but it's too happily for me. But every pie has that.

128
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.820
Every part I'm saying you got to be not the ones that's in the app.

129
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.610
Like the Apple on Apple is just, it's just too.

130
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:49.160
It looks like a lot of nice Apple. See like gunk in the middle of Brown gunk.

131
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:53.090
Look at peach pie, peach pie. It looks like it's not even like a real food.

132
00:07:53.091 --> 00:07:56.750
By the time it comes out. Look out, look at the color of it. A peach pie,

133
00:07:56.751 --> 00:08:00.680
a beautiful, vibrant peach pie with look at the color of it. That looks natural.

134
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.860
Unnatural. It looks orange. Orange is a primary color.

135
00:08:03.861 --> 00:08:05.930
What are you talking about? It's Raji, Bev, Ritz,

136
00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.090
the Owen Roy that looks unnatural, dude.

137
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.270
And that doesn't taste like peaches when you eat it. And you know, it,

138
00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:12.770
it doesn't taste like punches.

139
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.490
This is a classic DeRosa move he takes.

140
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.580
And now he's shifting the argument to he's.

141
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:23.720
He's making you think that peach pie doesn't taste like peaches does he? Okay.

142
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.810
But I mean, for the, this, these purposes, a peach pie,

143
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.940
I'm talking about the tasting of a peach pie.

144
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.900
So you're going to take away the fact that my peach pie tastes like peaches,

145
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.790
how much it doesn't taste like beaches. I love canned peaches.

146
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:38.150
I love peach peaches. I love a SRE,

147
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.160
a fruit cocktail with the peaches in it.

148
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:46.010
Peach pie and peach cobbler are the only two forms of peach.

149
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.940
I don't, I love peach ice tea. It's my favorite flavor. Peach pie.

150
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.570
Listen to what he's saying. He chooses a peach off the tree,

151
00:08:53.571 --> 00:08:55.950
over an Apple and peach is his favorite. Oh,

152
00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:59.610
your favorite ice tea is not Apple peach pie and peach cobbler are the only two

153
00:08:59.611 --> 00:09:02.850
flavors of peach. I don't like because they don't taste like peach.

154
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:09.240
Peaches are loaded with sugar. My friend that is not the natural peach.

155
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.670
I feel more like a pizza, but you get yourself. But we're both saying here,

156
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.940
pick your pick the bakery or the chef or whatever.

157
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:21.420
That's making the best of the best. I'm talking about the best.

158
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:25.530
Not like you had some peach pie that didn't taste like peach. I'm talking about.

159
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.570
Let's talk about the both pies,

160
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.740
the way that they should be presented at that Shelly's mess. It's disgusting.

161
00:09:31.741 --> 00:09:35.160
Looking look at that. No, it's not gusting. Look it is.

162
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:39.090
That looks like gentle largess and there's little notes of red on the skin that

163
00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:39.924
they left in there.

164
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:44.640
And you get these deep notes of red with these bright orange slices.

165
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.140
You want colors? Go look at a painting. I'm talking about flavor here.

166
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:52.800
I want to taste the pie. I want it to taste good. That looks nuts to me.

167
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.250
That looks abscond. And we're not even getting into a scoop of,

168
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.370
of ice cream and or a dollop of whipped cream. But if you put,

169
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.700
you don't want to go down that road, I would an Apple pie. It's on,

170
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:06.720
it's on menus and restaurants, all a mode. And you can add it to any pot.

171
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.220
With a dollop of whipped cream is way better on a peach pie than an Apple pie.

172
00:10:11.221 --> 00:10:15.210
I said it and I stand by it. Who gives a? If you whipped cream can take a swim.

173
00:10:15.211 --> 00:10:19.710
I don't care. I'm not rushing. All right. All right.

174
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.180
Well fine. But whipped cream for me stops at cool whip, Anthony. Cool with,

175
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.330
but I could care less.

176
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.650
You had the nerve in the last episode to say that everything bagel seasoning was

177
00:10:28.651 --> 00:10:32.430
for trash people and you're telling me your whipped cream stops at cool whip.

178
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.310
If it ain't cool whip, you don't want any, I didn't say miracle whip.

179
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.740
That would be trash. I told her,

180
00:10:37.741 --> 00:10:40.900
I'm talking about fresh made whipped cream and you brought up cool whipped,

181
00:10:40.901 --> 00:10:42.390
whipped cream. I guess. That's cool.

182
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.820
If I have coop downstairs and I have already whipped and I love whipped cream,

183
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:49.320
but if I'm not having nothing has ever taken up more needless space on a plate,

184
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:53.690
this is when you're ready with, this is what you do. What you did this to you,

185
00:10:53.691 --> 00:10:56.580
you applied, you applied the argument to the,

186
00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.580
you denied me my argument for the Oreo.

187
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:04.770
And then you took that same thing and you applied it to the cinnamon

188
00:11:04.771 --> 00:11:09.600
raisin bagel. You pick sides, you play the sides. And now,

189
00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:12.120
now you, you play the sides

190
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:19.080
because you just said, what did you just say? I said, ready with miracle.

191
00:11:19.081 --> 00:11:21.720
Whip is cool whip or cool whip. And you say,

192
00:11:21.721 --> 00:11:24.180
you don't want to hear nothing when it comes to court, but then you had the,

193
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.440
you had the, I said,

194
00:11:25.441 --> 00:11:28.650
nothing takes up more useless space on a plate than ready whip.

195
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.120
My point to you was,

196
00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:34.380
you said the buck stops at cool whip with you who have cream. And I said to you,

197
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:38.100
you had the, you had the gumption. Yes. And you had the,

198
00:11:38.101 --> 00:11:42.270
you had the sack to tell me that everything bagel

199
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:47.730
seasoning in a, a, in a jar is for trash people.

200
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:52.800
And then you told me the buck stops at cool whip was here and you're not playing

201
00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:57.130
sides, no mango seasonings for trash people. I sent it my head.

202
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:01.210
They cool with it. I mean, cool up is if the light I, I'm not

203
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.980
[inaudible] against cool whip. A Coolup is where, like, when we grew up,

204
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.370
like you got cool whip and like, you were like, I mean, it's like, it's,

205
00:12:09.371 --> 00:12:13.270
entry-level something, God blessed. You whip at you too. You're telling me,

206
00:12:13.271 --> 00:12:14.620
you're telling me everything.

207
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:18.670
Everything bagel mix in a jar by trader Joe's is a

208
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.710
[inaudible] topic that it was only really put into the marketing.

209
00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:26.200
It was only really put into the market. In the last couple of years,

210
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.090
it sells at a premium.

211
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.050
That is an item that is much more artisinal than a bucket of cream.

212
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:35.740
And you just get the bucket. Of course. Get your precious peaches on the right.

213
00:12:35.741 --> 00:12:39.010
It does. I told you, I told you, let me tell you this. Let me tell you this.

214
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.820
This is how much I stand by what I said, cool website. Kool-Aid I like it,

215
00:12:42.821 --> 00:12:45.940
but it's also on the, on the bottom of the rung of ladder.

216
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.820
Whereas in artismal thing, like an everything bagel,

217
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:54.010
I'm so confused by the clash of you having both in your kitchen downstairs.

218
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.930
Cause I know that you have depends on my mood.

219
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.770
I feel like I just went into a trailer in a trailer park and saw Rembrandt on

220
00:12:59.771 --> 00:13:03.370
the wall. I don't know what direction this guy's coming from saying about you.

221
00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.990
You, you have some nerve because you, you can't call everything bagel,

222
00:13:07.991 --> 00:13:09.850
seasoning for trash people and then say,

223
00:13:09.851 --> 00:13:13.540
cool whip is for the hierarchy for the foot. You can't say it's for the

224
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:18.460
populace of the multiuse. It doesn't work like that to be a rare commodity.

225
00:13:18.461 --> 00:13:22.270
What do you want for me? It was, we're getting off you open Gatsby's about pies.

226
00:13:22.271 --> 00:13:24.040
You open Gatsby's refrigerator.

227
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:27.970
You think you see an everything bagel seasoning first or bucket of cream,

228
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.310
a bucket of cooler. You crazy crazy.

229
00:13:30.311 --> 00:13:33.460
Now I know you're not playing with a full deck. Cool whip before. Listen to me.

230
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:36.570
Okay, cool. Whip comes up in a search. Google.

231
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:41.470
It comes up with tag and pop rocks. That's a cooler comes up on. Cool up,

232
00:13:41.471 --> 00:13:45.400
comes up next to, uh, the, the drink of our finance astronauts,

233
00:13:45.401 --> 00:13:49.990
the brave man and outer space. I'm proud to see it there and next to pop rocks,

234
00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.990
which I also consider it. See, can we hold on a minute?

235
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:54.550
Because we do say this is educational.

236
00:13:54.551 --> 00:13:59.200
Sometimes the reason those came up together is the same guy.

237
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:02.800
William A. Mitchell invented all of them.

238
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:04.870
<v 2>All your favorite trashy foods.</v>

239
00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.800
<v 1>They call it trashy food.</v>

240
00:14:11.801 --> 00:14:15.370
And the title of the article I eat.

241
00:14:15.371 --> 00:14:18.070
Sometimes it is a burden being described.

242
00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.020
It is a burden. When you can pull up reports,

243
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:28.750
we're way off base here. We're way off top named Mitchell shout out.

244
00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:30.610
Cause he invented tank cool whip and popper.

245
00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:35.570
<v 2>Yeah. I find Tang. Disgusting. I can't taste it. Take it or leave it.</v>

246
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.350
That's funny. D also I find it's orange beverage. Disgusting. Yeah.

247
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:44.850
Yeah. Now, now let's get back to the pies. Okay.

248
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:49.620
<v 1>You're telling me here's something. No human being has ever.</v>

249
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.660
<v 2>Said, especially in the United States of America, man,</v>

250
00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.860
you got peach pie. Nobody's ever said that. No, he's never been a diner.

251
00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:01.630
<v 1>Yep. Peach pie. I love you. But if this podcast is going to work,</v>

252
00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:06.250
you have to make arguments that make sense. You can't make a statement, Joe,

253
00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:10.000
you can, I'm doing this now. I'm actually being your bud. In this situation,

254
00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.080
you can't make a statement.

255
00:15:11.081 --> 00:15:13.450
Like no one in this history of the United States has ever said,

256
00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:17.960
do you have pinch pot? That's crazy. I've never seen it served after.

257
00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:22.630
<v 2>A meal. I've never seen it in a diner. Okay. And I've seen it.</v>

258
00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:23.700
<v 1>I mean, I mean, I,</v>

259
00:15:23.701 --> 00:15:27.620
I can't wait till we disconnect and I'd tell you the last time we ate it because

260
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.620
we both, but I, I can't, I can't talk about it right now. Yeah. Yeah.

261
00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.740
Cause it's, it's a sensitive matter, but it's okay. I'll I'll remind you later.

262
00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:40.690
I remind you later on. I, you never seen it served. I guess I got new soil.

263
00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:41.800
I got no sweat.

264
00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.100
If I was anywhere and it was served. I said, what do you mean.

265
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:51.910
<v 3>Get out of here?</v>

266
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:54.460
<v 1>I gotta be honest. If, if it's,</v>

267
00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:59.350
if an Apple pie is on a menu and there's also something like a key lime or a,

268
00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.510
like a Boston cream or something like that,

269
00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.570
I'll always go something other than Apple, Apple. It's like,

270
00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:08.890
if you just have Apple, I'll have Apple, but I'm taking a key lime.

271
00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.040
Even I even, even sometimes a lemon Marino.

272
00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.350
<v 2>I'll take a lemon. Marangu sometimes over an Apple.</v>

273
00:16:14.351 --> 00:16:15.460
It depends on what I'm in the mood for.

274
00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:17.380
But if you're talking about throwing down.

275
00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.820
<v 1>You don't like peach pie. You don't like peach pie. You don't like it.</v>

276
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.060
<v 2>Hey. I mean every word about to come on my mouth. I mean, it,</v>

277
00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.830
it takes every element. I love about peaches and ruins. It.

278
00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:34.510
It doesn't taste like peaches anymore. To me, what? It tastes like pushy.

279
00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.620
Hi, sweet flavorless, kinder.

280
00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:40.570
<v 1>Fruit, Apple pie. You haven't had good peach pie buddies.</v>

281
00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.560
<v 2>Apple pie is more reminiscent of a peach to me because of the tartness peach pie</v>

282
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:44.981
has never,

283
00:16:44.981 --> 00:16:48.880
every time I've had it or peach cobbler never has the tartness of a peach. Okay.

284
00:16:48.881 --> 00:16:52.390
It never has the juiciness. It's all gone. It's all just hot.

285
00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:57.610
<v 3>And I, I mean that.</v>

286
00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:02.020
<v 1>Not hot slop. And if anything, all pie becomes hot slop.</v>

287
00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.190
You can't assign hot slop to peach pie and not say that Apple pie is not hot

288
00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.910
slop. Same thing happens with blueberry pie. Like, like you lose all the crunch.

289
00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:13.240
You do lose a crunch in an Apple in a, in a, in an Apple pie.

290
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.170
<v 2>I'm not there for crunch. I'm not sitting there for quite a talk slop.</v>

291
00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:18.140
It's just.

292
00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:22.990
<v 1>What is all the Brown gel? All that Brown gel substance. If you look at the.</v>

293
00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:26.500
<v 2>Apples in these pictures, especially that one on the left with the,</v>

294
00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.620
I know it's a crumb one, but when the Apple is prepared like that,

295
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:30.820
that is a firmer.

296
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.950
<v 1>Bite of pie. You know why I hate that.</v>

297
00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.960
So the apples are sliced thin and long ways for the slice those

298
00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:41.290
long. See, now the one over there is the chunk I prefer.

299
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.860
Here's what I don't like about the way that you just as a slice one,

300
00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:46.990
when you take the fork and you go down,

301
00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:51.290
it shoots out from the fork and then you're not getting a proper.

302
00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.260
<v 2>But do you know why it shoots out? Because it's not mush.</v>

303
00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.100
I've never had peach pie where I got a firm bite of peach in my life.

304
00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.040
<v 1>If you're not eating there, listen, I'm not here to debate.</v>

305
00:18:01.041 --> 00:18:02.450
You know why I'm surprised you've eaten.

306
00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.630
You know why I'm not eating the right peach pie? Cause nobody has the.

307
00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:08.660
<v 2>That's my point. Nobody.</v>

308
00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:12.980
<v 1>Has never seen it on a menu in my life. That's Joe,</v>

309
00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:18.350
Joe, Joseph, you crazy. There was a diner.

310
00:18:18.351 --> 00:18:22.100
And you know what though? Do you want like peach pie is again,

311
00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:24.740
it has to be in season. And it also is like, yeah, it's,

312
00:18:24.741 --> 00:18:28.640
it's not there all the time. It makes you want it to make you miss it. Apple,

313
00:18:28.641 --> 00:18:31.970
Apple, Apple, Apple pie, everything. The most standard things in Apple pie.

314
00:18:31.971 --> 00:18:34.430
If I saw many of the hat and Apple pie, I would be like, you know what?

315
00:18:34.431 --> 00:18:37.090
This place can stand to be more creative with their dessert.

316
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:40.730
<v 2>Call. And I saw audible here. I'll call night's auto. Take Apple out of the mix.</v>

317
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:45.200
I still stand by it. It's what I said. I was throwing down with. Okay. Cherry,

318
00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.770
cherry crushes, peach pie. I love a cherry pie. Okay.

319
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.970
Well then we agree on that.

320
00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:54.200
<v 4>Great. A question. I absolutely love you. Agree that it crushes the peach.</v>

321
00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:58.010
<v 1>Well, hold on you think cherry? Oh, you don't think cherry crushes, Apple,</v>

322
00:18:58.011 --> 00:19:01.400
Apple Jennifer one, because I could have went up against you with three pies.

323
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.130
Cause my favorite three pars are peach, blueberry and cherry.

324
00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:07.040
<v 2>Blueberry. I would, I wouldn't walk.</v>

325
00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.950
<v 1>I wouldn't step on up. I'll tell you right now.</v>

326
00:19:09.951 --> 00:19:13.280
I even only went peach now because I've been in a real peach pie mood.

327
00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:15.320
But if you would have caught me in another day,

328
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:18.860
Sherry or I'm telling the blueberry might even blueberry might even be my

329
00:19:18.861 --> 00:19:19.694
favorite pie.

330
00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.670
<v 2>Grand slam blueberry is the other pie.</v>

331
00:19:22.671 --> 00:19:25.970
I refuse the dead serious. I wonder.

332
00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.190
<v 1>Sound reason. None of the.</v>

333
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:31.070
<v 2>Wonderful tartness of blueberry to it. It just.</v>

334
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:36.080
<v 1>You're not the right pies. No,</v>

335
00:19:36.081 --> 00:19:39.230
I don't like that. I don't like that one. No, I don't like that one. That,

336
00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:44.210
that one. I like, not that. Not that that, no.

337
00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:47.240
No. That's nice. That's even, I love that.

338
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:49.640
I love when they do the weave to the basket weave.

339
00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:53.060
<v 2>Yeah. Blueberry pie looks like, it looks like when you go to a fancy restaurant,</v>

340
00:19:53.061 --> 00:19:56.870
the they drip around the actual food. Do you know what I mean? When they,

341
00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.570
when they drip like red, like election around the food.

342
00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:01.100
That's what blueberry pie inside.

343
00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:05.150
<v 1>Look at those beautiful blueberries. Are you nuts? Again? Apple is great.</v>

344
00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.430
It's beautiful looking car. You buy, you know what you do.

345
00:20:07.431 --> 00:20:09.680
You know how you get apples? This there's so many apples.

346
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:13.520
We can stand to chop down half the Apple trees and we still be fine. You go,

347
00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.970
you go with your friend, Apple picking. It's like 99 cents for the family.

348
00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:21.290
Take as many as you can hold. That's how you do Apple picking. They're like,

349
00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:25.010
please take the apples from the farm. Come on in. We're doing deals.

350
00:20:25.011 --> 00:20:29.060
It's the whole family. Everyone take buck. They give you baskets in buckets.

351
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:33.920
They say, take as many as you can bring home. It's not a special fruits.

352
00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:38.270
A blueberry is special fruit. A beautiful cherry is a special fruit.

353
00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:41.960
<v 2>Arguing. The value of a blueberry or a peach or cherry.</v>

354
00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.160
<v 1>Value of the pie version off with the Apple enough.</v>

355
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:49.570
It's a better blueberry pie is not.

356
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.570
Do you put a better example is not a better pilot American cheese on it.

357
00:20:52.571 --> 00:20:54.730
Like a real garbage plate. Do you do that?

358
00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:58.690
Put on what blueberry pie people do that, you know, American cheese,

359
00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:02.260
you've never heard of this. People put a melted slice of American cheese.

360
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:05.920
Now they don't. I almost wear my own mouth.

361
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:09.490
So I swear on my life, people melt American cheese.

362
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:10.463
<v 3>Blueberry pie.</v>

363
00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:15.090
They a hundred percent do that right there pie with cheese,

364
00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:18.960
ancient tradition or an Alamo, but that's not blueberry. That's Apple

365
00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:26.910
now that's peach. I think you could find out by clicking. Oh,

366
00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:30.390
it is Apple. It is Apple, Apple milk, cheese on pie. It's disgusting.

367
00:21:30.391 --> 00:21:32.130
That is gross.

368
00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.990
<v 1>It's disgust. I guess it's sweet. Savory. Is that the deal? It's disgusting. My,</v>

369
00:21:35.991 --> 00:21:36.824
my friend.

370
00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.420
<v 3>Blueberry pie. That's one of the reasons I always hated, but I mean,</v>

371
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:40.830
it keeps coming up with Apple buddy.

372
00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:42.720
<v 1>That's uh, that's it that's I mean,</v>

373
00:21:42.721 --> 00:21:46.740
that's a crash single dropped right on top of your it's disgracing your pie.

374
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:51.510
It's hard. I mean, and by the way, with Googling, Googling,

375
00:21:51.511 --> 00:21:54.300
blueberry pie, American cheese,

376
00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.610
and only Apple pies are coming up.

377
00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:01.350
<v 3>Just because some animal put this block.</v>

378
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.330
<v 1>Cheese on pie should have cheese with fig and cheese with grape, you know,</v>

379
00:22:06.331 --> 00:22:08.700
like on a, on a platter. So I guess I good cheese.

380
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:12.480
<v 3>Fruit is tremendous. Yeah, that's true. But,</v>

381
00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:14.670
but not like that, dude.

382
00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.990
<v 1>It's a different cheesecake is great. You might have to dabble in a little, uh,</v>

383
00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:23.400
marijuana and see if that works brother. I've had it. It's disgusting.

384
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:27.770
Really doesn't taste. Right? Cause he's a garbage person. He's a garbage person.

385
00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:28.380
He's going to prove.

386
00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.180
<v 3>It through and through. That's how he is.</v>

387
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.350
<v 1>I mean, I I'm just letting you know a peach is a special fruit.</v>

388
00:22:34.351 --> 00:22:37.910
I mean Apple it's Apple juice. It's Apple cider. It's Apple.

389
00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:39.840
It's Apple juice.

390
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:44.790
<v 3>We've discussed an Apple juice is the best juice we've discussed it all my God,</v>

391
00:22:44.791 --> 00:22:45.624
please stop.

392
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:49.290
<v 1>What I love. We've discussed. It nothing's happened. You love Martinelli's.</v>

393
00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:50.730
They take nothing away from the Apple juice,

394
00:22:50.731 --> 00:22:53.970
but he just calls it the best juice. What do you think? Tops, Apple juice.

395
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.200
I mean a fresh squeezed orange juice. My friend Apple juice could take a walk.

396
00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:01.650
Apple juice causes children's teeth to rot and fall out and they look weird.

397
00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:06.330
You're talking about hacky and you're saying orange juice. There's a reason.

398
00:23:06.331 --> 00:23:09.210
It's the best juice. There's a reason. There's a reason.

399
00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:13.200
It's the reason Apple pie. Please Mark it down. Please Mark it down.

400
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:18.420
Let's go. Let's come back to it because you're bat. I'm not even,

401
00:23:18.421 --> 00:23:23.110
I love Apple juice. I love it. But I couldn't have it every day. Orange juice,

402
00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:23.910
crazy.

403
00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:28.170
You know what I want to have with my breakfast now doing with now doing another

404
00:23:28.171 --> 00:23:32.100
episode, we had to go back, hold on, just hold your, told your tongue.

405
00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.530
I was like, worried. Like I was like, Oh,

406
00:23:34.531 --> 00:23:35.970
are we going to find like more of a sense?

407
00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:40.530
It's like coming out as we're doing these. I got, I got a lot to say juice.

408
00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:44.490
Okay. No, but no, not now. No. I'm not going to hold your tongue.

409
00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:49.010
Where are we a time Mike? Okay. All right. Let's let's go to the polls.

410
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.720
So we don't go over again and let's see where it's at because I want to have the

411
00:23:53.721 --> 00:23:57.290
time to read some comments. So we'll say, I believe,

412
00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:01.100
I believe that you're going to win this one because Apple pie is Americano and

413
00:24:01.101 --> 00:24:03.980
it's all traditional and it's and it is, it is out there.

414
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.950
That's not right. That's a one vote, one vote,

415
00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:13.670
but they did what the other guy did with the, uh, that he did the same thing.

416
00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:17.600
The everything bagel guy did, unless we go, okay, here we go, babe.

417
00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:22.403
<v 3>Ooh,</v>

418
00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:27.010
hard to shake.

419
00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:31.990
<v 1>You to be hard to shake. This is like a bombing in front of your parents.</v>

420
00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:35.950
Are you? So you're about to eat humble pie. Oh my God.

421
00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:38.920
<v 3>Ooh. But I knew.</v>

422
00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:43.990
<v 1>I knew it was five, but I want to see that's like saying Yankees versus like,</v>

423
00:24:43.991 --> 00:24:48.160
you know, don't you backpedal now take your medicine.

424
00:24:48.161 --> 00:24:52.030
What was the number? 6,000, approximately 6,000 votes here.

425
00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.610
So far you got to Apple.

426
00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:01.120
<v 3>86, 1486.</v>

427
00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:05.230
<v 1>14 By a landslide. I mean, I knew it was going to win.</v>

428
00:25:05.231 --> 00:25:09.430
I think a wind by that much. Holy. But you're in America. Dude,

429
00:25:09.431 --> 00:25:12.160
go to Europe and, go, go, go somewhere else and ask,

430
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:16.990
do you hear me make these excuses gloat globally as go, go hear these excuses.

431
00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:19.450
But yeah, you're right. When I was in Italy,

432
00:25:19.451 --> 00:25:21.250
they couldn't start talking about the peach pies,

433
00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:25.900
but a baseball's America's pastime.

434
00:25:25.901 --> 00:25:30.430
And so his Apple pie is associated with Americana. So I had no,

435
00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:34.840
I knew I was never winning there. I didn't think it'd be 86, 14 Apple pie,

436
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:35.703
Apple tart.

437
00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:39.880
The only place I've ever seen peach cobbler is in a Vegas buffet.

438
00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:42.810
<v 3>Hey, it's not a good.</v>

439
00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:47.920
<v 1>You're insane. I'm not in it. Just because you choose to eat pie like.</v>

440
00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.630
He goes, peach pies are disgusting.

441
00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:57.400
I had one at a Vegas buffet making my point for them.

442
00:25:57.401 --> 00:26:00.640
I just go to your local, go to your local person who died,

443
00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:04.420
who go to a dynamite pie. Point me to go to a pie, man. Do you want a pie man?

444
00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.510
There's people. There's so many good pie places in the city. Listen to me,

445
00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:10.480
I'm saying, I'm not saying I've only eaten from bake for face.

446
00:26:10.481 --> 00:26:14.800
I'm thinking the only place I ever even come across it is it is at a buffet in

447
00:26:14.801 --> 00:26:17.470
Vegas. Well, you, I don't know what you're doing with your life,

448
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.480
but go into a nice bakery in New York city.

449
00:26:19.481 --> 00:26:21.640
The place where you live and don't pay,

450
00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:26.320
don't pay seven 99 on Fremont street and complained to me about the,

451
00:26:26.321 --> 00:26:29.470
about the quality of peach you're getting. Okay. I do wonder,

452
00:26:29.471 --> 00:26:33.640
I do wonder if I would have went cherry or blueberry cause I could have gone.

453
00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:37.330
I do wonder if they would've fared any, but I bet you had cherry pie.

454
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:41.650
I bet your cherry pie would have fared better. I might want to revisit.

455
00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.450
I want right match. And I take a different pot.

456
00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:49.100
<v 2>You against cherry apples. My number one,</v>

457
00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:51.500
but cherry is so valid.

458
00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:56.860
<v 1>There has to be. The episode should have been cherry. What makes this cherry? I,</v>

459
00:26:56.861 --> 00:26:59.540
I, I should've picked cherry point is no, no, no.

460
00:26:59.541 --> 00:27:01.610
I'm going to not be able to sleep tonight now because this was a,

461
00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:05.300
this was a waste. I need it. I need contenders.

462
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:07.100
I'm saying we wouldn't have had an episode.

463
00:27:07.101 --> 00:27:10.520
If you picked cherry part of what had been closer, might've been 60,

464
00:27:10.521 --> 00:27:11.840
40 might have been by about a one.

465
00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:15.350
<v 2>The point is, is I don't dislike cherry in any way. I love cheese.</v>

466
00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:18.740
<v 1>I understand. But I can't disparage it in any way. Whereas,</v>

467
00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.610
whereas I gotta be in the mood for an Apple. I also disparaged Apple. Yeah.

468
00:27:22.611 --> 00:27:25.070
You had, you had a, you had a thing about Apple. You didn't like it.

469
00:27:25.071 --> 00:27:25.904
It's like I'll eat it.

470
00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:29.570
<v 2>Oreo and I'll all over it. But you know, before I eat it though.</v>

471
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:32.090
<v 1>Yeah. You said you wouldn't cross the street, but I'm not always going to win.</v>

472
00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:35.870
I'm not always going to not cross the street for one. You know what I'm saying?

473
00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.350
There's some cherry pie. You like, you just like Apple more.

474
00:27:39.351 --> 00:27:40.220
So it wouldn't have been a kid.

475
00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:45.320
<v 2>I love cherry pie. I love Apple pie. Apple pie to me is the all time.</v>

476
00:27:45.321 --> 00:27:46.460
Great cherry is.

477
00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:49.570
<v 1>I'm gonna have a shot because if I would've chose cherry, we wouldn't have,</v>

478
00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:51.350
we wouldn't have, there would have been no debate. We're sitting here.

479
00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:55.550
<v 2>Two delicious pies. And you would have said the mean. You said about Apple pie.</v>

480
00:27:55.551 --> 00:27:58.490
And I would've said I can't insult cherry pie. I love it.

481
00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.650
Now if you pick blueberry,

482
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:04.790
I would add even more to say that I said about peach because that's a.

483
00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:08.510
<v 3>You know, we'll read two comments.</v>

484
00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:11.060
I can't even read some comments.

485
00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:16.610
Whoever says peach should be arrested.

486
00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:27.410
Okay. Well I'm just going to write back. Well all alright.

487
00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:28.723
We got.

488
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:33.140
<v 1>Uh, okay. The clear winner is Apple, but I can't stand a cooked Apple.</v>

489
00:28:33.141 --> 00:28:34.190
So it's peach for me.

490
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.710
<v 3>Uh.</v>

491
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:40.730
<v 1>I love Apple pie, but only cold. I need peach for sample comments. People.</v>

492
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.940
When we start looking at the podcast and you ever see the Twitter poll,

493
00:28:43.941 --> 00:28:48.920
come out, please don't deviate and apply your reasoning to this. Just,

494
00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:50.270
we want to hear your comments,

495
00:28:50.271 --> 00:28:54.200
but you want to hear them about the singular two things that are going head to

496
00:28:54.201 --> 00:28:58.760
head, please, please. All the buddies out there. The taste buddies please.

497
00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.840
<v 2>Good. We all right. We just named the audience. Uh, look at this,</v>

498
00:29:02.841 --> 00:29:04.850
this comment right here. I went.

499
00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:08.420
<v 1>With peach. That being said, I've never had peach pie.</v>

500
00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:10.070
That's how much she did tests.

501
00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:13.580
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

502
00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:17.450
<v 1>But my sight unseen blinds. What the hell is peach pie?</v>

503
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:20.960
<v 3>Not a product that you find anywhere. It's my</v>

504
00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:30.650
peach pie is a pie.

505
00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.910
<v 1>Okay. Apple pie for sure. But peach cobbler, beats, Apple pie.</v>

506
00:29:34.911 --> 00:29:39.440
Any day I told you about the cobbler. I told you about it Apple,

507
00:29:39.441 --> 00:29:44.080
but only because there was no peak can. Okay. I don't need that Apple pie,

508
00:29:44.081 --> 00:29:48.010
but peach cobbler. There you go. So Apple pie, hands down. No question.

509
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:52.390
I chose peach, but typically peach comes in a cobbler form. Not a pie.

510
00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.160
This is where I might've went wrong, buddy.

511
00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:57.600
<v 2>I should've put up peach cobbler against Apple pie. No.</v>

512
00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:00.360
<v 1>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I could have done that.</v>

513
00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:04.080
<v 2>Not pie cause there's Apple cobbler too. And I don't,</v>

514
00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:08.730
I'm not a big Apple cobbler guy. Either. Some guy wrote once again,

515
00:30:08.731 --> 00:30:12.150
this isn't even close, but whoever said Pete should go to jail.

516
00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:16.350
Uh, yeah.

517
00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:18.720
<v 1>Yeah, no, this guy look at this. Um,</v>

518
00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:24.780
you must go to Matta tuck long Island and try the peach

519
00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:28.170
or any cream pie at this farm stand. You will remember it.

520
00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:32.820
Bremer Briere Bree or mirror for your mere farms.

521
00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:35.850
<v 2>The winter, the winter response is this year.</v>

522
00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:39.240
<v 1>Should we pick a winning response every week? We should. Should we do that?</v>

523
00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:42.750
And just call them out. We'll just give a shout out. So people have it like,

524
00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.790
you know, and you've got to play by the game.

525
00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:46.770
<v 2>Rules though. That's the winner, right? This one,</v>

526
00:30:46.771 --> 00:30:50.910
she put the gift up from American pie when he sticks his finger in the Apple pie

527
00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:51.803
and it sticks in it.

528
00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.530
<v 1>Okay. So that's kind of new set, new thing. At the end,</v>

529
00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:59.610
we are going to crown the best comment, uh, on this. And we will see,

530
00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.640
we will call out your Twitter handle and, and call you out.

531
00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:05.910
I will say little rules. It should be strictly about the comment,

532
00:31:05.911 --> 00:31:09.720
a comment on one of the two things we did not like what you think that you would

533
00:31:09.721 --> 00:31:13.950
do with another PI? Uh, no, it doesn't help to be. It doesn't help.

534
00:31:13.951 --> 00:31:16.800
If it's funny, it doesn't not help. If it's like, what am I trying to say?

535
00:31:16.801 --> 00:31:17.700
I think I'm having a stroke.

536
00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.620
<v 2>I know what you're saying. I know what you're saying.</v>

537
00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.360
Do you agree that that's the winner or no?

538
00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:24.840
<v 1>Uh, what the hell the hell is a peach pie?</v>

539
00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:28.260
<v 2>I mean, what the hell is a peach pie is a great one to that.</v>

540
00:31:28.261 --> 00:31:30.870
That might be my favorite actually. I'm sorry to get the other person.

541
00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:37.350
<v 1>Real Sal, really peach. Be better. Peach SMH.</v>

542
00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:39.023
Shaking. My head.

543
00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:41.250
<v 2>Apple is overrated says this person.</v>

544
00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:48.870
<v 1>Cancel the poll. All correct answers are in. And they did the 100%. Yeah.</v>

545
00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.600
Yeah. I'm not. I mean, I'm, I'm,

546
00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.370
I'm having a hard time finding people to back me with the peach. Yeah.

547
00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:58.290
It is getting kicked out of me. I'm having a hard time. Uh.

548
00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.790
<v 2>Wow man. It is getting.</v>

549
00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:06.300
<v 1>Wow. This person says definitely 90% of these people.</v>

550
00:32:06.301 --> 00:32:10.560
Haven't tried my grandma's peach pie and there's a peach pie emoji. Thank you.

551
00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.900
<v 2>I mean, but again, it's this like,</v>

552
00:32:12.901 --> 00:32:16.170
it's this like completely tiny narrow window.

553
00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:17.910
Like you've never had the peach pie.

554
00:32:17.911 --> 00:32:20.910
The one person I know that makes it makes it's like, yeah, no.

555
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:24.450
You know what I mean? It's like, nobody's going, Oh,

556
00:32:24.451 --> 00:32:27.360
the peach pie at Denny's is great. Nobody's saying it.

557
00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:32.490
<v 1>Again where you get your pie spice. You are the love cool whip.</v>

558
00:32:32.491 --> 00:32:33.600
And you like going to Vegas,

559
00:32:33.601 --> 00:32:37.290
buffets and Denny's and then you take a on trader Joe's, everything, bagel,

560
00:32:37.291 --> 00:32:40.190
seasoning, anything. I'm just going broad.

561
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:41.270
<v 2>And just making a comment.</v>

562
00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.540
McDonald's most popular restaurant chain in the entire country.

563
00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:47.690
You'll find an Apple pie. McDonald's you'll never see a peach pie.

564
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:51.200
House of pies was the name of a restaurant.

565
00:32:51.201 --> 00:32:54.320
When I lived in LA that I used to go to every Saturday morning,

566
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:56.240
they never had peach pie.

567
00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:02.680
<v 1>Peach, Carla, we met. I mean, I really just, I'm not gonna be able to let,</v>

568
00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:03.910
I'm not gonna be able to sleep tonight.

569
00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:08.170
As in anything other than Apple is just unAmerican. That latches onto me.

570
00:33:08.171 --> 00:33:10.510
They're voting for America here. Not the pie. Uh,

571
00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:14.410
answers are paid for big Apple has their hand in this poll. Let's big.

572
00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.820
Apple has their hand in this poll.

573
00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:17.860
<v 2>Let's crown the winner. I think what the,</v>

574
00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:21.520
I think the hell was peach pie is the winner. Uh,

575
00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:25.450
and that comes to us from Handel at reel.
