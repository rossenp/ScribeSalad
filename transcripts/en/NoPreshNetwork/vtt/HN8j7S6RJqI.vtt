00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.570
<v 0>Taste buds. They come into the mic, talking about the food.</v>

2
00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:06.750
They hate talking about the food they like to, fool's gonna FAPE it.

3
00:00:06.751 --> 00:00:11.250
Only one food Tenby rate, taste buds, man, coming to them. I come shock and say,

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.130
taste, bud.

5
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.740
<v 1>What's up. Tastes buddies. It's the taste buds podcast.</v>

6
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.960
I'm Joe DeRosa of salvo Canada. We're here to debate some food today.

7
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.910
Oh my God. Today we have a humdinger. I can't,

8
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.290
I'm gonna wait. I'm gonna wait till we get to it because we'll,

9
00:00:30.291 --> 00:00:33.920
let's just warm up a little bit first. What's the conversation to two right now.

10
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.570
It's two, two right now, right? Yeah. We've done four episodes you want to?

11
00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:42.470
I want to, okay. And after this episode I will have one, three,

12
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.740
and this is one where I will say you're coming out confident and you have good

13
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.570
reason to be, but these are two heavyweights that we're debating tonight.

14
00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:54.200
It's a heavyweight. It's not really. I took a, I did bed with the peach,

15
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.820
with the peach pie. Should have the cherry pie.

16
00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:57.830
We all said that we all know that. Uh,

17
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.980
I don't know that I would have accepted the challenge we had had been cherry

18
00:01:00.981 --> 00:01:03.410
pie. You still would have won with Apple there's no, no.

19
00:01:03.411 --> 00:01:05.660
One's going to beat Apple. No one, but I do.

20
00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:07.880
I do have an admiration for cherry pie. Well,

21
00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:10.550
we've we don't need to get into it, but here's the point.

22
00:01:10.551 --> 00:01:14.240
It's not always something we hate. It's just our preference. But if we hate it,

23
00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:15.200
it's even better. Yeah.

24
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.830
So I don't want to announce just yet what we're debating today. Okay.

25
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.630
Let's just have some friendly food talk.

26
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.990
We were just talking before we started rolling the, uh, uh,

27
00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:28.220
the concept of bringing food to bed. Oh yeah. I sit in my thirties.

28
00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:30.740
I often brought food to bed and would fall asleep with it.

29
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.260
Now when I was in my thirties, this is what I want to tell you. Yeah.

30
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.270
Every night, not every night, but five nights a week, I would go out.

31
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.050
I'd get hammered with my buddies at a comedy club, whatever we were doing.

32
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.890
And then on the way home, I would get a cheese steak,

33
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.770
sometimes double meat from the deli,

34
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.290
a Nemo's chocolate cake square and a Coke,

35
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.220
you know, and, and, and all, and probably chips.

36
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.510
You see that to me now? And I'm like, Oh my God, my insight.

37
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.060
And I would lay in my bed. I'd put my TV on. I'd lay in my bed. I mean,

38
00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:11.210
it's a feast for a King. Yeah. Just faced and I'd eat it.

39
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.080
I'd get through a lot of it. Okay. Do you want all of it? No,

40
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.260
my go-to us please. Well, first of all, like in oncology,

41
00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:21.620
I worked at a pizzeria as a delivery guy. So at the end of the night,

42
00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:23.150
we didn't throw the pizza and I took it home.

43
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.850
I work working three nights a week, four nights a week.

44
00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:29.270
I used to come home with like two pies and then I just keep it in the fridge.

45
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.610
And whoever came up with the cold pizza, I just lived off of it.

46
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.330
My go-to when I bartended for a long time. And I used to like, come home.

47
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.020
I only place open when like these bodegas or convenience stores, 24 hours.

48
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.820
So I didn't have like really cheese steak available to me and my late night

49
00:02:43.821 --> 00:02:47.090
drunk. Or was it? Yeah, I guess sometimes I was drinking,

50
00:02:47.091 --> 00:02:49.130
but this was my go-to snack. And let me tell you,

51
00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:53.630
I didn't realize how bad it was for me then, but it helped me just pack on some,

52
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.610
some mass, give it to me.

53
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.330
Cream, cheese, everything bagel,

54
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.810
a pint of Tropicana orange juice. Okay. All right.

55
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.710
And the hostess black cupcakes with the white on the ice

56
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.580
cream in the middle, the cream in the middle, but chocolate,

57
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.520
everything chocolate, except the swirl of white with the cream in the middle.

58
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.410
That was my boom, boom, boom.

59
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:24.820
Like I would go home after a night and I just be like, I can't wait to eat.

60
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.690
Or like I was going to eat a Michelin ranked meal. You look at that thing.

61
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.670
It's often imitated, but rarely duplicated. I haven't had it.

62
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:37.930
I've even had it like some really like some, uh, bakeries try to make it.

63
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.480
And they don't even make it as good. But although I will say like,

64
00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:44.380
everything else that's topped off in quality. And I don't, I mean,

65
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.750
I don't mean anything shatter, shout out hostess, but.

66
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.140
<v 2>Uh, look, that's a heavy, heavy carb sugar meal, which I see.</v>

67
00:03:52.141 --> 00:03:55.950
My thing was always like my late night thing, we had the Nemos.

68
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.630
<v 1>The Coca-Cola I would send a.</v>

69
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.090
<v 2>Cheese thing and Doritos I would set up. No, no, no.</v>

70
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.350
But I would set up something that felt more like a dinner. Like it was like,

71
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.340
you know what I mean?

72
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.960
<v 1>Yeah. But you have a heroes, uh, heroes worth of bread. Yeah. Besides the thing.</v>

73
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.320
<v 2>Surprised at the lack of meat involved in your meetings?</v>

74
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.000
<v 1>Well, I was, I mean, this was, I was, you know,</v>

75
00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:17.400
four 30 in the morning at the deli. Well, I wasn't,

76
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.550
I wasn't going to have them chop me up.

77
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.400
<v 2>I was, I'm saying, I'm saying you're more of a sweets kind of guy, I think.</v>

78
00:04:26.401 --> 00:04:28.350
And I was a little more in the direction of, uh.

79
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.810
<v 1>I dunno, pounding a hot foot, long cheese steak at 5:00 AM. I'm not above it,</v>

80
00:04:33.811 --> 00:04:36.630
but I just think like a nice everything bagel hit, hit the spot a little more.

81
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.410
<v 2>A little more. Uh, why, why though?</v>

82
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.253
Is it, did she say.

83
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.370
<v 1>Heavy for you at that time? Right before bed,</v>

84
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:48.780
right before bed.

85
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.610
<v 2>You don't have the, you don't have the balls.</v>

86
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.570
<v 1>It's a bit much. It's going to repeat on me. Of course. I was already going in.</v>

87
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.260
I was already dipping a big toe in with the, with the OJ. I now sleep.

88
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.370
I don't go anywhere. I don't leave my house without a writing utensil. Uh,

89
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.330
a pen or pencil. And Tom, how much OJ? That's just a 16 ounce,

90
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.880
16 ounce. Which by the way, I don't know if they sell those anymore.

91
00:05:11.881 --> 00:05:12.930
You know what my problem with that?

92
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.220
<v 2>Yeah, no, we'll get to it in a plastic bottle or the cardboard carton. Yeah,</v>

93
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.600
the plastic Tropicana's.

94
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.370
<v 1>Oh, no, not, I mean, not from concentrate. No. You give me concentrate.</v>

95
00:05:23.371 --> 00:05:26.850
Orange juice. Literally. I'll I'll slap your mother in the mouth. Really? Yes.

96
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.713
Really? You.

97
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.030
<v 2>Like orange juice. We're going to get to that. It's.</v>

98
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.550
<v 1>My favorite drink of all time. Although I will say in the last,</v>

99
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.290
in the last five years, I rarely, rarely have it.

100
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.130
<v 2>Uh, I was also a pizza delivery, man. Okay. And I'll tell you.</v>

101
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.240
<v 1>I don't know if I said, did I say boy or man, but I just say whenever I say it,</v>

102
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.600
no, cause I was like in college, I was under the, I did a pizza delivery. Boy.

103
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.420
People don't normally say a pizza delivery on a pizza delivery guy.

104
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.460
The face of a man with the heart of a boy. Okay.

105
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.860
<v 2>Uh, I'll tell you my two greatest offensives uh,</v>

106
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.880
delivering food from the deli pizza slash deli place I worked at.

107
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.590
<v 1>Oh, there's your problem right there. First of all, what? Scott's yacht.</v>

108
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.100
I'm believable. What do you mean the pizza slash deli?

109
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.160
<v 2>No, it was a pizza shop that also sold like sandwiches and,</v>

110
00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.350
but just Italian sandwiches. And like they would make a Turkey club and stuff.

111
00:06:17.351 --> 00:06:20.950
Like, you know, like, like it looks at a pizzeria, that's all sandwiches pizza.

112
00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.110
<v 1>Was it a sandwich slash pizza place? I worked in both primarily. What was it?</v>

113
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.720
<v 2>I worked in both. I worked at a pizzeria that was primarily a pizzeria,</v>

114
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.850
also sold cheese steaks and a little bit of pasta and stuff like that.

115
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.480
That's fine.

116
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.930
That's and then I worked in a deli that didn't serve anything but sandwiches.

117
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.590
Okay.

118
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.960
<v 1>Okay. Because some of these delis try to get away with like,</v>

119
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.420
I see like these places, like the Jersey shore place or whatever,

120
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.010
they'll be like, yeah, we're a sub shop,

121
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.220
but we also make pizza or what have you it's like, you don't really do both.

122
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.600
Well in Philly every year.

123
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.600
<v 2>Almost every pizza place, village pizza and subs.</v>

124
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.620
<v 1>Subs. You mean heroes? Right? Hoagies. We call them hoagies.</v>

125
00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.070
But you mean eggplant, chicken, meatballs, peppers, and eggs.

126
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.600
Like meatball and cheese.

127
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.520
<v 2>Chicken, tuna, Turkey club, Italian, Italian, hoagie, Turkey,</v>

128
00:07:06.521 --> 00:07:10.090
hoagie. You know that stuff too. Yeah. I really,

129
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.100
I worked at a pizzeria that like.

130
00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.220
<v 1>Didn't really make like, we might've had a couple of,</v>

131
00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.860
but on Staten Island you worked in a pizzeria. Yeah.

132
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.710
We do it different in Philly. Yeah. I'm saying you do it wrong.

133
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.590
We G we do it better.

134
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.720
<v 2>Okay. Cause you can go into a pizza to, you.</v>

135
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.810
<v 1>Want to get, you want to, I want to get a hoagie at my favorite pizza.</v>

136
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:29.440
Why wouldn't.

137
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.600
<v 2>You want to get a hoagie at your favorite pizza.</v>

138
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:36.310
<v 1>Were on an Italian hero. That would be on an Italian menu, but not like a,</v>

139
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.580
you know, I'm not going to go in there and get something that's not like that.

140
00:07:39.581 --> 00:07:42.550
You could only get in like a, a delicatessen.

141
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.850
Well that I'm going to get a roast beef sandwich at my pizzeria.

142
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.230
<v 2>Here's what I'm offended by right now.</v>

143
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.990
You're talking as if these pizzerias are referring to are,

144
00:07:49.991 --> 00:07:54.190
these are these bodegas that we have here in the fine city.

145
00:07:54.191 --> 00:07:55.810
We live in over there. When you,

146
00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.890
I'm not talking about a bodega where you go in and they got a candy bar section

147
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.870
and there, and then a hohos section and then a,

148
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.720
in a coffee machine where I'm talking about,

149
00:08:04.721 --> 00:08:09.280
it's a pizzeria that also makes Sam that's D that's the two things they do

150
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.700
sandwiches. And I'm talking real sandwiches. I'm not talking.

151
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.110
Boar's head sliced and tossed them.

152
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:18.520
<v 1>Oh God, let me shout out. Boy's head though. I love Boar's head. Yeah.</v>

153
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:22.060
<v 2>Talking about you get a real Italian sandwich. Okay. I don't think, you know,</v>

154
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:28.150
I mean, I [inaudible] for five years. I did too.

155
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.270
Okay. This is very sensitive territory for me. Okay. Listen, you want in,

156
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.020
you you're stepping on my story too,

157
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:38.110
because I was just going to tell you a funny story and you felt the need to go

158
00:08:38.111 --> 00:08:39.850
in and take, start taking Shapot shots.

159
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.730
<v 1>I didn't know you, you told me at the top of this thing,</v>

160
00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:45.430
you got competitive and you said I'm going down. You are, and you set the tone.

161
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.850
You are. I can't. I could be on your side. I could be your ally.

162
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.250
<v 2>Yeah. It could be your enemy. You want to hear the story? Yes.</v>

163
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:52.900
My greatest defense is delivery.

164
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:57.330
Tell me one time for the pizza place. Uh,

165
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:01.560
somebody ordered fried mushrooms. They were mushrooms in breading. That was it.

166
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.560
And uh, I dropped them on the way to the car.

167
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:09.330
They rolled out of the styrofoam through an, uh, uh,

168
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:13.260
an oil stain on the macadam. I picked them up, put them back.

169
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:14.460
It didn't say anything.

170
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.070
Somebody might be dead on my watch. I don't even know.

171
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.560
<v 1>I can't even laugh at it. I'm mortified.</v>

172
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:32.090
That means that, that means that it's happening to everybody. Because if you,

173
00:09:32.091 --> 00:09:35.170
if you're out there other people like you are out there. I mean, I wouldn't,

174
00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.820
I would have, I mean, I would have went back to the place and be like, look,

175
00:09:37.821 --> 00:09:38.654
I dropped it. You know.

176
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:43.640
<v 2>I didn't, I couldn't face getting screamed at, but oil stained.</v>

177
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:49.520
Oh, Oh guys. It's okay. It was just a stain, you know,

178
00:09:49.521 --> 00:09:54.500
like on a parking lot. Uh, no, no. I know on the ground we were,

179
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.980
so we were so behind and I was already getting grief from my boss.

180
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.240
<v 1>I know. I know when you're in the weeds, you don't want to go back. I'd done it.</v>

181
00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:05.870
I, I, I w I had bad events. I would take like,

182
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.870
sometimes when it was just dinners and not pizzas, or even pizzas, but dinners,

183
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:10.820
we put it in like the cheese boxes, like,

184
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.010
and so we'd have like a carrying case and I'd like,

185
00:10:13.011 --> 00:10:16.790
go to get in the car and go to put the thing on the roof, then open the car.

186
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.870
And then at one time, I, one time I put it on the roof, got in the car,

187
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.960
drove to the place. Then I got there. I knew where I was going.

188
00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.170
And I looked in the car and I was like, Oh my God, I didn't right.

189
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.770
I forgot to bring the food. So I'm like, Oh my God,

190
00:10:30.771 --> 00:10:32.420
I gotta go all the way back and come back and I'll be late.

191
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.010
So I'll just get in my car and I just drive back. But as I'm driving back, um,

192
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:41.480
there's a two lane highway, uh, street over the expressway.

193
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.960
And so you go back one way and you come back the other way and I'm driving.

194
00:10:44.961 --> 00:10:49.430
And I see just like, like Burt Hawks, seagulls,

195
00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:53.570
just in the middle of the street, just descending down like 15 birds.

196
00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.590
And I'm looking at Trav and I go, that is the people's entire meal.

197
00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:01.340
It was on my roof. And it fell off over there. And by the time I got back,

198
00:11:01.341 --> 00:11:02.174
they attacked it.

199
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:07.310
<v 2>Because my second offense was the same thing.</v>

200
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.220
You left it on the roof club sandwich from the deli, drove off,

201
00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:15.080
saw the styrofoam fly off of my roof in front of my windshield.

202
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:20.390
It tumbled opened up on the ground. Okay. Now,

203
00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:24.260
now the sandwich stayed in the styrofoam, but it was, it was disasters

204
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.630
you, by the way, beep that this was a place. I said effort earlier to a beep.

205
00:11:32.631 --> 00:11:37.070
It, uh, this was a place where you really got screamed at, like, if you like.

206
00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.500
<v 1>But there's also a matter of public seat.</v>

207
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:41.540
<v 2>Health case. So what I did was I picked it up.</v>

208
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.980
I reassembled the sandwich would touch the ground. It did touch the ground.

209
00:11:45.981 --> 00:11:49.880
I fixed the sandwich. I close on your hood. No, no, no.

210
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:53.590
The container hit the ground, but the sandwich stayed in the, like,

211
00:11:53.591 --> 00:11:57.430
it never came out of the container. So I fixed a sandwich in the street.

212
00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:01.960
I closed the container. The container has now black scuffs on it.

213
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.790
And I see my hand to God, gravel stones are stuck in it.

214
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.490
And then I'm picking out I deliver it,

215
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:14.260
but I was delivering to a business. So the lady that who was four,

216
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:17.110
like she didn't get it. Like I left it at the front desk and then.

217
00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:21.060
<v 1>The money was there. Uh, I leave it. I think I got away with bloody murder.</v>

218
00:12:21.061 --> 00:12:25.320
I drive back. I walk into the deli and my boss looks at me and he goes,

219
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.380
what the hell did you do to that club sandwich?

220
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:29.423
<v 2>They called,</v>

221
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:37.350
I'll tell you. I told her, I told this story at a podcast.

222
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.950
<v 1>Um, I don't remember where I bought, uh,</v>

223
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.380
the worst thing I ever did in the only time I ever did it here,

224
00:12:43.381 --> 00:12:45.510
I am giving you guff. Um,

225
00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:48.900
I had a lady that used to order the same thing,

226
00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:52.320
every like every couple afternoons. And when you had a day shift,

227
00:12:52.321 --> 00:12:55.980
it was already slow and she owes your daughter on my day shift. Uh,

228
00:12:55.981 --> 00:12:59.220
and she lived, I was gonna say the address. I want me to say the address.

229
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.530
And she ordered a regular slice,

230
00:13:01.531 --> 00:13:05.580
a Sicilian slice and a can of Coca-Cola classic. And it was four 95.

231
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.013
Okay.

232
00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:10.440
And every day I would deliver it to our two slices in a paper bag with a can of

233
00:13:10.441 --> 00:13:13.620
Coca-Cola and ring the bell. She takes forever to get to the door.

234
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:17.160
And then when she got to the door, she'd open the door and like, be like, Oh,

235
00:13:17.161 --> 00:13:19.050
Hey, how are you? Am I good?

236
00:13:19.051 --> 00:13:22.860
And I would give her it and she'd give me exactly four 95.

237
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:27.810
She wouldn't give me a $5 bill. Even she would give me four 95.

238
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.110
So she didn't tip me a red cent. And it was annoying.

239
00:13:31.111 --> 00:13:32.520
And I just didn't like her. And she had a,

240
00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.190
she had a treadmill in our house and all she did was hang her clothes on it.

241
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:39.000
Right? Yeah. Full disclosure. So I was like,

242
00:13:39.001 --> 00:13:43.290
this is not happening for like months. And one time I got so upset with her.

243
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:49.110
So what'd you do? All right.

244
00:13:49.111 --> 00:13:51.570
So one time I go, that was a deep silence.

245
00:13:51.571 --> 00:13:53.160
You just gave you listen to something real bad.

246
00:13:53.161 --> 00:13:57.840
One time I go there and she gives me a Manila envelope, like the big ones,

247
00:13:57.841 --> 00:14:01.350
like a letter size. And she goes, I'm so sorry. Um,

248
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.380
I looked around and I didn't have, uh,

249
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.980
like I didn't have the money and I didn't couldn't find the bills.

250
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:11.790
So I just put it like in change. And she goes here and she goes,

251
00:14:11.791 --> 00:14:14.520
but I did put something in there for you. She said those words,

252
00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.010
exactly like that. She was just something in there for you.

253
00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:19.740
I'm holding this thing. It's five pounds. It's it's it feels like,

254
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:23.400
like three pounds. Excuse my cursing. Again, three pounds,

255
00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.970
three pounds. I open it.

256
00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:33.300
It's only pennies only. So I said, do you know why?

257
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.360
Because my boss used to be a delivery minimum. So he's not,

258
00:14:36.361 --> 00:14:38.550
I'm not getting hung out to dry, but he would,

259
00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.800
he wouldn't enforce it with this woman. Right. So I'm like,

260
00:14:40.801 --> 00:14:43.260
now I'm going to show my boss, her true colors. Yeah.

261
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.560
So I go and I walk up and I'm walking around, I'm in the envelope.

262
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:47.491
He's standing behind the counter.

263
00:14:47.491 --> 00:14:50.490
And I walked out of the counter under the sign and he goes, what's that?

264
00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:53.210
And I open and I just, don't 500 pennies on the couch.

265
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:57.830
I dropped down to pennies on the counter and he goes, what is that? And I go,

266
00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.380
it's the lady you make me deliver it to everyday. They've never tipped me.

267
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:04.640
And he goes, I've never, he goes, I I've, I've never in my entire life. And my,

268
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.280
this entire business run ever seen anything like this in my life. I go,

269
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:10.400
I told you, and then I start to count that he's like, don't count it.

270
00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.290
And he goes, I'm going to tell, I'm going to call her on the phone.

271
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:15.590
I'm going to say, we're going to return it back. I can't use this money.

272
00:15:15.591 --> 00:15:18.240
And just to pay me when she has it. Okay. So he gets on the phone.

273
00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:21.830
He tells him I counted it just because I want to see. Cause she said,

274
00:15:21.831 --> 00:15:25.880
there's something in there for you. Right? Four 95. There was 500 pennies. Yeah,

275
00:15:25.881 --> 00:15:29.330
I know. And it's a shame. She left me five. I let it slip.

276
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:33.040
<v 2>Let's slip early. You blew it early. That's a shame. I haven't told the story.</v>

277
00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.340
<v 1>That's okay. No, I know. I let it go. We can beep it then.</v>

278
00:15:36.341 --> 00:15:39.100
And then you can act like you can, now this whole thing's going to be beat.

279
00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:45.460
All right. Yeah. 500. So I didn't tell you what I did. Oh,

280
00:15:45.461 --> 00:15:49.990
what'd you do next time she ordered what'd you do?

281
00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.000
I thought you were going to say like.

282
00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.280
<v 2>You spit in the pizza. Oh you did.</v>

283
00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:58.060
<v 1>I didn't reveal that you're giving me.</v>

284
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.790
It's only did it once only to this woman.

285
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:05.710
Only once I never did anything like that. You got cast deep.

286
00:16:05.711 --> 00:16:10.630
These curses, you got cast or motor oil in your friends. Turkey.

287
00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.750
That was under the gun. That was different. I didn't do it maliciously. I know.

288
00:16:13.751 --> 00:16:15.520
But you still did it. You made it, you made it.

289
00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.440
You knew what happened and you still proceed.

290
00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.260
<v 2>Spit in somebody's food. When somebody doesn't tip you,</v>

291
00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.350
you walk away muttering you're dirty under your breath.

292
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:28.720
<v 1>I never would have spit in her food, but when she tipped me five pennies,</v>

293
00:16:28.721 --> 00:16:33.570
it was the break. Gotcha. I just,

294
00:16:33.571 --> 00:16:36.670
you could go to jail for that. That's a [inaudible]. That's why I'm joking.

295
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:40.030
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's why I'm joking.

296
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.220
<v 2>Whatever the statute is, your pads who.</v>

297
00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:46.030
<v 1>I am. You're right. I am right. I spent right enough food, but I never did it.</v>

298
00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:47.710
I would never do that. I mean, look, you're talking to the,

299
00:16:47.711 --> 00:16:51.370
I am a pillar of excellence at every job I've ever done. I've taken some,

300
00:16:51.371 --> 00:16:55.150
I go the extra mile, go out of my way, bend over backwards customer always.

301
00:16:55.151 --> 00:16:57.310
Right. I teach, I taught my staff that when I,

302
00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.860
and I had it when I had my own place, never in my life,

303
00:16:59.861 --> 00:17:04.120
have I ever even peripherally visited that dark place in my mind,

304
00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:07.690
this woman was so annoying.

305
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:10.510
And then when she just hit me five pennies,

306
00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.600
yet I've already had delivered to our house. 50 times.

307
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:17.320
<v 2>She had something on your boss. She was, there was something I don't know.</v>

308
00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:22.090
<v 1>But I, my golf would be my boss ever sees this man. Cause I, I feel like I I'm,</v>

309
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:25.570
I, by selling it, I'm letting him down because I really take everything really.

310
00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:29.200
Like I really work like w when I do my job, no matter what it is,

311
00:17:29.201 --> 00:17:32.470
I try to really, really, I know. I know. And so look here,

312
00:17:32.471 --> 00:17:33.790
we all having a moment, right?

313
00:17:33.791 --> 00:17:35.710
I'm sharing this moment with people I'm sharing with, listen,

314
00:17:35.711 --> 00:17:40.600
this is vulnerable. I am ashamed of it. Yes. Would I do it today? No,

315
00:17:40.601 --> 00:17:44.530
I wouldn't do it today. Um, do I feel like I could have done it again? Uh,

316
00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:48.640
I mean, do I feel like I was justified back then now? It's probably never,

317
00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:50.100
I have.

318
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.630
<v 3>A clean bill of health. She's fine.</v>

319
00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:57.750
<v 1>I just, I, should I be ashamed right now? No. No,</v>

320
00:17:58.460 --> 00:17:59.293
because I'm judging you.

321
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:03.290
<v 3>Because it's fun to judge, but everybody is going to judge me now.</v>

322
00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:08.150
<v 1>At 18. Who cares? Yeah. Yeah. That's okay. I believe 18 is an adult.</v>

323
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:10.340
<v 2>It's fine. I wouldn't worry about it.</v>

324
00:18:10.341 --> 00:18:12.290
You think you're the first pizza got to spit in some ladies?

325
00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:15.710
<v 3>Probably not, but now, you know, you know, once you spit now,</v>

326
00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.000
all of a sudden I'm the guy that does that.

327
00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.310
<v 2>You're not the guy that does that.</v>

328
00:18:19.311 --> 00:18:21.530
I don't think anybody's going to think that you're the guy that does that.

329
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:25.910
<v 3>It's crossed my mind. And I've been in the food service industry, my whole life.</v>

330
00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:26.840
That was the only time.

331
00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:27.673
<v 1>Ever.</v>

332
00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.760
<v 2>Probably did something like that. Along the line, somewhere.</v>

333
00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:36.230
<v 3>Passive aggressive is giving me a Manila envelope with 500 pennies on it.</v>

334
00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:38.560
She's saying, going out of your way to.

335
00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:43.470
<v 1>Why now she's a lineup. She was a lunatic. So she thinks of five senses,</v>

336
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.433
not a sight.

337
00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:48.340
<v 2>Right? She's not saying talking as if you're dealing with the, you know, the,</v>

338
00:18:48.341 --> 00:18:52.640
the, the secretary of state or something it's alluded to. Okay. Okay.

339
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.150
<v 1>Well then, well, how do you feel about what I did then?</v>

340
00:18:56.750 --> 00:19:01.100
<v 2>I don't have a problem with it. It's just more fun to be judgmental. I mean,</v>

341
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.570
I think this guy would understand a podcast work by now. Yeah.

342
00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.740
Let's agree on everything.

343
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:10.400
<v 3>I do understand. That's why I'm doing it. I'm thinking of in deep here,</v>

344
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:11.720
I'm giving it.

345
00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.440
<v 2>I'm giving you stuff to bounce off. I'm bouncing, babe. I'm bouncing,</v>

346
00:19:15.441 --> 00:19:18.020
but let's get to it because I don't want to run out of time.

347
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:21.200
I want to get to the debate that you are going to.

348
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:25.280
<v 3>We might be like 20 minutes in already. Yeah.</v>

349
00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.960
<v 2>You wanna talk about a lunatic? You want to talk about a crazy person.</v>

350
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.900
Here's one right here. Here's a debate.

351
00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.480
Get ready to launch it on the Twitter folks.

352
00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:40.670
<v 1>We're ready for this debate. Best classic ice cream flavor,</v>

353
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:45.620
chocolate or vanilla tweet done. It's out.

354
00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.170
Why don't you tell the fine people? Which side.

355
00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:52.100
<v 3>I'll can tell you right now, chocolate as a flavor. I love it. I'm a chocoholic.</v>

356
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:53.150
I'm addicted to chocolate.

357
00:19:53.151 --> 00:19:56.570
I wished chocolate didn't exist because chocolate is put a lot of mass on my

358
00:19:56.571 --> 00:19:59.840
body. Personally. I love chocolate and a lot of different iterations.

359
00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.930
And I do not even mind chocolate ice cream flavors.

360
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:04.940
<v 2>Into this justification. When you.</v>

361
00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:08.240
<v 3>Go head to head and an ice cream flavor, chocolate versus vanilla,</v>

362
00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:12.020
I go vanilla 10 times out of 10, without a doubt.

363
00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:17.150
I don't think the chocolate really does itself justice in an ice cream

364
00:20:17.151 --> 00:20:21.260
flavor. It's like ice creams version of chocolate.

365
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:25.700
Whereas with vanilla, I think ice cream does vanilla a service.

366
00:20:25.701 --> 00:20:29.600
I think it elevates vanilla. The bean, the Madagascar vanilla bean.

367
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:33.050
<v 2>But once it elevated, it's a flavor that nobody needs elevated.</v>

368
00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:34.310
<v 3>Don't get me wrong. I'm not talking about,</v>

369
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.730
I'm not going to the places you go to get your ice cream. Okay. I go,

370
00:20:37.731 --> 00:20:38.564
what do you, what are you buying.

371
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:41.390
<v 2>Scream? You bought it for me.</v>

372
00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.550
And I wouldn't have touched the vanilla in that shop.

373
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:46.670
<v 3>Listen to me, Vanessa. I think I, and I, and you know what you,</v>

374
00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:50.590
you in here and you think you're going to dominate with chocolate just because,

375
00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:55.540
because chocolate should be the favorite right now because chocolate in,

376
00:20:55.541 --> 00:20:57.070
in other iterations is a thing.

377
00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.430
But I think you're going to be surprised at the people that,

378
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.160
that come together for, for a vanilla.

379
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.170
<v 4>Ice. Oh, go ahead. I'm sorry.</v>

380
00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.890
<v 3>No, I just, I just think you're discrediting how good a good,</v>

381
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.860
a good vanilla ice cream is better than a good chocolate ice cream.

382
00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.850
<v 4>You're you're insane. Okay. Nope.</v>

383
00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.780
<v 3>Just like a vanilla shake is better than a chocolate shake. You're not,</v>

384
00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:25.230
you are insane. If you think you're nuts, a vanilla shake of a chocolate shake.

385
00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.690
That's insane. Chocolate shake has nothing.

386
00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.210
I believe a vanilla shake dominates chocolate shake.

387
00:21:30.211 --> 00:21:32.850
Even more than vanilla ice cream dominates chocolate ice cream itself,

388
00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.620
but it's the same week. It's the same argument.

389
00:21:34.621 --> 00:21:37.020
We wouldn't have another episode for it. Okay. Okay.

390
00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.680
Now maybe we can add though. Maybe we should have an addendum to this episode.

391
00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:44.310
I not for a full episode, but I just want to piggyback even right now.

392
00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:47.730
Let's go shake as well. Right now. We'll do two poles. No, no, no, no.

393
00:21:47.731 --> 00:21:51.840
Let's save, shake. Let's save. Shake. Let's save, shake. Well, I think this,

394
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:54.900
this poll is going to be a good indicator as to what to shake poles.

395
00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.390
Don't worry about it. You're getting ahead of yourself. Okay.

396
00:21:57.391 --> 00:22:00.750
And you're getting in your head. So you're not letting me put my argument. Okay.

397
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:04.800
Well I've just finished speaking. I'll debate. Okay. Okay. You ready for this?

398
00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:09.210
Nobody in history in the history of ice cream has walked into an ice cream shop

399
00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.870
and said, can I have a vanilla cone, please? Nobody, you get vanilla ice cream.

400
00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:15.450
What are you going to do? You dump hot, fudge all over it.

401
00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:18.990
You put it in a coup in a pretzel classic with, with chocolate,

402
00:22:18.991 --> 00:22:20.610
whatever magic shell on it.

403
00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:25.560
You put it inside a conduct by Klondike bar because it cannot carry water on

404
00:22:25.561 --> 00:22:29.190
its own. No chocolate ice cream. Give me a big bowl of it.

405
00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.800
I'll eat it straight down plain. By itself reason,

406
00:22:31.801 --> 00:22:35.490
you put it with everything else is because vanilla elevates every other thing

407
00:22:35.491 --> 00:22:39.720
and is so versatile that it compliments everything you want to throw in it.

408
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.810
You don't do that with chocolate because chocolate is Elizabeth.

409
00:22:42.811 --> 00:22:47.280
This just doesn't need it. Overpower anything. Doesn't need vanilla compliments,

410
00:22:47.281 --> 00:22:50.430
vanilla compliments, every other ingredient, chocolate overpowers,

411
00:22:50.431 --> 00:22:55.260
every other ingredient, vanilla ice cream is the millennia trumps of ice cream,

412
00:22:55.261 --> 00:22:59.610
useless, but looks good next to something else. That's what it is.

413
00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:02.460
That's what it is. And I don't mean that in a sexist way,

414
00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:04.380
something that you called not good,

415
00:23:04.381 --> 00:23:07.500
made it to first lady of the United States.

416
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.890
So what she had to do to get there, all right, what is it?

417
00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:14.280
I don't even know what that means. Trump look with vanilla.

418
00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:19.080
Vanilla has to Trump itself to get onto my plate. It's got a,

419
00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:23.310
it's got to put a very good, I gotta be honest, like,

420
00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:25.080
like give me a beautiful,

421
00:23:25.081 --> 00:23:29.520
like variation of a chocolate bar from light to dark chocolate gives me, uh,

422
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:33.600
a beautiful fudge, a mousse. Even I'll take a chocolate pudding.

423
00:23:33.601 --> 00:23:36.390
I love chocolate. I love chocolate candy. I love it.

424
00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:40.320
But as an ice cream look,

425
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:44.790
every picture it's with something else. That's cause it's amazing. No,

426
00:23:44.791 --> 00:23:45.591
it's the high,

427
00:23:45.591 --> 00:23:48.650
the classic Hoggin does dip chocolate with almond is vanilla based.

428
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.930
The classic chip, which is vanilla based.

429
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:53.210
The classic flying saucer is vanilla base.

430
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:57.230
Chocolate cookie dough goes with vanilla cookies and cream.

431
00:23:57.231 --> 00:24:00.860
It goes to a vanilla, an ice cream sundae. You usually use vanilla.

432
00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:04.240
<v 2>We're talking ice cream versus ice cream.</v>

433
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:07.870
You would never eat a bowl of vanilla ice cream by itself.

434
00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:12.580
<v 3>I don't know who you are and where you came from, but what you just said,</v>

435
00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.610
I makes absolutely no sense. It's all I've done my entire life.

436
00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:17.110
And a couple of moments ago,

437
00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:19.690
you said Colin would ever walk into an ice cream shop and say,

438
00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.460
let me have a vanilla cone. Well,

439
00:24:21.461 --> 00:24:23.260
I don't know list how you were in the ice cream shop,

440
00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:27.160
but I bet you dollars to donuts. Fine with me if you were a month ago. Great.

441
00:24:27.161 --> 00:24:29.350
Okay. And I bet you, if we sit there two seconds longer,

442
00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.320
someone come in and say, I'll have a vanilla cone out of your mind. Okay?

443
00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:34.870
<v 2>Right. All right. You're out of your mind. You're out of your mind.</v>

444
00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:37.690
Let me tell you what Neapolitan looks like when I throw it away.

445
00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:40.870
All vanilla still in there, all vanilla.

446
00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:43.510
<v 3>That's ridiculous. And you're not even,</v>

447
00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:45.940
you're not even embracing what the Neapolitan's about,

448
00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.480
which is a bite of different flavor. In every bite. I look at it.

449
00:24:49.481 --> 00:24:51.430
Vanilla actually really like strawberry ice cream as well.

450
00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:52.930
I'll tell you what I like strawberry ice cream.

451
00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.470
<v 2>That's fine. That's not the debate though. And that's not decide you chose.</v>

452
00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:57.700
You chose. You had a chance.

453
00:24:57.701 --> 00:25:00.400
You could have chose that and maybe had a chance at winning this.

454
00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:04.900
Nobody is picking don't scream over chocolate ice cream.

455
00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.180
<v 3>Chocolate wins. It's not better.</v>

456
00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:09.880
But you're saying I have no chance of winning this.

457
00:25:09.881 --> 00:25:12.820
I think you're going to be surprised when it comes to ice cream,

458
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.400
how many people will pivot vanilla. Okay.

459
00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:19.720
I'm telling you there's something about just a rich, creamy, smooth,

460
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:20.583
vanilla tastes.

461
00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:24.340
Sometimes chocolate tastes like processed manufactured chocolate.

462
00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:27.040
If you're not going to a really artismal spot.

463
00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.080
<v 2>Sometimes anything case like that, what kind of argument?</v>

464
00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.610
<v 3>Soft serve you go vanilla. Chocolate, chocolate. You're bat crazy.</v>

465
00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.410
And I'll go mix. I'll go.

466
00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.690
<v 2>Mix sometimes, but I'm not going vanilla. Are.</v>

467
00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:41.080
<v 3>You nuts? Nuts. You're nuts. Come on, man. Get outta here.</v>

468
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.570
Rainbow sprinkles on a chocolate cone. What do you associate?

469
00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:48.790
<v 2>I don't use sprinkles. What do you Jimmy's? No, I don't. I know it's a waste.</v>

470
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.320
Sprinkles are a waste. Yeah.

471
00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:53.350
<v 3>Like whip wrinkles are always like whipped cream. Cream is a waste.</v>

472
00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:57.220
Now you see now where he's coming from in his whole entire argument,

473
00:25:57.221 --> 00:25:59.830
a man that thinks sprinkles and whipped cream are a waste.

474
00:25:59.831 --> 00:26:01.630
What are you baiting me about ice cream.

475
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:02.920
<v 2>What do you get out of sprinkles?</v>

476
00:26:02.921 --> 00:26:05.380
Aside from the fact that it tastes like you put plastic on it.

477
00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:08.260
<v 3>Top of your ice cream. I know where you're getting your sprinkles. Oh please.</v>

478
00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.140
I get, I get, uh, I get a burst,

479
00:26:11.141 --> 00:26:15.850
a colorful burst of energy and flavor and fun texture. Yeah.

480
00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.850
<v 2>Look fine. Okay. If you want to argue that they add text.</v>

481
00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:23.140
<v 3>Look at it. Look at a cone that is doused in, in, in rainbow sprinkles.</v>

482
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:28.930
It is fun. You said, what do I get? It's fun. It's vibrant.

483
00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:33.640
It runs down the vanilla and it dies. The vanilla, all different colors,

484
00:26:33.641 --> 00:26:34.630
which makes it even more fun.

485
00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:37.900
And then you bite into it and you get the texture versus the creaminess.

486
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.840
Can I go on about sprinkles?

487
00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.470
<v 2>I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll tell you what I do. I'll get a chocolate cone.</v>

488
00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:46.950
Chocolates are served with chocolate sprinkles out of spite.

489
00:26:46.951 --> 00:26:48.360
I'll do it out of spite.

490
00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:50.240
<v 1>Rainbow sprinkles. Aren't vanilla sprinkles.</v>

491
00:26:50.241 --> 00:26:51.920
So that spite analogy does not work.

492
00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:53.810
No I'm saying I'm going to double up on the chocolate.

493
00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.970
I'm going to get chocolate sprinkles on top of chocolate sauce.

494
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.450
I don't not like chocolate ice cream. Does that make sense?

495
00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:06.530
[inaudible] but, but, but when you put it against vanilla, I'm sorry.

496
00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:10.880
<v 2>Sorry. You like these foods. I like vanilla icing better than chocolate.</v>

497
00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:15.530
You like these foods that have to be added into things.

498
00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.790
This is what was your recording?

499
00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.910
<v 1>Vanilla. Venice was your Oreo.</v>

500
00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:24.200
Della bean is a beautiful superior item. Deserves to be a.

501
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:27.980
It's a food. You think it's a food? I'll say nobody thinks of vanilla is.

502
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:32.300
I'll say Ella is vanilla is in everything, food. Okay.

503
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:36.050
<v 2>Vanilla like cream soda. It's just the most disgusting soda on planet earth.</v>

504
00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:39.440
So it is delicious. Mark it down.

505
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.520
<v 1>Versus Watteau versus versus what.</v>

506
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:47.180
<v 2>I think cream soda is the most disgusting soda I drink to ever exist.</v>

507
00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.600
And if you think it's delicious, we got a nice debate.

508
00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.740
<v 1>Right? Cream soda is terrific. It's the, do I take something over it?</v>

509
00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:59.240
I mean all like health aside, I like root beer probably better.

510
00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.880
I also like a black cherry soda better, but I don't really drink.

511
00:28:01.881 --> 00:28:04.640
These things will work. We'll work. We'll work it out later,

512
00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.220
but I'm telling you you'll think it's delicious.

513
00:28:07.221 --> 00:28:09.650
I had like a burger at a and w with an ice cream soda,

514
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:12.320
I think hopped off the truck with a cream soda.

515
00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:17.560
<v 2>I think cream soda oil is the most disgusting drink to ever.</v>

516
00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.510
<v 1>Exist. What about dumdums lollipops cream soda.</v>

517
00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:23.780
<v 2>Speaking Japanese over here.</v>

518
00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:28.160
I think it's the most disgusting soda to ever drink.

519
00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:30.350
Beverage Andre prune juice. Before I drink cream.

520
00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:34.850
<v 1>You got a, you got, uh, you got some deep rooted issues with some of this stuff.</v>

521
00:28:34.851 --> 00:28:35.660
I don't understand what it is.

522
00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:40.610
<v 2>Not deep rooted. It's I, I have, I have taste buds and my taste buds.</v>

523
00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.900
Don't like certain things. And I'm telling you a cream soda stinks.

524
00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:48.160
<v 1>Now what I love to do with vanilla, I make myself a bowl, ice cream.</v>

525
00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.930
I did this since I'm a kid. You talk about how I like a vanilla shake.

526
00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.630
A lot of that is scoop of vanilla in the milk and all the other stuff.

527
00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:58.040
And so I get my ice cream. I just let him out. I just let it melt.

528
00:28:58.041 --> 00:29:01.550
I look at it and I desire it. And I build up the excitement.

529
00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.820
I'm going to have it, but I wait until it's melted. As a matter of fact,

530
00:29:04.821 --> 00:29:08.600
to speed up the process, I put the spoon in and I go like this.

531
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:10.970
And then it gets w w w I such a whip. It,

532
00:29:10.971 --> 00:29:13.790
it gets lighter and lighter and lighter and lighter until it becomes basically

533
00:29:13.791 --> 00:29:15.860
an ice cold vanilla soup. And then I,

534
00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:21.020
and I sip the vanilla ice cold vanilla liquid off the spoon. No, what?

535
00:29:21.021 --> 00:29:23.510
I don't do that with chocolate.

536
00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:27.440
<v 2>No human being on earth does what you just described. Your,</v>

537
00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:31.550
my sister did it well, look to tell you, we all did it.

538
00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:34.090
What you just described sounds.

539
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:36.110
<v 1>Well, you don't like when the ice cream melts,</v>

540
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:40.760
if you're eating out of a pint and the edges get really liquefied and melty

541
00:29:40.761 --> 00:29:42.310
first, when you, instead of the center.

542
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:45.280
<v 3>When you, you don't go to the side with your spoon and pull up the</v>

543
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:50.020
[inaudible] like a hobo would do on Thanksgiving. Like that would be a hobos.

544
00:29:50.021 --> 00:29:53.650
Thanksgiving meal is he would go, Oh boy, we're going to eat tonight.

545
00:29:53.651 --> 00:29:55.360
And he would melt his ice cream now.

546
00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.150
And then pretend he was eating a fancy suit. Here's something,

547
00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.040
here's something I don't agree with with you.

548
00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:07.360
You don't like to eat foods and try foods in different ways.

549
00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:09.310
I put a cop out to the food,

550
00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:13.060
which I think is one of the complex variations of the finding.

551
00:30:13.061 --> 00:30:15.790
It's one of the benefactors of what you could do with the food.

552
00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:19.120
I could eat ice cream, hard. I could eat ice cream soft. I could twist an Oreo.

553
00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:21.220
I could not. And you're like, well, if you got a twister.

554
00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:24.690
<v 2>No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You're, you're, you're,</v>

555
00:30:24.691 --> 00:30:29.100
you're confusing things here. I do like to eat foods and different variations.

556
00:30:29.101 --> 00:30:30.150
I do appreciate it.

557
00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:35.100
But when we're talking about the raw base quality of one food versus the

558
00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:36.330
other, and,

559
00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:41.220
and you have to rely on the variation of that food to win.

560
00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:45.300
<v 3>No, no, that's not a better. I was letting my, my vanilla melt,</v>

561
00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:49.960
relying on a variation to when I'm saying everything, almost everything.

562
00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:51.930
<v 2>You said so far about vanilla ice cream.</v>

563
00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.940
When I go every time I have no ice cream,

564
00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:58.710
that has to be paired with something that's you and you, but by point is,

565
00:30:58.711 --> 00:31:00.600
as you said, because it's awesome because it's great. Yeah.

566
00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:04.860
<v 3>It's because it's two weeks raises up. No, it's not.</v>

567
00:31:04.861 --> 00:31:08.100
It raises up all the other ingredients. It enhances everything vanilla.

568
00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.840
Do you know what the ingredient is? Singing in the vanilla.

569
00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:14.370
You raise me up so I can stand on

570
00:31:14.371 --> 00:31:15.600
mountains.

571
00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:19.860
<v 2>So, so here's my thing. If, if I said to you, uh,</v>

572
00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:25.350
a steak is the best meat, all right. And you went. Yeah. And I, and I said,

573
00:31:25.351 --> 00:31:30.300
you know, I love steak, uh, with cheese, I love steak with barbecue sauce.

574
00:31:30.301 --> 00:31:31.134
I love to say.

575
00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:33.750
<v 3>It's kind of like, well, steak, maybe isn't the best meat.</v>

576
00:31:33.751 --> 00:31:37.290
Because every time you say you like it, you got to put something on it. Okay?

577
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:41.040
You are so full of crap. Why?

578
00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:44.400
Because the only two of the only times we had this argument is right now with

579
00:31:44.401 --> 00:31:47.550
the vanilla. You're the one who said, every time I have to have it,

580
00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:52.320
I put something on it. I've never had to say that. I said, I eat it plain.

581
00:31:52.321 --> 00:31:53.700
I see many people who played, but I said,

582
00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:58.200
the reason people do that is because vanilla goes with everything and it

583
00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:02.520
uplifts everything. Then you are making that. My argument, why vanilla is good.

584
00:32:02.521 --> 00:32:05.490
That's not what I said. You said it. And when I said, Oreo,

585
00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:09.990
adding cheese to a steak or this to a steak is not the same thing as choosing to

586
00:32:09.991 --> 00:32:13.800
eat my Oreo cream first twist or not twist you as you're applying,

587
00:32:13.801 --> 00:32:16.260
it's just the Oreo. I'm just eating the main ingredients.

588
00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.960
I'm just deciding how I want to eat it.

589
00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:23.010
And you're saying that somehow makes it a negative thing.

590
00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.210
I think it's a positive,

591
00:32:24.211 --> 00:32:26.100
but I could eat an order of your arguments was the Oreo.

592
00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:30.090
<v 2>Was that you put them in milk and drank them. Okay.</v>

593
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:35.490
<v 3>Another, another hobo meal that you do don't understand. You're right,</v>

594
00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:40.370
Joe. You're right. I am. I am out in the hobo city, Duncan cookies and milk.

595
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:44.690
Nobody, but hobos dunks their cookies and milk. That's me.

596
00:32:44.691 --> 00:32:48.050
And I should just have I put all my cookies in the Bendel and I just.

597
00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:52.840
<v 2>It's clear. It's clear. We are going to come nowhere near, even by the way,</v>

598
00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:58.000
dunking. Listen, we'll get to it, Don. We'll get to it. Yeah. W w we will,

599
00:32:58.001 --> 00:32:59.890
we will, we will get to it obviously.

600
00:32:59.891 --> 00:33:03.070
And we are not going to come anywhere near agreeing. We are at Wella time.

601
00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:05.760
So let's go to the polls. Let's see. Let's see what they.

602
00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:10.150
<v 3>Be honest. You know, you're a pig, just like Apple pie. Chocolate is King,</v>

603
00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:14.110
but I don't know right now you're going to be surprised backpedal now going to

604
00:33:14.111 --> 00:33:16.570
be surprised. Okay, here we go.

605
00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:23.860
Here we go. Woo. Okay.

606
00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:25.240
Right now we have.

607
00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:27.970
<v 2>Hold on. Who's some eating humble pie though.</v>

608
00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:30.130
<v 3>Right? Our segment has come the humble.</v>

609
00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:33.760
This is the humble pie segment where somebody's got to eat some humble pie.

610
00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:36.520
And it's because he got to the white. It's funny. Uh,

611
00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:44.340
so when I say humble pie, uh, what do you, what do you think the percentage.

612
00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:45.513
<v 2>Going to be? Don't pull it up yet.</v>

613
00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:48.460
I think it's going to be a slaughtering with chocolate in the wind.

614
00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:53.440
I think chocolate is in the 80 percentile, somewhere in the eighties.

615
00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.390
That's what I think. Okay.

616
00:33:55.630 --> 00:34:00.280
<v 3>So as of right now, we have, uh, 2,500 votes and,</v>

617
00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:05.560
uh, we have a winner.

618
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.700
Okay.

619
00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:10.420
<v 2>It's closer than that. Okay. I told you that it would be okay.</v>

620
00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:15.250
<v 3>Right now we have 56 to 44%, which is,</v>

621
00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:17.020
which is relatively close.

622
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:20.710
I think we said that as if something closed out on a pole within 2%,

623
00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:24.790
it could have a rematch. So we're near rematch territory,

624
00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:29.500
but it's God vanilla, baby. You son. I told you,

625
00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:32.830
I called you. I told you 2000,

626
00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:37.000
you got vanilla in the lead. You didn't want to listen.

627
00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:38.590
This is the biggest upset we've had.

628
00:34:38.591 --> 00:34:42.970
So far chocolate had every right to win because people I told you,

629
00:34:42.971 --> 00:34:45.310
when it comes to vanilla people, when it comes to ice cream,

630
00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:47.530
people change their palettes. I take change it.

631
00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:51.340
People like in generally like vanilla ice cream, more than chocolate ice cream.

632
00:34:51.850 --> 00:34:53.350
They'll look at your big powerhouse.

633
00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:57.010
Your 80% powerhouse is in the 43.

634
00:34:57.011 --> 00:35:01.550
Now 43.9 to 56 point once reached out to the rest of my

635
00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:05.290
baby, eat the pie.

636
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:09.220
I ate the humble pie. No, this is a huge assumption. Don't just go.

637
00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:11.620
This is don't just go to them yet. Don't just go to them.

638
00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:16.270
You got to give this it's respect because this was, this is an upset. This is,

639
00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:19.900
this is one of the biggest substance we ever had, but not to me because I knew,

640
00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:20.763
I knew.

641
00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:25.000
I knew that people love vanilla ice cream,

642
00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:28.570
vanilla ice cream is more popular than chocolate ice cream.

643
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:33.400
Even in stores, vanilla based items are more popular than vanilla.

644
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:36.760
I'm telling you vanilla is King. When it comes to ice cream, it was a,

645
00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.570
this something misconstrued.

646
00:35:39.571 --> 00:35:42.960
It says best classic ice cream flavor and big surprise.

647
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:47.340
The tenderloins fan club agreed with Sao. I think they know what you like.

648
00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:48.203
They are. Oh yeah.

649
00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:52.800
I've been watching your TV for 12 years and at least once a season, I go,

650
00:35:52.801 --> 00:35:56.070
I talk about vanilla ice cream. I'm sure it's come up before. Oh my God. I mean,

651
00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:58.890
Joe, it's 2,500 votes, not one person.

652
00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:00.900
You're looking at the 10 Lawrence van club cook. I mean,

653
00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:03.660
it's 20 by just take the kicking.

654
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:07.170
<v 2>Let's read them. Let's read them. Go ahead.</v>

655
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:10.650
<v 3>That's just an upset. I'm upset. I'm angry. This is ridiculous. I'm angry.</v>

656
00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:14.520
Vanilla is just boring. Says somebody's always got to pick the winner.

657
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:17.220
Always default. We're going to pick the best comment and the win.

658
00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:20.040
We're going to pick the best comment. We actually, people, we got a week.

659
00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.740
If people need to know about that because we're doing it. But then.

660
00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.610
<v 2>All right, always.</v>

661
00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:29.210
<v 3>Vanilla or soft serve, twist vanilla hands down for me.</v>

662
00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:34.040
Vanilla has so much range of V and beautiful

663
00:36:34.041 --> 00:36:38.450
subtleties thinking. Vanilla is plain is a new sense of taste.

664
00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:41.750
Vanilla makes all of your baked goods better. It is the salt of sweets.

665
00:36:41.751 --> 00:36:45.560
Vanilla even makes you chocolate better. Anyway, vanilla ice cream, all the way.

666
00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:49.940
Vanilla pene, goats. Oh, she just said, I'm going to say,

667
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:53.810
I said, don't scroll. You said it. Let me tell you. I have,

668
00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:57.710
I have a connection to the people to listen to this pocket.

669
00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:01.400
That was basically my entire argument. She just summed up in her tweet.

670
00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:04.640
I got a shout out. I'm going to wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No,

671
00:37:04.641 --> 00:37:07.760
we only shout out the winter, the winter. I will say this,

672
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:11.600
but honestly that is a great, I will say this. She has my back.

673
00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:15.710
<v 2>For winter already. Unless somebody tops that that's the winter. Yeah.</v>

674
00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:19.670
That's the winter response, but, but don't shout her out just yet. All right.

675
00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:20.563
Let's keep going.

676
00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:22.520
<v 3>Has more add on opportunities.</v>

677
00:37:22.521 --> 00:37:26.450
You can only add so much to chocolate and still be good. Vanilla is endless.

678
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:28.100
Sing it, sisters and brothers,

679
00:37:28.101 --> 00:37:30.860
because this is what I was telling you didn't want to listen to me.

680
00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.180
Maybe you'll listen to the people.

681
00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:36.350
<v 2>I've never listened to the people, which is why I'm where I'm at in my career.</v>

682
00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:42.470
<v 3>Sure. How about this one? This is, this is insightful. This is insightful. Yeah.</v>

683
00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:47.450
Chocolate is my favorite. But vanilla goes with everything. So vanilla wins.

684
00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:52.490
You can't, that means chocolate wins. If you say chocolate is your favorite,

685
00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:56.510
then that means chocolate wins. That's a ridiculous. This is the only right.

686
00:37:56.511 --> 00:37:59.750
Answer is vanilla, vanilla bean specifically. And by the way,

687
00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:04.250
look over and over Mike, you can see it over and over again, the same argument,

688
00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:08.510
but you can put vanilla with so many things. So what, so what?

689
00:38:08.511 --> 00:38:11.570
You can put salt with so many things. I don't want to eat a bowl of salt.

690
00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:15.290
How is vanilla beating chocolate with a Britney Spears? Conf confusing.

691
00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:17.720
<v 2>Gift for Jeff.</v>

692
00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:22.910
Nobody knows ever chocolate is my favorite, but vanilla goes, Oh,

693
00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:26.600
you already read that one. Rocky roadmap people.

694
00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:30.530
Once you see these episodes, you'll know we're making this request.

695
00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:35.090
Don't tell us a third thing. It's not cute. We don't, we don't. Yeah.

696
00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:36.100
Vanilla.

697
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.800
<v 1>Chocolate Rocky road. Nobody wants the other,</v>

698
00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:43.390
this guy is doing his own jokers in the middle of our food pole,

699
00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:47.110
obviously vanilla. And if you say chocolate,

700
00:38:47.111 --> 00:38:51.160
you had dropped off Joker's poll at 57% on his own Twitter feed,

701
00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:56.290
which surprise DIA, uh, obviously vanilla. And if you say chocolate,

702
00:38:56.291 --> 00:38:59.050
you were dropped on your head. All right. Y'all are fake.

703
00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:01.930
Chocolate is the only right answer. Only,

704
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:05.800
also vanilla has for most of its short commercial history, involved child labor.

705
00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:09.560
<v 2>Where's the pistachio button. All right. Our winner.</v>

706
00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:15.060
<v 1>Vanilla is just boring. Let's shout out our winter ice cream is effing trash,</v>

707
00:39:15.061 --> 00:39:17.190
and I will fight people to death on this.

708
00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:20.250
<v 2>Shout out our winner, that, that woman,</v>

709
00:39:20.251 --> 00:39:24.420
that one spa shout out to the spa.

710
00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:28.320
Gooner she's you can follow her at, at babe gorgeous. Babe. Look,

711
00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:32.220
she's even got babe in the title at babe gorgeous, babe. Uh,

712
00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:35.100
and she won with, with the, I mean.

713
00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:36.690
<v 1>God, that's a, I mean, it's just,</v>

714
00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:40.560
we didn't have anyone that really it's usually the winner is someone that

715
00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:43.740
[inaudible] has the biggest laugh so far,

716
00:39:43.741 --> 00:39:46.050
but this one is just such a well-rounded out.

717
00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:49.140
It's an efficient argument contained in one tweet.

718
00:39:49.141 --> 00:39:52.530
I think it really she's right. She's right about everything she said,

719
00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:57.450
I might get this tattooed on me. This is, and let's just, just,

720
00:39:57.451 --> 00:40:00.300
just for good measure. Let's just make sure what that vanilla is still winning.

721
00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:07.020
Yeah, it is. I mean, it's 55 45 now, but it's 3000 votes.

722
00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:11.220
This one hurts. I'm not going to lie when he gets upset by a false one,

723
00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:13.950
predicting 80 20. This was.

724
00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.190
<v 2>Here's the thing I'm I'm aggravated.</v>

725
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:19.470
<v 1>Right now. Yeah. This was the first debate.</v>

726
00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:22.380
<v 2>To where, and I don't know if you could feel it, Mike,</v>

727
00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:26.760
there was some real venom. There was some real venom in this one. Uh,

728
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:29.670
there was some real, it was, it was getting heated. So I'm, I'm,

729
00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.460
I'm upset about this one. So let's end the episode

730
00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:38.640
And move on to the next episode, which I'm going to win.

731
00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:41.850
<v 5>Uh, plugs, plugs.</v>

732
00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:46.320
<v 1>Uh, and then the sign off. Yeah. Is that answer before plugs? Oh,</v>

733
00:40:46.321 --> 00:40:50.520
that's right before. Well, if it is, look, I know this was,

734
00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:54.060
I know there was some animosity here today, but I still love you.

735
00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:55.470
I love you too.

736
00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:57.900
<v 2>All right. All right. Taste buddies. Uh,</v>

737
00:40:57.930 --> 00:41:00.810
if you want to hear even more of me debating things, uh,

738
00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:03.660
I have a news podcast to do a Korean Fisher. It's called without a country.
