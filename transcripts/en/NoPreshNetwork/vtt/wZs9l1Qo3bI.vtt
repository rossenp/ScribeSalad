1
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.450
<v 0>Taste bugs. They come into the mic, talking about the food.</v>

2
00:00:03.451 --> 00:00:06.630
They hate talking about the food they like to, fool's gonna fake it.

3
00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:10.290
Only one food, 10 rate taste buds, man. Didn't come into them.

4
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:13.080
I come shock and say, Hey.

5
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.630
<v 1>Welcome to taste buds. The podcast about food. We fight it out. We Duke it out.</v>

6
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.400
We argue food. My name's Joe. Hey, I'm Sal. We got a good one for you today. Oh,

7
00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:24.320
we got to go on for you to taste buddies. We have,

8
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.310
we have sort of traipsed into breakfast territory in the past.

9
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.070
Uh, not, not, I guess, less frequently than some of the other meals, but, uh,

10
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.690
we today are daring to set foot in the arena of cereal.

11
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.030
<v 2>Breakfast, cereal. Uh.</v>

12
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.030
<v 1>And we got two good ones that are going to face off here.</v>

13
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.040
A classic.

14
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.160
<v 2>Do you want to get something out of the way that we both think this is? Uh,</v>

15
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.800
sometimes we have, you know, we also, we also bond over.

16
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.360
<v 1>Good point. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:53.361 --> 00:00:57.770
We think the best breakfast cereal ever is captain crunch with crunch berries at

18
00:00:57.771 --> 00:01:00.620
the moment. Uh, you know, yeah.

19
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.980
<v 2>But they're always a competitor for me. And there's one that I love.</v>

20
00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:07.610
One of my favorite shows that I love that has recently changed their formula

21
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.260
formula or, or flavor that has taken a hit for me, but in its best form,

22
00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:16.730
I put it up there and it's never anyone's favorite, right. Posts alphabets.

23
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.180
But I could never put that up against a popular cereal.

24
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.190
<v 1>I, you know, man, I had alphabets once as a kid or twice, maybe I remember it,</v>

25
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.840
it just tasting like, it was like it was missing. It was like lucky charms,

26
00:01:29.841 --> 00:01:30.410
except there was no.

27
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.620
<v 2>Marshmallows. That's right. It's a little different, but it's right.</v>

28
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.390
And sometimes I think the marshmallows are a bit too much,

29
00:01:35.391 --> 00:01:38.240
but they did venture in, uh, alphabets was a blue box.

30
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.450
Alpha-beta marshmallows was a purple box and it was just as popular if not more

31
00:01:41.451 --> 00:01:45.080
popular. I don't know if they still make the, the alphabets with marshmallows.

32
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.400
Okay. But, uh,

33
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.120
but that's not who I'm going to put up against because I know for a fact I'm

34
00:01:50.121 --> 00:01:53.480
going to lose that one by a landslide. And it just, I kind of want,

35
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.060
I could argue it, believe me, but, but,

36
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.040
but I'd rather do something that I think is a little bit of a closer.

37
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.510
<v 1>I'm also a huge fan, big surprise of chips, hoist cereal,</v>

38
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.360
which I did bring into the fall.

39
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.400
<v 2>This company has gotten you by, by the, the, the ball, the balls.</v>

40
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.740
That's what you want to call them.

41
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.820
<v 1>Be arguing on behalf of an American classic.</v>

42
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.190
<v 2>And I don't like chocolate cereal, by the way. I don't understand.</v>

43
00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:24.620
I want to say, I don't want to wake up and eat sweets. Like, I mean, well,

44
00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:29.540
I guess I should, I don't want to eat up any chocolate. It's weird to me.

45
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.300
I don't, I don't want chocolate. The moment I wake up, I don't want chocolate.

46
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.930
I don't want chocolate cocoa pebbles. I do not.

47
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.320
<v 1>You don't like chips. Uh Armena uh, cookie crisp.</v>

48
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.350
<v 2>Well, when I said I didn't like chocolate cereal,</v>

49
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.190
I didn't mean besides these 10.

50
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.560
<v 1>I know I'm just getting you ready.</v>

51
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.030
<v 2>Buddy. I don't like, um,</v>

52
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.800
I hate pancake or waffle maple syrup cereal,

53
00:02:54.801 --> 00:02:57.290
or I don't like when they just load all like this,

54
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.100
it's like supposed to taste like else. Do.

55
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.600
<v 1>You like chocolate chip pancakes?</v>

56
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.410
<v 2>Oh, you sure don't mind. Really? Yeah.</v>

57
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.720
But there's something about those that I don't know.

58
00:03:06.721 --> 00:03:09.720
I don't feel it as chocolate per se. Blueberry. I'll take first.

59
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.610
But my point is in serial form,

60
00:03:11.611 --> 00:03:14.820
I don't want it to be chomping on some processed chocolate.

61
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.410
<v 1>I hate chocolate chip banks. I hate chocolate chip pancakes. There's too much.</v>

62
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.570
It's too much. Oh my God. What?

63
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.980
<v 2>Well you just see, just see one. This is where you curb it. No, no, no, no.</v>

64
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.980
But those first few bites forget about it. They believe.

65
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.890
<v 1>I like it. I like it because you can't.</v>

66
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.850
<v 2>Your bees, aren't blown off first three bites of a, of a chocolate chip cookie.</v>

67
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.920
<v 1>Nope. And I'll tell you why. And it's the same reason.</v>

68
00:03:40.921 --> 00:03:42.810
I'm not crazy about blueberry pancakes either.

69
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.260
Now I'll take a blueberry pancake over chocolate. And once in a while,

70
00:03:46.261 --> 00:03:49.080
I'll think I want a blueberry pancake and then I'll regret it.

71
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.350
I never want a chocolate pancake. Uh, now.

72
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.080
<v 2>Here's why listen to another episode, just pouring.</v>

73
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.570
<v 1>That syrup onto it. It's tough.</v>

74
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.990
<v 2>Who much, man? It's dif it's two different kinds of sweets.</v>

75
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.300
I don't know why I agree. I don't even put syrup onto it.

76
00:04:03.301 --> 00:04:06.480
I pour my syrup on the side and I control my, uh,

77
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.090
my syrup proportions, but I dip into the syrup. Sometimes I don't even do that.

78
00:04:12.091 --> 00:04:13.800
You know what I do because that's too much, you know what I do?

79
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.760
Sometimes I place my fork into the syrup. I lifted out.

80
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.290
I let it drip off so that there's just a light coating on the four prongs.

81
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.420
And then I spear the pancake and I eat it with as minimal maple syrup as

82
00:04:27.421 --> 00:04:31.740
possible. I get to touch a flavor, but I hate dousing it in and a lot of syrup.

83
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.890
Okay. So if I've enlightened you in any way, please take that.

84
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.730
<v 1>I still don't want to eat chocolate chip pancakes. Um.</v>

85
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.040
<v 2>It's our, I think a waffle is better than a pancake anyway.</v>

86
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.050
<v 1>I mean, what do you do with this? I mean, it's ridiculous.</v>

87
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.350
The international house of waffles. Yeah. That's a, that's a popular choice.

88
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.360
<v 2>That's what you should stand behind. Stand behind. I hop,</v>

89
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.410
they're known for quality. There's nothing. One sidewalk.

90
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.070
I Perkins, you know, Derrick accessible.

91
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.370
They're very accessible. Like,

92
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.010
like it's like there is assessable establishments that I don't think are known

93
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.810
for high quality, fresh ingredients. You know, if I, if I'm going to,

94
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.153
I can name,

95
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.360
I can name a hundred other places that will give me a better pancake than I hop

96
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.283
a hundred.

97
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:20.910
<v 1>Change, the.</v>

98
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.100
<v 2>Major change. But my point is it's chained food.</v>

99
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.280
<v 1>Chain food, correct? Yeah. You know,</v>

100
00:05:26.281 --> 00:05:30.780
any other chains is putting five shirts out on the table. Perkins, Perkins,

101
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.420
get the outta here.

102
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.490
<v 2>I mean, I don't get any credit for answering correctly.</v>

103
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.720
Perkins does not put Perkins is the, I hop of Perkins.

104
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.250
Perkins is the iHub of IOP like Perkins. I'm not going to say they don't.

105
00:05:47.251 --> 00:05:52.080
What am I trying to say? Perkins is the iHub of non IHOPs IHOPs.

106
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.330
Listen, I've, I'll eat simple.

107
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.590
<v 1>I'll eat at Perkins,</v>

108
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.150
but you're you put an apples and oranges together here at Perkins is not.

109
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.853
Perkins is fine.

110
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.850
<v 2>It's identical menus. Dennis.</v>

111
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.180
Dennis is putting out SERPs scissors, like nobody's busy or not. Nobody's busy.

112
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.410
<v 1>They do not have that syrup bar on the table. Like I hopped up.</v>

113
00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.490
<v 2>I don't know, get me wrong. See what I say? I don't know about it. But, um,</v>

114
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.360
but I do feel that Denny's Perkins and I hop are cut from the same cloth.

115
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.220
And so, and I do know that they,

116
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.590
I think they might have multiple don't get me wrong. No,

117
00:06:26.591 --> 00:06:28.600
one's going to put the stamp on a pancake,

118
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:33.310
like the chain of international house of pancakes, less sweet, less.

119
00:06:33.311 --> 00:06:36.490
We call out when they change their names to international house of that was a

120
00:06:36.491 --> 00:06:37.570
joke burgers.

121
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.100
<v 1>It was a publicity joke. Oh, it did. Well, it did. You're talking about it.</v>

122
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.890
That's the point I thought they changed. That's what everybody thought.

123
00:06:44.891 --> 00:06:45.940
And they didn't. So they are.

124
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.370
<v 2>I mean, this is brand confusion. No.</v>

125
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.420
<v 1>They sit there. They did it.</v>

126
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.640
It was a thing to just let you know that we have burgers now.

127
00:06:51.641 --> 00:06:52.930
And it was a big publicity stock.

128
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.690
<v 2>I thought they only had burgers now and not pancakes.</v>

129
00:06:55.691 --> 00:06:58.750
And I've never gone in one again. Cause I could get a burger. So you haven't.

130
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.940
<v 1>Notice the signs are changed back to I hop. They.</v>

131
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.050
<v 2>Changed all the signs. Yes. That was the last bit. I guarantee you,</v>

132
00:07:05.051 --> 00:07:08.710
someone got fired for that. I guarantee it works like a charm.

133
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:09.790
It was a [inaudible].

134
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.280
<v 1>It wasn't a full pot charm.</v>

135
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:17.170
<v 2>That was, that was taken, you know, decades of loyal, uh, of,</v>

136
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:21.430
uh, of Goodwill and, and being like, we, we, we, we turn our,

137
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.100
let me get back to why blind-eye yeah.

138
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.850
<v 1>The pancakes flavored pancake is a bad thing. This isn't even the episode.</v>

139
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.450
It's not, but we're going to talk about it now. Let me get back to why,

140
00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.630
why don't we say it? Why don't we save that? Because you know what,

141
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.560
that's what I thought.

142
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.980
And then you had to put your little jab in that you think the wildfire is better

143
00:07:38.981 --> 00:07:41.950
than the pancake and you knew what you were doing when you did that.

144
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:43.000
I'll change.

145
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.850
<v 2>To waffle pancake right now. Don't tell me what a good time.</v>

146
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.100
Change it to waffle pancakes.

147
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.060
<v 4>Are you serious as you opened up a can of worms?</v>

148
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:54.880
Because I also believe.

149
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:59.890
<v 2>That a good episode could be pancake versus nah, you're right. Here's the thing.</v>

150
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:04.480
You opened up a pancake and waffle the proper adversary to face off here

151
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:05.250
or,

152
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:09.910
or do we pull back a little and pancake known as the King of breakfast food?

153
00:08:09.911 --> 00:08:14.440
Really? Unless you're in Bavaria, does pancake go up against like a bacon, egg,

154
00:08:14.441 --> 00:08:18.670
and cheese? We're doing a two-parter because it's like the breakfast type thing.

155
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:19.600
It very different.

156
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.920
Whereas pancake is more popular than a waffle and they also are kind of similar.

157
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:28.210
<v 1>I think waffles have a good shot and I'll take in pancakes all day long now.</v>

158
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:29.080
<v 2>So we should do,</v>

159
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.140
we should ask them if they want to see pancake Russ waffle or pancake versus

160
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.500
Beck, bacon, egg, and cheese, we should ask them that at least you.

161
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.660
<v 1>Can't put a pancake versus a bacon, egg, and.</v>

162
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.240
<v 2>Cheese, but then you're arguing. What's a better breakfast food.</v>

163
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:41.680
That's breakfast food.

164
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.180
<v 1>But you, because it's like are, are arguing Apple juice versus orange juice.</v>

165
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.800
What we did pancakes and waffles are the adversaries. George Carlin had a joke.

166
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.950
I have a message here from the international house of pancakes.

167
00:08:53.951 --> 00:08:57.660
And it says waffles. That was like, like that. There they are.

168
00:08:57.661 --> 00:08:58.680
The face off foods.

169
00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:02.280
<v 2>Pancakes or waffles. I'm sure they do nothing if you need to.</v>

170
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:07.190
<v 1>But since I don't know, please give me the actual facts. And I'd like to say,</v>

171
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:11.150
we should not only do pancakes versus waffles right now because you stirred it

172
00:09:11.151 --> 00:09:11.300
up.

173
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.300
You started something and you know what you did and don't roll your eyes because

174
00:09:14.301 --> 00:09:17.780
you knew what you were doing. Cause we go to bat for my cereal. So was I.

175
00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.350
<v 2>You brought up pancakes.</v>

176
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:26.150
<v 1>Being not as you just change it, change it, change it, right? I mean,</v>

177
00:09:26.151 --> 00:09:29.960
he brought it up. Folks. You almost saw golden Grahams versus fruit loop.

178
00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:34.010
We'll do it another time it's coming back. It's coming back,

179
00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.510
but you let us down a road.

180
00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.180
And we talked last night on the phone about what are we doing tomorrow?

181
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.170
And we brought up waffles versus pancakes and you go I'm waffles all the way.

182
00:09:42.171 --> 00:09:44.480
And I go, dude, I'm pancakes all the way. So.

183
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.700
<v 2>I, you know, here we are is a big one.</v>

184
00:09:46.701 --> 00:09:50.390
Then if you want to change it on the fly and I guess check your local listings

185
00:09:50.391 --> 00:09:51.830
for fruit loops for scolding grants.

186
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.040
<v 1>But it's not going anywhere better.</v>

187
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:58.730
<v 2>Breakfast is how I'm titling it. What gets put first better.</v>

188
00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.300
<v 1>Food, pancakes, waffles or pancakes. Second.</v>

189
00:10:02.301 --> 00:10:05.630
Cause you think pancakes was going to win. I think waffles could win.

190
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.820
I don't agree with it, but I do think it could win.

191
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:11.690
The fans are seeing a little behind the scenes right now.

192
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:12.830
And I liked that for them.

193
00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.630
<v 2>Pancakes is more popular in G in general. I like to put,</v>

194
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:20.160
Oh, I won't even give anything away. We got

195
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.100
to people here in the logic and then thinking that you're going to YouTube.

196
00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.800
<v 1>People, very adversarial right out of the gate.</v>

197
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.020
You taste buds launch that poll, watch that poll and let's just get into it,

198
00:10:33.021 --> 00:10:36.470
dude. All right. Let's just get into it because this is already getting hot. I,

199
00:10:36.471 --> 00:10:39.770
you know, we had two real hot episodes there already and I was like, we don't,

200
00:10:39.771 --> 00:10:42.020
I don't know if we've got a lot left in the tank. I'm like,

201
00:10:42.021 --> 00:10:45.230
we've got a lot left in the tank. Oh, I got to, I got left in and by the way,

202
00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:46.550
pancakes or waffles, which one do you see?

203
00:10:46.551 --> 00:10:51.200
This is part one of a two-part on breakfast battles. Okay. Mikey,

204
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:55.430
make a note of that. The breakfast battles. Okay. This is part one.

205
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.420
Part two is the next episode. It's bacon versus sausage. And then I got to get,

206
00:10:59.421 --> 00:11:02.850
we got to do cereal. We could do a whole breakfast month this month.

207
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.870
<v 5>Okay. All right. So, so, so.</v>

208
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:09.050
<v 2>You just want to know, and then you always roll your eyes at me,</v>

209
00:11:09.051 --> 00:11:11.660
but what am I ever listing first put.

210
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.880
<v 1>Waffles first. Since you think the pancakes is going to.</v>

211
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.630
<v 2>Win. I also want your opinion. I don't want to just hold those.</v>

212
00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:17.840
<v 1>If I told you my opinion,</v>

213
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.020
three times now I've said put pancake executive because you think it's going to

214
00:11:21.021 --> 00:11:22.850
win. I think waffles.

215
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.120
<v 2>Just agree what I'm saying for the sake of it.</v>

216
00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.310
I'm not want to make sure you get a fair shake at what you're paying.

217
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.630
And I get a little bit, can you give me.

218
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.630
<v 1>A little more credit than that please? You know, when people say.</v>

219
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.500
<v 2>Together, no one ever goes waffles and pancakes.</v>

220
00:11:36.501 --> 00:11:40.790
People always say pancakes and waffles. So put pancake second. And the re yeah,

221
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:46.040
but uh, yeah, I can I'll put it. This is going to get regional too.

222
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:49.370
Yeah. Cause you got, I hop everywhere.

223
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:54.400
I need my Belgian people to a Belgian Belgian origin launched

224
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.270
better breakfast, food, waffles, pancakes. Boom.

225
00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:02.730
<v 1>All right. We're in South. So let me say why now that the clock is running. Now,</v>

226
00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.010
let me say why. I think this is so regional.

227
00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:09.360
It's not just about America and Belgium and these other places

228
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.670
it's within America.

229
00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:16.110
There is an internal struggle between these two foods because you do have I hop,

230
00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:21.030
which is a nationwide restaurant, but you also have waffle house now,

231
00:12:21.031 --> 00:12:21.864
waffle house.

232
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:26.310
<v 2>Oh man, I liked that you brought waffle house into this.</v>

233
00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:32.400
<v 1>Nationally is nationally as accessible because it's not as spread around,</v>

234
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.410
but people that like waffle house will live and die on the sword of waffle

235
00:12:37.411 --> 00:12:38.130
house.

236
00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:42.420
<v 2>So you're going to get a lot of support. This is nothing against waffle house,</v>

237
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.090
but I didn't grow up around waffle houses.

238
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.240
And I've only been to them a few times. And uh,

239
00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:53.730
I don't want to attach my waffle to the waffle house chain.

240
00:12:53.731 --> 00:12:55.920
You could attach your pancake to whatever chain you want.

241
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:56.880
It's not attaching it to.

242
00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.400
<v 1>Anything. I'm just saying, it shows you the love for the food.</v>

243
00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:01.410
<v 2>I don't know enough about waffle house.</v>

244
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.780
<v 1>They make a hell of a waffle it's called waffle.</v>

245
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.880
<v 2>House. I've never had a waffle at a waffle house. Good.</v>

246
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.050
But my point is arguing love out there, waffle and every way that you want it.

247
00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.310
I love the, you know what I, as a kid, when my mom made, um,

248
00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.760
and Jamaima blueberry waffles was my favorite breakfast.

249
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:21.630
I liked them over Eggos. I liked my waffles square, not round, but then again.

250
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.673
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

251
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:27.300
<v 2>I'll take it. It goes, I'll take it. It goes as well.</v>

252
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.870
But my point is is that I love a delicious waffle in the house,

253
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:35.790
but then I love a delicious waffle at a diner and how it's bigger.

254
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.630
And the, the, uh, what do you call them? What should we go? The nooks,

255
00:13:39.631 --> 00:13:43.080
the crevices, the compartments, the divots. What do you want to call them?

256
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:46.590
I call them the holes personally. Oh, they're not holes. Are they now? Well,

257
00:13:46.591 --> 00:13:48.570
that's what I call them. I mean, it's not like a swished.

258
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:52.080
It means like you asked me what I call them. I can tell you when to call them.

259
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.500
Okay, well, this is what, okay. So first of all, this is,

260
00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.690
this is what general consensus is.

261
00:13:57.691 --> 00:14:00.810
How many people prefer waffles or pancakes in general?

262
00:14:00.811 --> 00:14:05.040
47% of people prefer pancakes to waffles. Does that mean 53 is waffles,

263
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:10.200
but among those for whom belly aches are a bigger problem than headaches.

264
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.430
59% of people. I don't understand what's going on here.

265
00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.850
They're saying what kind of a poll was that? Pancakes or whales?

266
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:21.660
<v 1>Waffles. They've been around for some time. At least since the 19, sorry.</v>

267
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:22.530
The 14th.

268
00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:22.951
<v 2>Thirties.</v>

269
00:14:22.951 --> 00:14:27.750
I'm competing with a dish that has been around 690

270
00:14:27.751 --> 00:14:31.860
years. The first wildfire who's 590 years.

271
00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:33.240
First waffle iron was patented.

272
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.800
<v 1>In 1869.</v>

273
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:39.780
<v 2>Oh my God. So 400, 439 years later,</v>

274
00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.380
incomes the waffle pancakes adversary.

275
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.050
That should say a lot about the waffle and what it's done.

276
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.600
The nation stages to now.

277
00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:53.660
<v 1>The only waffle eat, the only elite is a frozen waffle.</v>

278
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:55.603
That's it?

279
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:59.780
You don't want a freshly made waffle out of a waffle line.

280
00:14:59.781 --> 00:15:01.490
I get local holiday Inn. No.

281
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.960
<v 2>Like at a continental breakfast, you don't, you don't want to go to,</v>

282
00:15:04.961 --> 00:15:06.100
you don't want to go to a diner.

283
00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.770
I can't go New York diner and order a Belgian waffle.

284
00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:12.100
<v 1>Belgian waffle. Don't get me. Hold on.</v>

285
00:15:12.101 --> 00:15:16.240
I'm getting you don't want to get to Belgium. Hold on.

286
00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.830
<v 2>In between some nice ice cream shrimp, some fresh whipped cream.</v>

287
00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.350
<v 1>Or ice cream. No, not at all. You haven't heard of that.</v>

288
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:25.520
<v 2>Waffle, but I treat them.</v>

289
00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.170
<v 1>Disgust in my face. I've heard of it. I don't like it. Uh.</v>

290
00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:32.200
<v 2>The only waffle you'll eat is a frozen store-bought waffle.</v>

291
00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:36.130
And you're going to argue that the pancake is better than the waffle in its

292
00:15:36.131 --> 00:15:37.600
fullest form. I've eaten.

293
00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:41.620
<v 1>In the other kinds. And I don't like it. I don't like the flavor of it.</v>

294
00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.930
I like the flavor of a frozen waffle.

295
00:15:43.931 --> 00:15:47.470
I find that other waffles as you call them homemade, uh,

296
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.150
don't have the same flavor.

297
00:15:49.151 --> 00:15:52.870
They usually have a much sweeter or nuttier flavor that I don't care for.

298
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:55.300
I liked the flavor of a frozen waffle.

299
00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:59.800
I could crush a box of Eggos easily, easily in one sitting.

300
00:15:59.801 --> 00:16:03.310
I could do it. If, if, if, if I, if I was, if I was in the mood.

301
00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:06.340
<v 2>But you're in a, you're in good company, but.</v>

302
00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.590
<v 1>I can't tell you.</v>

303
00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:13.930
I've never once stopped at that waffle iron at the ho at the holiday and not

304
00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:15.790
once on a continental breakfast.

305
00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:19.030
<v 2>That's wild because even the process, again, I'll kind of harken back.</v>

306
00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.450
I love the overall experience of the food. That's how I judge it. Right?

307
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.980
I love the waffle iron.

308
00:16:23.981 --> 00:16:27.670
I love getting the batter and watching it fill up in the different holes until

309
00:16:27.671 --> 00:16:30.790
it fills it up. And then you push the RN down it sizzles,

310
00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.360
and then there's a flip involved and you get them golden Brown.

311
00:16:34.361 --> 00:16:38.740
And what happens with a waffle is you get crispy and doughy. You get,

312
00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:42.700
when you spread the, um, the syrup and the butter, you get pockets.

313
00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.640
Some have more than others. You get a different taste experience.

314
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:49.540
I'm buying into a waffle, I'm getting something real crisp on the outside.

315
00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:52.000
Then all of a sudden it's getting Shulie and fluffy and inside,

316
00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:55.600
and I'm getting the creaminess of the butter and the maple syrup.

317
00:16:55.810 --> 00:17:00.790
It's multiple textures combining for a flavor experience in my mouth that

318
00:17:00.791 --> 00:17:03.460
a pancake doesn't do. A pancake is light and fluffy,

319
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:05.260
but the consistency is the same.

320
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:07.120
And a lot of pancakes aren't made the right way.

321
00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:11.590
And it just like ends up being this real mushy maple syrup sponge.

322
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:16.450
Whereas the crispiness of the waffle holds the maple syrup from penetrating

323
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.420
through to the inside dough. And then when you bite it,

324
00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:24.010
you're still getting them in a layer of Sera, crisp dough.

325
00:17:24.011 --> 00:17:28.600
And not this just sponge disk in your mouth of pancakes.

326
00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:32.770
<v 1>I will say this, I cannot, I cannot take credit, uh,</v>

327
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:35.680
or responsibility for the people that don't know how to make the pancake

328
00:17:35.681 --> 00:17:40.000
properly. That's their problem. But when a pancake is made properly,

329
00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:45.130
it should have the consistency of moist Duncan Hines cake,

330
00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:49.770
basically. That's where you're at, except it's warm. I love it. In his greatest,

331
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:50.100
in his.

332
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.830
<v 2>Greatest state. I'm talking, telling you that the pancake is flush.</v>

333
00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:57.020
<v 1>Be it should be thin. It should never be crispier crunchy on the outside.</v>

334
00:17:57.021 --> 00:18:00.080
It should be soft and spongy to the touch and it should be thin.

335
00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:03.770
And when you cut a pancake up, may properly like that into,

336
00:18:03.771 --> 00:18:07.130
into little wedges and I cut it all up and then I butter it.

337
00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.350
So I get the butter all EV everywhere.

338
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:14.330
And then I pour syrup on the side and I poke and I dip and that's how I eat.

339
00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:16.230
And it is.

340
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.850
<v 2>I'm glad that's how you eat it, but why is it better than the waffle? Because.</v>

341
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:22.850
<v 1>Cause it's just a, it's just a more w in my opinion.</v>

342
00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:27.200
<v 2>It's a more wonderful, they sell frozen pancakes. Yes. Well,</v>

343
00:18:27.201 --> 00:18:29.870
they are not popular are. And I wonder why. Well, I mean,

344
00:18:29.871 --> 00:18:32.300
but then you don't hear people getting frozen pancakes.

345
00:18:32.301 --> 00:18:34.640
I can hear people getting frozen waffles, but my dad.

346
00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.260
<v 1>Home visiting, for instance,</v>

347
00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.790
perhaps this Christmas he'll make me pancakes grease in the morning.

348
00:18:40.791 --> 00:18:42.050
He'll make me pancakes in the morning.

349
00:18:42.051 --> 00:18:43.580
He'll make all of us pancakes in the morning.

350
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:47.930
But my point is is there's nothing like it. There's nothing like it.

351
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.790
There's pancakes or late night food.

352
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:52.550
<v 2>Something very, very like it. It's called the waffle.</v>

353
00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.890
And it's what we're debating.

354
00:18:54.891 --> 00:18:58.550
And it's why you said pancakes should go against waffle because it's,

355
00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.100
it's rightful adversary because it's so close together.

356
00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:03.860
Then bacon is so the waffle goes against it.

357
00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.560
The waffles been around for hundred and 40 years less.

358
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:09.890
And is its contemporary competitor. It's done a lot.

359
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:13.640
You have a food that was invented in the 14 hundreds at ancient Greece to

360
00:19:13.641 --> 00:19:14.474
pancake.

361
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:16.160
<v 1>The other reason I like the pancake,</v>

362
00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.090
you can make it in different ways with different ingredients.

363
00:19:20.091 --> 00:19:21.920
Like if you're on a low carb thing,

364
00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:26.690
I have a recipe where you can make pancakes out of bananas and almond flour and

365
00:19:26.691 --> 00:19:31.430
whatever. And I've never been able to do it in a waffle. Have you tried? No.

366
00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:32.270
Have you?

367
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:33.920
<v 2>Nope. Have you ever asked anyone else if they've done it? No.</v>

368
00:19:33.921 --> 00:19:37.280
I've just made the assumption. It sounds like the typical Joe DeRosa argument,

369
00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:39.350
but show me, show me.

370
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:42.350
<v 1>Uh, Mike, look up. Uh.</v>

371
00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.630
<v 2>I look at those two. Can you just go back a second?</v>

372
00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.070
If you could throw those photos out,

373
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:49.160
look at the waffles on the left of the pancakes are both look delicious again.

374
00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.400
I'm not, I don't hate pancakes, but if I had to choose,

375
00:19:52.401 --> 00:19:53.480
I'm choosing a waffle every time.

376
00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.500
Look at how those waffles it had just so much more appealing to me.

377
00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:00.410
You got the stack of pancakes, this smashing each other together.

378
00:20:00.411 --> 00:20:02.990
The same exact thing. You dumped a syrup on the top.

379
00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:07.250
If you not putting in the work to lift every flapjack or every pancake and put

380
00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:10.340
butter on everything and syrup on everything, then you just get in a big man.

381
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:14.990
The waffle it's like a leaning tower of deliciousness. There's just,

382
00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:17.840
they decided to put fruit. Does that even beep on it?

383
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:19.040
They put a little fruit on it.

384
00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:24.110
They put a little syrup on it and it's crispy golden. You're comparing.

385
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:27.770
<v 1>Picture versus one picture that I've seen tiny cakes.</v>

386
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:31.100
I've seen pancakes prepared like that with fruit and whipped cream.

387
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:33.410
<v 2>Okay. You're right. I'm comparing two pictures, but I wouldn't say, look,</v>

388
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.840
I don't care for it. Honestly. I don't get the texture.

389
00:20:35.841 --> 00:20:39.050
You're just eating a pile of sponges when you're, when you're eating a pancake.

390
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:44.000
That's the texture pancake. That's doesn't even sound good to me. Oh,

391
00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:48.310
in waffle sounds good. Waffle sounds intriguing. It sounds waffle.

392
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.300
<v 4>Waffle. What does that,</v>

393
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.120
it sounds like something that comes out of your colon is what it sounds like.

394
00:20:52.121 --> 00:20:55.650
It doesn't sound right. It sounds gross. It sounds.

395
00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:02.100
<v 2>They have waffle cones, right? You don't have a pancake cone. [inaudible].</v>

396
00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:05.760
<v 4>Do you have a pancake cake ice cream sandwich?</v>

397
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.380
<v 2>You know what else? I hate it.</v>

398
00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:10.740
I hate a waffle ice cream sandwich and you can actually hold the ice cream.

399
00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.930
What else I've had? That always sounds like a great idea.

400
00:21:12.931 --> 00:21:17.010
And then it sucks a waffle sandwich. I've gone to restaurants where it's like,

401
00:21:17.011 --> 00:21:21.060
we put two, we put a piece of fried chicken in between slices, a waffle my God,

402
00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:22.920
Oh my God. You're doing yourself a disservice.

403
00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.270
I'd never heard of the waffle sandwich,

404
00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:28.260
but I almost forgot that you could put fried chicken with waffles for one of the

405
00:21:28.261 --> 00:21:30.540
greatest meals that anyone's ever heard of in your entire life.

406
00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:34.620
I wasn't even going to bring it up and you go ahead and bring up waffles and

407
00:21:34.621 --> 00:21:36.990
fried chicken. You're not doing yourself a disservice.

408
00:21:36.991 --> 00:21:40.890
You can't have a fried chicken so much between a bunch of soft pancakes.

409
00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.260
You don't think you could have some, I mean, nobody does it, but you don't.

410
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.100
<v 4>I mean, I think it will be adjacent, but there's a reason why the time.</v>

411
00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:50.940
<v 2>Dominating dish and the original dish, and the only dish you really see is,</v>

412
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:51.790
is as.

413
00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:55.560
<v 4>Look at me, look at that pancakes. Just Google. I mean the pancake sandwich,</v>

414
00:21:55.561 --> 00:21:58.800
everything from Roscoe's go away. By the way, by the way.

415
00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:04.170
<v 2>Two, up on your high horse there, who's heard of a pancake sandwich.</v>

416
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:09.180
I'm sorry. A crepe, a crate, a crepe is not a pancake.

417
00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:10.493
It's defined.

418
00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.950
<v 4>As being a part of the pancake is a pancake. A crepe is a crepe. I mean,</v>

419
00:22:13.951 --> 00:22:17.280
crepe is you weren't. You were about to argue that that.

420
00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:19.470
<v 2>By extension you could tell me a crepe is better than.</v>

421
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:24.030
<v 4>A waffle fluffy Swedish pancakes. But buddy, when you go,</v>

422
00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:27.810
let me ask you a question. Crepes are talking about, we know the CLIA.

423
00:22:27.811 --> 00:22:31.080
Crepe is a pancake that's been thinned out.

424
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:35.760
So can we go to every single episode ever that he's done, where he says,

425
00:22:35.761 --> 00:22:38.640
you cannot adjust. You cannot leave all.

426
00:22:38.641 --> 00:22:41.280
You got to lean on the fact that you have to serve at a different way.

427
00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:44.090
I'm showing you another.

428
00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:47.880
So you contradict yourself and I'm saying it's another version of the paler

429
00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:51.300
about the version of the pancake called the crepe. Cause that's a crepe.

430
00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.630
When I go get a crate, I get a crepe. When I want a crepe back on a crepe.

431
00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:58.620
When I want to Mike, what? We're arguing here. When you do the edit,

432
00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:02.190
I want it here. Arguing. I want to hear that is thin.

433
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:06.870
It doesn't taste the same and it's not the same concept of what's so never broke

434
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:09.720
case extraordinarily the shame. Oh,

435
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:14.520
you just never eat it with syrup and butter. Are you ordering crepe versus

436
00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:18.510
talking about the traditional pancake, Joe?

437
00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:21.990
You've never you can't co-op the crepe. And now make the crates at a tag team.

438
00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:25.830
So two on one. So let me get this straight on the record.

439
00:23:25.831 --> 00:23:27.870
Let me get this straight. You are allowed.

440
00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:29.910
Let me get this straight and I'll tell you

441
00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:34.830
[inaudible] crepe Cray.

442
00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:39.130
It's going to be 99 to 1% or point counter point.

443
00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:43.980
So let me get this straight. You can do frozen waffle versus awful.

444
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:49.190
Hold on. You can do frozen wild food pancake. And you brought up Belgian waffle.

445
00:23:49.191 --> 00:23:51.470
That's a completely different version of the wall.

446
00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:57.470
The size it's the same steno. The crepe is the same thing.

447
00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:00.710
The creep is not. If I, if you close your eyes,

448
00:24:00.711 --> 00:24:03.770
I put a crepe in your mouth and I go, hi, you like my pancakes? You're gonna go.

449
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:06.650
This ain't a pancake. It's a crepe. No, that's what you gotta do.

450
00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:09.710
And you're gonna say highlights. That's how your voice is going to come. Good.

451
00:24:09.711 --> 00:24:14.270
I know you. I would say there's a thin pancake. Oh, you're dumped there. Winded.

452
00:24:14.271 --> 00:24:15.860
Colton pancakes says

453
00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:19.340
I'm going to go to a little cafe and go,

454
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:22.550
can I have an espresso and a little pancake please?

455
00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.450
The crepe crepe. When your affects come up on the internet,

456
00:24:26.451 --> 00:24:28.610
their facts are when mine come up, you go, they don't count.

457
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.630
Why are waffles better? Let's go back. Let's just go.

458
00:24:32.631 --> 00:24:35.930
Let's just see popular convention. Answer my question about the crape.

459
00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:38.510
Why wouldn't you see the factual information?

460
00:24:38.511 --> 00:24:41.870
A crepe is part of the pancake family is considered a thin pancake.

461
00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:46.100
Does that not count as fact as it? You so,

462
00:24:46.101 --> 00:24:47.030
so what you're,

463
00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:51.230
what you're telling me right now is you're contending that creeps can be as

464
00:24:51.231 --> 00:24:55.550
equal a part of this argument versus waffles. Absolutely. Oh my God.

465
00:24:55.790 --> 00:25:00.260
When you're talking about bringing change the rules, it's not a rule change.

466
00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:04.070
We can't get anywhere. Fin pancakes. And you use them to put away.

467
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:08.930
When I say the word pancake does a crepe come to mind? No. Oh, Joe,

468
00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:13.850
please. It did. Saxo say I'm starving. I want to get some pancakes.

469
00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:16.960
What w what are you saying? And what do I think you're getting okay, fine. If I,

470
00:25:16.961 --> 00:25:21.050
if I'm at a local cafe and I say, Oh, I'm going to get a crepe and a coffee.

471
00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.320
Okay. Am I getting her a stack of silver dollar pancakes? You know,

472
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:25.970
have you ever gone to a crepe restaurant?

473
00:25:25.971 --> 00:25:28.190
People eat them with butter and syrup like pancakes.

474
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:30.830
They believe that if you want to order, if you want to fight crepe first,

475
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.770
while you want to go to creepers, while I go, I'll delete. I'll delete.

476
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:37.400
I'll do Creek Creek. I'll leave it. I'll do it right now.

477
00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:39.170
I'll do something that's unprecedented.

478
00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:43.160
I'll do crepe versus waffle right now and give you

479
00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:50.120
a 10%. I'll give you, I'll give you a tender, wave it around.

480
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:53.630
I will give you a 10% handicap. I'll go. No, you know what?

481
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:55.910
I'll give you a 20% handicap. Give me a,

482
00:25:55.970 --> 00:26:00.650
I will give you a 20% handicap on creepers waffle. Stop with the question. Okay?

483
00:26:00.651 --> 00:26:02.960
Then you can't count Belgium waffles. Then,

484
00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.110
then you can't count Belgium because that's a vaguer. Well,

485
00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:10.460
let's just say for the sake of this versus roll your eyes at it.

486
00:26:10.461 --> 00:26:14.510
If little pancakes don't count giant waffles don't count. That's it.

487
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:19.040
But the creep is not the same as the pant is it just said on the screen,

488
00:26:19.041 --> 00:26:23.870
it's a thin pancake. It's just said it's in theory. Oh my God, Mike,

489
00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:28.850
please go to the crepes Wikipedia page. It says it right there.

490
00:26:28.851 --> 00:26:31.340
It's made on a cast iron griddle. It's a pancake.

491
00:26:31.341 --> 00:26:33.260
That's been thinned out and stuffed,

492
00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:38.210
but thinner waffle is still cold and waffle. Oh,

493
00:26:38.211 --> 00:26:41.060
excuse me. Can you beat that? Oh my God.

494
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:45.510
Grape is also the French name for a pancake. Alright, well,

495
00:26:45.511 --> 00:26:49.800
I don't go a waffle something else. Frigid means pancake,

496
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.820
but you're not battling the preparation of a crepe battling the classic.

497
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.390
You know what he does when he wants me, I put.

498
00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:59.640
<v 2>It in classic ice cream sandwich, traditional ice cream.</v>

499
00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.640
<v 4>Sandwich, original. Blah-blah-blah when he doesn't want me to,</v>

500
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:06.630
he just puts pancake. And now traditional pancake is out the window.

501
00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:09.510
If I would have wrote traditional pancake versus traditional waffle,

502
00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:11.520
would that make you happier? Well, guess what I mean?

503
00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:15.270
I guess when I say traditional waffle people saying, put a diner Belgian,

504
00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:18.360
WAFs just to prove my point, Mike, just to prove my point and show them.

505
00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:21.950
<v 2>I'm a fair sport. More than fair. Wait, wait. Don't don't wait, wait, wait.</v>

506
00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:23.660
Don't go off yet. Let me read this. Okay.

507
00:27:23.661 --> 00:27:27.560
Mike crepes are thinner in larger than an English pancake.

508
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:29.420
They usually have Richard ingredients.

509
00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:33.120
<v 4>Food and sugar and or cream, and are only cooked on one side. Okay? Okay. So, so</v>

510
00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:38.330
I'm trying to do something to your benefit. Hold on.

511
00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:42.170
You could argue that it's prepared differently. So technically doesn't count.

512
00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:44.600
I want you to show me now how a Belgian Warren.

513
00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:49.790
<v 2>Is prepared. Same as irregular waffle. It's just bigger. It's the same thing.</v>

514
00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:53.270
When I say traditional waffle people think, Oh, the waffle I get at the diner,

515
00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:54.530
that's a Belgian waffles.

516
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:59.420
Waffles are thicker and often larger because they're made in a waffle iron that

517
00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.840
is deeper Gritch to build your waffles.

518
00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:04.340
Also made a little differently than regular waffles.

519
00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:10.130
<v 4>Justin, with a li li leavening agent or egg whites use to make the</v>

520
00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.010
batter light and fluffy. It doesn't count. It's out.

521
00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.020
My point being is that a Belgian.

522
00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.060
<v 2>Waffle is called a waffle. You don't.</v>

523
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:18.800
<v 4>I mean, that's ridiculous.</v>

524
00:28:18.801 --> 00:28:22.550
Sal that's ridiculous called something different things saying it's like saying,

525
00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:26.420
uh, uh, uh, a cabasa is in part of the sausage family.

526
00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:28.100
Cause it's called a cabasa. I mean, that's crazy.

527
00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:30.800
<v 2>Right? Hold on. If I come back to that diner and I go and you go, Hey,</v>

528
00:28:30.801 --> 00:28:32.570
what'd you do? And I got, I went to the dining to go what'd you eat? And I go,

529
00:28:32.571 --> 00:28:36.740
I eat a waffle. Right? You know what I'm talking about? Yeah. Okay. That,

530
00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:38.390
that ate a waffle.

531
00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.450
<v 4>And I, you know what I said, you know what I say? Ready?</v>

532
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.720
You want me to say let's do it ready? Hey sir. Where, where are you just now?

533
00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:49.220
I know I got one. No, no, no, no, no, no. I had another one. Okay.

534
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:52.850
The wait to do it though. I'm ready. Okay. Okay. Ready? So we're worried.

535
00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:57.680
<v 2>How was that? My local diner. What'd you Jeff today? Yeah. I had a, a waffle,</v>

536
00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:03.140
just one. Cause they're tiny. Just one waffle. Now the dynam off was a pig. Oh,

537
00:29:03.141 --> 00:29:07.070
you had a Belgian waffle. It's different. Well, it's a waffle. Yeah,

538
00:29:07.071 --> 00:29:10.960
but it's different. Hold on, Joe. I just got back from the diner and boy,

539
00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:14.630
my stuffed. Right. But I took her to go container. It's not clear.

540
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:18.140
It's it's plastic. You can't see what's in it. Okay. I had pancakes. Right?

541
00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:22.160
You want them open it up? Boom. It's for crepes. What do you say to me?

542
00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:29.780
<v 4>You say, I thought you said pancakes. Grape. That's what you would say.</v>

543
00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:34.880
You would not open it. Go. Jeez. Delicious tea.

544
00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:36.440
People understand you.

545
00:29:36.441 --> 00:29:41.030
Jealous saw you are saying is, is Belgium waffle.

546
00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:44.830
Hold on. Hold. Crepe does. Hold on, babe. Hold on. Ready, Joe.

547
00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:49.420
How are you this morning? Great. Guess where? I just came from the crepe place.

548
00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.890
The diner. Oh great. You know what? I had crepes. I had waffles. Oh good.

549
00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:57.490
I actually have extra waffles here. Cause I was so hungry here. Open it.

550
00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:01.480
When you open it, are you going to go? This is not a waffle. No,

551
00:30:01.481 --> 00:30:05.440
you're going to go. Oh. I don't know what I'm looking at. An invisible thing.

552
00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:11.690
A Belgian waffle a Belgian. Whenever I go. And I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

553
00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.920
That's not my point. That's not my point.

554
00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:19.120
I have a to go container. It's it's it's opaque.

555
00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:22.000
You can't see through it. Is that what it's called? Yes.

556
00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.820
You can't see through it. I say, Joe, you say, what'd you eat today?

557
00:30:24.821 --> 00:30:27.610
I said I had waffles. I, there was so great. I had so many. I took some home.

558
00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:29.920
Would you like some? You say yes. I hand you it.

559
00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:33.490
You open the to go container that you can't see inside until that moment when

560
00:30:33.491 --> 00:30:35.890
you open it, your brain will confirm. Oh yeah,

561
00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.110
those are the waffles he was talking about. And then you will eat the waffles.

562
00:30:38.111 --> 00:30:42.280
You will not go. This is not a waffle. Flip it. Reverse it, smack it down.

563
00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:46.120
[inaudible] I'll tell you exactly how I'll tell you right now. I had a

564
00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:49.421
[inaudible] pancakes here,

565
00:30:49.421 --> 00:30:52.030
me to crave Tacome pancakes and I'll show you exactly how I had a stack of

566
00:30:52.031 --> 00:30:56.680
pancakes. You open it up. It's two crepes in that you would go,

567
00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:01.570
Hey pig. You said pantry. I would go now. You know what I would do? Show me,

568
00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:06.010
show me. Good morning, Joe. Good morning. Hand me the paper.

569
00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.050
I want to start off on a nice, we went to diner,

570
00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:11.800
South accusing me of being an alibi.

571
00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:17.860
He said good morning. And my in my, in my Jefferson breakfast, yay.

572
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:20.050
Breakfast will come to you. Would you have pancakes?

573
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:25.300
A lot of them so many I can't eat anymore. That's weird because they're so tiny.

574
00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:32.560
You want some of my patients? This is my pancakes. That's weird, Mike.

575
00:31:32.561 --> 00:31:34.540
It's weird that he calls them pancakes. Traditionally,

576
00:31:34.541 --> 00:31:37.990
people say these are crepes, but technically they are pancakes now. Oh,

577
00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:41.260
good job. Your argument on a technicality.

578
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:45.940
His whole argument based on a technicality knowledge. If crepe,

579
00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.980
stoke camped in Belgium waffles.

580
00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.850
So cause Belgian waffles are also made differently. Hearing what you're saying.

581
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.710
And I'm counter pointing by saying,

582
00:31:53.711 --> 00:31:57.550
if I told you I went to the diner and had a waffle of my [inaudible] container,

583
00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:01.210
I just had a stroke and you opened it. No, it was a Belgium waffle.

584
00:32:01.211 --> 00:32:04.630
You would go as advertised. If I did the same thing,

585
00:32:04.631 --> 00:32:07.980
you'd have to remark out loud. You would have to remark that. Oh,

586
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:10.720
these are crepes. I guess it's like a pancake,

587
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:14.710
but I thought you meant the other thing. Here's not basing my argument on that.

588
00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:18.550
Okay. I think it's stupid.

589
00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:23.340
<v 1>It's like saying this. It's like saying this.</v>

590
00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.210
<v 4>I feel [inaudible]. I feel,</v>

591
00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:30.210
let me say my thing before you say irrational.

592
00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:34.500
<v 1>You're just going to say it. Let me say my thing. It's like saying salsa.</v>

593
00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:38.190
Isn't a dip because it's called salsa and you go. Yeah,

594
00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:39.950
because that's just what call it.

595
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.370
<v 4>From where it comes from. It's a dance,</v>

596
00:32:42.371 --> 00:32:45.410
a little more of a blurred line and a little more of a blurred line.

597
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:49.070
It is in the dead. Something into salsa. Yes.

598
00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:54.170
I don't necessarily syrup on crave for Christ sakes. You commie bastard.

599
00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.610
You don't. Yes.

600
00:32:55.611 --> 00:33:00.350
You do get some type of a straw Berry terms. You do.

601
00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:03.350
You would get hazelnut and banana. Sometimes I get ham.

602
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:05.440
<v 7>And cheese in the middle of the things. You.</v>

603
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:10.100
<v 4>Know what? I never get chocolate chips or blueberries. If you saw pimps face.</v>

604
00:33:10.101 --> 00:33:12.560
When you just said that again, you just pulled,

605
00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:17.000
you pulled the rug out from your own two silly feet

606
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:22.760
because nobody eats a pancake with ham and cheese sandwich.

607
00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:24.020
There was exhibit a,

608
00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:27.650
there was a pancake breakfast sandwich earlier that I tried to point out to you,

609
00:33:27.651 --> 00:33:29.810
but you, because you're so good at multitasking.

610
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:31.910
You didn't notice it because your eyes were

611
00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:36.850
looking at you can Google. Uh, you can go.

612
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:40.370
You can Google red wing boot in between two pancakes.

613
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:44.360
I love and see a Joe Google red wing boot in between two pancakes.

614
00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:54.430
My point though, my point, dad, look at that.

615
00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:56.050
But my point though,

616
00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:00.850
that I'm not saying it doesn't look good.

617
00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:04.570
I'm saying that that nobody goes to a store and says, I just, when,

618
00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.510
when a waitress comes over and goes eight doll and she pulls a pencil out from

619
00:34:07.511 --> 00:34:10.540
behind her ear and she goes, I guess she goes to write down. She goes,

620
00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:13.390
I'll have a stack of pancakes. She goes show, would you like anything on that?

621
00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:18.280
I never, no one goes, of course, ham and cheese.

622
00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:20.530
Nobody says that to a regular traditional pancake.

623
00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:25.600
The fact that you can be like, I have great crape.

624
00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:30.100
The crepe is meant for something different than a traditional.

625
00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:34.120
It's a thinner pancake. That's made slightly differently.

626
00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:38.200
And if it doesn't count the need or does the Belgian waffle Joe's favorite

627
00:34:38.201 --> 00:34:39.034
pancake,

628
00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:43.720
a Belgian waffle sandwich quickie while we're regular waffles,

629
00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:47.980
you need a Belgian waffle. No, your knocks it's too big. You can't do it.

630
00:34:48.910 --> 00:34:50.380
I don't even want to say in your argument anymore,

631
00:34:50.410 --> 00:34:52.870
you were bragging earlier about how you could make a Belgium.

632
00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:56.440
You can make a waffle sandwich and you could never do that with a pancake.

633
00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.980
And I said, yes, you can get rid of a crepe and you should crave some count.

634
00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.870
You're going to make a Belgian waffle sandwich.

635
00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.820
You're going to Belgian waffle show.

636
00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:05.320
That would be ridiculous because they had this big,

637
00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:08.410
but I would take a triangle of it. It over.

638
00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.410
<v 8>Slice of bread. Oh, okay.</v>

639
00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:16.570
Really? All right. Let's go to the polls. Really?

640
00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:18.690
<v 4>Wait, wait, hold on. Hold on, hold on. Let's just go.</v>

641
00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:22.690
So you know Joe's favorite pancakes are ham and cheese pancakes. No,

642
00:35:22.691 --> 00:35:25.490
I didn't say that. Yeah. That's not what I said, Joe Love Joe.

643
00:35:25.491 --> 00:35:29.020
Joe is one of my favorite pancakes is ham and cheese pancakes.

644
00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.240
You said you love to put it on him. I didn't say that.

645
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:34.570
You said the words I love to put on him and used say that I love to have my

646
00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:39.060
crazy. He said, I like, yes. Great. And say, what's my favorite pancake.

647
00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:43.590
You said on our milk whipped butter and maple syrup pancake, bro. Okay.

648
00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:48.720
Well what you said it isn't five inches thick. There you go.

649
00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:53.400
But it's still just a waffle. You're putting still just a pancake.

650
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:57.870
It's a thin pancake times like these that I wish we had a third party. Holy.

651
00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:01.170
You saw it on the internet with your own two eyes.

652
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.320
I'm craving ham and cheese pancakes all day at night. Can't wait. Can't wait.

653
00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:06.360
I can't wait for it said it looked delicious.

654
00:36:06.361 --> 00:36:08.770
When you saw the picture of it with the regular pig cake,

655
00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:12.390
nobody says the phrase, I'm going to go get some ham and cheese pancakes.

656
00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:15.570
Nobody says the phrase, get a Belgian waffle sandwich. Okay.

657
00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:19.890
What we're doing here is a wasting time arguing points that don't make extra

658
00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:21.960
matters is that waffles are taken to the polls.

659
00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:25.280
<v 1>Taking the polls. Let's see what we got here. Let's see what we got here.</v>

660
00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:29.900
Humble pie time. Humble pie time like this anymore.

661
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:32.360
You love it. What do we got?

662
00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:37.760
<v 4>Seven. [inaudible] sorry.</v>

663
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:41.750
Bleak that we've done. It's 51 49. I can't do this.

664
00:36:41.751 --> 00:36:44.510
We have to wait another couple of minutes till close to call

665
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:49.490
50.9%.

666
00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.610
Pancakes takes waffles at

667
00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:56.780
0.9%. Don't even say 51. What?

668
00:36:56.781 --> 00:37:00.890
It is 0.9%. Let it staying the way it should.

669
00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:06.950
Percent should show you that you have you're completely off the Mark.

670
00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:08.060
I'm not off the Mark.

671
00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:13.490
The goal isn't to be more on the Mark than not the goal is to win the debate I

672
00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.350
wanted to bait. I'm right.

673
00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.360
<v 1>Pancakes. One, my food one.</v>

674
00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:20.300
Let's see what some comments are and we'll keep checking in.

675
00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:23.570
<v 4>What is that? It's two feet.</v>

676
00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.940
<v 1>With jelly on them. It's really gross.</v>

677
00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:31.250
[inaudible] I'm saying you're the peanut butter. Joey roses is the jelly. Oh,

678
00:37:31.251 --> 00:37:34.280
I see. It's a foot with peanut butter. Let me tell you something right now.

679
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:36.710
Let me tell you something right now. That's a nice way.

680
00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:45.080
<v 4>59, 51 49. You cannot, you cannot begin to gloat the way you're gloating.</v>

681
00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:49.640
Are you kidding? I mean, in, in five minutes, in five minutes,

682
00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:53.450
this could be the other way. Could you, so don't close like that. Why?

683
00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:54.770
And also by the way,

684
00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:58.760
I think this is a win for me because pancakes is way,

685
00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:02.420
way more popular. Pancakes are way more. They were the front runner.

686
00:38:02.421 --> 00:38:06.170
They were the favorite to come this close under 1%.

687
00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:11.720
Nobody did when cakes sip it around since 1430.

688
00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:17.930
So the 15 hundreds got nothing to do with the way the show is still wrapped

689
00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:22.940
around 440 years after the pancake.

690
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.850
And we are under a percentage sky Dalton.

691
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:29.420
<v 1>I think it's a doll. I guess that's a man. I can't see the picture.</v>

692
00:38:29.421 --> 00:38:31.880
I don't know if that's a male or female name, but anyway, Dalton says,

693
00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:36.280
talk about, speak in my language. Pancakes are they are Eggo.

694
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:40.210
<v 4>Waffles. Almost my exact argument.</v>

695
00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:45.180
<v 2>With my heart on the line. It all caps. Oh my God.</v>

696
00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:50.940
Someone just wrote option C French toast.

697
00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:54.930
I know French toast enters the chat. I know about French toast.

698
00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:58.050
That would have been a great three-way episode. Pancakes, waffles, French toast.

699
00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.840
It would have been. Cause I got news for ya. We might rematch.

700
00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:04.530
I got news for you. I think French toast is like a dark horse here.

701
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:09.420
I really think French toast is, is, is how did we not think of French toast?

702
00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.700
<v 4>I thought of it through out the entire argument.</v>

703
00:39:11.701 --> 00:39:15.270
I just decided not to bring it up. No, it's weird.

704
00:39:15.271 --> 00:39:17.250
It's complicated enough already with this.

705
00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:22.410
<v 2>French crepe French toast, our French toast is just a pancake.</v>

706
00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:26.100
You pop in my head a few times. I didn't want to complicate things.

707
00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:27.890
<v 1>Because it was like, we were we're, you know, we're,</v>

708
00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:29.750
that's not what we were debating. And,

709
00:39:29.751 --> 00:39:33.030
and it couldn't support either of our foods. You know what I mean?

710
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:35.790
This race is closer than Biden and Trump.

711
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:40.680
<v 2>Waffles period, waffles, hands down, pancakes too. Fluffy enough for me,</v>

712
00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:42.360
depends.

713
00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:45.090
<v 1>And uh, fluffy, blueberry pancakes for breakfast,</v>

714
00:39:45.091 --> 00:39:48.810
but I do love good chicken and waffles for dinner. Wait, go back.

715
00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:52.050
I need 24 hours. I need 24 hour prep.

716
00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:55.020
If I'm going to have pancakes in the morning, waffles are a little easier.

717
00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:59.940
<v 2>Waffles are just pancakes with some actual texture and contrast great,</v>

718
00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:01.620
uh.

719
00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:05.100
<v 1>Homemade waffles, greater than pancakes, greater than frozen waffles.</v>

720
00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:10.680
<v 2>I'd honestly take a frozen waffle over a fresh pancake any day. Look,</v>

721
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:11.160
you heard it.

722
00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:14.130
<v 1>My argument about frozen waffles. I'll bang out a whole box of Eggos, right?</v>

723
00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:17.370
<v 2>Yeah. He's someone, very reasonable. Waffles are more reliable,</v>

724
00:40:17.371 --> 00:40:19.350
but pancakes are better when done. Right?

725
00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:23.400
You're a person that I can have a dialogue with, sir. Okay. Well.

726
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.410
<v 1>I love how it's written to just you. Like,</v>

727
00:40:25.411 --> 00:40:29.790
it's just you here talking to yourself for an hour. Just pointing out a point.

728
00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.580
<v 2>It resonated with me. You don't have to gloat even more. By the way,</v>

729
00:40:32.581 --> 00:40:35.370
if we refresh right now, I may be a winner. All right. Refresh.

730
00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:40.680
If you were frustrating now, but it made me be a winner. Oh my God.

731
00:40:40.681 --> 00:40:43.780
It's less than a. Now it's 0.7%, babe.

732
00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:47.130
<v 4>The footsteps you hear him or do you hear the footsteps?</v>

733
00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:49.320
And pancakes was the front runner.

734
00:40:49.321 --> 00:40:52.990
I know you're getting down to a half of a percentage of shame that we got to

735
00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:57.150
come on base basis. Shame. We got to end the episode. This is one of them.

736
00:40:57.780 --> 00:40:59.730
I feel like this is the stretch. And it's like, Hey,

737
00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:02.730
comes waffled on the inside. I'll tell you what show. I bet you really.

738
00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:06.000
<v 1>Great asking for that extra hour of sleep right now because had we started an</v>

739
00:41:06.001 --> 00:41:09.180
hour earlier, we wouldn't be so pressed for time right now, would we?

740
00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.100
And we have to end the episode.

741
00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:13.890
<v 4>Folks. Pancakes is the winner.</v>

742
00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:17.550
Who did he pick him and who is our great, uh, you gotta give me something.

743
00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:20.130
I'll give it to scroll down. Mike. I want to give it to this.

744
00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:24.270
<v 1>Person right here because it's so close to what you said. I'm gonna just say it.</v>

745
00:41:24.271 --> 00:41:26.070
I hate pancakes. I will not eat pancakes.

746
00:41:26.071 --> 00:41:29.820
It's like eating a syrup covered sponge. That's so close to what you said.

747
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:30.743
We got to give it to them.

748
00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:35.990
<v 4>That goes to, to, to Shelly. Think it's pronounced at real Moses tweets.</v>

749
00:41:35.991 --> 00:41:40.940
You can follow Shelly at real Moses tweet, uh, come by the Joey Rosa sandwich.

750
00:41:40.941 --> 00:41:44.870
Shop 12 to four, Wednesday to Friday at the stand in New York city. Uh,

751
00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:49.790
Joe Rosa comedy on Instagram and Twitter. Yes, that's it. I love it.

752
00:41:49.791 --> 00:41:52.190
I hope you guys have been enjoying the taste buds pod.

753
00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:57.080
We are toying with the idea of doing a live streaming episode on YouTube where

754
00:41:57.081 --> 00:42:01.160
you guys can have this entire conversation with us in the moment. Uh,

755
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:04.100
if so we will let you know when that's going to be, uh,

756
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:05.330
we think it's going to be a blast.

757
00:42:05.331 --> 00:42:08.240
So it's something that we're really looking forward to. What else?

758
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:11.300
Just go to the YouTube is no pressure network on YouTube. That's a channel.

759
00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:15.170
We can find a, Hey babe, the other podcast. And uh, yeah,

763
00:42:21.981 --> 00:42:25.040
the best thing that I think you could do for us is to share it and rate it,

764
00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:25.311

765
00:42:25.311 --> 00:42:28.910
Like on any anywhere you're watching or listening to it or wherever you could

766
00:42:28.911 --> 00:42:32.690
share it and rate it, subscribe, all those things that really, really,

767
00:42:32.691 --> 00:42:34.790
really helps us. That's like the most immediate way.

768
00:42:34.791 --> 00:42:38.390
