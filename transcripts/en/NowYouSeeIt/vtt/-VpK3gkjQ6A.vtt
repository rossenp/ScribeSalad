00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.110
<v 1>Let's start the show.</v>

5
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.510
<v 2>So different and he sold him. But the freedom,</v>

6
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.550
if you wanted to have a legend of a comedian,

7
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.140
you talk about a guy who created the greatest sketch show of all time.

8
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.210
Then he goes away and the show went really well. Like absurdly. Well, like so,

9
00:00:41.211 --> 00:00:43.040
well you got to go to Africa.

10
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.420
<v 1>Well, I quit Chappelle show in spectacular, fast. Hey,</v>

11
00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:51.860
everybody got an in the night. I quit.

12
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.410
<v 2>It goes away like a mountain.</v>

13
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.640
<v 0>Excuse me to us. This is for 10 years, I was gone.</v>

14
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.250
<v 1>I watched the world go on without me. I'm born the laws of it.</v>

15
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.200
<v 2>And then came back and immediately went right to the top.</v>

16
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.550
No one's ever done it better than Dave.

17
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.530
He sat in the time where the fire is the hottest I'm going to do what

18
00:01:18.531 --> 00:01:22.040
nobody else will. Dave, you're the goat.

19
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.010
<v 1>Dave Chappelle.</v>

20
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.213
Anyway,

21
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.400
this is weird and less than ideal.

22
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.570
<v 0>Dave Chappelle special eight 46 reminded us all. What we already knew,</v>

23
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.290
Chappelle is more than just a comedian. He's a legend and an iconic figure.

24
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.120
Just one who also tells jokes.

25
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.710
<v 1>Personally, kit Candace Owens in her stinky.</v>

26
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.880
<v 0>This performance shows Dave's incredible flexibility as an artist.</v>

27
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.210
Not only was it filmed in the middle of a pandemic that has prevented standup

28
00:02:02.211 --> 00:02:04.460
comedy for months, but in his own words.

29
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.930
<v 1>Not funny at all.</v>

30
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.160
<v 0>The special only has a little bit of humor in it.</v>

31
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.820
And the rest contains a powerful and personal reflection on the black lives

32
00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:14.840
matter protests.

33
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.980
The performance reminds you of just how legendary Dave Chappelle is that he can

34
00:02:18.981 --> 00:02:22.490
use his artistry in the most unexpected ways to do stand up in the most

35
00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:25.310
unexpected situations. And he's always been this way.

36
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.470
He did the same thing after quitting Chappelle show,

37
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.080
he was doing stand-up in a park in Seattle.

38
00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:32.210
He'd show up with a box and just do it,

39
00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:35.990
plug a microphone into it and just start doing Stanhope throughout his life.

40
00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:39.500
Chappelle has made more out of his career than just telling jokes and in doing

41
00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:42.080
so, he's become more than a comedian. He's a legend,

42
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.380
the risk taking the pressure, the comeback, the controversy,

43
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.590
it all points to an Epic narrative that transcends his own life.

44
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.840
It's a story of a man perfecting his artistry,

45
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.830
reaffirming his personal agency and learning to perform his art on his own

46
00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:59.000
terms. And it's a story that's influenced by and adds to the narratives of other

47
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.970
African-American artists.

48
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.630
Pretty much every article or video about Dave Chappelle focuses on the jokes he

49
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:06.670
tells and to whether they're funny or not funny.

50
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.610
And that makes sense since joke telling is the comedian's job.

51
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.680
But I think that sells Dave Chappelle shorts.

52
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.100
If he's really a legend and a thought leader, shouldn't we go deeper than that.

53
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.270
What if you study Dave's life and body of work as if he were a legendary artists

54
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.190
like Charlie Parker or Kendrick Lamar,

55
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.470
or even an intellectual like Frederick Douglas,

56
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.590
because I think Dave Chappelle deserves to be treated in that way.

57
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.740
There's an incredible amount of meaning and depth packed into his career,

58
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.060
along with the jokes.

59
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.950
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

60
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.010
<v 0>So let's see what Dave Chappelle's body of work looks like when you approach it.</v>

61
00:03:38.011 --> 00:03:39.990
As more than just the work of a joke teller.

62
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.780
<v 2>An iconic figure. I'm a pop culture figures.</v>

63
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.540
That's much different. I don't know.

64
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.600
Sometimes they take time and figure it began me to clap.

65
00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.560
[inaudible].

66
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.160
<v 0>In 2002, Dave Chappelle co-created Chappelle show with Neil Brennan,</v>

67
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.340
which would go on to become one of the most successful sketch comedy shows of

68
00:04:05.341 --> 00:04:07.590
all time. But in the middle of filming the third season,

69
00:04:07.591 --> 00:04:11.880
he abandoned his $50 million contract and went to South Africa for a few weeks.

70
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.750
I already made a video about why Dave Chappelle left his show on comedy central.

71
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.150
I talked about an analogy he made in his special,

72
00:04:18.151 --> 00:04:21.060
the bird revelation in the analogy. Chappelle is a prostitute.

73
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.250
His sex work is his work on Chappelle show.

74
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.150
And his pimps are the Hollywood executives who manipulated him into overworking

75
00:04:27.151 --> 00:04:30.600
under abusive conditions, pale show, 20 hours a day.

76
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.870
<v 2>Sleep for like half an hour. Raise my kids for 10, 20 minutes.</v>

77
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.020
And it wasn't fun at all. It was hard.

78
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.590
We'd have to stay awake for 48 hours at a time just to keep up with the

79
00:04:40.591 --> 00:04:43.380
schedule. We were bombed out and depleted. We were lumped in.

80
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.830
<v 0>According to the bird revelation Chapelle left the show because of that</v>

81
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.940
unbearable schedule and to the psychological abuse executive used to try to keep

82
00:04:50.941 --> 00:04:51.750
him going.

83
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.980
<v 2>Why the you think most of us work from nine to five? It's nine to six,</v>

84
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.940
my killer.

85
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.850
<v 0>But Chappelle has also mentioned other reasons for quitting. Hmm.</v>

86
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.800
<v 2>Wondered about its impact on the audience that he meant it for.</v>

87
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.700
<v 0>He felt disturbed at how some white audience members misread his racial humor.</v>

88
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:09.683
So.

89
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.330
<v 2>There was white laugh in such a way.</v>

90
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.190
I know different people laughing with me and people laughing at me and was the

91
00:05:17.191 --> 00:05:20.850
first time I'd ever gotten a laugh that I was uncomfortable with.

92
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.730
Why people would come well to me like, man, that just gets you did about them.

93
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.680
That was her luck. Take it easy.

94
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.880
You start to realize these sketches in the wrong hands are dangerous.

95
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.880
<v 0>Really? There wasn't one singular reason for him to leave.</v>

96
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.410
<v 2>I wasn't walking away from money. I was walking away from the perfect storm of.</v>

97
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.240
<v 0>And unsurprisingly,</v>

98
00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:45.960
the media didn't understand the nuance of his decision with mainstream outlets,

99
00:05:45.961 --> 00:05:49.290
circulating crazy unfounded claims about his disappearance.

100
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.640
<v 2>Saying, you know, yes, no crack. And it was all in your window.</v>

101
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.190
And then magazine is credible as Newsweek. I was surprised.

102
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.980
<v 0>The media didn't see that his decision wasn't a meltdown,</v>

103
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.940
but rather a calculated personal decision that defined his identity going

104
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:05.774
forward.

105
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.080
<v 2>I'm like, man, I didn't. I walked down. I walked back down, Wayne.</v>

106
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.860
<v 0>Aaron himself to John Wayne shows that Chappelle sees his decision as more</v>

107
00:06:14.861 --> 00:06:17.590
significant than just leaving a job. He didn't like,

108
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.190
like John Wayne disappearing into the wilderness in the searchers Chappelle

109
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.580
exercise, complete control despite his uncertain destiny.

110
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.860
<v 2>And your price in the beginning,</v>

111
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.150
if it ever gets more expensive than the pricing name, get out of it.

112
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:33.430
The effort.

113
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.040
<v 0>There's a long tradition of African-American icons,</v>

114
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.740
visiting Africa and undergoing a transformation.

115
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.110
<v 2>Everybody should go home to Africa.</v>

116
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.700
That's the all colors of people doing everything. And if I said, do you see any?

117
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.190
I said, no. As a, you know why? Because there aren't any,

118
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.660
and it hit me like a shot, man.

119
00:06:55.661 --> 00:06:58.180
I started crying and on this pilgrimage.

120
00:06:58.181 --> 00:07:02.590
What I have seen and experienced has forced me to rearrange much of my thought

121
00:07:02.591 --> 00:07:06.760
patterns previously held and to toss aside some of my previous conclusions.

122
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:10.000
Yeah, you hear a lot of black people say this, like when you go to Africa,

123
00:07:10.001 --> 00:07:13.630
especially your first time you have this overwhelming feeling like you're home,

124
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.600
which is true. I, I, I had a feeling like, man, this feels like home.

125
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.600
<v 0>And liking the narratives of other prominent black figures.</v>

126
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.830
Chappelle presents his journey to Africa as a profound teachable moment in his

127
00:07:23.831 --> 00:07:27.520
life that protested against the hostilities of show business and racial

128
00:07:27.521 --> 00:07:28.354
injustice.

129
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:33.580
<v 2>I feel like I'm going to be some kind of parable by either what you're</v>

130
00:07:33.581 --> 00:07:37.030
supposed to do or what you're not supposed to. I'm going to beat something.

131
00:07:37.031 --> 00:07:40.450
I'm either going to be a legend or just that tragic story,

132
00:07:40.451 --> 00:07:42.310
but I'm going full throttle. I'm going on away.

133
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:44.290
<v 0>Choice to go to South Africa.</v>

134
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.920
And the way he talks about that choice clearly shows he sees his decision as

135
00:07:47.921 --> 00:07:50.380
more meaningful than just a career move. Even now,

136
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:54.220
after leaving show business for 10 years, he presents his life as a parable,

137
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:58.420
a narrative to learn from and in doing so he elevates his story into myth.

138
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.840
<v 3>Look at Boone's always have a secret supply of water.</v>

139
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.390
And they're not going to tell anybody where it is.

140
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:11.460
<v 2>I watched one of these nature shows one time and they were talking about how a</v>

141
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:15.070
Bush man finds water when it's scares.

142
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.530
And they do what's called assault.

143
00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:17.531
<v 3>First.</v>

144
00:08:17.531 --> 00:08:21.610
He laborious it drills a hole in a giant antique when he is shored up a boot and

145
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.210
is watching him because he knows, but boons are incurably. Inquisitive.

146
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.560
<v 2>Put a lump of salt in a hole and they wait for the bat. Boom.</v>

147
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.520
The baboons comes, sticking his hand in the hole, grabs the salt.

148
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.550
Salt makes the have bigger and he's trapped. He can't get his hand out.

149
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:40.180
That'd be smart. All he does is let go with assault.

150
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:42.670
BABEN doesn't want to let go of stuff.

151
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.160
<v 3>Now he lets go. When it's too late.</v>

152
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.240
<v 2>Which man is comes, takes the bathroom and gives him all the salt he wants.</v>

153
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:51.280
You know, when you're a guy that generates money,

154
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.260
people have a vested interest in control.

155
00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:57.090
<v 3>In fact, he has such a bully salt that he completely forgets.</v>

156
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.140
He's under arrest and that in a little while, he's going to be a mighty thirsty,

157
00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:01.880
but baboon.

158
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.090
<v 4>You know what kills more black people than anything. One police and terrorism,</v>

159
00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:09.650
salt Lake, a regular table. Salt with that bone gets thirsty.

160
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:10.790
The Bush man, that's somebody.

161
00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.490
<v 3>He decides the brainwashing has worked.</v>

162
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.760
So he sets him free knowing that in his condition,

163
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.460
he won't care who follows him to the seat. But reservoir.

164
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:21.980
<v 4>That wasn't paying attention.</v>

165
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.170
I felt really guilty about being asleep at the wheel.

166
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.890
The first piece of bamboo runs to his water, which may have followed him.

167
00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.210
And they both turned to them. And then that analogy, I felt like the boom,

168
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:34.130
but I was smart enough to let go of it.

169
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:37.790
<v 3>If you had to say to drop the seed, he could feel his hand.</v>

170
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:41.180
<v 4>I want to give the money to someone that's not exploiting.</v>

171
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.810
The machine is good for us and we good for the machine. Then it should be,

172
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.630
should be fair, man. Should it be fair?

173
00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.510
You know what? Uh, it's been 10 years.

174
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.700
Since the last time I played Los Angeles.

175
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.760
<v 0>2017 Chappelle released his first two posts,</v>

176
00:10:01.761 --> 00:10:03.920
Chappelle show concert films on Netflix,

177
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.520
deep in the heart of Texas and the age of spin while they don't linger much on

178
00:10:07.521 --> 00:10:09.620
his past controversies with Chappelle show,

179
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:11.600
they do acknowledge they're still on his mind.

180
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.540
<v 4>It was a difficult 10 years. I'm not going to take you through all the agony.</v>

181
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.110
Yeah.

182
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.870
<v 0>The specials don't speak much to the Dave Chappelle narrative.</v>

183
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:21.020
That may be because he shot the specialist without any streaming deal.

184
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.050
And Netflix bought them later. I literally just took them out of the class.

185
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.930
Like they're both well-made and funny specials.

186
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.590
And they gave the world a re-introduction to Chappelle and primarily serve to

187
00:10:30.591 --> 00:10:33.590
show he's still got it. And by omitting the controversy of him,

188
00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:36.710
quitting Chappelle show and leaving show business for 10 years,

189
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.900
the specials also create dramatic tension.

190
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.180
Everybody still wants to know how all that affected him.

191
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.790
He resolves that tension in his next two specials,

192
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.620
equanimity and the bird revelation.

193
00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.400
These specials clearly seek to address the demons from his Chappelle show days.

194
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.640
One clue is their titles. The first is called equanimity,

195
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:55.670
which means an evenness of mind, especially under stress.

196
00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.600
His very first joke makes it clear that his comedy is now in his hands.

197
00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:04.040
<v 4>And after this, it's time to make America wait again.</v>

198
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:08.210
<v 0>The entire opening shows a comedian who understands his talent and knows how to</v>

199
00:11:08.211 --> 00:11:09.650
resist to the force of others.

200
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.950
<v 4>Black and show business and do too well. It's scary.</v>

201
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:17.600
Like you gotta get the out of the casino while the getting's good while you're

202
00:11:17.601 --> 00:11:18.434
still winning.

203
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.200
<v 0>If equanimity reflects a comedian in control,</v>

204
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:23.240
then the following special shows how he got there.

205
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:26.810
This next special feels much more intimate. And it's my personal favorite.

206
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:30.680
It's called the bird revelation. And that title actually has multiple meanings.

207
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:34.340
The first interpretation relates to the prostitution analogy at the end of the

208
00:11:34.341 --> 00:11:36.770
special, the word bird is slang for a girl.

209
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.610
And Dave knows that he even uses the word bird in this way during a sketch on

210
00:11:40.611 --> 00:11:41.444
Chappelle show.

211
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.200
<v 4>One of those that you just bring it home. Well,</v>

212
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.020
you bring it home and wear out.

213
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.290
<v 0>The bird revelation is Dave having the revelation that while at Chappelle show,</v>

214
00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.700
he was the bird getting worn out. This capital's manifested.

215
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.970
<v 1>And that's why I went to South Africa.</v>

216
00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.940
<v 0>Another interpretation of the title has to do with the quote.</v>

217
00:12:06.941 --> 00:12:08.950
At the beginning of the special I came alive,

218
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.280
I could fly this quote was supposedly said by Charlie Parker,

219
00:12:12.281 --> 00:12:16.000
after he realized a completely new way to play music, Charlie Parker,

220
00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.430
his nickname was bird. Hence the bird revelation.

221
00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:22.150
This second meeting also relates to Chappelle's career like Charlie Parker,

222
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.690
Chappelle realized he could do his art form in a completely new way.

223
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:29.020
After years of leaving comedy, he has come back completely differently.

224
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:33.280
Now he can make comedy without the executives who pushed him too far in short

225
00:12:33.281 --> 00:12:34.114
he's free.

226
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.640
<v 2>It was scary. Now I feel like it's liberate. Like I feel free.</v>

227
00:12:38.641 --> 00:12:41.790
Like I can just say what I want to do. I, when they already call me crazy.

228
00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.540
<v 0>The narrative of the life of Dave Chappelle is defined by one word, freedom.</v>

229
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.680
Chapelle is no longer bound by the will of executives and can now work on his

230
00:12:49.681 --> 00:12:50.460
own terms.

231
00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:53.340
And there's really no other comedian with the level of freedom that Dave

232
00:12:53.341 --> 00:12:54.300
Chappelle has. You know,

233
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:58.560
I've got the corporate relationships in the CEO hat in the

234
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.790
companies. So, you know, I can't do certain things.

235
00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.940
<v 4>And then Kevin said, it. I quit.</v>

236
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.240
And then he went on every talk show in America and apologize for six weeks.

237
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:14.910
<v 0>Envious and jealous of Dave's ability to go and be free as</v>

238
00:13:14.911 --> 00:13:18.540
a comic in the times where we desperately need to be.

239
00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.240
<v 2>I'm going to go to Africa. I'm going to find a way to,</v>

240
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.380
I'm going to find a way to be myself. I'm an artist, man. You know, I don't,

241
00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:26.243
I don't need a snake.

242
00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.370
<v 4>That's why we have a sneaker deal. Cause if you say something people don't like,</v>

243
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:30.600
they'll take your shoes.

244
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:33.150
<v 0>Chappelle truly does whatever he wants.</v>

245
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.360
Sometimes it feels like he breaks the rules just to remind us that he can.

246
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.370
<v 4>And also tell you that I skipped rehearsal during the civil rights movement.</v>

247
00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:43.380
Uh, I can't,

248
00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:48.540
I can't read what's on the teleprompter and I want everyone in America right now

249
00:13:48.541 --> 00:13:51.210
to look at me, look at me, smoking in doors.

250
00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.790
I didn't ask anybody. I just did it. What are they gonna do?

251
00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:00.600
Kick me out before I get the prize. Now, this is called leverage.

252
00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.590
<v 0>Everyone embraces Chappelle's ability to resist the poles of show business,</v>

253
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.920
especially in an era where show business has received a huge amount of

254
00:14:07.921 --> 00:14:09.360
completely warranted criticism.

255
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:12.270
But those aren't the only people Chappelle doesn't want controlling him.

256
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:16.710
<v 4>Cure. What I find out could be today, tomorrow 15, 20 years from now,</v>

257
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:20.100
if I find out you're through finished,

258
00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:24.600
that's you, that's what the audience sounds like to me.

259
00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:32.460
<v 0>The title of his latest special sticks and stones has a pretty clear meaning.</v>

260
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.630
Chappelle is reminding us that criticisms of him aren't going to hurt him or his

261
00:14:36.631 --> 00:14:39.030
comedy. And in classic Dave Chappelle fashion,

262
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:43.170
he references other black provocateurs to explain what he's doing. First.

263
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.630
<v 1>The opening quote, tell me something to. Can't tell me nothing. I read the</v>

264
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.520
[inaudible] and even more explicitly.

265
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.330
<v 0>He quilts Prince lyrics that essentially summarize his entire argument. Yeah.</v>

266
00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:57.250
<v 4>And this was the bar,</v>

267
00:14:57.251 --> 00:15:01.630
the whole song Prince say trying to run from my

268
00:15:01.631 --> 00:15:06.070
destruction. You know what I did? And even chaos.

269
00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:07.990
<v 0>As Marine Callahan noted,</v>

270
00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:11.980
he is telling us that he is willing to not just destroy, but be destroyed.

271
00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.110
If you consider Chappelle's career up to this point,

272
00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.740
his decision to continue telling destructive jokes about things he already got

273
00:15:17.741 --> 00:15:21.910
backlash for should come as no surprise Chapelle. Isn't just telling jokes.

274
00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.230
He's making a broader point.

275
00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.840
Just like when he actively resist the rules of show business.

276
00:15:25.841 --> 00:15:29.980
He also resists to bowing down to criticism to remind us that his comedy will

277
00:15:29.981 --> 00:15:31.900
always be his and his alone,

278
00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:36.040
whether it's TV executives or his audience Chappelle will fight back against any

279
00:15:36.041 --> 00:15:37.600
attempt to restrict what he says.

280
00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.900
Some people prefer Chappelle's older comedy over his recent work.

281
00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.350
And I totally get that his first two specials killing them softly.

282
00:15:50.351 --> 00:15:53.890
And for what it's worth are easily, two of the best comedy shows of all time.

283
00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:58.480
But I do enjoy how his more recent work incorporates the narrative of his life

284
00:15:58.510 --> 00:15:59.770
into his performances.

285
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:03.580
And sometimes he also adds his experience to the work of other performers.

286
00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:07.330
A perfect example is Chappelle's interruption of Kendrick Lamar's performance

287
00:16:07.331 --> 00:16:09.070
during the Grammys in 2018.

288
00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.560
<v 4>I'm Dave Chappelle.</v>

289
00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:20.290
And I just wanted to remind the audience that the only thing more frightening

290
00:16:20.291 --> 00:16:24.550
than watching a black man be honest in America is being an honest black man in

291
00:16:24.551 --> 00:16:28.480
America. Sorry for the interruption. Please continue.

292
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.600
<v 0>This theatrical interruption is full of meaning.</v>

293
00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.380
Speaking specifically to the nature of black artistry in the United States.

294
00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:39.250
The fact that Chappelle introduces himself feels almost funny since everybody

295
00:16:39.251 --> 00:16:40.660
clearly knows who he is,

296
00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:43.930
but that introduction emphasizes that these are not words coming from just

297
00:16:43.931 --> 00:16:47.890
anybody they're coming from Dave Chapelle, another honest black man in America,

298
00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:51.370
his presence becomes an authoritative comment on the obstacles and risks of a

299
00:16:51.371 --> 00:16:53.890
black man performing his art without holding back.

300
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:57.520
<v 4>It looks like you're singing the dancing. It was brothers taking a note.</v>

301
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.390
<v 0>And in the same way that Kendrick Lamar is not just singing and dancing.</v>

302
00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:05.860
Dave Chappelle is not just telling jokes in eight 46,

303
00:17:05.861 --> 00:17:09.400
Dave Chappelle heavily criticizes the conservative commentator, Candace Owens.

304
00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.600
<v 4>I can't think of a worse way to make money.</v>

305
00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:17.290
<v 0>And Owens responded that people need to be able to laugh at themselves.</v>

306
00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:20.590
So she's okay with Chappelle talking about her that way in the end,

307
00:17:20.591 --> 00:17:23.440
she probably would've made the criticism worse. If she fought back,

308
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:26.440
there's really no good way to respond to a comedian acting freely.

309
00:17:26.441 --> 00:17:29.590
And truthfully, because if you accept that comedians can say anything,

310
00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.380
then you have to accept that criticism when it's directed at you,

311
00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:35.500
even if it's brutal, but if you disagree with what a comedian says,

312
00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.080
then you can be criticized for taking them too seriously.

313
00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:40.870
And nobody plays both of these sides more than Dave Chappelle.

314
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.300
Sometimes he's just telling jokes. That don't mean anything.

315
00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.030
And sometimes he's telling hard truths. That mean a lot.

316
00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:48.700
And he's also doing everything in between his latest,

317
00:17:48.701 --> 00:17:52.770
special 46 and his performance at the Grammy's confirm that he's not just a

318
00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:55.200
comedian, but also not just a thought leader.

319
00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:57.300
He's both and full of contradictions.

320
00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.580
Like do people care what he has to say or not?

321
00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.210
<v 2>I know nobody gives a what I think anyway,</v>

322
00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.470
the reason people want to hear from people like me is because.

323
00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:09.290
<v 0>Trust me, is he telling it like it is? Or is he just messing around?</v>

324
00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.700
<v 2>I was right once. Remember that I didn't come here to be right. Give me the.</v>

325
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.820
<v 0>Is he a thought leader or is he just telling jokes?</v>

326
00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:21.740
<v 2>I pride myself on saying real people don't even</v>

327
00:18:21.741 --> 00:18:25.760
notice I'm saying. Uh, and, and then sometimes I just tell jokes.

328
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.260
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

329
00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.410
There's even something kind of strange about this video taking Dave Chappelle

330
00:18:30.411 --> 00:18:34.190
very seriously, despite the fact that some of his comedy is just plain silly.

331
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:35.083
There's just not enough.

332
00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.810
<v 2>Stove, top stuff for everybody.</v>

333
00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:40.370
So I kicked her in the.

334
00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:42.680
<v 0>Yeah. That is the beauty of Dave Chappelle.</v>

335
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:47.000
He lives in this limbo between jokes and sincerity and he can effortlessly move

336
00:18:47.001 --> 00:18:50.570
between them if he's really a legend than his work deserves to be treated like

337
00:18:50.571 --> 00:18:52.850
art. But if he's also a hilarious comedian,

338
00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.190
then his work doesn't need to be treated like art at all.

339
00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.300
You can just laugh at it.

340
00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:01.070
His comedy is simultaneously a joke and more than just a joke serious and

341
00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.770
non-serious offensive and not offensive.

342
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:09.960
<v 2>My favorite book of all time, narrative of the life of Frederick.</v>

343
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.210
<v 0>Dave Chappelle has an intimate connection with the great abolitionist Frederick</v>

344
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.660
Douglas.

345
00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:15.530
<v 2>To my knowledge,</v>

346
00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:19.100
it's the first black person that was officially invited to the white house was

347
00:19:19.101 --> 00:19:20.180
Frederick Douglas.

348
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.390
I talked about how few black people were invited to the Winehouse,

349
00:19:23.391 --> 00:19:27.350
how Frederick Douglas was the first and that it didn't happen again until

350
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:31.670
Roosevelt, but that was wrong. It happened one other time before that,

351
00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.630
that delegation was led by that AME Bishop

352
00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.840
William David Chappelle,

353
00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:43.100
where I get my name was my great-grandfather,

354
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.350
who was a slave when he was born.

355
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:48.920
<v 0>And not only does Chappelle's lineage have similarities with Douglas,</v>

356
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:52.220
but they also both create narratives out of their life stories.

357
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:55.700
The exact phrasing of the title of Douglas as memoir is crucial.

358
00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.040
It's not titled the life of Frederick Douglas,

359
00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.620
but rather the narrative of the life of Frederick Douglas.

360
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:04.670
His first memoir has a lot of thematic similarities with other slave narratives.

361
00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:08.270
The story functions, not just as a recounting of Frederick Douglass's life,

362
00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:12.380
but also a story that fits into the greater narrative of overcoming slavery in

363
00:20:12.381 --> 00:20:13.310
the American South.

364
00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:17.480
According to historian James only these narratives have three key elements,

365
00:20:17.481 --> 00:20:18.710
literacy identity,

366
00:20:18.711 --> 00:20:22.340
and freedom slaves learned to read and write in difficult situations,

367
00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:26.750
invent a new social identity for themselves and live their lives as Freeman and

368
00:20:26.751 --> 00:20:27.650
abolitionists.

369
00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:31.490
Only his most interesting claim is that these narrative elements actually occur

370
00:20:31.491 --> 00:20:35.750
past slavery and into African-American literature in the Jim Crow era with

371
00:20:35.751 --> 00:20:38.900
stories like black boy and the autobiography of Malcolm X,

372
00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.900
addressing similar ideas of learning to educate oneself,

373
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:45.320
reinventing one's own identity and advocating for freedom from oppression.

374
00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.970
Dave Chappelle embraces his relationship with Frederick Douglas and in many

375
00:20:48.971 --> 00:20:49.690
ways,

376
00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:52.990
Chappelle story has parallels with that traditional Afro American narrative.

377
00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.480
His literature is his artistry as a comic.

378
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:59.080
His identity is the independence he declared by going to Africa.

379
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.440
And his freedom is advocating to say what he wants on stage,

380
00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:05.950
where he knows who he is, right. And in that compromise.

381
00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:07.330
And no one can tell him.

382
00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:12.390
<v 4>Any different. I understand what I am. I really do more than anybody.</v>

383
00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:16.980
When is we going to be free? That is a good question, man. Man.

384
00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:19.640
How about now?

385
00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:27.150
<v 0>Dave Chappelle tells his story by recontextualizing it in the stories of other</v>

386
00:21:27.151 --> 00:21:30.390
African-American figures, whether it's through a pimp in the forties,

387
00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.360
Frederick Douglas visiting the white house or Kendrick Lamar,

388
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:37.800
he finds a commonality in these stories and that commonality elevates his story

389
00:21:37.801 --> 00:21:39.930
and his career to that of a legend,

390
00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:44.250
the vast majority of articles or videos about Dave Chappelle analyze his jokes.

391
00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:48.120
But I think that sells his career short. Obviously his comedy is amazing,

392
00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:52.200
but within his comedy specials, he also contextualizes his artistry.

393
00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:56.190
He celebrates other black intellectuals to elevate the meaning of his career

394
00:21:56.191 --> 00:21:59.640
choices and by doing so he becomes an intellectual in his own, right?

395
00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:03.210
They've Chappelle is an amazing comedian because he has some amazing jokes,

396
00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:06.150
but it's what he says between those jokes that makes him legendary.

397
00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:07.350
This is not fun.

398
00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:13.110
<v 4>I got some jokes too. I could do, but I just really just.</v>

399
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:17.550
<v 0>I released this video on October 27th,</v>

400
00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.910
which is officially Dave Chappelle day in the city of DC where I live.

401
00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:22.380
So how does he want us to celebrate.

402
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:27.660
<v 4>And the future on Dave Chappelle day, I ask everyone who wishes to celebrate it,</v>

403
00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:32.130
to make one incredible memory for themselves and or somebody else,

404
00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:36.000
or maybe do it a different way from now on, on October 27th,

405
00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:41.010
everybody and out of me at Duke Ellington school.

406
00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.130
<v 0>Dave Chappelle's comedy highlights, countless black artists,</v>

407
00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.580
and he also frequently highlights important historical events in the black

408
00:22:53.581 --> 00:22:55.350
community, like the crack epidemic,

409
00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.710
the civil rights movement and the HIV pandemic. In fact,

410
00:22:58.711 --> 00:23:02.820
one of Chappelle's first on-screen appearances was to rap about AIDS awareness,

411
00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.880
but it's men and women and the young ladies,

412
00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:09.450
if you want to be like young Dave Chappelle and support combating HIV,

413
00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.570
