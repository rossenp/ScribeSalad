00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.773
<v 1>You see it.</v>

4
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.580
Is it possible to too huge to what?

5
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.420
<v 0>There's no better test for a filmmaker than the courtroom scene.</v>

6
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.660
Think about everything going on in a courtroom scene while a lawyer interrogates

7
00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:20.960
a witness, the judge moderates, the examination, the other lawyer,

8
00:00:20.961 --> 00:00:23.870
potentially objects, and the witness answers the questions.

9
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.640
That's already a handful of people,

10
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.120
and that doesn't even include all the spectators, the accused, the jury,

11
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.870
and all the people watching there's so much going on that some films decide to

12
00:00:32.871 --> 00:00:35.990
just simplify the scene in the first trial scene in a few good men,

13
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.320
we get introduced to the jury and the victim's family in the audience.

14
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.011
But after that,

15
00:00:40.011 --> 00:00:43.220
those characters don't get any more screen time and stay in the background for

16
00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:44.120
the rest of the movie.

17
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.750
This choice makes sense for the film because it's based on a play and that play

18
00:00:47.751 --> 00:00:50.930
didn't even have a jury or spectators on stage in place.

19
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.490
The viewer watches from one angle.

20
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.950
So there isn't as much space as an actual courtroom,

21
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.900
but film doesn't have that limitation.

22
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.770
The camera can be anywhere at any time capturing moments from all the characters

23
00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:03.470
within a huge courtroom, the courtroom scenes in a few good men,

24
00:01:03.471 --> 00:01:06.650
focus on only a few characters and they're very well shot,

25
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.280
but I don't think they showed the full potential of a courtroom scene with so

26
00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:11.960
many different perspectives to play up.

27
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.870
A courtroom can raise the stakes for many characters at once,

28
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.770
which can create some of the most complicated and satisfying scenes in cinema.

29
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.890
Many films managed to pull off this narrative complexity,

30
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.310
giving each character their own moments while still maintaining spatial and

31
00:01:25.311 --> 00:01:28.940
editorial clarity. So how do they do it? The answer, it depends on the film,

32
00:01:28.941 --> 00:01:30.740
but one thing is always clear. Oh, well,

33
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.460
shot courtroom scene requires a mastery of several cinematic techniques.

34
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.930
So let's take this video to court.

35
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.260
<v 1>All rise.</v>

36
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.110
<v 0>This space of the courtroom itself presents a challenge for the filmmaker.</v>

37
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.080
A typical scene with dialogue will follow the one 80 rule.

38
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.500
This role means that the camera stays on one side of two characters to keep the

39
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.000
shots spatially consistent.

40
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.810
Some films purposefully break this rule to create disorientation like in the

41
00:01:56.811 --> 00:01:58.190
bathroom scene in the shining.

42
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.300
The camera crosses that imaginary line and the angle change makes the scene feel

43
00:02:02.301 --> 00:02:05.930
more uneasy and dreamlike, but in a scene with more characters breaking,

44
00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:07.820
the one 80 rule can confuse the audience.

45
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.490
<v 1>Did you and Mr. Kimball traveled to Washington DC.</v>

46
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.360
<v 0>This scene repeatedly breaks the rule in confusing ways,</v>

47
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.420
moving around the court without giving any sense of the space.

48
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.090
The jury and spectators might as well be in different rooms.

49
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.330
But the problem is that a large scene like this one has to break the rule

50
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.900
because it's impossible to show the entire 360 degree space.

51
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.280
If you're stuck on one side.

52
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.070
So how do you break the rule without confusing the audience?

53
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.380
Let's say you want to introduce a new character in a spot.

54
00:02:33.381 --> 00:02:34.640
The audience hasn't seen yet.

55
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.090
How do you do it first to use blocking in this scene in a bug's life?

56
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.750
Hopper crosses the imaginary line by moving from the right of the frame to the

57
00:02:41.751 --> 00:02:43.160
left, by changing sides.

58
00:02:43.161 --> 00:02:46.580
He comfortably moves the imaginary line to a new position that will later

59
00:02:46.581 --> 00:02:47.900
include the new character.

60
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.860
Plus it has the added effect of making hopper appear in control of the scene.

61
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.430
His movement literally controls the camera. You can also use framing.

62
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.760
We don't know it yet, but the new character shows up in the cave entrance.

63
00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:00.760
That's on the right side of the shot,

64
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.640
placing hopper on the left side of the frame, bounces the camera,

65
00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:04.480
move to the right.

66
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.500
Finally cement this new position by having the entire colony look from left to

67
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:09.334
right,

68
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.600
This blocking sets up the payoff while also further reinforcing the new

69
00:03:15.601 --> 00:03:16.560
imaginary line.

70
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.830
One of the layout artists for the film said this was a challenging scene to pull

71
00:03:19.831 --> 00:03:23.130
off because moving the line required, careful choreography and framing.

72
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.950
And when it works, we don't even notice it. This isn't a courtroom scene,

73
00:03:25.951 --> 00:03:27.690
but it functions exactly like one.

74
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.510
There's a crowd of spectators main action in the center.

75
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.310
And it even has a surprise witness.

76
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.520
What I'm trying to say is that all courtroom scenes have the same challenge as

77
00:03:35.521 --> 00:03:37.080
this one-off scene in a bug's life.

78
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.620
The massive space of a courtroom packed with all its different characters means

79
00:03:40.621 --> 00:03:44.490
that any coherent courtroom scene requires the same laser precision from this

80
00:03:44.491 --> 00:03:48.930
particularly complicated scene to kill a Mockingbird uses the same one 80 rule

81
00:03:48.931 --> 00:03:52.230
transitioning as a bug's life. At first, the camera's on one side,

82
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.530
but Atticus crosses the line to move the camera to the opposite side.

83
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.630
His blocking prepares us for the camera change.

84
00:03:57.631 --> 00:03:59.640
So it feels natural and like hopper,

85
00:03:59.641 --> 00:04:03.840
it has the same subconscious effect of showing Atticus's command of the scene.

86
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.840
The editing also prepares the viewer for new angles of the courtroom.

87
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.950
The camera starts close between Atticus and Majella, but once she accuses Tom,

88
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.460
the camera moves to him entering the back and forth and moving the imaginary

89
00:04:14.461 --> 00:04:15.090
line. Again,

90
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.840
this small change allows the camera to include Tom in the scene and to naturally

91
00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:22.650
transition to a new back and forth between Tom and to Atticus. In many ways,

92
00:04:22.651 --> 00:04:25.920
a courtroom scene is a collection of smaller scenes and the right editing and

93
00:04:25.921 --> 00:04:28.590
blocking can transition from one mini scene to another,

94
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.900
every time a main character talks to a new character.

95
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.630
The filmmaker needs to set up a new spatial relationship.

96
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.960
Like when a lawyer goes from questioning a witness to talking to a judge.

97
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.540
And one way to make this change is by moving the camera.

98
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.670
<v 2>Oh, what was that word? Uh, what word to what,</v>

99
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.050
what.

100
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.750
<v 0>These individual techniques may seem simple on their own,</v>

101
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.050
but when combined the audience gets a full understanding of the courtroom,

102
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.290
while only being able to see a small portion of it at any given time,

103
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.690
along with planning out the proper angles for the camera,

104
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.990
a filmmaker also has to plan what the shots will actually look like.

105
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.010
Some of the most iconic courtroom moments in film do come from closeups that

106
00:05:05.011 --> 00:05:06.480
show an intense performance.

107
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.020
But I think the most interesting shots are the ones that take advantage of the

108
00:05:10.021 --> 00:05:13.200
full space of the courtroom. When Atticus questions may Ella,

109
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.510
the backgrounds mostly shows the white audience,

110
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.080
but when he continues with Tom the shots add the black audience on the second

111
00:05:19.081 --> 00:05:23.310
floor into the frame because the geography of a courtroom is so well understood.

112
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.910
There's plenty of opportunity to frame other characters in the shot to create a

113
00:05:26.911 --> 00:05:28.110
more dynamic image.

114
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.820
<v 2>Oh, excuse me on to you.</v>

115
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.270
<v 3>And you're watching the lawyers, but if you actually think to look or,</v>

116
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.930
or do look, there's almost this out of focus expression in the background,

117
00:05:39.931 --> 00:05:44.430
which I think in a way is more effective and more moving because it does make

118
00:05:44.431 --> 00:05:48.900
you project a lot onto them of what you think they must be feeling or thinking.

119
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.050
<v 0>A few good men does have similar frame composition,</v>

120
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.580
but because the drama mainly focuses on the emotions of just two people at once

121
00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.440
the framing have the same emotional projection that happens in other courtroom

122
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:01.010
scenes,

123
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.910
the focus on two characters emphasizes the drama of the main interaction,

124
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.700
but it comes at the expense of not always creating a strong,

125
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.280
spatial and emotional understanding of the courtroom,

126
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.790
which means not always spending the time setting up transitions or moving the

127
00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:15.800
camera to change. Focus in that film.

128
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:17.780
The camera focuses on keeping the story moving,

129
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.230
not necessarily to capture the emotions of all the characters in the courtroom,

130
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.610
but for many courtroom movies,

131
00:06:22.611 --> 00:06:25.370
it's crucial to get that full experience right from the beginning,

132
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.610
which is why one of the most effective tools for the courtroom is the crane

133
00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:31.160
shot. Crane shots are perfect for a courtroom scene,

134
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.490
many scenes start with a wide shot and then use the crane to move into the

135
00:06:34.491 --> 00:06:35.000
action.

136
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.570
By transitioning from an establishing shot to a medium shot in a single take,

137
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.680
the audience gets a very clear understanding of the space and no courtroom drama

138
00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:46.100
takes the crane shot further than the show that people versus OJ Simpson,

139
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.270
American crime story,

140
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.200
the cinematic style of this show directly contrast how people actually watch the

141
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:52.610
OJ trial in real life.

142
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.270
The live TV broadcast came from only one camera mounted in the corner of the

143
00:06:56.271 --> 00:06:56.750
courtroom,

144
00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.830
the TV drama [inaudible] instead uses the crane shot extensively to give the

145
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:03.560
viewer an up close experience of the entire trial.

146
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.830
The crane accomplishes the same thing that blocking and editing do for other

147
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:07.610
courtroom scenes.

148
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.880
It allows the camera to move between several different perspectives within a

149
00:07:10.881 --> 00:07:12.650
large courtroom, but instead of a cut,

150
00:07:12.651 --> 00:07:14.840
it bridges those perspectives by moving the camera,

151
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.480
the crane gives these scenes so much energy in depth.

152
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.970
It has the ability to show the full extent of the courtroom.

153
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.800
And during the show's most intense moments,

154
00:07:21.801 --> 00:07:24.740
the crane follows suit by moving more quickly between characters,

155
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.550
the crane acts as an all-seeing eye that can tap into any part of the court.

156
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.960
And because it's a mini series,

157
00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:33.140
the show has more time to devote to each aspect of the courtroom.

158
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.640
Plenty of time goes to the jury,

159
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.820
the judge and audience members like the Goldmans and the reporters,

160
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.760
but even then capturing all those characters is still a challenge.

161
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:44.540
The show had to out a split screen to cover all the reactions to the verdict

162
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.530
while the filmmaking style starkly contrast with the actual visuals from the TV

163
00:07:48.531 --> 00:07:49.250
broadcast,

164
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.640
it better conveys the average American's experience with the OJ trial.

165
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.350
It dominated the news for months,

166
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.870
and most people felt like the crane camera in this scene,

167
00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.110
they peered into every detail of all the characters lives and relations.

168
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.040
<v 4>Chips. The people.</v>

169
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.370
<v 0>Versus OJ didn't need to dramatize this pivotal cultural moment.</v>

170
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.190
It only needed to show the drama that already existed.

171
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:11.800
The filmmaking in the people versus OJ shows the height.

172
00:08:11.801 --> 00:08:15.760
A courtroom scene can reach the criminal justice system already conveys so much

173
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:16.540
human drama.

174
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.990
So turning them into compelling cinema is only a matter of packaging,

175
00:08:19.991 --> 00:08:23.740
the individual moments and making them legible to a viewer. It's a challenge,

176
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:24.580
but when it pays off,

177
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:28.150
it pays off big courtroom scenes are some of the most popular scenes in movies

178
00:08:28.151 --> 00:08:28.810
and TV.

179
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:31.690
There are thousands of completely different scenes I could have looked at,

180
00:08:31.691 --> 00:08:33.970
but I do know they all have one thing in common.

181
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.710
Each has to address the same problem.

182
00:08:35.711 --> 00:08:39.130
How do you film such a large space with so many different characters in it?

183
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.140
The solution will vary from scene to scene,

184
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:44.650
but whether it's solved through blocking framing or ambitious camera work,

185
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.230
if they pull it off, it'll always be impressive.

186
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.120
So the next time you sit down to watch a movie,

187
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.330
try picking something with a courtroom scene or even a large ensemble scene,

188
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.970
just to see how they captured all the characters in the room,

189
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.400
but with so many films to choose from,

190
00:08:56.401 --> 00:08:58.950
it's sometimes overwhelming to decide what to watch.

191
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.100
So if you ever find yourself struggling with what to pick, try movie,

192
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.490
