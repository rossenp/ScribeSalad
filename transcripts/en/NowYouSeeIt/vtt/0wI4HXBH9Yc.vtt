00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.200
<v 0>The cinema of the seventies really started in</v>

2
00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:07.830
1967 with the release of Bonnie and Clyde.

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.630
We wrapped banks.

4
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:14.630
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

5
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.170
<v 2>One could argue that we can separate Hollywood into two eras the era before</v>

6
00:00:18.171 --> 00:00:20.630
Bonnie and Clyde, and to be era after Bonnie and Clyde,

7
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.140
Bonnie and Clyde is one of the most revolutionary and groundbreaking movies ever

8
00:00:24.141 --> 00:00:25.730
made it introduced film language,

9
00:00:25.731 --> 00:00:29.270
never before seen in American cinema and push the boundaries for what Hollywood

10
00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:30.104
was capable of.

11
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.040
The film tells the story of Bonnie and Clyde two Outlaws robbing banks during

12
00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:36.320
the great depression through its daring style,

13
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.310
its French inspired script and its commentary on both the past and the present

14
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.580
Bonnie and Clyde laid the groundwork for the future and carved out a space in

15
00:00:43.581 --> 00:00:47.630
Hollywood for the experimental and genre bending films of the 1970s.

16
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.990
So let's analyze the opening scene to understand the film staring into

17
00:00:50.991 --> 00:00:51.920
innovative style.

18
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.990
The film opens with an extreme closeup on a pair of luscious lips already

19
00:00:56.991 --> 00:01:00.470
suggesting that sexuality will play an important role in the film throughout the

20
00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:02.390
scene. The camera tracks Bonnie closely.

21
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.580
It's a very empathizing way to film the character.

22
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.420
The cuts continue following her movement, but they skip over time in this frame.

23
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:11.120
Bonnie just starts to stand up, but in the very next frame,

24
00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:14.810
she's already standing. This happens throughout the scene, maintaining movement,

25
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.850
but skipping over time,

26
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.130
The movement is maintained. The cuts feel natural,

27
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.950
but the viewer still senses the unease below the surface,

28
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.910
extreme tracking closeups combined with spatial and temporal disruption convey

29
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.650
the tension felt within the character.

30
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.370
The camera also reinforces this tension visually by boxing the character into

31
00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:36.320
frames within the frame in one shot,

32
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.060
she's stuck inside the bed frame and to another inside the window frame in this

33
00:01:41.061 --> 00:01:45.200
shot, we get visual cues of her juvenile state from the doll and trinkets in the

34
00:01:45.201 --> 00:01:45.920
background.

35
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.740
And it's not a coincidence that she's standing in front of a bird cage.

36
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.220
All these choices seem pretty bold, but the editing is so seamless.

37
00:01:52.221 --> 00:01:55.730
The camera work is so precise and the use of space is so practical that the

38
00:01:55.731 --> 00:01:58.070
sequence doesn't feel over the top or confusing.

39
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.610
It perfectly conveys that Bonnie feels trapped and uneasy with her life.

40
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.120
The editing choices in the opening scene feels self-explanatory for a modern

41
00:02:05.121 --> 00:02:05.540
viewer,

42
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.960
but this style of editing was actually quite unusual for a Hollywood film at

43
00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:09.560
that time.

44
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.250
So it's no surprise that director Arthur Penn didn't get his editing inspiration

45
00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:14.000
from America.

46
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.780
Instead he borrowed it from a group of innovative filmmakers across the Atlantic.

47
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.910
<v 1>Part of what makes.</v>

48
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.500
<v 2>Bonnie and Clyde such a pivotal film.</v>

49
00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:25.160
Was it skillful repackaging of the innovations of the French new wave for an

50
00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:27.650
American audience? The new wave was a film movement,

51
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.480
all about breaking genre conventions.

52
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.140
These films introduced experimental techniques, never used in mainstream cinema,

53
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.530
such as discontinuous editing and imaginative, unusual narratives, journalists,

54
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.211
Steven Newman,

55
00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:41.900
and Robert Benson admired these filmmakers and wanted to bring their innovations

56
00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:42.710
to America.

57
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.010
So they wrote a screenplay that took the iconic American gangster story of

58
00:02:46.011 --> 00:02:49.460
Bonnie and Clyde and injected it with the provocative style of the French new

59
00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:52.160
wave, their initial script borrows heavily from Gianluca,

60
00:02:52.161 --> 00:02:54.530
Doris breathless and Francois Truffaut's Jules.

61
00:02:54.531 --> 00:02:58.550
And Jim breathless is also about a couple on the run and ends with a climactic

62
00:02:58.551 --> 00:02:59.020
shootout.

63
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.440
It has the same editing techniques from Bonnie and Clyde preserving movement,

64
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:05.110
but distorting space and time Jules and Jim,

65
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.910
a similar influence on Bonnie and Clyde,

66
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.960
the film centers on an unconventional romance between two men and a whimsical

67
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:13.780
woman, something in an early draft of Bonnie and Clyde, Newman,

68
00:03:13.781 --> 00:03:17.230
and Benson also infused their script with the relentless pace and dramatic tonal

69
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:19.120
shifts. They admired in Jules and Jim,

70
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.300
the initial script of Bonnie and Clyde captured what made the wave so exciting

71
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:26.020
and remains in the final film and truthful also influenced the film directly

72
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.990
Benson and Newman center foe and early draft of the screenplay.

73
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.750
And he made many suggestions that made it into the final film.

74
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.110
It must've been obvious to Truffaut that the script had more than enough French

75
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.260
influence to become an exciting and revolutionary gangster film.

76
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.160
So he focused on making sure the film would not be so unfamiliar to an American

77
00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:44.710
audience, that it wouldn't make sense to them. Ironically,

78
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:47.890
his input streamlined the scripts that fit Hollywood norms and removed

79
00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:51.370
unnecessary scenes that were meant to reflect the meandering narratives of the

80
00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:55.240
French new wave. As film critic, Matthew Bernstein puts it Truffaut focused,

81
00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:58.390
not on opening the film up to more playful, disparate elements,

82
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.270
but on unifying it to give it greater aesthetic coherence.

83
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.850
The opening scene is a perfect example of this idea.

84
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.510
Chapo added this opening scene because the script originally opened with Clyde

85
00:04:07.511 --> 00:04:11.050
following Bonnie on the street. And he felt that made their meeting to abrupt.

86
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.440
Truffaut's addition gives us a stronger understanding of Bonnie's personal

87
00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:17.350
conflict that drives the story forward. But at the same time,

88
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:20.800
Arthur Penn shot and edited the opening scene still using French techniques.

89
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.600
So we ended up with the best of both worlds,

90
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.080
a cohesive story that also has the imaginative French influence.

91
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.230
So by the time filming started, Penn had the difficult task of shooting,

92
00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:33.160
a French inspired script while also making an American audience feel at home pen

93
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:37.150
added familiar American imagery through the film scenery like the FDR posters

94
00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:40.000
and the Oakey truck of the family who lost their house to the bank.

95
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.450
The mother and child in this scene echo the famous migrant mother photograph

96
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.080
Truffaut and Arthur Penn's contributions made the film suitable for an American

97
00:04:47.081 --> 00:04:50.710
audience while the French new wave influence gave it a brand new style.

98
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.220
The result is a groundbreaking film that pushed stylistic and narrative

99
00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:57.040
boundaries while still resonating with an American audience.

100
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.000
The film's compromise between French influence and Americana resulted in a film

101
00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:04.540
that went places. No studio backed film had ever gone in America.

102
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.890
The rest of the opening scene shows just how far this film went,

103
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.830
challenging Hollywood norms of gender, sex and violence.

104
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.560
When Bonnie catches Clyde trying to steal her mother's car,

105
00:05:14.561 --> 00:05:16.330
she speaks the first line in the movie.

106
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.070
<v 1>Hi Bowie. What you doing with my mama's car?</v>

107
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.830
<v 2>The screenwriters pick their words carefully throughout the film.</v>

108
00:05:22.831 --> 00:05:24.630
And the opening scene is no exception.

109
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.770
Addressing him as boy implies his youth and immaturity. In a later scene,

110
00:05:28.771 --> 00:05:30.150
we find out he's impotent,

111
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.410
his immaturity manifest itself sexually right after he first fails to perform.

112
00:05:34.411 --> 00:05:35.790
She repeats her initial name.

113
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.850
<v 1>Ooh, are you bored?</v>

114
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.600
<v 2>She may label him as boyish, but that doesn't keep her from admiring his law.</v>

115
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.850
Breaking a simple shot. Reverse shot tells the whole,

116
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.570
As the script puts it before they speak,

117
00:05:51.571 --> 00:05:55.410
they have become co-conspirators Bonnie speaking to Clyde from her window evokes

118
00:05:55.411 --> 00:05:59.240
the classic Romeo and Juliet scene. But in this version of the story,

119
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:02.180
she's completely naked and he's about to steal her mom's car.

120
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.230
They follow a similar star crossed lovers, storyline as Romeo and Juliet,

121
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.390
but they substitute innocent love for love,

122
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:11.240
fueled by violence and criminality throughout the film,

123
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.630
lawbreaking and violence substitute for sex, Bonnie seductively,

124
00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:15.680
strokes clients' gun.

125
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.390
And after Clyde fails at having sex again,

126
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:22.820
she cuddles with the gun Bonnie and Clyde challenges,

127
00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:24.470
conventional American storytelling,

128
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.950
and in the same way that the opening scene gives us a new unusual twist to the

129
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:31.700
classic Romeo and Juliet young lovers. The movie as a whole introduced,

130
00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:36.230
drastic tonal shifting that was brand new for Hollywood. The film challenges,

131
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:37.730
expectations in a lot of ways,

132
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.330
including its portrayal of the great depression and its portrayal of violence.

133
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.520
<v 3>Give me the money. What money Mr. There ain't no money here.</v>

134
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.460
<v 2>I think cloud was one of the first movies to portray the great depression as</v>

135
00:06:48.461 --> 00:06:49.540
kind of funny, right?

136
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.400
<v 3>It was a bang, but we failed three weeks ago.</v>

137
00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.770
<v 2>Their getaway chases seem ridiculous in their tiny 1930s automobiles.</v>

138
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.420
And they run into humorous mishaps,

139
00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.660
like not speaking loud enough to get anyone's attention during their robbery.

140
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.363
<v 3>Pickup.</v>

141
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.870
<v 2>1967 Feels like the year where just enough time passed after the great</v>

142
00:07:10.871 --> 00:07:12.070
depression to poke fun at it.

143
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.250
Thanks to Bonnie and Clyde filmmakers continue to have fun with this simple

144
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.820
dimwitted depression era South in movies like O brother where art thou,

145
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.500
but the film doesn't stick to comedy.

146
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:24.640
It creates a nervous imbalance between slapstick humor and violent tragedy.

147
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:25.540
During one robbery,

148
00:07:25.541 --> 00:07:29.260
the gang can't find their getaway car because their driver parked and the mishap

149
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.540
has played for laughs. But because of this mistake,

150
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.610
Clyde has to kill somebody trying to stop them.

151
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.720
The script describes the scene as funny and horrible at the same time in Pauline

152
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.771
kills review of the film.

153
00:07:38.771 --> 00:07:42.160
She notes that Bonnie and Clyde was the first film to artfully put the audience

154
00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:44.710
on the spot for the first time we are the butt of the joke.

155
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.250
We think we're clever for getting the joke right until we catch the first bullet

156
00:07:48.251 --> 00:07:52.240
right in the face to make the juxtaposition between comedy and violence work.

157
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.220
The film had to push the boundaries for both.

158
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:57.040
Not only was it the first movie to make the great depression funny,

159
00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.890
it was also the first to make violence, brutally realistic.

160
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:01.570
It introduced the use of squibs,

161
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:05.290
a small explosive device placed on an actor that made it look like they got hit

162
00:08:05.291 --> 00:08:07.600
by a bullet. When characters get shot in the film,

163
00:08:07.601 --> 00:08:10.600
we feel the impact and we see the injuries take a toll on them.

164
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.920
This brand new realism enhance the comedy as much as it enhanced the violence in

165
00:08:14.921 --> 00:08:18.130
one shootout, the realistic and brutal violence makes it gang members,

166
00:08:18.131 --> 00:08:19.540
frantic screaming that much more.

167
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:20.493
<v 3>Hilarious.</v>

168
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.540
<v 2>Before Bonnie and Clyde movies always told their story straight,</v>

169
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:29.140
dark comedies like Dr. Strange love had been coming out for years before Bonnie

170
00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:29.650
and Clyde,

171
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.920
but their satirical tone remained consistent from beginning to end the

172
00:08:32.921 --> 00:08:36.280
juxtapositioning and Bonnie and Clyde opened to the door for filmmakers to play

173
00:08:36.281 --> 00:08:40.270
with audience expectations towards tone and violence. By 1969,

174
00:08:40.271 --> 00:08:41.890
we were already seeing the effects,

175
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.820
the extreme violence in the wild bunch and the intense irony of Butch Cassidy

176
00:08:45.821 --> 00:08:49.300
and the Sundance kid owe a lot to Bonnie and Clyde. And by the seventies,

177
00:08:49.301 --> 00:08:51.040
it was in full swing Francis Coppola,

178
00:08:51.041 --> 00:08:54.850
himself copied the brutal realism in Bonnie and Clyde for the godfather by also

179
00:08:54.851 --> 00:08:59.070
using scripts and making the violence feel raw and intense and any modern movie

180
00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:02.340
that plays with emotional expectations owes itself to the revolutionary

181
00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:03.780
screenplay of Bonnie and Clyde.

182
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.203
<v 4>Out.</v>

183
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.880
<v 2>When Marvin gets shot in the face simple fiction,</v>

184
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:11.160
it feels just like the banker getting shot in the face.

185
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.200
Funny and horrible at the same time.

186
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.370
And the juxtaposition of Midwestern niceties and gruesome murder in Fargo feels

187
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:20.580
just like a gang member, flailing helplessly in the middle of a shootout.

188
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:24.350
<v 4>So what's the deal. Now Carrie says triple homicide. Yeah, it looks pretty bad.</v>

189
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.130
<v 2>So the next time you watch a contemporary American film with drastic shifts in</v>

190
00:09:28.131 --> 00:09:31.160
tone, bold editing or audience challenging storylines,

191
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:32.660
don't forget which couples started.

192
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.850
<v 4>At all. Thanks.</v>

193
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.480
<v 2>While Bonnie and Clyde did poke fun at depression era, rural America,</v>

194
00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.420
it also highlights the desperation. People felt during that time.

195
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.460
It's partially why Bonnie is willing to join,

196
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:46.760
but she has few other economic prospects as a waitress.

197
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:49.430
And if you want to learn more about this tumultuous time in history,

198
00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.910
I'd recommend watching the two-part documentary in 1929.

199
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.210
It's a riveting history of the stock market crash and the great depression.

200
00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.910
And it's only available on curiosity street, curiosity,

201

bunch of other creators, you know, and love there.

211
00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:34.070
It's a series analyzing TV title sequences with episodes by Patrick H. Williams,

212
00:10:34.071 --> 00:10:35.570
just right, and yours truly.

213
