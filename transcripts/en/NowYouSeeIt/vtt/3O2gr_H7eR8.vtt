1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.860
<v 0>We're here tonight to celebrate the career of a brilliant young man comedian</v>

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.990
actor, artist magician,

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.990
and some would say a smooth print out player from the streets that knows how to

4
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:16.950
get his. Please welcome. I want you to check this.

5
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:19.130
God is he's very funny. If he's from Washington,

6
00:00:19.131 --> 00:00:22.070
DC and the Grammy goes to bring to you now.

7
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.730
<v 1>Dave Chappelle written by Dave.</v>

8
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.253
I haven't seen.

9
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.860
<v 0>Have a seat, man. That's all relaxed. Thanks for coming back.</v>

10
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.000
Since you guys have been so good to me tonight, I feel like I owe, you know,

11
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:47.720
this, this next piece is about the real Dave Chappelle's personal.

12
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.360
It's actually very personal, but here it is,

13
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.520
that was around midnight. I was playing that's a Thelonious monk song.

14
00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.650
One of my favorite musicians, because his timing was so ill.

15
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.360
Every comedian is a stickler for timing and the loneliest monk was off

16
00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:08.840
time. Yet, perfectly on time, you should study it.

17
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.540
You're an aspiring comedian or aspiring musician. He's just.

18
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.373
<v 1>Right.</v>

19
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.610
<v 0>I was going through a real tough time, man, like just readjusting.</v>

20
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.200
And uh,

21
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.060
my mom bought me this time magazine with bill Cosby on the cover because

22
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.880
the ink, me and the guy had a lot of stuff in common.

23
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.020
Like some of the quotes he would say. And I just remember, like,

24
00:01:36.021 --> 00:01:39.500
after reading this stuff, I put it down and it was like,

25
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.520
I'm a be a comedic every time there's a blur celebrity in trouble.

26
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.880
Nails of the belief that I never think he's guilty.

27
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.840
And the reason he thinks that is because I never think they're guilty.

28
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.070
It's just how I roll man. At first, I didn't believe. And I was like, man,

29
00:01:55.071 --> 00:01:59.390
these people are obviously trying to destroy Dr. Cosby's rich legacy.

30
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.350
<v 2>When, uh, Cosby got sentenced Chappelle and rod call me back to back.</v>

31
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.370
Like both of them legitimately sad.

32
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.570
I felt bad.

33
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.230
<v 0>For them. I was explaining some of my younger family members,</v>

34
00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:17.180
you know who I like who he was at one point juxtapose to

35
00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:19.490
what's happening now. So it's astounding.

36
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.680
Obviously bill constantly was a hero to me and she doesn't know what it feels

37
00:02:24.681 --> 00:02:29.540
like to think that your hero might've done something so heinous, all my heroes,

38
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.770
either murdered by the government registered sections.

39
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.060
<v 1>My wife would probably be like.</v>

40
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.630
<v 0>Oh my God, Dave, look, there's George.</v>

41
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.650
Washington's the father of this great nation. I'm going to go shake his hand.

42
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:43.970
I'd be on the other side. Like.

43
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.710
<v 1>Ron, George Washington.</v>

44
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.370
<v 0>It's tough to see your heroes fall,</v>

45
00:02:49.371 --> 00:02:54.320
let alone be a villain because he wrote the declaration of

46
00:02:54.321 --> 00:02:59.170
independence and all that. We hold these truths to be self-evident Oh,

47
00:02:59.171 --> 00:03:00.004
man.

48
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.300
<v 1>Are created equal.</v>

49
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.570
<v 0>Go get me a sandwich. I'll kill you. Justice for him.</v>

50
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.520
<v 1>This is my impression of the founding fathers of America.</v>

51
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.410
<v 0>When the constitution was being written, hurry up,</v>

52
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.570
you finished that constitution. I'm trying to get some sleep.

53
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.960
<v 1>White people. Does it take the screw on the line? I don't know.</v>

54
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.940
Cause they'll get them negative dude for him.

55
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.560
And now you know how comedy is, right?

56
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.130
You always talk about whatever is close to your mind. It's like the trick lady,

57
00:03:41.131 --> 00:03:45.090
man joke is just something that's painful to me that you just try to make fun of

58
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.070
drugs. And alcohol have ruined my life.

59
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.230
<v 0>We started talking about bratty shows.</v>

60
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.900
We want to do something that was real personal. It was just, I don't know.

61
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.220
It just, the word personal kept coming up.

62
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.330
<v 1>I started doing drugs when I was little, just like you.</v>

63
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.230
<v 0>I grew up in the crack epidemic. I tell jokes about it. I lived in the eighties.</v>

64
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.720
It was, it was not like this in the eighties.

65
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.760
It was like a crack bomb had gone off like,

66
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.520
like DC during the crack epidemic was probably one of the worst cities in

67
00:04:17.521 --> 00:04:20.850
America. Everybody I knew so cracks. I only,

68
00:04:20.851 --> 00:04:23.850
God knows how many people were smoking crack.

69
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.350
That made a real big impression on crack head trying to break into somebody's

70
00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:30.600
car, man. And it struck a chord with me. I tried.

71
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.740
<v 1>Stop. I said, Hey. And he looked back and saw me and said, keep an eye out.</v>

72
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.600
I'm trying to help you. I want the to stop.

73
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.240
<v 0>And now there's opioid epidemic. Are they treating the opioid epidemic?</v>

74
00:04:45.241 --> 00:04:48.180
The way that they treated the crack epidemic? No,

75
00:04:48.181 --> 00:04:50.190
this is a national health emergency.

76
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.520
When we were coming up with police by the national guard,

77
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.070
addicts were criminals. It was like a little suspicious.

78
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.023
There's a little suspicious.

79
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.740
Every dead black person and police fan has crack sprinkled on them.

80
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.890
These white folks look exactly like us during the crack epidemic.

81
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.900
So now that your community is getting destroyed is the whole nother ball game.

82
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.570
It's a huge window of empathy, Tyrone.

83
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.060
<v 1>You know, I love you, but I feel like drugs is hurting you and it hurt me.</v>

84
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.560
Y'all wanna party with us.

85
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.950
<v 0>There we go. Here comes to deep water. This is.</v>

86
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.970
I shouldn't even say it's not politically correct to say these things.

87
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.510
I'm going to say something that I'm not allowed to say. I know it sounds up.

88
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.080
I'm not supposed to say that. I'm going to get canceled for

89
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.930
think people paying money,

90
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.090
to see a guy speak precisely and carefully.

91
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.630
Most likely you have a responsibility to speak records.

92
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.520
He's a comedian who's kind of to jab.

93
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.590
<v 3>The lion, you know, who is trying to.</v>

94
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.800
<v 0>Test the waters way back on the second episode, I did this piece about the, uh,</v>

95
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.630
a crack addict coming to a, a drug awareness week at a school.

96
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.190
I got a lot of complaints about it. I got a lot of letters about it.

97
00:06:14.191 --> 00:06:15.640
A lot of people said I was insensitive.

98
00:06:15.641 --> 00:06:19.720
So I brought them back again to the show. If you say to a comedian,

99
00:06:19.721 --> 00:06:22.120
you can't do this. I guarantee you,

100
00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.200
they will immediately do it tonight. Musical guests,

101
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.810
two in Chicago's finest, Sam, see, give it up for comment. And Kanye West,

102
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.100
I walked in the crib, got two kids and my baby mama

103
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.290
[inaudible] musicians were like this.

104
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.290
Every comic wants to be a musician.

105
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.530
Every musician thinks they're funny.

106
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.620
It's a very strange relationship in your head.

107
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.510
All these people who we all have in common,

108
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.040
I think we all have personal message that they try to get across. First of all,

109
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.440
Kanye is the artist and he's a genius. I've known Dan for a long time.

110
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.900
He's a genius. He's a real comedy genius. Yes.

111
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.820
I think that the angle he's seeing things from is about the vision that he sees

112
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.630
and all this they talk about on the news about how divided the nation is.

113
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:18.700
I love them. I support them. And if you at home watching this on Netflix,

114
00:07:18.701 --> 00:07:21.040
remember, you clicked on my face.

115
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.830
I don't have to agree with everything that he says. I just,

116
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.240
I just trust him as a person of intent. But, uh, yeah,

117
00:07:28.241 --> 00:07:33.130
he shouldn't say all that, but I, for one find solace in the arts.

118
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.320
I don't have to agree with all the arc and Sue,

119
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.440
but it helps me understand how I actually feel about it.

120
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.090
<v 3>19, the champion is the youngest comedian to ever appear on star search.</v>

121
00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.110
He's from Washington DC. Here's Dave Chapelle.

122
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.100
[inaudible] thank you guys, man.

123
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.970
<v 0>When I'm on stage, I get real happy up there.</v>

124
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:05.530
Like maybe that's the only time in my adult life that I feel like myself

125
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.230
standing up there. You know what I mean?

126
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:13.450
Like gladiator and then likes is on him and you look down and everyone's looking

127
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:14.403
at,

128
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:20.470
and it's all of these smiles around you and they get dressed or put

129
00:08:20.471 --> 00:08:24.190
perfume on and stuff. And they're going to see your show. It's the best feeling,

130
00:08:24.191 --> 00:08:25.110
man. I love standing.

131
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.620
That's why I love my obstacle because I understand every practitioner,

132
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.690
whether I grew with them or not. I know where they're coming from.

133
00:08:31.691 --> 00:08:33.640
They want to be heard. They got something to say,

134
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.470
there's something they noticed. They just want to be. I love this job.

135
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:44.110
It's saved my life. These people are at least as influential to me.

136
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.880
As my family, we fight the fuss, jealous of each other.

137
00:08:48.881 --> 00:08:49.930
We get mad at each other,

138
00:08:49.931 --> 00:08:53.770
but my life wouldn't have been what it was without each and every one of them,

139
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.670
I, those will always be my. Cause I grew up with them.

140
00:08:58.671 --> 00:09:02.300
It was way bigger than hip hop. That's like kind of like that was our work.

141
00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.180
Those my life. I grew up with them cause we was like this.

142
00:09:05.181 --> 00:09:06.920
So nothing never come between them. You know what I'm saying?

143
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:10.430
<v 1>You're watching this. I appreciate that Justin. And I want you to know,</v>

144
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.220
everybody. Dave Chappelle understands.

145
00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:21.260
<v 4>It's always a really gratifying experience making these videos that take a more</v>

146
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.890
documentary and look at a single artist, whether it's Chappelle Quintin,

147
00:09:24.891 --> 00:09:28.220
Tarantino, or Bo Burnham, delving into an artist's body of work,

148
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:32.150
always provides a window into their soul. It's also why I love Dan Dan Lee,

149
00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.480
his class creating a modern cinematic documentary with soul.

150
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:39.440
It's an invaluable guide to crafting a story out of someone's life experience.

151
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.530
For me, it alone made my Skillshare membership worth it.
