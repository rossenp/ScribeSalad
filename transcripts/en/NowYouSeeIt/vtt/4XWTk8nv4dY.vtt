1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.020
<v 0>Now you're from Boston.</v>

2
00:00:01.021 --> 00:00:04.620
So you from the safe suburbs ever since Goodwill hunting came out,

3
00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:08.520
everybody thinks everyone from the Boston area lived in Southie and got into

4
00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:12.720
fights and smashed bottles over people's heads because you play a tough guy

5
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:14.280
doesn't mean lace curtain, Irish

6
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.093
[inaudible]

7
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.373
[inaudible].

8
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.950
<v 1>When you think of Boston, what comes to mind? World-class universities,</v>

9
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.550
the Irish Marky, Mark, whatever you think of,

10
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.700
it's likely influenced by the many iconic films set there,

11
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.520
but movies like Goodwill hunting and the department didn't come up with the

12
00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:45.170
Boston identity out of nowhere,

13
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.750
it comes in part from the history of the city itself.

14
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.010
A history largely defined by the conflict between working class Catholics and

15
00:00:52.011 --> 00:00:55.310
the wealthier Protestant elite in the 18th and 19th century.

16
00:00:55.311 --> 00:00:59.780
The Boston ruling class consisted exclusively of British Protestants associated

17
00:00:59.781 --> 00:01:02.630
with elite Cambridge universities, but in the 18 hundreds,

18
00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:06.440
thousands of Irish immigrated to Boston and threatened the Protestant control.

19
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.380
The Boston community responded with systemic discrimination,

20
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.400
early loss in Boston,

21
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.550
outright banned Catholicism and Irish people couldn't attend.

22
00:01:13.551 --> 00:01:14.600
Ivy league schools.

23
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.590
Poor Irish communities were relegated to South Boston below the Charles river.

24
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.430
But as their numbers grew, Irish people gained political control of the city.

25
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.100
<v 0>After an Irishman, couldn't get a job. We had the president.</v>

26
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.780
<v 1>The Boston Irish history created a cultural identity around being the underdog,</v>

27
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.120
even though they became the ones in power.

28
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.570
And it's from the old conflict between Protestant and Catholic,

29
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.650
British and Irish and Cambridge and South Boston that we see where Boston

30
00:01:42.651 --> 00:01:45.110
stereotypes come from. So let's get into it.

31
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.620
<v 0>Well, because you have the same kind of background. My background, Oh,</v>

32
00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:51.320
you're from the same neighborhood he's from Southie.

33
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.060
<v 1>The subtext of Goodwill hunting is the conflict between the Cambridge elite and</v>

34
00:01:56.061 --> 00:01:57.320
poor Irish Catholics.

35
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.980
The film regularly establishes Southie as Irish through color scheme,

36
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.890
the opening shot shows an Irish flag over Will's fireplace.

37
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.190
The next several shots all have some form of that green, white,

38
00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:10.010
and orange color scheme associated with the Irish flag.

39
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.860
The most compelling example in the beginning is the green, white,

40
00:02:12.861 --> 00:02:14.750
and orange buildings they drive past.

41
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.990
But the color scheme is also in the shot of the old woman on her porch.

42
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.560
The characters even wear them Chucky with his white and green jacket and will

43
00:02:21.561 --> 00:02:23.090
with his orange and maroon one,

44
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.760
all these shots established Southie and to the people in it.

45
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.890
As Irish as throughout the rest of the movie,

46
00:02:27.891 --> 00:02:31.220
they constantly surround themselves with green Irish imagery in gritty

47
00:02:31.221 --> 00:02:32.240
neighborhood bars.

48
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.020
The neon sign next to Chuckie is a Shamrock with Southie written inside it.

49
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.130
And all these Irish blue collar areas are the exact opposite of this.

50
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.130
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

51
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.650
<v 1>It's polished, perfectly matching and elitist.</v>

52
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.370
Instead of the Irish flag shots of the Cambridge elite have American flags in

53
00:02:49.371 --> 00:02:50.000
the background.

54
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.900
We see this imagery most prominently in the Harvard bar behind the pretentious

55
00:02:53.901 --> 00:02:55.370
Harvard students. And of course,

56
00:02:55.371 --> 00:02:57.890
as Chuckie tries to impress the girls with his knowledge,

57
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.160
he has a Guinness sign him in the movie.

58
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.030
The American flag is always associated with the people at odds with the poor

59
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:07.720
Irish from Southie. There are American flags behind the intellectual elite,

60
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.790
the justice system and big government,

61
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.790
and the film regularly places will within that conflict,

62
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.110
fighting the pressures to become a certain type of American ideal Sean's office

63
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:20.410
is the room where will comes to terms with his past and figures out what to do

64
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:21.160
with his life.

65
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.730
It's no coincidence that this room has both an American flag and Irish

66
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.593
paraphernalia.

67
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.650
The film establishes the specific Cambridge Southie conflict in Boston,

68
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.720
but it doesn't really give a solution for it.

69
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.170
Instead of deciding either to remain in Southie or get a white collar job,

70
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.370
we'll abandon the conflict altogether and goes out West by making this maneuver.

71
00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:42.910
It carefully sidesteps the conflict between the elites and the Irish.

72
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.410
He doesn't have to pick a side,

73
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.520
but not every Irish movie has clear Irish and American imagery like in Goodwill

74
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:51.430
hunting. Some movies show the conflict in different ways.

75
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.130
Manchester by the sea shows the class divide in Boston.

76
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.130
Although it does only take place in the greater Boston area.

77
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.240
In the opening montage,

78
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.480
Lee works as a handyman and a Southern Boston suburb that night.

79
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.020
He goes to a bar and has a stare down with what the script describes as two

80
00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:07.270
businessmen. He then starts a fistfight with them.

81
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.360
It's no coincidence that the movie establishes Lee as blue collar.

82
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.540
And then right after that, he picks a fight with two white collar men,

83
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.440
but a more unexpected conflict happens later when Patrick visits his born again,

84
00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:19.210
a mom and her new fiance, Jeffrey,

85
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.230
the scene shows how the Irish in Boston also stand out by being Catholic instead

86
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:23.880
of Protestant.

87
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.850
<v 2>So you can say, amen, Patrick, nobody's trying to recruit you.</v>

88
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.420
<v 1>In the 18 hundreds laws in Boston discriminated against Catholics.</v>

89
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.250
While the legal distinction is long gone.

90
00:04:32.251 --> 00:04:35.310
The cultural differences between Catholics and Protestants have stayed

91
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.360
Manchester by the sea.

92
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.050
It uses this religious conflict to reinforce the emotional distance between

93
00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:44.160
Patrick and his mother. It's a subtle distinction, rarely seen in Boston movies,

94
00:04:44.161 --> 00:04:47.940
but it's still an underlying component of what makes Protestant America feel

95
00:04:47.941 --> 00:04:49.330
different from Irish Catholic.

96
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.760
<v 2>It was very Christian, you know, work Christian too, right? Yes.</v>

97
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.270
I know that you are aware of the Catholics are Christians.

98
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.950
<v 1>It's worth noting that before the mother gets her life together.</v>

99
00:05:01.951 --> 00:05:04.140
She's a drug addict who abandoned her family.

100
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.800
It's a pretty common trope in Boston movies to have a blue collar identity in

101
00:05:07.801 --> 00:05:11.910
women come off as unseemly while in men it's charming in gone, baby gone,

102
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.180
Helene McCready's character is a junkie and an irresponsible mother.

103
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.600
So the characters in power decide what's best for her and her daughter,

104
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.700
whether it's the detectives or her working class,

105
00:05:20.701 --> 00:05:24.390
brother-in-law everyone seems to want to take away Helene's agency compare

106
00:05:24.391 --> 00:05:25.950
Helene to Madeline in the department.

107
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.430
Madeline is educated and wears a Harvard t-shirt indicating that she's

108
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.720
upper-class superior. Cause she went to college for Colin Sullivan.

109
00:05:33.721 --> 00:05:36.630
She's his trophy for breaking free from his Southy background.

110
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.560
Women in Boston movies are commonly either deserving of pity or a status symbol.

111
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.010
There are another way for Boston movies to create distinct differences between

112
00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:47.310
groups I'd argue that you can even see a subtle difference between the two

113
00:05:47.311 --> 00:05:49.260
groups in something as simple as coffee.

114
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.600
Fancy coffee is for snobs into outsiders, right?

115
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.300
<v 2>Might get me a cup of coffee for the hell. Is it a cafe.</v>

116
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.160
<v 1>Dilemma? And Dunkin donuts is for the average American, like.</v>

117
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.270
<v 3>The mayor of Dunkin is the face and Dunkin donuts, right? I like Dunkin donuts,</v>

118
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.390
but have you been to a Dunkin donuts that doesn't have a homeless guy standing

119
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:08.330
in front? Is that part of the design plans?

120
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.740
<v 1>Even though Dunkin donuts is actually a popular nationwide chain,</v>

121
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.830
it's become a signal of blue collar people in film and TV.

122
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.390
So in the case of a Boston movie,

123
00:06:16.391 --> 00:06:19.750
people who drink Duncan must also be from Southie man. It's the same.

124
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.910
<v 3>As Dunkin donuts costs just in terms of price.</v>

125
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:22.840
<v 1>But Irish imagery,</v>

126
00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:26.470
religious differences and taste and coffee only show up in some of the Boston

127
00:06:26.471 --> 00:06:26.950
movies.

128
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.430
There is one symbol of the Southeast Cambridge conflict that almost every Boston

129
00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:34.030
movie has the Charles river neighborhood.

130
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.620
Every Boston movie understands that the Charles river separates the elites from

131
00:06:38.621 --> 00:06:39.130
the poor.

132
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.060
When the poor Irish people want to do a hit or a robbery or go to their day job,

133
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.900
there is always a shot from South looking North towards the Charles river at

134
00:06:46.901 --> 00:06:50.050
Cambridge or downtown Boston as expected in the town.

135
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.590
The camera's starts South of Boston. And the first robbery is in Cambridge,

136
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.450
right outside the Harvard subway station.

137
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.970
And this geographic distinction is historically accurate.

138
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.840
Irish immigrants often crossed the Fort point channel and Charles river to work

139
00:07:01.841 --> 00:07:05.440
in blue collar jobs for academic and to upper-class institutions.

140
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.020
Boston movies have always established this division,

141
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.840
but they challenge it differently depending on the movie and movies like the

142
00:07:10.841 --> 00:07:13.060
boondock saints, the town and domestic river,

143
00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:17.050
the Irish decide to operate outside of the system that oppresses them and take

144
00:07:17.051 --> 00:07:18.670
the law into their own hands.

145
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:22.120
They fulfill the fantasy that a person doesn't have to subject themselves to the

146
00:07:22.121 --> 00:07:25.990
unfairness of the current legal system. Instead they criminally work around it,

147
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.020
forming their own gangs, who exploit or take down the system,

148
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.760
a system represented by cops,

149
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.490
the government or the upper-class in these Boston movies.

150
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.200
It's always us versus them,

151
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:39.370
but all the stereotyping and generalizing begs the question are the lines that

152
00:07:39.371 --> 00:07:42.040
clearly drawn according to the department. They're not.

153
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.480
<v 0>When I was your age,</v>

154
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:47.770
they would say we could become cops or criminals today.

155
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:52.330
What I'm saying is this. When you're facing a loaded gun,

156
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.153
what's the difference.

157
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:56.170
<v 1>Instead of fighting the system,</v>

158
00:07:56.171 --> 00:07:59.770
the department tries to infiltrate it from within the film quickly establishes

159
00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:01.090
the two groups early on,

160
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.630
instead of Cambridge elite society is represented by the Boston state house.

161
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.810
I mean, you move in your upper class by about Tuesday. Unlike will hunting.

162
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.660
Common wants to rise into upper society. What are you looking at?

163
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:12.400
And because he's not a super genius,

164
00:08:12.401 --> 00:08:14.890
he's held back by his background on his way up.

165
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.760
<v 0>Got it. Your father was a janitor. The son's only a cop.</v>

166
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.800
So you're a cop as state police, detective I'm one more up. Oh,

167
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.600
fancy policeman. Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

168
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.900
<v 1>Collin's a criminal. Just like the characters in other Boston movies.</v>

169
00:08:28.901 --> 00:08:31.630
But with one big difference, he's trying to go legit.

170
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.870
Despite the blurring of groups and the characters attempt to rise above his

171
00:08:34.871 --> 00:08:37.510
origins in Southie the movie has a depressing message,

172
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.250
but if you're a rat and you're from Southeast,

173
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.010
no matter how much you try to rise up, you'll pay the price.

174
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.620
<v 0>Are always rising, a fallen in America. My right.</v>

175
00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:47.590
We said that Hawthorne.

176
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.430
<v 1>And for Billy cost again, it's all the same.</v>

177
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:53.530
Even though he tries to do the right thing.

178
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.220
How can families dive into this healthy projects like ticks.

179
00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:00.750
<v 0>Three deck amend at best? I know your father was a man.</v>

180
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.793
Could have been anything.

181
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.560
Are you trying to say that he was nothing saying he worked at the airport?

182
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:11.280
I know what you are. Okay. I know what you are. And I know what you're not.

183
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.470
I'm the best friend you have on the face of this earth.

184
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:17.400
And I'm gonna help you understand something you punk, you know, cough.

185
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:23.000
<v 1>The tragedy of the department is that despite how hard the characters try to</v>

186
00:09:23.001 --> 00:09:25.220
escape the circumstances of their birth,

187
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.560
they still suffer the fate of a common criminal.

188
00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.070
When they were born into a lower class Irish family in the South of Boston,

189
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.390
their future was sealed,

190
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.090
But the departed aunts, all other Boston movies,

191
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.680
miss the true reality of the Boston Irish, they did escape their roots in South.

192
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.430
The end did make their way to the state house. After the Irish gained control,

193
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:47.600
the wealth discrimination,

194
00:09:47.601 --> 00:09:51.410
the religious conflict and the geographic separation of the rich and the poor

195
00:09:51.411 --> 00:09:55.610
still existed. But the Irish became the leaders of Boston and in doing so,

196
00:09:55.611 --> 00:09:59.660
they gradually turned what was once a marginalized identity into an identity

197
00:09:59.661 --> 00:10:01.130
that the whole city embraced.

198
00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.930
So movies about Boston focus on the memory of Irish people as the underdogs who

199
00:10:05.931 --> 00:10:09.020
struggled to overcome their repression by the Cambridge elite,

200
00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:12.650
Goodwill hunting and other Boston movies become so iconic because they

201
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.170
understand this Irish underdog story.

202
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.070
And to the success of Goodwill hunting made this Irish identity understood

203
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:23.510
outside of Boston. Now Boston Southie and the Irish are inseparable.

204
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.633
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

205
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:33.800
<v 1>Matt Damon and Ben Aflac made such a groundbreaking movie by placing their own</v>

206
00:10:33.801 --> 00:10:38.090
fictional story within the actual Boston environment of the 1990s,

207
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:42.290
they achieved the perfect balance of truth and style that many Boston movies

208
00:10:42.291 --> 00:10:46.070
have since tried to emulate this balance is something I think about when I write

209
00:10:46.071 --> 00:10:49.310
these videos, make it flashy, but keep it true. Author Susan,

210
00:10:49.311 --> 00:10:53.090
or lean talks about the importance of finding your style when writing nonfiction

211
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:55.940
as the writer of the book that inspired the film adaptation,

212
00:10:55.941 --> 00:11:00.110
she clearly understands how a great story uses elements of truth to deliver its

213
00:11:00.111 --> 00:11:00.710
message.

214
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:04.460
