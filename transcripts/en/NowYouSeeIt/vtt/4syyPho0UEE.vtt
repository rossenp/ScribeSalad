00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.613
<v 0>Cut.</v>

2
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.620
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

3
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.800
<v 2>The creepy basement is one of the most well-established tropes in the horror</v>

4
00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:19.370
genre.

5
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.670
And it makes sense that scary movies use basements to frighten the audience

6
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.760
they're confined dark and only have one exit for escape.

7
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.580
We know the threat of basements all too well, which explains why,

8
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.920
even just talking about one can feel ominous.

9
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.440
<v 0>Hey, people have basements in California.</v>

10
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.920
<v 2>The fact that basements are underground adds to their creepiness.</v>

11
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.250
There's something scary about the unknown depths of underground spaces in

12
00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:40.760
general,

13
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.360
which might explain why nearly every ancient culture has some belief in an

14
00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:47.570
underworld, a supernatural world of the dead that's below ground.

15
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.780
And those stories may seem like old tales that we don't believe in anymore,

16
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.080
but their influence still shows up in modern filmmaking, Clarice Starling,

17
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.650
entering a serial killer's dark basement to rescue a young girl in the silence

18
00:00:57.651 --> 00:00:58.250
of the lambs.

19
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.400
It sounds a lot like the Greek story of the prophet Orpheus entering the

20
00:01:01.401 --> 00:01:04.550
treacherous underworlds to rescue your a dicey, but in our storytelling,

21
00:01:04.551 --> 00:01:07.070
the use of underground spaces goes even deeper than that.

22
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.760
When explored the underground actually has a vast collection of symbolic

23
00:01:10.761 --> 00:01:12.470
meanings that you may not have even noticed.

24
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.980
So what are the potential meanings of the underground and how do filmmakers use

25
00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:19.070
them to tell their stories? It's time to explore what lies beneath.

26
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.140
<v 0>Got you. I'm not going down there. Okay. Okay. I'll go.</v>

27
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:25.640
<v 2>For many characters.</v>

28
00:01:25.641 --> 00:01:28.340
The underground represents what they're afraid of in home alone.

29
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.380
Kevin has that classic fear of the basement.

30
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.640
<v 0>I've always been afraid of. [inaudible] stark, weird stuff down there,</v>

31
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.073
and it smells.

32
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.771
<v 2>In the film.</v>

33
00:01:36.771 --> 00:01:40.700
His fear of the basement symbolizes his inability to take care of himself after

34
00:01:40.701 --> 00:01:43.100
his family abandoned him. But once he faces this fear

35
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.490
It shows that his character has grown the confidence to live on his own

36
00:01:49.491 --> 00:01:53.210
characters. Often confront trauma while underground in the silence of the lambs.

37
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.390
Clarice talks about failing to save a screaming lamb as a child.

38
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.000
At the end of the film, instead of saving a literal lamb,

39
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.740
she has to save a symbolic lamb.

40
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.940
A helpless girl held captive by Buffalo bill for Clarice Bill's underground

41
00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:08.240
layer represents her lifelong struggle to silence the lamps that have been

42
00:02:08.241 --> 00:02:10.970
tormenting her. So when a character enters the underground,

43
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.900
they are in a way confronting repressed memories hidden away in their own mind.

44
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.830
The perfect example of the underground representing an individual's own mind,

45
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.630
it's the character Pennywise from it.

46
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.970
Not only does this evil clown live below ground,

47
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.730
but it also morphs into each character's greatest fear.

48
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.780
It's a literal manifestation of their deepest trauma. And in the case of bill,

49
00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:33.350
his trauma comes from never coming to terms with the death of his brother in all

50
00:02:33.351 --> 00:02:36.740
of these films, the underground acts as a space that holds the deepest,

51
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:40.160
most traumatic thoughts in a character's mind in the early 20th century,

52
00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:41.750
psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud,

53
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.570
who developed a theory that call it this space in our minds, the it,

54
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.650
he describes the it as a dark inaccessible part of our personality that stores

55
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.530
are repressed fears, which sounds a lot like the basements in home alone.

56
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.040
And the silence of the lambs for its theory had a massive cultural impact.

57
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.490
It completely changed how people thought about their minds and that new thinking

58
00:02:58.491 --> 00:02:59.890
made its way into filmmaking.

59
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.110
Even though much of Freud's work has become outdated.

60
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:05.980
His theories continued to influence how we think about the mind today in classic

61
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.910
Floridian fashion,

62
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.930
the subconscious in inside out is represented by a dark cave filled with Riley's

63
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:12.250
deep repressed fears.

64
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.750
<v 3>The stairs to the basement.</v>

65
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.620
<v 2>But treating underground spaces as only places of doom and despair.</v>

66
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.950
What's seldom short in many films, the underground does the exact opposite.

67
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.360
It lets characters chillax.

68
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.000
<v 3>Yeah. My basement, the chill zone is where we kill lacks,</v>

69
00:03:27.001 --> 00:03:29.610
like relaxing chill all at once.

70
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.930
<v 2>In real life. Basements give people a space to unwind and hang out,</v>

71
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.240
save from the problems of the world above ground.

72
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.280
And in attempt to protect their masculinity.

73
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.280
Men have invented their own underground space to shield them from the

74
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.470
above-ground pains of dating and marriage. This.

75
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.480
<v 3>Is the man cave. No women allowed in here.</v>

76
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.480
<v 2>In more dramatic films, basements protect people from harm.</v>

77
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.000
They can temporarily keep a family safe for monsters,

78
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.430
or they can let you make math without the cops finding out.

79
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.060
I'd be willing to bet that movies actually more often portrayed basements as a

80
00:03:57.061 --> 00:03:59.220
place of protection than a place of danger.

81
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.670
Whether an underground layer protects your secret identity or an underground

82
00:04:02.671 --> 00:04:05.070
civilization protects you from a robot invasion.

83
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.790
The underground creates a space that hides characters from both literal and

84
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.070
metaphorical danger at the end of super bad,

85
00:04:11.071 --> 00:04:13.980
Seth and Evan retreat to Evan's basement to have a sleepover.

86
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.770
And they confess how much they cherish each other. In this scene,

87
00:04:16.771 --> 00:04:20.250
the underground basement acts as a place where they can both be vulnerable and

88
00:04:20.251 --> 00:04:23.100
no longer have to act cool like they do in the rest of the film,

89
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.800
the setting calls back to their lifelong childhood friendship,

90
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.880
and it's a comfortable space.

91
00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:30.000
They will have to let go of when they go to different colleges for Seth and

92
00:04:30.001 --> 00:04:32.940
Evan, the childhood basement represents a time they enjoy together,

93
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.580
but also a time they have to move on from, as they grow up.

94
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.980
Many films treat underground spaces as comfortable,

95
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.050
but sometimes they can become too comfortable.

96
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.680
A character stuck in a basement can symbolize someone unable to handle the real

97
00:04:43.681 --> 00:04:44.310
world.

98
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.130
<v 3>Meeting with dry bird left bed tasting house,</v>

99
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.790
the flubby failures when bringing his basement.

100
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.810
<v 2>The classic example of the cushy underground is the loser who still lives in his</v>

101
00:04:54.811 --> 00:04:55.620
mom's basement.

102
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.770
Although these days that feels more like a smart financial decision than the

103
00:04:58.771 --> 00:05:01.470
sign of a loser. But to keep the story moving and narrative films,

104
00:05:01.471 --> 00:05:04.470
almost always challenged that initial safety of the underground,

105
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.140
or they make the safe underground, create a new problem.

106
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.650
A bunker may protect characters from the dangers of the outside world,

107
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.740
but they don't protect them from the people they're now stuck with the

108
00:05:13.741 --> 00:05:15.630
claustrophobia of underground spaces.

109
00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:19.530
Often forces people into conflict with one another. In war of the worlds reign,

110
00:05:19.531 --> 00:05:23.280
his daughter finds refuge from alien invaders by hiding out in a man's basement.

111
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.490
But when the aliens break in, they are at odds with how to deal with them.

112
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.310
Ray wants to keep quiet, but the man wants to fight back.

113
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.170
I think Ray quickly learns that the biggest threat to his daughter's safety

114
00:05:34.171 --> 00:05:37.200
isn't the aliens they're hiding from it's their supposed savior.

115
00:05:37.201 --> 00:05:38.610
They're stuck with underground.

116
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.270
Another film that plays with the uncertain safety of underground spaces is 10

117
00:05:42.271 --> 00:05:43.230
Cloverfield lane,

118
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.110
which constantly makes the viewer question whether or not the bunker is a

119
00:05:46.111 --> 00:05:49.950
shelter from a radioactive atmosphere, or if it's actually a prison cell,

120
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.770
Michelle spends the movie plotting away out then questioning.

121
00:05:52.771 --> 00:05:56.370
If she even wants to get out this claustrophobic underground showcases the

122
00:05:56.371 --> 00:05:59.570
tactics of relationships. It might suck in the bunker,

123
00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:00.860
but outside it's even worse.

124
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.040
<v 4>After I saved you and kept you safe. This is how you repay me.</v>

125
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.940
<v 2>An underground space may protect someone from above-ground catastrophes,</v>

126
00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.090
but it leaves them much more vulnerable to interpersonal conflict with the

127
00:06:13.091 --> 00:06:16.960
people they're stuck with a perfect example of this underground dynamic is

128
00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.710
Walton Jesse working in the meth super lab in breaking bad throughout the early

129
00:06:20.711 --> 00:06:23.620
seasons. The two characters have lots of problems to deal with.

130
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.210
They have to keep their meth making lives,

131
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.340
a secret avoid detection from the cops.

132
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.490
And they struggle with the various challenges of cooking meth in an RV.

133
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.130
But once they move their work into the underground super lab,

134
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.690
many of those problems go away.

135
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.470
The super lab works well and Gus helps protect them from the police at the

136
00:06:38.471 --> 00:06:41.500
beginning, Walton, Jesse treat the job like a typical nine to five.

137
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.080
This underground space protects them from the outside world,

138
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.740
but it also magnifies the existing social problems between the two characters

139
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.490
compare a conflict between Walt and Jesse in the RV to a conflict between them

140
00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.260
in the super lab. In an early episode,

141
00:06:53.261 --> 00:06:55.870
the RV runs out of battery in the middle of the boonies.

142
00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.790
They bicker at each other throughout the episode,

143
00:06:57.791 --> 00:07:01.150
but they mainly try to work together to keep themselves from dying of thirst.

144
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.100
In the fly episode, Walt obsesses,

145
00:07:03.101 --> 00:07:05.680
over killing a fly that has contaminated the super lab.

146
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.410
And throughout the episode, Jesse sees it as a waste of time.

147
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.530
Both situations involve a conflict that they must solve,

148
00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:14.470
but the situation feels completely different in the RV.

149
00:07:14.471 --> 00:07:15.850
It's a matter of life or death.

150
00:07:15.851 --> 00:07:18.400
And while they may not approach the problem in the same way,

151
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.220
they both understand what's at stake. But in the fly episode,

152
00:07:21.221 --> 00:07:24.550
the conflict is much less about the fly itself than it is about the conflict

153
00:07:24.551 --> 00:07:27.400
between Jesse and Walt compared to the RV situation.

154
00:07:27.401 --> 00:07:29.080
The threat feels in consequential.

155
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.530
The biggest conflict comes not from an outside force, but from within

156
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.710
the two can't even agree on whether there's a problem and to all the setbacks

157
00:07:38.711 --> 00:07:42.370
come from the two undermining each other, like when Jesse cuts off the power,

158
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.970
there are many possible interpretations of what the fly symbolizes in this

159
00:07:45.971 --> 00:07:46.570
episode.

160
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.900
But what's clear is that the setting creates a high pressure claustrophobic

161
00:07:49.901 --> 00:07:53.560
environment that forces us to focus on the relationship between Walt and Jesse

162
00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:56.380
because of the isolated space of the underground super lap.

163
00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:00.070
The two have the most revealing personal dialogue in the entire series

164
00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:02.230
throughout breaking bad.

165
00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:05.680
Some of the most important and revealing moments occur in the underground.

166
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:09.130
And the show uses the underground in a variety of ways like many films.

167
00:08:09.131 --> 00:08:11.470
The show uses the underground to keep things safe.

168
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.990
The super lab protects Walt and Jesse from the DEA,

169
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.630
but there's also Walt hiding his money in his crawlspace.

170
00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.930
And Jesse storing the meth setup in his basement to avoid detection.

171
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.810
But there are more cultural functions of the underground that you may not have

172
00:08:22.811 --> 00:08:25.930
considered underground spaces. Don't just protect what is precious.

173
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.050
They also dispose of what is harmful for many crime shows.

174
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.440
The underground is the perfect way to dispose of a body in breaking bad.

175
00:08:32.441 --> 00:08:35.290
Walt and Jesse bring crazy eight to the basement to dispose of him.

176
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.430
While Walt talks with him,

177
00:08:36.431 --> 00:08:39.550
the underground sang reminds us that crazy eights life is on the line.

178
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:43.360
The underground can also allow characters to yield valuable resources.

179
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.450
You can literally yield from the earth by mining for minerals,

180
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.070
or you can even find kid and treasure,

181
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.490
but there are also less literal ways to yield value in the underground.

182
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:52.383
In breaking bad.

183
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:56.760
Gus uses the underground super lab to extract math made by Walt, Jesse.

184
00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.810
But when people are involved, extraction almost always means exploitation.

185
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:01.740
In one episode,

186
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:05.580
Jesse realizes just how valuable their work in the super lab has been for Gus.

187
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.860
<v 1>All right, 96,000,096,</v>

188
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.100
two hour three, that is messed up y'all.

189
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:15.500
<v 2>While waltz scolds him for being ungrateful.</v>

190
00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.080
Jessie points out that the whole deal is unfair.

191
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:23.390
<v 1>Do you live in one where the dudes are actually doing all the</v>

192
00:09:23.391 --> 00:09:25.010
work and getting fisted?

193
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.911
<v 2>He says this,</v>

194
00:09:25.911 --> 00:09:29.990
the camera cuts to a new extreme high angle shot looking down at Jesse as he

195
00:09:29.991 --> 00:09:32.450
rails against the exploitation of his labor.

196
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:36.020
It's no coincidence that Jesse gets framed from such a powerless angle.

197
00:09:36.021 --> 00:09:39.680
When he's feeling ripped off filmmakers often use perspective to emphasize

198
00:09:39.681 --> 00:09:43.280
control a high angle shot makes the character look small and helpless while they

199
00:09:43.281 --> 00:09:45.410
low angle shot. It makes them look powerful.

200
00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.830
Add in the fact that Jesse is underground and it becomes clear that the below

201
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:53.300
ground super lab emphasizes Jessie and waltz powerlessness like the bunker in 10

202
00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:56.360
Cloverfield lane. The lab is both a refuge and a prison,

203
00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:00.200
their boss surveils them constantly. They work under threat of bodily harm.

204
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:01.220
And at the end of the day,

205
00:10:01.221 --> 00:10:05.270
they make a small fraction of what Gus makes the episode box cutter uses the

206
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.290
spacial hierarchy to visually demonstrate Gus as power overwhelmed Jesse,

207
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:12.290
after re-establishing his authority by killing his loyal henchman,

208
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.250
he leaves the lab.

209
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.850
The scene is intentionally shot to emphasize the spatial relationship between

210
00:10:16.851 --> 00:10:20.840
Gus and his employees. He looks down on them and they look back up at him,

211
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.100
defeated and traumatized.

212
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:23.600
<v 1>Get back to work.</v>

213
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.610
<v 2>Your ground is a symbol of Walt and Jesse status as part of an underclass that</v>

214
00:10:28.611 --> 00:10:30.770
serves at the whims of wealthy upper management.

215
00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:34.100
After all breaking bad is a show about class anxiety.

216
00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:37.460
Walt's financial struggles are core to the show and Jessie struggles with this

217
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.860
inability to be a productive member of society.

218
00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.580
It's no surprise then that the show uses the underground so extensively because

219
00:10:43.581 --> 00:10:47.660
it serves as a clear illustration of a hierarchical and exploitated world that

220
00:10:47.661 --> 00:10:50.300
forces them to sell their souls to survive and breaking bad.

221
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:54.170
Isn't the only example of a story that uses the undergrounds to explore class

222
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:54.860
dining.

223
00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:55.693
<v 1>Hammocks.</v>

224
00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.260
<v 2>The film parasites starts with a pedestal shot,</v>

225
00:11:00.261 --> 00:11:03.050
moving downward to reveal a semi underground apartment.

226
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:06.470
The pedestal shot gives subtle cues to the viewer by moving the camera up or

227
00:11:06.471 --> 00:11:08.450
down, it indicates whether a character is.

228
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.780
<v 1>Or powerless. Yes, that should do it.</v>

229
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.050
<v 2>In the case of parasite,</v>

230
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.740
the shot reinforces that this family is part of the powerless underclass.

231
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.920
There are semi underground departments symbolizes their low status in the

232
00:11:24.921 --> 00:11:26.360
socioeconomic hierarchy.

233
00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:29.630
The beginning of the film revolves around the family trying to literally rise

234
00:11:29.631 --> 00:11:31.820
above their station. Even in the very first scene,

235
00:11:31.821 --> 00:11:35.090
they're trying to get reliable wifi by holding their phones up to the ceiling.

236
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.850
Symbolically showing that their success lies upward.

237
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:41.270
When the son gets an opportunity to tutor for a much wealthier family,

238
00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.690
he makes the track to their house and in each shot, he moves upward.

239
00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.070
Along with a pedestal shot.

240
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.820
The film also uses high angle and low angle shots throughout this early sequence

241
00:11:49.821 --> 00:11:53.180
to show power. In the beginning, the camera looks down on the poor family,

242
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.980
but as they infiltrate the rich home, they gained control of the frame at times,

243
00:11:56.981 --> 00:11:58.600
towering over the rich family,

244
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:02.170
both the camera and the above ground setting emphasize the changing hierarchy

245
00:12:02.171 --> 00:12:03.430
between the two families,

246
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.580
but all of that ends with the discovery of a new underground space.

247
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:07.660
The nuclear bunker,

248
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:14.260
This underground space completely reverses the trajectory of the story.

249
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:17.500
In the beginning of the film, the family becomes successful by moving upward,

250
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:20.710
but in a cruel twist of fate, their upward plan starts to unravel.

251
00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:23.590
Once they expose themselves by literally falling downward

252
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:26.620
again,

253
00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:30.400
underground space represents the powerless and the Kim family instantly lose

254
00:12:30.401 --> 00:12:34.210
their control. The nuclear bunker in parasite has many symbolic meanings.

255
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.810
It does protect what is valuable. That's what nuclear bunkers were made for.

256
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.020
They protect people from a potential nuclear attack in the film.

257
00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:43.990
The bunker keeps a man saved from the loan sharks, trying to catch it,

258
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:47.560
but that protection comes at a price and it eventually drives its inhabitants

259
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:48.581
matte and 12,

260
00:12:48.581 --> 00:12:52.390
a bunker doesn't yield value in a literal way like bury treasure or crystal

261
00:12:52.391 --> 00:12:55.270
meth. It does heal the big twist in the story itself.

262
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.840
Parasite follows the tradition of countless films that use an underground space

263
00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.570
as the climactic moment or as a major plot twist.

264
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:05.260
There are lots of films with surprise underground spaces that I won't talk about

265
00:13:05.261 --> 00:13:08.920
to avoid spoiling them, which goes to show just how important those spaces are.

266
00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:09.910
For many stories.

267
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:13.540
What makes parasites such an incredible example of the underground is in how

268
00:13:13.541 --> 00:13:17.080
many ways it uses it to tell its story parasite uses the underground,

269
00:13:17.081 --> 00:13:19.840
not only to emphasize hierarchy and exploitation,

270
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:23.200
but to show how the stench of the underground never really leaves people who

271
00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:24.580
managed to climb their way up.

272
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.730
You can see all these ideas of the underground and the very last shot of the

273
00:13:27.731 --> 00:13:31.180
film after the sun vows to get rich and save his father from the bunker,

274
00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.190
we get the same pedestal shot from the beginning,

275
00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.830
no matter how hard he tries or how much he plans,

276
00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.110
he remains trapped underground, the underground.

277
00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.090
Isn't just a physical space in this film.

278
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.480
It's a social boundary policed by the norms and manners of an upper-class

279
00:13:43.481 --> 00:13:46.960
society with no interest in admitting anyone new in parasite,

280
00:13:46.961 --> 00:13:50.740
there is no meritocracy. The hatch of the underground is locked and sealed

281
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:56.080
Basements. Aren't just scary because they're cold and dark.

282
00:13:56.110 --> 00:14:00.040
They're scary because of their power. As a storytelling device in film and TV,

283
00:14:00.041 --> 00:14:03.370
the underground represents a new unexplored space that may be a source of

284
00:14:03.371 --> 00:14:05.200
safety, danger, or reward.

285
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.680
This unknown creates dramatic tension because it's so unknown.

286
00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:12.490
When we see a basement we're introduced to a completely new space and we have no

287
00:14:12.491 --> 00:14:15.160
idea what's going to be down there waiting for us in a way,

288
00:14:15.161 --> 00:14:19.150
almost every underground space in film and TV yields, something valuable.

289
00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.520
They yield the most valuable part of the story.

290
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.710
So the next time you see a basement in a film,

291
00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.110
don't forget to consider how deep it really goes.

292
00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.610
Like most. Now you see it videos.

293
00:14:41.611 --> 00:14:45.150
