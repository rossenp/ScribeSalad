00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.950
<v 0>When I was taking the script around and,</v>

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.670
and because it's a love story between a mother and a daughter. I remember every,

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.680
every man I talked to who was raised with sisters or who had a

4
00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:13.950
daughter said, I know this that's my wife and my daughter,

5
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.550
or that's my sister and my mom and guys who didn't, as they said,

6
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.260
I don't do women fight like this. Like, Oh,

7
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.920
never seen this because why would you know that this is what

8
00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:27.540
this relationship is.

9
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.010
This is Ripley last survivor of the NIS drama

10
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.553
signing off.

11
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.780
<v 1>The movie.</v>

12
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.980
Alien provides a fascinating case study into how women are typically written in

13
00:00:45.981 --> 00:00:47.330
an early draft of the script.

14
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.840
The screenwriter wrote that the crew's unisex and all parts are interchangeable

15
00:00:50.841 --> 00:00:51.680
for men or women.

16
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.400
The character of Ripley can't really reinforce stereotypes about women because

17
00:00:55.401 --> 00:00:58.610
the writer did not have a woman in mind in the first place. In many ways,

18
00:00:58.611 --> 00:01:02.630
a largely genderless hero is a great character to have in a critically acclaimed

19
00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:03.830
Hollywood blockbuster.

20
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.070
There's something cathartic about not having to think about gender in a main

21
00:01:07.071 --> 00:01:07.580
character.

22
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.270
Writing without a woman in mind means a writer can explore universal human

23
00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:14.540
experiences without worrying about falling into stereotype.

24
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.140
It's definitely fun and exciting to see a character who doesn't get treated

25
00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:19.670
differently because she's a woman.

26
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.210
She is a well-written character with qualities not associated with any

27
00:01:23.211 --> 00:01:24.140
particular gender.

28
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.640
Ripley in alien is a strong woman character because gender plays a very little

29
00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:32.690
role and her strengths could just as easily exist in a masculine character.

30
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.260
Ripley is just one of the many valid ways to approach writing women.

31
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.990
She plays out the fantasy that gender can be ignored,

32
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.150
and that leads to a great movie with a great lead,

33
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.200
but a big strength of film is its ability to tell different human experiences.

34
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.930
And the real world is usually much different than Ripley's.

35
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.300
Your gender plays a huge part in your identity.

36
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.600
There's nothing wrong with a movie that explores a character without exploring

37
00:01:53.601 --> 00:01:54.170
their gender,

38
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.010
but a movie that incorporates gender into the story can lead to moving in

39
00:01:58.011 --> 00:02:00.560
diverse character arts. Good evening. Larry,

40
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.700
maybe the best example of writing women with gender at the forefront is Clarice

41
00:02:04.701 --> 00:02:06.410
Starling. In silence of the lands.

42
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.740
She stands out in the masculine dominated world of the FBI,

43
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.910
and she is rarely taken seriously by her masculine counterparts. Most guys,

44
00:02:13.911 --> 00:02:16.460
either subtly check her out or blatantly hit on her.

45
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.520
Frederick Chilton thinks she was only assigned to interview Lecter because

46
00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:20.354
she's.

47
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.990
<v 0>I graduated from UVA. Doctorate is not a term school. Good.</v>

48
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.820
Then you should be able to remember the rules.

49
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.660
<v 1>Perhaps the moments that emphasize her gender the most are the subjective point</v>

50
00:02:29.661 --> 00:02:31.250
of view. Shots of men gazing at her.

51
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.070
They're always looking at either in contempt or attraction,

52
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.020
clearly marking her as an outsider.

53
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.080
And there's more to pointing out her gender than just to show sexism in the

54
00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:42.740
workplace for gender has clearly shaped parts of her character arc.

55
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.890
She personally identifies with the women abducted by Buffalo.

56
00:02:45.891 --> 00:02:47.210
Bill seemed the wake of,

57
00:02:47.211 --> 00:02:50.150
one of the girls gives her a flashback of her father's death.

58
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.630
The opening shot of the movie has Clarice pulling herself up the Hill and her

59
00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:56.630
goal in the movie is to save the captured girls from holes.

60
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.490
They cannot pull themselves out of what did you do?

61
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.640
<v 0>I went downstairs.</v>

62
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.940
I crept up into the barn. So scared to look inside.

63
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.520
What did you see, Larry? What did you see?

64
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.990
Screaming? You ran away.

65
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.740
Catherine. I'm going to get you out of there right now.

66
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.510
<v 1>Listen to me,</v>

67
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.050
the climactic finale of the movie is the ultimate visual link between the

68
00:03:34.051 --> 00:03:38.070
Buffalo bill abductions and the men looking down on Clarice in Buffalo bills

69
00:03:38.071 --> 00:03:41.040
layer. He watches over her while she's unable to see him.

70
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.330
Don't you feel eyes moving of your body. Clearly, of course,

71
00:03:45.331 --> 00:03:47.910
this scene is creepy and incredible all on its own,

72
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.130
but it also means more because she is a woman.

73
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.180
And because we have already inhabited her perspective as a woman in a world

74
00:03:54.181 --> 00:03:56.280
where men glare at her and objectify her,

75
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.190
she has a universal journey of triumph against adversity,

76
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.580
but the obstacles in her path are shaped by the fact that she is a woman.

77
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.610
If she were played by a man, the movie would feel drastically different.

78
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.590
Unlike Ripley in alien starlings,

79
00:04:07.591 --> 00:04:10.200
gender elevates the emotional payoff of the movie.

80
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.980
Starlings gender is a key component of her character arc. It's a realistic,

81
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.420
grounded and important story,

82
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.840
but a movie starring a woman doesn't always have to focus on the struggles of

83
00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:19.674
being a woman.

84
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.570
<v 0>Satisfaction.</v>

85
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.330
<v 1>The Brighton kill bill is certainly not genderless.</v>

86
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.960
Her story begins when she's shot at her own wedding while pregnant immediately

87
00:04:30.961 --> 00:04:34.530
after waking from a coma, she goes on her quest for revenge on her assailant,

88
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.760
her former lover bill,

89
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.270
the bride embodies the character traits of a traditional masculine hero.

90
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.900
Revenge is a classic staple of drama and a common plot line for narratives.

91
00:04:42.901 --> 00:04:46.710
Typically starring men in contrast alien and silence of the lambs have more in

92
00:04:46.711 --> 00:04:48.300
common with a survival narrative,

93
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.790
Ripley survives and invasion of an alien monster.

94
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.280
Starling does choose to confront the villain herself,

95
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.150
but much of her story involves surviving events that are out of her control.

96
00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.490
She has to withstand the gaze of other men,

97
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.420
especially in the climates when she's blind to the villains,

98
00:05:02.421 --> 00:05:06.330
staring right at her with kill bill. The story is completely driven by the hero.

99
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.350
Her journey is not a situation she's thrust into, but rather a conscious plan.

100
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.670
She devised for herself.

101
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.900
This quest for revenge echoes the popular storylines of old American westerns

102
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.370
were heroes decide to reconcile some past trauma like Ripley in alien.

103
00:05:20.371 --> 00:05:23.250
She fulfills a fantasy of transcending her gender,

104
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.320
but instead of being genderless like Ripley,

105
00:05:25.321 --> 00:05:29.490
the bride fulfills the fantasy of being the action hero archetype traditionally

106
00:05:29.491 --> 00:05:32.730
associated with a man. The bride does not act gender neutral.

107
00:05:32.731 --> 00:05:34.320
She acts in a masculine way,

108
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.050
just like the male heroes before her she's aggressive.

109
00:05:37.051 --> 00:05:40.230
She takes charge of the story and she gets her revenge kill.

110
00:05:40.231 --> 00:05:43.920
Bill fulfills the fantasy that a female character can act like a male hero.

111
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.410
The movie gives a fresh perspective on writing women.

112
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.080
She is never a victim in this movie when men wrong her,

113
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:50.790
she always fights back immediately.

114
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.250
Starling had to tolerate the men in her life,

115
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.880
but the bride doesn't have to like the characters before her she's tapping into

116
00:05:56.881 --> 00:05:59.900
the fantasy of being able to right every wrong.

117
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.950
The trade-off is that this movie does not seem to tap into a distinctly feminine

118
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:04.760
experience.

119
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.360
What I mean by that is her near death feels like this symbolic death of a

120
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:11.060
delicate more feminine side of her as appropriate.

121
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:13.340
And bad-ass as this transformation might be,

122
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.300
there does seem to be a part of the female experience missing in this story.

123
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:18.770
All three of these movies, right?

124
00:06:18.771 --> 00:06:21.410
Women with some element of a masculine perspective.

125
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.350
Elian is a movie where the characters could have been played by men.

126
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.070
The silence of the lambs has Clarice interacting almost exclusively with men and

127
00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:30.650
kill. Bill has a woman playing a masculine role.

128
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.800
It's also worth noting that all of these movies were written and directed by

129
00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:37.580
men. So it makes sense that there are some masculine elements in each of them.

130
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.880
Maybe the last piece of the puzzle is a movie that embraces an experience

131
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.110
exclusive to women, right?

132
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.760
<v 2>You're not even worth state tuition, Christine. My name is lady bird. Oh,</v>

133
00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.920
well actually it's not. And it's ridiculous.

134
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.270
<v 1>Most coming of age movies,</v>

135
00:06:49.271 --> 00:06:52.750
Christine's romantic interest in Ladybird are fleeting and unimportant.

136
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.350
She paints over her crushes names before moving out a visual reminder that she

137
00:06:56.351 --> 00:06:59.950
has completely moved on and those relationships do not have a permanent effect

138
00:06:59.951 --> 00:07:03.370
on her. The relationship with her mother is explored with much more detail.

139
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.180
The opening shot instantly shows us the movie's emotional core in the script.

140
00:07:07.181 --> 00:07:10.030
Greta Gerwig describes this opening shot as a modern day,

141
00:07:10.031 --> 00:07:13.030
romantic Mary Kasam rip-off painting of motherhood.

142
00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.870
Mary Cassat was an impressionist painter known for her images of women in social

143
00:07:16.871 --> 00:07:19.360
and private life. Unlike many painters at that time,

144
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.410
Casani consistently portrayed her women with a dignity that suggested deeper,

145
00:07:23.411 --> 00:07:25.420
more intimate views of her characters.

146
00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:29.260
People look at COSATU paintings and relate to the mother child interactions in

147
00:07:29.261 --> 00:07:30.550
their familiar activities.

148
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.580
The thoughtful expressions of many of her subjects gives them a certain

149
00:07:33.581 --> 00:07:36.010
intellectual look like there's more than meets the eye.

150
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.550
I think Greta Gerwig wants to capture that exact spirit in this movie.

151
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.180
Ladybird gives an incredible look at the complicated relationship between two

152
00:07:43.181 --> 00:07:45.910
women who would have thought a mother's opinion on the clothes her daughter

153
00:07:45.911 --> 00:07:47.920
tries on could have so many layers.

154
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:52.540
<v 0>We want you to be the very best version of yourself. That you're</v>

155
00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.110
what if this is the best version.

156
00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.420
<v 1>This scene ends with the mom,</v>

157
00:07:58.421 --> 00:08:01.780
trying to think of what to say and cutting to the next scene before she's able

158
00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:05.380
to Gerwig noted that lady bird and her mother are most intimate when they are

159
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.030
unconscious. In the first frame,

160
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.180
we will never see them be this close to each other for the rest of the film.

161
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.310
Ironically, they also look extremely similar,

162
00:08:12.311 --> 00:08:15.760
which Gerwig reinforces in the match cuts of them driving despite their

163
00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:16.421
similarities.

164
00:08:16.421 --> 00:08:19.090
These characters try to be as different from each other as possible.

165
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.750
It's this complicated back and forth relationship that makes their scenes so

166
00:08:22.751 --> 00:08:23.530
full of death.

167
00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:27.640
<v 0>You are so infuriated, stop yelling, not yelling, Oh,</v>

168
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:29.380
I love it.

169
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.700
<v 1>The characters are imperfect.</v>

170
00:08:30.701 --> 00:08:34.300
And most importantly vulnerable while there's value in the female bad-ass is

171
00:08:34.301 --> 00:08:35.050
like kill bill.

172
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:38.650
There's also a strength in embracing the weaknesses and faults a person can

173
00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:39.070
have.

174
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:42.790
It's about covering the entire spectrum of human experience where a female can

175
00:08:42.791 --> 00:08:45.790
act masculine in one movie and feminine in another women,

176
00:08:45.791 --> 00:08:48.910
directors and writers can give an honest and relatable depiction of women

177
00:08:48.911 --> 00:08:53.020
experiences. In addition to the fantasies of FBI agents, space, explorers,

178
00:08:53.021 --> 00:08:53.830
and assassins,

179
00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:56.790
and it's important that all these kinds of characters exist for women.

180
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:00.060
Each of these characters gives us a different look into the human experience.

181
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.190
Maybe a well-written character played by a woman,

182
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:03.870
challenges you to think a little differently.

183
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.020
Maybe they challenge you to look without gender or to see women from a new

184
00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:08.910
perspective. If it works, it works.

185
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:12.540
There's no wrong way to write women at the end of the day.

186
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.780
The great part about cinema is how it gives us a window into worlds.

187
00:09:15.781 --> 00:09:19.050
We wouldn't have seen on our own combine that with the connectivity of the

188
00:09:19.051 --> 00:09:21.030
internet and the possibilities are endless.

189
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.390
If you're looking to expand your understanding across many different subjects,

190
00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.410
then I highly recommend the award-winning documentaries. On curiosity stream.

191

192

196
