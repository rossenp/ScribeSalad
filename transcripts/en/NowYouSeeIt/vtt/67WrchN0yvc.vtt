00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.253
<v 0>Unbelievable.</v>

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.640
Historically movies and TV shows have had a problem showing what coding and

3
00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:12.330
hacking is actually like. I think, you know what I'm talking about, I'm trying,

4
00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:13.320
it's moving too fast.

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.000
Many filmmakers used to not bother making their scenes accurate.

6
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.600
They went with their own idea of hacking that looks exciting and feels intense.

7
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.820
They were probably afraid that if they went, realistically,

8
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.500
they'd end up with something like this.

9
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.450
<v 1>So I go through these thousands of lines of code and, uh,</v>

10
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.120
it doesn't really matter.

11
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.060
<v 0>So with a few exceptions hacking in the nineties and two thousands is either</v>

12
00:00:35.061 --> 00:00:38.210
highly exaggerated or incomprehensible. It's honestly,

13
00:00:38.211 --> 00:00:40.310
I don't blame the filmmakers for making this choice.

14
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.560
Watching someone sit at a computer is boring.

15
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.250
And the vast majority of movie goers didn't have a clue how hacking works.

16
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.530
Most of them probably didn't care how it worked anyway,

17
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.940
but in the last 10 years or so,

18
00:00:49.941 --> 00:00:52.610
there's been a big shift in how movies and TV portray hacking.

19
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.790
Maybe it's because the public better understands how technology works,

20
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.360
or maybe it's because people want more realistic storytelling, whatever it is.

21
00:00:59.361 --> 00:01:03.830
Modern shows like Mr. Robot now have extremely accurate hacking scenes and even

22
00:01:03.831 --> 00:01:06.470
comedies like Silicon Valley puts some effort. In fact,

23
00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:08.360
checking the technology they're making fun of,

24
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.490
but even with all this new technical accuracy,

25
00:01:10.491 --> 00:01:12.170
there's still a bit of deception going on.

26
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.130
Filmmakers still make hacking out to always be this incredibly complicated

27
00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:18.350
process that requires a technical genius.

28
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.710
<v 1>You made it really hard for anyone to see it, but I saw it.</v>

29
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.000
<v 0>Reality. A lot of the hacking you see on the big screen is surprisingly easy.</v>

30
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.420
Sometimes it's so simple. You don't even need experience to understand it.

31
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.600
All you need is an internet connection and a basic understanding of a few

32
00:01:32.601 --> 00:01:34.490
vulnerabilities to prove my point.

33
00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:37.400
Let's analyze the sequence from the social network and see if you can do some

34
00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:39.440
hacking yourself. Let the hacking begin

35
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.741
in this scene.

36
00:01:42.741 --> 00:01:46.190
Mark Zuckerberg hacks into websites on the Harvard network and steals pictures

37
00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:49.730
of female students for his face mash app. Not only is this scene realistic,

38
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.030
but it's hacking that Mark Zuckerberg actually did in 2003.

39
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.310
He documented his techniques in an online journal.

40
00:01:55.311 --> 00:01:58.310
And some of the dialogue in the movie is taken word for word from it.

41
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.490
They keep everything open and allow indexes in their Apache configuration.

42
00:02:01.491 --> 00:02:04.670
So little w you get magic as all that's necessary to download the entire

43
00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:05.151
Kirkland,

44
00:02:05.151 --> 00:02:09.470
Facebook kids stuff based on how he delivers this line and how quickly the

45
00:02:09.471 --> 00:02:11.300
moment flies by the average movie.

46
00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:14.930
Goer might think that this hacking is only kid stuff for a genius like Mark

47
00:02:14.931 --> 00:02:17.570
Zuckerberg, even screenwriter, Aaron Sorkin felt this way.

48
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.340
<v 1>With her scenes in the social network. Honestly,</v>

49
00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:22.550
I don't understand when he's telling us how he's hacking into things,

50
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.100
that's acquired knowledge, it's phonetic knowledge.

51
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.550
<v 0>But this is probably the easiest hacking out there that I promise you can do.</v>

52
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.230
And I'll prove it to you go to Jack

53
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.410
mnuchin.io/youtube mash in your favorite browser.

54
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.990
It's a website built like Mark Zuckerberg space match site,

55
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.900
except instead of comparing girls at Harvard, you can judge all of now.

56
00:02:38.901 --> 00:02:40.190
You see it's past videos,

57
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.580
go to the logo in the top left corner and view the image.

58
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.140
Every browser lets you do this,

59
00:02:45.141 --> 00:02:46.940
but the option just has a slightly different name.

60
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.770
Once you're at the page with the image,

61
00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:51.080
you just need to remove the name of the image from the URL.

62
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.620
And you get a list of all the thumbnails from every now you see a video and

63
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.100
there you have it. You're a hacker like Mark Zuckerberg. That's all that he did.

64
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.990
It's true that he was clever enough to check if this website had this

65
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:05.980
configuration and he also knew about w get a package that lets you download all

66
00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:09.070
the images on a webpage, but this really is kid stuff.

67
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.190
You don't need to be a hacking expert to check if an images location,

68
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.810
isn't a website's public directory.

69
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.850
If you tried this technique on other websites,

70
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:18.460
it's probably not going to work because most websites have tightened their

71
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:20.020
security. Since 2003,

72
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.990
even this website is just faking it as if this video is published.

73
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:26.140
Date apache.org/icons, still indexes images,

74
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:28.420
the exact same way that sucker Burk exploited.

75
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.730
If you want to see a patchy indexing in the wild.

76
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.500
<v 2>Excellent moving right along.</v>

77
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.850
<v 0>Later in the scene,</v>

78
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.120
the market needs to quickly get a large stash of photos for face match.

79
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.110
So he writes some code.

80
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.941
<v 2>To do at a time.</v>

81
00:03:38.941 --> 00:03:41.940
And there's no way I'm going to go to 500 pages to download picks one at a time.

82
00:03:41.941 --> 00:03:44.850
So it's definitely necessary to break out Emacs and modify that Perl script.

83
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.350
<v 0>He solving a simple problem.</v>

84
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.980
It would take too long to manually go through every page and download the

85
00:03:49.981 --> 00:03:53.460
thumbnails. Instead he writes a few lines of code that repeat the process.

86
00:03:53.461 --> 00:03:56.760
We just went through for every page on the site. Not so complicated.

87
00:03:56.761 --> 00:03:57.594
If you think about it,

88
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.620
if you want it to do this on the Jack nugent.io/youtube mash site,

89
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.110
the random video button gives you a random thumbnail.

90
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.160
You could go through all the URLs for each video and do the same thing he did.

91
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.910
I'm doing it with slightly different code, but it's still the same idea.

92
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.990
And now that you've got all the images, it's time to make Facemash.

93
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:17.543
<v 2>The algorithm.</v>

94
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.220
<v 0>Support algorithm is usually abused in movies to make something instantly sounds</v>

95
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.910
Epic.

96
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.730
<v 2>I did was come up with my own kick algorithms.</v>

97
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.750
<v 0>But an algorithm is simply a step-by-step solution to any problem.</v>

98
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.260
It's an equation it's code, or it's even a recipe for making food.

99
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.310
The algorithm for Facemash is copying what chess players use to calculate their

100
00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:38.910
ratings.

101
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.900
Let's say the matrix a different perspective has a rating of 1600 and why jump

102
00:04:42.901 --> 00:04:44.910
scares. SOC has a rating 1200.

103
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.630
The score just tells us the likelihood that a video will win in any given

104
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.820
matchup. The higher a videos ELO.

105
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.360
The more likely it is to win because the matrix video has a higher rating.

106
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.460
It's expected to win 90% of the time.

107
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.400
And the jump scares video it's expected to win 10% of the time,

108
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.570
depending on who wins. Another algorithm adjusts, each video score.

109
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.440
If a video wins that isn't expected to win the algorithm adjusted score more

110
00:05:07.441 --> 00:05:10.500
drastically because the video's current score is apparently too low.

111
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.820
Each video starts with a rating of 1400 and the algorithm takes it from there.

112
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.010
These equations are the exact same way.

113
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.830
Chess players get their ELO scores and it's the same way.

114
00:05:19.831 --> 00:05:22.470
Mark Zuckerberg ranked women on their attractiveness.

115
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.650
And now I'm using the same algorithm to find out what you really think of. Now.

116
00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:26.610
You see it videos.

117
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.840
The social network is an example of the current trends to make hacking and

118
00:05:30.841 --> 00:05:33.180
movies and TV more accurate. But at first glance,

119
00:05:33.181 --> 00:05:35.940
the movie still portrays having as incredibly complicated.

120
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.420
It only feels that way because they make the dialogue really fast and throw in

121
00:05:39.421 --> 00:05:42.110
software jargon like Apache w get an email.

122
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.720
And then all of a sudden it feels like you have to be a genius to understand it,

123
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.300
but you can do that with anything related to technology.

124
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.930
I can do the same thing with my YouTube mash website, spin up a static site,

125
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.620
easy.

126
00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.220
I'll just create an S3 bucket underneath the CDN surface with SSL encryption.

127
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.330
Then all I have to do is pages Gatsby for Lightspeed performance and automate

128
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:01.730
deployment with the [inaudible] algorithm, kids stuff.

129
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.640
All that is just a fancier way of saying I made a website.

130
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.180
Of course not all hacking is as easy as what they did in the social network,

131
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.270
but filmmakers don't seem to differentiate the simple from the difficult.

132
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.750
So the next time you see an insane hacking scene, that makes no sense to you.

133
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.300
Don't forget that you can still hack like Mark Zuckerberg.

134
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.780
<v 3>Welcome to Facebook. [inaudible].</v>

135
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.780
<v 0>Keegan movies and TV has become more realistic.</v>

136
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.750
At least partially due to an increasing computer literacy.

137
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.540
The average person knows more about computers than ever before.

138
00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.320
And our entertainment reflects that it's never been easier to learn how to build

139
00:06:35.321 --> 00:06:38.140
a website or exploit the faults in what you can learn,

140
00:06:38.141 --> 00:06:40.930
how to make websites using YouTube stack overflow,

141
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.710
or there's a great tutorial by Christopher Todd called understanding web

142
00:06:44.711 --> 00:06:45.430
development.

143
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.360
It's an incredibly explained to introduction to the basics of making your own

144
00:06:49.361 --> 00:06:52.030
website from scratch. If you want to check out this video,

145
00:06:52.031 --> 00:06:53.470
you can view it on Skillshare.

146
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.100
Skillshare is an online learning community that can help you learn and grow.

147
00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.960
Even with a busy schedule classes,

148
00:06:58.961 --> 00:07:01.630
cover every topic from film production to coding.

149
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.840
So if you're interested in diving deeper into what I discussed today,

150
00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:06.790
it's the perfect resource to get started.

151
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.010
So now that you know how to hack like Mark Zuckerberg,

152
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.410
you can learn how to code like him too, but don't worry.

153
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.020
You don't have to afford a Harvard education to get there.

154
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.630
An annual subscription is less than $10 a month.

155
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.050
And the first 500 of my subscribers that click the link in the description,

156
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.660
we'll get a two month free trial of premium membership.

157
00:07:22.661 --> 00:07:25.750
So you can explore your creativity. Plus it helps us out too.

158
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.930
Thank you guys so much for watching and getting this far in the video.

159
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.850
I thought of the idea for this video over the summer,

160
00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:32.710
but I put it on the back burner because I was worried.

161
00:07:32.711 --> 00:07:34.360
It didn't really fit the style of the channel.

162
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.450
I was able to make the video I wanted to make because you guys were there

163
00:07:37.451 --> 00:07:40.030
supporting the channel the whole time. We want it to make an interesting,

164
00:07:40.031 --> 00:07:40.721
weird video.
