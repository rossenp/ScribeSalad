00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.210
<v 1>Everybody knows a great movie when they see it,</v>

2
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.010
but sometimes it's hard to put your finger on what exactly made it work.

3
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.860
We usually judge effective moments based on their shot, composition,

4
00:00:15.861 --> 00:00:17.540
character choices, or dialogue,

5
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.590
but sometimes powerful thematic choices come in unexpected ways in the opening

6
00:00:21.591 --> 00:00:22.550
scene of the godfather,

7
00:00:22.551 --> 00:00:25.520
the light hits America in a way that makes him look like a rat,

8
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.220
emphasizing his portrayal of the Italian way of life.

9
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.650
But the most powerful moment comes later in the scene.

10
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.980
It took over a minute to understand that America is at odds with his Italian

11
00:00:33.981 --> 00:00:35.270
identity, but for veto,

12
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.180
it takes us only a tiny moment to learn just as much about him.

13
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.010
All it took was a wave of his hand,

14
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.550
Like many cinematic techniques, a hand can convey a lot of visual information,

15
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.480
depending on the context, it can symbolize power, the unknown or affection,

16
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.850
and you can even see it in action. 80 years ago

17
00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.650
In 1936 Chevrolet released a sponsored documentary film titled master hands,

18
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.440
showing the work that goes behind making a Chevrolet car.

19
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.010
The film focuses on the hands of anonymous workers as they built a car from

20
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.933
them.

21
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.770
<v 0>From the master of the tool makers to the</v>

22
00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:14.120
hands that mastered.

23
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.670
<v 1>At the end of the documentary hands clutched the newly finished car and drive</v>

24
00:01:19.671 --> 00:01:22.850
off the film, shoots the hands on the steering wheel, the same way at shot,

25
00:01:22.851 --> 00:01:24.170
the hands, making the car.

26
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.740
And this association of hands sends a clear message to consumers.

27
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.640
Chevys are sold to the same blue collar hands that also make them pairing the

28
00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:33.920
producers of the car with the consumers of the car.

29
00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:37.580
Also supports the idea that a worker directly benefits from the work they put

30
00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:40.280
in, but in 1936, the workers didn't feel that way.

31
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.330
The mid 1930s actually had some of the most violent worker strikes in American

32
00:01:44.331 --> 00:01:44.930
history.

33
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.600
<v 0>And labor brought back with the dome or anything.</v>

34
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.950
<v 1>In his article, hands off the machine historian.</v>

35
00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:55.970
Max Frazier talks about the use of hands in the art of the 1930s to symbolize

36
00:01:55.971 --> 00:01:56.990
the working class.

37
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.260
The instincts to associate hands with the working class makes sense.

38
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.880
Most low paying jobs required tedious manual labor and artists saw the effect of

39
00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:07.790
those jobs in people's hands in media. At the time,

40
00:02:07.791 --> 00:02:10.640
there are generally two types of pants in master hands.

41
00:02:10.641 --> 00:02:12.590
They show the benefits of manual labor.

42
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.010
They look productive and efficient helping to create a car. In the end,

43
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.490
in this film, hands don't challenge, their mistreatment or act on their own.

44
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.180
The hands are almost extensions of the machines themselves repetitive and

45
00:02:23.181 --> 00:02:25.070
complacent in their singular task.

46
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.520
But those hands were much more oppressed than the documentary implies.

47
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.090
The workers, films and master hands actually went on strike the following year.

48
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.640
Now the hands are the second type, not working hands,

49
00:02:34.641 --> 00:02:36.410
but protesting hands free to move.

50
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.190
As they please a hands not performing manual labor has a completely different

51
00:02:40.191 --> 00:02:44.240
symbolic meaning than the working one. Instead of doing tasks for a corporation,

52
00:02:44.241 --> 00:02:47.120
these hands act on their own free to do what they want.

53
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.660
It makes sense that these free hands became a symbol that labor parties and

54
00:02:50.661 --> 00:02:53.930
communists embraced. When a free hand doesn't perform work,

55
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.640
it's resisting the status quo.

56
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.030
These two kinds of hands reflect the level of control that a person,

57
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.840
either their hands do what they're told like in master hands or they resist and

58
00:03:02.841 --> 00:03:05.050
act on their own like during a worker strike.

59
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.800
And we see this dual symbolism of the hand in feature film because the hand is

60
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:11.080
such a good way to show a person acting on their own.

61
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:15.430
Self-interest a hand oftentimes represents a person's control or a lack of

62
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:17.140
control. Of course, hands and movies.

63
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:20.140
Don't always have to contain some grand symbolic meaning,

64
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.940
but if you approach them from this angle,

65
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:25.720
you may see some patterns in how they're used. Every human has hands.

66
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.290
So it's a pretty accessible symbol in popular culture that filmmakers use in a

67
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:33.430
variety of contexts. The symbolic power of hands is almost unlimited.

68
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.220
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

69
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.910
<v 1>The force essentially functions as hand superpowers, fader chokes,</v>

70
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.260
an adversary from afar with just a small pinch of his fingers and uses his hands

71
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.880
to stop lasers in their tracks.

72
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.570
The force extends the user's physical control into their environments.

73
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.590
Not only are you in control of yourself, but you can literally control others.

74
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.160
It's the ultimate way to show power. So if hands give people control,

75
00:04:02.161 --> 00:04:03.930
then losing a hand, does the opposite,

76
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.590
loosen your hand in a star Wars film means much more because hands are such a

77
00:04:07.591 --> 00:04:09.510
symbol of power without his hand,

78
00:04:09.511 --> 00:04:13.890
we feel unsure if Luke will regain the same mastery over the forest that he had

79
00:04:13.891 --> 00:04:14.430
earlier,

80
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.150
it's the total loss of control of his hands that contributes to the feeling of

81
00:04:18.151 --> 00:04:19.890
defeat at the end of empire,

82
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.880
while Vader wants to sever Luke's powerful hand SAR on wants to empower the

83
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.110
hands in Lord of the rings. The most powerful tool is not a crown or a necklace.

84
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.830
It's a ring,

85
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.310
a ring empowers a person's hand in the same way that a tool raised in the air

86
00:04:32.311 --> 00:04:33.810
empowers a factory worker,

87
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.960
but ultimately a hand wearing a ring is not a free hand.

88
00:04:36.961 --> 00:04:40.890
And by creating desire for power, the ring, ironically enslaves,

89
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.070
not unlike the factory workers under the control of their company,

90
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.750
fantasy films use hands and the extension of a person's hands to show power or

91
00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:52.770
the lack of it. And that includes the most popular franchise in recent memory,

92
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.730
like the ring and the force be infinity gauntlet gets a lot of its symbolic

93
00:04:56.731 --> 00:04:58.550
strength. By focusing on the hand,

94
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.920
the gauntlet feels like one of the most intimidating weapons put to film because

95
00:05:01.921 --> 00:05:05.730
it extends the control of a hand into control of the fabric of the entire

96
00:05:05.731 --> 00:05:09.570
universe. It's certainly cool that Santos can use the gauntlet to control moons.

97
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.270
<v 0>You thrown her moon at me and I'm going to lose it, but we see it.</v>

98
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.650
<v 1>How are the most when he does so much more with such a little gesture,</v>

99
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.130
with a simple snap of his fingers, he alters the course of the entire.

100
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.470
<v 0>Universe. It's.</v>

101
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.050
<v 1>Basically the opening of the godfather on steroids,</v>

102
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.750
both banjos and veto essentially use their hands in the same way before Vito

103
00:05:30.751 --> 00:05:31.141
speaks.

104
00:05:31.141 --> 00:05:35.070
He gives a command with his hands to get America a drink with such a small

105
00:05:35.071 --> 00:05:37.320
gesture. He can control the world around him.

106
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.670
The hand movement shows Vito's power precisely because the gesture is so small

107
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.350
by placing the hand in the foreground,

108
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.460
it dominates the scene and conveys visual authority. When Vito does his gesture,

109
00:05:47.461 --> 00:05:50.010
America is literally in the Palm of his hands.

110
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.370
Paul Thomas Anderson uses a similar method in there will be blood.

111
00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.260
You often sensors the frame on the hand to subtly communicate important bits of

112
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:03.680
information while a different film might cut to closeups of faces or the map

113
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.580
Anderson has the confidence to stick to this wide shot and use hands to direct

114
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:10.670
our eyes. And if anyone's hands command attention throughout the scene,

115
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:11.480
it's Daniels,

116
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.810
he doesn't even have to directly face the camera to command to the screen.

117
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.660
When he goes to shake Paul's hand, his hand cuts across the frame,

118
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:18.980
preventing Eli from leaving.

119
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.890
This motion feels aggressive despite just being a handshake.

120
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.730
It's a small example of Daniel's manipulative personality disguised as just the

121
00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:28.220
simple work of a businessman throughout the rest of the film.

122
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.400
Daniel's hands are a main focus for his character. He regularly.

123
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.150
<v 0>Grabs and slaps.</v>

124
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.270
<v 1>And he always does. So to express his authority,</v>

125
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.210
the film follows the power struggle between him and Eli.

126
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.750
So it makes sense that they use their hands to attempt to take control.

127
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:47.381
In this scene.

128
00:06:47.381 --> 00:06:51.430
Daniel asserts his authority and Eli stands by looking powerless with his hands,

129
00:06:51.431 --> 00:06:54.040
a little lower than the center of the frame. In many ways,

130
00:06:54.041 --> 00:06:57.070
they are like the hands of America. Also tightly contained.

131
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.270
The one big difference though,

132
00:06:58.271 --> 00:07:02.110
is that America's hands tremble and move around randomly while Eli remained

133
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.620
steady.

134
00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.370
It turns out that Eli was only holding back and we see the true power of his

135
00:07:06.371 --> 00:07:08.200
hands. When he leaves church here,

136
00:07:08.201 --> 00:07:11.290
he has the authority to point grab and even slap Daniel.

137
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.740
At this point in the film, Eli has just as much power, but of course,

138
00:07:14.741 --> 00:07:18.730
it's Daniel who wins in the end. And once again, his hands dominate the frame,

139
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:19.630
right?

140
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.480
<v 0>Drink your milkshake.</v>

141
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.700
<v 1>But thinking about hands only as a symbol of a power dynamic sells them short.</v>

142
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.390
Many of the most famous hands in movie history don't necessarily fit into that

143
00:07:31.391 --> 00:07:31.900
idea.

144
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.470
The problem is that we've been thinking of hands as an extension of the power of

145
00:07:35.471 --> 00:07:38.410
a human, but what if the hand isn't even human in the first place?

146
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.080
And what if the hand isn't even attached to anything?

147
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.140
There's a common horror trope of the severed hand that still moves.

148
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.600
There's something frightening about a hand without its master,

149
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.970
possibly because it literally has a mind of its own.

150
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.650
If a hand represents control,

151
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.890
then losing control of your hands would be the ultimate loss of agency.

152
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.430
Unusual hands make their way into the horror genre because we all have an

153
00:07:57.431 --> 00:08:00.460
understanding of what a hand should be. And it's the part of our body.

154
00:08:00.461 --> 00:08:04.480
We use the most for everyday tasks and understanding of what's normal and common

155
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.080
gives the filmmaker the opportunity to show that someone or something is

156
00:08:08.081 --> 00:08:09.760
abnormal in district nine,

157
00:08:09.761 --> 00:08:13.390
wikis starts turning into an alien after accidentally spraying himself with a

158
00:08:13.391 --> 00:08:16.540
mysterious liquid. So which body part becomes alien first.

159
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:19.960
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

160
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.980
<v 1>And to as expected his hands changing, the NC can now fire alien weapons,</v>

161
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.170
not only do his hands represent the abnormal,

162
00:08:26.171 --> 00:08:30.580
but they still show the classic power dynamic ITI introduces the idea that an

163
00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:35.410
alien hand doesn't have to be evil before ITI aliens almost always appeared as

164
00:08:35.411 --> 00:08:38.500
the villain and to their foreign hands meant they were a threat to the norm,

165
00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:42.460
but each uses his hands to show his trust in Elliot life King Kong.

166
00:08:42.461 --> 00:08:45.580
It challenges the assumption that a foreign hand has to be an evil one.

167
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.890
We've been ignoring the most important reason for hands.

168
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.850
The kind of hands we hopefully see most often in our everyday lives. The trust.

169
00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:56.280
<v 2>Hands are an easy way to visualize cooperation.</v>

170
00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:02.090
<v 1>It goes against the idea that hands are used to dominate a situation.</v>

171
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.060
They can also show cooperation and affection, hand touching.

172
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.790
Is it always cold and power hungry? Like the kiss of death,

173
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.290
a movie like call me by your name,

174
00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.220
feel so warm and loving because characters regularly touch and hold each other.

175
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.990
And not just in a romantic way.

176
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:19.130
Elio's dad speaks to him in a surprisingly tender way about his relationship and

177
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:20.150
ask the scene fades out.

178
00:09:20.151 --> 00:09:23.630
He reaches out to touch it in contrast to the doubt in American beauty never

179
00:09:23.631 --> 00:09:24.560
touches anybody.

180
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.800
Once he finally does it's in such an awkward and unfulfilling way,

181
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.550
or maybe the dad's hand is too controlling. Oh, my thin old,

182
00:09:31.551 --> 00:09:36.140
my fan Marlin and finding Nemo has to accept that he can never entirely control

183
00:09:36.141 --> 00:09:37.190
and protect NEMA.

184
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:41.030
We see as conflict manifested literally when he holds onto the whale's tongue,

185
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:42.860
but instead of a hand, it's a flipper.

186
00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:47.630
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

187
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:50.000
<v 1>So hands really are the visible part of the brain.</v>

188
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.180
If some people literally use their hands as a language,

189
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.330
I don't think it's much of a stretch to think that filmmakers can use hands to

190
00:09:56.331 --> 00:09:58.070
communicate complicated ideas.

191
00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:01.910
<v 0>Control good, or the lack of it,</v>

192
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.700
the foreign or the familiar.

193
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.480
<v 1>The loving, or the sassy ones.</v>

194
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.010
It's definitely a weird way to look at a scene, but who knows?

195
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.310
Maybe one day it'll come in handy. I'm not sure what to do with my hands. Oh,

196
00:10:19.311 --> 00:10:21.260
it'd be good. Just hold them down by your side. Yeah. Great.

197
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.040
Of course the symbolic history of hands goes back much further in other art

198
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:25.550
forms.

199
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:28.670
There's a fascinating history behind the study of hands and art during the

200
00:10:28.671 --> 00:10:32.570
Renaissance era artists like Michelangelo and DaVinci had a fixation on the

201
00:10:32.571 --> 00:10:35.540
anatomy of the hand that was both scientific and aesthetic.

202
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.850
I definitely recommend checking out the documentary,

203
00:10:37.851 --> 00:10:41.360
the Renaissance factor because it goes into details beyond the scope of this

204
00:10:41.361 --> 00:10:44.510
video. It's a fascinating watch that outlines the advances in art,

205
00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.290
in science that prompted this focus on anatomy. You can watch it on curiosity,

206
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.101
