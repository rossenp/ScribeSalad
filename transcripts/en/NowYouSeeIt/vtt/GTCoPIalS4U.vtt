1
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.670
<v 1>American world war II movies definitely have their own John rhe.</v>

2
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.330
They typically deal with the American sense of duty sacrifice and focus on a

3
00:00:14.331 --> 00:00:14.661
hero,

4
00:00:14.661 --> 00:00:18.260
participating in a battle against good and evil Vietnam war movies have their

5
00:00:18.261 --> 00:00:22.310
own genre to centering on conspiracy distrust and moral ambiguity.

6
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.210
But is there a genre for the Iraq war? What do Iraq war films have in common?

7
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.510
It's certainly possible that not enough time has passed for a strong narrative

8
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.640
about the American occupation of Iraq,

9
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.990
but it's been 17 years since we invaded in 2003 and almost 30 years since the

10
00:00:35.991 --> 00:00:39.620
first Gulf war in that same time period. After the start of the Vietnam war,

11
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.230
we had classics like apocalypse now, and the deer Hunter,

12
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.020
these films had already defined the Vietnam war genre,

13
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.610
the anti-war movement sweats,

14
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.400
the U S and defined the themes in films like platoon,

15
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.590
where the American soldiers are. The antagonists,

16
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.610
the chaos and senseless violence in the film shows us how the country felt about

17
00:00:55.611 --> 00:00:56.720
the war. At that time,

18
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.830
the genre elements of world war II and Vietnam war movies reflect American

19
00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:02.600
feelings about those conflicts.

20
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.150
But what are the genre elements of Iraq war films?

21
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.100
Let's see if we can find any common threads.

22
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.390
<v 2>What's the best way to go about this army. One of these things,</v>

23
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.053
the way you don't die, sir.

24
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.780
<v 1>One of the most prominent Iraq war films is Kathryn.</v>

25
00:01:17.781 --> 00:01:21.410
Bigelow's 2008 best picture winner. The hurt locker. It's about a reckless,

26
00:01:21.411 --> 00:01:24.050
but prolific explosive ordinance disposal technician,

27
00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:27.260
and his team as they count down their days until deployment is over.

28
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.300
Sergeant James is the best of the best.

29
00:01:29.301 --> 00:01:33.590
He's technologically gifted unfazed by high stress situations and is in and out

30
00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:36.410
with little to no mess. In short he's a specialist,

31
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.410
Iraq war films typically focus on special forces.

32
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.050
And that's because unlike in world war II and Vietnam,

33
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.710
there was no draft that draft made war something everyone had to possibly

34
00:01:45.711 --> 00:01:48.020
participate in whether they wanted to or not.

35
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.440
That's my world war II and Vietnam films tend to focus on the grunts,

36
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.830
the enlisted infantry men who are just cogs in a much larger machine.

37
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.220
They are the every man, Tom Hanks is a school teacher in saving private Ryan.

38
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.070
And the main characters in the deer. Hunter are steel mill workers.

39
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.970
These films tell the stories of average Joes who get caught up in the chaos and

40
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:06.140
can't wait to go home.

41
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.250
<v 2>I was going to him now and finding him so he can go home.</v>

42
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.560
If that earns me the right to get back to my wife. Well, then,

43
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.860
then that's my mission.

44
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.880
<v 1>Indirect contrast. Iraq war films are about people who want to be there.</v>

45
00:02:19.881 --> 00:02:23.330
And sometimes they actually thrive in the chaos without a draft.

46
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.330
The Iraq war was more removed from everyday American life.

47
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.690
Add in the fact that a large part of the military in the middle East was made up

48
00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:33.620
of mercenary contractors and the American army turned into a job for just a

49
00:02:33.621 --> 00:02:36.230
select few who chose to be there. Iraq war,

50
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.070
movie center on a warrior class of specialized units, such as in the films,

51
00:02:40.071 --> 00:02:42.350
American sniper, zero dark 30, and the hurdle.

52
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.890
<v 0>Got tools got to right let's rock and roll. Man.</v>

53
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.850
<v 1>Sergeant James in the hurt locker perfectly embodies the warrior class mentality</v>

54
00:02:49.851 --> 00:02:51.680
of American soldiers in the Iraq war.

55
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.580
He's a specialized elite soldier equipped to deal with the exact nature of the

56
00:02:55.581 --> 00:02:57.440
war and his first scene in combat.

57
00:02:57.441 --> 00:03:01.000
He expertly diffuses a roadside bond right off the bat.

58
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:04.540
We see he has the technical expertise that an enlisted soldier would not have.

59
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.260
And his technical expertise applies to more than just a fusing the bomb itself

60
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.640
before he diffuses the bomb.

61
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:12.880
He also diffuses a tense situation with an Iraqi civilian.

62
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.120
The film sets up Sergeant James as a warrior soldier that can do it all.

63
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.120
He not only diffuses bombs, he also diffuses conflict.

64
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.110
So a key Shandra element of many Iraq war films is the painting of American

65
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:27.400
soldiers as vocational well-trained warriors that can deal with both combat and

66
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:28.630
civilian occupation.

67
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.560
American sniper focuses on a highly specialized sniper who can spot a bad guy

68
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.550
amongst the civilians and other films like lone survivor and zero dark 30

69
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:40.570
exclusively show elite special forces who avoid civilian casualties.

70
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.470
Active Valor took this fixation on specialized forces to the extreme and

71
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:48.370
recruited real life seals to portray themselves clearly playing into the

72
00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:49.870
admiration of elite talent.

73
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.880
The emphasis on small elite groups and their interactions with civilians makes

74
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:57.040
these films feel intimate and personal.

75
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.580
Most of these films dive into the psychology of being a soldier.

76
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.760
Trauma is a common topic in many Iraq war films.

77
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.150
Many of the films show the soldiers at home and the trauma that they bring with

78
00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:07.360
them.

79
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.960
These films are very sympathetic to the ordeals that a soldier goes through,

80
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.500
which contrasts the infamously poor treatment of Vietnam soldiers by the

81
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:16.120
American public. When they returned home,

82
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.260
there are quite a few Iraq war films that focus heavily on the trauma of combat

83
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.170
like yellow birds. Thank you for your service and American sniper,

84
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.980
which devotes its last act to addressing Chris Kyle's post traumatic stress

85
00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:30.370
disorder. Spending more time on the psychological effects of war shows.

86
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:34.030
America's new understanding of mental illness and contrast with earlier war

87
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:37.840
films that either overlooked trauma resolved it easily or went to the extreme

88
00:04:37.841 --> 00:04:39.940
and showed soldiers as just psychotic,

89
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.270
but highlighting the trauma of American soldiers and limiting the scope of the

90
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:46.300
film to a specialized few has a secondary effect.

91
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.140
It ends up avoiding broader questions about whether the Iraq war was justified

92
00:04:50.141 --> 00:04:52.630
in the first place like many Iraq war films,

93
00:04:52.631 --> 00:04:55.570
the hurt locker treats America's presence in the war as fact,

94
00:04:55.571 --> 00:04:59.320
and does not question the war in any meaningful way at another film that also

95
00:04:59.321 --> 00:05:03.220
overlooks the morality of the Iraq war is the most successful Iraq war, movie,

96
00:05:03.221 --> 00:05:04.120
American sniper.

97
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.620
<v 3>Protecting my guys. They were trying to kill our soldiers and, uh,</v>

98
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.190
I'm willing to meet my creator and ask for every shot that I took.

99
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.390
<v 1>Chris Kyle is the prime example of a dutiful soldier in the film.</v>

100
00:05:15.391 --> 00:05:19.170
He's motivated exclusively by a desire to protect the lives of his teammates.

101
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.930
He's willing to put himself in extremely dangerous situations.

102
00:05:21.931 --> 00:05:25.500
If it means he can save lives, I'm going to go clear houses with Marines.

103
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.720
And though these experiences caused him trauma.

104
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.350
The film ultimately tells us it's worth it because he saved American lives.

105
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.980
Your dad, he's a hero on the surface.

106
00:05:34.981 --> 00:05:38.490
This stance appears a political because Kyle is just protecting soldiers in

107
00:05:38.491 --> 00:05:39.720
dangerous situations,

108
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.110
but did those soldiers have to be there in the first place earlier in the film,

109
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.590
Chris Kyle's dad lectures him on the importance of using violence to protect

110
00:05:46.591 --> 00:05:48.210
others. And while he lectures,

111
00:05:48.211 --> 00:05:51.630
the film cuts to Chris as a child using violence to protect his brother.

112
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.150
<v 3>When there are those who are blessed with the gift of aggression and the</v>

113
00:05:56.151 --> 00:05:57.000
overpowering need to.

114
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.090
<v 1>This scene clearly serves as an analogy for Chris's role as a sniper in the Iraq</v>

115
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:05.120
war. He's just using violence to protect people in danger.

116
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.760
But if you look at this fight as a metaphor for the Iraq war,

117
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.030
the moral justification breaks down, what's beating up this other kid,

118
00:06:11.031 --> 00:06:13.280
really the only option to protect his brother.

119
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.790
And did he really have to continue punching the other kid even after his brother

120
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:17.690
already escaped?

121
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.140
Even though the film appears to not take a stance one way or the other on the

122
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:22.250
validity of the war,

123
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.880
the narrow focus on the individual totally simplifies the moral greatness of the

124
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:28.370
actual Iraq invasion. Nowhere along the way,

125
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:31.610
does it consider that the best way to support the troops is to keep them out of

126
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.980
harm's way in the first place. And it never questions.

127
00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:37.190
Whether troops are actually improving the situation in Iraq,

128
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.850
the film tries to evoke the same feeling Americans had during world war two.

129
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.640
There was good and evil, and we had to fight on the side of good,

130
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:44.503
no matter the color.

131
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.800
<v 2>I just want to believe in what we're doing here. Oh, there's evil here.</v>

132
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.360
We've seen it in reality.

133
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.470
<v 1>Iraq war has much more in common with the moral grayness of Vietnam because both</v>

134
00:06:53.471 --> 00:06:57.400
conflicts have since been seriously questions all across the political spectrum.

135
00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.440
So really American sniper tries to give a world war two type moral absolutism to

136
00:07:02.441 --> 00:07:06.400
a Vietnam award type conflict and other popular Iraq war films.

137
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.060
Also try redressing the Iraq war with a morally righteous story.

138
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.020
Zero dark 30 is honest about some controversial aspects of the war,

139
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.390
but it's still avoids questioning the war itself.

140
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.080
The film justifies the shocking torture scenes by having the torture result in

141
00:07:20.081 --> 00:07:23.500
crucial information about Ben lien's. Whereabouts in reality,

142
00:07:23.501 --> 00:07:26.380
America discovered bid LUNs location from surveillance,

143
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.620
not torture and torture has been routinely questioned as an effective

144
00:07:29.621 --> 00:07:32.140
interrogation tactic, just like American sniper.

145
00:07:32.141 --> 00:07:36.070
This film creates a scenario where the justification for violence appears

146
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.611
obvious,

147
00:07:36.611 --> 00:07:40.060
but only because the film framed that scenario in a way that overlooks the

148
00:07:40.061 --> 00:07:41.500
broader context of the war.

149
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.740
Contrast these films with film flight platoon and the deer Hunter were the

150
00:07:44.741 --> 00:07:48.730
horrors of war crimes are addressed head on and clearly portrayed as a mistake

151
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.310
or even world war II films like saving private Ryan.

152
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.610
Where interesting questions do get raised about the justification of their

153
00:07:54.611 --> 00:07:58.570
mission because world war II and Vietnam war films make moral judgments about

154
00:07:58.571 --> 00:07:59.830
their respective conflicts.

155
00:07:59.831 --> 00:08:03.580
That honesty allows them to address more interesting questions about war in

156
00:08:03.581 --> 00:08:07.390
general, overall mainstream Iraq, war films,

157
00:08:07.391 --> 00:08:11.500
focus on specialized experts and their individual experiences in combat.

158
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:15.460
And that focus means that these films rarely address moral issues about the Iraq

159
00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:19.390
war as a whole, not to mention they completely overlook the Iraqi perspective.

160
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.300
Maybe this is why the genre doesn't have its apocalypse. Now,

161
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.130
if a war film wants to be truly great,

162
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.070
it needs to confront the messy reality of the war that it's about.

163
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.760
Although most mainstream Iraq war films avoid the messy realities.

164
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:34.060
There are some films that do address American involvement in the middle East in

165
00:08:34.061 --> 00:08:35.020
challenging ways.

166
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:39.190
<v 2>Are you even doing here? I got lost on the way up.</v>

167
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.700
<v 1>It's a 2005 film about infantry men in the Gulf war, though.</v>

168
00:08:45.701 --> 00:08:49.330
It is about a different war. Its time of release setting and subject matter.

169
00:08:49.331 --> 00:08:53.260
Make it feel comparable to an Iraq war film and unlike most Iraq war films

170
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:56.940
Jarhead does have something insightful say about American involvement in the

171
00:08:56.941 --> 00:08:58.920
middle East in the film Swafford character.

172
00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.430
Satirizes the American fantasy of a morally justified war effort.

173
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:06.090
It feels almost as if Swafford watched American sniper and got the impression

174
00:09:06.091 --> 00:09:08.250
that he could be a hero too. But from the beginning,

175
00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:11.400
the film rejects the idea that he's a morally righteous character doing the

176
00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:15.150
right thing. He was manipulated into joining the military. He's sickly,

177
00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:19.080
obsessed with killing the bank. And in the end,

178
00:09:19.081 --> 00:09:21.240
he was completely worthless to the war effort.

179
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.950
I never shot her right after a grueling experience in bootcamp and months of

180
00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:29.070
waiting in the hot desert, all the soldiers want is to get into battle.

181
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.970
But when it finally comes the enemy retreats almost instantly American air

182
00:09:32.971 --> 00:09:35.550
power, easily overpowered the Iraqi army.

183
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.390
<v 4>Like a slope. They already retreat. All right,</v>

184
00:09:38.391 --> 00:09:41.690
we can shoot a thousand yards to go that far in Vietnam.

185
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:46.130
That would take a week more one a year here. It's going to take about 10.

186
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.090
<v 1>They then spend the rest of the film, walking through the carnage,</v>

187
00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.280
wrought by a war that moves too fast for them.

188
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.190
And when Swafford finally gets his chance to fire his weapon.

189
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:59.540
<v 4>What the frequency are you all. We got here.</v>

190
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:04.550
<v 1>Like other Iraq war films. It focuses on the experience of the American soldier,</v>

191
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.310
but that experience is not one of duty and honor.

192
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.460
It's one of psychological torture, the scars they bring home,

193
00:10:10.461 --> 00:10:14.450
aren't shown as sacrifices for our freedom. Instead, the film leaves you asking,

194
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:15.620
what was it all for?

195
00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.640
In one particularly poignant scene Swafford and his battalion cheer on the

196
00:10:19.641 --> 00:10:22.910
flight of the Valkyries scene from apocalypse now as if it's a football game,

197
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:27.500
but that scene is itself a satire of military heroism. So when they cheer it on,

198
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.150
they're obviously missing the point.

199
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:32.030
The film even gets cut off before the explosion start.

200
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.190
So they never get their climactic ending.

201
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:38.120
This scene shows the soldiers failure to even imagine a morally justified

202
00:10:38.121 --> 00:10:41.180
conflict. They completely misread the messaging and apocalypse.

203
00:10:41.181 --> 00:10:44.930
Now a film that actually reflects the chaos and pointlessness of the Vietnam

204
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.410
war. This scene feels like a commentary on war films. In general,

205
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.800
it's saying that people who watch war films struggled to see the immorality of

206
00:10:51.801 --> 00:10:56.060
war when focusing just on the spectacle of American soldiers in combat and films

207
00:10:56.061 --> 00:10:59.750
like American sniper and zero dark 30 further remove films from reality by

208
00:10:59.751 --> 00:11:03.380
creating moral dilemmas that avoid asking the actual tough questions,

209
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:07.040
but Jarhead does capture the true moral ambiguity of the Wars in Iraq.

210
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:07.821
In reality,

211
00:11:07.821 --> 00:11:12.380
the Gulf war and Iraq war were far more complex and Jarhead addresses the

212
00:11:12.381 --> 00:11:14.840
pointlessness of American involvement in the middle East.

213
00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:17.570
Instead of relying on a simple support, our trips narrative,

214
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.390
that doesn't really have anything insightful to say about war,

215
00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.760
whether you support it, the war or war against it.

216
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:26.900
The reality is that many Americans felt like Swafford watching a war that didn't

217
00:11:26.901 --> 00:11:31.670
make sense completely unable to either help or stand against it. We are still

218
00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.780
in the Tesser jar,

219
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:38.450
had had a mixed reviews when it came out in 2005,

220
00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:40.400
those skepticism of the war was high.

221
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:44.150
Americans may have been disappointed with a meandering story without the violent

222
00:11:44.151 --> 00:11:47.060
catharsis they thought they would get when they bought their tickets to a war

223
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.090
film. But looking back, it might've been ahead of its time to this day.

224
00:11:50.091 --> 00:11:54.490
We are still involved in military operations in the middle with no end in sight.

225
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:58.180
The violence that happens abroad is abstract and removed from the American

226
00:11:58.181 --> 00:11:58.630
people,

227
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:02.620
films like the hurt locker and American sniper represent an escapist desire to

228
00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:05.620
create clear lines between good and evil in the middle East.

229
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.840
But the reality is far more complex.

230
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.960
There's still plenty of time for more films like Jarhead to come out that bring

231
00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:15.010
a more nuanced take on ideas of heroism and violence. And I think they will.

232
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.080
But while that happens, we're all still in the dark.
