<v 0>[Inaudible] sign an executive order, military porn.</v>

2
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.890
What is it? Closed? And flights have been grounded.

3
00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:40.610
Stranding millions of travelers who have lost all contact with the outer

4
00:00:40.611 --> 00:00:41.420
extremities.

5
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.210
As the Dow Jones industrial average fell over 2000 points in its worst week.

6
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.293
Leading line.

7
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.310
[inaudible] indicate battle all over the world.

8
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.333
You want to fund me?

9
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.810
[inaudible] this is like the end of capitalism.

10
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.010
This is like the dorky just all over again. Then I wake up today in hospital,

11
00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:16.550
the Waco hallucinate norm.

12
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:18.703
Okay, Jim,

13
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.913
what else is left?

14
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.490
But to abandon even the hope of truth and content ourselves instead,

15
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.500
which stories

16
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.590
can you look me in the eye until you've got this under control and it's not

17
00:01:39.591 --> 00:01:42.560
going to end up in a disaster. Yes.

18
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.320
I don't know any numbers yet. What do you think it is

19
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.510
now? Call that number are not

20
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.960
default. Levels are huge. What does the disseminator say? 3.6 ranking,

21
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.680
but that's as high as the is 3.60 or terrible. Hey buddy,

22
00:02:09.681 --> 00:02:13.610
what temperature you got? 98.6. Wait a minute. Is this thing broken again?

23
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.230
Our sources get as low as 10 as high as 50. I think the true number is much,

24
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.011
much higher.

25
00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:22.910
It was at that moment that Mark Bob realized the whole world economy might

26
00:02:22.911 --> 00:02:26.450
collapse. What are you doing?

27
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.490
We have to shut all the way down.

28
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.750
Not maybe we should put the city on full alert. We're

29
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.070
going to issue an alert. I don't want to bust up your place,

30
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.540
but you got an issue and alert.

31
00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:41.600
You bring me in to tell me everything's fine and everything's not fine,

32
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.320
but I've been assured there is no problem. I'm telling you that. That is.

33
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.370
I prefer my opinion to yours. Sick. We're not getting sick.

34
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.370
We have far too much planned. Amity is a Summertown.

35
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.970
We need summer dollars. This could destroy the company.

36
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.850
The company cares about the company. What about us?

37
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.640
It's biggest shopping weekend of the year.

38
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.620
I think we need to consider closing schools down. Now,

39
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:04.330
if you fellowship concerned about the beaches,

40
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:06.460
you do whatever you have to to make them safe.

41
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.150
But those beaches will be open for this weekend. And right from the beginning,

42
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:14.980
you knew this was different because it was happening in small villages,

43
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.600
market towns. It's like Chernobyl. Regardless.

44
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:22.840
We have a protocol for scenarios like them isolating everybody.

45
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:26.200
I've already quarantined the boss and med staff, EMS crews, girls, neighbors.

46
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.020
Why am I in here? I'm protection is going to have to go into quarantine.

47
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.950
That's it. So a week. Nothing else I can do. Just wait.

48
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.500
Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for. I'm uh,

49
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.990
I'm outlining a new writing project and five months of pieces.

50
00:03:48.991 --> 00:03:53.610
Just what I want to four weeks. I'm a raid the minibar. Sit back and watch.

51
00:03:53.611 --> 00:03:56.250
My nine is in the super bowl. I'm not your wife and son.

52
00:03:56.251 --> 00:04:00.810
How do you think don't take to it? They'll love it.

53
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.680
My wife is here. Do you think I would keep it in?

54
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.760
Pripyat if it wasn't safe at the time they tried to evacuate the cities.

55
00:04:08.761 --> 00:04:13.020
It was already too late. The infection was everywhere.

56
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:24.683
[inaudible] help yourself.

57
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.410
[inaudible] things going. What's the Taurus

58
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.340
things could be better. Lloyd

59
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.890
things could be a whole lot better. It says here only eight weeks. Well,

60
00:04:46.891 --> 00:04:48.780
that's not long enough for guys to go bunkers. Oh.

61
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.550
Five minutes is enough to put a man over down here. You spend weeks ago,

62
00:04:53.551 --> 00:04:57.360
since we missed our Winslow was supposed to be here for two months.

63
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.290
It's been eight months. I mean, this is like some psychologic experimental talk.

64
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.243
You're saying funny.

65
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.520
And I ain't want him to be stranded here with some domino knitted. I said, ship,

66
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.930
we get the shuttle and just get the hell out of here. I can't take it anymore,

67
00:05:12.931 --> 00:05:16.920
your honor, please much better. And I won't harm anybody.

68
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.140
And you got to let me come back and

69
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.430
put the government. What did they do?

70
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.950
There's no government of course is a government.

71
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.110
[inaudible] you want to hate about banking and reducing people to numbers.

72
00:05:37.111 --> 00:05:40.050
Here's the number. Every 1% unemployment goes up. 40,000 people died.

73
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.170
Did you know that these are not statistics? Ladies and gentlemen,

74
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.360
they're fortune blood. I want you to find those into your memories.

75
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.730
You knew there was a shark out there.

76
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.930
You knew it was dangerous. People could swim. Anyway,

77
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.440
I got people to Dr. Cheever.

78
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.680
We all do my kids.

79
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.540
I don't think I wanted anything who wasn't destroying,

80
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.720
who is changing everything. He was making something new.

81
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.440
She's got a dad and he's his daughter. So I was wrong.

82
00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:41.060
When I said this thing in life is as good as it gets. I think despite

83
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:45.703
this

84
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.900
problem has been assigned and you will stop at nothing

85
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.573
it's working.

86
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:06.170
We either have a high chance of killing one person or low chance of killing six

87
00:07:06.171 --> 00:07:08.690
people. How do we make that? We,

88
00:07:08.691 --> 00:07:13.670
this spring we lose summer is another 144

89
00:07:13.671 --> 00:07:17.060
days. That don't happen again. If we do everything perfectly,

90
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:22.310
we had 533 days to our mission. They'll do it. If it goes,

91
00:07:22.311 --> 00:07:26.300
it must be done. If you don't,

92
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.300
we'll die. If you're telling me that's not enough, I won't believe you,

93
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.610
Charles. What do you think you're doing? Dave and Frank.

94
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:57.710
Why don't we just wait here for a little while?

95
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:02.203
See what happens?

96
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.110
Do you think they're infected

97
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:15.230
just fine.
