00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.170
<v 1>Breaking bad is definitely a landmark in TV history,</v>

2
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.900
to someone who grew up watching the serials of the 1960s.

3
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.740
A show with that level of technical Infomatic complexity would be somewhat

4
00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:19.574
surprising.

5
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.940
There's no doubt that television as an art form has grown and improved over time

6
00:00:22.941 --> 00:00:25.910
through continuous experimentation with the format breaking bad,

7
00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:28.910
didn't come out of nowhere. Vince Gilligan and the writers of breaking bad,

8
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.940
built on the work of the great shows before them to make something that took

9
00:00:31.941 --> 00:00:35.360
full advantage of what makes television unique since its inception,

10
00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:36.380
the rules of television,

11
00:00:36.381 --> 00:00:41.090
forced producers to adapt to the unusual nature of the format. Unlike movies,

12
00:00:41.091 --> 00:00:43.460
TV competed directly with other shows.

13
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.520
Changing your mind was as easy as pressing a button borrowing techniques from

14
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.480
serial and radio TV writers fought for the attention of viewers in a way movies

15
00:00:50.481 --> 00:00:54.560
didn't have to early TV show runners used cliffhangers to ensure viewers kept

16
00:00:54.561 --> 00:00:57.050
coming back to a piece shorter attention spans.

17
00:00:57.051 --> 00:01:00.230
Every show had its own contained episodic narrative structure.

18
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.080
<v 0>Sure. To meet with us again next week at the same time.</v>

19
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.161
<v 1>It's breaking bad.</v>

20
00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:07.970
So groundbreaking in particular is how it took the constraints of the format and

21
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.350
use them to its advantage.

22
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.980
Cliffhangers became an opportunity for the show to reflect groundbreaking

23
00:01:12.981 --> 00:01:16.850
character changes and episodic narrative structure means that the show is rich

24
00:01:16.851 --> 00:01:20.390
with short stories that stick with the viewers and deepen our understanding of

25
00:01:20.391 --> 00:01:21.170
the characters.

26
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.710
Many episodes are self-contained stories that don't directly move the plot

27
00:01:24.711 --> 00:01:25.220
forward,

28
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.270
but give us insight into character dynamics and indirectly raise the stakes for

29
00:01:29.271 --> 00:01:30.170
the show as a whole

30
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.250
Importantly, breaking bad took full advantage of the most important asset.

31
00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:42.020
Television has time while Michael Corleone went from an unassuming idealist to

32
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.540
murderous gangster. It almost seems like his destiny.

33
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.330
He was part of the family after all Walter White, however,

34
00:01:47.331 --> 00:01:48.650
had much further to fall.

35
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.250
The medium of television gave the creators the time necessary for Walt's

36
00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:54.140
dramatic change. By the final season,

37
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.250
longtime fans of the series had spent years of their lives invested in Walter

38
00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:02.360
White's transformation from Mr. Rogers to Scarface the entire series built up so

39
00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:05.720
much tension that the catharsis of finishing the series is virtually

40
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.480
unparalleled in most other popular entertainment.

41
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.290
The point is breaking bad was great because it understood how to use the medium

42
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:15.740
it was written in and the same goes for any other format like the early TV

43
00:02:15.741 --> 00:02:19.670
viewers of the 1950s, we are living in the early years of a new medium,

44
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.640
but instead of the medium of television, ours is the internet though.

45
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.180
Some may not look at the creation of internet content as much of an artistic

46
00:02:26.181 --> 00:02:26.630
endeavor.

47
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.260
Online creators are nonetheless making similar creative decisions about their

48
00:02:30.261 --> 00:02:34.160
cinematography editing and even narrative structure based around the medium.

49
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.100
Some are cleverly harnessing these constraints and using them to their

50
00:02:37.101 --> 00:02:37.934
advantage.

51
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.420
<v 0>By now you have received my message that we will no longer be communicating.</v>

52
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.611
<v 1>Television.</v>

53
00:02:43.611 --> 00:02:47.570
The internet as a medium gave way to a new set of creative challenges for the

54
00:02:47.571 --> 00:02:48.111
first time,

55
00:02:48.111 --> 00:02:52.610
the medium itself gave the consumer the same level of access and distribution as

56
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.880
preferred.

57
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.900
<v 0>National creators.</v>

58
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.050
What he has is an internet connection and a crappy camera from Walmart.

59
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.520
And that should be enough. And I think right, because of technology.

60
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.830
<v 2>For the first time ever, that is enough.</v>

61
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:03.751
<v 1>Internet creators,</v>

62
00:03:03.751 --> 00:03:06.870
don't just compete with each other like television does with other shows,

63
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.760
people producing content on the internet,

64
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.730
also compete with a consumer's own friends and family.

65
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.360
This distinction has shaped the style and format of internet content.

66
00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.830
<v 2>The relationship that young people have with content that they see online,</v>

67
00:03:19.831 --> 00:03:23.700
that they choose to watch versus the content that they see on TV, which is fed.

68
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.040
<v 3>What's up guys, welcome back to do it with clothes on.</v>

69
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.860
<v 1>When you think of video content on the internet,</v>

70
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.590
chances are you think of blocking. And that makes sense.

71
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.170
Blocking is essentially Instagram come to life.

72
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.820
Snappily edited visually engaging videos that show off lavish and over the top

73
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.760
lifestyles though, the format is intentionally informal.

74
00:03:41.761 --> 00:03:45.810
These creators definitely make careful aesthetic and thematic choices to convey

75
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.010
a sense of authenticity. The genre has some obvious and cliche tropes,

76
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.680
handheld cameras talking directly into the screen,

77
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.840
little to no color correction and day in the life.

78
00:03:54.841 --> 00:03:57.030
Storytelling have become creative choices.

79
00:03:57.031 --> 00:04:00.780
These filmmakers use this aesthetic style originated from a place of

80
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.080
technological limitation, but with the cheaper and better technology,

81
00:04:04.081 --> 00:04:06.210
the practical constraints are no longer there.

82
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.870
Flockers like David doebrick have the budget and equipment to shoot their blogs

83
00:04:09.871 --> 00:04:13.650
like a traditional documentary or reality television show, but they don't.

84
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.370
And that's because they know that the vlog format plays to the strengths of the

85
00:04:17.371 --> 00:04:20.670
media on the internet content creators compete with their audiences,

86
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.990
own family and friends.

87
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.380
They keep the authenticity and the lack of Polish to make their content fit in.

88
00:04:25.381 --> 00:04:28.440
Well, amongst the Instagram stories of the family and friends,

89
00:04:28.441 --> 00:04:32.520
you actually know Dover is a great example of someone who has really captured

90
00:04:32.521 --> 00:04:36.450
the style. His blogs are flashily edited and focus on a lavish lifestyle,

91
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.350
but at the end of the day,

92
00:04:37.351 --> 00:04:40.350
they rely on the authenticity of a group of friends having fun.

93
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.280
His episodes feature a wide ranging cast of characters each with a particular

94
00:04:44.281 --> 00:04:48.420
brand. Domus a player. Jason is old and Josh is a washed up actor.

95
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.320
This semi scripted format combined with the authentic feeling vlog aesthetic

96
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.600
blurs the line between staged moments and re.

97
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.430
<v 3>Clickbait clickbait. My God quick, get a thumbnail.</v>

98
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.650
<v 1>No matter how ridiculous the scenario,</v>

99
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.460
Dover has a real knack for making content that feels like a day spent hanging

100
00:05:05.461 --> 00:05:06.330
out with your friends.

101
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.860
So it's no surprise that he's so popular on a medium that values social networks

102
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.770
blocks like these are successful. Not just because they feel real,

103
00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:16.200
but because they are hyper real, his flocks channel,

104
00:05:16.201 --> 00:05:20.160
the innate desire people have on the internet to edit and craft their own online

105
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.900
image to mimic the seemingly fun and carefree life of doebrick and his friends.

106
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:25.111
Yet,

107
00:05:25.111 --> 00:05:29.040
it's always crucial that these blogs don't feel too produced and amateur quality

108
00:05:29.041 --> 00:05:31.470
maintains that authentic informal feel.

109
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.350
And this informality does not just exist in flogging.

110
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.380
It's also popular in other genres of internet content.

111
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.510
<v 3>I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay. Listen,</v>

112
00:05:39.511 --> 00:05:43.380
this is what we want to give you an opportunity to communicate.

113
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.220
<v 1>A great example of a format that could only succeed on the internet is the long</v>

114
00:05:47.221 --> 00:05:48.690
form interview podcast.

115
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.380
While this interview format definitely borrows from traditional radio shows like

116
00:05:52.381 --> 00:05:54.660
the Joe Rogan experience capitalize on the,

117
00:05:54.661 --> 00:05:58.670
at your own pace nature of the internet to a topic more fully.

118
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.410
<v 4>You can see in maybe like an interview that isn't great that like that person</v>

119
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:06.260
doing the interview is just leaving a lot of change on the table.

120
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.210
Like maybe they'll like ask something,

121
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:10.640
but because they're just thinking about the next question. And because like,

122
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:11.840
this is just some sort of formula,

123
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:13.400
like they're not really looking at the guests.

124
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.350
<v 5>Thanks Hawaiian. We have to talk about this pineapple jumper.</v>

125
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.650
<v 4>Suit and what we do. Wow.</v>

126
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.120
<v 1>Broken and other podcast hosts present their interviews,</v>

127
00:06:25.121 --> 00:06:27.970
not as formalized interviews, but as conversations.

128
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.630
The advantage of this style is that guests relax and often say and do things

129
00:06:31.631 --> 00:06:32.950
they wouldn't normally do.

130
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.610
<v 5>I think when I was, I don't know, five or six or something,</v>

131
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:37.870
I thought I was insane.

132
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.610
<v 1>Ideas get flushed out and we get a seemingly more honest to look at the</v>

133
00:06:42.611 --> 00:06:45.100
interviewee. It's nothing like the traditional talk show.

134
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.060
<v 4>You can kind of see,</v>

135
00:06:46.061 --> 00:06:50.310
like maybe they kind of wanted that topic to be explored a little bit deeper.

136
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.800
<v 1>But it's important to remember that this style is still an interview tactic</v>

137
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.840
while it seems unproduced and unpolished.

138
00:06:55.841 --> 00:07:00.040
It's no doubt a conscious decision on Rogan's part to elicit a specific reaction

139
00:07:00.041 --> 00:07:01.060
out of his guests.

140
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.380
This informality authenticity and on-demand availability makes these shows

141
00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:06.880
perfectly suited for the internet.

142
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:10.840
Their success makes sense on a medium where people expect transparency and love

143
00:07:10.841 --> 00:07:14.890
discussion self-expression and personality thrive in the podcast format and on

144
00:07:14.891 --> 00:07:16.030
the internet in general,

145
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.330
people on the internet simultaneously play a character and to act like

146
00:07:19.331 --> 00:07:20.164
themselves.

147
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.760
These podcasts further blur that line while vlogs capitalize on the image making

148
00:07:24.761 --> 00:07:27.040
of the internet and podcasts capitalize on.

149
00:07:27.041 --> 00:07:31.510
Self-expression a third genre capitalizes on another equally important part of

150
00:07:31.511 --> 00:07:32.344
the internet.

151
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.530
<v 5>Hey, everybody. Welcome back to another episode of Kickstarter cramp. Hey,</v>

152
00:07:35.531 --> 00:07:38.890
little stinkers, and welcome back to youtube.com. What's up Greg.

153
00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:41.080
Welcome back to my channel here. Beautiful bastion.

154
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.710
They'll be on a fantastic Tuesday. Welcome back to the Philip de Franco show.

155
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:45.220
Commentary.

156
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.340
<v 1>Channels are another genre, unique to YouTube and to internet content,</v>

157
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.650
whether they're political, humorous or dramatic,

158
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.170
they all take advantage of the medium in a similar way.

159
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.890
Like floggers commentary channels speak directly to the camera as a way to

160
00:07:56.891 --> 00:07:59.980
incorporate their viewer into the broader conversation channels.

161
00:07:59.981 --> 00:08:02.200
Like I dubs H three H three, drew Gooden,

162
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:05.890
and many others engage in pre-existing discussion about news or internet

163
00:08:05.891 --> 00:08:08.980
content. If a podcast is like a social media post and flogs,

164
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:12.670
or like somebody's profile, then commentary channels are the comments. Section.

165
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.790
These channels constantly respond to each other, highlighting content.

166
00:08:15.791 --> 00:08:19.840
They find problematic and engaging in a level of meta commentary that often

167
00:08:19.841 --> 00:08:22.630
requires a lot of existing knowledge on the topic.

168
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.040
It makes sense that content responsive to audience discussion became so popular

169
00:08:27.041 --> 00:08:30.550
on the internet. Television shows on NBC. Don't have a comment section,

170
00:08:30.551 --> 00:08:34.030
but internet content creators are constantly bombarded with comments and

171
00:08:34.031 --> 00:08:34.720
opinions.

172
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.530
<v 6>Today. Guys,</v>

173
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:39.850
I am reacting to perhaps the most requested video of all time.

174
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:44.020
<v 1>As a result, creators often take that feedback and change their discussions.</v>

175
00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:47.860
The highly discursive nature of the internet has allowed content creators to

176
00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:52.000
enhance their content by being a part of the feedback loop smart creators,

177
00:08:52.001 --> 00:08:55.590
use this feedback loop to incorporate their audience into their content,

178
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.020
giving them an almost personal stake in the story.

179
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:02.280
They'll flogging podcasts and commentary channels all vary drastically in style.

180
00:09:02.281 --> 00:09:05.310
They all understand the constraints of the internet and leverage those

181
00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:08.010
constraints to tell a more thematic and engaging story.

182
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.280
So what does the future hold for internet content who is telling a story that

183
00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:13.410
pushes the boundaries of what the internet can do?

184
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.040
What will be the breaking bad of the internet? Of course only time will tell,

185
00:09:17.041 --> 00:09:20.580
but I think there is one creator who takes advantage of all the strengths of

186
00:09:20.581 --> 00:09:21.414
internet content.

187
00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:24.890
<v 7>Shane Dawson.</v>

188
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.270
<v 8>Industry news. We should talk about Shane Dawson. Shane.</v>

189
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.100
<v 1>Dawson is the King of YouTube.</v>

190
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.750
<v 7>Shane Dawson, Shane Bolson.</v>

191
00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:37.100
Shane Dawson is doing a documentary on Logan Paul's brother, Jake Paul.

192
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:42.140
<v 1>Okay. In the past year,</v>

193
00:09:42.141 --> 00:09:45.980
Shane Dawson has definitely challenged our assumptions of what internet content

194
00:09:45.981 --> 00:09:49.400
can be. These whole documentary and series have just been over the,

195
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.473
over the top.

196
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:54.020
<v 8>Amazing to see that this has become kind of a site-wide event.</v>

197
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:56.270
<v 7>It's the mind of Jake Paul, like all of it,</v>

198
00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.540
which is weird because YouTube drama, not a big part of my life,

199
00:09:59.541 --> 00:10:01.940
but I was interested in this because it looks like we're living in a time where

200
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.100
the entertainment of YouTube starting to become more, less.

201
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.940
<v 1>Shane's long form documentaries on controversial YouTubers and conspiracy</v>

202
00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:12.230
theories get as many views as primetime television shows in a space that's so

203
00:10:12.231 --> 00:10:15.380
diverse and fragmented. The videos seem to unify the commission.

204
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.650
<v 8>But as of recording this video, it's at 7.8 million views.</v>

205
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.210
It's such a big site-wide event.

206
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.480
We usually see a drop in the number of people watching our video during the

207
00:10:23.481 --> 00:10:27.080
first two to three hours of release of a Shane Dawson video.

208
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:30.890
<v 1>These videos, Shane Dawson, borrows, the techniques of commentary channels,</v>

209
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:35.480
law informed podcasts, and the flock to tell his story like commentary channels.

210
00:10:35.481 --> 00:10:39.680
Shane saw the cultural relevance of this topic and seized the opportunity by

211
00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:42.290
entering something ongoing and incredibly popular.

212
00:10:42.291 --> 00:10:45.380
The docu-series was thrust to the forefront of internet culture.

213
00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.440
Not only did he enter and provide his own take on the discussion,

214
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:52.640
he went to the source himself creating perhaps the most complete and valuable

215
00:10:52.641 --> 00:10:53.960
entry into the discussion.

216
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:58.250
Shane actively participated and even edited later episodes to respond to

217
00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.930
up-to-date criticism because Shane is not just releasing a finished eight part

218
00:11:02.931 --> 00:11:06.350
series, he's editing it and adapting it in real time.

219
00:11:06.351 --> 00:11:10.190
Based on the response from the community and the community is responding to his

220
00:11:10.191 --> 00:11:13.250
response. And it's a self-fulfilling cycle that never ends.

221
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.880
This technique invested the viewer in the production of these videos and this

222
00:11:16.881 --> 00:11:19.820
participatory storytelling suits the internet perfectly.

223
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:21.980
Then in another bowl decision on Shane's part,

224
00:11:21.981 --> 00:11:26.330
he decided to make the series extremely long form an eight part series totalling

225
00:11:26.331 --> 00:11:30.530
about seven hours of content on a platform known for short snappy videos.

226
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.650
This change gave him the time to delve into the matter thoroughly.

227
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.400
The informal one camera's set up coupled with the fact that he kept roughly one

228
00:11:37.401 --> 00:11:38.630
interview per episode,

229
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:42.860
kept his interviewees relaxed much like how people feel on the Joe Rogan

230
00:11:42.861 --> 00:11:46.430
experience while his conversations were no doubt edited. The internet,

231
00:11:46.431 --> 00:11:50.240
allowed him to slow down the conversation and have a full picture of the

232
00:11:50.241 --> 00:11:54.100
situation, providing many different perspectives. Finally, most importantly,

233
00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:58.120
he intentionally filmed using vlog aesthetics and editing that capture the

234
00:11:58.121 --> 00:12:00.490
advantages of the medium. By speaking at the viewer,

235
00:12:00.491 --> 00:12:04.180
Shane engages the YouTube community in a very YouTube specific way.

236
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:07.360
It seems only fitting to investigate Paul using Paul's own.

237
00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:09.930
<v 0>Format. Yeah, cause I'm normally the one with the camera.</v>

238
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.290
<v 1>The blog aesthetic gave that same friendly feel.</v>

239
00:12:13.291 --> 00:12:17.100
We get from internet creators like David doebrick, the format stays the same,

240
00:12:17.101 --> 00:12:20.700
but their lives get stripped of much of the glamour. Silence is not cut out.

241
00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:24.000
The camera is less frantic and the subject matter is much heavier.

242
00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.620
Shane picks apart that seemingly authentic flocking style of David doebrick and

243
00:12:28.621 --> 00:12:32.880
Jake Paul, and exposes how scripted and stale those lifestyles can actually.

244
00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:38.310
<v 0>Pretty much everyone that's a little bit older knows</v>

245
00:12:38.311 --> 00:12:39.450
that it's all fake.

246
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.890
<v 1>In doing so. He ironically creates something even more authentic, a story,</v>

247
00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.480
even more suited for the internet.

248
00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:49.350
The reason the series had so much authority and worked so well was because Shane

249
00:12:49.351 --> 00:12:53.100
produced it so authentically at its core, it was about understanding a person.

250
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:56.190
And what better way to do that then as friends hanging out and having fun

251
00:12:56.191 --> 00:12:58.800
together, Shane series might be the first of its kind.

252
00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:02.490
I certainly can't think of a vlog series. That's not only so widely popular,

253
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.310
but both this level of technical and thematic complexity,

254
00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:09.120
Shane Dawson has done so well on YouTube because he understands the stories,

255
00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:12.150
the internet thrives on and the techniques necessary to tell them.

256
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.060
So maybe you're looking at something like Shane's flog through the lens of the

257
00:13:15.061 --> 00:13:19.200
medium explains why this series was so popular when it came out and maybe like

258
00:13:19.201 --> 00:13:20.430
the writers of breaking bad.

259
00:13:20.431 --> 00:13:23.550
Shane captured how to use his medium to craft a message,

260
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:27.600
or maybe the format of internet entertainment still has a long, long way to go.

261
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:30.570
And people are going to get sick of some guy online telling you what to think,

262
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:31.440
but I sure.

263
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.273
<v 0>Hope not.</v>

264
00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.560
<v 1>One of the many benefits of the medium of the internet is its accessibility.</v>

265
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:41.370
The drawback is that it's almost as easy to make low quality content on the

266
00:13:41.371 --> 00:13:44.640
internet as it is to consume it. When it comes to something like video editing.

267
00:13:44.641 --> 00:13:48.480
I don't want to waste time trying to decide what content is worth learning from.

268
00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:50.550
If I'm going to learn a new editing software,

269
00:13:50.551 --> 00:13:55.050
I would enroll in a high quality and efficient editing tutorial online like the

270
00:13:55.051 --> 00:13:59.310
Adobe premier beginner's course on Skillshare Skillshare has over 20,000 high

271
00:13:59.311 --> 00:14:03.330
quality classes on many topics ranging from editing to creative writing.

276

<v 0>Yeah.</v>
