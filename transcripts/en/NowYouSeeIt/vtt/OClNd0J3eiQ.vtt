00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.170
<v 0>As you know, Marty said that a lot of the thought is you stay all theme park,</v>

2
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:05.423
ride, Marty, what are you doing?

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.730
Your iron man portrayal has become the thing. It is a huge moneymaker. Yeah.

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.800
You still enjoy doing it. Yes, it is.

5
00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:18.600
This very large multi-headed Hydra at this point, according to Scorsese,

6
00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:21.810
it's not cinema. I got to take a look at that, but it is cinema, isn't it?

7
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.030
I mean, it plays in theaters like saying, you know, bug money. Ain't funny.

8
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.070
You know, I think in his view, we're, uh,

9
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.670
denigrated the, the, the art, the era,

10
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.780
the art form of cinema going to the movies used to be an experience.

11
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.610
People will go see movies just because they said is going to be

12
00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:46.430
number one, the value. How do you,

13
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.570
I don't want to say the value of a film. That's like a theme park film,

14
00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:53.570
for example, and the Marvel type pictures. Cause not cinema,

15
00:00:53.571 --> 00:00:54.500
it's something else.

16
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.860
And we need the theater owners to step up for that to allow theaters,

17
00:00:57.861 --> 00:01:00.920
to show films that are narrative films.

18
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.130
<v 1>He got a lot of heat for it, but I understand fully what you were saying.</v>

19
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.600
They always felt cut from the same cloth in that they were very big and

20
00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:12.770
event and CGI spectacles. To some extent I was thinking at the time,

21
00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:15.530
what would it be like to really strip it all down and do,

22
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.540
and do a really intimate character study or you explore one of these characters

23
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.740
in an intense way.

24
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.610
<v 0>Was inspired by your sin. I know by your movies,</v>

25
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.240
but do you also consider it as a theme park movie? I don't know about that.

26
00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:34.100
I know the film very well and I know Todd very well. Mike producer, Dylan,

27
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.300
Schakowsky produced it. So, um, it's an interesting question.

28
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.980
No, one's laughing. We're not laughing at the clamps.

29
00:01:47.981 --> 00:01:51.620
I don't want to be down on the clowns. We are colleagues in a certain sense,

30
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.630
comedians and clown, comedians and clowns,

31
00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:56.870
but we all know somewhere underneath all of that bright color,

32
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.820
there is a man who's not right. At some point, he's got to wash his face,

33
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.890
taking his pants and start dealing with life. Like

34
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.920
let us go to Matt and say hello to the very talented Joaquin Phoenix.

35
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.080
[inaudible] thank you very much for being on the program. Again, you know,

36
00:02:24.081 --> 00:02:27.470
it's been three years since the last time you were on the show and I will just

37
00:02:27.471 --> 00:02:29.990
say right off the top, here you look different than I remember.

38
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.080
This is exactly how I imagined it. Well,

39
00:02:36.081 --> 00:02:36.950
that makes one of us.

40
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.220
We've got a nice beard going and Oh yeah. I was at the beard

41
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.130
[inaudible] I watched that whole interview. And I said to myself, well, Kane,

42
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.350
Phoenix is a genius.

43
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.650
That was like the greatest press parents I've ever seen in my life were terrific

44
00:02:54.651 --> 00:02:56.990
in the film. I really enjoyed your work. Thank you.

45
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.640
This is how brilliant it is.

46
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.260
Basically what he's doing is resisting every protocol of what it's like to be on

47
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:08.050
a late night talk shows you and a piece of cardboard in your room.

48
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:09.810
<v 2>I'm making fun of it, but.</v>

49
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.600
<v 0>And then do any of the banter. He didn't do any of that. Hey, good to be here.</v>

50
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.920
David got a new movie coming up. Can we move on? Yes.

51
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.260
And he's a completely different kind of celebrity than I am by design of what he

52
00:03:25.261 --> 00:03:26.820
does. He's a fine actor.

53
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.860
<v 3>You have a tendency to make things up.</v>

54
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.300
You lie on talk shows every time I've ever seen you.

55
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.770
<v 0>When you see walking in Kleenex,</v>

56
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.930
he's in a movie pretending to be somebody completely different and he's

57
00:03:39.931 --> 00:03:42.630
very good at it. So you can't tell what he's actually like.

58
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.360
<v 3>Bad news for Marvel fans looking to see what keen Phoenix in the role of Dr.</v>

59
00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:53.070
Strange as word is the actor has dropped out of talks with the comic book diet.

60
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.630
<v 4>The 43 year old actor was reportedly the first choice to replace that Horton as</v>

61
00:03:57.631 --> 00:03:59.820
the Hulk, but passed on the opportunity.

62
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.460
<v 3>You've said in the past that you would do a comic book movie,</v>

63
00:04:02.461 --> 00:04:03.690
if the right role came up.

64
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.820
<v 1>Why was this the right role for you?</v>

65
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.250
<v 2>Can you just say it was complex in a way that the other movies</v>

66
00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:13.020
that I kind of flirted with?

67
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.940
Weren't probably why I ultimately said yes to the movies because I wasn't

68
00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:22.320
sure of what I felt about him. I liked that space. Um, um, I'm,

69
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.090
I'm comfortable there. I don't need all the answers. It just seemed to me,

70
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.010
no matter what the character is, it just sort of,

71
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.250
you're going along the journey with that character. You may like the character.

72
00:04:32.251 --> 00:04:35.460
You may not, but it's just that you're interested in the character.

73
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.490
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

74
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.500
<v 4>Movie and what Todd Phillips is doing.</v>

75
00:04:43.501 --> 00:04:47.760
And it as a director and how it's being written is so

76
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.750
Scorsese at times, it's it has so much taxi driver.

77
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.540
You got some bad ideas in my head. I just hold on.

78
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.120
<v 2>Have negative thoughts.</v>

79
00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.400
<v 4>And so much King of comedy in it. This is how I see you.</v>

80
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.080
<v 1>You could say something like this, one small thing. Yeah.</v>

81
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.530
<v 2>Bring me out. Can you introduce me as joker? At that time,</v>

82
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.580
there were so many films and we wonder wonderful actors between these characters

83
00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:18.720
where we didn't really know fully understand what their motivation was.

84
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.520
And we were okay with that.

85
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.790
<v 1>It was always to give off this kind of unsettling vibe of this guy who was</v>

86
00:05:26.791 --> 00:05:30.390
pretty much separated from everybody else. Even in this locker room,

87
00:05:30.391 --> 00:05:33.540
space alone, kind of, not part of the group.

88
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.830
<v 2>I always tried to shoot Bob a single frame on his shot. However,</v>

89
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.990
when you take other people, we try to shoot, pass him,

90
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.130
include him in their frames. We try to keep him separate from everybody else.

91
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.280
<v 1>Larry and I really chose to shoot a ton of this really long lens.</v>

92
00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:50.460
So you have that real shallow depth of field that you see in some of those old

93
00:05:50.461 --> 00:05:52.380
school movies did them. The 600.

94
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.810
<v 2>The longest lens I tried to do was really isolate him.</v>

95
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.130
I tried to isolate him from other people, but he him completely.

96
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.110
<v 1>Soft focused. And he's kind of floating through the city.</v>

97
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.200
When you make a movie about one person of the other element becomes a

98
00:06:05.201 --> 00:06:05.741
character.

99
00:06:05.741 --> 00:06:10.270
If the music is suddenly a character and the locations are suddenly character

100
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.290
shoot this scene against Columbus circle. So we'd see the life we see the city.

101
00:06:14.291 --> 00:06:16.330
The city is like really a character in this movie too. You know,

102
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.470
we wanted this movie to feel like it could have come out in the summer of 1979.

103
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.110
I'm doing the commentary here. Now I see this. And it's a pretty,

104
00:06:23.111 --> 00:06:25.750
pretty close sense of New York in the late seventies. You know,

105
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.910
You know that scene where he's dancing in the bathroom is scripted as an

106
00:06:39.911 --> 00:06:41.590
entirely different scene. Good.

107
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.020
I believe had a saying that he was preparing in front of the mirror and I was

108
00:06:44.021 --> 00:06:46.240
saying to him, I really think we need for you to speak in the mirror,

109
00:06:46.241 --> 00:06:47.350
speak to yourself in the mirror. Yeah.

110
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.190
He goes into this little rundown bathroom in a rundown park and he is going to

111
00:06:51.191 --> 00:06:55.000
wash his makeup off and hide the gun under a thing. And when meanwhile came,

112
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.860
we're on the set and we're just like, man,

113
00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.130
this doesn't really feel like the Arthur we've been filming now for four or five

114
00:07:00.131 --> 00:07:02.890
weeks. Not him. It was the last week of shooting.

115
00:07:02.891 --> 00:07:07.870
We over-schedule five days in America. It was very difficult. And we said, okay,

116
00:07:07.871 --> 00:07:10.360
we're just going to shoot this scene and uh, locked the door.

117
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.130
So our assistant director wouldn't get it.

118
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.700
And so we sat around for 45 minutes while you know, the crews outside,

119
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.150
just thinking about other possibility Ady was banging on the door, come on,

120
00:07:19.151 --> 00:07:21.610
we gotta get out of here. And I said, let's, she's good. This is good.

121
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.740
Just wait, give me another minute. I called the operator.

122
00:07:23.741 --> 00:07:26.320
Didn't even tell the operator what we're doing. I just said, start on his foot.

123
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:29.110
Yeah, that was sort of at his feet in front of the mirror,

124
00:07:29.111 --> 00:07:32.290
right in front of him. And he started improvising it and he kept saying,

125
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.920
are you talking to me? And just started playing the score from off of my iPhone.

126
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.390
And he started doing this dance, then that was it. Um, but he just kept,

127
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.413
he went on a roll. Yeah.

128
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.240
<v 2>You talking to me talking to me.</v>

129
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.860
<v 1>Go ahead and produce this film. Your, your partner, Emma, is the producer on it.</v>

130
00:07:53.861 --> 00:07:56.470
Why did you decide not to, uh, personal reasons?

131
00:07:56.471 --> 00:08:00.790
I think for me also scheduling and primary, I mean, quite honestly,

132
00:08:00.791 --> 00:08:03.880
a taxi driver and King of comedy and lasting patient of Christ.

133
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.090
Those were my fights. You've got to start.

134
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:06.820
<v 2>The bottom.</v>

135
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.750
I know that's where I am at the bottom because comedy is a very weird film,

136
00:08:10.751 --> 00:08:12.640
but it has a lot in common with a taxi driver.

137
00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:17.260
Both are stories about outsiders who want to be insiders. Hi Eliza.

138
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:22.900
Let's see Gerald. Good to see Jerry. Don't get up. Hey Mary,

139
00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:27.640
thank you so much for having me on the show. It's been a lifetime view of mine.

140
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:30.183
Yeah.

141
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:44.200
Joker has a certain kind of arrogance and this needs to be

142
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.450
revered and adored. He sees himself as, as a King in some way,

143
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.560
or looking at the King of comedy. This was not a pleasant guy.

144
00:08:53.561 --> 00:08:55.830
And the question is, I think filmmakers, filmmaker.

145
00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:59.610
<v 3>Say, you have to like your characters. I don't think Scorsese likes this.</v>

146
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.310
You don't give a about people like you are there.

147
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:04.860
And they really don't give a about people like that.

148
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:08.900
<v 2>Me, I think I had such mixed feelings about the character as I,</v>

149
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.820
as I went through the script and everybody that I included in my family have a

150
00:09:13.821 --> 00:09:15.860
different reaction to the character,

151
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.950
into the movie and what it means and how it,

152
00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:20.600
whether they should sympathize or not.

153
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.560
I think it's that I look at my whole life and I see the awful,

154
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:28.490
terrible things in my life and turn it into something funny.

155
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.040
I used to think that my life was a tragedy,

156
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.990
but now I realize it's a comedy.

157
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:39.170
And that's what I like about the movie. Right? It's not that ACTIC,

158
00:09:39.171 --> 00:09:42.620
it's not telling you precisely what you should feel a win.

159
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.950
And I think that's rare in movies.

160
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:05.743
[inaudible]

161
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.850
you said decent [inaudible].

162
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:12.230
<v 3>Oh, Jesus.</v>

163
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:19.550
[inaudible]. I don't know. I mean, I know when I see it to see

164
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:19.550
 it, I know. I don't know. You know, when there's an officer there and you know, when it's personal and you know, 

165
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:19.550
anything

166
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:20.383
, you can feel it, you can feel it come through every moment, every shot every and the actors and every piece of it and it, and it just doesn't miss you. And I don't know that I can explain it better than that.

167
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:40.911
<v 1>I'm walking in.</v>

168
00:10:40.911 --> 00:10:44.930
I spend six months talking about the movie before we shot the first frame of the

169
00:10:44.931 --> 00:10:45.231
movie.

170
00:10:45.231 --> 00:10:50.000
So all we did was collaborate and talk about ways to do scenes approaches to the

171
00:10:50.001 --> 00:10:54.170
character tone. Talk about telling him how the movie is going to look.

172
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.170
<v 5>When you guys sit down.</v>

173
00:10:57.171 --> 00:10:59.240
And when you first receive a script for one of these things,

174
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:04.760
do they consult with you? Do they discuss this with you? I think the phrase,

175
00:11:04.761 --> 00:11:09.740
the legal phrase for actors and studios is meaningful consultation. Uh,

176
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:10.820
not script approval.

177
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.400
<v 2>That'd review dailies, and I'd go through the script.</v>

178
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.200
So I would just have like still have questions.

179
00:11:15.201 --> 00:11:19.130
And so I would call him for two hours. We would talk like almost every day.

180
00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:24.230
<v 5>Getting a pretty brutal education on what kind of process these</v>

181
00:11:24.231 --> 00:11:25.250
movies require.

182
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.420
You just start trusting more that they're thinking on your behalf.

183
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:34.550
<v 1>It was exciting to me to see no matter how detailed and how</v>

184
00:11:34.551 --> 00:11:38.690
well we wrote a script for him to come in and make it his own.

185
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:42.710
That is literally what people mean. I think when they say the magic of movies,

186
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.070
that's the magic part. Occasionally in art,

187
00:11:46.071 --> 00:11:49.400
you get lucky and you're at the right place at the right time with the right

188
00:11:49.401 --> 00:11:53.860
people. And I think that was the case with taxi driver. This something that.

189
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:58.900
<v 6>Schrader and Scorsese are learning from the French new wave from people like</v>

190
00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:03.010
John Lucco, Dawn and Francois Truffaut, and other filmmakers that were very,

191
00:12:03.011 --> 00:12:05.080
very powerful influences at the time.

192
00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:09.870
<v 7>There was greatly inspired by the works of Martin Scorsese and Sydney lament,</v>

193
00:12:09.871 --> 00:12:13.260
and other filmmakers that I sort of grew up worshiping in the seventies and

194
00:12:13.261 --> 00:12:14.094
early eighties.

195
00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:18.510
<v 6>Every film that you make is a celebration of filmmaking.</v>

196
00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:23.850
And part of that celebration is to allude to them, to give a nod.

197
00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:27.953
<v 7>[Inaudible].</v>

198
00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:35.490
<v 8>Joker taxi driver and King of comedy all had clear directorial, visions,</v>

199
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.180
complete creative control, and just strong actor, director collaboration.

200
00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:41.010
Those ingredients made those movies great.

201
00:12:41.011 --> 00:12:44.280
And the ingredients don't require a big budget or fancy equipment.

202
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:46.320
If you have a vision and want to make your own film,

203
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.740
you have all you need to get started and to help make that vision come to life,

204
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.230
you can join Ryan booze class on making your own videos.

205
00:12:52.231 --> 00:12:53.790
