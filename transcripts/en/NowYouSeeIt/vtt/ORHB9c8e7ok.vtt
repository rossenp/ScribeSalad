00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.020
<v 1>In 2001 was important film for me because I didn't understand it. When I thought</v>

2
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.680
Our dad had taken me.

3
00:00:18.681 --> 00:00:22.160
And I was so frustrated by the movie and kind of hated the movie.

4
00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:26.030
When I first thought it was a good, what is it? Stupid blood.

5
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.863
<v 0>Thing.</v>

6
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.400
<v 1>Stupid. And I was like, I didn't get the, but it was a black thing. And he said,</v>

7
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.400
Oh, that's a symbol. And I kind of like knew what the word was,

8
00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:40.790
but then suddenly I had a visual understanding of what the word was.

9
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.560
It's like a symbol of what? And he said, Oh,

10
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.410
it's kind of like a similar for the consciousness of God.

11
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.580
I didn't even understand what that meant, but it sounded amazing.

12
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.650
And so then I asked him to take me back to see it again. And I thought again,

13
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.470
and then whenever I saw the symbol, I thought of like, God,

14
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.050
and it made more sense to me.

15
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.810
And this was like a strange phenomenon that you could suddenly look at something

16
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.490
and then have different eyes and see it again and understand it in a

17
00:01:10.491 --> 00:01:11.540
completely different way.

18
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.960
<v 0>The answer is out there looking for you.</v>

19
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.360
<v 2>Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something,</v>

20
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.900
what do you know? You can't explain, but you feel it.

21
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.930
You felt it your entire life. You don't know what it is, but it's there. It is.

22
00:01:32.931 --> 00:01:34.490
This feeling that has brought you to me.

23
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.060
Do you know what I'm talking about?

24
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.270
<v 0>They'll make her a Lily white Koski of formerly known as Andy came out publicly</v>

25
00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:48.200
as transgender on Tuesday, something her sister and creative partner,

26
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.420
Lana did a years before theirs.

27
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.830
<v 1>Being cast back on. As in my work, through the lens of our transmits,</v>

28
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.870
it seems that you've been living.

29
00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.850
<v 2>Two lives.</v>

30
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.410
<v 1>I finally came out to my family. When I told my mom what was going on,</v>

31
00:02:03.411 --> 00:02:07.640
she jumped on a plane immediately. There was this big tear,

32
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.820
soaked baptism, and she confessed that.

33
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.560
She'd been afraid to come here to arrive and grieve the loss of her

34
00:02:15.561 --> 00:02:20.540
son far from it. But when she arrived,

35
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.060
she found it wasn't so much as a death, as it was a discovery, just thought,

36
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.163
um.

37
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.070
<v 2>You were a guy. Most guys do.</v>

38
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.430
<v 1>That. There was this other part of me and unseen part.</v>

39
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.850
She felt it was like a gift because now she could get to know.

40
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.410
<v 2>No that part of one of these lives has a future.</v>

41
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.860
<v 1>A mirror boy mirrors can be tough for all of us,</v>

42
00:02:48.861 --> 00:02:51.380
but trans people can be.

43
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.870
<v 2>Like everyone else. You were born into,</v>

44
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.500
born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch a

45
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:01.290
prison for you.

46
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.480
<v 1>I kept this strange relentless vigil staring in the mirror for</v>

47
00:03:06.481 --> 00:03:11.460
hours afraid of what one day I might see. You have to see it for yourself.

48
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.480
The enduring power of the Cinderella myth is this catharsis,

49
00:03:15.481 --> 00:03:19.500
this fitting of a slipper representing this intersection of who we see in the

50
00:03:19.501 --> 00:03:21.630
looking glass with who we want to be.

51
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.990
<v 2>Your appearance now is what we call residual. Self-image.</v>

52
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.590
It is the mental projection of your digital self.

53
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.530
I'm going to show them a world without you,

54
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.050
a world without rules and controls without borders or boundaries, a world.

55
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.300
Anything is possible.

56
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.360
<v 1>Here. One checked box,</v>

57
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.440
one letter and M granted me access to legal,

58
00:03:46.441 --> 00:03:50.160
social financial privilege while another box, another letter,

59
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.110
and AF denied them to me early on. I am told to get in line after a morning,

60
00:03:55.111 --> 00:03:57.300
bell girls in one line boys and the other.

61
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.480
I walked past the girls feeling this strange,

62
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.540
powerful gravity of association.

63
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.640
As soon as I look towards the other line though,

64
00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:09.450
I feel a feeling of differentiation that confuses me.

65
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.750
I don't belong there either. I stop in between them.

66
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.530
<v 2>Where we go from there. It's a choice. I leave to you.</v>

67
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.630
<v 1>When I see the headlight, I take off my backpack and I put it on the bench.</v>

68
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.190
As the note in front of it,

69
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.510
I try not to think of anything but jumping as the train comes.

70
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.600
<v 2>Your death. Goodbye, Mr. Henderson.</v>

71
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.831
<v 1>We went to dinner.</v>

72
00:04:40.831 --> 00:04:45.480
I dressed as feminine as I could wanting to be seen by strangers as Lana hoping

73
00:04:45.481 --> 00:04:47.100
our waiters were not coming, sir, or.

74
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:54.490
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

75
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.290
<v 1>I am Lynn. This is my daughter, Lana, the waitress smile and said, wow.</v>

76
00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.460
She looks just like you.

77
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.023
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

78
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.100
<v 1>Of all the things I love about my hair</v>

79
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.060
high on the list is the way children stare at it with fascination

80
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.990
and delight.

81
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.550
I can sometimes see their imagination bright in their eyes,

82
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.920
recalibrating the possible.

83
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.110
It is my hope that a symbol like pink dreads might help them

84
00:05:37.111 --> 00:05:38.100
understand.

85
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.330
Normal is something that does not have to be defined for you,

86
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.810
but rather by you. I am here because when I was young,

87
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.490
I wanted very badly to be a writer. I wanted to be a filmmaker,

88
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.490
but I couldn't find anyone liked me in the world.

89
00:05:53.491 --> 00:05:56.280
And it felt that my dreams were for closed.

90
00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.800
Simply my gender was less typical than others.

91
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.760
<v 3>It's an excellent reminder that art is never static.</v>

92
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.020
And while the ideas of identity and transformation are critical components in

93
00:06:08.021 --> 00:06:11.680
our work, the bedrock that all ideas rest upon his love.

94
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.490
<v 1>I know I am also here because of the strength and courage and love that I am</v>

95
00:06:24.491 --> 00:06:28.870
blessed to receive from my wife, my family, and my friends. And in this way,

96
00:06:28.871 --> 00:06:32.680
I hope to offer their love in the form of mind materiality.

97
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.590
So this world that we imagine in this room,

98
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.360
it might be used to gain access to other rooms, to other worlds.

99
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.223
Previously.

100
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.630
<v 2>He told me I wasn't really looking for him. I was looking for an answer.</v>

101
00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.180
It's the question that drives us.

102
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.870
You know, the question just doesn't.
