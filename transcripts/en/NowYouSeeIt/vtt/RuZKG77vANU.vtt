00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.170
<v 0>Which is why the matrix was redesigned to this</v>

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.580
peak of your civilization.

3
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.170
<v 1>In 1989, the cold war ended in 2001. The twin towers fell,</v>

4
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.770
but in between was an era of relative stability for America. The economy,

5
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.750
soared politicians, balanced the budget,

6
00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:34.610
and the president played sax on our Cineo.

7
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.760
Even the Simpson saw the stability happening during the 1990s.

8
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.940
<v 0>What's wrong with this guy, Andre and a man walked down the street,</v>

9
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.350
but I been offered that job.

10
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.450
<v 1>There's been plenty of discussion about movies,</v>

11
00:00:44.451 --> 00:00:48.200
reflecting the tragedy and chaos during the time they were made such as monster

12
00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:51.710
movies, showing cold war anxieties and 21st century horror movies,

13
00:00:51.711 --> 00:00:53.660
conveying fears of acts of terror.

14
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.260
But what about movies that came out during a time of general peace and security?

15
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.930
In other words, how can a film reflect stability?

16
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.890
Maybe one of the best years in film to explore this question is 1999.

17
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.280
Not only is it the turn of the millennia and the end of a prosperous decade,

18
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.390
but that you're also had many movies that deal with the stable uneventful world

19
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.260
of the nineties.

20
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.250
Let's see what the most popular movies can tell us about that unique moment in

21
00:01:16.251 --> 00:01:17.084
history.

22
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.380
<v 0>This is the world that, you know, world,</v>

23
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.270
as it was at the end of the 20th century.

24
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.220
<v 1>The nineties were defined by more than just a stability in the present because</v>

25
00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:31.490
of that stability people very actively looked into the future.

26
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.970
the.com bubble of the late nineties and early two thousands provides a great

27
00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:37.310
example of this forward-thinking tech companies.

28
00:01:37.311 --> 00:01:39.590
Weren't being valued on what they were currently worth,

29
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.850
but what they could be worth.

30
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.470
<v 0>We marveled at our own magnificence as we gave birth to.</v>

31
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.520
<v 1>Of course, with those positive outlooks also came anxieties.</v>

32
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.160
Technology led to fears of the Y2K bug.

33
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.760
The idea that the switch to the year 2000 would crash many vital computer

34
00:01:55.761 --> 00:01:57.350
systems and create chaos.

35
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.530
It's actually what Peter has to fix at his job in office space.

36
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.050
From here we get what makes some 1999 movies.

37
00:02:03.051 --> 00:02:07.460
So 1999 in general movies released in that year were not about surviving the

38
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.980
present because the present was actually going well.

39
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.730
They were about being tired of that stable presence and looking for a radically

40
00:02:13.731 --> 00:02:14.570
different future.

41
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.140
It's a timely take on the hero's journey where the call to action isn't caused

42
00:02:18.141 --> 00:02:21.110
by some ethics circumstance, but from the lack of ethic.

43
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.880
<v 0>And yeah, what do you do there? I sit in a Cuban.</v>

44
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.060
<v 1>Cool, of course not all movies from that year, capture this idea,</v>

45
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.150
especially the genre movies and movies from a different time period.

46
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.630
But the lack of Epic does exist in a surprisingly large amount of them.

47
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.290
Perhaps the most obvious symbol of that boring nineties lifestyle is from the

48
00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:43.490
recurring image of the plane cubicle, which shows up in many movies from 1999,

49
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.630
there are classic visual reminder of the dead end job, a job that may be stable,

50
00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:49.550
but has no future and no excitement.

51
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.270
It's from this powerful visual that I affectionately named the style of movie,

52
00:02:53.271 --> 00:02:54.230
the cubicle movie,

53
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.100
but not every cubicle movie uses a literal cubicle to show this feeling.

54
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.960
The boondock saints is a crime thriller about the criminal underworld in Boston,

55
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.720
but even in a movie so far removed from corporate life,

56
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.080
it still clearly showcases Rocko having that same unfulfilling,

57
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:10.300
stable job as a package boy for the mob.

58
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.950
<v 0>Remembered I've been working for those fat bastard since I've been an ice cream</v>

59
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.980
place. You're me, man.

60
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.400
<v 1>So you don't have to have a literal desk job to show this nineties anxiety.</v>

61
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.120
Any character can be stuck this way so long as it feels corporate never changing

62
00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:25.800
and stable to the point of boredom.

63
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.100
<v 0>I'm a water saver.</v>

64
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.390
<v 1>It's not that filmmakers were actively trying to summarize the nineties climate</v>

65
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.020
it's that every filmmaker made their movie within that period of time.

66
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.780
So that period will inevitably influence the production.

67
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.930
The cubicle movie has a premise based in that 90 stability.

68
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.650
So a significant percentage of these movies create conflict out of a very

69
00:03:49.651 --> 00:03:50.790
similar atmosphere.

70
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.160
<v 0>It doesn't really matter. I, uh,</v>

71
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.180
I don't like my job and I don't think I'm going to go anymore.

72
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.430
<v 1>The product of this stability is also monotony and monotony allows space for</v>

73
00:04:02.431 --> 00:04:03.840
introspection. As a result,

74
00:04:03.841 --> 00:04:07.320
a lot of these films deal with identity and stories about private lives.

75
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.110
American beauty is about the inner lives of suburban neighbors.

76
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.620
While the setting of the film represents the idyllic American landscape of the

77
00:04:13.621 --> 00:04:17.940
time, the characters represent the anxieties underlying that pristine exterior,

78
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.340
both the families have unfulfilling home lives.

79
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.090
The father is a borderline sexual predator and the neighbor is a secret white

80
00:04:24.091 --> 00:04:27.900
supremacist who also happens to have repressed homosexual feelings.

81
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.050
This movie criticizes the perceived stability of the era,

82
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.290
suggesting that it's simply a mask that hides the true self,

83
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.490
the flowers in the garden,

84
00:04:35.491 --> 00:04:38.040
the couch and the nineties lifestyle are not true beauty,

85
00:04:38.041 --> 00:04:39.450
but rather mimicking beauty.

86
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.350
It's an artificial American beauty by club takes this opportunity for

87
00:04:43.351 --> 00:04:47.310
introspection and turns it into a conversation about manhood a world without

88
00:04:47.311 --> 00:04:50.250
conflict means a world where men don't have a way to assert their own

89
00:04:50.251 --> 00:04:51.000
masculinity.

90
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.450
So the characters go to great lengths to manufacture conflict and chaos,

91
00:04:54.451 --> 00:04:56.460
to satisfy their masculine impulses.

92
00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.480
The movie satirizes this way of thinking as an ineffective and unproductive way

93
00:05:00.481 --> 00:05:03.930
to find purpose, even though the film was intended as a cautionary tale,

94
00:05:03.931 --> 00:05:07.890
many men took it a bit too. Literally, maybe the satire was too relevant.

95
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.191
Really.

96
00:05:08.191 --> 00:05:11.340
The movie reminds us that the stability and uneventful illness of the nineties

97
00:05:11.341 --> 00:05:14.310
was largely a middle-class white male phenomenon, film,

98
00:05:14.311 --> 00:05:18.450
starring minorities or women like boys don't cry and all about my mother show us

99
00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:21.660
that for some people, the nineties were anything but boring and stable.

100
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.960
These movies highlight the issues still present underneath that stable,

101
00:05:24.961 --> 00:05:27.000
suburban exterior cubicle movie star,

102
00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:30.330
men who have so little conflict in their life that they seek it out and they can

103
00:05:30.331 --> 00:05:33.090
only really do so because they have the time and the money.

104
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.170
And there's no movie from 1999 that expresses the ideas of the cubicle movie

105
00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:38.880
more than being John Malcovich.

106
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.630
The film exaggerates the oppressive corporate imagery in films like office space

107
00:05:42.631 --> 00:05:45.570
by creating an absurd office with low ceilings here,

108
00:05:45.571 --> 00:05:49.470
the office literally bears down on its employees when crack discovers a portal

109
00:05:49.471 --> 00:05:52.260
that lets you live in John Malcovich his mind for 15 minutes,

110
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.540
he uses it to escape his boring life.

111
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.700
He even monetizes the portal and it has massive to people who are tired of their

112
00:05:58.701 --> 00:06:02.420
boring lives and want to mimic the seemingly exciting life of a celebrity.

113
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.530
Craig uses Malcovich his status for sexual gratification and career goals,

114
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.680
but these shallow desires never lead him to true happiness.

115
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.310
Living the life of someone else means he never worked to make his own life

116
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.700
better.

117
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.360
He tried to escape his problems by mimicking someone else instead of exploring

118
00:06:17.361 --> 00:06:19.550
what was within himself. Charlie Kaufman said,

119
00:06:19.551 --> 00:06:22.790
he wrote the film while he worked as a writer on the TV show, get a life.

120
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.700
The best part of the show came from the scripts written by its original

121
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:28.910
creators. So all the other writers tried to imitate their voice.

122
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.400
The results he said was extremely unfulfilling.

123
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.290
Not only because it wasn't personal work,

124
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.920
but because mimicking someone else inherently means that you are not interesting

125
00:06:36.921 --> 00:06:39.170
enough being John Malcovich. And to an extent,

126
00:06:39.171 --> 00:06:42.320
all cubicle movies seem to reflect this idea in some way,

127
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.070
social forces compel us to conform ourselves into a certain definition of

128
00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:48.950
success, like having the good job and a comfortable life,

129
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.520
but having to do this requires the belief that who we already are isn't good

130
00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:56.270
enough. I think cubicle movies are trying to remind us that we are worth it.

131
00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.810
The point is there doesn't have to be some crisis going on for a movie to

132
00:06:59.811 --> 00:07:00.980
reflect world events.

133
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.600
1999 had this crazy phenomenon where nearly a dozen major Hollywood releases

134
00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:08.030
feature a main character, tired of the stability,

135
00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:10.340
monotony and uneventful illness of their life.

136
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.310
And it's a perfect mirror of what America was like in the late nineties.

137
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.150
The movies of that year reminded people to reclaim their confidence and search

138
00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:20.000
for a more exciting and personal future. In other words,

139
00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:21.860
they reminded us to party like it's 19. Now.

140
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:29.380
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

141
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.180
<v 1>Truly understand the production of a movie.</v>

142
00:07:31.181 --> 00:07:33.850
You also have to understand the time period it was made.

143
00:07:33.851 --> 00:07:37.120
In another classic example of history, influencing film is German.

144
00:07:37.121 --> 00:07:39.130
Expression is cinema of the 1920s.

145
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.160
Not only should you watch some of those movies, but to understand them better.

146
00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:45.460
I'd also recommend you learn about the impact of world war one on Germany,

147
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.520
which greatly altered their society. And in turn their movies,

148
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.860
you can learn more about that time in the secrets of world war,

149
00:07:50.861 --> 00:07:54.850
