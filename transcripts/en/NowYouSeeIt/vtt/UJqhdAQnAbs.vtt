00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:02.910
<v 0>Since.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.320
<v 1>The beginning of game of Thrones,</v>

3
00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:06.840
the show felt like it could never end in the book.

4
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:11.100
Present shock Douglas Rushkoff uses the show's opening title sequence as an

5
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.360
allegory to this problem.

6
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.550
<v 2>The camera pans over an animated map of the entire world of the saga,</v>

7
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.460
showing the various divisions and cleanse within the empire.

8
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.570
It is drawn in the style of a fantasy role-playing math used by participants as

9
00:00:23.571 --> 00:00:27.320
the game board for their battles and intrigues and like a fantasy role-playing

10
00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:30.560
game. The show is not about grating, satisfying resolutions,

11
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.010
but rather about keeping the adventure life and as many threads going as

12
00:00:34.011 --> 00:00:36.650
possible. There is plot, there are many plots,

13
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.460
but there is no overarching story. No end. There are so many plants.

14
00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:44.060
In fact that an ending tying everything up seems inconceivable.

15
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.290
Even beside the points.

16
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.210
<v 1>Rushkoff definitely has a point.</v>

17
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.200
The best word to describe the earlier seasons of the show would probably be

18
00:00:51.201 --> 00:00:52.760
chaotic main characters,

19
00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:56.630
die at a moment's notice and plots meander in many different directions.

20
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.030
And that's part of the appeal of game of Thrones.

21
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.480
It's exciting to experience a world where the present moment is so

22
00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:03.320
unpredictable,

23
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.220
but what Rushkoff fails to mention is the narrative hidden beneath the surface

24
00:01:07.221 --> 00:01:11.510
of all that present chaos in reality game of Thrones does have a story.

25
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.540
It is the story of characters traumatized by the past,

26
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.110
shocked in the present and looking for a future to believe in. Yes,

27
00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:20.900
the world of game of Thrones is defined by chaos,

28
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.010
but many characters in game of Thrones are not they're instead defined by their

29
00:01:25.011 --> 00:01:28.220
struggle to find a story within the world. They exist in.

30
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.880
There's no episode that makes this distinction better than in the season six

31
00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:35.060
finale. The winds of winter, the episode shows us characters,

32
00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:38.060
trying to make sense of the world in many different ways.

33
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.320
By putting them all together.

34
00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:42.980
This episode becomes a metaphor for the entire series as a whole.

35
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.390
It is the symbolic end of the chaotic era of game of Thrones from seasons one

36
00:01:47.391 --> 00:01:48.050
through six.

37
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.800
And at the beginning of its attempt of finding meaning within that chaos

38
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.800
Episode begins with the biggest act of chaos in the show's entire run up to this

39
00:02:06.801 --> 00:02:09.080
point, the destruction of the set of Baylor.

40
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.280
This sequence leads up to an act of terrorism orchestrated by Searcy Lannister,

41
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.510
the character who most embodies the chaos and cynicism present in the game of

42
00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:19.310
Thrones world. Up to this point,

43
00:02:19.311 --> 00:02:22.490
she and her family have been responsible for the show's most significant

44
00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:24.500
discontinuity in its linear narrative.

45
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.070
She and her son had the show's main character killed in the ninth episode.

46
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.550
She and her father had more main characters killed in the red wedding and she

47
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:35.720
herself has lost all attachment to the future. After two of her children died,

48
00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:39.110
suddenly she gave up on preserving anything other than herself,

49
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.060
and those immediately loyal to her.

50
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.090
We can therefore see her destruction of the set of Baylor,

51
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.850
along with the religious hierarchy, political rivals,

52
00:02:46.851 --> 00:02:50.450
and many more main characters as the ultimate act of chaos.

53
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.020
Not only does she destroy the literal embodiment of belief in the seven

54
00:02:54.021 --> 00:02:55.070
kingdoms, but she does it.

55
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.500
<v 0>Because it felt good to watch them burn.</v>

56
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.540
Good to imagine that shock and pain.

57
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.390
<v 1>Searcy doesn't destroy the Sept because she has some plot for world domination.</v>

58
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.270
She does it because she feels she has nothing left to lose.

59
00:03:09.271 --> 00:03:10.770
And when someone has nothing to lose,

60
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.740
they can risk everything to end up on top Marjorie,

61
00:03:13.741 --> 00:03:17.940
a character with just as much political savvy as Searcy is the only one in the

62
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.320
[inaudible].

63
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.090
<v 0>So has he understands the consequences of her absence she's absent anyway,</v>

64
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.850
which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences.

65
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.850
<v 1>The other characters are so blinded in their belief,</v>

66
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.890
in the sanctity of religious traditions,

67
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.520
that they couldn't fathom the possibility that Searcy wouldn't show up for the

68
00:03:35.521 --> 00:03:37.920
trial, much less retaliate with violence.

69
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.850
Searcy cynicism is an advantage while others cling to their beliefs,

70
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.120
she decides to embrace the chaos and protect herself.

71
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.080
Her destruction of the set is the epitome of the chaotic worlds of game of

72
00:03:49.081 --> 00:03:50.400
Thrones. Ironically,

73
00:03:50.401 --> 00:03:54.660
this act of chaos is also the beginning of a more linear ending to the show.

74
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.770
It gets rid of multiple important characters and ends a major plot line that has

75
00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:01.890
dominated the show for the last two seasons. Thus,

76
00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:06.000
the show begins its shift from a chaotic and meandering character study to an

77
00:04:06.001 --> 00:04:09.000
ending oriented and plot focus to TV drama.

78
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.510
The winds of winter begins with the familiar chaos of game of Thrones,

79
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.990
but the rest of the episode shows us something unfamiliar characters,

80
00:04:15.991 --> 00:04:19.350
banding together, getting revenge and realizing their destinies.

81
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.090
<v 0>Um, to be the new master.</v>

82
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.270
<v 1>This episode focuses on wrap-up of various characters, plot lines,</v>

83
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.440
a further attempt at bringing an end to the chaos Jamie's military campaign

84
00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:39.240
ends. Sam reaches old town Melisandre is cast away Jon and Sansa resolved their

85
00:04:39.241 --> 00:04:41.880
tension and some unlikely alliances form.

86
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.690
As we landed Marine with Denaris the show points towards some finality and

87
00:04:45.691 --> 00:04:46.380
progress.

88
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.100
Walton Aeris has spent the entire show in SOC growing as a leader and as a

89
00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:54.090
character, she was always going to return to Westeros, to reclaim the throne,

90
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.410
her conversation with Darrio Novaris shows us she is finally ready to take this

91
00:04:58.411 --> 00:05:00.510
crucial step in her personal narrative.

92
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.880
Denaris his whole life story has been about her,

93
00:05:02.881 --> 00:05:05.310
right to the iron throne while Searcy desires,

94
00:05:05.311 --> 00:05:09.030
power out of a desire for self-preservation Denaris fights for the throne

95
00:05:09.031 --> 00:05:10.680
because of a belief in destiny.

96
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.820
<v 0>To walk. My birthright is seven kingdoms of Western.</v>

97
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.660
<v 1>Her right to rule comes from a belief in a story about succession,</v>

98
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.270
but Searcy rules because she tore down those beliefs.

99
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.820
This is why Tyrian decides to support Denaris.

100
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.100
<v 0>So I said, no, thank you to believe.</v>

101
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.370
And yet here I am.

102
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.930
I believe in you.

103
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.880
<v 1>Tyrian a self-proclaimed Sinek son of the most cold-hearted politician in</v>

104
00:05:38.881 --> 00:05:43.020
Westeros Ann's brother of Searcy herself finds his faith into an Eris.

105
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.920
Her potential rule offers a restoration from the chaos brought by his family,

106
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.020
and it is why she is central to this story.

107
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.280
She hopes to restore the stories and institutions undone by civil Wars and

108
00:05:53.281 --> 00:05:57.950
cynical Lords. Back in Westeros, we get another satisfying Arias,

109
00:05:57.951 --> 00:06:01.160
revenge murder of Walder Frey for his portrayal of her family.

110
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.680
This scene shows a different solution to the chaos.

111
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.160
<v 0>The last thing you're ever going to see is a stock smiling down at you as you</v>

112
00:06:09.161 --> 00:06:09.994
die.

113
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.570
<v 1>It's a satisfying moment in game of Thrones because this type of justice is so</v>

114
00:06:13.571 --> 00:06:17.830
rare. The idea of justice itself is a story. It requires cause and effect,

115
00:06:17.831 --> 00:06:21.460
and the writing of Iran while Searcy's retribution at the start of this episode

116
00:06:21.461 --> 00:06:25.540
was explosive and indiscriminate Arias retribution is incisive and personal.

117
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.700
Then in Winterfeld the Lord of chaos himself,

118
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.510
Peter Baelish speaks with Sansa by the werewolf tree Sansar remarks on her

119
00:06:31.511 --> 00:06:35.350
growth from a naive aspiring princess to cynical ward Innes of the North.

120
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.620
<v 0>Like then I initial smells. I wanted never, I had.</v>

121
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.350
<v 1>The most prominent victim of chaos in the show.</v>

122
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.310
Her multiple traumas have created a discontinuity in her personal narrative

123
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.370
while she wants prayed and wanted to become a princess, the horse,

124
00:06:48.371 --> 00:06:52.630
she has been subjected to have crushed her belief in stories and Tappy endings

125
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.170
like Searcy and little finger. This cynicism is her advantage,

126
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.300
but even in such a hopeless character,

127
00:06:58.301 --> 00:07:02.710
the show manages to find her something to believe in a way to end her trauma and

128
00:07:02.711 --> 00:07:06.640
finish her story. Setting this scene in the gods would hints at that one.

129
00:07:06.641 --> 00:07:08.320
Last thing that Sansa believes.

130
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.900
<v 0>I love the future of how stark her family.</v>

131
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.250
Finally.

132
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.630
<v 1>We see the immensely consequential vision of John's true parentage leading into</v>

133
00:07:19.631 --> 00:07:21.730
the scene where he is declared King in the North.

134
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.100
The John is the rightful heir to the iron throne.

135
00:07:24.101 --> 00:07:28.180
Heritage is not the basis of his leadership like it is for Denaris nor is it

136
00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:30.490
simply because he killed his enemies like Searcy.

137
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.020
While these things are a part of it,

138
00:07:32.021 --> 00:07:35.260
they only matter because he could unite the disparate houses under a single

139
00:07:35.261 --> 00:07:39.820
banner without this popular approval John's rule would be just another chaotic

140
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:40.390
plot line.

141
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:44.770
But they're overwhelming support shows that people will put chaos and cynicism

142
00:07:44.771 --> 00:07:48.640
aside to fight for a common cause something rare for the series.

143
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.270
John is able to do this because he gave the Northern Lord something beyond the

144
00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:55.930
present to believe in his warnings of white walkers and the army of the dead,

145
00:07:55.931 --> 00:07:59.380
motivated them to put rivalries on hold, to fight a common enemy.

146
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:03.280
John represents an alternative to chaos and to restoring old stories.

147
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.750
So at the end of the winds of winter,

148
00:08:04.751 --> 00:08:08.830
we have two opposed coronations and another would be ruler on the way one who

149
00:08:08.831 --> 00:08:11.170
represents the chaos of a world without a story.

150
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.190
Another who promises to restore an old story and a third who offers a different

151
00:08:15.191 --> 00:08:19.030
story entirely at its core game of Thrones has been a story about people finding

152
00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:21.160
ways to survive in an uncertain world,

153
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:24.310
learning to trust in one another to fight for common causes and to

154
00:08:24.311 --> 00:08:26.890
reconstructing a new narrative in a world without any.

155
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.720
But before this finale episode,

156
00:08:28.721 --> 00:08:32.590
the show was more about people finding their way through the present chaos.

157
00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.090
And after this episode,

158
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:38.410
it became about pushing characters towards a future that wrapped up the past as

159
00:08:38.411 --> 00:08:39.700
Thrones moved towards a world,

160
00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:42.730
driven by story and away from a world driven by chaos.

161
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.530
It had to make a complete shift,

162
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.520
no longer focusing on the exciting and watchable present chaos.

163
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.710
Of course the show had to end sometime,

164
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:55.140
but endings are in a way against everything that made game of Thrones special in

165
00:08:55.141 --> 00:08:57.390
the first place. Nonetheless, it's the fantasy.

166
00:08:57.391 --> 00:09:01.380
We've all been indulging in for the last decade because it speaks to a universal

167
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:04.980
struggle. So don't be sad how the show ends because in reality,

168
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:06.360
there's no time like the present.

169
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:14.750
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

170
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:15.620
<v 1>In present shock.</v>

171
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.130
Rushkoff sometimes sounds pretty pessimistic about the current cultural

172
00:09:19.131 --> 00:09:22.430
landscape. He stresses how technology traps us in the presence,

173
00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.340
not letting ideas and thoughts half the time they need to settle.

174
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:29.030
The cruel irony of this issue is that the internet does give us the opportunity

175
00:09:29.031 --> 00:09:31.220
to learn and consume in a productive way.

176
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.550
If you're doing something that takes time and effort like writing your own

177
00:09:34.551 --> 00:09:38.150
story, the internet gives you access to the best stories like Daniel,

178
00:09:38.151 --> 00:09:39.110
Jose older,

179
00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:43.250
a New York times best-selling author who has his own class on storytelling on

180
00:09:43.251 --> 00:09:45.470
Skillshare. I think Skillshare is helping solve,

181
00:09:45.471 --> 00:09:50.240
present shock with their online selection of over 25,000 classes in creative

182
00:09:50.241 --> 00:09:50.660
writing,

183
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:54.620
video editing and more premium membership gives you the opportunity to really

184
00:09:54.621 --> 00:09:58.400
spend time joining classes and communities that match your exact goals.

188
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.900
