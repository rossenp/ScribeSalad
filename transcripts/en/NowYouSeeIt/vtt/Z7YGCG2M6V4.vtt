00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.660
<v 0>[Inaudible] they shut down. The baby will be destroyed for sure.</v>

2
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.150
<v 1>Pretty much every sound effect and a large chunk of dialogue is made up in</v>

3
00:00:17.151 --> 00:00:20.480
post-production from footsteps to gunshots, to R2D2,

4
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.920
but there's more to sound design than just making believable sounds.

5
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.370
Humans are surprisingly good at associating many different sounds with a

6
00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:29.990
particular action on screen,

7
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.650
which is why we can think this is rainfall when it's actually sizzling bacon,

8
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.510
clever designers use this human ability to add emotion to their mixing.

9
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.970
Instead of making perfectly realistic sounds,

10
00:00:40.971 --> 00:00:44.420
they'll create sounds that seem close enough to the actual thing to keep us

11
00:00:44.421 --> 00:00:47.720
immersed, but that also carry the emotional feeling of the sound.

12
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.330
The result is brain trickery, but more importantly,

13
00:00:50.331 --> 00:00:53.460
the sound tells us how to feel to see what I mean. Let's do some.

14
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.860
<v 0>No, I will not be quite to Bucca. Why doesn't anybody? Listen to me.</v>

15
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.550
<v 1>One movie that effectively deceives our ears is star Wars,</v>

16
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.870
and it's not just lying because they added sound to after filming sound

17
00:01:05.871 --> 00:01:06.261
designer.

18
00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:10.820
Ben Burt also had to imagine completely new sounds oftentimes mixing them from

19
00:01:10.821 --> 00:01:14.330
everyday noises like much of the other sound design around star Wars.

20
00:01:14.331 --> 00:01:17.090
The sounds are fresh enough to transport us to a new world,

21
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.810
but familiar enough so that they elicit a particular emotional reaction.

22
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.630
The sound of the tie fighters comes from the roar of element.

23
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.670
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

24
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.350
<v 1>But they also sound very similar to the German dive bombers from world war II.</v>

25
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.130
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

26
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.990
<v 1>Whether or not this connection was intentional.</v>

27
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.420
It's subtly reminds us they're the bad guys here.

28
00:01:38.421 --> 00:01:39.920
The sound is not only believable,

29
00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:42.200
but it also provides the correct emotional cue,

30
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.780
but Burt does more than just convey feeling through sound.

31
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.090
He uses the sound to tell a story.

32
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.540
He accomplishes this feat with perhaps the most famous sound in movies,

33
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.330
Noting that our first impression of Darth Vader doesn't come from his voice,

34
00:01:59.331 --> 00:02:02.750
but from his breathing, without that particularly human sound effect,

35
00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:04.940
he would only be a faceless villain in armor.

36
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.170
But with the addition of the sound of his breathing, our imaginations run wild.

37
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.680
How did he get to be this way? Is it assistance or is it enhancement?

38
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.560
The mechanical sounds compliments his super human strength,

39
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.720
but it also implies a human side of him.

40
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.610
Not only does it sound like life support,

41
00:02:19.611 --> 00:02:23.750
but it quickens when he duels showing he's not invincible is ambiguous sound,

42
00:02:23.751 --> 00:02:27.260
design compliments his mystery as a villain, as well as his character arc,

43
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.250
right? From the beginning,

44
00:02:28.251 --> 00:02:32.030
we get a subtle indication of a flawed and potentially redeemable character

45
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.350
before Bert aliens tended to have cold and flat sound design with the generic.

46
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.410
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

47
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.610
<v 1>Storytelling into his made up sounds so that Shabaka can sound like an alien</v>

48
00:02:43.611 --> 00:02:46.850
creature while also having a broad and earthly emotion.

49
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.040
<v 0>All right, don't lose your temper.</v>

50
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.790
<v 1>And he adds that emotion to all his sounds, not just with aliens.</v>

51
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.650
<v 0>You listen to explosions off on the news. Things recorded in actual warfare.</v>

52
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:03.610
Sometimes it doesn't seem to have quite the body and the tone range that you are

53
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:05.110
used to hearing in motion pictures.

54
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.880
<v 1>The best explosion sounds bird actually had to mix them from missiles, rockets,</v>

55
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.580
and tanks, even with an actual sound available.

56
00:03:14.581 --> 00:03:17.880
He fabricated his own to capture the emotion behind the scenes.

57
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.060
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

58
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.320
<v 1>Filmmakers regularly add style to pre-existing noises for emotional effect and</v>

59
00:03:28.321 --> 00:03:32.130
Sergio Leoni movies. The gunshot noise is actually the sound of a Canon.

60
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.410
<v 0>Fire. This choice.</v>

61
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.010
<v 1>Perfectly embodies the exaggerated style of spaghetti westerns,</v>

62
00:03:38.011 --> 00:03:41.880
giving gunshots more weight in Epic showdowns, where every bullet counts,

63
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.520
the sound wouldn't fit in early John Wayne westerns,

64
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.220
where gunfire is frequent and less consequential.

65
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.400
A gunshot can capture the overall feeling of an action movie.

66
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.760
The sound designers for no country for old men specifically said they weren't

67
00:03:53.761 --> 00:03:56.580
looking to create something realistic out of their gunshots,

68
00:03:56.581 --> 00:03:57.720
but something menacing.

69
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.360
They described the silence or noise as homemade and the sound suits Anton

70
00:04:03.361 --> 00:04:06.870
perfectly, even though he acts so cold and evil,

71
00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:10.530
his murder sound intimate and personal as he invades people's homes and

72
00:04:10.531 --> 00:04:11.340
workplaces,

73
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.850
this mixing of the intimate and the calculated creates a conflicting and

74
00:04:14.851 --> 00:04:18.030
disturbing atmosphere around our villain. When it comes to Anton,

75
00:04:18.031 --> 00:04:21.450
you're the most vulnerable where you're the most comfortable when listening to a

76
00:04:21.451 --> 00:04:22.290
gun in a movie,

77
00:04:22.291 --> 00:04:25.980
the sound gives you a better idea of the kind of movie you're watching than the

78
00:04:25.981 --> 00:04:27.660
actual sound of a gunshot,

79
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.100
which is part of the reason why this sounds a lot different than that.

80
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.323
<v 0>Yes.</v>

81
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.940
<v 1>The feeling of chaotic combat in saving private Ryan sound designer,</v>

82
00:04:38.941 --> 00:04:43.050
Gary ride strum placed heavy emphasis on bullets moving instead of just

83
00:04:43.051 --> 00:04:43.884
gunshots.

84
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.140
The D scene has different sounds for bullets hitting the ocean,

85
00:04:49.141 --> 00:04:50.490
the beach or helmets.

86
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.420
And this level of detail helps the scenes stand out from other war movies,

87
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.400
where all the bullets tend to feel the same.

88
00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.493
<v 0>Right.</v>

89
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.750
<v 1>Unseen and saving private Ryan opens with the beginning of rainfall.</v>

90
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.380
As it rains harder, we start to hear gunfire and for a few seconds,

91
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.100
it's impossible to differentiate the sound of rain from the sound of bullets.

92
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.910
<v 0>Here, we are.</v>

93
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.600
<v 1>Literally hearing gunfire rain down on us. It's a clever auditory trick,</v>

94
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.840
but more importantly, it places us in the same emotional space.

95
00:05:21.841 --> 00:05:23.160
As the characters on screen,

96
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.940
the entire movie is an incredible example of subjective sound in the same way

97
00:05:26.941 --> 00:05:30.420
that a director of photography chooses what to focus on the sound designer in

98
00:05:30.421 --> 00:05:33.750
saving private Ryan chooses what the audience should hear at the beginning of

99
00:05:33.751 --> 00:05:36.270
the sniper standoff. You can hear people in the town,

100
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.100
artillery and socialists talking.

101
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.740
Once we see the two snipers looking from their scopes,

102
00:05:40.741 --> 00:05:42.270
we only hear water dripping.

103
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.630
We cut from the German drips on the window to the metallic trips from the

104
00:05:45.631 --> 00:05:46.200
American,

105
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.430
the isolation of a specific sound differentiates the two spaces and puts us in

106
00:05:50.431 --> 00:05:53.730
the snipers head tuning out our surroundings to land an important shot.

107
00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:58.763
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

108
00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.400
<v 1>Sounds can be a completely subjective experience depending on the moment in</v>

109
00:06:06.401 --> 00:06:09.910
raging bull. Jake appears to hear everything Vicki says to Tommy,

110
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.440
even though she's across the room,

111
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.930
the dialogue is also out of sync with their lips,

112
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.630
implying that Jake is imagining it all in the movie.

113
00:06:16.631 --> 00:06:20.980
Jake asserts his manhood to himself and the public by beating up other men.

114
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.890
He takes pride in the praise he gets while fighting and sound designer.

115
00:06:23.891 --> 00:06:28.120
Frank Warner emphasizes the scrutiny he feels while in the ring, as he fights,

116
00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:30.700
we always hear faceless commentators judging his.

117
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:34.630
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

118
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.710
<v 1>Bulbs from the cameras constantly watch him increasing in intensity and</v>

119
00:06:38.711 --> 00:06:40.570
frequency during dramatic moments.

120
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.290
And soon that aggression and scrutiny shows itself outside of the ring.

121
00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.330
While Jake watches, Tommy and Vicki,

122
00:06:46.331 --> 00:06:49.210
we hear the same flashbulb noise over each cut.

123
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.120
Even though there aren't any cameras there in this moment,

124
00:06:52.121 --> 00:06:56.230
he feels the sounds of the ring, the sounds of others watching and judging him.

125
00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.430
But his opponent is now a man flirting with his wife through the sound design.

126
00:07:00.431 --> 00:07:05.080
We can hear how Jake now sees the real world as a boxing ring and everyone in it

127
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.900
as potential opponents. These sound choices, foreshadow,

128
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.570
the eventual fight between Joey and Jake, where we're here,

129
00:07:10.571 --> 00:07:13.600
the same animal noises. We previously only heard in the room.

130
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.130
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

131
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:21.491
<v 1>This movie,</v>

132
00:07:21.491 --> 00:07:25.030
the flashbulbs are a dark mechanical reminder of Jake's broken psyche.

133
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.210
His obsession with asserting masculinity ruined his life.

134
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.940
And he ends up completely alone because of it. And at the end,

135
00:07:30.941 --> 00:07:34.180
when he's lost everything, it's still the only thing he has.

136
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.040
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

137
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.770
<v 2>Sounded. Those flashbulbs were more than just a voice.</v>

138
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:48.820
There were five or six sounds in there working with for each one of those

139
00:07:48.821 --> 00:07:52.690
flashes. Martin asked me how I did that. I said, I won't tell you that.

140
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.150
And he got a little upset. And I said,

141
00:07:55.151 --> 00:07:57.310
if I told you all the magic would be gone.

142
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:02.920
<v 0>New card, what do you think?</v>

143
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.910
<v 1>It's fun to know the creative ways fully artists make their sounds.</v>

144
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.510
But the real innovation comes from the emotional effect of those sounds in

145
00:08:10.511 --> 00:08:11.350
American psycho.

146
00:08:11.351 --> 00:08:15.040
The cardholder opening is the sound of a sword coming out of a sheath.

147
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:20.200
It's the perfect sound for an already ridiculous scene where the comparison of

148
00:08:20.201 --> 00:08:24.370
business cards feels like a duel to the death. Through exaggerating noise.

149
00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:28.060
We enhance the dramatic moments and the same goes for comedic sound.

150
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.990
As the sound designer for naked gun said, it's funnier to not use reality,

151
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:36.700
but I think my favorite sound design choices are when filmmakers add noise,

152
00:08:36.701 --> 00:08:38.380
where there shouldn't be any in the first place.

153
00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:42.300
<v 0>It's a perfect one.</v>

154
00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.640
<v 1>Wait to give a weight to movement, whether it's for laughs or intensity.</v>

155
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:48.243
<v 0>Combing.</v>

156
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.000
<v 1>Some of the most imaginative sound design comes from the witch house keys where</v>

157
00:08:52.001 --> 00:08:54.820
they'll even add sound to the movement of the camera.

158
00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:58.401
They're filmed.

159
00:08:58.401 --> 00:09:02.720
The matrix is the perfect case study to see how far sounds can go. Designer.

160
00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:06.680
Dane Davis said he wanted the sound designed to evolve during the movie becoming

161
00:09:06.681 --> 00:09:08.900
increasingly stylistic and powerful.

162
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.540
The first fight with Trinity broke some rules,

163
00:09:11.541 --> 00:09:14.180
but the combat sounds relatively realistic.

164
00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.220
Other than Trinity's questionable feats,

165
00:09:16.221 --> 00:09:19.640
the opening fight has sound design that could have been in a typical action

166
00:09:19.641 --> 00:09:23.300
movie, but with each fight Davis recreated his noises from scratch.

167
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.600
Notice how the hits have a little bit more weight to them in the construct.

168
00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:30.680
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

169
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.340
<v 1>Simply more stylized sounds of the matrix. Contrast to the scenes in reality,</v>

170
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:37.700
where the sound design is always grounded and heavy by the lobby scene.

171
00:09:37.701 --> 00:09:39.740
The sound feels far removed from reality.

172
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:43.700
Davis slowed down and sped up the sound effects to show how Neil Ben's his own

173
00:09:43.701 --> 00:09:46.310
reality. At some moments, we only hear the bullets moving.

174
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.730
Other times only the sound of bullets hitting stone in this scene.

175
00:09:49.731 --> 00:09:52.940
The matrix pushes the envelope for what's possible in sound design.

176
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.510
And it's the movie's gradual progression to this point that helps make the

177
00:09:56.511 --> 00:09:59.690
scene. Believable Davis knew how far he could push the sound design.

178
00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.690
He had an idea to make the simulations reuse sound effects,

179
00:10:02.691 --> 00:10:03.950
to make it feel fake,

180
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:07.460
like having all the footsteps sound the same or make some sounds loop in the

181
00:10:07.461 --> 00:10:08.000
background.

182
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.450
But they ran into the problem that limitations of the matrix might feel like

183
00:10:11.451 --> 00:10:14.510
limitations of the filmmakers as in bad filmmaking.

184
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.330
So he knew when he could change the rules and when he couldn't.

185
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.201
But in many ways,

186
00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:21.350
the rules of the matrix are a lot like the rules of sound design.

187
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:24.950
<v 0>Some of them can be bent. Others can be broken.</v>

188
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.100
You hear that? Yeah.

189
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.700
That is the sound of a thousand terrible things heading this way.

190
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:36.140
<v 1>I think Ben Burt's sums up sound design best when describing making a space</v>

191
00:10:36.141 --> 00:10:38.870
shuttle sound by recording the Los Angeles freeway,

192
00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:43.250
I was miking at various distances, but the sound still didn't sound full enough.

193
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:47.180
I took that sound, ran it through a subwoofer, took all the highs out of it.

194
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.250
And when I added it to the production sound,

195
00:10:49.251 --> 00:10:52.880
somehow it sounded more like the real thing than the real thing.

196
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:55.160
<v 0>When.</v>

197
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.950
<v 1>It comes to sound design line gets us closer to the truth.</v>

198
00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:58.940
And depending on the movie,

199
00:10:58.941 --> 00:11:02.120
what that sound needs to feel like could be completely different.

200
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:06.320
A filmmaker's job first and foremost is to capture the emotion of a story.

201
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.050
And in many cases, actual realism comes second.

202
00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.200
So the next time you watch a movie, don't just pay attention to the sound,

203
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.600
pay attention to what that sound is trying to say.

204
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.240
<v 0>Because he never pushed. Do you hear that?</v>

205
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.570
It's the winds of change.

206
00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.080
You hear the wind creep one of these days.

207
00:11:27.081 --> 00:11:30.740
I am really gonna let you teach that guy. A lesson.

208
00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.270
<v 1>Many sound designers are secret about their craft.</v>

209
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.530
Frank Warner famously destroyed all his sounds after each movie and George Lucas

210
00:11:39.531 --> 00:11:43.100
owns a secluded ranch in California where his production companies gather their

211
00:11:43.101 --> 00:11:43.610
sounds.

212
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:46.910

213
00:11:46.911 --> 00:11:48.650
