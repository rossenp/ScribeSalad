00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.520
<v 0>I think about Ratatouille every time I cook.</v>

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.100
<v 1>Even.</v>

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.200
<v 0>If I'm just adding salt to pasta water,</v>

4
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.190
that movie captures how cooking feels or at least how I want it to feel.

5
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.840
And also how I want it to taste.

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.840
There are some movies and TV shows that stick with you long after you've

7
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:18.090
finished them. And you just can't help, but obsess,

8
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.800
no matter how pretentious you usually try to be the movies and TV I

9
00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:26.820
cherish the most are almost always the ones that stick with me in some unusual

10
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:28.950
way. This past summer,

11
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.430
my roommates and I realized we had a rodent infestation in our house.

12
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.570
And during the ensuing chaos of putting up traps,

13
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:38.010
clogging holes with steel wool,

14
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.920
and always feeling slightly uncomfortable on our ground floor,

15
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.740
a particular show from 2019 always came to mind.

16
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.150
And that's when I realized, I now think about Chernobyl.

17
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.610
Every time a disaster happens in my life,

18
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.330
no matter how small that show captured a feeling I hadn't seen anywhere else,

19
00:00:54.331 --> 00:00:57.780
but one that I experienced all the time, Chernobyl portrays crisis,

20
00:00:57.781 --> 00:00:59.970
how it actually happens in real life.

21
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.290
American disaster movies are full of heroes, individuals exercising.

22
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:06.480
The free will to do what they think is right.

23
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.930
It's a fantasy that goes all the way back to spaghetti westerns the story that

24
00:01:09.931 --> 00:01:14.280
the individual can write every wrong by challenging their fo to a showdown or by

25
00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:17.940
blowing up the enemy spaceship. But Chernobyl is anti story.

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.200
The disaster itself has no spectacle. It literally happens in the background.

27
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.100
There's no honor in what the Soviets had to do. It's scary. It's disturbing.

28
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.110
It's anti heroic in Chernobyl.

29
00:01:28.111 --> 00:01:31.890
The potential volunteers quickly realize they're being asked to participate in a

30
00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:32.790
suicide mission,

31
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.510
but the nervous recruits don't get a riveting speech from a president standing

32
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:40.590
in between fighter jets shot at a low angle that ends in everybody cheering and

33
00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:41.424
celebrating.

34
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.330
<v 1>They get this, they'll do it. If it goes, it must be done.</v>

35
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.470
<v 0>There's no rallying cry just like a real life disaster.</v>

36
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.950
No one is there to make them a hero and their sacrifice doesn't receive any

37
00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:54.320
spectacle or sense of triumph. In fact,

38
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.320
their dangerous task is in part shot in complete darkness.

39
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.930
Chernobyl gave me something. I didn't know I needed,

40
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.590
I hadn't realized how much I would enjoy a show that gave me such a strong and

41
00:02:03.591 --> 00:02:07.460
realistic alternative to the traditional and fantastical American approach to

42
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.833
disaster storytelling.

43
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.380
I can't help,

44
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.270
but feel like I missed out on something special by not seeing 2001,

45
00:02:17.271 --> 00:02:19.310
a space Odyssey. When it came out in theaters.

46
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.050
It's not my favorite movie of all time,

47
00:02:21.051 --> 00:02:23.660
but I'll always appreciate how bold and different it is.

48
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.700
Especially for a 1968 release.

49
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.000
Sometimes I feel like the golden era of filmmaking has already happened.

50
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.060
Like I missed a party that I would have really enjoyed when he grew up with a

51
00:02:32.061 --> 00:02:34.640
cynical dad showing you films from a bygone era.

52
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.050
It's hard not to think that way.

53
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.930
Will I ever get to sit in a theater and experience something like one of

54
00:02:38.931 --> 00:02:39.890
Kubrick's classics,

55
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.070
but then this fall I saw a film that's probably as close as I'm going to get.

56
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.190
The lighthouse is a complete trip into madness.

57
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.190
Following in the footsteps of atmospheric thrillers, like the shining,

58
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.730
it feels unsettling and hypnotic. And the dialogue by writer,

59
00:02:58.731 --> 00:03:02.830
director Eggers elevates the film beyond reality and into the mythic.

60
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.800
<v 1>Jordan paella deaths with treble dread make the ocean</v>

61
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.353
cave sharp bed.

62
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.990
<v 0>Epic has 2001. And as oddly mystical as the shining,</v>

63
00:03:12.991 --> 00:03:16.770
but this time there's a postmodern absurdity to it that makes it uniquely suited

64
00:03:16.771 --> 00:03:17.730
to the time we live in.

65
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.960
It's a genuinely hilarious film, but anytime something funny happens,

66
00:03:24.961 --> 00:03:27.900
you can barely tell if you're laughing because it's actually funny or because

67
00:03:27.901 --> 00:03:31.290
it's so tense, which in turn leads to more tension in one scene,

68
00:03:31.291 --> 00:03:35.130
Winslow played by Robert Pattinson simply tells wake played by Willem Defoe.

69
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.620
He doesn't like his cooking and wake response with.

70
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.580
<v 1>Try Jenna hark.</v>

71
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.790
<v 0>The severity of his threat in proportion to Winslow's drunken.</v>

72
00:03:47.791 --> 00:03:50.520
And mission is so absurd that it's instantly funny,

73
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.900
but it also serves the purpose.

74
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.680
It shows us Wake's dangerous sensitivity and his propensity to manipulate others

75
00:03:55.681 --> 00:03:59.370
into saying and doing what he wants. The scene sets the film in this unsettling,

76
00:03:59.371 --> 00:04:03.690
no man's land between threat and hilarity. That feels both old-timey and modern.

77
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:06.180
<v 1>Kubrick's.</v>

78
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.400
<v 0>Films were funny and had moments of absurdity.</v>

79
00:04:08.401 --> 00:04:10.320
But if they were as absurd as the lighthouse,

80
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.290
I think audiences and critics from the sixties and seventies wouldn't have

81
00:04:13.291 --> 00:04:17.400
understood it To put it this way.

82
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.520
The shining never would have worked in 1980. If it had fart jokes,

83
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.790
the lighthouse builds on what made these films innovative for their time,

84
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.110
but elevates new ideas that work particularly well for 2019. Honestly,

85
00:04:28.111 --> 00:04:29.790
a lot of this movie feels like a meme.

86
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.540
<v 1>Why Jewish beans don't me?</v>

87
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.970
<v 0>It's dark. It's silly. It's absurd.</v>

88
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.900
And it is entirely unashamedly and unequivocally weird.

89
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.570
This film about two stranded trunk,

90
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.230
farting lighthouse keepers shot on lenses from the turn of the century and

91
00:04:46.231 --> 00:04:50.280
presented in a one by 19 by one black and white format sticks out like a sore

92
00:04:50.281 --> 00:04:52.620
thumb in the era of the cinematic universe.

93
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.050
But I think it proves that there will always be room for weird.

94
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.200
<v 1>God Fox. Good.</v>

95
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.820
<v 0>My go-to romantic comedy was always 500 days of summer.</v>

96
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.460
We saw a lot of myself in Tom Hansen.

97
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.480
He's romantic to a fault and his misguided expectations teach him how to better

98
00:05:18.481 --> 00:05:20.550
handle future relationships. Overall,

99
00:05:20.551 --> 00:05:24.120
the film portrays his missteps in a pretty sympathetic light after all he is a

100
00:05:24.121 --> 00:05:25.050
hopeless romantic,

101
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.440
is it so bad that he just wants to be with the woman he loves from his point of

102
00:05:28.441 --> 00:05:30.180
view, his actions seem justified,

103
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.580
but I've always felt that we missed a part of the story.

104
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.470
We only see the relationship through Tom.

105
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.200
How do you think this story would be told from summer's point of view?

106
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.880
I think it would look a little more like this.

107
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:45.180
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

108
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.360
<v 0>I can't stop thinking about Fleabag because to my horror,</v>

109
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.730
I saw a piece of myself in her boyfriends.

110
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.830
And from her point of view, their romanticism is not justified sympathetic.

111
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.130
It's actually pretty lame and hilarious before watching this show,

112
00:06:01.131 --> 00:06:02.660
I hadn't seen with my own eyes,

113
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:06.620
the struggle women have navigating male egos in their dads, their coworkers,

114
00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:10.160
or their partners, older men were never allowed to express how they feel.

115
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.130
So they're doomed to a life of poor emotional communication.

116
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.490
<v 1>I want to say</v>

117
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:19.630
very much.

118
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.070
<v 0>For the younger generation of men that finally feel comfortable expressing</v>

119
00:06:24.071 --> 00:06:26.560
themselves. They're still extremely clumsy and fragile.

120
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.040
The priest in season two is a perfect counterpoint to this fragile male

121
00:06:30.041 --> 00:06:32.500
character in season one, by becoming a priest,

122
00:06:32.501 --> 00:06:36.730
he is in a way escape to the sexual and fraternal struggles. Men usually face.

123
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.310
Maybe that's partially why he's so appealing to Fleabag.

124
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.180
I can't stop thinking about this show because I was shocked to see myself in

125
00:06:43.181 --> 00:06:47.260
pathetic male characters. And I realized I owed my girlfriend a few apologies,

126
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.690
Difficult to define what these works of art have in common.

127
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.420
But I do think they all had a major directorial vision.

128
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.300
Each creator shared a story they personally understood,

129
00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.090
and this subject matter expertise made their work great.

130
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.270
The beauty of the internet is that we have instant access to experts in their

131
00:07:04.271 --> 00:07:06.010
fields. If we want to learn something,

132
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.490
if you want to learn the best ways to shoot a short documentary, for example,

133
00:07:09.491 --> 00:07:13.900
you can watch a class on that exact topic by Academy award nominated director,

134
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:18.070
Elaine Sheldon on Skillshare. Skillshare is huge catalog of classes on film,

135
00:07:18.071 --> 00:07:18.910
web development.

136
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.880
And marketing means that you can learn from the experts themselves,

137
00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.640
which is my go-to strategy for tackling a new topic.

138
