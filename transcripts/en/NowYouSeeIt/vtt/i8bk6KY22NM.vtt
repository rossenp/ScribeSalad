00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.020
<v 0>Mama stare violin, just hang on. He's coming.</v>

2
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.380
<v 1>How many genre movies can you think of with LGBT characters playing the heroes</v>

3
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.130
in the 1990s, Solano Chesky asked herself that exact question.

4
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.310
<v 2>My brain, one.</v>

5
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.630
<v 1>Of had this revelation after watching the silence of the lambs in theaters,</v>

6
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.710
which despite being an artistic triumph follows a long line of films like psycho

7
00:00:30.711 --> 00:00:34.670
dressed to kill and sleepaway camp where trans or gender fluid characters are

8
00:00:34.671 --> 00:00:38.060
not only the villains, but actually deranged psycho killers.

9
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.960
There have been sympathetic, characters, especially in more recent films,

10
00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:45.200
but the films almost always fit into one of two categories,

11
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.380
either they're lighthearted comedies or they're total downers,

12
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.690
but they're which house keys wanted to do something different.

13
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.890
They wanted to make a movie with sympathetic characters. That was a genre movie.

14
00:00:54.891 --> 00:00:55.460
First,

15
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.510
it would start a lesbian couple while still delivering the suspense and action

16
00:00:59.511 --> 00:01:03.590
of a classic new Warfield in the 1990s that had never been done before in a

17
00:01:03.591 --> 00:01:04.550
mainstream film.

18
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.150
But a lot of which house key enter sister Lily did exactly that when they wrote

19
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.140
in directed bound, the greatest lesbian gangster heist movie ever made.

20
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.720
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

21
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.380
<v 1>In 1994, the which house key sold two of their scripts to Warner brothers.</v>

22
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.900
The first was bound and the second was another film.

23
00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:25.880
They also wanted to direct the studio.

24
00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:29.360
Didn't trust them to direct the second film because it was much more expensive.

25
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.800
So they made bound first,

26
00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:34.130
which gave the studio the confidence to let them direct their second film,

27
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.700
a big budget Saifai with lots of fight scenes and special effects.

28
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.520
You may have heard of it. Do you know what I'm talking about?

29
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.670
The matrix, the matrix contains many now iconic techniques,

30
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.420
but bounce did a lot of them first, just on a smaller scale. In fact,

31
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.840
bounce has an early version of the now famous three 60 shot,

32
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.790
and it has bullets in slow motion.

33
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.090
<v 2>There's a terrific shot of the bullet flying through the air.</v>

34
00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.961
If you look at it carefully,

35
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:03.350
you can actually see the piece of led in a kind of very simple and formative

36
00:02:03.351 --> 00:02:05.270
way. That's the origins of bullet time.

37
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.010
<v 1>All the major crew for the matrix first collaborated together on bound,</v>

38
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.790
including the editor, cinematographer, composer, and sound designer.

39
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.060
And once you explore bounds, incredible understanding of the genre,

40
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.370
filmmaking techniques and character development.

41
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.640
It's no surprise that this creative team would go on to make a film as

42
00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:27.440
influential as the matrix bounce stars. Two women Corky,

43
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.850
a Butch lesbian who just got out of prison and file it a more feminine woman.

44
00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:34.340
Who's dating Caesar, a money launderer for the mob.

45
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.000
The story revolves around the two women becoming lovers and hatching,

46
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:41.390
a plan to steal $2 million from Caesar and the mafia there.

47
00:02:41.391 --> 00:02:43.460
Heist starts off as planned quirky,

48
00:02:43.461 --> 00:02:46.070
steals the money and hides it in the apartment. Next door.

49
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.730
Once Caesar finds out the money is stolen and they expect him to run away,

50
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.840
but he instead stays,

51
00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:54.560
put and tries to convince the mafia that he didn't take the money from here.

52
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.910
The plan spirals out of control in an homage to classic black and white noir

53
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.650
films. Many of the shots in the film look almost completely black and white and

54
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:07.030
cinematographer, bill Pope employed, film techniques popular in the 1950s,

55
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.650
such as high contrast in unbalanced composition to create a sense of unease.

56
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.810
As Caesar tries to find the stolen money,

57
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.530
his lighting gets more and more extreme showing his gradual descent into

58
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:21.310
madness, such extreme lighting techniques were common in old Nawar movies,

59
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.510
like double indemnity and the Maltese Falcon, along with the Nawar visuals.

60
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.020
The story also has noir elements, including an intricate plot,

61
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.890
a looming sense of doom and deceptive, morally ambiguous characters.

62
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.020
Violet embodies the femme fatale,

63
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.340
a noir character who uses her beauty to seduce and manipulate unsuspecting men.

64
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.330
When talking to men,

65
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.080
violet raises the pitch of her voice to appear more delicate and helpless,

66
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.080
and even quirky is initially suspicious of her flirtation.

67
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.740
All these tropes in bounds show that what Chelsea's understanding of genre,

68
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.790
but where the film truly shines. It's not an Sri creation of past genres,

69
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.270
but in how it builds on top of them and create something completely new.

70
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.690
The film does use monochromatic lighting like old black and white films,

71
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.360
but it's one, it breaks that rule that the film gets created.

72
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.140
<v 0>Oh my God, don't worry. They mine.</v>

73
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.620
<v 1>With such a de-saturated film.</v>

74
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.740
The which house keys used color to make things stand out color.

75
00:04:16.741 --> 00:04:18.930
Most often emphasizes the bloody violence,

76
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.660
but it also makes Johnny's cartoonish suit stand out,

77
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.740
showing his immaturity in the scene where violet seduces Corky her purple

78
00:04:25.741 --> 00:04:28.320
lipstick is often the only color in the shot,

79
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.250
which draws attention to her sexuality in the same way that color challenges,

80
00:04:32.251 --> 00:04:36.300
the visual design of Nawara Violet's character plays with the expectations of

81
00:04:36.301 --> 00:04:37.590
the Fenty towel defense.

82
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.430
The towel typically turns on the main character while quirky and violet plan the

83
00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:44.220
heist. We still don't know for sure if we can trust violet.

84
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:47.813
<v 0>She me.</v>

85
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.750
<v 1>The which house keys use the expected betrayal of the femme fatale to raise the</v>

86
00:04:51.751 --> 00:04:55.590
tension. But in the end, violet, doesn't do what we expected. Instead,

87
00:04:55.591 --> 00:04:59.160
we get to see in a war film where we actually root for the femme fatale rather

88
00:04:59.161 --> 00:05:02.040
than fear her. It totally flips the genre on its head.

89
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.670
This time the male gangster is the antagonist and the femme fatale is the

90
00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:08.790
protagonist in previous Wars. The femme fatale tricks,

91
00:05:08.791 --> 00:05:11.610
the main character as well as the audience, but inbound,

92
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.720
the audience is in on the deception since we know violet and Corky's plan from

93
00:05:15.721 --> 00:05:16.290
the beginning.

94
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.160
This shift in perspective creates a film full of dramatic irony intention

95
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.230
because we know everything about the heist.

96
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.530
Even if all the male characters don't have a clue from the beginning,

97
00:05:25.531 --> 00:05:29.700
the women are in control of both the frame and the story when Corky and violet

98
00:05:29.701 --> 00:05:32.670
first meet in the elevator, they clearly check each other out,

99
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.880
but all that flirting literally happens behind Caesar's back.

100
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.840
Unlike in most Chaunra films, the witch house keys wanted to make violet a calm,

101
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.070
calculated heroine.

102
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.970
They even had to reshoot an entire scene to make sure they didn't portray her as

103
00:05:44.971 --> 00:05:47.100
stereotypically frantic or over the top.

104
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.180
<v 0>I thought this would be a really good place for violet to reveal all the anger</v>

105
00:05:51.181 --> 00:05:54.360
that she had percolating below the surface, but I was wrong.

106
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.340
It would have been great if it was a Scorsese picture,

107
00:05:56.341 --> 00:05:58.100
but this is not a Scorsese picture. So I.

108
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.330
<v 3>Understand why they want three.</v>

109
00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.143
<v 1>Violence. Predicament.</v>

110
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.450
Inbound actually has a lot in common with the particulate of Karen and Martin

111
00:06:04.451 --> 00:06:06.010
Scorsese, film Goodfellas,

112
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.100
both characters are trapped in a relationship with a guy who works for the

113
00:06:09.101 --> 00:06:09.550
mafia.

114
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.270
Both films have a similar scene where the woman has the opportunity to shoot her

115
00:06:13.271 --> 00:06:15.130
man, but they turn out quite differently.

116
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.100
The Goodfellas scene follows the tradition of many Nawar films,

117
00:06:18.101 --> 00:06:21.130
like the Maltese, Falcon, the killers, and double indemnity,

118
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.410
where the women act frantic and unheroic,

119
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.480
and their fight against men feels desperate.

120
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.750
Now I won't spoil exactly how this scene in bound ends,

121
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.540
but let's just say that violet doesn't have that problem.

122
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.200
<v 0>Caesar. You don't know.</v>

123
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.910
<v 1>I love this line because it almost feels like violet is addressing the audience</v>

124
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.330
like Caesar. We had expectations for how this film would play out.

125
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.370
We expected violet would portray quirky.

126
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.940
We expected Caesar would keep his cool and we expected the women to be the

127
00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:51.850
victims, but like Caesar, we got tricked bounds,

128
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:55.270
toying with genre and refreshing ways is enough to make it a classic.

129
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.230
But another element of the film elevates it to the greatest lesbian gangster

130
00:06:59.231 --> 00:07:00.370
heist movie ever made.

131
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:04.803
<v 0>I don't think so.</v>

132
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.390
<v 1>Is one of the first, if not the first mainstream genre movies,</v>

133
00:07:10.391 --> 00:07:14.050
starring a sympathetic lesbian couple and the witch house keys hired lesbian

134
00:07:14.051 --> 00:07:14.890
author and critic,

135
00:07:14.891 --> 00:07:19.000
Susie bright to help them execute this concept in an authentic way together.

136
00:07:19.001 --> 00:07:21.220
They changed how movies portray sex,

137
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.600
both literally and symbolically by focusing on the feminine aspects of sex.

138
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.590
<v 3>This movie is so wet. This kind of style, you know, gangster movies.</v>

139
00:07:29.591 --> 00:07:32.020
Everything's about a hard-on everything's about being hard.

140
00:07:32.021 --> 00:07:36.130
And this movie was just wet, dripping wet all the time.

141
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.740
<v 1>Inbound the hand represents sex.</v>

142
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.850
A concept that according to bright resonated with the lesbian community, right?

143
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:44.860
<v 3>Hands are the sex organs in this.</v>

144
00:07:44.861 --> 00:07:48.010
And every lesbian understood that who saw the movie.

145
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.250
<v 1>So for the first time in an awar flick the witch house keys have a brand new</v>

146
00:07:51.251 --> 00:07:55.390
symbol at their disposal. The hand becomes a sex object. Pants unite,

147
00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:58.600
the two characters and symbolize Corky and Violet's connection.

148
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:02.800
When Cesar threatens to cut off Violet's fingers, it's a form of castration.

149
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.040
The films shows sexuality in a distinctly lesbian way,

150
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:10.210
especially in how Corky and violet present themselves quirky is the masculine

151
00:08:10.211 --> 00:08:14.050
Butch lesbian and violet is the girly fan playing into those stereotypes,

152
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.870
leads to some of the humor in the film like when violet correctly,

153
00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:18.850
guesses that Corky is good with her hands.

154
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.980
<v 0>I'll bet. Your car is 20 years old,</v>

155
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.730
truck truck course,

156
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.030
63 Chevy. I knew it.

157
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.660
<v 1>Still never reduces the two lesbians to caricature. In fact,</v>

158
00:08:31.661 --> 00:08:35.440
the two frequently break their stereotypes. When violet is alone with Corky,

159
00:08:35.441 --> 00:08:36.940
she downplays her fem side,

160
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:40.840
lowering her pitch and wearing jeans instead of a dress and violet isn't the

161
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:45.070
innocent curious woman seduced by the more confident lesbian it's the exact

162
00:08:45.071 --> 00:08:45.904
opposite.

163
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:47.373
<v 0>Yes.</v>

164
00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.190
<v 1>Cesar breaks from the expectations of atypical gangster.</v>

165
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.690
He's actually one of the more feminine characters in the film instead of the

166
00:08:57.691 --> 00:09:01.380
woman getting jealous like in Goodfellas Caesar is the one who hates the Gianni

167
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:04.860
flirts with violent of all the characters. He's the most hysterical.

168
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:08.040
And he even looks like a housewife when he puts on a smock and irons,

169
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:12.180
all of the money by playing with the expected roles of violet Corky and Caesar,

170
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:16.200
the which house keys create a brand new story while still delivering the thrills

171
00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:18.780
of a conventional a war. The film received praise,

172
00:09:18.781 --> 00:09:22.650
not just for its brand new plot, but also for its brand new portrayal of.

173
00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:24.350
<v 2>I'm just here to get laid.</v>

174
00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.360
<v 1>At the time that which house keys made bound to films about gay characters,</v>

175
00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:36.200
almost always showed them either ashamed or uncertain of their sexuality.

176
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.270
And that's a trend that continues to this day,

177
00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:42.440
but violet and Corky break that trend by not regretting their sex at all. So.

178
00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.810
<v 2>I don't think I can stand as women are apologize for lining.</v>

179
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:45.560
<v 1>Sex,</v>

180
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:50.270
the films unabashedly gay story combined with its clear understanding of lesbian

181
00:09:50.271 --> 00:09:53.570
culture led to many in the community, embracing the film.

182
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:58.490
<v 2>It was shown in the Castro theater, and it was filled with lesbians.</v>

183
00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:59.720
When the movie was over,

184
00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:03.290
the entire theater was pounding on the floor with her feet.

185
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:08.540
The theater was literally literally rocking. I mean, it was moving.

186
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.760
<v 1>I've seen the power of this film firsthand.</v>

187
00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.700
I recommended it to a friend who ended up loving it so much.

188
00:10:13.701 --> 00:10:17.690
She got a tattoo of violet on her arm. She even included a labyrinth.

189
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.860
The same object Corky has tattooed on her arm, which symbolizes the matriarchy.

190
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:25.880
The symbol suits this film quite well because Corky and violet both overcome the

191
00:10:25.881 --> 00:10:28.970
usual boundaries set on women in the war and gangster films.

192
00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:32.780
Corky crosses that boundary by playing a role typically given to a man and

193
00:10:32.781 --> 00:10:37.010
violet crosses that boundary by defying the expectations of the femme fatale.

194
00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.660
<v 3>It's got stacks of letters from fans all over the country saying it is so great</v>

195
00:10:41.661 --> 00:10:44.930
to see a woman who they think she's going to be the photographer and they think

196
00:10:44.931 --> 00:10:46.790
she's going to be Trey and let go.

197
00:10:46.791 --> 00:10:50.480
And she ends up being so competent and so real and so reliable.

198
00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.460
You never get to see a reliable fam in this kind of movie. So it was just,

199
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.290
it was a great day for womankind.

200
00:10:58.730 --> 00:10:58.760
<v 1>Found,</v>

201
00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.910
just goes to show that you don't need to sacrifice the thrills of a genre film

202
00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:05.630
to include women and LGBT people in your story. On the contrary,

203
00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.960
those identities can make your film more interesting because they give the

204
00:11:08.961 --> 00:11:13.010
filmmaker an opportunity to push the boundaries of what could happen in a Nawara

205
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:16.580
gangster or heist film, who bound challenges,

206
00:11:16.581 --> 00:11:18.410
the established rules of genre films.

207
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.010
So it's no surprise that the film itself is about breaking rules and crossing

208
00:11:22.011 --> 00:11:22.700
boundaries.

209
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.480
In the film Caesar tries to create boundaries by preventing things from entering

210
00:11:26.481 --> 00:11:27.770
and exiting his apartment.

211
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.200
He doesn't let violet leave while they torture Shelly.

212
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:33.560
And he tries to keep Johnny quiet, to prevent sound from escaping,

213
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:37.550
making too much noise. He even attempts to control Corky early on.

214
00:11:37.551 --> 00:11:41.090
He forces her to accept some money so he can keep her under his thumb.

215
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.900
But despite all his best efforts, the boundaries of his apartment are fluid.

216
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:46.640
Corky can hear through the walls.

217
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.310
And violet allows her to enter and exit freely.

218
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.790
One of the coolest examples of fluid boundaries is when violin and Corky make

219
00:11:52.791 --> 00:11:56.890
their to steal the mafia's money. And instead of cutting between two locations,

220
00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.880
Corky appears like an apparition in Violet's apartment to talk through the plan,

221
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:02.350
come to a place in the morning.

222
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.580
So it's only appropriate that Caesar realizes something is up by hearing a phone

223
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.660
ring through his walls.

224
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:11.320
He gets a literal wake-up call that the boundaries of his apartment aren't as

225
00:12:11.321 --> 00:12:12.490
secure as he thought,

226
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:15.730
but the boundaries don't stop violent and Corky even with a wall,

227
00:12:15.731 --> 00:12:17.590
separating them. They still connect

228
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:25.090
In the end, the use of genre, the characters and the story all cross boundaries.

229
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.520
So if you're wondering why the film is called bound,

230
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.480
that's why the title of the film does a great job of showing the multiple ideas

231
00:12:31.481 --> 00:12:32.470
expressed in the film.

232
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.760
The most obvious meaning of bound is to be restricted like when Corky is bound

233
00:12:36.761 --> 00:12:38.500
by rope in the opening of the film,

234
00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.980
but the promotional art for the film clearly shows that being bound with rope

235
00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:46.450
also has sexual connotations echoing the non-traditional lesbian relationship at

236
00:12:46.451 --> 00:12:47.530
the center of the story.

237
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:51.520
But if you want to go even deeper bounds also means certain to do something

238
00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:55.060
quirky and violet are bound to escape their predicaments and follow their

239
00:12:55.061 --> 00:12:58.930
destiny. And this is a story,

240
00:12:58.931 --> 00:13:00.520
not bound to genre rules,

241
00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:04.150
and also not bound to conventional sexual and gender identities.

242
00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:06.850
And even though a child skis themselves have crossed boundaries,

243
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.780
years after bound came out, both which housekeepers came out as trans women,

244
00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:14.290
which adds another layer of meaning to their early work with their coming out as

245
00:13:14.291 --> 00:13:15.160
trans bounces,

246
00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:19.600
positive representation of the LGBT community feels that much more personal.

247
00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.890
And like the matrix, both films deserve close readings with a transgender lens.

248
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:24.581
For example,

249
00:13:24.581 --> 00:13:28.540
both films have a moment where one person thinks another character is a man,

250
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:32.140
but that character is actually a woman in the matrix. Neo assumes.

251
00:13:32.141 --> 00:13:33.550
Trinity will be a man.

252
00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:38.040
<v 0>I just thought you were a guy.</v>

253
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:41.670
<v 1>And inbound Caesar assumes violet is hooking up with a guy,</v>

254
00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:43.260
but it turns out she's with a woman.

255
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:48.263
<v 0>Dark.</v>

256
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.160
<v 1>In so many ways the which house keys,</v>

257
00:13:50.161 --> 00:13:53.640
Susie bright and the rest of the production team made a film that escaped the

258
00:13:53.641 --> 00:13:57.360
bounds of what a genre movie can be. So if you haven't watched this film,

259
00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:00.870
all I ask is that you give it a shot because I have a feeling you'll enjoy

260
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.540
watching the greatest lesbian gangster heist movie.

261
00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:09.803
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

262
00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:14.250
<v 1>The which house keys.</v>

263
00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:17.910
First director of photography for bound actually dropped out because he didn't

264
00:14:17.911 --> 00:14:20.460
think he could make their film with their budget in the end,

265
00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:24.570
bill Pope signed on and helped them execute their vision on a shoestring budget.

266
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.510
<v 0>Great movie made for nothing. That to me is a perfect little gym.</v>

267
00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:28.231
<v 1>These days,</v>

268
00:14:28.231 --> 00:14:31.800
you don't need an agent or production company to learn how to shoot video on a

269
00:14:31.801 --> 00:14:33.210
lower budget to do that.

270
00:14:33.211 --> 00:14:35.970
You can watch Christopher road's class on that exact topic,

271
