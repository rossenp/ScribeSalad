1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.030
<v 0>Civilizations have used the colors,</v>

2
00:00:03.031 --> 00:00:06.390
black and white in their stories to represent good and evil throughout human

3
00:00:06.391 --> 00:00:10.260
history. The Bible tells us black is evil and white is good. On the first page.

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.750
In the beginning, there was only darkness. And then God said,

5
00:00:12.751 --> 00:00:13.590
let there be lights.

6
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:16.380
And he saw that the light was good cultures across the world,

7
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.670
associate black with evil death and the devil and to white with purity life and

8
00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:21.090
heaven.

9
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.050
So it's no surprise that a black cat means bad luck and angels were white.

10
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.850
Since film began in black and white,

11
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:30.420
the medium works well for black and white dualism with such a strong cultural

12
00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:31.110
foundation.

13
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.740
Filmmakers could easily give cues about a character based on their blackness or

14
00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:35.574
whiteness.

15
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.880
<v 1>In the song.</v>

16
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.000
<v 0>The appeal of black and white symbolism is that it's easy to grasp the</v>

17
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:46.820
distinction between two extremes with this binary.

18
00:00:46.821 --> 00:00:50.390
There's literally no gray area starting with the great train robbery,

19
00:00:50.391 --> 00:00:53.870
Western films and cereals used to the simplicity to their advantage.

20
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.260
Black and white hats are an easy way to tell who's the good guy and who's the

21
00:00:57.261 --> 00:00:57.890
bad guy.

22
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.280
And this tradition continues in modern filmmaking where it seems like every

23
00:01:01.281 --> 00:01:05.360
major franchise has incorporated the symbolism in some way in the same way that

24
00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:08.720
black and white symbolism creates a simpler and clearer metaphor.

25
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.020
Black and white filmmaking creates a simpler and clearer image.

26
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.230
<v 2>The black and white is often actually preferable to color,</v>

27
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.550
especially in movies where movement and timing and atmosphere are more important

28
00:01:19.551 --> 00:01:23.480
than pretty pictures or landscapes color can add too much information to a

29
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.750
scene.

30
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.470
<v 0>The simplicity of black and white film making and black and white imagery makes</v>

31
00:01:27.471 --> 00:01:30.800
it an enticing tool for filmmakers, even while shooting in color,

32
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.610
despite the opportunity to use color modern directors like David Fincher and

33
00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:38.540
Christopher Nolan often choose de-saturated pallets that look almost black and

34
00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:38.990
white.

35
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.040
This choice adds a visual clarity to their scenes by creating a simpler image.

36
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.760
Desaturation is a trend that extends beyond just Fincher and Nolan.

37
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.390
It seems like whenever a filmmaker wants to convey realism, normality,

38
00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:53.750
or a sense of familiarity, they choose a less colorful palette.

39
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.380
Many critics defend black and white filmmaking as superior Pierce.

40
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.620
<v 2>Cinema. And in fact, I think parents almost ought to take kids and say, Hey,</v>

41
00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:00.831
look,

42
00:02:00.831 --> 00:02:04.370
this is another way that movies used to be made in it's part of your cultural

43
00:02:04.371 --> 00:02:05.270
heritage that I do.

44
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.840
<v 0>Cultural heritage. Is he talking about the birth of a nation?</v>

45
00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:12.800
Very clearly exposes the racial undertones associated with black and white

46
00:02:12.801 --> 00:02:14.270
symbolism. In this film,

47
00:02:14.271 --> 00:02:18.920
a white actor uses blackface to show he's supposedly evil and to the KKK dress

48
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.580
and white to show. They are supposedly the heroes, not only was this film,

49
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.150
a massive commercial success and a huge influence on modern cinema,

50
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.720
but it also was partially responsible for the rebirth of the Klu Klux Klan.

51
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.740
The use of black and white symbolism implies a racial binary with whiteness

52
00:02:33.741 --> 00:02:36.980
being inherently good and blackness being inherently evil,

53
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.940
but many filmmakers challenge that binary in two important ways first by

54
00:02:40.941 --> 00:02:44.540
flipping the associations of black and white and second by injecting that

55
00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:46.730
familiar binary with something else entirely.

56
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.540
So when does black and white not feel familiar?

57
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.393
<v 1>I gotta get out of here.</v>

58
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.940
<v 0>The classic interpretation of black and white symbolism makes those colors feel,</v>

59
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.280
but sometimes filmmakers exaggerate the colors to the point that they no longer

60
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:06.970
have that classic association with good evil, such a strong contrast.

61
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.360
Then it feels uncomfortable to the eye over doing black and white to the point

62
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:13.120
of unease has a long history in literature in Moby.

63
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:16.720
Dick Ishmael feels intimidated by the color of the whale saying it was the

64
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:20.080
whiteness of the whale that above all things appalls me for Melville.

65
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.830
There's an apparent terror to the uniformity of pure white objects that are

66
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:27.820
purely black and white are simple to a fault and feel a little suspicious after

67
00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:30.580
all. How can something natural be that lacking of color?

68
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.920
Moby Dick is an early example of challenging.

69
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.880
Whether something white is automatically good and some movies use completely

70
00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:38.830
white things in the exact same way.

71
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.240
Rabbits they're supposed to be cute on paper. They're adorable,

72
00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:45.940
lovable animals. Have you ever gotten close to a rabbit?

73
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.450
You can tell in their eyes, they have the brain of, of like a sociopath.

74
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.650
You put a rabbit brain and a human body. You have Michael Myers,

75
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.360
the killer in American psycho.

76
00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:59.050
The set designer purposefully made Bateman's apartment to white to make it

77
00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:00.070
uneasy to the eye.

78
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.980
When the realtor repaints Paul Allen's apartment to completely white,

79
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.330
the color feels nauseated.

80
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.060
<v 3>Don't make any trouble, please. I suggest you go.</v>

81
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.190
<v 0>In the same way that B's films, challenged black and white symbolism.</v>

82
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.870
Other films shot in color challenge.

83
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.660
The suppose that familiarity of black and white images,

84
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.200
the first time most famous example is the wizard of Oz where Dorothy escapes the

85
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.080
Dole world of Kansas and falls into the colorful Oz,

86
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.730
even such an early color film,

87
00:04:29.731 --> 00:04:33.300
portrayed black and white as a place that a character might not feel comfortable

88
00:04:33.301 --> 00:04:37.050
in. Dorothy escapes the restrictions of black and white in favor of the colorful

89
00:04:37.051 --> 00:04:38.940
world of possibilities in us.

90
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.330
But the film makes sure not to go too far with the metaphor because in the end,

91
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.690
Dorothy, happily returns home to her familiar black and white life.

92
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.170
But the satire Pleasantville use the same metaphor to full effect.

93
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.950
The film follows a brother and sister who gets trapped in a 1950 sitcom called

94
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:53.640
Pleasantville.

95
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.090
The fictional show echoes other popular sitcoms at the time that started a

96
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.320
typical American family and the town is ordinary to a fault. It has no toilets,

97
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.200
it never rains. And everybody always follows the rules.

98
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.530
It's a weird day to this place gives me the creeps as the brother and sister

99
00:05:07.531 --> 00:05:10.320
teach the town to break their old fashioned moral codes.

100
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.710
The town slowly gains color in response, the mayor Outlaws it.

101
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.310
He literally bands colored people from entering certain establishments.

102
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.980
This film shows how black and white can feel to normal.

103
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.080
So put together that it feels unnatural.

104
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.070
It also shows how black and white represents a traditional past specifically a

105
00:05:26.071 --> 00:05:29.940
past that excluded colorful thinking and literally colorful people.

106
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.390
It's a question of whether we want to hold onto those values that made this

107
00:05:33.391 --> 00:05:37.650
place great. Another unsettling part of Pleasantville is the lack of color.

108
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.100
And it's casting the fact that there's no non-white residents adds to the

109
00:05:41.101 --> 00:05:43.770
homogeneity of the town and to the residents within it.

110
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.160
We see the same creepy homogenity throughout American psycho,

111
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.230
where characters have identical business cards,

112
00:05:49.231 --> 00:05:51.540
aside from a slightly different shade of white.

113
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.520
<v 3>Look at that subtle off white coloring, a tasteful thickness on that.</v>

114
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.250
Patrick Bateman obsesses.

115
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.760
<v 0>Over white because he wants to conform not because he cares about purity</v>

116
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.830
innocence or the idea of being good.

117
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.590
<v 1>I see why you're still quit because I want to fit</v>

118
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.993
in.

119
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.270
<v 0>But the obsession with fitting perfectly into this mold brings Bateman no</v>

120
00:06:13.271 --> 00:06:16.480
satisfaction. In his case, white represents payments, derangement,

121
00:06:16.481 --> 00:06:20.050
and obsession with power as a result of his hyper-masculine white elite

122
00:06:20.051 --> 00:06:23.950
environment. Mid-summer I film shot almost entirely in the middle of the day.

123
00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.800
Also disrupts classic notions of light and whiteness.

124
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.060
When the movie first came out,

125
00:06:28.061 --> 00:06:31.840
critics praised it as a daylight horror film that subverted horror trucks by

126
00:06:31.841 --> 00:06:36.070
dispelling the idea that darkness is the only way to create an unsettling tone.

127
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.120
In fact, the movies,

128
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.360
grim events feel more disturbing because they play out in broad daylight with

129
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.160
all the characters wearing white all,

130
00:06:42.161 --> 00:06:45.880
but one main character suffers a violent end at the hands of a white Nordic

131
00:06:45.881 --> 00:06:50.290
tribe that wears mostly all white worships light and holds an annual ritual to

132
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.520
ward off the black one.

133
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.150
Despite the fact that the film intentionally flips the horror genre on its head,

134
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.480
they kept one glaring horror trope. The black guy dies first.

135
00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:02.710
It's an oversight that comes as a surprise in such an otherwise subversive film.

136
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.850
And it plays into racial tropes about black characters being more expendable,

137
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.000
but his death also plays into the cruelty of the white characters.

138
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.320
So the trope simultaneously reinforces data, black stereotypes and questions,

139
00:07:14.321 --> 00:07:15.910
existing white stereotypes.

140
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.210
Ultimately when filmmakers disrupt classic notions of black and white,

141
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.020
they create new possibilities around to exactly the hero and the villain of the

142
00:07:23.021 --> 00:07:25.390
story can be HBO's Watchman employs,

143
00:07:25.391 --> 00:07:29.200
subversive black and white symbolism to critique our concept of heroism,

144
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.860
the main character, Angela ABAR sports, an all black outfit. At first,

145
00:07:32.861 --> 00:07:35.020
it's unclear whether she's a villain or a hero.

146
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.500
She plays a cop that fights crime as part of a questionably good police force

147
00:07:38.501 --> 00:07:39.490
full of superheroes,

148
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.360
which she quickly finds out is run by the KKK and her own crime fighting

149
00:07:43.361 --> 00:07:47.650
grandfather was himself inspired by the black Western hero bass Reeves who wears

150
00:07:47.651 --> 00:07:49.990
an all black outfit down to the black hat.

151
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.650
Perhaps the most impactful use of black and white and Watchman is the episode.

152
00:07:53.651 --> 00:07:56.980
This extraordinary being in which Angela relives the memories of her

153
00:07:56.981 --> 00:07:59.740
grandfather. The entire episode is shot in black and white.

154
00:07:59.741 --> 00:08:03.430
And similarly to Pleasantville this episode denotes a serious shift in tone,

155
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.640
rather than a gleeful and familiar nod to the good old days.

156
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.300
This shifts to an entirely black and white palette is accompanied by intense

157
00:08:10.301 --> 00:08:13.390
music and a horrific series of violent racial events.

158
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.870
This episode serves as a modern retelling of the birth of a nation put at

159
00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:17.231
justice,

160
00:08:17.231 --> 00:08:20.890
adopts his costume after being lynched with a black bag and new surround his

161
00:08:20.891 --> 00:08:21.220
head,

162
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.480
fashions it into a Cape and becomes a dark figured hero that fights off KKK

163
00:08:25.481 --> 00:08:26.710
members in white hoods,

164
00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:30.670
put it justice takes the racial binary and literally fashions it into something

165
00:08:30.671 --> 00:08:34.480
new Watchman perfectly captures an inversion of black and white symbolism and

166
00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:36.970
imagery to disrupt and question the status quo.

167
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.390
So many filmmakers challenged the binary of black and white by using those

168
00:08:40.391 --> 00:08:43.810
colors in non-traditional ways to contradict their association with good and

169
00:08:43.811 --> 00:08:44.140
evil.

170
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.710
But films also have another way to challenge the binary of black and white.

171
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:49.293
<v 1>Color.</v>

172
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.500
<v 0>Of course, colors have many different meanings themselves,</v>

173
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.570
but when you used indirect contrast a black and white binary color can alarm

174
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.590
challenge and disrupt an image. Venture does prefer a monochromatic image,

175
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.400
but he actually does use color strategically to give visual cues in seven.

176
00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:08.100
The only character wearing striking colors is John DOE.

177
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.930
His red jumpsuit stands out in scenes,

178
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.660
otherwise dominated by dark and earthy tones.

179
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.090
His colorful outfit creates tension in a world to that.

180
00:09:15.091 --> 00:09:19.110
Previously had very little color. We immediately recognize him as an outsider,

181
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.020
giving his scenes a sense of unease that would not have been present.

182
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.410
Had he fit the overall color scheme and in the girl with the dragon tattoo,

183
00:09:25.411 --> 00:09:28.770
the colorful tools in the background to create an ominous atmosphere because the

184
00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:32.730
neon orange catches our eye. And we realize what those tools are for Fincher,

185
00:09:32.731 --> 00:09:36.660
mostly uses neutral tones to create a pleasant image that LOLs the viewer into a

186
00:09:36.661 --> 00:09:40.320
sense of normalcy. When he occasionally disrupts that normalcy with color,

187
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.310
the effect alerts,

188
00:09:41.311 --> 00:09:45.030
the viewer of characters that threatened the visual status quo Fincher plays on

189
00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:48.900
our comfort and familiarity with black and white imagery to create visual drama

190
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:50.430
and fear within his scenes.

191
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:53.790
It's so effective because color has often been used to represent the foreign

192
00:09:53.791 --> 00:09:58.110
entity alien Dorothy's world is quite literally disrupted by color in the form

193
00:09:58.111 --> 00:10:02.460
of the land of hos colors association with foreign or even alien landscapes is a

194
00:10:02.461 --> 00:10:06.210
common trope compare Marvel film set on earth to the one sentence space

195
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.170
filmmakers understand that color is often associated with something unfamiliar.

196
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:14.010
Annihilation takes this unfamiliarity to the extreme in this film color is not

197
00:10:14.011 --> 00:10:15.960
just unfamiliar. It's terrifying.

198
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.490
The central antagonism in the film is represented visually by intense color.

199
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.450
The landscapes within the shimmer are lit by an unnatural rainbow refraction.

200
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:28.560
And it actually mutates by making things impossibly, coloring lignin.

201
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:30.900
<v 3>Tumors.</v>

202
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.510
<v 0>With this disruption, going down to the molecular level,</v>

203
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.820
contrast the shimmer with the scenes outside of it.

204
00:10:35.821 --> 00:10:39.030
And they look just like Fincher's films, mostly grazing whites.

205
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.720
The shimmer works as an antagonism because it plays on our discomfort with

206
00:10:42.721 --> 00:10:45.840
color. It represents an alien change that makes us uneasy.

207
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.200
The film depicts the foreboding infection of color into an otherwise color of

208
00:10:49.201 --> 00:10:49.770
this world.

209
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:53.280
These films reinforced the idea that black and white is natural and comfortable

210
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.110
color. Only disrupts the image in some way.

211
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:56.390
<v 3>You and me tofu.</v>

212
00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:00.950
We don't do lollipops and rainbows because we know those are pretty colors.

213
00:11:00.951 --> 00:11:02.900
They just hide what the world really is.

214
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.040
<v 0>But doesn't that sell color short,</v>

215
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.940
many black filmmakers embrace color in their films and reject the tradition of

216
00:11:10.941 --> 00:11:14.390
black and white early cinema developed lighting techniques for white faces

217
00:11:14.391 --> 00:11:16.010
within black and white color schemes.

218
00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:19.550
But those white centric techniques were developed at the expense of darker skin

219
00:11:19.551 --> 00:11:20.030
tones.

220
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:23.510
When comparing the lighting of black faces in black and white films with modern

221
00:11:23.511 --> 00:11:26.900
films like Moonlight and black clansmen, it's clear that color lights,

222
00:11:26.901 --> 00:11:27.920
black faces better.

223
00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:31.790
Some also reject black and white for symbolic reasons for some black and white

224
00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:34.790
films represent a time they were excluded or marginalized,

225
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.120
which explains why many black filmmakers actually use more color to denote

226
00:11:38.121 --> 00:11:39.080
events in the past.

227
00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.620
Sorry to bother you perfectly summarizes what black and white movies can't do.

228
00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:45.950
It's a complete reversal of movies like the birth of a nation instead of a white

229
00:11:45.951 --> 00:11:49.430
people, pretending to be black. It's about black people pretending to be white.

230
00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.730
And it reverses the idea that color feels uncomfortable and black and white

231
00:11:54.731 --> 00:11:55.380
feels natural.

232
00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:59.850
<v 4>You know, 35% of men who wear pink are more likely to start a franchise.</v>

233
00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:01.830
<v 0>As Cassius gains wealth and status.</v>

234
00:12:01.831 --> 00:12:04.350
He moves to an apartment that looks exactly like Patrick,

235
00:12:04.351 --> 00:12:06.240
Bateman's completely lacking in color,

236
00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:09.570
but there is one colorful item that stands out the photo of his father,

237
00:12:09.571 --> 00:12:11.220
which changes as he sells out,

238
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.770
showing his father's disapproval of the de-saturated life.

239
00:12:13.771 --> 00:12:14.850
Cassius has chosen for him.

240
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:18.540
<v 4>It's one thing to take the promotion, but now you are a full-out scab.</v>

241
00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:22.320
<v 0>In this film color represents authenticity and staying true to your identity.</v>

242
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.990
It makes sense that black filmmakers have an affinity for color,

243
00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.610
both aesthetically and thematically,

244
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:30.300
black and white symbolism and film have their place at the movies and black and

245
00:12:30.301 --> 00:12:33.480
white does create beautiful images, but it has its limitations.

246
00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:37.110
Not only does this paradigm simplify our thinking and literally simplify the

247
00:12:37.111 --> 00:12:37.740
film image,

248
00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.680
but that simplification has historically been at the expense of people,

249
00:12:40.681 --> 00:12:43.710
not a part of the status quo, but with colorful filmmaking,

250
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.500
it's not so easy to villainize some and to worship others.

251
00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:50.340
So I am grateful for film shot in color because in the end it's not also black

252
00:12:50.341 --> 00:12:51.174
and white

253
00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.340
color is an excellent visual tool to illustrate the complexity, depth,

254
00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:00.570
and humanity of life films like annihilation to this marvelously by using color

255
00:13:00.571 --> 00:13:03.480
to demonstrate that nature is not only in chanting Lee, beautiful,

256
00:13:03.481 --> 00:13:06.240
but also dangerously complex and full of patterns.

257
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.780
It's no wonder that nature documentaries like planet earth and blue planet are

258
00:13:09.781 --> 00:13:12.150
shot in high definition with saturated colors,

259
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.960
the documentary nature's mathematics actually explores the core ideas that

260
00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:19.650
annihilation is based on by using mathematics to understand nature's inherent

261
00:13:19.651 --> 00:13:22.680
patterns. And with curiosity, stream's newly expanded library.

262
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:26.070
You can watch nature's mathematics and thousands of other documentary titles

263
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:30.060
that use vibrant color to understand nature's mysteries CuriosityStream is a

264

subscription-based video service with big budget non-fiction films,

265
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.660
but they've also partnered with Nebula, a creator owned streaming service.

266
00:13:36.661 --> 00:13:38.850
That's built by content creators, just like me.
