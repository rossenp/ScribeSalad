like many other franchises and ensemble films.

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.780
The X-Men series had the challenge of juggling several character arcs while

5
00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:16.590
still maintaining a story that spans over multiple films. In fact,

6
00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:20.310
the biggest influence on the X-Men sequel [inaudible] was another SQL from

7
00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:22.740
another huge franchise. You may have heard of it.

8
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.770
The production team referred to X two as the X men equivalent to the star Wars

9
00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:30.240
sequel, the empire strikes back.

10
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.420
Both films made established characters split apart and come to their own

11
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:37.500
realizations X two effectively adapted this concept for its own characters,

12
00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:41.100
film and film series, and the scene that best captures how the film executes.

13
00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:45.030
This idea is one exceed here and the X-Men infiltrate the oval office to warn

14
00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:47.700
the president of the coming war. In the third X-Men film.

15
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.600
The scene takes place after Stryker tried to brainwash Xavier and to using his

16
00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:53.160
powers to wipe out all mutants.

17
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.550
Xavier tells the president what happened and reminds him that the mutants aren't

18
00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:58.020
going anywhere and in the future,

19
00:00:58.021 --> 00:01:00.690
humans and mutants need to work together to bring peace.

20
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.100
<v 1>Mr. President, the next move is yours.</v>

21
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.420
<v 0>At first glance. The scene may seem like just an easy way to set up the SQL,</v>

22
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.850
but it's actually packed with an impressive amount of depth,

23
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.390
finishing up several character arcs and summing up the movie itself all while

24
00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:15.200
looking awesome.

25
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.440
So let's take a look at how this excellent scene gives closure to the struggles

26
00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:22.190
of multiple characters in the film and addresses the main theme of the entire

27
00:01:22.191 --> 00:01:23.210
X-Men franchise.

28
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.660
<v 1>This time of adversity, we are being offered in moments.</v>

29
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.810
<v 0>Before we even see any X-Men in this scene,</v>

30
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.450
we get hints that multiple mutants are about to show up.

31
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.740
First, we see lightning and hear thunder,

32
00:01:36.741 --> 00:01:39.080
and we instantly know it's not just bad weather.

33
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.610
It's the mutans storm storms powers always signal her arrival before we see her.

34
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.700
And it reminds us of an earlier moment in the film when she did the exact same

35
00:01:46.701 --> 00:01:49.910
thing, then the president notices everyone is frozen in place.

36
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.070
So we now know Xavier is involved too,

37
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.310
because everybody freezing reminds the viewer of a similar moment in the

38
00:01:55.311 --> 00:01:57.890
beginning of the film. So before we even see the mutans,

39
00:01:57.891 --> 00:01:59.210
the visuals of the scene, prime,

40
00:01:59.211 --> 00:02:02.450
the viewer for the Epic payoff of the team appearing in the oval office.

41
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:10.100
<v 1>Good morning, Mr. Perez.</v>

42
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.030
<v 0>And the combination of freezing characters and using lightning creates an</v>

43
00:02:14.031 --> 00:02:17.090
amazing image, but the final scene goes beyond cool visuals.

44
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.260
The dialogue is actually extremely multilayer for such a seemingly simple scene.

45
00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:24.710
It's filled with character pails that neatly tie up the events of the film for

46
00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:27.350
Logan. Xavier speech makes him empathize with Cyclops.

47
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.240
<v 1>And there have been casualties losses on both sides.</v>

48
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.390
<v 0>And they sort of come to terms with each other in the next scene.</v>

49
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.570
And he also got another more subtle moment throughout the film.

50
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.880
There's a recurring theme that Logan abandons people.

51
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.750
<v 1>You'll be here when we get back, unless you plan on running off again,</v>

52
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.220
I can be the good guy, good guy sticks around.

53
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.590
<v 0>And he later fulfills this prophecy where's Logan.</v>

54
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.040
<v 1>But in the end.</v>

55
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.890
<v 0>He rejects that past self and embraces his role in the X-Men.</v>

56
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.740
By the time he's at the white house, he completes this character arc.

57
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:07.360
When he gets aligned, saying, he'll stick around.

58
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.573
<v 1>We'll be watching.</v>

59
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.850
<v 0>Similarly Xavier's dialogue also calls back to his actions in the film in this</v>

60
00:03:14.851 --> 00:03:15.121
scene,

61
00:03:15.121 --> 00:03:18.660
the X-Men give the president files that show Stryker was trying to kill all the

62
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.620
mutants.

63
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.530
<v 1>How'd you get this? Well, that's just say,</v>

64
00:03:22.531 --> 00:03:24.600
I know a little girl who can walk through walls.

65
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.850
<v 0>With such a diverse group of superheroes.</v>

66
00:03:26.851 --> 00:03:29.430
There were tons of ways for saving your ticket. Those files.

67
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.610
I think the writers wanted [inaudible] to have the little girl from his school,

68
00:03:32.611 --> 00:03:35.250
get the files because it reminds us of earlier in the film,

69
00:03:35.251 --> 00:03:39.000
when Jason Stryker used an illusion of a little girl to mind control Xavier,

70
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.080
the film even refers to both the illusion and the actual student as a little

71
00:03:43.081 --> 00:03:44.040
girl, she's just.

72
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.093
<v 1>No, she's not.</v>

73
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.840
<v 0>Like many other X-Men movies.</v>

74
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.650
Xavier's character arc revolves around his ability to nurture younger mutants

75
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.910
and to, because he gets captured,

76
00:03:53.911 --> 00:03:56.100
he's unable to protect his students from the government.

77
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.941
<v 1>But now,</v>

78
00:03:56.941 --> 00:04:01.680
and then every mother needs to get away without her babies are

79
00:04:01.681 --> 00:04:02.514
helpless.

80
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.500
<v 0>Mind controls it. Xavier is a former student who'd saved your failed to save.</v>

81
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.250
Jason's a living example of Xavier's fear that he won't be able to help his

82
00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.840
students. At this point in the movie,

83
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.900
Xavier can't protect them and he can't use them to do good.

84
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.870
It's actually turned into the opposite. Instead of mentoring students,

85
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.140
a student now mentors, him giving him instructions on what to do.

86
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.620
The whole scene puts it Xavier at his lowest harming mutants instead of

87
00:04:25.621 --> 00:04:29.040
mentoring them. But once he's at the white house, he has repaired his mentor,

88
00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:30.150
student relationships.

89
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.810
He now mentors a little girl from his school to use her powers for the greater

90
00:04:33.811 --> 00:04:34.470
good.

91
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.380
<v 1>Did you get this? Well, let's just say,</v>

92
00:04:37.381 --> 00:04:39.600
I know a little girl who can walk through walls.

93
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.690
<v 0>By connecting the Allusionist and this scene with a similar character.</v>

94
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.380
A dialogue shows Xavier has moved on from his failures as a teacher and has

95
00:04:46.381 --> 00:04:49.830
resumed his role as a caring mentor. And even without any dialogue,

96
00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:52.050
the other characters in the scene get their own moments.

97
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.350
Earlier in the film are Rogen Iceman, both wanted superhero uniform.

98
00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.600
<v 1>Why did we get uniforms around order should arrive in a few years.</v>

99
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.680
<v 0>And by the final scene,</v>

100
00:05:01.681 --> 00:05:04.410
they've already got them showing that they've proved themselves as X-Men.

101
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.440
And it's cool to have Nightcrawler back in the oval office because it reminds us

102
00:05:07.441 --> 00:05:10.200
of the opening of the film when he acted much differently there,

103
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.530
his small back and forth with the president in this scene reminds us that his

104
00:05:13.531 --> 00:05:17.070
character was nothing like the menacing monster from the opening scene in a way,

105
00:05:17.071 --> 00:05:20.160
he gets a small bit of redemption by showing the president his true self,

106
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.240
just like with Logan,

107
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.990
Xavier rogue and Iceman Nightcrawler got a moment in this scene to show his

108
00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:25.824
transformation.

109
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.950
Mike crawlers redemption in the white house signals some broader payoffs in the

110
00:05:28.951 --> 00:05:29.940
story. As a whole,

111
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.330
the film begins with a mutant creating chaos in a United States government

112
00:05:33.331 --> 00:05:36.900
building initiating the tenuous relationship between the mutes and community and

113
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.440
the government in direct contrast to the chaos of the first scene in the white

114
00:05:40.441 --> 00:05:41.220
house. This one,

115
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.460
it feels methodical and exact instead of the camera whipping around in

116
00:05:44.461 --> 00:05:46.740
confusion. It moves slowly into with purpose.

117
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.830
And instead of everyone being thrown around, they are perfectly still.

118
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.860
It brings a sense of conclusion to the tension in the very beginning,

119
00:05:52.861 --> 00:05:54.300
that set off the plot of the film,

120
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.940
but this scene goes even deeper than just this one movie,

121
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.920
the entire franchise of X-Men deals with one central question,

122
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.380
should mutants work with humans or fight against them.

123
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.550
This scene shows a little bit of both Xavier trust, humanity, more than Magneto.

124
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.980
That was the central disagreement of the first X-Men film.

125
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.420
But after the events of this movie,

126
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.360
Xavier has clearly seen the potential danger of the government,

127
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:17.150
knowing the whereabouts of every mutant. When given the option,

128
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:20.780
the government lets or try to destroy all mutans and that event changed.

129
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.030
ex-Navy your strategy towards dealing with humans.

130
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.210
You can see his transformation when comparing the white house scene with the

131
00:06:26.211 --> 00:06:29.180
other timing. Xavier froze humans in that earlier scene.

132
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:31.550
He freezes to stop mutans from using their powers.

133
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.320
<v 1>And the next time you feel like showing off don't.</v>

134
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.200
<v 0>This time, he lets the presidency their power.</v>

135
00:06:38.201 --> 00:06:40.570
So ex-Navy your consent a message. So in this scene,

136
00:06:40.571 --> 00:06:42.430
the mutans act a little more like Magneto.

137
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.980
They do show what they're capable of in an intimidating way,

138
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.350
but they still make it clear that they want to use that power.

139
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.100
<v 1>Mr. President, this is not a threat. This is an opportunity.</v>

140
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:52.720
<v 0>In a first for the franchise.</v>

141
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.230
Xavier no longer completely relies on the Goodwill of politicians.

142
00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.210
This time he extends an olive branch,

143
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.550
but he also makes sure that the president knows the mutants.

144
00:07:00.551 --> 00:07:01.600
Won't go down without a fight.

145
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.980
<v 1>We're here to stay. Mr. President, the next move is yours.</v>

146
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.550
<v 0>Because this scene wrap-up the arcs of individual characters,</v>

147
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.520
but it also wraps up the collective arc of all the mutants,

148
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.730
both in this film and in the film series up to this point,

149
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:17.110
through their collective struggles,

150
00:07:17.111 --> 00:07:20.380
the mutans learned to no longer hide in the shadows and instead to use their

151
00:07:20.381 --> 00:07:23.740
power for the betterment of themselves, their entire race and humanity.

152
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.980
And after looking at this scene closely,

153
00:07:26.981 --> 00:07:30.130
the influences from the empire strikes back become perfectly clear.

154
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.610
Both films have characters who mature a new cast member who gains the trust of

155
00:07:33.611 --> 00:07:36.250
the group and a mix of uncertainty and hope at the end,

156
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.640
the facts that both these films used a very similar tropes to tell such

157
00:07:39.641 --> 00:07:42.880
different stories, shows the brilliance behind this narrative structure.

158
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.270
They both set up the conflict to give characters their own personal struggles

159
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.870
and then reunite those characters to fill their individual arcs and bring the

160
00:07:49.871 --> 00:07:52.660
entire story to net an X, to manage to back.

161
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:56.740
A lot of that payoff all at once in one excellent scene, many blockbusters,

162
00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.240
including other X-Men films,

163
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.450
set up a SQL by sticking a small teaser into the post credits.

164
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.720
But in this scene X to not only laid the groundwork for a SQL,

165
00:08:04.721 --> 00:08:08.530
but also perfectly wrapped with the conflicts within the characters and the film

166
00:08:08.531 --> 00:08:10.840
itself, based on the presentation of this scene,

167
00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:14.530
it's no surprise that the original X-Men series easily managed storylines for

168
00:08:14.531 --> 00:08:17.950
many characters at once and set the standard for world-building and a large

169
00:08:17.951 --> 00:08:19.000
cinematic universe.

170
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:25.810
This video is part of the one excellent scene series about the X-Men film

171
00:08:25.811 --> 00:08:27.760
franchise. We all hand picked a scene.

172
00:08:27.761 --> 00:08:30.400
We love from the accident to show what makes these films great.

173
00:08:30.401 --> 00:08:32.800
And for a similar, personal curated experience,

174
00:08:32.801 --> 00:08:34.690
when it comes to exploring more films,

175
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.470
I highly recommend movie movie is a curated streaming service that shows

176
00:08:38.471 --> 00:08:40.450
exceptional films from around the world.

177
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.140

178
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.120
hand selected by their team of curators.

179
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.160
So you'll always have something great to watch.

They have tons of timeless classics,

181
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:53.980
award-winning masterpieces and festival fresh jets, the kinds of films.

182
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:58.230
I definitely want to watching Maura to start. I'd recommend watching June noon,

183
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.190
a fascinating documentary directed by Paul Thomas Anderson about the making of

184
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:05.130
the album. June noon, inside of a giant Ford in India,
