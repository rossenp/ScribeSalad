00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.020
<v 0>Some say that a movie gets made three times once when it's written again,</v>

2
00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:05.940
when it's shot and finally when it's edited,

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.450
but sometimes it feels like we overvalue the first two steps and undervalued the

4
00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:13.380
last one in film criticism, we seem to focus more on the writers and directors,

5
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.870
and we especially love it when one person does both,

6
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.940
but that still leaves out one third of the story.

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.500
And this phenomenon is nothing new

8
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.390
editors weren't even given credit for their work and early silent films.

9
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.410
Back then people saw cutting film as a menial job that required no creativity as

10
00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:32.730
a result. It was labeled as a job suitable for women and by extension not worth

11
00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:33.270
mentioning,

12
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.170
but as filmmaking grew more sophisticated editing quickly became a crucial part

13
00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:40.320
of the creative process while still remaining largely overlooked.

14
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.650
And perhaps the most important of them all is the legendary DD Allen,

15
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.650
Bonnie and Clyde is one of the most important movies of all time that involved

16
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:49.740
many influential filmmakers like Arthur, Penn, Warren Beatty,

17
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:53.820
and Francois Truffaut, but some film analysis, overlooks editors like DD Allen.

18
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.630
It is not an overstatement to say that her editing changed films forever.

19
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.200
And that's why she became the first editor in film history to be credited with

20
00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:03.690
her own title card for her work on Bonnie and Clyde.

21
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.590
So let's dive into the work of DDL and see what it shows us about the gendered

22
00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:09.240
history of Hollywood film editing,

23
00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:13.830
and who really makes the movie to really understand how Alan appended film

24
00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:14.250
language.

25
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.910
We have to look at the generation of film editors who came before her in 1938,

26
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:18.421
film editor,

27
00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:21.660
Margaret Booth wrote the cutter an essay about the role of a film editor.

28
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.380
She describes the techniques she learns that we now take for granted things like

29
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.340
establishing shots,

30
00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:30.150
using closeups to stress and emotional moment and cutting tools smoothly through

31
00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:33.270
different shots. She established an artistry to film editing.

32
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.340
It was no longer just assembling film,

33
00:01:35.341 --> 00:01:38.070
but finding the rhythm of a scene in her words,

34
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.330
cutting at its best produces a film flowing so smoothly that the audience thinks

35
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.780
only of the entertainment and gives no thought to the mechanics that went to

36
00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:46.470
create it.

37
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.160
Much of her early work in film was uncredited and she notes that apart from

38
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:52.140
editing filmmaking was a masculine affair.

39
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.830
She even implies this insight in her word choice. On the first page,

40
00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:59.400
she refers to an editor as he or she, but a director as only he,

41
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.510
she collaborated with DW Griffith and other influential early directors whose

42
00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:06.600
films created the playbook by which all other editors worked,

43
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.430
the more invisible the editor, the better.

44
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.840
<v 1>Long shot to shot single single.</v>

45
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.350
There was almost a formulaic way of presenting film.

46
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.980
<v 0>That style remains the exclusive method of film editing in Hollywood until DDL</v>

47
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:21.290
Allen appended at all.

48
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.360
<v 2>No, nobody else over your shoulder and say, you're here.</v>

49
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.713
Why do you need that?

50
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.040
<v 0>From the start of her career, Alan, couldn't help, but break rules.</v>

51
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.260
She got her start editing television commercials,

52
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.920
a medium that naturally disobeyed Hollywood standards commercials needed to

53
00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:45.710
communicate a lot of information in a short period of time.

54
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.630
So they favored striking fast paced,

55
00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:49.940
cutting over the slower paced Hollywood style.

56
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.710
And she didn't shy away from these techniques.

57
00:02:51.711 --> 00:02:53.810
When she transitions to editing feature films,

58
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.980
Alan's in your face and rhythmic style sent shock waves throughout the industry.

59
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.690
She made a name for herself by turning Hollywood editing tropes on their head

60
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.260
rather than a biding by the industry standard of using a dissolve to signal the

61
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:08.590
passage of time. Alan preferred to do the exact opposite. Instead,

62
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:11.770
she would cut harshly from one moment to another. At the start of her career,

63
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:14.530
she defaulted to Hollywood norms, but in the 1960s,

64
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:17.650
she experimented with using a harsh cut to imply the passage of time.

65
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.950
Instead of a dissolve by the seventies, her cuts grew more daring.

66
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.410
And in this scene, she jumps to later moments in the night.

67
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.230
<v 3>Hey man, I didn't really at the top.</v>

68
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.110
<v 0>And by the eighties, her cuts jumps to new days entirely.</v>

69
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.670
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

70
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.300
<v 0>This technique puts the editor in the forefront and calls attention to the cuts.</v>

71
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.680
But instead of disrupting the film,

72
00:03:37.681 --> 00:03:41.190
it lends a rhythm to these scenes and it gives more information to the viewer in

73
00:03:41.191 --> 00:03:42.390
a shorter period of time.

74
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.570
Soon after her films received a claim editors throughout the industry,

75
00:03:45.571 --> 00:03:47.760
mimicked Allen's signature, fast paced editing,

76
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.650
and her techniques became commonplace.

77
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.280
Another example of an editing technique that she made standard was pre lapping

78
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.740
audio from the next scene into the scene proceeding it.

79
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.300
<v 3>You can't haul it down my rainbow.</v>

80
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.410
<v 0>These are techniques so widely used now, but almost seems mundane.</v>

81
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.250
But at the time it was another example of her rule-breaking style at the start

82
00:04:08.251 --> 00:04:11.130
of Serpico, she uses it to great effect. We hear the siren,

83
00:04:11.131 --> 00:04:13.740
the rhythmic beating of the windshield and the labored breathing.

84
00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:15.750
Before we even see a character on screen,

85
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.870
she communicated the tense tone of the film immediately, and it works.

86
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.630
This opening challenge has several established editing convention.

87
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.760
<v 2>So you said you always start with a long shot.</v>

88
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.420
Then you move in to an over shoulder or a group shot. And he said,

89
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.300
and you never changed that order. And somehow or other,

90
00:04:33.301 --> 00:04:35.130
I was breaking that rule constantly.

91
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.000
<v 0>Instead of opening on a wide shot of the city or even a medium shot of the car</v>

92
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.510
out chose to open the film on a close-up of ALPA Chino's bleeding face.

93
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.410
She replaced a spatial establishing shot with a tonal establishing shot.

94
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.890
And that combined with the pre lapping sounds primacy audience for the tents and

95
00:04:49.891 --> 00:04:53.370
unsettling tone of the film it's innovations like hers that have become so

96
00:04:53.371 --> 00:04:56.760
ingrained in film language that we still see her influence everywhere Allen's

97
00:04:56.761 --> 00:04:57.900
preference to start a scene,

98
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.530
even a film on a close-up of a character reveal something very important about

99
00:05:01.531 --> 00:05:03.540
her style, her focus on performance.

100
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.870
She was an actors editor and often kept in mistakes as long as they gave

101
00:05:06.871 --> 00:05:08.100
authenticity to the scene.

102
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:11.723
<v 2>Okay.</v>

103
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.270
<v 0>Editing was no doubt in your face and never sacrifice the moments the camera</v>

104
00:05:15.271 --> 00:05:15.810
captured.

105
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.590
We can see her ability to capture the moment in the famous advocacy in dog day

106
00:05:19.591 --> 00:05:22.950
afternoon, the editing is stylistic and the cuts speed up over time,

107
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.730
but she still takes the time to hold on Pachino se paces nervously and considers

108
00:05:26.731 --> 00:05:30.270
his situation, or to cut back to his partners, nervous, look inside the bank.

109
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.780
Considering the scale of this scene with interiors, exteriors,

110
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.120
several characters and even aerial shots,

111
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.570
it would have been no surprise if it had to sacrifice these intimate moments,

112
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.200
but Alan's care to build naturally and focus on character rather than spectacle

113
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.060
makes it such an electric moment.

114
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.880
These innovations are why she became the first editor, woman,

115
00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:52.020
or man to receive an opening title card exclusively for her in Bonnie and Clyde

116
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.950
in a position at originally left the female editor, invisible her style,

117
00:05:55.951 --> 00:05:57.950
not only enhanced visual storytelling,

118
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.040
but it clearly shows the influence and editor has on the final film

119
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.680
by the 1980s, DD Alan's talent became well-established. And later in her career,

120
00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:09.860
she had a role in more than just post-production while editing for the breakfast

121
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:12.890
club writer, director, John Hughes referred to her as his film teacher,

122
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.990
she would regularly contribute during filming.

123
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.160
<v 2>She was there in person with all her equipment.</v>

124
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.470
She would walk onto the set and tell John,

125
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.670
if there was a shot or an angle she could already see when she would cut

126
00:06:24.671 --> 00:06:26.320
together. What we were doing, that she would need.

127
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.890
<v 0>You can see her influence by comparing shot coverage and the breakfast club with</v>

128
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.590
Hughes's previous film, 16 candles, for example,

129
00:06:32.591 --> 00:06:35.560
both films had a weird girl listening in on the main conversation,

130
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.290
but in 16 candles, she's only filmed in the wide shot.

131
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.580
And because of that limitation,

132
00:06:39.581 --> 00:06:42.880
her performance doesn't really land in her scene with the better shot coverage

133
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.580
and the breakfast club Didi Allen had much more to work with.

134
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.100
<v 4>Very interesting section of work that she did on that film,</v>

135
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.560
which I never thought I was going to use that way,

136
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:58.860
but she was quite enchanted and she did. So it turned out and I used a lot of.

137
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.830
<v 0>Like her previous work. The breakfast club is a feat in editing.</v>

138
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.820
Alan cuts between up to six characters at once and it never feels confusing or

139
00:07:06.821 --> 00:07:07.570
unnatural.

140
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.110
This film proves how an editor can make or break a film and makes us realize

141
00:07:11.111 --> 00:07:13.600
that he films vision comes from more than the writer director.

142
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.180
She had a say in how it was shot. And according to Hughes,

143
00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.550
she changed the way he cut pictures forever.

144
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.540
The editor he said is the single most underrated person in the whole business,

145
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.410
but collaboration is not always that smooth for some first time, male directors,

146
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.880
their ego can become a problem.

147
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.560
<v 4>The worst problem I've had with directors are young writers on their first</v>

148
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:33.843
picture. They were.

149
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.800
<v 2>Doing my first movie.</v>

150
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:40.660
The only thing I knew is I wanted a female editor because I just felt

151
00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.610
a female editor would be more nurturing to the movie. And to me,

152
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.100
they wouldn't be trying to shove their agenda. Or when they're backs.

153
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:48.820
<v 0>Bottles with me,</v>

154
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.600
Tarantino had difficulty compromising with his editor in his early films.

155
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:55.510
The date scene in pulp fiction was originally much longer,

156
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:59.440
but editor Sally Mankey fought hard to trim it down constantly going back and

157
00:07:59.441 --> 00:08:00.850
forth with him. We do that.

158
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:05.380
<v 2>For eight months. So intense. I see him more than once.</v>

159
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.780
<v 0>But like other great female editors,</v>

160
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.410
Sally had be passionate and raw talent to convince her director to change the

161
00:08:11.411 --> 00:08:12.244
film.

162
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.280
<v 4>So later, I guess I put enough pressure on him to convince them,</v>

163
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:19.570
let me try it the other way. Very often they wait.

164
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.620
<v 0>If you watch the deleted scenes at the diner and imagine Terentino's original</v>

165
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.980
even longer scene, it's pretty clear that Sally's input saved it.

166
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:31.390
After her tragic death in 2010 Tarantino called her his only truly genuine

167
00:08:31.391 --> 00:08:32.140
collaborator.

168
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.890
And one can only imagine how much stronger the pacing of his postings glorious

169
00:08:35.891 --> 00:08:39.250
bastards films would have been. If Sally was there to make them with him.

170
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:43.090
Tarantino was one of the countless male directors who owe their success in part

171
00:08:43.091 --> 00:08:44.650
to a brilliant female editor.

172
00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:50.140
The idea that a singular historically male director is the sole visionary for a

173
00:08:50.141 --> 00:08:53.890
film comes into question when considering female editors like Sally Mankey,

174
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.470
Margaret Booth and Deedee Allen,

175
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.860
these women had a lot more creative control than most people are aware of.

176
00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:03.440
<v 5>One word or two sequences. In the beginning. He said,</v>

177
00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.330
you just stay on your own.

178
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:08.720
<v 0>And throughout film history,</v>

179
00:09:08.721 --> 00:09:12.140
the editor was the only feminine point of view available to the director.

180
00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:15.710
Margaret Booth felt that directors often preferred her over a man of equal

181
00:09:15.711 --> 00:09:19.370
ability and experienced because the director could get her unique perspective as

182
00:09:19.371 --> 00:09:21.380
a woman, even 100 years ago,

183
00:09:21.381 --> 00:09:24.230
female film editors had a say in how movies got made.

184
00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.590
The very nature of an editor's work dooms the profession to be constantly under

185
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.980
appreciated. The majority of the work takes place alone in a dark room.

186
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.190
And it's unfortunate that this environment was the only one that a woman had a

187
00:09:34.191 --> 00:09:37.130
set far removed from every other aspect of filmmaking.

188
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.950
There's a cruel irony to the fact that an editor is successful.

189
00:09:39.951 --> 00:09:43.520
If her work is invisible in the final product and to filmmaking legends,

190
00:09:43.521 --> 00:09:46.430
like Alan goes so underappreciated one, can't help,

191
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.570
but wonder what other voices we miss when we say a film was made by a singular

192
00:09:50.571 --> 00:09:54.920
writer director. So the next time you watch a Scorsese film or a Tarantino film,

193
00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.540
ask yourself who else made

194
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.480
DD Alan's work and to the work of countless other women in film often remains

195
00:10:02.481 --> 00:10:04.160
invisible to the average movie goer,

196
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.440
especially when you only focus on who's producing,

197
00:10:06.441 --> 00:10:09.200
writing and directing blockbuster films. Meanwhile,

198
00:10:09.201 --> 00:10:13.070
women are dominating other less high profile parts of the film industry like

199
00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:14.300
documentary filmmaking,

200
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:18.740
four out of the five Oscar nominated films for best documentary in 2020 had

201
00:10:18.741 --> 00:10:22.760
female directors or co-directors documentary films featured legendary editors,

202
00:10:22.761 --> 00:10:26.390
writers and producers that like DD Allen are often overlooked.

203
00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.700
But with curiosity, stream's newly expanded library.

204
00:10:28.701 --> 00:10:31.790

205
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.100

206
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:38.150
a critically acclaimed documentary about the science history and cultural impact

207
00:10:38.151 --> 00:10:39.290
of food over time,

208
00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.620
which has produced and co-written and directed by Sarah Venable burns.

209
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.830
What better way to spend your quarantine days than to expand your mind?

210
00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:48.680
And there's more to CuriosityStream has partnered with Nebula,

211
