00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.540
<v 0>Today's topic is one of the most famous stories in statistics.</v>

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.300
It's also about where babies come from. I know you know where babies come from,

3
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.360
but there used to be this tale. That's what I grew up with.

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.370
That babies come from stalks.

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.180
If that child is asking awkward questions of his or her parents,

6
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.320
parents would say, well, you know,

7
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:24.120
the stalks bring the baby in draped from their bill

8
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.990
in a blanket. That's where your baby brother or your baby sister came from.

9
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.600
Have you figured out where that came from?

10
00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:34.400
Why stalks were associated with babies at all, or so there's a theory.

11
00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:38.070
It's something to do with, um, storks being a traditional symbol of,

12
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:39.950
of fertility, a religious symbol of fertility.

13
00:00:39.951 --> 00:00:43.910
And another theory is that stalks, when they go fishing,

14
00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:48.200
they're looking for embryonic life forms in the water. So that is,

15
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.150
that is two theories. Um, I don't know, I'm, I'm an economist, you know,

16
00:00:53.151 --> 00:00:57.950
I'm not, uh, not as sort of a studier of mythology and ritual. Anyway, anyway,

17
00:00:57.951 --> 00:01:00.710
to get back to the important stuff, which is the statistics.

18
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.240
So stalks deliver babies. This is the old story.

19
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.870
Let me try to prove that to you, statistically. Um, I've got my,

20
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.850
I've got my paper here, so,

21
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.630
and this is just going to be a illustrative plotting.

22
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.360
You mentioned two axes and here,

23
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.680
this is babies per year and here we have the number of

24
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.670
stalks.

25
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.090
And if you just take a bunch of European countries and I have actually seen the

26
00:01:26.091 --> 00:01:31.010
data, what you find is Turkey. If I remember, and this is Poland,

27
00:01:31.011 --> 00:01:34.220
and then you might have Germany here and then you've got a whole bunch down

28
00:01:34.221 --> 00:01:38.360
here, a couple of there, and it's not the world's best correlation,

29
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.600
but it's, it's not the world's worst correlation, uh,

30
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.030
loans down here with not many babies, not many stalks.

31
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.980
You got these big outliers here. You've got nothing here.

32
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.630
You've got no places with loads of babies and no stalks.

33
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.180
You've got no places with loads of stalks and no babies,

34
00:01:53.181 --> 00:01:55.850
and you can draw a best fit line. And it goes like that.

35
00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.260
And there was actually an academic paper about 20 years ago with the title

36
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.880
stalks deliver babies P equals 0.008.

37
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.920
And without going into the technical details,

38
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.610
you probably know that according to the conventional standards of statistical

39
00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:13.790
significance, that means this relationship is not a coincidence.

40
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.110
There is definitely a correlation between stalks and babies.

41
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.730
Now you're probably thinking to yourself, okay,

42
00:02:19.731 --> 00:02:22.160
so what's the trick because surprise, surprise talks.

43
00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:25.430
Don't actually deliver babies. Email me.

44
00:02:25.431 --> 00:02:29.450
If you actually want me to explain where babies do come from, I get a reply.

45
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.700
Well, maybe, uh, so what's going on here?

46
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.390
What's going on here is basically, as I said, I think this is Turkey.

47
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.120
This is Poland. There's there's Monaco. There's Luxembourg.

48
00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:42.350
There's Lichtenstein down here,

49
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.290
lots and lots of places with very small amounts of land.

50
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.810
There are no stalks and there are no kids basically.

51
00:02:47.811 --> 00:02:50.780
And here are places that are really big, lots of stalks, lots of babies.

52
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.580
And that's what's going on. That's enough to drive that statistical correlation.

53
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.950
So the amount of land is the hidden is the hidden factor.

54
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.330
Yet the secret thing that's driving, both a large population,

55
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.830
which means a lot of babies and is driving the large number of stalks because

56
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.490
bear in mind, I'm not, I didn't say birth rate. I'm sure there's well,

57
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.460
I expect there's no correlation for the birth rate.

58
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.870
What I'm talking about is the number of babies born each year in this,

59
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.470
in these countries, which is very closely correlated to the population.

60
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.820
<v 1>You would also perhaps expect a correlation with trees.</v>

61
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.840
<v 0>Yeah, yeah. Probably number of trees versus number of babies a year.</v>

62
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.040
Trees also deliver babies. You could, you go in all kinds of places like this,

63
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.030
and there were lots of these, um, these spurious correlations out there,

64
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.480
she does a website maintained by a guy called Tyler vigilant,

65
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.230
I think called spurious correlations full of all kinds of fun stuff like this.

66
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.640
But I said at the beginning that this is one of the most famous stories in

67
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.650
statistics. There was made famous by a fellow called DRL half.

68
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.800
And here for me is where this gets really interesting.

69
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.460
So dwell half was a journalist. And in 1954,

70
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.990
he published a book with a title, how to lie with statistics.

71
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.240
It got a rave review in the New York times.

72
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.980
It became many people say the best selling book about statistics ever

73
00:04:10.981 --> 00:04:11.814
written.

74
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.440
And I loved it when I was a teenager reading about all of these

75
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.960
tricks, all the different ways you could be deceived.

76
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.760
He's got the storks and babies in there.

77
00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:23.790
It's got loads and those are great examples. It's got dodgy maps,

78
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.350
it's got dodgy graphs. It's got all sorts of great,

79
00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:31.950
great examples. It's very funny book. I'm not the only person who liked it.

80
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.510
And Goldacre who wrote bad science and many other great books about numbers.

81
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.930
He praised through our half Charles Wheelan who wrote a book called naked

82
00:04:39.931 --> 00:04:43.440
statistics. He said it was an homage to Darryl half.

83
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.080
There were loads of fans of drought, half out there.

84
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.990
<v 1>This book is in praise of statistics. This,</v>

85
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.350
this book is supposed to be doing a service to statistics program.

86
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.820
<v 0>So that I think is where the important question lies.</v>

87
00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.730
It is loved by nerds,

88
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.160
but it is not really in praise of statistics because what do El half is doing is

89
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.920
in chapter after chapter example, after example,

90
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.380
he's debunking dodgy statistics,

91
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.150
and he just doesn't have a lot of positive examples of statistics being

92
00:05:15.151 --> 00:05:17.220
used to aluminate the world.

93
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.780
And that's where I start to get a little bit queasy because that book was

94
00:05:21.781 --> 00:05:25.170
published in 1954. And you know what else happened in 1954,

95
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.320
two great statisticians epidemiologists, Richard doll,

96
00:05:28.321 --> 00:05:33.000
and Austin Bradford Hill provided some of the first solid evidence that smoking

97
00:05:33.001 --> 00:05:37.800
cigarettes might well give you lung cancer because it's the same year,

98
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.940
two different visions of what you can do with statistics there L half is saying,

99
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.250
it's a bit of a joke. It's a bit of fun.

100
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.000
I'll tell you the story about the stalks and the babies, but don't,

101
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.830
don't ever take statistics too seriously,

102
00:05:49.831 --> 00:05:51.960
because they're just a way for people to lie to you.

103
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.090
Austin Bradford Hill and Richard doll are using this vital

104
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.690
to find out the answer to one of the key medical questions of the

105
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:05.060
20th century. And when you think about it,

106
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.780
they couldn't have done that in any other way than using a statistical lens.

107
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.160
So even to notice that lung cancer cases were on the increase and they were

108
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:17.900
massively, you need to be systematically counting cases of lung cancer.

109
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.470
I mean, you maybe there'd be some anecdotes, but you need the numbers.

110
00:06:21.471 --> 00:06:22.304
You need the data.

111
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.680
And then to show compellingly that there's evidence

112
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.250
of causation. You really need to work hard with the statistics.

113
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:34.220
There's a lot of people at the time thought it was something to do with cars,

114
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.360
which is not crazy.

115
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.040
We think about it between the beginning of the 20th century and the 1950s lung

116
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.980
cancer is on the increase. So our cars, loads of cars,

117
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.830
maybe it's something in the tarmac. Maybe it's something, you know,

118
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:48.140
coming out of the exhaust is not a crazy idea,

119
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.050
but it turns out it wasn't the cars. It was the.

120
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.040
<v 2>Cigarettes. This is, this is so important.</v>

121
00:06:54.041 --> 00:06:57.850
This is such a key fact understanding that this thing is true.

122
00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:59.230
This is saved.

123
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.950
<v 0>Literally tens of millions of lives, possibly hundreds of millions of lives.</v>

124
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.770
And you've got to L half in, remember this,

125
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.660
the best selling book ever published about statistics saying

126
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.980
don't ever take statistics too seriously because they're basically

127
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.160
liars. We'll use them to lie to you.

128
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.370
There's a twist in this story because in the 1960s,

129
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.780
the U S Senate held hearings to decide whether a

130
00:07:25.781 --> 00:07:30.430
cigarette packets should have warning labels on them, should smokers be warned.

131
00:07:30.431 --> 00:07:31.720
You know, maybe this is going to kill you.

132
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.530
And they got all these expert witnesses in to discuss the evidence.

133
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.610
And one expert witness came in and he told the senators, look,

134
00:07:39.611 --> 00:07:44.470
don't worry too much because there are a lot of funny correlations out there.

135
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.530
Let me tell you about stalks and babies.

136
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:52.480
And he sat there and he told the senators all about how you could demonstrate

137
00:07:52.481 --> 00:07:55.630
this correlation between babies and stalks.

138
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.450
He used a slightly different example, but the same basic argument.

139
00:07:58.690 --> 00:07:59.560
And it's the same with,

140
00:07:59.561 --> 00:08:03.040
with cigarettes and lung cancer and the Senator who was chairing the commission

141
00:08:03.041 --> 00:08:03.850
said,

142
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:08.440
do you seriously mean to tell me that there is as,

143
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:13.390
as casual a relationship between smoking and lung cancer as the risk between

144
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.250
stalks and babies and the, the expert witness says, yeah,

145
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.580
they seem to me to be about the same and his name.

146
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.250
You may have seen it coming derail,

147
00:08:24.251 --> 00:08:28.960
half the guy who published how to lie with statistics,

148
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.150
he was actually working on a sequel course,

149
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.930
which was never published called how to lie with smoking statistics.

150
00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:38.890
So he'd taken this, you know, this, you know, funny,

151
00:08:38.891 --> 00:08:43.840
witty skepticism about statistics and this great little book,

152
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.210
and he'd soured it into this nasty cynicism that everything out

153
00:08:49.211 --> 00:08:50.230
there is fake news.

154
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:54.490
You can't believe a single thing you're told and had then gone to work for the

155
00:08:54.491 --> 00:08:58.830
tobacco who found him to be the perfect witness for their case.

156
00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:04.220
<v 3>If you'd like more great stories like this from Tim Halford, check out his book,</v>

157
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:06.140
how to make the world add up.

158
00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.010
This is what it looks like just in case you need to know the links in the
