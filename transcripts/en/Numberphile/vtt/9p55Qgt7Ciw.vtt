00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.750
<v 0>Today is about Europe's long lost medieval number system.</v>

2
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.970
So for the first thousand years of the first millennium,

3
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.700
there was one game in town and that was Roman numerals.

4
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.380
Everyone knows what revenue was, are one, two, three, four,

5
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.270
five, et cetera. Then from the 13th century, thereabouts,

6
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.590
there was a new guy in town and that was Arabic numerals, which as we know,

7
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.000
zero one, two, three, four, five,

8
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.390
and for the next hundred years, there was a couple of centuries. Actually,

9
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.940
there's a kind of battle between who's going to win,

10
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.540
which is going to be the dominant number system. And as we know,

11
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.050
the one that won the notation that we use all over the world is the Arabic

12
00:00:45.051 --> 00:00:47.900
number system. It's like much, much better. It's kind of place value.

13
00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:49.250
It's got the zero, et cetera.

14
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.990
What almost no one knows is that in the late middle ages.

15
00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:58.430
So between the 13th and the 15th century, there was a third guy in town.

16
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.280
This was the notation that was devised and developed and used by

17
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.990
the Cistercian order.

18
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.430
So this is a group of monks is actually the most influential religious order of

19
00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:12.770
the late middle ages, but actually an offshoot, you know,

20
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.450
a little bit of ecclesiastical history.

21
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.360
They're an offshoot of the Benedictines who didn't think the Benedictines were

22
00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:18.200
aesthetic enough.

23
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.250
It has a kind of minimalist lifestyle where it's just you and like the earth.

24
00:01:22.251 --> 00:01:26.210
So what the Cistercians did is that they were really in sort of manual labor.

25
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.261
And as a result of that,

26
00:01:27.261 --> 00:01:31.670
they actually developed lots of techniques and agriculture and architecture.

27
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.060
And they built up from a beginning in the mid 11th century, two,

28
00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:36.080
three centuries later,

29
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.240
they had about more than 500 monasteries all across Europe from

30
00:01:41.241 --> 00:01:42.620
the North of the British Isles,

31
00:01:42.621 --> 00:01:47.210
down to the Mediterranean from Poland on one side to

32
00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:48.230
Portugal and the other.

33
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.240
And they used amongst themselves a secret number notation.

34
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.710
And I want to show to you, it is like magical looking. It's kind of mysterious.

35
00:01:57.711 --> 00:02:02.600
Also here it is. So I'm going to write down four numbers in Cistercian

36
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.393
notation.

37
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.890
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

38
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.110
<v 0>These are four numbers. What can you make out of that? And in fact,</v>

39
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.350
this is a puzzle. I call it it's a monkey puzzle.

40
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.260
I love that one. I haven't read it as much. It's a monkey puzzle, um,

41
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.020
in my new puzzle book about languages,

42
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.250
and this is a kind of scientific language notation book there.

43
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.540
That one they're very good,

44
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.750
especially for Christmas gifts and during lockdown for spending all your

45
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.630
evenings, doing all these wonderful language and number puzzles,

46
00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.380
but you didn't make this up. This is like, this is totally true.

47
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.230
It's totally true. Um, there in fact,

48
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.520
no one really knows about it until about 20 years ago,

49
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.390
a historian of science called David A.

50
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.860
King wrote a book about it because he had realized and discovered he did his

51
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:19.630
sort of the kind of life's research on this number system.

52
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.400
And the book is accepted as true.

53
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.050
And you can see these in some of the ancient texts and this kind of secret

54
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:28.360
number system. Obviously it didn't catch on,

55
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.440
but it was used by various different groups for kind of medieval ciphers and

56
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:33.610
secret number systems.

57
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.480
So it was used even once the Cistercians stopped using it. Anyway,

58
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:38.860
I'll tell you something more about this assertion.

59
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.820
This assertions were brilliant.

60
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.930
So it was the ones are very aesthetic type of life. And so they banned speaking.

61
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.980
Okay. So about a thousand years ago, they a vow of silence.

62
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:51.790
You weren't allowed to speak. So they developed their own sign language.

63
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.060
So when the first people develop their own sign language and they used the sign

64
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:59.230
language for a thousand years and I called up the British Cistercian Abbey,

65
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.090
there's only one left in England and says,

66
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:04.660
do you still use this five silence sign language? And they said,

67
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.330
no, we don't. But some of my elder monks still understand it.

68
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.530
And it's so great because what they do is that they get these words and they

69
00:04:16.531 --> 00:04:21.060
have to piece the meaning of the words into smaller

70
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.190
bits. So for example,

71
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.960
and also each bit is a kind of mime of what the word represents.

72
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.950
So what'd you think this might mean Adobe read whole

73
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.200
milk. This is milk cause milking the other, okay.

74
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.030
This is Brown. So chocolate milk.

75
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.770
Okay. In other one, this, that Brown, I don't know why that is Brown,

76
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.850
but there's a great book was written in the seventies where, um, uh,

77
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.900
a researcher went into one of these abbeys where they were still speaking and

78
00:04:54.901 --> 00:04:57.150
took loads of pictures. I don't know dad. In fact,

79
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.420
there's a great puzzle about this in anyway.

80
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.880
So I know all about the Cistercians. They're absolutely fascinating.

81
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.810
Another one just very quickly. This means land or country.

82
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.400
What country is this?

83
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

84
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.680
<v 0>Drink tea land England. Yes. Brilliant.</v>

85
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.790
Okay. Another one that you're liking this so much. What does this.

86
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:29.723
<v 1>Bingo.</v>

87
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.070
<v 0>Ring? Not cool.</v>

88
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.990
E O E tall E

89
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.700
land. It's Ellie.

90
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.950
Uh, okay. Let's get back to here.

91
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.780
So is it true?

92
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.530
It does look a bit like hangman or it looks a little bit like stick, man.

93
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.030
You could put a little sort of head there.

94
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.000
I'm going to give you more of a cleaner. I'm going to say what the numbers are.

95
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.810
This is actually 1,410.

96
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.670
This one is 4,173.

97
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.290
This one is five seven, five zero. And this one is a one, three,

98
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.860
six, eight. Now, do you have any more of a clue about how this works?

99
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.790
<v 2>Uh, I mean obviously where things come off, the main STEM is important.</v>

100
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:20.680
<v 0>Yeah. Very good. Very good.</v>

101
00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.280
You might want to freeze it now and people can have a think because I'm about to

102
00:06:24.281 --> 00:06:25.240
give the game away.

103
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.170
<v 2>Okay. A little bit of elevator music</v>

104
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.880
here.

105
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.110
<v 0>This is one, four, one zero.</v>

106
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.190
I'm going to tell you already that it's expressed as a decimal.

107
00:06:42.191 --> 00:06:43.930
So the system is decimal.

108
00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.700
We've got two ones here and these two bits look quite the same and we've got two

109
00:06:48.701 --> 00:06:51.250
fives here and these two bits look the same.

110
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.820
So actually that's something like that is going to be like a five.

111
00:06:54.821 --> 00:06:55.571
That's going to be a one.

112
00:06:55.571 --> 00:06:59.230
And also that's like a one we've got one going out there. So,

113
00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:00.910
but you're beginning to piece together.

114
00:07:00.911 --> 00:07:05.080
This idea that these elements that are coming off rather than the sides,

115
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.650
the ends are the digits expressed in some way,

116
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:13.420
it is a system that can only write every number from zero to

117
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.050
9,999. It can't do any other numbers.

118
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.910
So this in fact is how you count. Zero is just the STEM.

119
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.960
So every number has a STEM. That is one, this is two. This is three.

120
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:30.070
This is four. Now we get funds. That's a four. So I can say zero one, two,

121
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:34.510
three, four, there's four, five as foreign ones who put the 41 together.

122
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.520
That's five. This is six to get to seven, which is six. And one is that eight,

123
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:43.600
which is six and two and nine, which is six and three. Is that,

124
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.400
that is zero to nine.

125
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:49.120
But what you see is that if you divide it into four quarters,

126
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:54.220
the units go here. This is tens. This is hundreds, and this is thousands.

127
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.030
So that is a 1000, that's a 400.

128
00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.740
Then we get this one here and zero.

129
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:04.150
So briefly choose any four digit number and let's write the number. Uh,

130
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.140
you'll say you were born six, six, six, six, six. Well, that's going be easy.

131
00:08:08.141 --> 00:08:12.880
So go to six, six, six, six. It's going to be six, six,

132
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.860
six, six. It looks quite good. It looks like a, um,

133
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.630
a quad bike signal from above.

134
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:27.280
How about 20, 20, 20, 20 would be two. So it's that?

135
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.370
And zero and then two. And then there's that,

136
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.350
but how about say 1969 is zeros born best years. Okay.

137
00:08:35.351 --> 00:08:36.071
So 19.

138
00:08:36.071 --> 00:08:40.570
So it would be a one here and it will be a nine and then there'll be a

139
00:08:40.571 --> 00:08:45.310
six and then a nine. Nice. It's quite fun. Isn't it?

140
00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.820
<v 2>Wouldn't be very useful for things like mathematics. Like if I said add</v>

141
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.520
3,472 to whatever, like.

142
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:57.570
<v 0>No, but what be really cool and really easy.</v>

143
00:08:57.571 --> 00:09:01.500
And where it was used by the Cistercians is for dates because dates have four

144
00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:06.090
digits. So it's like brilliant w for my puzzle book where I put this in,

145
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.800
I wanted the publisher to actually put the date in the opening page written and

146
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.110
substation notation. But I was told that quite latte,

147
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.990
but another thing where it is good and it is often used,

148
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.960
it was used by the Cistercians was for page numbers of books.

149
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:26.100
Roman numerals are still used widely in modern culture,

150
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:30.870
but they're only used at times when you use numbers, not for mathematics.

151
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:35.190
So dates, page numbers, chapter numbers,

152
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:40.020
Superbowls, things like that. So you could quite easily do the Superbowl and,

153
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.780
um, Cistercian numbers. Maybe you could do some, I know.

154
00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:47.550
Is there any kind of the Catholic Olympic games or something they could use that.

155
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.890
<v 1>It's a cool system. Isn't that really cool?</v>

156
00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.610
<v 0>This is highest or room and</v>

157
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:07.160
is toilet because it's the shame house.

158
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.730
A barn is cow eyes.

159
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:17.930
<v 1>Shame, shame house. Yeah. Excuse me. Can I ask where to show them houses.</v>
