00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.000
<v 0>So Brady my good friend,</v>

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.840
Eric angiolini who lives in Brussels.

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.040
He came up with the following operation. This is an operation.

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.110
You can take a number and you can transform it. If you start off with 123,

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.840
if you look at the first two digits, it says 12,

6
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.590
you're allowed to have that divided by two,

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.860
and you would get 63 that's illegal operation,

8
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.190
take a sub number and divide it by two. If it's even,

9
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.750
or you could double the number,

10
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.460
you could also take the two and you could double it and you'd get 143,

11
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.660
or you could double the three and you get 126,

12
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.230
or you could double the 23 and you would get 146,

13
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.590
or you could double the world and you will get 223.

14
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.290
So those are examples of things you can do.

15
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.850
Let's take something like two Oh two, one eight.

16
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.080
There's a nice big number.

17
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.390
You can focus your attention on any sub number in there.

18
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.140
So for instance, if we look at that too, that's an even number.

19
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.240
We can divide it by two, and that would give us one Oh two, one eight,

20
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.640
and we have a choice. And that, in fact, I call this Schweider breasts.

21
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.380
It's Brussels choice because in honor of Aerie,

22
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.640
you could also take the two Oh two and divide it by two.

23
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:25.470
And you would get one Oh one, one eight, and you can do any sub string.

24
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.400
If it's even,

25
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.410
you can either divide it by two or double it in place. If it's odd,

26
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.580
you can just double it.

27
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:33.710
<v 1>And you can choose that.</v>

28
00:01:33.711 --> 00:01:36.290
And it's completely arbitrary where you attack like that.

29
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.180
<v 0>Yes, you're free to choose,</v>

30
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.660
but you have a target because you're trying to get back down to one.

31
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.230
<v 1>Uh, that's the game.</v>

32
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.810
<v 0>That's the game. Get to it, or conversely,</v>

33
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.420
because this is a symmetric operation.

34
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.070
If you can go from X to Y you can equally well go from MITRE X.

35
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.980
Every these operations are reversible.

36
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.350
<v 1>And what are we iterating here? Are we we're going in steps.</v>

37
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.400
<v 0>But I want to show you one more example here, because this is the surprise.</v>

38
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.880
This is the joke from two Oh two, one eight.

39
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.780
If I pick that eight and double it,

40
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.140
we get two Oh two, one, one six.

41
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.410
That eight has become 16 in place.

42
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.480
I've keeping the two Oh two one,

43
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.440
but I'm doubling the eight and we get two Oh two, one, one six,

44
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.800
or I could take that 18 and divide it by two.

45
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.730
And we would get two Oh two nine.

46
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.290
And we've shortened the length by one digit.

47
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.880
It's not difficult to prove that if you start with a number and once you get by

48
00:02:40.881 --> 00:02:44.960
this operation is at most 10 N and at least,

49
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.040
and over 10th,

50
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.870
you can find examples where it gets you arbitrarily close to end of a 10.

51
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.070
So there's a wide range of numbers. Okay. So let's let that rules with one step,

52
00:02:55.071 --> 00:02:58.490
obviously that's with one step. Yes. And then the question is,

53
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.060
if you start off with a random number,

54
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.550
how long will it take to get to one? Is it even possible to always get to one?

55
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.570
<v 1>Is it, Oh yeah. I want to know. Yes. Well, show me an example of getting to one.</v>

56
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.890
<v 0>Okay. Yes. Well,</v>

57
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.660
so let me go the other way round and let's go from one and see what we can get

58
00:03:18.661 --> 00:03:21.480
because it's symmetric, but one, we can go to two. In fact,

59
00:03:21.481 --> 00:03:26.430
we can only go to two from two. We can go to four from four. We can go to eight.

60
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.590
From eight. We can go to 16. From 16. We can go to 112.

61
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.420
This is the crucial step.

62
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.740
We double that six and we get 112 from 112.

63
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.150
We can divide by two and go to 56. From 56.

64
00:03:42.151 --> 00:03:46.920
We can divide by two and go to 28. From 28.

65
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.990
We can divide that eight by two and go to 24. Then bingo, 12,

66
00:03:51.991 --> 00:03:56.130
six, three, three is hard to get to from one,

67
00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.210
but you can do it. And it took one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

68
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.260
nine, 10, 11 steps to go from one to three.

69
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.240
And if you want to have some fun, figure out how to go from one to seven,

70
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.850
say or nine or 73.

71
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.500
<v 1>Oh, you completely changed the game on me.</v>

72
00:04:13.501 --> 00:04:16.320
Then I thought this whole game was going to be about taking arbitrary numbers

73
00:04:16.321 --> 00:04:20.040
and getting down to one. It is, but I'm reversing it now.

74
00:04:20.041 --> 00:04:22.260
You've just built a new game where you go up, you go.

75
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.560
<v 0>You start it. But these steps are reversible. Well, all right,</v>

76
00:04:25.561 --> 00:04:29.010
we start at three. How do we get to one? We double it. We get six.

77
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.840
Double it again. 12, double it again. We get 24 double the four 28.

78
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.850
Double it again. 5,600. And are now at 112.

79
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.540
We can divide that 12 by two and get six.

80
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.870
So it's goes to 16 and an eight four, two, one.

81
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.010
<v 1>Can I give you any number? Can we always get to one? Yes.</v>

82
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.350
<v 0>So that's a very good question. And the answer is no.</v>

83
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.730
Look at all the numbers in the world, all the positive images in the world,

84
00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.540
there are two kinds, those that end in zero or five,

85
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.790
and they're all connected.

86
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.780
And those that don't end in zero or five and they're all connected.

87
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.700
So I can get from one to 73 and I can get from one to 74,

88
00:05:11.701 --> 00:05:16.650
but I can't get from one to 10 or one to 90 or 95 because they end in a

89
00:05:16.651 --> 00:05:17.130
five.

90
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.110
If the last digit was a zero or a five that doesn't change under

91
00:05:22.111 --> 00:05:23.430
these operations.

92
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.930
<v 1>So that we'll never get to one because it will always end with a zero or a five.</v>

93
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.070
Yes. Okay.

94
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.580
<v 0>And let me prove that you can always get to one,</v>

95
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.040
if it doesn't end in a zero or a five, or I suppose that's not true.

96
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.020
Look at the smallest number that cannot get to one. Let's call it.

97
00:05:43.021 --> 00:05:46.020
K K never gets to one,

98
00:05:46.021 --> 00:05:50.460
no matter how clever we'd how hard we try and K doesn't end in zero off.

99
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.970
That's the claim. Suppose you could get from K to a smaller number,

100
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.520
then that would be a counterexample. Because if you get K to say,

101
00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:03.350
L and L is less than K L would be a smaller number that you could not get to

102
00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:05.750
one from because this, the operation reversible.

103
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.440
So every number that you can get from K must be bigger than K.

104
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.900
So that means look at the digits of K.

105
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.470
We can't have a six because we did we'd have it.

106
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.340
And we get a smaller number for UK. Yeah.

107
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:23.240
We didn't have that numb have the six digit and we get to three and that would

108
00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:27.530
be smaller than K. So every digit of came must be odd. Okay.

109
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.890
And what's more, it can't be three.

110
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.440
There can't be a three digit in K,

111
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.090
because we could do this to it and get it down to one.

112
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.400
And that would be a smaller number.

113
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.270
This chain takes you from three to one.

114
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.260
This chain takes you from two to one. I didn't show you how to go from seven.

115
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.270
Okay. When we got to 28,

116
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.400
I could go to 14 by having the whole number and having it again to seven.

117
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.000
So seven via seven, 14, 28, 56,

118
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.110
seven goes to one. And what about nine? If I could do nine,

119
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.390
I will have done all the digits. Single digits, except five and zero and five.

120
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.530
And Sarah, you can't do, we can't handle them.

121
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.300
So how do I get to the nine? 18 would be good.

122
00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:18.380
So from 14, I can double the floor and get 18.

123
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:23.900
I can have the 18 and get nine. So nine is connected to one.

124
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.800
So all the numbers between one and nine,

125
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.900
a joined to one except five and zero.

126
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:34.560
<v 2>So K can't have a one, a two, a three or four. It could be.</v>

127
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.470
<v 0>It could have a one,</v>

128
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:40.030
it could be all ones or it could have a five in the middle of it.

129
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.270
K could be maybe one, one, five, one.

130
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.220
That's so far. I haven't ruled that out because you can't get from five to one.

131
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:51.790
So all the digits of K are ones and fives. Okay.

132
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.960
So if there was a five in the interior of it, well,

133
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.570
it would have to be followed by a one from 51.

134
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:03.430
We can go to 52 double the one we can go to 26 and 26 is less than 51.

135
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.920
So we've got reached a smaller number.

136
00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.560
<v 2>So they could be followed by another five. Yes.</v>

137
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.240
<v 0>It did. But the last five must be followed by a one. So if this argument works,</v>

138
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:18.100
just look at the right most five, and we get a smaller number. What about,

139
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.360
um, a number that's all once. K.

140
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:27.490
So the argument so far has shown that K must be all at once. Well,

141
00:08:27.491 --> 00:08:31.240
all right. Look at the last two ones, double it,

142
00:08:31.241 --> 00:08:34.690
make it a 12 of it, make it a six. So we've changed 11 to a six.

143
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:39.130
We've got a smaller number contradiction. So K does not exist.

144
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:44.170
So every number not ending in a zero or five can get to one.

145
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.680
And conversely, because these operations are symmetric,

146
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.790
we can go from one to any number, not ending in zero and five.

147
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:56.760
Now what about the other numbers? The numbers at the end do end in zero or five.

148
00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:57.830
Well,

149
00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:02.810
they they're all connected and that maybe I switched to red and show you that

150
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:07.640
we can get from 90 to 10 because whatever this number is,

151
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:11.240
we can get from one, one seven, nine, three, zero.

152
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.990
We can get to 10 proof.

153
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.750
This number doesn't end in zero or five. Well,

154
00:09:20.751 --> 00:09:24.230
we can get to one from it. So we get to 10 and then two, five.

155
00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.040
So the other class of numbers are all connected.

156
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:33.020
We use the first argument to get everything down to 10, but,

157
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:38.510
and never the Twain shall meet. There were two, two connected components. Okay.

158
00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:41.420
So the question is, if you start with a big number,

159
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.380
how many steps is it going to take to get down to one assume, make it end.

160
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.140
It doesn't end in zero or five. There are two parts to that.

161
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:52.850
One is to look at what's the biggest number you can get from one in case steps.

162
00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:57.560
And the answer is basically you can use the greedy algorithm in one step.

163
00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:01.490
All we can do is go to two and two steps. All you can do is get two, four,

164
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:06.590
and then eight, and then 16 from 16, the biggest one,

165
00:10:06.591 --> 00:10:10.640
two, three, four. The biggest thing you can get as a, 112 by doubling the six.

166
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.270
The rule is if you want to get the biggest number, you look for a digit,

167
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.320
which is bigger than five, and as far to the right as possible.

168
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:20.570
And you double that. If it's a six,

169
00:10:20.571 --> 00:10:24.920
you go from that six all the way to the end and you double that string.

170
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.970
And that's the biggest child. The biggest number you can get in,

171
00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.580
in that step from 16, it's pretty clear.

172
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:36.410
The best you can do is double the six in place. And we get one, one, two,

173
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.270
one 12, which we read, which is 112 will be, can do as double the whole number.

174
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:46.160
So we get two to four from two to four. All we can do is double it.

175
00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:50.960
And we get four, four, eight. And when we double the eight, we get four, four,

176
00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:55.820
one six, and now we've got a six. So we get four, four,

177
00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.870
one, one, two. This is doing the greedy algorithm.

178
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:04.190
It's possible that we could get a bigger number by not being greedy,

179
00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.030
but being more devious and taking us more Securitas route.

180
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.250
And after a certain number of steps,

181
00:11:10.251 --> 00:11:12.590
getting a bigger number than we would get from this.

182
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.930
So now that there is no digit bigger than five,

183
00:11:14.931 --> 00:11:19.430
so we just double it and we get eight, eight, two to four.

184
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:24.170
Finally, here we have digit. So the bigger than five.

185
00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.740
And we look for the right, most, one of them, and that's the eight,

186
00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.180
which is furthest to the right.

187
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:33.410
And we double the number starting at that eight all the way to the end.

188
00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:38.390
So what we get is the eight one six four four eight. Now, again,

189
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:43.130
we have numbers that are six or higher, and we look for the right most one,

190
00:11:43.131 --> 00:11:47.720
which is the final eight means we just double that eight in place.

191
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.920
And we get eight one six, four four one six,

192
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.320
the eight becomes a 16. We've lengthened the number by one digit,

193
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.910
and we've done it in the optimal way.

194
00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:01.780
If we had doubled the number from the six onwards,

195
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:06.250
we'd get a smaller number because that six would become a 12 and the number

196
00:12:06.251 --> 00:12:10.990
would begin eight one one by keeping the six and just

197
00:12:10.991 --> 00:12:15.070
doubling the final eight. We used to keep the start eight one six.

198
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.000
So this is bigger than doing anything else. Let's keep going again.

199
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:22.510
We look for the right most digit, which is bigger than, or equal to six.

200
00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:26.350
And that's six at the end. Again, we look for the right,

201
00:12:26.351 --> 00:12:28.360
most digit that's six or higher.

202
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:33.370
And we double from there all the way to the end.

203
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:37.180
Again, look for the, the right most digit, which is six or more,

204
00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.900
and that's this aid. So we double near to the end.

205
00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:46.030
So that's going to give us, I want to keep eight one one two eight,

206
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:50.470
and now we double this and we get one six, four, four, eight, and in a minute,

207
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.780
we'll see a pattern. Let's go one more step.

208
00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.480
We just double the eight and we get eight

209
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:02.230
+1 281644166 at the end, let's double that

210
00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:06.880
(811) 281-6441.

211
00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:11.830
The six becomes a 12. And now we can see the pattern.

212
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:16.480
That number is the same as this number. And then one, two, three,

213
00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:17.560
four steps.

214
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:22.660
What has happened is we took that number and we put a prefix in front of it.

215
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:25.960
Eight one one two. Oh yeah. So from this point on,

216
00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.510
there's a simple rule for the biggest number.

217
00:13:28.511 --> 00:13:31.300
You can get using N steps starting at one,

218
00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.260
and it grows by every four steps.

219
00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:39.640
It grows by putting eight one, one two in front of it,

220
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:44.200
which is like multiplying it by adding four digits at the end.

221
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:46.420
If the number is bigger than this,

222
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.850
and we know we can't get to it by going in, by taking one, two, three, four,

223
00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:55.180
five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. If the number is,

224
00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:58.660
is bigger than this, we need more than 12 steps to get to it.

225
00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:03.610
So this gives us a lower bound on how many steps we need to get to end.

226
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.420
We know that we can get down from skipping five.

227
00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:09.670
<v 3>We can.</v>

228
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:13.810
<v 0>Get from any digit one through nine,</v>

229
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.290
we can get down to one and it must 11 steps.

230
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:22.450
You may remember that it took me 11 steps to get from one to three or from three

231
00:14:22.451 --> 00:14:25.300
to one. So this is 11 steps.

232
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:26.753
<v 3>In fact.</v>

233
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.260
<v 0>Any number between one and 99, not ending in zero or five,</v>

234
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.290
gets down to one in at most 12 steps.

235
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.890
So if we start off with some huge number and we want to get to one,

236
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:46.080
we look at the first two digits and we apply at most 12 steps

237
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:49.710
and change the, whatever it is. We change it to a one.

238
00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:54.830
I should also say that we can get from any number that ends in zero or

239
00:14:54.831 --> 00:14:58.850
five. We can get down to five and at most 12 steps,

240
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:00.650
the same thing in short,

241
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.930
any two digit number we can reduce to adding one Oh

242
00:15:05.931 --> 00:15:10.040
five and it was 12 steps. So say we have some huge number.

243
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.620
We want to get to one. We just whittle away.

244
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:16.880
We look at the top two digits and map them to either one or five.

245
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:21.530
And we repeat that. And each time we do that, it's taking,

246
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:25.700
it's costing us at most 12 steps. So roughly speaking,

247
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:26.750
12 times,

248
00:15:26.751 --> 00:15:30.620
the number of digits in the number is an upper bound on how far we have,

249
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:35.770
how many steps we need to take to get down to one. Now, when I was younger,

250
00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.550
I was taught not to play with matches like these,

251
00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:44.290
but I think we can make an exception for today's episode sponsor. Brilliant,

252
00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:49.570
and have a look at this. Can you see the fifth square in this arrangement?

253
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:54.580
Can you make four squares here by removing five matches?

254
00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:58.240
These are just examples of the sorts of puzzles you're going to find on.

255
00:15:58.241 --> 00:16:01.390
Brilliant. And there were loads of great courses, too.

256
00:16:01.391 --> 00:16:02.950
Like the ones you're seeing on screen.

257
00:16:02.951 --> 00:16:06.520
Now these are pretty elaborate courses with lots of steps to go through.

258
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.470
They're fun, interactive,

259
00:16:08.471 --> 00:16:13.450
