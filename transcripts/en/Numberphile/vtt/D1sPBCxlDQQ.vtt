1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.980
<v 0>We and many other creatures share a mechanism for</v>

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.080
what you might call extracting numerosity or the number of things from the

3
00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:10.914
environment.

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.210
It's really very important for all sorts of creatures and for all sorts of

5
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:16.044
reasons.

6
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.760
<v 1>Extracting numerosity from the environment. What does that mean?</v>

7
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.650
<v 0>What I mean by this is that our fish needs to know how many other Fisher in a</v>

8
00:00:24.651 --> 00:00:27.020
shell. So it enjoined the larger show.

9
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.750
So the numerosity efficient shells is important.

10
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.740
Lions need to know how many invading lions into their territory.

11
00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:36.320
There are usually this is done through sound.

12
00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:39.980
They can hear them coming so they can decide whether to flee or to fight.

13
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.970
So this is just extracting the number of things from the environment,

14
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.330
because they have to decide what's relevant in the environment.

15
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.670
So the lions are at paying attention to the number of roars that they can hear.

16
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.240
And the number of distinct roars, the fish are paying attention,

17
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.930
not to the seaweed, but just to other fishes are spending around.

18
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.780
So they have to focus on a particular set of objects.

19
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.760
So this is a mechanism that fish and lions, and we share these.

20
00:01:07.761 --> 00:01:10.490
We think we share them. We certainly have similar mechanisms,

21
00:01:10.491 --> 00:01:14.540
whether all these mechanisms come from a common ancestor or not. I don't know.

22
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.800
And this requires genetic research at the moment. That's not available.

23
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.730
<v 1>Professor,</v>

24
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.380
do animals need to know the number or do they just need to know a greater than

25
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.030
or equal sort of thing? Do they know, okay,

26
00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:27.650
there's more on the left than the right.

27
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.600
They don't need to extract an actual number, right?

28
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.210
<v 0>Sometimes that's enough having a, you know,</v>

29
00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:35.390
a rough sense of how many there are may be sufficient because if you've got a

30
00:01:35.391 --> 00:01:39.440
lot of fish swimming around in a shell that say a hundred fish over here versus

31
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.290
50 fish over there, you're not going to be able to enumerate them,

32
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.980
but you've got to have a way of extracting at least approximate numerosity from

33
00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:49.130
that, the way in which that stand is probably something like this.

34
00:01:49.131 --> 00:01:52.640
You kind of extract the approximate density of the fish.

35
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.680
Then you see how big an area these fish cover say you could,

36
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.360
it's basically density times area than fish. Fish can do that.

37
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.280
Sometimes you need to do it. Exactly.

38
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.240
So if there are three lions defending against four lions,

39
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.730
they need to know that there's just one more of them.

40
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.050
Then they have a decision to make we're four on there three. Then we attack,

41
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.350
we defend our territory. So sometimes you need to know exactly.

42
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.510
Sometimes approximate we'll do.

43
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.070
One proposal came up in the early eighties is that we all possess an

44
00:02:25.071 --> 00:02:29.960
accumulator. And so the more things that you experience the fuller,

45
00:02:29.961 --> 00:02:34.250
the accumulator gets, let me give you a helpful analogy. Supposedly,

46
00:02:34.251 --> 00:02:37.160
I've got a jug that say with marks on it.

47
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.570
And for each thing I see I have a cup of water and I pour it into the junk.

48
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.460
So for each thing, however big,

49
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.090
the thing is it's the same cup of water or whatever the thing is,

50
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.330
it's the same cup of water. So if I see three things,

51
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.320
then the joke will be filled to there by see four things there'll be to there,

52
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.760
five things they're up to about 10 things. This is a very simple mechanism.

53
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.020
There's evidence. Now, at least in frogs,

54
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.390
that there's a particular neuron that does this in monkeys.

55
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.760
There's evidence that there's a mechan,

56
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.500
a single neurons that seem to behave like one of these accumulators.

57
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:18.250
That is the more things that the monkey sees, the more,

58
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:22.450
this particular neuron fires. So there's, I know this is number five.

59
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:27.340
So I can say this a monotonic relationship between the number and the firing

60
00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:30.880
rate in the case of other animals, it may not be firing rate.

61
00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:33.610
It might be done in some other way. And we don't know, uh,

62
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.780
it may be done within a neuron or it may be done in terms of connections between

63
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:40.750
neurons. Now give you an example from frogs. Now,

64
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.990
most people think frogs are pretty stupid, but here, um,

65
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.490
they perhaps tell us human something that we ought to have known all along.

66
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.020
So imagine these particular species of frogs that have been started,

67
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.270
they're in a swamp and they want to mate and the male wants to mate with a

68
00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:02.020
female. So it has to attract a female, the female can't see it.

69
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.700
And he can't see the female. So it's meeting is done by, uh, by sound.

70
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.290
So what the male frog has to do is at least not the meeting itself,

71
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.370
not the net, that's true, not the meeting itself, but the choice of a mate, uh,

72
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.620
depends on sound. What the male has to do.

73
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.340
It has to make it appear that it is the most,

74
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.920
the fittest male in the swamp.

75
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.850
And it does this by making a series of noises called chucks.

76
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.870
I'm I'm up. Well, okay. I've got really good at

77
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.820
The female will be attracted by the number of chucks in a

78
00:04:41.821 --> 00:04:45.780
phrase. Cause the more chunks you can make more fit,

79
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.660
more substantial. You are now numbers important.

80
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.440
It's better than volume because volume will depend upon how far away you are

81
00:04:52.441 --> 00:04:55.920
from the male. But number doesn't depend on how far away you are from the male.

82
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.890
And it turns out that frogs compete with each other.

83
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.680
So if I make five chops,

84
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.350
my neighboring man.

85
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.870
<v 2>Might make five. Plus a woman.</v>

86
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.170
<v 0>This might escalate until you reach the limit of how much breath you can</v>

87
00:05:13.171 --> 00:05:18.030
have to make a number of chunks in the phrase. Second auction that it is,

88
00:05:18.031 --> 00:05:21.030
it's a bit like an auction. Now why this,

89
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.650
I don't know if it applies to humans that if you make a lot of noise or war

90
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.290
noises, you're more likely to attract a mate. But anyway,

91
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.170
that's the way it works in fog. Now what's interesting is,

92
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.270
but Gary Rose at the university of Utah,

93
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.110
he showed that there's a neuron in the brain of the frog.

94
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.990
That seems to act like an accumulator. Uh, so it,

95
00:05:41.991 --> 00:05:45.350
it heres the number of chunks made by, uh,

96
00:05:45.351 --> 00:05:49.050
another frog and it thinks aloe he's made five.

97
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.880
I have to make an extra one.

98
00:05:50.881 --> 00:05:55.590
So then it will generate an extra Chuck to make it six

99
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.040
chucks. So it's not counting the number.

100
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.650
<v 1>That the other guy made. It has to count how many it makes.</v>

101
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.260
<v 0>Try. It has. Yeah. I've only been making false. I better, I better up my game.</v>

102
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.420
So it looks as though there's, there is, uh,

103
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.290
something rather like an accumulates in the brain of the frog.

104
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.710
Now we don't know much about it for other the brains of other creatures.

105
00:06:14.711 --> 00:06:18.460
And we don't know whether there's an equivalent mechanism in our brain,

106
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.520
but there's no reason why there shouldn't be. So for example,

107
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.560
when we think about timing, there's a gene, which you can find in the fruit fly,

108
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.760
which were already very, very distantly related to called Tim,

109
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.450
which is a timing gene, which responds to a particular interval.

110
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.380
Now it turns out this Tim gene is conserved in us.

111
00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.260
Now we use it in a rather different way from the, the fruit fly.

112
00:06:41.261 --> 00:06:44.830
And it combines with other genes and other mechanisms to make our timing

113
00:06:44.831 --> 00:06:49.780
mechanism more general, uh, and more detailed than the fruit fly. But,

114
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.170
you know, if there's, uh, a gene in the fruit fly for time,

115
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.890
there could be a gene in the frog, or even in insects.

116
00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.230
It can also count for counting,

117
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.640
which we share with them and which builds an equivalent type of mechanism.

118
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.770
<v 1>You used the analogy of like a measuring cylinder or a vessel being filled in</v>

119
00:07:08.771 --> 00:07:10.090
an actual brain.

120
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.170
What is being filled like where is where's this stuff being stored,

121
00:07:14.171 --> 00:07:16.450
what's being filled up to accumulate into.

122
00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.810
I can imagine the pulses from the neurons, but how are they stored?

123
00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.650
<v 0>Yes, that's, that's a very, very good question.</v>

124
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:28.810
And it's one that is extremely controversial. You've hit on a very raw,

125
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.900
what should I say, nerve, um, here.

126
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:36.250
So one argument which has been made by Randy Gulistan at Rutgers

127
00:07:36.251 --> 00:07:38.770
university, and he was also, uh,

128
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.380
thought he was one of the co-organizers of this meeting.

129
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.460
He argues that things like time and number are actually stored in

130
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.980
polynucleotides in, in the neuron itself.

131
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.340
And this is going to have an effect on the way in which the neuron connects with

132
00:07:51.341 --> 00:07:52.070
other neurons.

133
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:56.630
Another idea is that it's got to do with the connections between neurons.

134
00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.250
There've been some modeling exercises, usually neural networks,

135
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:05.200
where either the network learns to recognize a particular numerosity like

136
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:08.290
five newness, because if it's five NUS,

137
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.130
it goes into a particular state and the virtual neurons connect up in a

138
00:08:12.131 --> 00:08:15.520
particular way. And if it's not five, then they connect up in a different way.

139
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.600
Or it can just be some kind of internal mechanism, which for example,

140
00:08:19.601 --> 00:08:20.740
to harness proposed,

141
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:25.720
whereby a network of neurons can organize itself into

142
00:08:25.721 --> 00:08:30.640
say Tunis or threeness or fullness or five five-plus roughly speaking.

143
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.720
<v 1>So does that mean as each accumulation happens, then your network says, okay,</v>

144
00:08:34.721 --> 00:08:36.250
let's move into foreigners position,

145
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:38.920
or there's been another one that's moving to five and a specific, Oh,

146
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:41.290
now we're going to go into six in this position. Yeah.

147
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.590
<v 0>That's, that's what the neural network people would say.</v>

148
00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.860
And it's not entirely clear how that's going to work.

149
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.100
That's one of the current controversies,

150
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.320
but in a simple accumulator mechanism,

151
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.900
it will be a single that responds to a

152
00:08:57.901 --> 00:09:01.890
particular numerosity of whatever it happens to be tuned to. If it's,

153
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.990
let's say tuned to the number of sounds,

154
00:09:03.991 --> 00:09:06.870
it hears that's what it will respond to.

155
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:11.130
So it'll respond more to fineness than to foreigners. And in fact,

156
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.870
there is some evidence that in monkey cortex and indeed in

157
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.950
kind of homologous part of bird brain,

158
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:24.450
there are individual neurons that responds preferentially

159
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.550
to particular numerosity. So if the monkey sees an array of five,

160
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.630
this neuron will respond more to five than to foreigners or to sixes.

161
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.520
And similarly in the bird brain,

162
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:39.960
there is evidence for single neurons acting as an accumulator. In fact,

163
00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:40.830
in the monkey brain,

164
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.940
the number of neurons seem to be in a cleft in the parietal lobe.

165
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.380
So the parietal lobes run there and there's a kind of a fold at the bottom of

166
00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:53.370
the fold. Technically the funders, there are these number neurons.

167
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.700
If the number of neurons are down there on the lateral surface, here,

168
00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:01.230
there are going to be accumulator neurons, sometimes called summation neurons,

169
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:05.880
which fire more when they experience more things.

170
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:11.100
And it's believed that it's not been yet demonstrated that there's a connection

171
00:10:11.101 --> 00:10:15.480
between these neurons, these accumulated neurons and the number of neurons.

172
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.930
So if this accumulator neuron gets to five minus,

173
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.960
then it will activate down here the neuron,

174
00:10:21.961 --> 00:10:24.540
which preferentially responds to five NUS.

175
00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.930
So that's the way people think it works at the moment.

176
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:32.270
<v 1>If we've seen this accumulator, perhaps working in the frog,</v>

177
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.230
which is very exciting,

178
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.310
why haven't we been able to see it in humans that we probably study even more

179
00:10:37.311 --> 00:10:40.910
than frogs? Why has it not shown itself yet? Well.

180
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.670
<v 0>That's an interesting question then.</v>

181
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.410
And that's because we can use very fine

182
00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:53.930
electrodes to probe the brains of frogs. And at the moment,

183
00:10:53.931 --> 00:10:58.370
we're not allowed to do that with humans, unless, for example,

184
00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:03.290
it's in the course of surgery. So for example,

185
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.030
in intractable epilepsy,

186
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:08.570
the surgeon would like to remove the epileptic focus,

187
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.590
but the surgeon would like to do that without damaging the parts of the brain

188
00:11:12.591 --> 00:11:14.810
that the patient really needs.

189
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:19.820
So you have to find out which bits of the brain are really important to the

190
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:20.480
patient.

191
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.770
And what you do is you open up the skull and you put a grid of electrodes on the

192
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:28.460
exposed brain. And then you see with various tests,

193
00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.310
which parts of the brain rather selectively.

194
00:11:31.311 --> 00:11:33.950
Now just a few thousand neurons respond,

195
00:11:33.951 --> 00:11:38.600
let's say to speech or to particular words or this case to particular

196
00:11:38.601 --> 00:11:39.434
numbers.

197
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:44.390
And so what for example is a Parviz in Stanford has done is he's

198
00:11:44.391 --> 00:11:49.040
found neurons or perhaps neuron clusters that respond to particular

199
00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:52.970
digits. So in part of the brain down there, um, which,

200
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.780
where you do some of your visual processing,

201
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.920
there seem to be little clusters of neurons that respond to the digit five.

202
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.240
They're not to five minus, okay. Not to the numerosity vibe and other,

203
00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:06.490
some other work done by Carlos.

204
00:12:06.491 --> 00:12:09.010
And Menza in iZone at the university of part of her.

205
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.730
And what he does is something slightly different with epileptic patients.

206
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:17.500
What he does is he stimulates the brain in such a way that it

207
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.250
temporarily disables, the bit that's being stimulated.

208
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:24.310
So he's been looking at calculation.

209
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:29.260
So there are particular bits of the brain, which if you stimulate them stops,

210
00:12:29.261 --> 00:12:31.420
you doing addition, but not multiplication.

211
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.540
And another bit that stops you doing multiplication, but not addition.

212
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:35.830
So it looks as though,

213
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:39.310
although addition and multiplication is spread over several different sites,

214
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:40.780
each particular site,

215
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.610
just a few thousand neurons is doing a particular arithmetical

216
00:12:45.611 --> 00:12:46.444
operation.

217
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.350
<v 1>These people have to be conscious for, for them to know, yeah.</v>

218
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.790
<v 0>They have to be conscious that's right. So we open up the, well,</v>

219
00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.110
not me personally,

220
00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.560
but the brain is opened up and the person has to be conscious or,

221
00:12:58.561 --> 00:13:02.370
or else that the surgeon doesn't know what the different bits of the brain are

222
00:13:02.371 --> 00:13:03.080
doing.

223
00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.730
<v 1>With the people that really want to know this,</v>

224
00:13:05.731 --> 00:13:08.520
the inner workings of how our brains dealing with numbers.

225
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.220
<v 0>One of the problems is that, uh,</v>

226
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.850
not everybody is very good at learning arithmetic and that many different

227
00:13:14.851 --> 00:13:18.090
branches of mathematics. And, uh,

228
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.120
some people are not very good at arithmetic, but a very good at geometry.

229
00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.330
We've tested some of those. Some people are not really good at geometry,

230
00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:27.060
and we're very good at arithmetic and we've tested some of those.

231
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.340
So I'm talking really here about arithmetic,

232
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.030
cause this is the closest we get to what animals can do.

233
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:34.680
So there are some people who,

234
00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:39.240
despite every opportunity don't seem to be able to develop arithmetic

235
00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.610
in the normal way. Now,

236
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:46.050
if they've inherited a mechanism for rep

237
00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.780
extracting numerosity from the environment, sorry,

238
00:13:48.781 --> 00:13:52.470
if I have to use that expression again and then representing it in their,

239
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.550
in their mind, if that's not working very well, uh,

240
00:13:56.551 --> 00:14:00.390
then this is a problem because this seems to be the foundation for learning,

241
00:14:00.391 --> 00:14:04.800
arithmetic, understanding what the numerosity of a set is,

242
00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:09.300
is critical to learning arithmetic. A set has a definite number of members.

243
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:14.100
If you add another member, it changes the numerosity. If you take a member away,

244
00:14:14.101 --> 00:14:17.790
it changes the numerosity. It's very exact, very specific.

245
00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:20.730
And it's the difference between a set of five and a set of six,

246
00:14:20.731 --> 00:14:22.590
which has just got one more member.

247
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.710
So if you're not very good at representing sets,

248
00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.820
and then numerosity is both of which, by the way, abstract things, I mean,

249
00:14:29.821 --> 00:14:30.960
the set is abstract.

250
00:14:30.961 --> 00:14:34.200
And the numerosity of the set property in the set also have track.

251
00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:35.790
That's a whole other issue.

252
00:14:35.791 --> 00:14:40.350
That's played philosophers for at least two and a half millennia.

253
00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:45.030
The point here is that these people are not very good at the

254
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.990
foundations, not very efficient at the foundations for arithmetic.

255
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:52.310
So they don't, for example, know that five nurses,

256
00:14:52.311 --> 00:14:55.520
just one more than foreigners, they can count. Okay.

257
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:59.900
But that internal representations not very good. We, we might speculate have,

258
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.620
uh, they're accumulated doesn't work very efficiently.

259
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.050
So if it doesn't work very efficiently, they're not very,

260
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.040
they don't have a very reliable representation. Let's say of five minus.

261
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:11.180
Uh,

262
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:15.530
and that means that the relationship between their representation of five nurses

263
00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:19.310
and the digit five or the word five is not very good.

264
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.660
And this means that they are really bad at learning arithmetic.

265
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:28.880
They need extra help rather than the way that a dyslexic who has a problem

266
00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:34.070
relating lesser strings to words has a problem that needs special

267
00:15:34.071 --> 00:15:34.460
help.

268
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:39.350
What we've been trying to do is trying to create digital environments in

269
00:15:39.351 --> 00:15:43.520
which kids can play around with sets combined sets together,

270
00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.100
which is like addition or separate sets,

271
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:50.960
just like subtraction and relate sets two digits. And two words.

272
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:53.540
We feel this might help overcome this problem,

273
00:15:53.541 --> 00:15:55.760
which is usually called dyscalculia.

274
00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:58.490
Dyscalculia is actually quite a big problem. I mean,

275
00:15:58.491 --> 00:16:01.730
it probably affects something like 5% of the population.

276
00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:06.650
And it's been calculated that this costs us at least two and a half billion

277
00:16:06.651 --> 00:16:09.920
pounds a year in the UK. So worldwide,

278
00:16:09.921 --> 00:16:14.720
if it's 5% of the worldwide population, it's a serious and expensive business,

279
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:19.940
uh, because people who've got dyscalculia have all sorts of consequential life

280
00:16:19.941 --> 00:16:22.970
problems. Like they're not very good with money. They're not very good at,

281
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:27.320
at work. So it's known to be a serious problem in everyday life.

282
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:31.520
One of the first dyscalculia books we ever saw was in prison for shoplifting.

283
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:33.260
And the reason he shoplifted it was,

284
00:16:33.261 --> 00:16:37.310
he was too embarrassed to go to the counter with his purchases because he didn't

285
00:16:37.311 --> 00:16:38.750
know how much money to give.

286
00:16:38.751 --> 00:16:41.000
And he didn't know if he was getting the right chain. And of course,

287
00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:45.020
kids in school, you know, the 5% of kids in school who have this problem,

288
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:50.390
get this every well, five days a week because they have, uh, um,

289
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:51.890
maths lessons five days a week.

290
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.030
So one of the things we're trying to do is to help these kids overcome that

291
00:16:56.031 --> 00:16:58.790
problem for which you need specialized help. Now,

292
00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.520
one of the things I'm trying to persuade teachers,

293
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:04.310
educational professionals like educational psychologists,

294
00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:08.930
and ultimately the government is that the problem with these discount Kuliks is

295
00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:12.950
that this mechanism that we've seen operating in a whole range of different

296
00:17:12.951 --> 00:17:14.870
creatures might be the same in humans.

297
00:17:14.871 --> 00:17:19.190
That Johnny is not really as good as Billy or on these kinds of tasks.

298
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:23.840
We're trying to show that this is an innate problem. Rather like colorblindness,

299
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:28.070
a small mutation has affected the way in which this accumulated mechanism in the

300
00:17:28.071 --> 00:17:31.850
brain has been built. And this is, this has got long long-term consequences.

301
00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:37.160
Unfortunately, the government doesn't recognize it at the moment and, um,

302
00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:42.380
other, uh, bodies that should be taking it seriously. Um,

303
00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:47.480
and not recognizing it either. However, uh,

304
00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.440
Singapore,

305
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:53.460
which is a country that always comes top or close to the top on all

306
00:17:53.461 --> 00:17:57.900
international mathematical comparisons, they take it seriously. They say,

307
00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:03.120
we've got 10% of kids who need learning support in mathematics.

308
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:05.730
We don't know why they're having this problem,

309
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:07.620
but we'd like to try and help them.

310
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:11.010
At least maybe half of those will be dyscalculia X.

311
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.360
So where we're collaborating with the Singapore government and the national

312
00:18:15.361 --> 00:18:19.680
Institute of education there to try and develop some digital environments in the

313
00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:22.830
first place to help these kids ever come their problems.

314
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.780
<v 1>Dyslexia doesn't have this problem of recognition that help does it. No,</v>

315
00:18:26.781 --> 00:18:28.130
it doesn't. One of the reasons.

316
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:29.690
<v 0>It's thought that if you can't,</v>

317
00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:32.570
if you'll find any reading difficult or spelling difficult,

318
00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.930
this is a real handicap and it is a real handicap.

319
00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:41.510
Also a lot of celebrities have come out as dyslexic,

320
00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.980
uh, showing that it's possible to be successful, even though you're dyslexic.

321
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:50.810
However, it's also the case that if you having, if you've got poor literacy,

322
00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.300
you also got worse life chances,

323
00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:57.560
but it also turns out, well, if you've got poor numeracy,

324
00:18:57.561 --> 00:19:01.880
you've got even worse life chances than having poor literacy,

325
00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:05.720
but why isn't that coming out? Because people think, Oh, well, it's,

326
00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.650
it's okay to say I'm terrible at math. Um,

327
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:12.530
but it's not okay to say I'm terrible at language,

328
00:19:12.531 --> 00:19:15.500
or I'm terrible at reading or I'm terrible at spelling. Well,

329
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:20.480
sometimes you say that. Um, so I think attitudes are a bit different. Also.

330
00:19:20.481 --> 00:19:25.130
The other thing is that vastly more money has been thrown at the

331
00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:29.420
dyslexia problem than, uh, has been thrown at the dyscalculia,

332
00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:33.980
probably vastly more money, uh, both here in America and Europe. But of course,

333
00:19:33.981 --> 00:19:37.730
this is part of what I call the virtuous or the vicious triangle,

334
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.880
because there's no recognition, there's no money because there's no money.

335
00:19:40.881 --> 00:19:42.950
There's no research because there's no research,

336
00:19:42.951 --> 00:19:45.140
there's no recognition and so on.

337
00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:49.760
Whereas if we could just intervene in one of those nodes in the triangle,

338
00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:51.530
maybe we could make a big difference.

339
00:19:51.531 --> 00:19:56.000
If you've got better research or more research or more spectacular research,

340
00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.920
we get more recognition.

341
00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:02.870
You get parents who are complaining to their local MP

342
00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:07.910
that their children are not getting the right type of help because they're just

343
00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:12.380
Qlick then government might change their mind. But even though there's a,

344
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:16.460
the British dyslexia association and there was dyslexia action.

345
00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:21.590
And then of course, there's all autistic society as ADHD societies.

346
00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.490
There isn't a dyscalculia association,

347
00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.670
the British dyscalculia association.

348
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:33.440
So parents at least bear some of the responsibility here,

349
00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:38.150
but of course they don't know that the reason that that Johnny is not

350
00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.550
learning arithmetic is because he's just calculated.

351
00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:43.580
They think either thing that Johnny is lazy or Johnny is stupid,

352
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.580
but in fact he's not, he's just disco kill it.

353
00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.900
Okay. So this is a digital environment that we've created to help dyscalculia X.

354
00:20:54.901 --> 00:20:57.850
And the idea is that they understand, uh,

355
00:20:57.851 --> 00:21:02.700
about the relationship between digits and sets and they understand

356
00:21:02.701 --> 00:21:04.410
about what sets or like.
