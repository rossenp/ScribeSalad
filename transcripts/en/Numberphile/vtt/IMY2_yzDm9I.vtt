00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.890
<v 0>I would like to show you a number trick. So regular scientific calculator.</v>

2
00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:06.240
I'm not trying to conceal anything,

3
00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:08.310
but I would like you Brady to tell me what to write.

4
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.500
I'm going to put some fives into the calculator. Maybe you call the trick,

5
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.900
the surprising fives. I don't know. Maybe that's what I call it.

6
00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:14.460
And someone else could think of a better name,

7
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:17.280
but I'm going to put the digit five into this calculator as many times as you

8
00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:20.460
want me to. So tell me how many times you'd like to put the number five six,

9
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.920
two five five, five, five, five, five,

10
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.310
whatever have told me what to run with that. I'm next two steps at the same,

11
00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:28.830
whatever we do, the first step is to take the reciprocal of this number.

12
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.810
You can see why we're doing this on a calculator.

13
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.640
I know that you could do it given time,

14
00:00:32.641 --> 00:00:35.970
but the reciprocal blacks to the minus one or one over the answer, uh,

15
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.390
gives us this number handedly known as one over five, five, five, five, five,

16
00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:42.810
five, so far so good. And now we take the sign of that answer.

17
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.280
So she's going to be sign of the answer and we get this.

18
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.680
<v 1>Result, which is where I want to check what you notice.</v>

19
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.570
It's a pie. Is it what's pie? Like it's probably like,

20
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.670
Oh, times 10 to the minus eight.

21
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.350
<v 0>It's probably like enough to cause a reaction in anybody who's seen pipe before,</v>

22
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.580
I think. Okay, wait, let me try it. Once you gave me six, five,

23
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.720
I invite you to give me a different number.

24
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:09.860
<v 1>Okay. Uh.</v>

25
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.380
<v 0>One, one, five as a five. Good.</v>

26
00:01:15.381 --> 00:01:17.990
I like this and it must petition in the making here. Brady,

27
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.690
you see something surprising. You test the extreme cases, really,

28
00:01:20.691 --> 00:01:22.110
really sensible mathematical things.

29
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.730
So reciprocal one over five is otherwise known as one of the five or 0.2.

30
00:01:25.731 --> 00:01:30.650
And I take the sign of that answer and it gives me the answer 3.4906 times 10 to

31
00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:31.190
the minus.

32
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.620
<v 1>Three. Not so pilot. I kind.</v>

33
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.080
<v 0>Of talked you into giving me more than one, five a delivery said,</v>

34
00:01:36.081 --> 00:01:39.230
give me as many as you want. So invite you to try this experiment again.

35
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.300
How many fives do you like to start? 13, 13,

36
00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:47.960
five. See if I calculate all cope, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

37
00:01:47.961 --> 00:01:52.100
eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13 fives. So, uh.

38
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.700
<v 1>As a reciprocal is 1.8.</v>

39
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.870
<v 0>Times 10 of them, negative 30.</v>

40
00:01:56.871 --> 00:01:58.790
My counselor has given up trying to display it as a fraction.

41
00:01:58.791 --> 00:02:00.980
This is a tiny number. Take the sign of that.

42
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.520
<v 1>Yeah. PI like.</v>

43
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.480
<v 0>You know, your pie expansion. This is pretty pie, like,</v>

44
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.880
except for the whole thing at the end, which you did spot pretty quickly.

45
00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:12.890
That times 10 to the minus 15,

46
00:02:12.891 --> 00:02:16.250
this time that's the trick is a classic example of what I'd like to call

47
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.140
unexpected pie pie turns up literally all over the place in mathematics,

48
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.610
particularly when you don't expect it.

49
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.650
Obviously when you're doing stuff to do circles, it turns up,

50
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.950
we haven't mentioned a circle so far. PI has turned up somewhere.

51
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.120
There are several clues that I've kind of concealed from you, but.

52
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.220
<v 1>Um, in the rest of the video, I'd.</v>

53
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.920
<v 0>Like to explain why this happens, but it's worth leaving as a,</v>

54
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.080
as a surprise if you want to go.

55
00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:41.810
And if anyone watching the video wants to figure out what's going on now,

56
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.520
now's the time to do it before I give it all away.

57
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.000
The only clue I'm going to give is your calculator should be in degrees mode.

58
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.100
Otherwise you won't get as nice a result.

59
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:50.683
<v 1>That's the clue.</v>

60
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.200
<v 0>I like this trick. It's not so much a trick. It is that it's surprise.</v>

61
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.110
And I think you need three bits of maths to understand it.

62
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.270
It's a nice example of simple bits of mass coming together to give you a

63
00:03:12.271 --> 00:03:17.160
surprise chapter one, radiant. Oh, look at that. It's like an audio book.

64
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.160
Brady D do you know what a Radian is?

65
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.380
<v 2>It's like a unit for measuring angle isn't.</v>

66
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.840
<v 0>That we, and we're used to using degrees.</v>

67
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.290
So if I drew a circle and chopped it up into three quarter circle,

68
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.330
that right angle would be 90 degrees,

69
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.880
which means there's 360 degrees all the way.

70
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.930
Round 360 is this arbitrary number that we sort of inherited.

71
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.600
We didn't have to use it. In fact, we still don't have to use degrees.

72
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.660
Almost everybody learns about degrees at school.

73
00:03:42.661 --> 00:03:45.090
And it's a useful way of talking about how much you turn three 60 would they

74
00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:49.830
think is to do with our year. We're 365 days is close to three 60.

75
00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:53.580
So a sort of full cycle of a year is roundabout the three 60. So there's,

76
00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:54.960
there's a connection in history there.

77
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.810
The Babylonians used counting in base sixties,

78
00:03:57.811 --> 00:04:00.570
which has to do with 360 or 3006 hundreds.

79
00:04:00.571 --> 00:04:02.820
And all of these things are sort of historical accidents.

80
00:04:02.821 --> 00:04:06.120
And we still see this in our time measurements in hours and minutes,

81
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.130
three 60 is convenient. You can talk it up a little bit,

82
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.110
but there is a better way to measure angles.

83
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.650
Let me show you the definition of Radian. Now this circle has a certain radius.

84
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.630
And if you start deciding,

85
00:04:15.631 --> 00:04:19.290
I want to measure angles around the circle in some non arbitrary ways you could

86
00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:21.120
use 400 say, and actually they do. They,

87
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.990
the call that gradients 400 gradients all the way around.

88
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.030
If you go to your calculator,

89
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.270
there's a mode button that goes between degrees and radians and gradients.

90
00:04:30.271 --> 00:04:33.960
There's a G in there as well. It's a gradients means 400 bits around a circle.

91
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.640
It's kind of like metric degrees,

92
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.810
like cause then a right angle is a hundred and we will kind of recognized,

93
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.590
right? Angles are important. And why, why 90 then in some ways,

94
00:04:43.591 --> 00:04:45.960
gradients are very sensible. I think the French tried it for a while.

95
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.290
They liked metric rising lots of things, but it didn't really catch on.

96
00:04:49.291 --> 00:04:50.670
And not a lot of people use it a lot.

97
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.490
I'm sure people will comment if they found good examples of it being used,

98
00:04:53.491 --> 00:04:57.150
but even that's arbitrary. I mean my pick 401, I'll go for a hundred.

99
00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.500
When I go for a thousand, we could do anything. And actually our choice is free.

100
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.060
We just have to accept the consequences.

101
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.930
So what you might want to do is pick a measure that has fewer horrible

102
00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:11.640
consequences and more nice consequences and everything to do with the circle is

103
00:05:11.641 --> 00:05:14.370
tied up with this radius. And you can already see a clue in the name,

104
00:05:14.371 --> 00:05:15.870
radians that as long as I talk about,

105
00:05:15.871 --> 00:05:19.380
so this circle has a radius of one complete turn seems important,

106
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.010
but another amount of a turn would be, if you start walking around the circle,

107
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.130
some distance, why don't we pick a distance? There's already part of the circle,

108
00:05:26.131 --> 00:05:28.500
which is a radius. So if you know the radius,

109
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.310
what would happen if you walked around the circle, a radius is one radiant.

110
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.720
So the name is good. If you shorten it to rat, is, is one radius of a turn.

111
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.370
So it's making length and angle measured the same way on a unit circle.

112
00:05:41.371 --> 00:05:42.720
It means if there's radius is one,

113
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.810
then you walk a distance worn around the circle. You've gone one radiant.

114
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.110
It doesn't have a consequence which some people find nasty,

115
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.410
but just deal with it. All right, is that all the way around the circle

116
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.850
is not a nice number anymore or other is a nice number,

117
00:05:56.851 --> 00:05:59.000
but it's not a rational number because you know,

118
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:02.150
the formula for distance around the circle is two PI. If the radius is one,

119
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.350
the distance around is two PI,

120
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.610
which must mean then to do a full turn is two PI radians. Okay.

121
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.110
So that's chapter one. We're almost there.

122
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.620
The little summary is that if you accept that all the way around a circle is two

123
00:06:12.621 --> 00:06:13.251
PI radians.

124
00:06:13.251 --> 00:06:17.720
It was also known in olden days or in our previous less wise status,

125
00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:20.390
360 degrees. I can now write this relationship down.

126
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.360
Two PI radians is the same as 360 degrees,

127
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.620
which means that we could say that PI ratings is 180 degrees, I guess,

128
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:30.500
sort of this arbitrary too. And this gives us the relationship,

129
00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:32.000
the kind of the exchange rate, if you like.

130
00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:36.230
So one Radian is the same as 180 over PI degrees.

131
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.460
This relationship is important.

132
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.450
That's chapter one of our little story we've got to understand the radians are

133
00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:45.110
an alternative way to measure circles and they work like this chapter two,

134
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.590
the then small angle.

135
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.820
If I show you a picture of a graph, his set of axes,

136
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.370
and here is what it looks like a straight line graph.

137
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.980
This is a relationship between two variables. That is a linear thing.

138
00:06:56.981 --> 00:06:58.450
They call it linear because of straight lines.

139
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.690
But if I show you that same graph on a bigger scale,

140
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.110
you could realize that I could have drawn a graph like this.

141
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.570
So the thing I'm trying to point out is that a sine wave,

142
00:07:07.571 --> 00:07:11.320
which is involved in our calculation is a graph as a function has an input and

143
00:07:11.321 --> 00:07:15.520
output. But if you zoom in on this sign wave right about here,

144
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.900
can you see that? It looks a bit line. So what we're saying is that,

145
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.150
although this is not a straight line function, part of it looks like it is.

146
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.040
So if I zoom in, in fact,

147
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.270
if you work in a certain angle measurement to patrol label in a moment,

148
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.310
then this straight line function,

149
00:07:30.311 --> 00:07:34.300
which is only true at the beginning is actually the graph of wake was X.

150
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.120
Whereas the original function is Y equals signings.

151
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.170
And I hope you recognize now that the title is kind of relevant when angles Mo

152
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.720
sine X and X are basically the same thing. Here's my conclusion.

153
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.340
You can go and look up some ways to prove it.

154
00:07:48.341 --> 00:07:50.980
But visually it's pretty convincing if you zoom in on the sign graph,

155
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:55.930
sign X is approximately X, two caveats,

156
00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.370
the small angles, and only in radians,

157
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.740
which is important that we had chapter one available to us.

158
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.930
If you drew a graph of this in degrees,

159
00:08:04.931 --> 00:08:08.110
which then this straight line does not have a gradient of one,

160
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.110
which the claiming is, if you, if you think about this line being,

161
00:08:11.111 --> 00:08:14.890
going up to one here and you drop a line down here, it's about 60 degrees there.

162
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.600
So the gradient of that line in degree, yeah.

163
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.780
Is this like one over 60 tiny number?

164
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:24.070
So the question is what cool measurement do you need to make?

165
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:26.500
You have a gradient of one, which is what I'm claiming. Yeah. We,

166
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.070
you need that to be one and then it would be great.

167
00:08:30.071 --> 00:08:31.780
And one of then if you realize that that, that there's a two,

168
00:08:31.781 --> 00:08:34.510
and then that's a three, my scale, Elizabeth rubbish,

169
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:37.660
but that means this must be pie and that's to buy.

170
00:08:37.661 --> 00:08:39.160
And they were back to our readings idea.

171
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.730
So this fact sign X is approximately X cause more angles.

172
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:47.290
And if the measured ingredients end of chapter two, chapter three fractions,

173
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.860
you remember the, in the trick we did a reciprocal. In fact,

174
00:08:50.861 --> 00:08:54.820
we did one over five, five, five, five, five, five.

175
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:57.960
And actually what's important is to recognize that as a decimal,

176
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.690
that looks different. And actually when you gave me six,

177
00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:03.230
the calculators spat that fraction back is like one of the five, five, five,

178
00:09:03.231 --> 00:09:06.180
five, and five is one of the five, five, five, five, five, five,

179
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.970
which is slightly annoying of the calculator telling you the question when you

180
00:09:08.971 --> 00:09:11.010
just asked it what the answer is. So it has a decimal.

181
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.140
All we could do is do a bit of long division and work it out.

182
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.140
Or I could force the calculator to tell me it's a six fives. I do.

183
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.820
<v 1>The reciprocal of that one over that.</v>

184
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.520
<v 0>[Inaudible] otherwise known as according to my calculator,</v>

185
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:27.850
0.0000018.

186
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:29.930
Very faintly.

187
00:09:29.931 --> 00:09:33.380
You can see there's a dot above the second zero dot above the eight.

188
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:37.910
Do you know what these dots mean? I've never seen them in Europe.

189
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:38.773
They wouldn't recognize them. Yeah.

190
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.570
<v 1>In Europe, they might write this like this.</v>

191
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.810
<v 0>But that in Thai bar, but that also might make you look horrified.</v>

192
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.900
Is that more familiar to recurring? Yes. Um, for some reason,

193
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:51.290
Britain has inherited the dot notation or you Mark the place where it starts

194
00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:53.270
with caring with adult and place where it stops for, with the dot.

195
00:09:53.271 --> 00:09:56.390
And then you just carry on. Most people use in the rest of the world.

196
00:09:56.391 --> 00:09:58.130
I think use a line. They call it a [inaudible].

197
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.500
<v 1>It's the same line name as the line between a numerator and</v>

198
00:10:03.501 --> 00:10:07.730
denominator. They say, there's a fine line between a numerator and denominator.

199
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.560
<v 0>And it's called a [inaudible] anyway.</v>

200
00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.540
And this is one of the thing is it's a recurring decimal.

201
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.860
So if I didn't put the dots on here, if I wrote this character here,

202
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.770
(000) 018-0001 807. So turning fractions into decimals. Now what we could do,

203
00:10:21.771 --> 00:10:24.290
if you were so inclined, and maybe I encourage any watches, the video,

204
00:10:24.291 --> 00:10:25.150
you could go the other way around,

205
00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.860
you could check this recurrent decimal and say, if that's a recurrent decimal,

206
00:10:27.861 --> 00:10:29.240
how do you turn that back into a fraction?

207
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.000
It's actually because of school level of skill, but when it's this long,

208
00:10:32.001 --> 00:10:34.550
a recurring thing, it takes a little bit of guts to go through the process.

209
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.940
But for now there's one thing in this decimal expansion,

210
00:10:37.941 --> 00:10:39.440
which was not obvious in the fraction,

211
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.600
that gives us a clue about why this is working.

212
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:45.080
And it's the only numbers that are kind of significant in here is these two

213
00:10:45.081 --> 00:10:47.900
numbers possibly followed by the zero after it.

214
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.510
And if I just refer back to a piece of paper from chapter one,

215
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:56.120
I'm trying to point out this number has turned up and suddenly we get glimpse of

216
00:10:56.121 --> 00:10:58.040
why these things are coming together.

217
00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:02.120
The conclusion of all three chapters is when we put these facts together and

218
00:11:02.121 --> 00:11:05.810
we'll do the trick again with all three facts now, sort of under our control.

219
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.900
And hopefully it becomes obvious why the unexpected pipe.

220
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.550
<v 1>Ends up. So let's try it.</v>

221
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.540
<v 0>First of all, you did one over five, five, five, five, five, five.</v>

222
00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.570
Do you accept the answer to that calculation is.

223
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.290
<v 1>Yeah. Which means.</v>

224
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.640
<v 0>In this world of small angle,</v>

225
00:11:22.641 --> 00:11:24.770
approximately if I'm going to do a sign of something, I mean,

226
00:11:24.771 --> 00:11:28.340
this world is small-angle approximations, but I didn't say at the very start,

227
00:11:28.341 --> 00:11:30.530
but I did admit it at the end. I needed your calculator.

228
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.870
<v 1>To be in degrees, not these magic.</v>

229
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:36.470
<v 0>Radiants we've been talking about. So if I do one over five, five, five, five,</v>

230
00:11:36.471 --> 00:11:38.720
five, five, and then take the sign of it,

231
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:40.730
which is what our whole calculation was.

232
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:43.940
It is not going to be equal to one over five, five, five, five, five, five,

233
00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.130
or even approximately cause we weren't working yet.

234
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.920
<v 1>In radians. If we were working in radians,</v>

235
00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.600
then the input will be the same as the app.

236
00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:53.090
<v 0>That was my small angle business. So let's go back to our three,</v>

237
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.950
starting at the end, chapter three, the decimal version of your number.

238
00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:01.870
I'm going to write it as 1.8 times 10 to the negative

239
00:12:01.871 --> 00:12:06.070
something let's check, uh, one, two, three, four, five,

240
00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:09.130
six, so 10 to the negative six,

241
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.260
but we're working in degrees.

242
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:16.090
So if I wanted to turn it into radians so that I could start using my small

243
00:12:16.091 --> 00:12:19.450
angle approximation up here, I need to check back chapter one,

244
00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.200
my conversion turn ratings into degrees. In fact,

245
00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:24.190
if we wanted to go the other way round,

246
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.650
we better just check this just the opposite exchange rate.

247
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.880
I'm going to turn my degrees,

248
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:29.980
which is what the calculator was set up into radians.

249
00:12:29.981 --> 00:12:33.880
So I'm going to just turn the into radius by multiplying by the exchange rate,

250
00:12:33.881 --> 00:12:37.720
which is PI over one 80. So that was in degrees.

251
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.450
And this is now in radians. I've done the conversion,

252
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:43.840
which means I can now use this chapter to business to say,

253
00:12:43.841 --> 00:12:47.380
this is approximately equal because sine X and X approximately equal because

254
00:12:47.381 --> 00:12:48.730
this is small. There's no question.

255
00:12:48.731 --> 00:12:50.710
This is a small number it's approximately equal.

256
00:12:50.711 --> 00:12:54.910
Just to that number 1.8 times 10 to the negative six times PI of a one 80.

257
00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.100
And you beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel.

258
00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:58.090
There's a pie in there.

259
00:12:58.091 --> 00:13:01.690
We can see where it's coming from and there's some ones and A's possibly

260
00:13:01.691 --> 00:13:04.660
canceling. So let's turn this into 180.

261
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.790
If I make that a hundred times bigger,

262
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:12.040
I better make this a hundred times smaller to compensate times PI

263
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:15.490
over one 80. And now I think you can see that one 80 divided by one.

264
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:20.170
It cancels out and I'm left with PI times 10 to the negative eight,

265
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.230
which is the end of our trick. That's where the surprising pie comes from.

266
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.800
You do a bunch of stuff to do with the number five and I'll pop some pie to a

267
00:13:26.801 --> 00:13:28.150
very small power of 10.

268
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.890
<v 3>And the reason you were using fives is because of the relationship between.</v>

269
00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.350
<v 0>And this one eight. Yes.</v>

270
00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:38.730
Is it actually to do with the fact that there are five eighteens in 90?

271
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:42.570
So recurrent decimal is quite often to do with the number nine and ones were

272
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:45.720
recurring. It doesn't happen after every single digit ends up.

273
00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.790
<v 3>To do with being nineties and nine hundreds.</v>

274
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.630
<v 0>And so it's all to do with the fact that five times 18 is 90,</v>

275
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.160
gives us a clue. It does mean that we should be to predict what happens though.

276
00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.880
I had to do a scaling of a hundred to get the cancellation to happen 10 to the

277
00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:03.510
negative two, our hundredth to make it work. Otherwise.

278
00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:07.560
What you'll see is that it's to do with the number of fives over here,

279
00:14:07.561 --> 00:14:10.200
we had six and that six is not a coincidence.

280
00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:13.110
So we're probably in a position to make a prediction. We've done the process.

281
00:14:13.111 --> 00:14:15.060
Once with your example, we should be able to do a general one.

282
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.460
Do you want to pick a number of fives that you haven't tried yet?

283
00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:21.900
I mean 10 10 fives, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

284
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.660
There are 10 fives before we actually do the calculation.

285
00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:25.950
This is the power of mathematics.

286
00:14:25.951 --> 00:14:27.510
We should be at an app predict what's going to happen.

287
00:14:27.511 --> 00:14:30.570
We're expecting a pie to turn up, but what power of 10 direction?

288
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.240
If you turn this into a reciprocal,

289
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:37.320
I think you'll get a power of 10 to the negative 10,

290
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.130
but we're going to have to adjust it in our calculators like we did before by

291
00:14:41.131 --> 00:14:45.540
another two. So I'm hoping PI times 10 to the negative 12

292
00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:50.850
is find out, take the sign.

293
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.110
<v 1>3.14159, blah, blah, blah, times 10 to the negative 12.</v>

294
00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:00.980
Even if it's a pointless trick, at least with the power of mathematics,

295
00:15:00.981 --> 00:15:02.420
let us predict the outcome. There.

296
00:15:02.421 --> 00:15:05.270
We are surprising pie from a surprising fives.

297
00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.080
<v 4>You know, when I graduated from high school,</v>

298
00:15:08.081 --> 00:15:12.970
I felt like I was on top of trigonometry. And now I'm not really sure.

299
00:15:12.971 --> 00:15:16.300
I can tell you what a sign and a co-sign and a tan really are.

300
00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.540
If you're anything like me and you want to brush up on what all this stuff

301
00:15:19.541 --> 00:15:23.410
really means. Check out this amazing course on brilliant,

or maybe even learn for the first time about what trigonometry really is,

305
00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.530
how it works. What's it about? We'll look at that.

306
00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.060
