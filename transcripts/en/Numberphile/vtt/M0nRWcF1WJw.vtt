1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.120
<v 0>We're going to do a predator prey cycles.</v>

2
00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:06.980
We're going to do rabbits eating foxes, and we're going to try and use maths,

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:07.240
right?

4
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.450
<v 1>And what's it going to eat boxes? We're not going to do well.</v>

5
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.660
<v 0>We are doing foxes, eating rabbits.</v>

6
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.400
Can we mathematically model and explain and predict the changes in the

7
00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:23.480
population, numbers of the interaction between a predator. In this case,

8
00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:28.100
a Fox eating the prey, a rabbit, you are going to represent our price.

9
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.980
<v 0>We tend to use UNV a lot in math.</v>

11
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.630
We can't use PE because it's prey and predator.

12
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.510
So you is going to be the rabbit, the prey, here we go.

13
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.920
Attempt to draw a rabbit, some ears, a leg. Do they have whiskers? All right.

14
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.320
There's a row. I think that's a pretty good rabbit. Okay.

15
00:00:45.321 --> 00:00:47.870
And then V is going to represent our Fox,

16
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.580
got like a big tail of body paint years and they could point you note. Okay.

17
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.370
So Fox, we have a rabbit and a Fox,

18
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.360
and we want to try and write down at equations that are going to explain the

19
00:00:59.361 --> 00:01:01.520
interaction between them. You know, the rabbits will,

20
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.130
will keep growing and populating, but as they do,

21
00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:05.630
there's more food for the foxes.

22
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.120
So the foxes might start to grow and then there's too many foxes.

23
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.540
So there's like a complicated interaction between the two.

24
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.050
And that's sort of ultimately what leads to this really nice predator-prey

25
00:01:15.051 --> 00:01:16.610
dynamics in, in the model.

26
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.350
We want to try and figure out the change in the population of the prey

27
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.100
over time. So that means writing down a derivative.

28
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.660
So it's the change in the population, Stu with respect to time,

29
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.130
if we have more rabbits, we expect that, you know,

30
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.340
they're going to repopulate. This is, you know, it's, it's,

31
00:01:37.341 --> 00:01:41.000
it's a actual metaphor or idiom or whatever.

32
00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:42.620
Is there about like rabbits?

33
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.660
<v 1>So I'm going to breed like rabbits relate.</v>

34
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.760
<v 0>Robbins. That was the word I was thinking of. So the girls,</v>

35
00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:49.220
so we've got to breed like rabbits. If we have more rabbits,

36
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.160
this is going to grow. Population gets bigger. We get more rabbits. The.

37
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.750
<v 1>More rabbits you have, the more of it you get.</v>

38
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.940
<v 0>Exactly the change in the population will also be affected by the foxes.</v>

39
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.040
And that's going to be a decrease. If there's more foxes to eat the rabbits,

40
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.940
they will go down.

41
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.960
So that's going to be a minus because it depends on both Fox number and rabbit

42
00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:12.470
number. It's going to be a U times a week. So that sort of shows.

43
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.300
So this is the rabbits growing by themselves.

44
00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:18.170
And then this is being eaten by the foxes so they can put hair reproduction or

45
00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:20.960
this term. And then this is what we would call the predation term.

46
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.180
So are rabbits being eaten by foxes. Now,

47
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.000
if we want to write down on the same for the foxes,

48
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.780
so we're going to start with the rate of change of the,

49
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.550
the predator population over time. Now the Fox is,

50
00:02:34.551 --> 00:02:36.410
will grow when there's more food,

51
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.810
because they're not denying them prolific at breeding,

52
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.150
we're going to put in a constant, let's just call it alpha.

53
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.100
And this is going to be UV.

54
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.580
And this is a plus cause it's going to increase the Fox population.

55
00:02:46.581 --> 00:02:47.750
So more food available.

56
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.030
And then now what you're going to see is the negative bets that causes the

57
00:02:53.031 --> 00:02:56.330
Fox population to decrease is when there are too many foxes.

58
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.700
Because if there are loads of says,

59
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.530
there's a lot of competition for catching and eating the rabbits.

60
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.480
Whereas the rabbits don't face that problem.

61
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.830
Cause we're assuming there's always enough left.

62
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.560
<v 1>Yes, whatever rabbits.</v>

63
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.120
I used to feed my rabbit lettuce on the war. Okay. All right,

64
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.280
grass. So whatever it is, the rabbits eat.

65
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.700
<v 0>So there's going to be, we're going to show you those lots of it.</v>

66
00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:22.620
So they're just going to keep growing. But the Fox is,

67
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.950
are going to decrease when there's more foxes because there's more competition

68
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.150
to eat those rabbits. So this is going to be minus alpha times V.

69
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.720
Now the alpha is just a constant, the same app or are they, it's the same.

70
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.531
It's the same alpha.

71
00:03:34.531 --> 00:03:38.010
So I've kind of skipped over a step because what we've actually done is if you

72
00:03:38.011 --> 00:03:39.300
wrote out the full model,

73
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.200
you'd have different constants on each of the four terms. And then you do, um,

74
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.500
the classic applied maths track of non dimensionalize,

75
00:03:46.501 --> 00:03:48.840
everything to get rid of all of these constants.

76
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.830
So I've just skipped over that and all,

77
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:53.730
all that you end up with when you do that and you can work through this,

78
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.190
it's you just get the one constant, which is the same thing.

79
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.370
This is now going to be our model. So this bit here is competition.

80
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.810
So we've got the rabbits.

81
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.470
They grow because they reproduce and they go down because there's more foxes.

82
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.420
The Fox is there's more food available.

83
00:04:06.421 --> 00:04:09.420
So they increase with the rabbit population and they decrease with their own

84
00:04:09.421 --> 00:04:12.330
population because of competition. So now we have a set of equations.

85
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.440
Do you buy your tea?

86
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.640
It depends on you and V and DV here depends on you in V.

87
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.660
So this is what makes them, what we call a coupled set of equations,

88
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.500
because you can't just solve this one because you need to know V but to get

89
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.690
veer, you have to solve this one and you need to know you.

90
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.950
So this is like the sort of complex dynamics between the predator prey,

91
00:04:31.951 --> 00:04:34.290
because they are so interdependent.

92
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.430
I want another normally to solve differential equation, you do and integral.

93
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.980
You use some, you know, tricks of the trade,

94
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.010
but in the practice of pre interaction in math, biology,

95
00:04:44.011 --> 00:04:46.980
you just draw lots of really nice pictures and it's super cool.

96
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.230
So that's what we're going to do and try and draw out.

97
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.040
What does this look like in what we call the phase plan are two axes.

98
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.770
Now there are a few things we can draw straight away here.

99
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.710
So the only information we have to,

100
00:04:57.711 --> 00:05:00.840
to construct our phase plane is going to be these two equations.

101
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.440
So a good starting point is think about what happens on the two axes.

102
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.180
So if we plug in a V being zero is going to be our starting point.

103
00:05:09.181 --> 00:05:12.690
So V being zero is the UXs access here.

104
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.470
So we plugged that in that disappears.

105
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.360
So that tells us that the change in U is equal to the value of you.

106
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.130
So if I'm, let's say here at some positive number of U V via zero,

107
00:05:26.131 --> 00:05:27.180
so that term disappears.

108
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.660
And now I've got the change in the population is equal to a positive number

109
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.470
because I'm a positive number. So the change is positive means it's increasing.

110
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.430
So if I'm here, I have to be going that way. There's nothing else I can do.

111
00:05:38.431 --> 00:05:42.390
I'm just going to keep going along here, which makes complete sense.

112
00:05:42.391 --> 00:05:45.240
There are zero predators. So if you're a rabbit,

113
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.840
you're just breeding all day long and growing and growing and growing your

114
00:05:48.841 --> 00:05:53.010
population. Similarly along this one, we have that. You is that right?

115
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.100
So we have no prey. Now we'll come at this from the biology angle,

116
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.980
we've got no prey. And we have some number of predators, some number of foxes.

117
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.200
They're a bit screwed. Let's be honest. I've got nothing to eat.

118
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.430
They can't go and eat that letter.

119
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.820
So they're going to decrease and you're going to go down like that.

120
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.560
And you get the same year equations. Cause you take this plugin. You equals not,

121
00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.040
you get rid of that term and you've got the change in V equal to something

122
00:06:18.041 --> 00:06:19.810
negative. So you're going down.

123
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.920
So now we actually want to go back to our equations and think about things that

124
00:06:23.921 --> 00:06:26.320
we call a steady States.

125
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.700
So this is a particular population number where

126
00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.830
both the prey and the predator, the rabbit, and the Fox are happy.

127
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.970
It sticks at a constant number. There's no change. Once you get to this point,

128
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.330
this particular number of rabbits and corresponding number of foxes.

129
00:06:43.331 --> 00:06:47.560
Once you get there, everyone's just happy and there's no change.

130
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:48.880
We call this a steady state.

131
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.020
And so what that means mathematically in this equation is that you will be equal

132
00:06:53.021 --> 00:06:55.990
to some constant number. And so if you, as constant,

133
00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.420
it doesn't change with time because it's constant.

134
00:06:58.421 --> 00:07:00.100
That's the sort of definition of constant.

135
00:07:00.101 --> 00:07:03.760
So that term goes so to find which values of you,

136
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:08.230
our population is happy at, we just solve this equal to zero.

137
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.550
So we've got to solve you. Minus UV equals naught.

138
00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.700
We need to find values of U and V, which will satisfy this equation.

139
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.330
So the first one would be, you can be zero, then that works.

140
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.620
And then the second one you could also have. Few is not zero.

141
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.870
Then if V was equal to one,

142
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.410
you'd have you minus you now for a proper steady state.

143
00:07:29.411 --> 00:07:32.290
Remember we needed both populations to be happy. So they sort of,

144
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.460
that's why it's called a steady state.

145
00:07:33.461 --> 00:07:36.430
They reached this point and they just sit there and just Bob along,

146
00:07:36.431 --> 00:07:40.990
without changing. So if this one doesn't change, we've got the same idea here.

147
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:45.910
This is alpha times V times you minus one must be zero.

148
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.440
So if you as not, that was option one, then that's not.

149
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.950
Then the only way for that to be zero is for V to be zero because the U term has

150
00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:58.750
vanished. So if you is not the is not, and that is warm, steady state.

151
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.660
And if V is one, that's a one.

152
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.320
So you has to be one to make this Sarah now. So you as one.

153
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.110
So these are only two possible steady States.

154
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.660
These are the two values where our population is happy.

155
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.360
So now we can go back to our phase plane.

156
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.370
So we have one of them here and now this makes complete sense for no

157
00:08:18.371 --> 00:08:21.730
predators or no prey to be a happy place for the population.

158
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.870
There's nothing there. So it ain't going to change. There's nothing that can be,

159
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.730
you know, they can't reproduce, they can't kill each other.

160
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:28.683
It's just ain't happening.

161
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:32.230
It's just so nice when you do the maths and you get this answer like, Oh yeah,

162
00:08:32.231 --> 00:08:33.850
the population is happy when there's nothing.

163
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:37.420
And then you think about it as you said, Oh yeah, there's nothing there. Great.

164
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.230
That's exactly what we expect to really good sanity check where you're doing the

165
00:08:41.231 --> 00:08:42.640
right thing and your math. That's correct.

166
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:45.220
So we can either have that and they'll happily sit there.

167
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.500
But then what we can also have is one and one,

168
00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:52.390
what you can now do with this particular steady state is something called a

169
00:08:52.391 --> 00:08:56.490
stability analysis. This is a bit advanced, um,

170
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.980
sort of a dynamics or mechanics type thing. Um,

171
00:08:59.981 --> 00:09:03.510
and what we can work out is we can work out the behavior around this particular

172
00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:06.000
point. It turns out that in this situation,

173
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.730
you get something which is called a center, uh,

174
00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:11.070
near this point of the population,

175
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.740
the population pathways look like this.

176
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:18.360
So you do this stability analysis and it tells you that these things go round in

177
00:09:18.361 --> 00:09:19.170
circles.

178
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:23.070
Now we can actually complete the rest of our phase planning because the way the

179
00:09:23.071 --> 00:09:27.960
phase plane works is these arrows tell you how the population behaves

180
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:31.380
when you start to just a certain number. So we said here,

181
00:09:31.381 --> 00:09:35.310
if I start with this number of predators, the faceplate and says,

182
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.900
I'm just going to decrease in, die out,

183
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.160
which makes complete biological sense because there is zero prey here.

184
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.320
So they all just die. And similarly,

185
00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:45.420
if I start here where there are no predators,

186
00:09:45.421 --> 00:09:47.250
I'm just going to increase forever. Now we've,

187
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.210
we've done our fancy stability analysis to say that near this point,

188
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.160
they sort of go round in circles,

189
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.470
but we don't yet know which way around they go.

190
00:09:55.770 --> 00:10:00.090
And what we have to do to fill that in is look at the rest of the face plate,

191
00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.880
because there's a really important rule about phase planes that your

192
00:10:02.881 --> 00:10:05.610
trajectories, these pathways you're drawing,

193
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:10.080
they can never cross and all of the directions sort of follow.

194
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:13.620
It's like a flow. So you have water going this way and water going this way.

195
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.650
It wouldn't make sense to be sort of going like that.

196
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.030
It would be going against the flow.

197
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.820
Each pathway influences the pathway next to it.

198
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:25.920
So what's actually happening here is you've got really big cycles looking,

199
00:10:25.921 --> 00:10:30.510
something like this, going all the way around this particular point,

200
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:34.320
this one, one steady state situation. And so this is all consistent.

201
00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:36.360
Everything fits all of these directions work.

202
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.590
<v 2>Yeah, I see what you mean. It feels intuitively right up the top there,</v>

203
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.760
the rabbits are going the wrong way.

204
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.980
<v 0>Think about what's happening here. So they're going opposite to down here,</v>

205
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.600
but they've crossed through this sort of threshold, that magical pole,

206
00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.900
magical stability point up that bit where the population's happy. So,

207
00:10:53.901 --> 00:10:58.130
so what's actually happening up here is if you sort of approximately look at the

208
00:10:58.131 --> 00:11:00.710
numbers, your prayers on around one,

209
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:04.400
and your predator is like way above that. So there's,

210
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.250
there's a lot of predators per rabbit.

211
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:11.300
So that's why it kind of makes sense for the rabbits to start coming down again,

212
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.330
because you've got more proud. You've got a surplus of predators.

213
00:11:14.331 --> 00:11:15.500
So as a rabbit, you know,

214
00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:19.370
you've not just got one person after you've got like several, so we can now,

215
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.870
now we've got the space plane.

216
00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:26.240
What we do is we can pick a point on here and then follow the arrows.

217
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:31.370
And that will tell us how the population of the rabbits and the foxes will

218
00:11:31.371 --> 00:11:35.510
change in relation to one another. Now that we've got the phase plane.

219
00:11:35.511 --> 00:11:38.420
So even though we haven't solved any equations,

220
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:43.340
we've just turned our equations into a picture and the picture then gives us the

221
00:11:43.341 --> 00:11:43.790
answer.

222
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:48.470
So we now think about starting at a certain point and what will happen to the

223
00:11:48.471 --> 00:11:51.380
rabbits and the foxes. Let's see, we start here.

224
00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.320
So this is going to be population number,

225
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.500
and this is going to be time because this is ultimately what the real question

226
00:11:56.501 --> 00:11:59.290
was at the start. We want to know, how did their populations change.

227
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:01.300
<v 2>Over time? Population of rabbits or foxes.</v>

228
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.720
<v 0>Were going to be rabbits first, as you move anywhere on this diagram,</v>

229
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.170
both of them change. Cause you're in your to coordinate system. We start here,

230
00:12:08.171 --> 00:12:09.880
we're at about one, right? So it doesn't really matter.

231
00:12:09.881 --> 00:12:13.570
Let's just call that our starting point at the beginning. Now what's happening.

232
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.060
We are increasing, increasing, increasing, increasing,

233
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.090
just in thinking about what's happening to you. I pray.

234
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.810
So we increase and then we get to some maximum value of you.

235
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.230
And then we start to come back down and we go all the way down past where we

236
00:12:26.231 --> 00:12:27.940
were just looking at the rabbits.

237
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.240
And then we go below where we were hit a minimum.

238
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.080
And then we come back to this point, okay. Probably looks quite familiar.

239
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:40.330
So it's some kind of oscillation. It's like a cause or a sign or something.

240
00:12:40.331 --> 00:12:43.300
Some kind of wave like behavior in the rabbit population.

241
00:12:43.301 --> 00:12:46.330
And then we're going to just continue to go round and round this cause we can't

242
00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:47.800
cross. We can't leave. It's sort of.

243
00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:52.320
<v 2>It goes around in a circles. So we just continue to do this. So this.</v>

244
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.040
<v 1>Is the prey, the rabbits, there you go, rabbits.</v>

245
00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:01.200
<v 0>Now the Fox is so at our starting point, the Fox is, are below one.</v>

246
00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:02.160
It doesn't really matter where,

247
00:13:02.161 --> 00:13:05.320
but they're below this value C to start down here. As we move around,

248
00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.690
they slowly.

249
00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:08.850
<v 2>Increase very slowly increase.</v>

250
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.990
<v 0>Then they increase a bit faster. They slowly increase.</v>

251
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.850
Then they come around and we get to a maximum all the way up here.

252
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:21.870
And then they come back down to, it turns out approximately this minimum point.

253
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.480
So we've got a similar behavior that we saw with the rabbits,

254
00:13:24.481 --> 00:13:26.490
except when the rabbits started here,

255
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:29.730
which is sort of halfway between the maximum and the foxes are starting

256
00:13:29.731 --> 00:13:32.640
approximately at their minimum value. So they have the same.

257
00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.340
<v 2>[Inaudible] so this is the predator.</v>

258
00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:39.540
<v 0>Yes. A little teeth. I don't know if that's a Fox</v>

259
00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.160
Fox rabbit. As we go around this particular loop,

260
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:47.280
the rabbits start to increase and increase and increase.

261
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:50.820
And as the rabbits are increasing, there's quite a lot of food.

262
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.920
So the Fox says like, Oh, this is great.

263
00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.500
There's going to be more and more foxes. Cause there's lots to eat. So that's,

264
00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.850
there's plentiful food supply.

265
00:13:56.851 --> 00:13:59.600
They're going to reproduce lots and have lots of kids or whatever.

266
00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.520
Little baby foxes are called and then they're going to start to increase.

267
00:14:02.521 --> 00:14:04.740
But then as there's more foxes,

268
00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.770
the rabbits have a lot of predators after them.

269
00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.160
So now the rabbits are scared for their lives and the rabbits are getting killed

270
00:14:11.161 --> 00:14:14.910
a lot. So the rabbit start to go down, but the Fox is still increasing,

271
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.240
but now the rabbits have gone down. There's loads of foxes.

272
00:14:18.241 --> 00:14:20.790
There's not many rabbits. The foxes are going to die out.

273
00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:24.090
They've got a food shortage. Now they had a food surplus down here.

274
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.900
Now they've got a food shortage. So down here there's more rabbits and foxes.

275
00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:30.360
And then at this critical point, there's now more.

276
00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:34.140
<v 2>Then there are rabbits, even when the rabbits started falling for a while,</v>

277
00:14:34.141 --> 00:14:35.100
it was still good times. Yeah.

278
00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:38.430
<v 0>It was. It's like a lag it's lagging a little bit behind.</v>

279
00:14:38.431 --> 00:14:41.190
So they're both doing this oscillation of up and down,

280
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:46.110
but this is the Fox just legs a little bit behind the rabbit. Because until,

281
00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.840
you know, if you imagine it's one rabbit per one Fox,

282
00:14:48.841 --> 00:14:51.800
until you cross through that, it's always for the foxes.

283
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.800
There's always a surplus of food. There's more food than they need.

284
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.100
So they're just going to keep me produce it. And then, you know,

285
00:14:58.130 --> 00:14:59.210
perhaps it's due to, uh,

286
00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:02.810
the sort of gestation time or something for that for the baby to be born,

287
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:04.670
but then it sort of it lags behind a bit.

288
00:15:04.671 --> 00:15:07.280
And then all of a sudden the rabbits have gone down because there's too many

289
00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:09.110
foxes and then the foxes see them.

290
00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:12.390
<v 2>The client, and you've drawn these on this graph. There,</v>

291
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:16.060
there are similar sizes, but presumably the absolute numbers could be different.

292
00:15:16.061 --> 00:15:18.100
It could be a billion rabbits to thousands.

293
00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:19.001
<v 0>Absolutely.</v>

294
00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:23.470
So that's the reason we've done the non dimensionalization right at the very

295
00:15:23.471 --> 00:15:26.830
beginning. So they're sort of happy place is one,

296
00:15:26.831 --> 00:15:31.780
one that doesn't mean one rabbit and one Fox that sort of means the one hair

297
00:15:31.781 --> 00:15:36.190
is like the perfect number of rabbits. And this is the perfect number of foxes.

298
00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:39.430
We've sort of scaled out in that non dimensionalization.

299
00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:40.540
So I've got rid of the units.

300
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:44.050
I would imagine that would need quite a lot of rabbits to sustain a single Fox,

301
00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:47.620
the non dimensionalization. It maintains the really important stuff.

302
00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:51.760
So it tells you that you have this oscillation, this predator prey cycle,

303
00:15:51.761 --> 00:15:53.050
it tells you that it's going to happen,

304
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:54.820
but it doesn't tell you the exact numbers,

305
00:15:54.821 --> 00:15:58.690
but like from a sort of population dynamics idea,

306
00:15:58.691 --> 00:16:00.520
you don't really care too much about the exact numbers.

307
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:04.180
You just want to know that there's going to be peaks and troughs in each of the

308
00:16:04.181 --> 00:16:08.140
populations. And you can look at actual data for any pretty much any predator,

309
00:16:08.141 --> 00:16:11.950
prey situation in nature. You see exactly this, you have the,

310
00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:16.960
the boom in the prey followed by a boom in the predator and then

311
00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.020
the decrease exactly in the setup.

312
00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:22.690
And it all just follows from sort of those simple equations we wrote down at the

313
00:16:22.691 --> 00:16:25.270
very beginning and then drawing a pretty picture of the face plane,

314
00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:31.840
just to emphasize the level of favoritism with these equations,

315
00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:36.340
the full Maria Stokes equations as written down on a piece of paper,

316
00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.760
hang on which way round though, we we're talking this area.

317
00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:41.590
So those should be exactly the ones that are written down the little.

318
00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.450
Do I go the little go and the big.

319
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.560
<v 3>That's right? Yeah.</v>

320
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:48.100
And just zigzagging back and forth sort of living around zero,

321
00:16:48.101 --> 00:16:52.480
but in a really complicated way. And so the thought was that okay,
