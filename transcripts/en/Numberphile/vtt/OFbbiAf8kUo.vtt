00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.361
<v 0>Today,</v>

2
00:00:00.361 --> 00:00:05.280
I want to talk to you about the incur and that amazing system of

3
00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:06.114
numbers,

4
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.990
the largest utilization in the Americas before the arrival of the Europeans,

5
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.640
they peaked about the 16th century where the area covered by the Inca

6
00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:19.910
empire started in Columbia in the North,

7
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.240
went all the way down to sort of bits of chili via Peru, Ecuador,

8
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.290
and Bolivia all in the NDAs. So that's about several thousand miles,

9
00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:29.090
but it's about a million people.

10
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.630
So the ink is a really interesting because of the,

11
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.700
we call them bronze age civilizations.

12
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.870
They were the only one that didn't have certain important things,

13
00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:42.410
which the other problems, age civilizations did. They didn't have a wheel.

14
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.780
And you can maybe explain that because, you know,

15
00:00:44.781 --> 00:00:47.600
it's the Andes and wheels that are going to help you up a mountain.

16
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.330
They also didn't have a writing system,

17
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.670
but what they did have with this amazing system for recording

18
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.960
numbers, and they did this using knots on string,

19
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.780
the system is called Keepa or creepo sometimes it's Q U I P U

20
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.710
sometimes it's K H IPU. Um, I guess it's a,

21
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.390
it's a catch wild word catch world,

22
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.220
which incidentally is the indigenous American language still spoken by the

23
00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:18.740
largest number of people. There's about, I think about 10 million people,

24
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.070
speakers of Quechua. And that was the language of the Incan empire. Anyway,

25
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.200
I have a hippo here.

26
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.090
This [inaudible] is a replica of one that is in the American museum of natural

27
00:01:29.091 --> 00:01:33.290
history in New York. And keepers are bunches of strings.

28
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.290
They've got knots on, but there is some kind of method to them.

29
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.930
Often they work strings. Obviously this is some kind of colored lines.

30
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.000
They're not this type of string, but they all had a primary cord.

31
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.270
So that's the yellow ones. So that's the cord that doesn't have any knots on it,

32
00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:50.120
but all the other ones hang off. It's like a massive kind of janitors.

33
00:01:50.121 --> 00:01:52.250
Key-ring often there were hundreds of strings here.

34
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.200
I've only got five other strings and you've got these red ones are the strings

35
00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.130
with the knots on.

36
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.500
And the green one is a certain string that links

37
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:04.880
this set of four.

38
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.510
So you see the green one links the set to four and the green one also has some

39
00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:09.260
knots on.

40
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.180
And what I would like to do today is to explain to you how this

41
00:02:14.181 --> 00:02:15.014
works,

42
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.700
but by replicating the original decipherment of keeper.

43
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.890
So it was in the 16th century that the inkers were conquered by

44
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:29.210
the Spanish and then knowledge amongst Europeans of how keepers works was

45
00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:30.080
completely lost.

46
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.390
And it was only rediscovered in 1912 because a maths teacher could I called

47
00:02:35.391 --> 00:02:37.010
Leslie Leland, Locke,

48
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.600
fantastically alliterative named Leslie Leland, Locke,

49
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.560
um, Matthew from Brooklyn and went to his local museum,

50
00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:46.790
the American museum of natural history.

51
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.750
So this very hippo and worked out from the knots,

52
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.000
what it meant and how it worked.

53
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.850
And so why don't we go through what he would have done?

54
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.530
The first thing is let's look at each bit string.

55
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.060
So when you look at the string,

56
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.920
you see that it seems to be that there are three positions

57
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.120
and in each different position here, here, and here,

58
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.280
there are certain knots. So what I'm going to do, I'm just going to ride it out.

59
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.900
I going to say string one,

60
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.800
we're going to have position one position to position three.

61
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.140
So this is the first one. So in position one, we've got one position two,

62
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.830
we got three in position three, we've got.

63
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.133
<v 1>Cool.</v>

64
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.110
<v 0>So already we get some kind of sense of what</v>

65
00:03:49.111 --> 00:03:52.110
this might be because all the numbers are quite low,

66
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.570
actually not going above six, which is kind of interesting.

67
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.290
So that might be the first clue that something is going on here.

68
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.620
And now let's just put a line here and let's do the green string.

69
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.250
So this is the green string. This is the string that links them all together.

70
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.890
So string five, I guess one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

71
00:04:10.891 --> 00:04:14.700
actually that's eight first. Then there's a quite a big gap.

72
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.860
So that zero one, two, three, four, five, and that's five.

73
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.840
So Brady or maybe revenue, one watching this already.

74
00:04:24.841 --> 00:04:25.800
You've got this.

75
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.930
Can you begin to see what the knots might be recording and what the relation

76
00:04:30.931 --> 00:04:33.990
might be between these four strings,

77
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.170
the full red ones and the green one that links them together.

78
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.830
It's actually very simple, but if you didn't know it,

79
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.200
it's almost impossible was very,

80
00:04:43.201 --> 00:04:48.090
very difficult to try and find out that's the intellectual efforts required

81
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.940
to decipher something. Cause you're not entirely sure what you're looking for,

82
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.590
but I've made it an incredibly simple because if you actually look here,

83
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.070
let's add these ones up for six,

84
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.930
five is 15. So five carry one,

85
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.120
three, six, five, five is 19 with that.

86
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.980
One carrier is 20 there, one, four,

87
00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:15.270
five, six, seven, eight, eight.

88
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:21.030
So Leslie Lennon block realized that the answer was staring him in the face.

89
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.830
It was nothing more complicated that each string represents a single

90
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.600
number, a single three digit number. So the one that has one position,

91
00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:33.150
one, three in position two and forms it.

92
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.920
Three is actually 134 because position one is the

93
00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:41.820
hundreds position. Two is the tens and position three is the units.

94
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.390
The inkers, you know, they had this massive empire, 10, 12 million people.

95
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.340
They had bureaucracy, bureaucracy requires numbers and statistics.

96
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.740
So in a sense, the keepers which were used for, um,

97
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.390
census information for measurements, for money,

98
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.530
um,

99
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.240
such as the gel that glued his entire empire together and what you would have,

100
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.180
if you needed to record a number, you'd put this three digit number,

101
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.070
or it could be longer if you want, need more digits on each string.

102
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.710
And if you wanted to add them up to save, adding them up,

103
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.220
you would join them with another string. And that would be the sum.

104
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.830
So this is incredibly efficient. And in fact,

105
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:28.520
what they've done is they've kind of invented the decimal system without

106
00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:32.330
realizing it, what they hadn't done there, wasn't a zero knots.

107
00:06:32.331 --> 00:06:35.270
You have to realize there's a space there. So that could be quite confusing,

108
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.360
but they'd know they knew other things. So actually here,

109
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.130
I've done them all with the same note.

110
00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:41.810
That's because I'm not very good at doing knots.

111
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.350
The way that the Indians did is that the last knots where it was slightly

112
00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:46.820
different than a slightly longer knots.

113
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.760
And that's because a slightly longer night was always units.

114
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.140
So just say you had a piece of string that was came to attached or something.

115
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.340
You could look at it and you think, okay,

116
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.100
I know exactly the way this is going to go. I know to read it,

117
00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:02.030
this is goes units, tens, hundreds, and so on.

118
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.660
<v 2>It doesn't seem like it would have been the hardest thing to figure out,</v>

119
00:07:04.661 --> 00:07:06.910
like what, how could this be such a mystery for so long?

120
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.020
<v 0>Well, it was figured out in 1912.</v>

121
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.700
So the whole studying these civilizations was not very

122
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.080
developed. Also,

123
00:07:17.081 --> 00:07:20.350
people were probably interested in other things about that society.

124
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.860
And there weren't that many keepers that you could go and have a look at.

125
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:25.930
Some of the keepers had hundreds of strings.

126
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.120
If you're going to be kind of pulling them apart,

127
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.920
it's quite hard to know where to look,

128
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.390
but also why would you even think that it was arithmetic in numbers,

129
00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:38.320
even to think that it's much easier once you know that you could,

130
00:07:38.321 --> 00:07:40.240
it could have been, it could have been anything else you could have thought, Oh,

131
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:42.630
this is something that's going from one to the three to the fruit.

132
00:07:42.631 --> 00:07:45.100
It's getting bigger. There are lots of other patterns that you can see.

133
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.380
<v 2>It could have been jewelry or headwear or something. Yeah.</v>

134
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.350
<v 0>Well, I think people knew that from studying it.</v>

135
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:54.130
And obviously when they were conquered in the 16th century,

136
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.370
they didn't all die out. They kept on using it bits and bobs.

137
00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.940
And also there were Spanish historians that came over and wrote about it and

138
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.270
said, it's well known that they had a sort of counting number system,

139
00:08:04.271 --> 00:08:07.450
which was based on these, um, strings and knots. But yeah,

140
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.640
the proper decipherment was only made in 1912.

141
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.530
There are about a thousand hippies around in museums.

142
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:18.160
And a lot of still not known about them. It could be the case that some of them,

143
00:08:18.161 --> 00:08:20.650
the knots actually represent phonetic elements.

144
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:25.900
So one of the great mysteries that people who look in cardiologists looking

145
00:08:25.901 --> 00:08:27.280
at today is,

146
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:31.570
was the hippo more than just the inkers counting system,

147
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.350
but also some interesting new type of writings. Yeah.

148
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:41.410
<v 2>This episode was supported by brilliant and it's ever expanding collection of</v>

scientific thinking course.

152
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:56.430
I wonder they call it brilliant. It's interactive. It's clever, it's fun.

153
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.620
It's like going to the gym for your brain,

154
00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:02.630
but without all those sweaty changing rooms and stuff, by the way, brilliant,

Alex, this was so fascinating. Where could I read about this?

164
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:40.520
If you want to know more about that in my new book called the language lovers

165
00:09:40.521 --> 00:09:44.570
puzzle book, I have a whole section on the hippo and on a bat,

166
00:09:44.571 --> 00:09:46.010
the decipherment of it. In fact,

167
00:09:46.011 --> 00:09:50.090
the book has lots of things just going to be about language,

168
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.060
but it's also about scientific language and mathematical notation.

169
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.690
And so you're going to learn about the history of mathematical notation.

170
00:09:56.691 --> 00:10:00.110
Also in this book. I can't wait. I can't wait

171
00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.150
Christmas. That's like what a great Christmas present. Hey. Yeah.

172
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:06.200
Especially in London.
