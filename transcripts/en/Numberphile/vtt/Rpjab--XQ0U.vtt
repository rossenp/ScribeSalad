1
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.250
<v 0>We're looking for the hard,</v>

2
00:00:09.251 --> 00:00:13.100
the math for the graphic design for them, for the next ICM.

3
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.210
There were tried many ideas,

4
00:00:14.211 --> 00:00:19.040
and I was personally very inspired by the work of [inaudible] with his three

5
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.080
dimensional object, curved object,

6
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.440
not the interesting geometry with what eventually was selected.

7
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.280
There's more inspired by [inaudible] and she's very simple shapes named

8
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.580
squares, solid colors.

9
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.520
So I took me a while to warm up to this ideas,

10
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.970
but then I realized there's some cool math about squares.

11
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.640
And so I'm going to talk about one today's particular about square tonics.

12
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.770
Like for example, here you have, uh,

13
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.580
the here you can tell the whole plane was just two kinds of squares. So this is,

14
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.970
and you imagine this two squares, and if I just periodically repeated,

15
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.190
this is going to tell the whole, the whole plate,

16
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.920
this is the simplest styling you can make out of squares,

17
00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:55.910
which is not all equal.

18
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.880
And it illustrates something with the Pythagorean theorem.

19
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.740
So the way it works is that think about, so you can either say, you can,

20
00:01:03.741 --> 00:01:05.930
you can take the Steger and, um,

21
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.600
maybe he'd be anchored his at this red dot. And so then they move it. We can be,

22
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.300
you can accurate all the other red dots here in this picture,

23
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.890
but if you connect all this red dot, I'll try my best.

24
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.730
And so then this is that should have been a square. I did this.

25
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.100
You can imagine that's a square. And so what the seller says that you can be,

26
00:01:28.101 --> 00:01:30.440
you can either tell the plan with this,

27
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.960
with this two square or what this one square, repeat it.

28
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.250
And so it has to be the case that the area of these two squares equals to the

29
00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:38.390
area of this big square.

30
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.530
And that's how this is a really Pythagorean theorem because to the CLS, you can,

31
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.200
you can think that this piece is the same as,

32
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.310
so if you want to pick this to squares and move it to inside the yellow square,

33
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.480
then this piece will go here. That piece

34
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.090
will go there and maybe this piece will go over there.

35
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.130
And so this illustration of this pieces,

36
00:02:01.131 --> 00:02:04.130
you can construct either one big square or two small squares.

37
00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:06.980
And that's the a squared plus B squared equals C squared.

38
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.793
<v 1>A nice illustration.</v>

39
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.950
And this overall tiling is the simplest tiling you can do other than just

40
00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:13.784
squares of just.

41
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.390
<v 0>Though, than to the square grid. Yeah. That's the simplest.</v>

42
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.590
<v 1>One, those two different sizes.</v>

43
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.650
Is there anything interesting about their proportion to each other?

44
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.830
<v 0>The arbitrary? Yeah. So this said, because in, in, in,</v>

45
00:02:24.831 --> 00:02:28.340
in a square plus B squared equals C squared, you can choose a and B.

46
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.600
<v 1>And same with the tiling. Then it could be a giant square and a small cluster.</v>

47
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.990
<v 0>Exactly what changes individually is that the size of the smaller square</v>

48
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.250
changes. And so they all the tiling stars, stars kind of waltzing around.

49
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.710
There's something really neat math involved about how you generally think about,

50
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.830
about the square tilings. That's a, maybe I'll explain it here.

51
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.550
So this is a tiling, so it's a profuse of a tonic of a plane by squares.

52
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.220
We're going to represent it like this. There's a lot of plantation here.

53
00:02:55.221 --> 00:02:57.170
I'll explain it in steps. So,

54
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.020
so what we see here is our squares squares are numbered one through 15.

55
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.310
So this is number 10 wide. And then they're horizontal lines. And I,

56
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:08.680
and the horizontal lines, if it, if it,

57
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.990
if several square shared the same horizontal line,

58
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:12.790
I consider it as one horizontal line.

59
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.720
I drew them in red and I labeled them from the beginning of the alphabet.

60
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:17.650
So this is a,

61
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.820
and this is B this line is C and so forth up to don't age.

62
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.350
And there are vertical lines.

63
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.790
The same thing with just if some squares share the same vertical line,

64
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:31.330
I consider it as a one line. And I labeled it from the end of the alphabet.

65
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:36.040
So this line is that this is why this is X WVU.

66
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.670
And so now we want to represent this picture as a graph and what will be in the

67
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:40.420
graph here.

68
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.380
Now you can make a choice and the fact that you can make one choice or the other

69
00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:46.840
choice, it'll be interesting later. So, but now we will choose.

70
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.630
<v 1>One quick question, where, where did this Thailand come from?</v>

71
00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:55.470
Like I just imagine you can, you can just make it large. Exactly.

72
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.040
This wasn't a special thing, just a random one, just the random.

73
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.960
<v 0>And so now we're going to think,</v>

74
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.250
now we're going to discuss how you think about topics and gentlemen.

75
00:04:05.251 --> 00:04:08.160
So in particular, you'll see how you can generate a random talent or some more,

76
00:04:08.161 --> 00:04:12.750
something more interesting than this. And so graph is the glare on the plane.

77
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.870
It's a bunch of vertices connected by a bunch of edges.

78
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.370
And since it's in the plane, it also has this faces.

79
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:19.740
So this is like a face here.

80
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.420
And so what will be the vertices of the vertices will be the red lines actually

81
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.400
in New York city is blue, and it's also lined with subway, but

82
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.760
this, this didn't work out. So the red lines from the diverted, so this is a,

83
00:04:35.761 --> 00:04:39.180
and I put it in at the same height as a humid. So then,

84
00:04:39.181 --> 00:04:43.080
then there's BC D and so forth. And what are the ages?

85
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.900
The ages is when the square square five,

86
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.130
and it has a line at the top and the line, the bottom. So here,

87
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.000
the five is between a and C. And so five is this H here that connects a to C.

88
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.460
And so maybe this square seven, this is girls between C and F.

89
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.910
And so here's this edge seven seat in F. So the,

90
00:05:02.911 --> 00:05:07.590
the vertices are the horizontal lines. The squares are the edges.

91
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.300
And then the, the vertical lines, there are the faces like, like,

92
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.100
like look here. So there's a vertical line. It's surrounded by square seven, 11,

93
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.610
eight, and 12. So we'll look at this X here, seven and 11,

94
00:05:20.611 --> 00:05:24.600
there are seven 11 here, and eight and 12, they're on this,

95
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.750
on the other side of this vertical line. And now the most important thing.

96
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.040
How do you remember the actual size and positions of the squares?

97
00:05:32.041 --> 00:05:33.090
If you look at this graph.

98
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.770
<v 1>By the way, everyone, I did try to get the professor to use Brown paper,</v>

99
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.950
but he won the fields medal. He gets to do what he wants.

100
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.600
<v 0>The main thing is that we have to record to record the actual shape of this</v>

101
00:05:45.601 --> 00:05:48.870
picture. And we need to know what is the height?

102
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.880
What is the horizontal, what's the height of each of each horizontal line.

103
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.230
So we need to, there will be some equation on,

104
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.490
so we need to know the height of which like, for example, the height of which C,

105
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.100
which is the vertical coordinate of this horizontal line.

106
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.640
If I know this vertical core in that we know, we know this, this whole picture,

107
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.110
and what is the equation on this, on this height. If we look at the,

108
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.030
the length from here to here,

109
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.010
it's on the one hand is the size of this square with the square four,

110
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.980
plus the size of the square five, you know, the other hand,

111
00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:25.160
the size of the square seven plus the size of the square eight.

112
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.250
So the equation is the size of four claws.

113
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.330
This size five that is equal the size of seven,

114
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.870
the size of eight, but those sizes, what are they?

115
00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:40.190
So the size of the square five is the difference between the height of the,

116
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.400
of the line a and the height of the line C.

117
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.440
So we get the height of a mine is the

118
00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:53.180
height of C plus the same now for five, for the height of B

119
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.270
plus minus, uh, this is one of the bar on paper is good.

120
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.740
So mine is the hightest C,

121
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:09.620
and that is equal to the height of C minus the height

122
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.000
of, so now this,

123
00:07:11.001 --> 00:07:15.920
this F was the height of C minus the height of the other thing

124
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.990
is deep. And so when we rewrite this,

125
00:07:17.991 --> 00:07:22.460
we get the height of C is one quarter

126
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.370
of the height of the sum of height of all its neighbors.

127
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:30.440
Come from professors rearranging this, there's just rearranging this equality.

128
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:34.700
So the equality they call it, it that base, they, what comes from the, the,

129
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.930
the size of so squares that come from the top adapt to the same amount as

130
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:40.700
decide. This was quite a come from the bottom.

131
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.890
That becomes the equation that the height,

132
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.790
the height of this lot is the average of the height of this four line.

133
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.580
Or if you look at this graph, the value of the function,

134
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.930
and this verdict is the average of the value of dysfunction and all of its

135
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.170
neighbors. So that is, that is called, uh,

136
00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.300
such a function is called harmonic.

137
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.280
This is this a very important notion in math.

138
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.970
The result of this discussion is that a square tiling is,

139
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.990
is a graph and the plane together with a harmonic function on this graph,

140
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.290
harmonic function is the one that the value of it,

141
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.310
it each Vertex like the developer here should be the average of the,

142
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.850
of develop all of its neighbors. It's like, it's like if you think of, uh,

143
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:25.430
maybe people think of, uh, some social analogy where the, when the, the society,

144
00:08:25.431 --> 00:08:27.860
maybe there's a harmony in society,

145
00:08:27.861 --> 00:08:32.180
if what the person has is the average of all the

146
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:38.600
people he's connected with, and then maybe the society's in harmony or anyways,

147
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.150
harmonic functions are very important in, um,

148
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.780
in everything that has to do with two dimension. So like, like, uh,

149
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.690
any kind of mathematical physics that has to do with two dimensions,

150
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:52.670
they're important in, in electromagnetism and fluid mechanics and in all, uh,

151
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.370
all, uh, they also just so Kirmani functions,

152
00:08:56.371 --> 00:08:59.010
you can study in the discreet situation like here.

153
00:08:59.011 --> 00:09:00.910
So it's a kind of a graph and,

154
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.450
and something in the function and the purpose of the graph,

155
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.900
or you can study in the continuous and maybe in a continual doing the Brown

156
00:09:06.901 --> 00:09:11.100
paper before we go there, there is, uh, there is a very important notion of,

157
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.050
of which is illustrated in this picture.

158
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.170
There is a very nice notion of you have a graph in the plane.

159
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:20.130
Then there is a notion of a dual graph. And if you have a chromatic function,

160
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.550
then there is a notion of a conjugate harmonic function. Maybe we'll explain it,

161
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:27.420
maybe explain with this picture. And so what is the dual graph here?

162
00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:29.490
We made the choice. We made the choice.

163
00:09:29.491 --> 00:09:33.840
We decided the vertices of the graph are the horizontal lines and

164
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.160
edges are the squares, and the phases are the, are the vertical line.

165
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:39.540
But of course this,

166
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.750
the picture is completely symmetric between the horizontal and the vertical.

167
00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:45.750
If I just look sideways, what was horizontal, that becomes vertical.

168
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.090
And so in this picture in terms of graph,

169
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.630
that means the full of reality for graphs. If you have a graph and the plate,

170
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:52.883
then you can,

171
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.880
you can introduce a new word graph called duel divergence of the little graph or

172
00:09:56.881 --> 00:09:58.290
the faces of your original graph.

173
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.620
That would be the Vertex of the dual graph and will be another verdict of the

174
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.990
below the graph. And they're connected by an age.

175
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:07.590
If there's two phases we're sharing can age to begin with. Here's an example.

176
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.040
So what was a phase before it becomes a verdict?

177
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:16.320
What was an age stays in age and what was a Vertex now becomes a

178
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.720
phase? So this is the issue that is going around the face.

179
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:21.120
And if you had the harmonic function on the graph,

180
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.240
then there is a related function on the dual graph called the conjugate

181
00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:27.480
harmonic, which in this case, it's just the, so this is again,

182
00:10:27.481 --> 00:10:30.930
very simple to explain, instead of recording the height of the horizontal line,

183
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.080
you record the X scores in it of the vertical lines.

184
00:10:34.081 --> 00:10:36.630
That will be your contract term, Monica. So you say,

185
00:10:36.631 --> 00:10:40.980
this is the age number sentences. The one hit here. And since this is a square,

186
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.910
what we have here is that the change of the function of the high function within

187
00:10:44.911 --> 00:10:45.690
this divert,

188
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:49.410
this is equal to the change of the height function between the dual verts,

189
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.430
because that was a square. And as the general definition of a, or maybe we'll,

190
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.050
we'll do the rest on the Brown paper.

191
00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.200
<v 1>So professor, if I,</v>

192
00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.920
if I got out a ruler and measured all the distances of everything here, like,

193
00:11:00.921 --> 00:11:03.590
you know, to the, to the millimeter, you're saying,

194
00:11:03.591 --> 00:11:06.680
and I could feed them into these equations and everything. Exactly. Yeah,

195
00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:07.813
that'll be exactly.

196
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:13.130
So it's basically what you've done here is you did a tiling and then you've just

197
00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:16.100
shown me other ways to represent it. Right.

198
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.250
<v 0>But it's, it's, it's in reality. It's the other way. There's a, they're very,</v>

199
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:24.680
you can write that interesting graph and then you there'll be, uh, they'll be,

200
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:25.940
so then, then,

201
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.090
then you can study harmonic functions on this graph and her money functions on

202
00:11:29.091 --> 00:11:31.580
the graph. If you're, if you're trying to tie the whole plane,

203
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.160
you can imagine that the very, very large distances,

204
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.610
the Giro graph may look something like, Whoa, like a plane.

205
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:39.600
And so your function will look some, you know,

206
00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:42.890
maybe some continuous harmonic function and the, at the infinity. So this,

207
00:11:42.891 --> 00:11:44.450
this relates to, uh,

208
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.110
the relates to the notions of continuous harmonic functioning,

209
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:50.270
which we'll discuss it on the Brown paper in the second. And so this is,

210
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.980
this is, this is a fun,

211
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.690
this is combinatorial geometric way to think about her money clash.

212
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:58.960
So those sorts of way to parameterize the perimetry is the scrutiny.

213
00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.630
<v 1>So do people who are trying to come up with tilings, cause sometimes you'll see,</v>

214
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.140
Oh, some someone's come up with a clever new tiling. Are they using.

215
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.560
<v 0>Very classical? This is, this is, this is very classical,</v>

216
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:13.230
but this was known to the mathematicians for the longest time.

217
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:17.640
There's other very serious mathematics goes into figure out how,

218
00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:22.320
if you study some discreet structure, some load such as a square tiling, if, uh,

219
00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.620
or some may be, uh, some other combinatorial random structure,

220
00:12:25.621 --> 00:12:27.690
which are discrete and, uh,

221
00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.440
how in the very large distance on the various large scale, they will, they will,

222
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:33.120
uh, they will behave as,

223
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.210
as something we know from the continuum from her manufacturers were first

224
00:12:36.211 --> 00:12:37.350
introduced in the continuum.

225
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.890
And then they studied in like electrostatics electrostatic potential is an

226
00:12:40.891 --> 00:12:44.340
example of harmonic function. People, people studied it for, for what it is.

227
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:48.630
It's very interesting how this large scale continuous thing can emerge from,

228
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.520
from small scale discrete combinatorial things. And that is,

229
00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:56.970
and that is actually relates to, to some, um,

230
00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:59.790
to some very concrete problems in mathematical physics. There one,

231
00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.900
I think mathematical physics try to do is try to connect different scales.

232
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.480
Like for example, we know that the solids or liquids, both of them are,

233
00:13:08.481 --> 00:13:11.190
are really disputed microscopic scale. So there's something really,

234
00:13:11.191 --> 00:13:14.820
something happens on the microscopic sale. At the large scale, we see,

235
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:19.740
we see [inaudible] of hydrodynamics or other creations of continuous

236
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.650
mathematical physics. And it's challenged sometimes, sometimes.

237
00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.530
And these are sometimes very hard one for mathematicians to starting from

238
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.790
microscopic description, justify the, the macroscopic behavior. And one thing,

239
00:13:29.791 --> 00:13:30.624
which is really,

240
00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:35.550
it really helps if you can somehow reduce your microscopic problem or problem

241
00:13:35.551 --> 00:13:38.460
about sacred monic functions because harmonic functions,

242
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:39.540
they have a really nice,

243
00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:43.590
so if you have a harmonic functions on graphs and the graphs and the graph kind

244
00:13:43.591 --> 00:13:48.060
of approximate something continues by making, becoming denser and denser. Then,

245
00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:48.541
then you know,

246
00:13:48.541 --> 00:13:52.320
the harmonic function discrete one will converge to a harmonic function that

247
00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.660
continues now, suppose you have a continuous harmonic fund.

248
00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:59.310
And so we have a function of two variables and function F of X, Y,

249
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.660
and what is it called? Harmonic?

250
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.880
What's the continuous and the look of the property.

251
00:14:02.881 --> 00:14:06.240
We discussed that the value of the function at the new point is actually the

252
00:14:06.241 --> 00:14:10.530
average over its value over all of its maybe some distance neighbors,

253
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.110
or if you can, in fact, average over the disk.

254
00:14:13.111 --> 00:14:15.300
If I take the value at any point X,

255
00:14:15.301 --> 00:14:19.470
Y this is equal to the average of F over this whole disk,

256
00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:22.850
there's a continuous version. And the,

257
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:27.330
the basic property about harmonic functions in math is something that you prove

258
00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.520
in complex analysis. The fact they come in pairs,

259
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:34.350
they come in pairs is the real and imaginary you're part of in fact,

260
00:14:34.351 --> 00:14:35.880
the complex functional, like for example,

261
00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.520
if I take the function of the form X plus I,

262
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:41.130
which is I as the square root of minus one.

263
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:45.420
So this is the square root of minus one X plus Y

264
00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:50.250
squared. And then, then by the law of algebra,

265
00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:54.440
I'm going to get X square minus Y squared.

266
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:59.330
This is the part plus this I w X Y.

267
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:01.670
And so now it's a theory. No,

268
00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:05.330
not very easy to prove that both of these things are harmonic and moreover

269
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:09.410
they're conjugate in exactly the same sense as we discussed this, but the graph,

270
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.320
the level set of this functions, this is my function. Yeah.

271
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.070
And this is my function G and what are the levels of Z?

272
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.230
The levels of Judah hyperbolas like that? So this is,

273
00:15:19.231 --> 00:15:22.070
this is a level sense of gee. This is where X,

274
00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:26.300
Y for the constant and what are the levels sets of F level sets of half.

275
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:31.940
There there go, exactly perpendicular. And so then if I look at the,

276
00:15:31.941 --> 00:15:35.390
at the grade in the graduate and something which goes perpendicular to the level

277
00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.670
set, so maybe this is the gradient of G,

278
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:42.200
and this is the gradient of F they're exactly different something, but this I,

279
00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.960
this, I messed up. This is supposed to be exactly the same size.

280
00:15:44.961 --> 00:15:48.860
And they're perpendicular. This is a continuous version where we have here,

281
00:15:48.861 --> 00:15:49.940
the discreet here,

282
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:53.510
and they just create the two conjugate function where the height of the Curzon,

283
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:55.850
Tomas and the X coordinate of the vertical ones.

284
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.580
This function changes vertically by a certain amount.

285
00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:01.460
And the other function changes horizontally by exactly the same art.

286
00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:05.360
The gradients go exactly perpendicular. So that's a discreet version of bed. Oh,

287
00:16:05.361 --> 00:16:06.194
that's phenomenal.

288
00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:11.740
<v 2>So imagine a game with the following rules. Uh, we start with two numbers.</v>

289
00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:13.540
The sum of these numbers.

290
00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.780
<v 3>Will be more than 50 trillion, great mathematical publishment.</v>

291
00:16:16.781 --> 00:16:21.220
You really do things that you would not believe yourself are possible,

292
00:16:21.221 --> 00:16:22.600
and you have to find it within you.

293
00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:27.670
<v 2>No, I did not get it right. Uh, I, uh, well, you know, you win some,</v>

294
00:16:27.671 --> 00:16:31.720
you lose some, you, they make a bleak, blender

295
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:34.600
turns out he did not realize.
