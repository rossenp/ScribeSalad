00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.370
<v 0>We're going to calculate the blast radius of an atomic bomb, fortunately,</v>

2
00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:08.820
without dropping any atomic bombs, cause that's one way to do it.

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.620
And that was exactly how the U S military were doing this 1940s Manhattan

4
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:16.410
project, Los Alamos, all of that part of history,

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.900
interesting things happening in the physics and math world,

6
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.840
the U S military were doing all these experiments and we're making measurements

7
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.520
of as they changed the size of the bomb or certain weather conditions

8
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.720
as to how fast that sort of mushroom cloud would expand, of course,

9
00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:33.030
quite useful information. If you're dropping a bomb, you know,

10
00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:35.310
potentially near your own soldiers,

11
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.170
or there are certain areas you want to avoid,

12
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.070
you want to have an idea how much that's going to spread out pretty important

13
00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:44.970
information. And as because of the atomic bombs were so new back in the 1940s,

14
00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:46.110
we didn't really know this.

15
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.790
So it did require this like trial and error approach or it required the

16
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:55.020
clever mathematical approach. And so this is the story of GIA Taylor,

17
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.430
a British mathematician,

18
00:00:56.431 --> 00:01:00.360
who was asked by the UK government to help out during the world war.

19
00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:04.380
So he actually helped home world war one and world war two in world war II.

20
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.120
He was sent over as part of the British delegation to go and visit the test

21
00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:12.960
site, visit the Manhattan project. And he actually saw the first ever blast.

22
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.900
The Trinity test in 1945, he actually witnessed one of,

23
00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:17.310
I think there are only 10 people that were there.

24
00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:19.170
And one of them was this mathematician, GIA Taylor,

25
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.910
what he did using some photographs taken from the explosion was actually

26
00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:28.260
calculate the formula for the blast radius of the atomic bomb,

27
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.360
which at the time was a us military secret.

28
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.580
So da Taylor did these calculations or just published this in mathematical

29
00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:39.600
research journals.

30
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.430
And it was quoted as pretty embarrassing for the U S military at the time,

31
00:01:44.431 --> 00:01:48.450
because this was like the most closely guarded military secrets about the inner

32
00:01:48.451 --> 00:01:49.860
workings of an atomic bomb.

33
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.500
And then the spiritual annotation comes along and just kind of, you know,

34
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.860
does a pretty straightforward calculation as we'll see,

35
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.470
to just get the answers basically. So it's a very,

36
00:01:58.471 --> 00:02:03.180
very cool story and also uses possibly my favorite

37
00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:07.590
tool in all of applied maths, which is that of scaling analysis.

38
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.180
It's very, very applied.

39
00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:14.010
Maths should stress this because you kind of go into physics and think about

40
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.950
what is happening in a problem to them,

41
00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:20.280
write down the important parameters in your problem,

42
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.950
and then combine them in such a way to get the answer you want. So you,

43
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.190
so you do have to have that sort of, uh, very applied physicists,

44
00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:31.320
like mind to be able to use this,

45
00:02:31.321 --> 00:02:36.300
but it's such a good tool because you can calculate the formula for atomic

46
00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:40.350
bomb without setting off a single atomic bomb. And so the way Taylor did it,

47
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.221
first of all,

48
00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:46.140
what factors are going to influence the spreading rate of

49
00:02:46.141 --> 00:02:48.630
our bomb blast? First thing,

50
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.600
at least that came to my mind and to Taylor's mind was the energy.

51
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.830
You have a bigger bomb,

52
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.000
it's going to blow up more stuff it's reasonably straightforward to see.

53
00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.980
So we don't know whether that relationship is or anything yet,

54
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.030
but we know that the energy of the bomb is going to affect that blast radius.

55
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.790
So we're going to write down energy. We're going to label.

56
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.390
That's definitely one of the parameters it's going to be an AR problem. Now,

57
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:15.280
the other one that's reasonably obvious is time. If you just set your bum off,

58
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.300
it's not gone very far. If you wait a few seconds, it's gone a lot further.

59
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.960
We're trying to work out the radius of the blast. So as time increases,

60
00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:25.600
the radius will certainly increase. So we're going to have time,

61
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.040
which we label with a T and now the sort of real fluid

62
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:32.140
dynamics and physics comes into it.

63
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:34.840
And Taylor was a fluid dynamicist in Cambridge.

64
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.270
And this is where this really helped him because he thought about the problem as

65
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:39.910
follows. You have as the bomb detonates,

66
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.140
you have a huge amount of energy being released from a tiny,

67
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:47.170
tiny volume. And so you have a very,

68
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:50.020
almost instantaneous explosion from tiny,

69
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:52.630
tiny volume to massive amount of energy.

70
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.720
And what that's going to do is create a massive,

71
00:03:55.721 --> 00:04:00.490
massively high pressure within that explosion, that sort of cloud of your bomb.

72
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.290
So you can kind of think of it as if this is a sort of initial explosion

73
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.290
in here. If you take this to be pressure,

74
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.050
this is really high inside this region.

75
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.200
And as soon as you get out of the bond region,

76
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.590
the atmospheric pressure is really low. And you almost have like a,

77
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:18.910
what we would call a shock.

78
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.630
This is where the term shockwave comes from the shockwave of a blast because

79
00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:26.680
here you've got super high pressure from this giant explosion.

80
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:28.660
And here you've just got atmospheric pressure.

81
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.240
And these are like orders of magnitude different.

82
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.950
What this tells you is not what is important in the problem,

83
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.430
but what is not important. And this is the sort of the fluid dynamics,

84
00:04:39.431 --> 00:04:42.970
the physical intuition of, of these problems. And Taylor was a fluid.

85
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:44.200
Dynamicist the way he knew this.

86
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.290
So because this is so high and this is so small,

87
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.630
the pressure of the air is not going to play a role in

88
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.770
the expansion of the bomb.

89
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.770
So whether it's high pressure or low pressure weather system,

90
00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.430
it's not actually going to matter. So it tells you the pressure is crossed off.

91
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.760
If the air pressure isn't important, then you think, well,

92
00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:07.540
what are the properties of the air are going to affect the spread of the ball?

93
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.820
You would expect that to be a difference in the spreading rate,

94
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.050
depending on the fluid or the air that you're moving through.

95
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.100
The other possibilities are density and maybe temperature.

96
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.700
We have an equation releasing these two, it's called the ideal gas law.

97
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.260
And you often will model air as such. And it says that these two,

98
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.220
if the pressure is constant or negligible, these two just depend on each other.

99
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.540
So he just picked density.

100
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.730
So this sort of physical intuition told you pressure didn't

101
00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:37.420
matter. And that meant it had to be density.

102
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.110
That was the key insight that came from Taylor, being a fluid dynamic.

103
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.980
<v 1>The pressure of the, this atmosphere doesn't matter if it doesn't,</v>

104
00:05:43.981 --> 00:05:44.814
this pressure matters.

105
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:46.980
<v 0>This pressure will absolutely matter,</v>

106
00:05:46.981 --> 00:05:49.740
but this will basically be controlled by the energy.

107
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.990
This is the thing with scaling analysis.

108
00:05:51.991 --> 00:05:55.080
And it's a very good question because there are so many different things you can

109
00:05:55.081 --> 00:05:55.914
pack.

110
00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.650
And sometimes it is like black magic that you pick the right ones and put them

111
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:03.410
together in such a way. So I'm sure there are many,

112
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:06.140
many examples of scaling analysis not working,

113
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.790
but this just happens to be like possibly my favorite example of it working and

114
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:14.950
discovering a military secret. So we've got energy, we've got time.

115
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.890
And then we've got density density of the outside air,

116
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.240
which we labeled with RO the scaling analysis is what comes in here because what

117
00:06:22.241 --> 00:06:25.840
you do is you look at the units of your three parameters.

118
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.430
We denote this sort of square bracket in maths. So let's start with time.

119
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.480
Cause that's easy. The units of time are time, seconds,

120
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.600
and I'm going to just call it a time, which is a T now energy.

121
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.050
The way I remember the units of energy is to think of let's take my favorite

122
00:06:41.051 --> 00:06:42.160
energy kinetic energy.

123
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.030
So kinetic energy is half times mass times velocity squared.

124
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.750
So the units are a mass times.

125
00:06:49.751 --> 00:06:54.220
Velocity squared velocity is distance divided by time.

126
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.000
So that's distance over time squared.

127
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.340
So I now have a mask, uh,

128
00:07:00.341 --> 00:07:02.980
length squared over a time squared for the units for energy.

129
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.930
I've got just a T for time and density is a mass per length

130
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.890
cubed because we're working in 3d kilograms per meter cube, for example.

131
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.930
So we've now got the units of energy,

132
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:15.940
the units of time and the units of density.

133
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.910
And now the scaling analysis argument is to say, well,

134
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:23.350
I have determined through knowledge of physics and fluid dynamics as Taylor did

135
00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:23.490
that.

136
00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:28.000
These three are the most important parameters that I think control the blast

137
00:07:28.001 --> 00:07:31.630
radius. So if I can arrange these in such a way,

138
00:07:31.631 --> 00:07:36.550
the Tai get rid of the mass and get rid of time from the units and all

139
00:07:36.551 --> 00:07:38.140
I'm left with is a length.

140
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.550
That must be the radius because what other possible length could it be?

141
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:44.680
That's the kind of argument.

142
00:07:44.681 --> 00:07:49.120
And then of course you have to validate this and test this with some amount of

143
00:07:49.121 --> 00:07:52.150
experiments. So you don't need to do hundreds like the U S military,

144
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.930
but Taylor happened to have one or two photographs from that one test he went to

145
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.630
and he checked it against that and, and showed that it was correct.

146
00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:03.520
So what we just have to do now is combine the three sets of units in such a way

147
00:08:03.521 --> 00:08:06.820
that we just get linked. You got a mass, a length and a time.

148
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.850
So I think if we start by removing mass,

149
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:13.990
so if we do energy E divided by density row,

150
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:17.350
then that is equal to square brackets for units,

151
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:21.610
M L squared over T squared divided by the density,

152
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:26.110
puts an M on the bottom and an L cubed on top. So the AMS cancel.

153
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.100
And so this is equal to L to the five over T squared.

154
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.310
So now we've got rid of mass, which is very good, but we still have time.

155
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.040
So we get rid of time by introducing T.

156
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.410
So we just are going to have to multiply on the top by time squared.

157
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.590
And that gives us now with the time squared on the top,

158
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.100
we just have L to the five, cause it will cancel. Finally,

159
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.160
this is a length to the power of five. We just want to radius,

160
00:08:51.161 --> 00:08:54.910
which is just owl. So we just take the whole thing to the power of one.

161
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.880
So if we want our time dependent radius of an atomic bomb,

162
00:08:59.881 --> 00:09:04.470
the radius of the atomic bomb is proportional to the energy

163
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.790
to the one fifth,

164
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:10.800
the time after explosion to the two fifths and the air

165
00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:13.260
density to the minus one fifth.

166
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.810
And that right there was the most closely guarded secret in U S

167
00:09:18.811 --> 00:09:21.240
military in the 1940s.

168
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:25.310
<v 1>Had the U S military figured it out with mathematics or had they just used a</v>

169
00:09:25.311 --> 00:09:28.850
number of tests and sort of, you know, guests.

170
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:32.600
<v 0>Roughly. So, so if you were doing this experimentally, which is what they did,</v>

171
00:09:32.601 --> 00:09:36.650
you would do lots of different explosions and you would take measurements at

172
00:09:36.651 --> 00:09:40.700
different times as the thing is exploding and expanding. You'd make, take,

173
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.030
do it on different days with different ad densities and you'd use different

174
00:09:44.031 --> 00:09:46.730
sized bombs and you'd have all these data points.

175
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.860
And then you do sort of try and find a scaling that makes the data collapse

176
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:55.970
into a straight line. That's generally how you do applied maths research today.

177
00:09:55.971 --> 00:09:58.910
That's how I did my experiments during my research, in fact,

178
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.290
so you just get lots of data points and try and plug it all together and then

179
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:04.880
sort of it's kind of trial and error.

180
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.280
And as suddenly it perfectly fits this pattern.

181
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.070
<v 1>And Taylor was able to check, he got it, right?</v>

182
00:10:10.071 --> 00:10:13.070
Because he had a few pictures from the Trinity test, isn't it?

183
00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:15.410
<v 0>Yes, he did. He had these two pictures.</v>

184
00:10:15.411 --> 00:10:19.100
He actually published them in a magazine. And when he released this, this paper,

185
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:22.850
he published these two images. Um, and so he using, um,

186
00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.750
he could check this against, against these actual images to check the radius.

187
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:31.130
And of course, what we are missing here is there's going to be a constant here.

188
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:34.100
So this is proportional to so the units match up,

189
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:37.310
but you can still have a number in this gap.

190
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:41.180
And now that's the kind of thing you need to do experiments to get and tell you

191
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.340
that I only had the one to compare to.

192
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:47.630
And so I think he was trying to estimate the size of the bomb dropped in this

193
00:10:47.631 --> 00:10:51.850
Trinity test in 1945. And he believed it was 20 kilotons. Sorry.

194
00:10:51.851 --> 00:10:55.940
He believed it was 22 kilotons. And the actual size was 20,

195
00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.990
which given the, this that gets pretty good.

196
00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:04.640
Let's be honest given that he didn't have access to highly

197
00:11:04.641 --> 00:11:08.900
classified us military secrets. He was able to get with at a 10% accuracy,

198
00:11:08.901 --> 00:11:12.290
the size of the bomb that was dropped in that first ever nuclear test.

199
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.680
<v 1>This isn't going to help you build an atomic bomb. This is just,</v>

200
00:11:15.681 --> 00:11:18.350
this is just going to give you an idea of how devastating that could be.

201
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.250
Absolutely.

202
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:23.090
<v 0>So this, this would be one of the first things, given some new,</v>

203
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:26.510
some new weapon or some new even sort of like a new source of energy.

204
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:30.710
One of the first things you would want to do would be to try it at different

205
00:11:30.711 --> 00:11:33.770
values of energy, different sizes, different densities,

206
00:11:33.771 --> 00:11:38.270
and see what happens so that before you were able to actually use it safely.

207
00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.870
Well, I guess the bombs are really safe in a controlled way. Thank you.

208
00:11:41.871 --> 00:11:43.460
Without unintended circumstances,

209
00:11:43.461 --> 00:11:46.520
you would need to know this kind of information. So this was, as he said,

210
00:11:46.521 --> 00:11:51.380
this was literally done based on the first ever detonation of an atomic bomb.

211
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:52.820
<v 1>Is this constant,</v>

212
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:57.220
this no number here dependent on the type of bomb or would a T and T be

213
00:11:57.221 --> 00:11:58.330
different to an atomic bomb?

214
00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:02.430
<v 0>I believe so. That's the sort of the limitation of the scaling analysis.</v>

215
00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.660
Whilst you can get,

216
00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:07.860
which parameters are important and the powers of those parameters,

217
00:12:07.861 --> 00:12:09.390
you can never get that constant.

218
00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:12.030
<v 1>But once you've got the constant, it works for all the time.</v>

219
00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:14.100
<v 0>It bombs. Yeah. There's going to be some error,</v>

220
00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:18.120
absolutely going to be some error, but yes, once you have that constant,

221
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.880
it hopefully would hold for, for a particular,

222
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:22.650
at least a particular type of atomic bomb.

223
00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.190
You've had the same bomb and you dropped it and then you doubled your energy.

224
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:29.700
This would predict how much more the radius would be and you would absolutely

225
00:12:29.701 --> 00:12:31.800
expect that to follow. What does it tell us? Well,

226
00:12:31.801 --> 00:12:35.490
time is certainly increasing the most, in the sense of it has the highest power.

227
00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.820
If time doubles versus energy, double or density doubling,

228
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.580
you're going to see that the biggest change being a tight.

229
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.390
But what it does tells is as you increase the energy, the radius will increase.

230
00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:49.620
But it's also telling you here, if you were to go from eater East squared,

231
00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:52.710
you're only going to get quite a small increase in your radius.

232
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.330
So this one fifth is sort of saying that you really have to ramp up the

233
00:12:57.331 --> 00:13:00.720
energy to get that large radius where, you know,

234
00:13:00.721 --> 00:13:02.220
compared to this being a larger power,

235
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.630
because it's quite a small power and it's, and because the density is negative,

236
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.470
that's on the denominator. So as the density gets higher,

237
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:15.270
the radius decreases and that's always a good sanity check for these things.

238
00:13:15.271 --> 00:13:18.810
Making sense. If the energy goes up, you expect a bigger bomb.

239
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.440
If you wait longer, you expect a bigger radius.

240
00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.720
And if you increase the density of the app,

241
00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:26.940
do you imagine there's more water in the air? It's like thicker,

242
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:30.090
it's harder for the explosion to move through thicker air,

243
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.510
so you would expect it to shrink. So there's always that nice. As I said,

244
00:13:33.511 --> 00:13:38.310
a sanity check that it does make physical sense and mathematically the units

245
00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.140
balance, the scaling works, and then you would then need to do some expert,

246
00:13:42.141 --> 00:13:45.270
at least one experiment to get a grasp on that number.

247
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:50.070
But for the U S or the way you would think about it is the density of the air

248
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:54.120
is reasonably constant. So you're dropping the bomb in New Mexico.

249
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.930
The density in the summer will be approximately the same across the summer

250
00:13:57.931 --> 00:14:01.860
period. So you know that the time that just will constantly increase.

251
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.470
So the question would then be say,

252
00:14:04.471 --> 00:14:08.490
you wanted a bomb search that within two seconds of it being dropped,

253
00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:12.510
it had destroyed a one kilometer radius area.

254
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:17.160
You then plug in one kilometer as your radius. You say,

255
00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:20.310
I want within two seconds it to be gone. I plugged in my ad density.

256
00:14:20.311 --> 00:14:24.180
It tells you the size of the bomb. You have to drop to do that damage. So,

257
00:14:24.181 --> 00:14:26.670
so that's, those really is quite valuable information.

258
00:14:26.671 --> 00:14:30.390
If you're trying to do it like a controlled sort of targeted bomb.

259
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:34.500
<v 2>Releasing, and it produces two neutrons,</v>

260
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.540
each of which go on to react or to split other

261
00:14:39.541 --> 00:14:44.460
atoms of plutonium. So you'll get to chain reaction, hand,

262
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.670
the explosion just builds up and up and up.

263
00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:54.090
[inaudible].
