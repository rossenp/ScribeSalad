00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.470
<v 0>So I have here, this is a butterfly cold, a morpho butterfly.</v>

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.960
And I want to tell you what this butterfly,

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.730
my nail Polish and soap bubbles have to do with one another.

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.880
Um, and so I'm going to talk to you about the optics of structure, Pearl color.

5
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.880
So normal colors are based on pigments,

6
00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:27.260
where you have some colors of light that get absorbed in some that got

7
00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:30.890
reflected. Some things, this particular butterfly, for example,

8
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.160
use geometry as a way to generate color.

9
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.290
Let's start with us soap bubbles. So when you're looking at a soap bubble,

10
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.340
it sort of looks all shimmery and rainbow. And as you let it sit there,

11
00:00:43.341 --> 00:00:45.170
even if you're not doing anything to it,

12
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.550
the colors change and they go through different rainbow colors.

13
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.810
So soap films are made out of something called surfactants.

14
00:00:52.811 --> 00:00:54.350
So the reason soap works is,

15
00:00:54.351 --> 00:00:58.790
but you've got oils on your skin and you want to wash them away with water.

16
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.140
So you have to have a molecule that has some, um,

17
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.180
oil favoring portion and some water favoring portion,

18
00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:12.350
and they have to be stuck together. So these are things that are like liquids.

19
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.710
So when a soap film, I've got little molecules,

20
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.570
these little head dots, they like water. These inside parts are fatty tail,

21
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.930
and then they assemble into layers like this.

22
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.400
And then I'm going to end up with water up here, water in here,

23
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.540
water down here.

24
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.700
So it turns out that this structure is enough to get all of those interesting

25
00:01:34.701 --> 00:01:38.570
colors out. So let's sort of break this down. So imagine I have,

26
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.630
I have a bunch of wares like this,

27
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.570
and they are some distance D apart.

28
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.810
I'm going to send in some wave of light.

29
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.400
So it comes in and some of it gets reflected.

30
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.670
So it says angle data. And then this is also angle theta.

31
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.520
So things get reflected by the same angle.

32
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.550
Some of it's going to keep on passing through,

33
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.160
and this again is angle feta.

34
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.020
And then it's going to bounce out at angle theta and come back out

35
00:02:09.021 --> 00:02:09.854
here.

36
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.180
So now I've got two waves of white that have traveled in different distance.

37
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.490
And for us to be able to see them,

38
00:02:16.491 --> 00:02:19.700
we need them to make sure that they're both in the same phase.

39
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.940
So if I had two waves of light,

40
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.650
let's say like this and one like this, and I want to add them together.

41
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.960
This one, I got nothing.

42
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.270
So the peak up here cancels with the trough down here, and I got nothing.

43
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.280
So for me to see anything,

44
00:02:37.281 --> 00:02:41.390
they both need to have peaks in the same place

45
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.850
and troughs in the same place.

46
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.800
And everything we're going to look at is the distance between neighboring

47
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.060
peaks. And this is the wavelength and we're going to call it Lambda.

48
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.740
So we want to add these two together to get a more

49
00:02:57.741 --> 00:03:01.630
intense signal. Okay?

50
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:06.360
So what we'll do get out of this is a condition on the white,

51
00:03:06.361 --> 00:03:10.980
so that we see a certain wavelength and that's going to be a function of the

52
00:03:10.981 --> 00:03:14.070
distance and the angle. So we're going to work this out.

53
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.350
So now let me label some points on here.

54
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.170
Let's see the wave travels in like this,

55
00:03:19.171 --> 00:03:21.570
where it intersects the first one I'm going to call this point.

56
00:03:21.571 --> 00:03:25.200
A point B is going to be the second place

57
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.200
it intersects. And then point C is going to be the reflected,

58
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.700
the first reflected bounce.

59
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.050
And then I'm going to draw a right angled line up here.

60
00:03:37.051 --> 00:03:39.600
So this is a right angle with this,

61
00:03:39.601 --> 00:03:44.160
and it's going to intersect this original beam at point

62
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.353
D.

63
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.190
Now what we're going to do is we want a condition that the light is going to

64
00:03:50.191 --> 00:03:51.990
have traveled in here,

65
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.680
bounced off and goes from a to D and then the light down here,

66
00:03:55.681 --> 00:03:59.850
it's going to have traveled from a to B to C.

67
00:03:59.851 --> 00:04:04.140
And we want to make sure that it's in phase at the same point and gets to Dean.

68
00:04:04.141 --> 00:04:07.440
And at the same point, it gets to see that's going to give us a condition.

69
00:04:07.441 --> 00:04:10.950
And that condition is that the distance it travels on the bottom.

70
00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:15.580
So that's going to be length AB plus the length

71
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.000
VC is going to be some multiple of

72
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.110
an Lambda plus the distance from a to D.

73
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.960
So we're going to do this using a little bit of trig.

74
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.430
So I'm going to write down the right triangle here,

75
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.570
and then that'll be everything we need to know. So this is my right angle,

76
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.410
and this is angle feta. It has a high pot nous.

77
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.300
H what I know is that this bottom leg here is going to

78
00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:47.940
be H times co-sign feta.

79
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.770
And the vertical line here is going to be each time sine theta using this

80
00:04:52.771 --> 00:04:56.070
triangle. We're going to work out exactly what these distances are.

81
00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.870
So our first triangle we're going to look at is a B,

82
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.780
and then the right triangle that's down here.

83
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.790
So I know that this vertical distance is length D that's the

84
00:05:08.791 --> 00:05:10.470
distance between my layers of soap.

85
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.520
So what I know is that the length D is equal

86
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.470
to the length a B times sign of data.

87
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.420
So that's one condition that tells us that length AB is equal

88
00:05:24.421 --> 00:05:28.290
to D divided by sine of data. Okay?

89
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.150
So now we need to figure out what the length from a to D

90
00:05:33.151 --> 00:05:36.150
is. And so we've got another right triangle here.

91
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.160
So now I know that the length from a to C is the hypotenuse of

92
00:05:41.161 --> 00:05:44.280
this triangle. So that tells me the length,

93
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.330
a D is equal to the length a C

94
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.460
times in this case,

95
00:05:50.461 --> 00:05:53.850
this is going to be co-sign of the angle.

96
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.070
So this is co-sign feta. So now let's work out what AC is.

97
00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.150
So we almost have this,

98
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:02.810
we can go back to this triangle that we started with here.

99
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.880
What we know is that half the length from a to C is the

100
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:11.630
length from this intersection to B.

101
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.100
And so we can use our right triangle again to solve this.

102
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.230
So we know that the length a B is the high pot news.

103
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.910
So half of the length from a to C is going to

104
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:30.500
be a B times co-sign of the angle theta. Okay,

105
00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:31.880
so now let's put this together.

106
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.440
So we got a D is equal to two,

107
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.890
a B co-sign theta squared.

108
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.230
So now we know what this distance is,

109
00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:44.900
and we know that AB and BC are the same distance.

110
00:06:44.901 --> 00:06:48.080
So this gives us a way of relating, uh,

111
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.280
the distance di to the angle of incoming light

112
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.060
and the wavelength of the light and the wavelength of the light is what gives us

113
00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.040
that color. I guess I should write out the final equation. Two D times,

114
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.730
sine theta is equal to N times Lambda.

115
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.890
So Lambda is the wavelength of light,

116
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:10.130
and that determines the color D is the thickness of layers.

117
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:14.600
And feta is the incoming light. The soap films are filled with water,

118
00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:17.240
and the water is constantly draining out of it. And so that's,

119
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.120
the layers are getting closer and closer and closer together.

120
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.720
And what you're seeing is that as the layer thicknesses change,

121
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:27.980
you're going through this whole rainbow spectrum of colors.

122
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:33.200
So why don't we see this in everything to make these layers,

123
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.410
this kind of size, it's pretty special.

124
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:41.240
So wavelengths of light are in the hundreds of nanometers.

125
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.940
The periodicity in a crystal is in 0.1 nanometers.

126
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.950
That's a thousand times different from each other.

127
00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:53.600
So how is biology going to get something with a really regular

128
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:54.950
patterning like this?

129
00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:58.370
And it turns out that what biology does is it turns to these things called

130
00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:02.930
minimal surfaces. So this is the ideal shape of a soap film.

131
00:08:02.931 --> 00:08:05.360
If you stretch it across some boundaries.

132
00:08:05.361 --> 00:08:07.730
So this is something that's really easy for nature to make,

133
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:12.770
because cell membranes are basically just fancy soap films. Um,

134
00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:17.240
so it can use this idea to pattern a structures that are a

135
00:08:17.241 --> 00:08:18.500
specific wavelength.

136
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:23.120
And it turns up with the structure that's used in the morpho butterfly that

137
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.760
sitting right here is something that's called a gyroid.

138
00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:30.020
And I've got a model of a gyroid in my bag to show you.

139
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:35.350
<v 1>It's got yarn stuck to it.</v>

140
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:40.210
<v 0>So this is a 3d printed model of a jar, right? So this is really,</v>

141
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.550
really intricate surface,

142
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:47.500
but it's really something that's quite easy to make just from soap membranes.

143
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.060
And this is the structure.

144
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:53.980
It can set the periodicity of the layers here to the right kind

145
00:08:53.981 --> 00:08:57.060
of blue that you're seeing in that butterfly.

146
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:03.740
<v 3>So what's the butterfly making gyros out of, cause it hasn't got soap in it.</v>

147
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:08.300
<v 0>I mean really far on a butterfly wing, you get wing scales,</v>

148
00:09:08.301 --> 00:09:12.020
these little pillars that have shapes in them.

149
00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:16.760
And if you zoom inside those, each one of those was once a cell.

150
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.620
So it had a living cell membrane.

151
00:09:18.621 --> 00:09:23.360
So the cell membrane takes the shape and then infills

152
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:28.400
half of it with a protein called chitin. And then after the several dies,

153
00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.770
the cell membrane gets stripped away.

154
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:35.300
But what you're left with is a protein that has this template into it,

155
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.200
and that's, what's giving it this color. And it's really this complicated,

156
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:43.370
beautiful surface that's giving this really

157
00:09:43.371 --> 00:09:46.070
striking blue to this butterfly.

158
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.760
<v 3>Do that diagram again for the butterfly,</v>

159
00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.610
all the numbers would work out to give us the wave length of.

160
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:58.310
<v 0>Yeah. And so one thing that you might notice is that in the soap film,</v>

161
00:09:58.311 --> 00:10:03.050
you really saw a lot of rainbows and this it's pretty similar

162
00:10:03.051 --> 00:10:04.850
color when I tilted around.

163
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.240
So you'll notice that it gets a little bit more or less intense,

164
00:10:08.241 --> 00:10:10.700
but the color itself doesn't change.

165
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.220
And that's something we didn't see with a soap film.

166
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:17.090
So the soap film that angle really matters.

167
00:10:17.091 --> 00:10:21.020
And so something about using this kind of structure is it has

168
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:25.460
repeated angular structure, but when you come in at different angles,

169
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:30.620
it behaves a little bit like it's all layers and all the same direction.

170
00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.420
<v 3>And what's happening with your nail Polish.</v>

171
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.530
<v 0>Yeah. So my nail Polish is something that's called a diffraction grading.</v>

172
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:41.080
So it's not quite the same thing. It turns out it's a polypropylene,

173
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.460
it's a polymer, that's doing all of this,

174
00:10:43.461 --> 00:10:48.410
but it's effectively a film that has a bunch of, um,

175
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:51.290
a bunch of repeated layers in it.

176
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.840
And instead of it being layers this way,

177
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:58.400
there are layers this way and that's reflecting light off differently in

178
00:10:58.401 --> 00:11:02.180
different angles. And it's exactly the same optics that's going on.

179
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.910
<v 3>Were you impressed that I had one of those butterflies ready for you?</v>

180
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.630
<v 0>Absolutely. That was fantastic.</v>

181
00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.300
<v 3>We didn't even play on that. I just had that on the wall.</v>

182
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:27.350
<v 0>Yeah. And it's exactly the right butterfly. It's beautiful. Butterfly.</v>

183
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:33.740
<v 3>Just think when that butterfly came to it's an unexpected demise.</v>

184
00:11:33.741 --> 00:11:35.540
It didn't know it was going to be in a number four video.

185
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:38.930
<v 0>Yeah. Well now it's famous.</v>

186
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.090
<v 3>It doesn't do it much. Good though. Does it.</v>

187
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.540
<v 0>Poor butterfly? It's beautiful.</v>

188
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:49.010
<v 3>Well, this man doesn't know about moths and butterflies, isn't worth knowing.</v>

189
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.160
And the collection they have here is extraordinary.

190
00:11:52.161 --> 00:11:54.920
We couldn't possibly look at them all, but let's look at Sam.
