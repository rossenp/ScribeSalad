00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.480
<v 0>We're going to discuss a little bit about knots and links.</v>

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.540
How about how to use coloring knots and links to study than me.

3
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:09.531
<v 1>I'll take,</v>

4
00:00:09.531 --> 00:00:13.430
say a piece of string and I'll projected on a Blackboard or a piece of paper.

5
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.100
That's called a projection of a nod. And you see,

6
00:00:16.101 --> 00:00:18.830
when I projected there are overs and unders that,

7
00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:22.670
tell me how it looked when it was back in three dimensional space. Now,

8
00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:26.360
of course you could think of a piece of string as just going like a line,

9
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.740
but in mathematics,

10
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.250
it's convenient to take the two ends of the string and connect them together.

11
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.880
So that forms a circle all the way around, right? If you don't stick,

12
00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:36.470
the two ends together, you could, of course,

13
00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:39.320
always a not something just by pulling the strand through.

14
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.640
And I'm trying to avoid doing that so that I can talk about when two knots are

15
00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:44.120
different,

16
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.480
it looks like a circle in the sense that if I had a little ant sitting on this,

17
00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:49.460
for example, here's my little land.

18
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.840
It would walk around this way and then they keep going and keep going and keep

19
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.910
going. And then he would come back.

20
00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.350
Gradually he or she actually it's chief in case of ants would come back to where

21
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.560
she was at the very beginning. And that's what makes it a circle.

22
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.430
But it's a complicated circle in that. It's not just like this, right?

23
00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:10.310
This would be what we call the trivial nod or the unknown,

24
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.780
which has no Noddings.

25
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.400
This is a not in the sense that you can't get from this picture to this picture

26
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.930
without doing something,

27
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.710
this continuous like cutting the nod or something like that in mathematics,

28
00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:24.800
we're interested in studying classification of knots. How,

29
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.150
what can you say about nods? How many are there with S with a certain level of,

30
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.950
of Noddings and things like that?

31
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.620
How do you actually prove that these two knots are different?

32
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.170
It's not so obvious. In other words, you notice that when you're a kid,

33
00:01:36.171 --> 00:01:37.610
for example, I love to do it.

34
00:01:37.611 --> 00:01:41.600
When I was a kid you'd like taking some piece of string making it look like it's

35
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.340
really complicated, oddly nodded.

36
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.060
And then you fool the adults by showing that it just yanks out. Right?

37
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.570
So how do you know that isn't true of this or that you couldn't get from this to

38
00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:55.160
this by doing something like making it much more complicated and then somehow

39
00:01:55.161 --> 00:01:58.880
yanking it out. In fact, we can prove that there's no way to go from this,

40
00:01:58.881 --> 00:02:02.690
to this beyond that. And this not, this thought is called the trefoil knot.

41
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.090
It's the first non-trivial knob.

42
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.480
And how do you prove that there's no way to go from this to this, right?

43
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.630
How do you know that if you did a zillion ways of moving it around,

44
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.100
the Noddings wouldn't come up.

45
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.850
<v 0>So out, right? It's like just making it is not enough and like fiddling around.</v>

46
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.390
<v 1>Right? Right. You could say, why don't you just count the number of crossings,</v>

47
00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:20.780
right?

48
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.470
The trouble is you can change the number of crossings in various ways in a, not.

49
00:02:24.471 --> 00:02:28.670
So this knot has three crossings where there's an over going on top of an under

50
00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:31.250
there's one over here. There's another one over here.

51
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.960
And there's another one over here.

52
00:02:32.961 --> 00:02:37.670
So there are three places where one strand lies on top of another like that.

53
00:02:37.671 --> 00:02:39.980
So you could say, why don't you just count the number of crossings?

54
00:02:39.981 --> 00:02:42.920
This one has zero crossings. This one has three crossings.

55
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.240
And it is true that the minimum number of crossings you need for this one is

56
00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:50.030
three. And for this one, the number of crossings is zero.

57
00:02:50.031 --> 00:02:53.270
But the trouble is that you can change the coursing numbers. For example,

58
00:02:53.271 --> 00:02:55.340
a simple, dumb bunny way to change.

59
00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:59.740
The crossing numbers is introduced into a piece of a, not a pig like that,

60
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.480
which obviously he could yank out, right?

61
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.130
There are three basic ways that you can introduce more crossings in an art.

62
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.430
Those are called the writer mice to moves. This is the first one,

63
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:12.760
the simplest one. And there are two more that involve more strands.

64
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.230
And the problem is that the right of mice to move seem to increase the number of

65
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:19.780
crossings, but you can do the opposite and decrease.

66
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.830
And so you haven't solved the problem of why can't you get rid of all the

67
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:25.870
crossings by doing a lot of these right of mice.

68
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:29.620
The moves may be first complicated and make a million crossings,

69
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.990
but then yank it out and get down to zero. So what I mean,

70
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.230
is that just like a cosmetic crossing or is it like a lifetime crossing?

71
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.470
Absolutely. That's the issue. Now, let me draw a few of the other rider, mice,

72
00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:39.190
the moves,

73
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.660
and any motion of a knot can be broken up into a series of these simple

74
00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:47.500
motions. So this is one, the pig tail would, you could yank out,

75
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.920
you could yak the pig tail out to just get a straight line, for example,

76
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.000
and the segment of the knot,

77
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.180
or you could have two segments of the knot that are, for example,

78
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.030
not doing anything at all, lying next to each other.

79
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.800
And then you pull one strand over the other ones.

80
00:04:00.801 --> 00:04:04.690
So you would take this and you could move it so that it would look for example,

81
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:09.640
like this with one strand logoing over and the other one just going always

82
00:04:09.641 --> 00:04:13.330
under. And obviously you could yank this back to look like that, right.

83
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.180
Or vice versa. So that's the right of my strategic.

84
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.480
And there's one more complicated motion to our three,

85
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.460
which involves three strands. And there, what you do is you have two strands.

86
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.140
One is crossing over the other and a third strand comes in and then

87
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.850
goes, let's say over both of them say like that. So this looks like this.

88
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.120
And then what I could do when I have three strands, for example,

89
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.990
I could move it to a picture where this guy that's going always over,

90
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.170
moves over, further up. Instead of down here,

91
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.890
he could move over here over all of them like that. Get what I mean.

92
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.610
And now obviously I could do that by just pulling the third strand higher.

93
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.100
So that's our three. So those are obvious,

94
00:04:54.101 --> 00:04:57.340
simple moves that you can do and change the projection of a knot.

95
00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.570
And now the question is,

96
00:04:58.571 --> 00:05:02.350
how do you prove that there's no way to go from the trefoil dock to the I'm not

97
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.560
using these simple moves or to give another example.

98
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.720
There's a simple knot called the figure eight.

99
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.090
And you see it's going to have in the middle,

100
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.090
something that looks like a figure eight, roughly

101
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.860
This one has zero crossings. This one has three crossings.

102
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.340
This one let's count them as one.

103
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.620
<v 2>Two, three.</v>

104
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.470
<v 1>For crossings. This is a for crossing that.</v>

105
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.450
And one can prove that actually not only is there no way to go from this

106
00:05:33.451 --> 00:05:37.560
one to the unknot, but also these are two different knots. In other words,

107
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.960
just by moving this around without cutting it,

108
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.190
there's no way to go from the trefoil to the figure eight or the figure eight to

109
00:05:44.191 --> 00:05:48.360
the trefle. So the, here we have an example already right away of three,

110
00:05:48.361 --> 00:05:52.230
really different knots. We can complicate them by doing these motions, right?

111
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:53.123
Or mice, the moves.

112
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.070
We could might try to simplify them by other right of mice to moves.

113
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.120
But in fact, matter how many zillions of moves we make?

114
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.810
These three are all different and there's no way to go from one to the other,

115
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.190
right?

116
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.100
<v 3>As a professor, it feels like these ride a Meister moves.</v>

117
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.960
They're like cosmetic moves.

118
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.320
<v 1>That's right. They don't change the underlying type of the nod.</v>

119
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.290
They changed the way it sits in three-dimensional space,

120
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.030
but they're equivalent to each other.

121
00:06:16.031 --> 00:06:19.810
We as not in the sense that one can be deformed continuously to the other

122
00:06:19.811 --> 00:06:22.450
without cutting it. There are tables of knots,

123
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.620
which tabulate knots by the minimum number of crossings. So this is the only,

124
00:06:26.621 --> 00:06:29.710
not with zero crossings. This is the first non trivial,

125
00:06:29.711 --> 00:06:33.850
not the one that's not the unknown is the trefle, Knotel three crossings.

126
00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.330
This is the one with four crossings. There are two with five crossings.

127
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.150
And then the number of knots begins to go up very fast.

128
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.970
By the time you're up into say 12 crossing knots,

129
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.130
you've got tens of thousands of them. And so on

130
00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.460
The question is how do you prove that they're different from each other? Now,

131
00:07:00.461 --> 00:07:03.790
mathematicians have a whole bunch of different methods of doing that.

132
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.360
Using geometry, using algebra, using a bunch of different ideas,

133
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.590
but there's a very, pretty old idea that can be explained to, you know,

134
00:07:11.591 --> 00:07:14.050
bright high school students by using coloring of knots.

135
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.860
And that's what I propose to show you because it's very visual and you can just

136
00:07:17.861 --> 00:07:21.970
see it. So the idea is the following. I'm going to consider the problem problem.

137
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.390
And for simplicity, I'm just going to be working with three colors.

138
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.190
So what do I mean by three coloring?

139
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.970
I mean that when I take a projection of a knot like this picture over here,

140
00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.650
I'm going to color each of the apparent segments that I see on the,

141
00:07:34.651 --> 00:07:39.250
the projection. So for example, in this case, because I had four crossings,

142
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.820
they look like there are four segments over here where it's unbroken.

143
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:46.360
There's one here. And there's another one that goes all the way around here.

144
00:07:46.361 --> 00:07:47.530
And another one here.

145
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.100
And so on four crossings gave me four segments that is broken up into,

146
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.550
and I'm going to try to color the, not using three different colors.

147
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:59.560
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to try coloring it in a way so that with

148
00:07:59.561 --> 00:08:01.960
a certain rules about how I'm allowed to color it.

149
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.090
And then I'll see that with these rules,

150
00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:08.320
some knots can be three colored and some knots cannot be three colored.

151
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.660
And that's going to let me distinguish one kind of,

152
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:15.250
not from another kind of not. So I'll be dividing the, the knots into two kinds.

153
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.570
Those which can be three colored and those which cannot be three colored. Now,

154
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.780
that's not a way of telling all knots apart,

155
00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:26.050
cause it's kind of crude that I'm only dividing them up into two sets,

156
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.810
but still it'll tell me that some of them are not equal,

157
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:30.640
cannot be the form to the other ones.

158
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:33.160
Now I have to have a rule because if I have no rule,

159
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:36.070
anything could be colored with three colors and then I'm not gaining any

160
00:08:36.071 --> 00:08:38.140
information. So I have to have a rule,

161
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:42.400
but I want to have a rule that's compatible with my right or my S the moves in

162
00:08:42.401 --> 00:08:45.160
the sense that if I could call her a not before,

163
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.910
there's an obvious way to then color it. After I do one of these right or mice,

164
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
the moves. So when I get to a crossing, there's an over one.

165
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.400
And then there are two unders one coming in the other side, one at a crossing.

166
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.270
I will see three colors because I will have the color of the over.

167
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:01.860
And then the two wonders coming there.

168
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.870
So I have to have three different colors here,

169
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.020
and I have to have some rule limiting what happens at a crossing.

170
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.200
One obvious rule to try to use is say, well,

171
00:09:10.201 --> 00:09:14.160
since I'm trying to do this with three colors and at a crossing,

172
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.400
there are three strands coming together. The two wonders and the over,

173
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.910
maybe the rules should just be at a crossing point like this,

174
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.010
you get all three different colors.

175
00:09:23.011 --> 00:09:26.430
That seems like the obvious rule to try insist that at a crossing,

176
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.040
it looks something like blue over here,

177
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.940
red over here and say green.

178
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.890
And I do those three colors together.

179
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:39.000
And that would be the rule to have that's a natural first guess it almost works,

180
00:09:39.001 --> 00:09:41.730
but not quite being the reason that doesn't quite work.

181
00:09:41.731 --> 00:09:45.390
You can see already because I has to be compatible with these rider mice,

182
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.610
the moves that as I do the right of mice, the moves,

183
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:52.410
the coloration or the color ability is maintained as I do them. Now,

184
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.990
if I do, for example, even just the pigtail.

185
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.340
So I start off with a single strand like that, and then I take the strand.

186
00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:02.340
So this is somewhere in a big knock diagram, somewhere in it.

187
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.470
And I take this pigtail and that,

188
00:10:04.471 --> 00:10:07.410
of course I can yank out and go back to what I had before.

189
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.020
So I can go back and forth between these two.

190
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.370
But notice what happens that at the crossing I'm coming in from somewhere other

191
00:10:14.371 --> 00:10:18.780
stuff and the not. So I'm becoming in blue and I'm going out blue. Well,

192
00:10:18.781 --> 00:10:20.970
that's it. Then I've gotta be blue all the way.

193
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.440
So you can see that at this crossing that I've introduced with the pig tail in

194
00:10:25.441 --> 00:10:29.400
order to make it compatible with what I had before, I have no choice,

195
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:34.110
but to allow it to crossing all three colors, to be the same at that crossing.

196
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:38.220
So I'm going to modify my first guests for the possibility that all three are

197
00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:39.010
the same,

198
00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:43.770
how tentative new rule is going to be all three different or all

199
00:10:43.771 --> 00:10:48.420
three the same. Okay. And that's a rule which we can check now,

200
00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.320
case by case is compatible with these right or mice, the moves.

201
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.800
And now I do the second rider, my second rule, and the second rider,

202
00:10:55.801 --> 00:11:00.180
nicely move consisted of pulling one of these over the other I'm coming in from

203
00:11:00.181 --> 00:11:03.450
elsewhere in the knots. So I can't change the ends of this. So I've,

204
00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:06.960
I'm now I'm going to have a, one of this is coming in blue.

205
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.410
The other one is still coming in red also. And in fact,

206
00:11:10.411 --> 00:11:11.820
they've got to go out the same way,

207
00:11:11.821 --> 00:11:14.700
the fit with what's going on elsewhere in the not. So here,

208
00:11:14.701 --> 00:11:15.960
this is going to go out red,

209
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.260
and this is still going to go out blue like it did before over here.

210
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.510
But what happens in between, well,

211
00:11:21.511 --> 00:11:26.190
in between this red guy goes over here and comes over in this right.

212
00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:30.150
Or mice that move here and then goes back here and connects up here. Fine.

213
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.900
This one is going to continue all the way down. And then of course,

214
00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:36.150
that's something I could yank out by the second, right.

215
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:38.760
Or mice to move just by pulling this back over there.

216
00:11:38.761 --> 00:11:41.640
And then I would get my original picture, but see what happens.

217
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.610
Remember my rule was that, of course, all three are different,

218
00:11:44.611 --> 00:11:48.240
rural three of the same. So at this crossing I have here blue and red.

219
00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.640
So now I've got to get green coming out of there.

220
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.670
I have green coming out of there coming down here and here's green. Ah,

221
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.960
and now I'm in luck because there's green and red and blue coming together.

222
00:11:58.961 --> 00:12:02.010
And that's compatible yeah. With my rule, because at that crossing,

223
00:12:02.011 --> 00:12:02.844
all three are different.

224
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:08.040
So we see that this rule is compatible with the first right of mice to move

225
00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.470
the second right of mice to move. And in fact,

226
00:12:10.471 --> 00:12:13.350
we could check more cases to see that it's compatible the third one.

227
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.980
So this property of being colorable with this rule stays the same as I do

228
00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.350
all three of the writer, Meister moves with me.

229
00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:27.570
And now I want to have another trivial coloring by non-trivial coloring. I mean,

230
00:12:27.571 --> 00:12:28.770
with more than one color.

231
00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.870
So the question I'm going to ask myself is which knots have a CRE coloring with

232
00:12:33.871 --> 00:12:38.010
this rule with more than one color. Of course, every not has the silly color,

233
00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:41.670
the trivial coloring, right color it all one color. So that's not of interest,

234
00:12:41.671 --> 00:12:44.070
but I want to do it with more than one color. Okay.

235
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:48.750
And now you'll notice that this one, the unknot does,

236
00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.840
I can only call it a one color because there were no crossings.

237
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:56.610
So this does not have a non-trivial coloring. This has only a silly coloring.

238
00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.020
And as I move it around,

239
00:12:58.021 --> 00:13:00.390
that's where I'm going to keep getting is that silly coloring.

240
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.030
And I'm not going to be able to color it with different colors,

241
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:06.810
no matter how I move it, I will not be able to color it. Non trivially, uh,

242
00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:11.310
subject to this rule. Let's look at the Treflan C is the trefoil colorable.

243
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:16.020
Well, okay. So for example, this strand over here is going to be red.

244
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.200
Then there's going to be another strand, which is going to be blue.

245
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.960
Let's say this one, look, and then there's going to be a strand.

246
00:13:21.961 --> 00:13:26.490
That's going to be green. Let's say this one. And now lo and behold,

247
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.270
you'll notice that at each of the crossings, we have all three colors.

248
00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:32.160
So this Treflan not.

249
00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.880
Haha great success is in fact three colorable.

250
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:38.190
This is an example of a three colorable not,

251
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.350
and this one is not three colorable.

252
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:43.860
And the last one we're going to consider today is the figure. Eight,

253
00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:48.030
not suppose that this trend was red. And then this strand let's say was green.

254
00:13:48.031 --> 00:13:52.350
Let's say, well, if this strand is red and this one is green, then this one,

255
00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:55.890
because it's the third one where they meet here would have to be blue.

256
00:13:55.891 --> 00:13:58.710
So this one would be blue over here. Well,

257
00:13:58.711 --> 00:14:01.890
if this one is blue and this one is red,

258
00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:06.420
then this one over here also has to be green because these three are me meeting

259
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.310
at them pointed. That was our coloring rule.

260
00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.100
That they either have to be all three different or the same.

261
00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:14.550
But if this one is green and this one is green,

262
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.010
then these two greens meet at this point.

263
00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:19.500
So the third one would have to be the same color.

264
00:14:19.501 --> 00:14:21.420
Remember all three different rural three, the same.

265
00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.350
So we'd have to have green here, but that contradicts that this guy was red.

266
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:29.790
So we see that this one is not three colorable by this simple technique of

267
00:14:29.791 --> 00:14:31.350
studying three color ability.

268
00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:36.600
We have proved that the trefoil and the figure eight knot are not the same

269
00:14:36.601 --> 00:14:40.380
because one of them is three colorable. One of them is not three colorable.

270
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:44.970
What we haven't succeeded at proving is we haven't yet proved that the figure

271
00:14:44.971 --> 00:14:46.980
eight knot doesn't or not,

272
00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:50.400
because all we know about the figure eight knot is that it's not three

273
00:14:50.401 --> 00:14:53.900
colorable. And that happened also to be true about the trivial nod.

274
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.960
So we haven't yet proved that these two guys are different.

275
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.480
We've proven that they're all different from the trefoil,

276
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.610
but we haven't yet succeeded at showing,

277
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.800
but I could generalize this trick on a little,

278
00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:08.150
slightly more elaborate way for say five colors. And if I use five colors,

279
00:15:08.151 --> 00:15:13.100
this one will turn out to be not five colorable and this one would turn out.

280
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:14.540
It is five colorable.

281
00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:18.200
And so the upshot would be that these two are in fact different.

282
00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:23.270
So by doing three color ability and handing on a further level of study to this,

283
00:15:23.271 --> 00:15:24.320
the five color Bailey,

284
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.730
I would indeed have succeeded at proving that all three of these are different

285
00:15:28.731 --> 00:15:30.110
knots in particular.

286
00:15:30.111 --> 00:15:34.670
There's no way to are not the truffle or the figure eight knot by without

287
00:15:34.671 --> 00:15:38.630
cutting it. And also there's no way to move. As we saw already the three,

288
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:40.490
the trefoil into the figure eight,

289
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:44.180
they can't get from one to the other just by continuous motions.

290
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.720
Quite good for elementary, just coloring around. Don't you think.

291
00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:52.330
<v 3>Just because this one is three colorable and that one's, I mean, that does seem.</v>

292
00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:58.720
<v 1>Tolerable because the point is that after I fill in the steps that I skipped</v>

293
00:15:58.721 --> 00:16:02.800
over, right, or which I took an example of, but didn't do the others of that.

294
00:16:02.801 --> 00:16:05.290
The point is that if a nod is three colorable,

295
00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:10.150
as I do these rider buys the moves and move it around and change the number of

296
00:16:10.151 --> 00:16:10.984
crossings,

297
00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:15.610
the property of three color ability is maintained all the way through.

298
00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:19.750
For example, when I did the pig tail and I put in a pig tail,

299
00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.360
it was compatible. In fact, I adapted the rules.

300
00:16:22.361 --> 00:16:26.050
So as to achieve this property and modified by original guests.

301
00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.370
And so if this is three colorable, as I move it around continuously,

302
00:16:30.371 --> 00:16:32.890
without coloring, without cutting it, though,

303
00:16:32.891 --> 00:16:36.490
I changed the number of crossings and may make it like the Kitty's thing.

304
00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:40.270
Fantastically, more complicated looking before I try to simplify it.

305
00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:43.900
Nevertheless, at the very end three color ability,

306
00:16:43.901 --> 00:16:47.620
if it was three combos at the beginning, it will be three colorable VN.

307
00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:49.810
If it was not three colorable at the beginning,

308
00:16:49.811 --> 00:16:51.640
it will not be three collarbone VN.

309
00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:56.200
And so the fact that the one is recallable and the other is not three colorable

310
00:16:56.201 --> 00:16:59.370
with the given projection means that there's no way to move this

311
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:06.610
And understand culpability better by developing the theory of polynomial and

312
00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:08.110
variance of knots. Specifically,

313
00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.010
there's an old polynomial invariant that goes back about a hundred years,

314
00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:16.210
the polynomial and variant for this not turns out to be Delta vex.

315
00:17:16.211 --> 00:17:21.100
The PA the Alexander polynomial is X squared minus X plus one.
