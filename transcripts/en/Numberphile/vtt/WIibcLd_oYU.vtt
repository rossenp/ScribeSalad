00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.500
<v 0>So we're can talk about domes and we're gonna talk about one of the largest and</v>

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.470
possibly one of the most famous in the world here in the UK. So in London, St.

3
00:00:09.471 --> 00:00:10.370
Paul's cathedral,

4
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.490
it's a very large theater and there's right in the center of London and has this

5
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.640
really imposing dome. One of the biggest in the world,

6
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.910
they amateur is 34 meters. The question becomes,

7
00:00:19.911 --> 00:00:24.770
how do you build the correct shape of dome so that it

8
00:00:24.771 --> 00:00:28.790
will sit under its own weight without supports without mass?

9
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.910
How do you actually create that? And that's a math problem.

10
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.400
So that's what we're going to figure out. Okay, great. Fire of London,

11
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.020
1666 had just happened and suppose was really badly damaged and they wanted to

12
00:00:39.021 --> 00:00:41.750
rebuild this grand cathedral, Christopher Brown,

13
00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:46.160
very famous architect of the time he was given the task of rebuilding this

14
00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:46.581
cathedral.

15
00:00:46.581 --> 00:00:51.560
And he wanted this big dome to kind of be the centerpiece of the cathedral.

16
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.210
And at the time he was really good friends with a famous physicist Robert hook,

17
00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.040
and they kind of worked together to try and think about how can we have the

18
00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:05.030
largest dome possible that doesn't need any support.

19
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.690
And because Robert hook was a physicist and a mathematician,

20
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.850
he thought about this mathematically and his amazing insight

21
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.860
was to actually use, basically use nature to help us figure this out.

22
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.560
So what he did was I think he used a chain,

23
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.190
but it's the same with a piece of string and you just hold your two ends.

24
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.500
Like so, so their level, so my hands were about level,

25
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.420
and then you just let it form its shape.

26
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.610
So this forms a sort of U shape kind of looks like a parabola or an X squared

27
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.930
graph, perhaps. And this is actually sort of, well,

28
00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:40.160
it's nature being lazy,

29
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.840
easiest way to describe it because what's happening here is it's forming the

30
00:01:44.841 --> 00:01:49.400
sheep. That minimize is the energy of the, of the string.

31
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.890
So the potential energy from gravity,

32
00:01:51.891 --> 00:01:56.060
pulling it down is minimized in this shape. So, and if I move my hands,

33
00:01:56.061 --> 00:01:57.500
it will obviously adjust its shape,

34
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.080
still forming this kind of U shape and re Hawk's idea was to say,

35
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:06.560
well, this is forming to minimize the energy.

36
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.670
So if we flip it up, because when it was hanging,

37
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.470
it was minimizing its energy.

38
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.160
And the way it was doing that is by spreading out the weight as much as

39
00:02:16.161 --> 00:02:18.620
possible. So suddenly when you flip it upside down,

40
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.300
you've got your dome where your weight is spread out as much as possible.

41
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.480
And so that is going to help you to build the biggest possible dome.

42
00:02:26.481 --> 00:02:30.740
You can basically using nature as like a guide or a blueprint of how to do this.

43
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.660
And this is basically, this is what they did. So,

44
00:02:32.661 --> 00:02:37.280
so if you actually look at the original plans for St Paul's or even the drawings

45
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.990
of the, of the building itself, it actually uses this idea and the shape.

46
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.940
So the outer dome, it was a very big hemisphere. This is 34 meters in diameter,

47
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.470
right across the bottom here.

48
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.120
And then this kind of then comes down a bit down here is the inner dome,

49
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.250
which is also a Hemisfair like this,

50
00:02:55.251 --> 00:02:57.920
and this one's a little bit smaller that doesn't quite go to the edge.

51
00:02:57.921 --> 00:03:01.930
The inside one is 30 meters. So when you're inside some Pauls,

52
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.470
you can look up and you can see all the beautiful artwork on the ceiling.

53
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.190
That's the inner dome, not the outer one that you can see from outside.

54
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:12.070
They're two separate domes. And the inner one is a little bit smaller,

55
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.880
three meters, less across the sphere and sort of the perfection of it.

56
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.620
And the cemetery has symbolic meaning.

57
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.190
So that was why these had to be spherical. This is kind of what Ren was told,

58
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.500
but of course he wanted to, to make it strong, make it, uh, you know,

59
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.510
use maths to help us build this thing.

60
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.520
So what they did was on the inside bit in here

61
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.170
was actually create a third dome.

62
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.240
And this is the shape of the hanging chain or the shape of my piece of string.

63
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.440
So this thing in here is actually what's bearing all of the load.

64
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.610
So you have these kinds of spiritual shells on the outside,

65
00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:53.530
and all of the weight is actually supported by the hanging string or the hanging

66
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:56.830
chain sheet in the middle. That's doing the business. Yeah.

67
00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.620
That's the one that's actually supporting.

68
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.450
<v 1>The dome. So the staff at and all that.</v>

69
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.560
<v 0>Yeah. I'm not sure he's quite this pointy, but it's definitely not.</v>

70
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.140
It's definitely not a hemisphere. As we saw when I was hanging it,

71
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:10.600
it wasn't a sphere. It was very much more like a U shape.

72
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.400
So this is supporting all of the weight. Now they figured this out.

73
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.430
So this was the idea like literally hooked to these experiments was like,

74
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.440
this is the shape we need to build. Now, the only problem they had was this,

75
00:04:22.441 --> 00:04:25.330
this was the 60, 60 or 60 seventies.

76
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.280
And to actually know the shape, this hanging chain shape,

77
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.850
you need a, an area of math school, calculus variations,

78
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.260
and that was not discovered or invented until the 1750s,

79
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.870
a hundred years later with these new techniques,

80
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.990
this calculus of variations as it was called,

81
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.870
which has actually worked on mainly by oil and the grunge.

82
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.270
So two very big name of petitions of 17 hundreds.

83
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.760
So with calculus of variations,

84
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.910
you can show the exact shape that this needs to be.

85
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.920
And it's something called a [inaudible]

86
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.920
. This is the exact shape of our hanging string. But the dome itself in St

87
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.920
 Paul's is like a very good approximation of bit

88
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.920
, but that's nothing against hook and ran. They

89
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.753
 just didn't yet have the mathematical tools. They needed to get the exact shape. So they were basing it almost on like an approximation and experiment.

90
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.360
<v 1>So they literally kind of like traced.</v>

91
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.870
<v 0>More or less. Yeah. And it's really interesting.</v>

92
00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:22.630
You can actually look at the original drawings and you can see that they are

93
00:05:22.631 --> 00:05:25.720
literally just like kind of sketching what the shapes should be based on the

94
00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:26.460
shape of a huggy.

95
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.680
J so even though they didn't have the right mathematical tools,

96
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.250
they had the insight to actually put them to work. And it obviously works.

97
00:05:33.251 --> 00:05:36.160
The dome is still there today. So now that we do have the tools,

98
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.860
the shape itself is something called a CAUTI curve or a hyperbolic

99
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.720
co-sign. So with the full tools of carcass, the variations you can show,

100
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:50.560
you can set this problem up hanging chain. I want to minimize energy.

101
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.060
And your answer is this cost curve. So then what we want to know is, well,

102
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.610
what on earth is a cost curve? And that's what I'm gonna need. More paper.

103
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.250
<v 2>Costs.</v>

104
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.850
<v 0>Of X. So this is the actual shape we want for the,</v>

105
00:06:06.851 --> 00:06:08.800
for the [inaudible] for the perfect dome shape.

106
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.350
The cash function is an exponential function.

107
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.360
So the starting point actually here to figure out what's going on with cosh is

108
00:06:16.361 --> 00:06:18.820
to consider the function E to the ax.

109
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.090
So ear to the X is a function which has an expansion,

110
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.290
which is one plus X plus X squared divided by two

111
00:06:26.291 --> 00:06:31.180
factorial, plus X cubed, over three factorial plus.dot dot.

112
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.190
And the graph of this function goes through one like, so that's zero.

113
00:06:36.191 --> 00:06:39.970
And then it decreases never quite gets to zero. And then this bit increases.

114
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.960
So this would be Y equals each of the X. So as you can see, as X gets bigger,

115
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.390
you're just adding together lots and lots of powers of X.

116
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.940
So the thing's going to grow really quickly. This is exponential growth.

117
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.240
Now the cost term is very similar to the exponential,

118
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.230
but what you say is I just want the even terms

119
00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.420
in this song. So I want X to the zero, which is one.

120
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.870
I want X squared. I want X to the four. I want X to the sex.

121
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.260
I'm just going to take me even powers of X and let's see what happens.

122
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.780
And that's basically how you define cosh.

123
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.630
It's the even terms of your exponential.

124
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.430
So you would write then cosh of X is

125
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.550
one plus X squared,

126
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.930
because of course two is even plus X to the four, because four is even,

127
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.880
and we carry on in that way. You can also think about reflecting its graph.

128
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.730
So when you have an even function, well, that means there's,

129
00:07:33.731 --> 00:07:36.280
it's the same either side of the y-axis.

130
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.250
So if we kind of take this bit of the graph, reflect it,

131
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:40.840
this is basically the Costco,

132
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.230
which is the nice dome shape and the nice hanging string sheet that we had.

133
00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:48.370
It would be Y equals cost of X. Now cosh comes from the even terms,

134
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.710
maybe you're thinking, well, what about the odd terms?

135
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.080
And obviously we have a function for that. Uh,

136
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:57.280
so if we do the odd terms and that is going to be showing of X,

137
00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.250
just like this is hyperbolic cause hyperbolic sign,

138
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.250
and this one is going to then be X cause that's,

139
00:08:03.251 --> 00:08:06.820
what's the power one X cubed plus X to the five.

140
00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:10.630
So it's just all your odd powers and shine of X. It's the same up here.

141
00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:14.740
This one goes through zero. So it's a bit more like an X cubed graph.

142
00:08:14.741 --> 00:08:17.260
It's got that kind of kink, almost like Ash shape to it.

143
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.510
And this one can be negative because you've got,

144
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.120
if you still be negative values of X,

145
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.280
you're gonna get minuses from the old powers.

146
00:08:24.281 --> 00:08:28.930
Whereas negative IDs of X appear give you positives. So Kosh stays positive,

147
00:08:28.931 --> 00:08:33.280
but shine can go negative. So we have these two functions, uh,

148
00:08:33.281 --> 00:08:37.510
and then there's actually a shorthand way that you can write a CAUTI as well,

149
00:08:37.511 --> 00:08:41.920
using the exponential formula as you consider ear to the minus X.

150
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.990
So you just take your ear to the X formula,

151
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.530
but wherever there's an ax you plug into minus X. So plus ax,

152
00:08:47.531 --> 00:08:52.000
that becomes a minus X squared. So minus one squared is just one.

153
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:54.910
So I still get plus X squared over two,

154
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.940
then I'll get minus execute over three factorial or carry on.

155
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.420
So the terms, the sign alternates, when you plug in minus X.

156
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.050
So now if you take each to the minus X and each of the X,

157
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:11.760
if we add them together, so we do eat to the X plus E to the minus X,

158
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.190
you can add them together and I'm going to divide by two because I'm going to

159
00:09:14.191 --> 00:09:16.830
get one plus one. Then when I divide by two, this moving one,

160
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:21.810
I've got plus X and minus X, they disappear. I then got two,

161
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:24.420
lots of the X squared term, five divided by two.

162
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.450
So I just get plus X squared to material.

163
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:31.740
The cubic one has gotten negative here. It's got a positive, they disappear.

164
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:36.180
So there'll be no cubic term X to the fourth. And then we carry on.

165
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.730
And of course this is quarterbacks.

166
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:44.550
Even the even terms exactly as we defined it here, but now you can rate it.

167
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.170
And it's really nice shorthand formula.

168
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.650
It's just easily expertly to the minus X divided by two.

169
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.780
<v 1>What's the variable here. If I want to go home and build a dome on my house,</v>

170
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.220
what's the, you know, which is not as wide as St. Paul's cathedral.

171
00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.760
What's the thing I need to change, like to get my graph. So.

172
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.760
<v 0>If you are to draw the graph of costs,</v>

173
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:07.880
so depending on how wide you want your dome,

174
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:11.210
this is going to tell you that the shape. So if your Dome's really narrow,

175
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.620
let's call it five meters.

176
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.210
Then you would go up here and you're going to get a very kind of wide flat dome

177
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.420
in that instance. Whereas if you're going to like some poles, which let's say,

178
00:10:20.421 --> 00:10:24.200
maybe that's all the way out to here, that distance is your 34 meters,

179
00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.530
then you're getting this kind of bigger shape.

180
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.570
So all of them follow the same graph.

181
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.480
So the other thing that will change is the length of the string.

182
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:33.620
And this is actually,

183
00:10:33.621 --> 00:10:38.540
this comes up in the full calculus of variations way of solving

184
00:10:38.541 --> 00:10:43.040
the problem you do have to input my string is of this fixed length.

185
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.970
So, so the solution does depend on the length of your string.

186
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:51.500
So if I have my fixed length of string here, then I form this particular shape.

187
00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.840
But then if I say, right, well, I'm only going to have this bit of string,

188
00:10:53.841 --> 00:10:56.330
and there's still that far apart. I've got, I'm a shallower dome now,

189
00:10:56.390 --> 00:11:01.010
but no matter what length of string you have and how far apart my hands are,

190
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:06.260
all of these shapes that are being formed are Kosh curbs.

191
00:11:06.261 --> 00:11:11.030
They are all hyperbolic co-sign curbs. You've just got a variable in that,

192
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.330
which is representing the fact that the length or the distance is changing.

193
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:18.380
<v 1>So no matter what droop I'm seeing there in the string. Yeah, it is,</v>

194
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.350
it is some variation of that same curve on scene.

195
00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:24.800
<v 0>Well, a hyperbolic cost code. Yes. In all of these situations,</v>

196
00:11:24.801 --> 00:11:25.850
the answer is yes.

197
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.490
<v 1>The Costco. I'm just sort of seeing it at different zooms.</v>

198
00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:29.630
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

199
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:33.770
So either at different zooms or you can cause if I put them really close

200
00:11:33.771 --> 00:11:36.710
together, now it's a very different shape, but that is still a cost curve.

201
00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:40.520
You could still write down the actual formula. So, so the,

202
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:44.840
the F the full formula will be cautious of

203
00:11:44.841 --> 00:11:48.860
something where that something depends on the length of your string.

204
00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:50.480
Depends on how far apart you are.

205
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.880
So there are variables that you have to input to get the exact answer,

206
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:59.260
but everything that comes out is this hyperbolic coastline function ran and

207
00:11:59.261 --> 00:12:02.890
hook. Didn't like Kosh didn't exist until the 1760s.

208
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:04.690
So it wasn't even a function.

209
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:07.660
So they literally had no chance of knowing that this was the shape they needed

210
00:12:07.661 --> 00:12:11.050
to build this dope. So they just had to take like best guesses.

211
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.420
And they kind of did this through almost knowing what it wasn't.

212
00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.230
So do their experiments with the hanging chains and the string.

213
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.990
They knew it wasn't an X squared.

214
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:27.940
So they were definitely sure it wasn't the parabola. So then they kind of tried,

215
00:12:27.941 --> 00:12:32.500
well, what's the next simplest thing I could have. Maybe it's a cubic.

216
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:37.150
Maybe it's a Y equals X cubed. So if we were to plot Y equals X cubed,

217
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:38.680
and we're just going to add one to it,

218
00:12:38.681 --> 00:12:40.540
so that it goes through one instead of zero,

219
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:44.380
just because cosh also goes through one, if we were to draw away cause X cubed,

220
00:12:44.381 --> 00:12:46.450
plus one, it would look like that hair.

221
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.850
And then it would kind of go down like this,

222
00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.280
what ran and hooked did was they reflected it.

223
00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.200
So then we kind of extend it this way.

224
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:57.850
So it is believed that the actual shape of this inner

225
00:12:57.851 --> 00:13:01.780
dome at St Paul's is an X cubed curve.

226
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.500
That is what we, what we believe at the moment. They actually based this on.

227
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.670
And it's a really good approximation to the Costco cash curve.

228
00:13:09.671 --> 00:13:13.840
On top of this, it basically looks kind of the same,

229
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:17.020
very similar at the start it does eventually come through.

230
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:21.700
And then what happens at really large values of X is because the cash is an

231
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:26.710
exponential function. Exponential functions will always beat to polynomials.

232
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.950
This is why exponential growth is such an issue in such a thing,

233
00:13:29.951 --> 00:13:33.160
because exponential is, will eventually grow faster than a polynomial.

234
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:35.230
So it will eventually beat the execute.

235
00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.170
So even though it sort of starts inside and then comes outside,

236
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.300
eventually it comes back up,

237
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.920
up here and becomes narrower because it grows faster. So the, the idea,

238
00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:49.270
the thing that clearly, um, ran and hook spotted was that,

239
00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.051
you know,

240
00:13:50.051 --> 00:13:53.830
they're drawing the red curve is based on their experiments with the string and

241
00:13:53.831 --> 00:13:54.790
the hanging chains.

242
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:59.530
And they clearly spotted that the ax cube does a really good job of capturing

243
00:13:59.531 --> 00:14:00.130
that.

244
00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:03.820
And so we believe that that is actually what they used to build that in a dome

245
00:14:03.821 --> 00:14:05.740
at St. Paul's that's taking all of the weight,

246
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:08.080
allowing such a big dome to do actually exist.

247
00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:15.030
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

248
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:19.470
<v 4>This episode has been supported by Kiwi co and today I'm making an</v>

249
00:14:19.471 --> 00:14:22.560
infinity mirror from their tinker crate,

250
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.490
keep co delivers all sorts of crates with different themes,

251
00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:27.960
different target ages,

252
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:33.030
just take a pick from their website and find one on your doorstep. Every month.

253
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.190
It's like Christmas, all year round.

254
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.430
Everything you're gonna need is already in the box.

255
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:43.410
Even the batteries are included when necessary. These are great for kids,

256
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.010
including slightly bigger and older kids like me.

257
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.320
It's a real learning experience.

258
00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.820
Sometimes I didn't even realize how clever this was until after I'd made.

259
00:14:52.821 --> 00:14:56.720
The thing gave me a bit of an insight into how things get made. Actually,

260
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:03.020
the address is there on the screen, Kiwi code.com/number file.

261
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:07.580
That's going to get you 50% of your first month on any crepe,

262
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:11.240
Kiwi code.com with that slash number far,

263
00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.490
and take a look at that. Lover, a Kiwi code subscription,

264
00:15:16.491 --> 00:15:18.470
make a great Christmas or birthday present.
