00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.020
<v 0>I've got a new favorite constant to tell you about comes constant.</v>

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.740
You live a number. So, um, let me write it out.

3
00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:11.990
Here is my new favorite constant 2.92

4
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.140
(005)

5
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.260
097-7316, going on forever.

6
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.250
That's my new favorite constant because kind of magically,

7
00:00:25.251 --> 00:00:27.710
this is going to create prime numbers for us.

8
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.390
We're gonna use this constant and this formula going to create a sequence

9
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.800
of numbers.

10
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.390
And the next number in your sequence will be taking the

11
00:00:38.391 --> 00:00:43.280
previous number in your sequence. We're gonna round it down.

12
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.890
And that's what that symbol means. It's called the floor function.

13
00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:48.140
You round it down to the nearest integer,

14
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.880
and then we'll multiply that by taking the previous number in the

15
00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:56.990
sequence, subtracting the internship part.

16
00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.220
So I guess it's the decimal part. What ad wanted that?

17
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.810
And this is going to give us a sequence of prime numbers,

18
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.570
especially when we are going to round them down as well.

19
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.880
We're going to use that floor function. I'm going to prove it.

20
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.670
We'll start with the constant.

21
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.670
So that's gonna be the first number in our sequence.

22
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.660
Let's start with one first number. My sequence is this thing,

23
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.850
2.9200 and the rest. Um, and by the way,

24
00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:28.730
I will point out that if I round this down,

25
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.940
it's the first prime it's two. Great.

26
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.290
Let's try the next number in my sequence. I've got my formula here. Just saying,

27
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.870
take the previous number,

28
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.890
round it down to it means to take the decimal part and add one.

29
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.600
So it can be multiplying by this

30
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.420
1.9200 and the rest that is going to give me the next number. It's

31
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.790
3.8401. I well, nine and stuff, but out.

32
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.360
So then next prime number we were after it's three. Okay.

33
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.710
So we're hoping this is going to work as well, three and then yeah,

34
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.660
one plus the decimal part 1.8, four zero on stuff.

35
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.290
What's it going?

36
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.240
B is going to be five that's good news and some junk at the end of

37
00:02:14.241 --> 00:02:17.690
it. Pretty important. Junk is going to be important junk.

38
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.890
That's why I'm writing it out. We need this junk and so well,

39
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.003
let's see if it keeps going.

40
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.920
We're hoping for a seven so we can take the internship part, which was five.

41
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.480
We take the decimal part with a one point and then the rest five,

42
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.450
two zero three zero five, eight,

43
00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:38.090
six is equal to what's it going to be

44
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.620
7.601 by two nine and a small junk. One more. Are you,

45
00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:49.730
how are you satisfied? Do you believe me? Oh, let's do it. Okay.

46
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.140
So what do we want the next one to be? So we've got three, five, seven,

47
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.980
11. It should be 11. Okay. So we take our previous one,

48
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.170
which is a seven one plus junk. And if you do your calculation,

49
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.190
yes,

50
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.870
11.210705 and

51
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:11.530
stuff, and this constant never fails, and this has never fading.

52
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:15.850
So there is this constant somewhere out there in the world of

53
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:18.460
numbers with this formula,

54
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.680
which will give you every prime number in order as well, not missing one,

55
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.750
every prime number two, three, five, seven, 11, 13, and forever.

56
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.610
And this constant great was found by

57
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.700
a viewer number five viewer, uh,

58
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.630
who was inspired by one of my previous number five videos.

59
00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:44.380
I have talked about constants that generate prime numbers before.

60
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.690
And I did a video about something called mills constant. So mills constant,

61
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.500
uh, was a constant and a formula in the same kind of way,

62
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.200
which was this I'm going to call it a,

63
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.040
and it was 1.3

64
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.280
(637)

65
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.820
788-3863 and stuff. So this was males constant. And the,

66
00:04:08.821 --> 00:04:11.850
and the formula was kind of like, this is rounding down.

67
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.570
It was males constant to the power,

68
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.960
three to power N and then you would run that down.

69
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.380
It gave you a sequences of primes. Uh, I'll show you what they are.

70
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.820
So the first prime you got for doing this was a tooth.

71
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.890
Then the next one was 11.

72
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.910
Then the next one was 1,361.

73
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.180
And the next one was, Oh, it was a big number.

74
00:04:36.181 --> 00:04:40.560
It was 2 billion, 521 million,

75
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.370
8,887.

76
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.250
And then the little was huge, really, really big. And,

77
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.330
and so it's generating a sequence of primes. Although there are gaps,

78
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.670
there are gaps in this sequence and they get really big as well. So, um,

79
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.240
one of our viewers saw that video. Uh, so that's, uh,

80
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.530
Judy Grabowski and he was at high school at the time.

81
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.870
And he wasn't impressed because, Oh yeah, well it generates primes,

82
00:05:12.871 --> 00:05:17.130
but big gaps, huge primes. He wondered,

83
00:05:17.131 --> 00:05:20.400
could he make a constant? So you could get all the primes,

84
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.560
Bomba bunk in order as well.

85
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.030
So he came up with this idea and he started calculating this

86
00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:31.740
constant with, uh, some of his friends. Uh, so it's Bruno,

87
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.150
uh, Dylan Massey and they created this.

88
00:05:36.151 --> 00:05:39.360
I've never seen this before. I love it. However,

89
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.180
I can tell you now it's not predictive.

90
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.950
This is not going to be able to tell me primes. I don't already know.

91
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.200
I'm afraid. Mill's constant is the same.

92
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.450
We actually using the primes to create this constantly exists

93
00:05:54.451 --> 00:05:58.690
somewhere out there. I'm afraid. I just don't know what it is. Uh,

94
00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:03.680
and I'm sure, um, creating prime Constance doesn't have to be that hard.

95
00:06:03.681 --> 00:06:04.514
You can just have

96
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.890
0.23571113.

97
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.480
That's a prime generating. Constant. Not very interesting. One. Those,

98
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:16.790
it's not very fun. It's not very surprising.

99
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.760
I think this is kind of fun and surprising,

100
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.520
and it does use properties of primes. They thing,

101
00:06:22.521 --> 00:06:27.160
the primes here using particular properties or primes.

102
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.003
I want to show you what the.

103
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.380
<v 1>So it's more a case that the primes are generating the constant rather than the</v>

104
00:06:32.381 --> 00:06:33.850
constant generating the prime. Right?

105
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.860
<v 0>You've caught me out. Yes. It's the primes generating the constant. I mean,</v>

106
00:06:38.861 --> 00:06:42.220
it exists somewhere out there. It'd be lovely.

107
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.690
We could calculate it and then we could use it to predict primes.

108
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.100
I'm afraid. That's not the way it works.

109
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.280
<v 1>So the number of decimal places, we know this constant too.</v>

110
00:06:51.281 --> 00:06:52.930
Depends on the number of primes we know.

111
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.750
<v 0>Exactly. Yeah. I'm afraid we are limited by how many primes we know. Uh, but I,</v>

112
00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:01.670
I do like it. I do think it's kind of fun and surprising.

113
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.500
Cause there's a cute little.

114
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.120
<v 1>Constant. Have I given it a name?</v>

115
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.600
<v 0>I don't think they've given it a name. I think I know,</v>

116
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.350
I knew you were going to give it a name. Upgrading loves giving thing. Yeah.

117
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:16.450
<v 1>I'd say a day, but I did. They have the right to name it. They do. Yeah.</v>

118
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.280
But you know, if they don't hurry up,

119
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.430
I might jump on the bandwagon and he's going to do it fast.

120
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.070
So we'll see the time.

121
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.970
<v 0>Until of this video. What is the, what is Brady decided? Uh,</v>

122
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.910
so let's see how they made it. So when I saw this,

123
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:35.420
I actually really enjoyed reverse engineering, how they did it, but, uh,

124
00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:36.790
and you might try that yourself,

125
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.690
but I might give you the ingredients that you need.

126
00:07:40.691 --> 00:07:44.290
And then you can see perhaps for yourself how they did it. First of all,

127
00:07:44.291 --> 00:07:48.160
I'm going to tell you what a general term in the sequence looks like. Uh,

128
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.870
we were calling those F N I'm going to show you how to write FN in terms of

129
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:57.100
prying numbers. It actually looks like this. It's the nth prime,

130
00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.020
and then we're going to subtract one.

131
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:05.170
And then the next term we're going to add on is the

132
00:08:05.171 --> 00:08:06.280
next prime number.

133
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:10.210
So it's the end plus one prime subtract one

134
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:14.890
and divide that by the nth prime.

135
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:19.000
And then for the next term, you take the next prime number,

136
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:24.400
which is prime number with the N plus two subscript there

137
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:26.530
we're subtract one again.

138
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:31.750
And we're going to divide by the previous primes P and plus

139
00:08:31.751 --> 00:08:35.230
one P N multiply. Yeah.

140
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.770
So we're divided by this, multiply by that. Yes, exactly.

141
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.260
And so you can see what the next term might be.

142
00:08:41.261 --> 00:08:46.240
So the next one is going to be the next prime number still with subtract one

143
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.740
and then dividing by the previous primes we've got, so these prime numbers,

144
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.960
and that's the pattern that goes on forever.

145
00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.030
So if you want to work out the first one,

146
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.940
which is our special constant F1, uh,

147
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.110
we'll start with the first prime.

148
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.250
So that would be a two minus one plus,

149
00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:09.240
and then you take the next prime three minus one now divided by two,

150
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:15.480
and then it's going to be the next prime up five minus one divided by

151
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:19.290
our previous primes.

152
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.090
And then next prime up

153
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.530
divided by our previous primes.

154
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:29.520
And that's going to be our constant that I told you at the beginning 2.9,

155
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.400
whatever. So those are starting ingredients.

156
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:36.120
And then this really important observation,

157
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.620
we're going to use a property of primes called Bertrand's postulate is a big

158
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:45.120
thing. Actually, when you're studying primes, if you've got the nth prime,

159
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.450
the next prime is obviously bigger,

160
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:54.210
but it is smaller than twice the nth

161
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.550
prime. I'm not going to do the proof for you.

162
00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:01.140
It's totally possible to do for yourself. When I heard about this constant,

163
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:03.750
I thought it was great. I loved it. I thought it was good, fun.

164
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.090
I went looking to see if anyone had done it before,

165
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.250
and I've not seen anyone do it before,

166
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:13.680
but I did find it in one place in a kind of completely

167
00:10:13.681 --> 00:10:18.270
different context. I found it somewhere, which is with this sequence,

168
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:19.530
something slightly different.

169
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.940
We're going to look for the smallest prime that doesn't

170
00:10:23.941 --> 00:10:28.770
divide N that doesn't divide any sort of factor of N so it's

171
00:10:28.771 --> 00:10:33.600
not a factor of N so for one, the smallest prime, it doesn't divide.

172
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:38.460
One is two smallest point that doesn't divide. Two is three.

173
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:42.810
The smallest prime that doesn't divide three is two smallest prime doesn't

174
00:10:42.811 --> 00:10:46.560
divide. Four is three smallest prime.

175
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:51.210
It doesn't divide five to smallest pine that doesn't divide six. Can't be two,

176
00:10:51.211 --> 00:10:53.580
can't be three. That one's a five.

177
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:58.770
And then it's a two here and three here and so on. So that's a sequence,

178
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:03.720
smallest primes that don't divide N and if you look at the average of this

179
00:11:03.721 --> 00:11:06.450
sequence, and this is going on forever,

180
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.580
but if you took the average of this sequence,

181
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.150
it is my new favorite constant it's.

182
00:11:12.151 --> 00:11:15.900
The prime generator is the prime generator, a completely different sequence.

183
00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:20.820
This is going on forever. So we're looking at what the average tends to, uh,

184
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.260
to work out. The average,

185
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.520
you look at the proportion of these numbers

186
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:31.200
that are two. And so, and half of them are half of this.

187
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.240
Half of these numbers are two.

188
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.350
Then you would look at the proportion of these numbers that are three.

189
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.520
And if you look there, you can work out the proportion of threes.

190
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:45.000
You look at the proportions of fives and using those numbers,

191
00:11:45.001 --> 00:11:48.810
you can add them up. You can find the average of the sequence.
