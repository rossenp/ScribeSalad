00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.620
<v 0>Cat problems. Pet problems is a genre.</v>

2
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.280
Many people like to use it to frame various common tutorial problems.

3
00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:12.000
If you go far enough with these, you end up with error correcting codes.

4
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:14.130
Of course your smartphone depends on those.

5
00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:18.660
But today I'm just going to show you several hat problems. The two hat problem,

6
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.490
uh, involves two people.

7
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.260
Each of whom is going to have a blue or a red hat placed on their

8
00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:28.200
head by an impartial referee.

9
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.090
Who's going to flip a coin to determine whether I'm going to have a blue hat or

10
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.990
a oops.

11
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.063
<v 1>A red hat.</v>

12
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.280
<v 2>So you're wearing a blue or red and I'm playing to I that's right.</v>

13
00:00:40.281 --> 00:00:43.250
You have a bluer red on my head. I can't see it.

14
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.343
<v 1>Here.</v>

15
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.540
<v 0>You might imagine me doing that and looking up like that.</v>

16
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.260
And that's not allowed. In fact, if this are being played for money,

17
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.010
we would each be locked in a jail cell with a TV screen.

18
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.870
And the only thing we would see is our names. And under your name,

19
00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:15.770
I would see a hat and under my name, I would see a choice.

20
00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:19.010
I can predict my hair color. I can say either blue or red.

21
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.840
Let me talk you through a game. Okay?

22
00:01:20.841 --> 00:01:24.080
So the hats have been placed on our head by a referee.

23
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.530
And now I see your hat and I'm supposed to, first of all,

24
00:01:27.531 --> 00:01:31.760
predict my hat color on a signal. It's simultaneous with your prediction.

25
00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:35.840
We each make a prediction of our hat color. I haven't seen mine,

26
00:01:35.841 --> 00:01:40.580
which means my prediction is 50 50. Your prediction is 50 50.

27
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.460
<v 2>Because both of our hats were randomly chosen.</v>

28
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.320
And the choice isn't connected in any way.

29
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.770
<v 0>The choice is not connected. The referee flipped the coin for each one.</v>

30
00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:52.970
There are four possible ways. The hats could be there. Two reds, blue, red, red,

31
00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:56.150
blue, and two blues. We make a prediction,

32
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.490
but the goal is a little unusual.

33
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.530
The goal is that exactly. One of us is right there when we succeed,

34
00:02:03.531 --> 00:02:06.470
if you're right and I'm wrong, or vice versa, we fail.

35
00:02:06.471 --> 00:02:07.880
If we're both wrong or both, right?

36
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.160
<v 2>So one of us has to be right.</v>

37
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.820
One of us has to be wrong about the color on our own head.

38
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.920
<v 0>This looks awfully challenging.</v>

39
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.160
I guess about my head color is just a guess.

40
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.920
It has 50% chance of success.

41
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.950
Your guest's has 50% chance of success.

42
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.200
And the goal is not only to try to

43
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.880
be one right, one wrong, but to get that all the time,

44
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.540
somehow combining these 50 fifties and coming up with certainty,

45
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.860
certainly sounds impossible. At first glance, once you see the idea,

46
00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:46.850
you'll see that your mental image of that was not right.

47
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:47.723
<v 1>Right.</v>

48
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.350
<v 0>Okay. Here's the winning strategy.</v>

49
00:02:57.351 --> 00:03:01.660
The night before we that on the following,

50
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.700
you will be agreeable and you will say whatever color you

51
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:08.260
see, and I.

52
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.480
<v 2>Will say red, you're wearing, I'm wearing red.</v>

53
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.960
<v 0>So you're going to say red. And on the other hand,</v>

54
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:15.670
I'm going to be disagreeable.

55
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.830
And I will say the opposite of what I see and you're wearing blue.

56
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.210
So I'm going to say red Berg, both going to save red in that circumstance,

57
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.650
you can make a table and figure out why there's always going to be one of us.

58
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:32.920
Correct. But if you think about it, there's a very intuitive reason.

59
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.230
I'm betting that that colors are opposite and you being

60
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:41.890
much more agreeable are betting that the colors are the same.

61
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.180
And so therefore, clearly one of us is right. And one of us is wrong.

62
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.510
<v 2>What if the grooves of the game had been that we both have to be right?</v>

63
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.040
Could we have had a winning strategy? Then.

64
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.180
<v 0>If we both have to be right, there is just no way we can do it.</v>

65
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.490
And so there's something about this particular set of rules that enables this

66
00:04:02.491 --> 00:04:04.560
magic trick, three hats.

67
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.250
There's a famous three hat problem that arose about 20 years ago.

68
00:04:08.251 --> 00:04:12.150
I got a lot of press. And let me describe that one to you.

69
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.230
There are now three players, Alice, Bob, and Charlie,

70
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.380
and the rules are still,

71
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.620
we're going to have hats place randomly on our heads.

72
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.330
We are not allowed to communicate. Once that's done at a bell,

73
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.300
say 10 seconds. After the hats are replaced,

74
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.650
the three possible answers are red, blue, and pass.

75
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.250
And those are predictions for my hat color.

76
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.260
And of course the rules include the fact that everybody sees to add colors,

77
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.380
but not their own. And maybe I should have this off.

78
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.570
<v 2>I like it. But anyway, it's up to you. What's the idea to win the game here.</v>

79
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.730
<v 0>So here, uh,</v>

80
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.950
each of the three of us makes a prediction or passes and

81
00:04:58.951 --> 00:05:00.000
we win.

82
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.520
If there are no incorrect predictions and

83
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.290
at least somebody makes a prediction or we lose.

84
00:05:10.291 --> 00:05:12.990
If anybody says something wrong,

85
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.030
or if everybody passes have to scratch your head a little about that,

86
00:05:18.031 --> 00:05:20.850
but it's actually a fairly natural.

87
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.670
<v 2>So at least one person has to make a guess.</v>

88
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.040
And everyone who makes a guess must be.

89
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.250
<v 0>That's right? So if we do that,</v>

90
00:05:29.251 --> 00:05:34.230
we're all freed from jail or get a million dollars. Pick your favorite reward.

91
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.840
<v 2>It depends on your current circumstance.</v>

92
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.790
<v 0>You might start thinking of some strategies, one that you might take,</v>

93
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.840
if you didn't have a strategy session, was everybody guesses. Okay.

94
00:05:45.841 --> 00:05:47.970
Let's think about that. Alice,

95
00:05:47.971 --> 00:05:52.230
Bob and Charlie each make a guess by the rules. Namely,

96
00:05:52.231 --> 00:05:54.630
each hat is randomly chosen.

97
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.790
Each of those has probability of one half of being, right?

98
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.350
So the chance that we would win with that strategy is one out of eight.

99
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.050
If you think about it a little bit, it would be better.

100
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:08.180
If just one person say Alice guest,

101
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.740
one reasonable strategy is Bob and Charlie pass Alice guesses.

102
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.970
Now that comes down to a coin flip Alice's betting on her hat color.

103
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.050
So she has one and two or a 50% chance of being right.

104
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.150
<v 2>Okay. Well, that's a key strategy.</v>

105
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.190
<v 0>It may seem that nothing better can be done. Why is that?</v>

106
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:33.320
Because anybody who doesn't pass and somebody has to not pass is

107
00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:35.000
making a 50, 50 guests.

108
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.470
So that almost seems like it's a proof that you can't do any better.

109
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.270
<v 2>There's no connection between the hats. There's no quantum entanglement here,</v>

110
00:06:43.271 --> 00:06:46.480
like, like the hats are all completely independent, random.

111
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.410
<v 0>The hats are all placed by a coin flip.</v>

112
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.280
So how could anything, uh, improve one half,

113
00:06:54.281 --> 00:06:57.220
improve the profitability of one person guessing

114
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.350
There is an amazing strategy. The first time you see it,

115
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.590
that gives you a chance, three out of four of winning.

116
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:11.260
And that's 75% and you can't do any better than that.

117
00:07:11.261 --> 00:07:16.180
So you're not always going to win this game. It's not like the two person game,

118
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:20.890
but three quarters seems pretty amazing, but let's start with the strategy.

119
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.950
Then I'm going to do of all things, drug cube,

120
00:07:23.951 --> 00:07:26.800
and walk you through how you could have come up with that strategy.

121
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.790
Here's the strategy, your two friends, you don't know your head color.

122
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.880
If you see two hats of the same color,

123
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.100
you say the opposite may seem a little odd.

124
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.040
<v 2>That's what you say. So if you see two blues, you say I've got.</v>

125
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.520
<v 0>That's right. If you see two hats of opposite color,</v>

126
00:07:42.521 --> 00:07:44.770
one blue and one red you pass,

127
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.790
I actually want to work you through how you might come up with this answer.

128
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:53.140
Really? There are two cases. Let's think about what happens.

129
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.670
If all three hats are the same color. If all three hats have the same color.

130
00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.150
For instance, everybody like me has a red hat on.

131
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.380
According to this strategy, we all say blue.

132
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.870
The only other case is two ads of one color.

133
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.270
And the third hat of the other color,

134
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:14.110
let's think about what happens in that case. Alice, Bob,

135
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:18.250
and Charles have these color hats. What is going to happen?

136
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:22.210
Both Alice and Bob each see one hat at each color.

137
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:24.700
So they're going to pass. What about Charles?

138
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:29.470
Charles sees two hats of that color and he announces the opposite

139
00:08:29.471 --> 00:08:31.960
color red. So now that's a win.

140
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:36.880
Now we have to ask the following interesting question. First of all,

141
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.730
how many ways are there to place the hats?

142
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.080
There's two choices for each of the three players. Two times,

143
00:08:44.081 --> 00:08:48.970
two times two means there's eight ways to place those hats.

144
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.740
How many are there and where the hats are all the same color to all blue,

145
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.400
all red. Those are cases where you're going to fail.

146
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.610
You have a one quarter chance of failing.

147
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.840
The other six cases are all the two and one. And in that case, you succeed.

148
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.940
So your winning strategy is to do this and you win

149
00:09:08.941 --> 00:09:10.040
with probability three.

150
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.960
<v 2>Easy peasy, easy peasy. I don't know what you're talking about. Cubes and stuff,</v>

151
00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:18.340
or this is like, this is just, this is sorted. Yeah, it's cute. So.

152
00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.070
<v 0>As far,</v>

153
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:23.270
what I want to try to do is give you a feeling about how to think about it and

154
00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:27.440
how you might come up with it. Brady and SIS, I draw pictures.

155
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:32.570
So I'm going to draw a picture of a cube. Um, here's a cube now of course,

156
00:09:32.571 --> 00:09:37.040
your immediate reaction is what does this have to do with anything? Well,

157
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:41.570
we agreed. There are eight possible hat, placements being a mathematician.

158
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.840
It's very hard for me to keep track of colors like blue and red.

159
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.450
All I can keep track of zeros and ones.

160
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:52.430
So I'm going to label these with all possible triples of

161
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.160
zeros in ones. Okay.

162
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:59.780
And they're labeling the vertices of the cube and, and, uh,

163
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.140
Brady's being kind to not pointing out that I didn't label this one.

164
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:09.080
And if you look at it carefully, you'll see that any adjacent vertices,

165
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:12.800
different one symbol, uh, fine here.

166
00:10:12.801 --> 00:10:15.140
One zero one and one zero, zero.

167
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:19.550
<v 2>Is that the reason that the triple zero and the triple one are at opposite ends</v>

168
00:10:19.551 --> 00:10:20.384
of the queue?

169
00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:24.200
<v 0>Uh, they are, as far apart, you have to make three changes. One, two, three.</v>

170
00:10:24.201 --> 00:10:26.900
Of course, you can make those in, in many different ways,

171
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.640
but they have to be antipodal. So why are we looking at this? Well,

172
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:33.920
these correspond to the half placements,

173
00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.580
and now suppose that you were Charles.

174
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:42.620
I claim if you see two blue hats and blue is zero and

175
00:10:42.621 --> 00:10:46.670
red is one. You don't know whether you have red or blue.

176
00:10:46.671 --> 00:10:47.930
In some sense,

177
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:51.920
you are sitting on that edge of the cube and you want to know what to do.

178
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.930
Your choices are to name a hat color or pass.

179
00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:01.220
I'm going to put a dot on the edges in which you should pass and an

180
00:11:01.221 --> 00:11:04.130
arrow. So we know what Charles did.

181
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.620
He said red,

182
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:11.030
I'm recording the strategy on this cube. And here,

183
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:15.410
Alice says red here. Bob says red here,

184
00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.980
Charles sees two alike and therefore says the opposite.

185
00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.610
So there's this funny picture that emerges

186
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:29.120
what's happening here. Okay. Who is this? Well,

187
00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:32.090
the coordinate that changes is Alice.

188
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.600
So Alice sees blue and red.

189
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:40.580
So she knows that she's supposed to pass six edges have labels and

190
00:11:40.581 --> 00:11:43.670
the other six are all passes.

191
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:48.440
Somehow the magical secret of this is there two landmines

192
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.250
here and here. These are the times we lose the million dollars.

193
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.060
These are the hat placements,

194
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.850
and we don't want to step on a landmine.

195
00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:01.900
So we predict we aren't on the land mine.

196
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.900
And maybe rather than saying, we're not trying to step on it.

197
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:09.340
What we're really saying is that the landmine happens. We all three,

198
00:12:09.341 --> 00:12:13.240
want to get blown up at the same time. The magic way we've converted.

199
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:18.250
These coin flips into a three quarters advantage is to having all the correct

200
00:12:18.251 --> 00:12:20.470
answers in separate cases.

201
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:24.640
And the incorrect answers happen in two cases where everybody is incorrect.

202
00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.840
So if we have more than three players,

203
00:12:28.841 --> 00:12:33.550
the situation starts getting interesting. Let's consider four players.

204
00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:39.160
Well, one thing we know we can do in that case is in our strategy session.

205
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:42.220
Dave agrees to pass and Alice,

206
00:12:42.221 --> 00:12:44.350
Bob and Charlie play this game.

207
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.920
And what that means is the probability that team of four,

208
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:51.220
with that strategy is three quarters. Rather, surprisingly,

209
00:12:51.221 --> 00:12:54.130
they can't do any better than that. If there are five people,

210
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:57.790
there's a more complicated strategy. That is a little better.

211
00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:01.120
It's it's messier than this one is how I would describe it.

212
00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:05.200
Same with six people, all of a sudden with seven people.

213
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:10.330
There's a nice strategy. Again, it's not quite as easily described as this,

214
00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:15.070
but it gives you the best possible probability of success.

215
00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.560
If you work through what's happening here,

216
00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:22.510
the property that makes this work is that these two points

217
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:27.340
are adjacent to every point on the cube. Why is that necessary?

218
00:13:27.341 --> 00:13:32.260
Well, if you're talking about strategies and other is labeling in this way,

219
00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.320
it turns out that if you have a losing position,

220
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.950
you might as well have all arrows coming out from it.

221
00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:43.900
And the next little thing I'm leaving this for you to figure out in your mind,

222
00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:48.040
every Vertex either has to be in that losing set

223
00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.830
or adjacent to it. Okay?

224
00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:55.150
So now you can draw a four-dimensional cube. Well, what would that be?

225
00:13:55.151 --> 00:13:57.760
What is a four-dimensional cube? Um,

226
00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:01.630
it would have vertices labeled by all strings of length,

227
00:14:01.631 --> 00:14:05.200
four symbols of zeros in one they're 16 vertices.

228
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:07.330
And there's a lot of ways to draw that,

229
00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.600
but it really doesn't matter whether or not you can visualize these higher

230
00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:15.550
dimensional cubes. All you have to think about is these strings, zeros and ones.

231
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:16.810
So this makes,

232
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:20.380
gives you some way to at least think about the problem for any number of

233
00:14:20.381 --> 00:14:21.150
players.

234
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.850
<v 2>What if everyone in the world was playing? So.</v>

235
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.660
<v 0>So the magic numbers like seven,</v>

236
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.110
our powers of two minus one. And for those,

237
00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:36.000
these magic sets are completely explicit and they're called

238
00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:38.280
Hemmings single error, correcting codes.

239
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:43.320
They're perfect codes because they touch everything perfectly without

240
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:44.460
duplication.

241
00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:49.080
<v 2>Professor does that mean when we get to 15 players and when we get to</v>

242
00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:54.050
31 players, we see sudden jumps in the probability of winning well.

243
00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:56.770
<v 0>So when you come to 15 players,</v>

244
00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:59.470
you can describe a very nice solution.

245
00:14:59.471 --> 00:15:02.110
If we could find the best possible ones after that,

246
00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:06.460
the probability would slowly increase until at 31. It would again be nice.

247
00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.260
In fact, the numbers right below 31, it's not known what the best number is.

248
00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.810
So your probability winning is only going to go up,

249
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:18.610
but it's as elegant elegant solution within is a power of two minus one

250
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:23.770
of those places that failure probability is one over well in

251
00:15:23.771 --> 00:15:27.850
plus one, one over that power of two. So with 31 players,

252
00:15:27.851 --> 00:15:30.820
our chance of failing is one of our 32.

253
00:15:30.821 --> 00:15:35.710
Our chances of winning is 31 over 32. If it was the population of the planet,

254
00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:40.030
our chance of losing would be one over, well, I don't know, 4 billion.

255
00:15:40.031 --> 00:15:44.950
Let's say it's distinctive feature is that all the

256
00:15:44.951 --> 00:15:47.710
players have infinitely many hats.

257
00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:50.470
Each one of them equally likely to be blue or red.

258
00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:54.280
So here is just the beginning, uh, inflamed, many hats.

259
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:56.770
<v 2>That would go all the way, all the way up to the ceiling.</v>

260
00:15:56.770 --> 00:16:00.190
<v 0>And through, and now, um, maybe if they get smaller,</v>

261
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:02.710
it will only have finite height.

262
00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:06.340
So now the game sounds pretty impossible.

263
00:16:06.341 --> 00:16:11.140
You have some number of players, each players of course sees every.
