00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.920
<v 0>We have got a brilliant and very simple probability puzzle about a bull</v>

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.430
and a bag. Well, maybe there's more than one board, but before that,

3
00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:11.820
I want to tell you about this puzzle and the interesting about this puzzle,

4
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:14.640
which very few other puzzles you can say is it,

5
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:18.540
I know exactly the time it was invented.

6
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.550
It was invented by Lewis Carroll as he lay in bed on

7
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:28.110
the 8th of September, 1887.

8
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.033
How do I know that?

9
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.990
I know that because Lewis Carroll wrote a book of problems

10
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.710
that he called his pillow problems and he called them his pillow problems.

11
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.980
Because I don't know about you when you're trying to go to bed,

12
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.370
but Lewis Carroll, who I should really say,

13
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.320
maybe he doesn't even need to be introduced.

14
00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:48.960
He's the guy who wrote Alice's adventures in Wonderland.

15
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.600
He said that when you are lying in bed,

16
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.890
sometimes you are victim to skeptical thoughts,

17
00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.840
which seem for the moment to uproot the farmers' faith or blasphemous thoughts,

18
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.000
which dart unbidden into the most irreverent souls, and also unholy thoughts,

19
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.590
which torture with a hateful presence. The fancier that would Fain to be pure.

20
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.580
Okay. This is Lewis.

21
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.130
Carroll's introduction talking about all these terrible thoughts,

22
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.053
these naughty thoughts,

23
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.060
they're getting his head as a way to stop thinking these terrible things.

24
00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:19.680
He goes against all these,

25
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.880
some real mental work is a most helpful

26
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.040
ally. In other words,

27
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.110
do puzzles because they stop you at night in bed just

28
00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:32.610
before you're going to sleep.

29
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.930
<v 1>Alex, Alex, Alex, you've just written a whole book about puzzles.</v>

30
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.580
I have to say about you. Well, you're having unholy thoughts.

31
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.350
<v 0>Um, I'm having incredibly,</v>

32
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.820
incredibly unhealthy thoughts about all my puzzles all at the same time,

33
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.040
24 hours a day. Yeah.

34
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.850
<v 1>So Louis Carroll invented this puzzle.</v>

35
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.450
<v 0>But he did invent this puzzle. And um, in the book,</v>

36
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.860
he actually writes down the date by each puzzle of the evening or the night when

37
00:02:03.861 --> 00:02:06.080
he ends each puzzle, which is why I told you the day, the first place.

38
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.700
So this puzzle is fantastic because it's one of those probability puzzles,

39
00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:14.210
which means there's a kind of surprising, um, aha moment.

40
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.290
But it's incredibly simply stated what I have. I have a bag.

41
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.260
And in this bag, there is a ball.

42
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.420
You do not know the color of this ball. Exactly,

43
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.220
but we know it's either red or it's green and it can be either

44
00:02:31.221 --> 00:02:32.090
one. In fact,

45
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.600
we're going to say that the probability is equal of a being red or green.

46
00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:38.510
So in other words, the probability of this ball here is 50%.

47
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.430
Then the puzzle is just say, I have a bag with a 50% chance,

48
00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:46.550
bull and red bull and sign it. And I got another red bull.

49
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.160
This ball is red with a hundred percent certainty. We know this ball is red.

50
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.260
I'm going to put it in the bank.

51
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.750
I'm then going to randomly take a ball out,

52
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.340
hitting the ranting bull that, Oh, it's red.

53
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.040
What is the probability that the ball that is still in the bag is red.

54
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.160
Okay. Now, if I was to do this many times, I would say, in fact,

55
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.930
I've got a ball it's red put again, take one out is red.

56
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.570
In other words, all I'm doing is just putting a red bull in.

57
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.310
I'm taking a red bull out, putting a red bull in taking a red bull out.

58
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.450
The surprising thing is that it changes the probability of the ball that's

59
00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:34.090
inside. So what is that probability?

60
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.430
<v 1>So when you just did it once, what is the probability, are you saying?</v>

61
00:03:38.431 --> 00:03:41.130
What's the probability, depending on how many times you do the experiment?

62
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.220
<v 0>No, I'm saying what is the probability? When I do it,</v>

63
00:03:44.221 --> 00:03:47.100
once I have the ball, I put it in

64
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.140
To be very clear. I'm randomly taking one out.

65
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.980
It so happens that the rent one I ran, the release selected is red.

66
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.810
What are the challenges of this one? Still being read. Now, most people,

67
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.760
if they're not adept to probability problems, we'll look at this and think, huh?

68
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.580
You just put a Redwood in and we've taken a red one eyes.

69
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.950
How can it have changed the probability?

70
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.140
Because it seems natural that the one that's in there that we haven't

71
00:04:19.141 --> 00:04:21.600
seen, how can its probability of change.

72
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.890
But if you unpick the wave of the question is phrased.

73
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.780
The probability of this one does change kind of as if by

74
00:04:30.781 --> 00:04:33.900
magic. Do you want to think about it? And then we can maybe get solution.

75
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.670
<v 1>Do I have some thinking time?</v>

76
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.380
[inaudible].

77
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.430
<v 0>We're back. We're back. Essentially with these probability puzzles,</v>

78
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.670
we need to look at the sample space and kind of open up and look at the sample

79
00:04:50.671 --> 00:04:50.970
space.

80
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.890
I it's almost spaces look at all the things that are equally likely to happen.

81
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.410
So we've got a bag inside it.

82
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.450
We know that either there is a red bull or Greenville with 50%

83
00:05:03.451 --> 00:05:06.390
chance. One of the other tells a coin. So actually the sambal space,

84
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.520
we know that red bull and Greenville, this is equally likely.

85
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.420
Then I'm going to put the red bull in. So

86
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.843
this

87
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.290
is equally likely when I take one out,

88
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.680
either I'm taking this one art,

89
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.070
or I'm taking this one out,

90
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.440
or I'm taking this one out or I'm taking this one out,

91
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.290
but we know that the one I told you,

92
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.120
I selecting randomly these four ones that I take out are

93
00:05:42.121 --> 00:05:43.680
happening equal likelihood.

94
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.030
We can eliminate the green one being taken out because I told you when I took a

95
00:05:48.031 --> 00:05:52.680
random one out, it was red. In other words, I have either taken out this one,

96
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.910
this one or this one. If I took this one,

97
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.490
the one that is still in is red. If I took this one out,

98
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.160
the one that's still in Israel. If I take this one out,

99
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.800
the one that's still in his green, in other words,

100
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.000
still in for take this one out still in red.

101
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.860
If I take this one out, stood in red, I'll take this one out. Stood in green.

102
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.100
We have three different possibilities of a red one going at on two

103
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:26.690
of them, the one that's still in his red. So that's a two out of thirds,

104
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.950
66% chance. So I can redo it with my props.

105
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.860
This is red. This one, we don't know what it is.

106
00:06:33.861 --> 00:06:37.190
It's like the red or green and 50% chance of being either one. I put one in,

107
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.990
I randomly take one out. Oh, I randomly take the red one out.

108
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.880
The chance of this being red has now jumped up from 50 to 66%.

109
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.360
This is by magic. Amazing. Congratulations, Carol.

110
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.900
You've just invented by yourself a fantastic probability puzzle.

111
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.800
But more than that at the same time contemporaneously, I don't think they knew.

112
00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:59.810
Um, I was gonna say plastic, but

113
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.170
Well, Joseph patrol,

114
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.160
French mathematician invented a similar setup,

115
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.520
essentially the same math, which is called the Bertram box paradox.

116
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.570
And then a hundred years later it became the Monte hall paradox.

117
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.290
So this is actually, if you do the archeology of the Monty hall problem,

118
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.090
this is where it all began with Lewis Carroll in this Victorian nightcap

119
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.780
sitting in bed desperate, trying not to think blasphemous thoughts.

120
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:29.980
And he comes up with this puzzle.

121
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.910
<v 1>It seems to me, Alex, the key piece of information here,</v>

122
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.810
this moment where you took the green bowl out and revealed it to the audience,

123
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.690
you've raced that from existence.

124
00:07:40.691 --> 00:07:44.560
You've erased that possibility from human existence and the fact you've tampered

125
00:07:44.561 --> 00:07:45.850
with the universe in that way.

126
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.520
<v 0>That's that's true. The thing is,</v>

127
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:53.830
what we should have done is that I should really have taken one

128
00:07:53.831 --> 00:07:56.740
out at random and sometimes I would get a green one,

129
00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.530
but we've just leave those on the cutting room floor. Um,

130
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:02.710
so often with these probabilities,

131
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.980
we need to think about the problems is that it didn't happen.

132
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.960
I'm showing you a possible world,

133
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.960
but there are other equally likely possible worlds.

134
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.730
And the trick or the clue is that I say,

135
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.100
I randomly select one and take it out.

136
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.870
Lots of people won't actually register what that means because they will just

137
00:08:22.871 --> 00:08:25.210
see this as only putting one in and taking one out.

138
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.630
But actually we need to realize that for every time I put one in,

139
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.180
take one out three times, I'll come up with a red,

140
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.100
but one time we'll come up with a green.

141
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.120
And we're just because you didn't see that green, we're just

142
00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:39.521
forgetting about it.

143
00:08:39.521 --> 00:08:43.060
But actually you need to take that green into account as being something that

144
00:08:43.061 --> 00:08:43.990
could possibly have happened.

145
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.320
<v 1>In fact, so when you said, I randomly take a ball out,</v>

146
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.440
that's almost kind of like a little lies and that,

147
00:08:50.441 --> 00:08:55.030
because it's not random because you're not showing me the times the

148
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.020
came out.

149
00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:59.970
<v 0>In retrospect is not random making a video, but that,</v>

150
00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:04.440
that is the slight, it's not lying,

151
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:08.400
but that's a slight smoke and mirrors of a lot of these probability problems.

152
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.353
That's right.

153
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.350
<v 2>If you want to find out more about this kind of stuff,</v>

154
00:09:12.351 --> 00:09:15.980
then you really should check out brilliant today's episode sponsor in

155
00:09:15.981 --> 00:09:20.690
particular, have a look at these courses on conditional probability in a,

156
00:09:20.691 --> 00:09:23.390
see some familiar stuff there. And this one here,

157
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.330
perplexing probability is also a real classic.

158
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.530
Now all these courses have been handcrafted by the excellent people and

159
00:09:30.531 --> 00:09:31.160
brilliant.

160
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:35.630
And I like to think of them being a bit like Nepalese mountain guides,

161
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.120
taking you on a journey, through learning,

162
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.170
but with all the inside knowledge and knowing all the best routes and the best

163
00:09:42.171 --> 00:09:46.370
way to go to make the experience the best possible track.

164
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.800
They've got loads of courses. It's not just mathematics,

165
