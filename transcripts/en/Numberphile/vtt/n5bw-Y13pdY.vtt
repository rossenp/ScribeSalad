00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.210
<v 0>So I want to tell you about pustules purism, which is a Ferrum,</v>

2
00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:06.870
which blew the minds of 19th century mathematicians. Um,

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.430
it was a really exciting moment.

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.590
A lot of people tried to come up with their own proofs.

5
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.910
I'm not going to explain the proof.

6
00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:15.180
I just want to tell you what it's about and maybe a little bit about why it's so

7
00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:18.930
cool and surprising. And I have to admit, I don't know what a poor ism is.

8
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.530
Some people call it pustules closure theorem, but purism is so cool.

9
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.270
But that's what we're going to use today.

10
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.580
You didn't know what a poorer is and don't know what a poor person is.

11
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.610
<v 1>Well, Google that, but it means like a theorem or probably.</v>

12
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.880
<v 0>I, I don't even want to venture a guess. It could, it could mean anything.</v>

13
00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:39.140
So you start with two conics, but like two ellipses,

14
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.830
let's say one is inside the other. And what do you do?

15
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.600
You start with a point on one and you draw the tangent line to the other one

16
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.130
through that point, one of the tangent lines, and it intersects the other conic.

17
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.993
At some point,

18
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.100
now you can take this point and draw while we already have one tangent line

19
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.100
through this point and the second conic, but you draw the other one,

20
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.310
how you get a third point and you keep going and you draw out the tangent line

21
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.630
and you keep bouncing around.

22
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.060
Eventually, maybe you close up.

23
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.100
<v 1>So you might get back to where you started. So you might yeah.</v>

24
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.630
<v 0>Get back to where you started.</v>

25
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.980
After some number of times bouncing around this picture. You might not

26
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.130
here's the theorem. So suppose you eventually get back to where you started.

27
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.510
So you started at this point,

28
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.850
you bounced around a lot and eventually you come back.

29
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.050
Then the same thing happens if you start at any point.

30
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.140
So all you have to know is that if you start here,

31
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.930
you bounce around you come back. Well, what happens if you started here?

32
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.040
The same thing would be true.

33
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.380
You'd bounced around a bunch of times and eventually you'd come back to where

34
00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:56.570
you started. So that's [inaudible]

35
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.280
and.

36
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.070
<v 1>By extension, if you don't come back to where you started,</v>

37
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.580
that's also true for any point. Yes.

38
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.340
<v 0>Right? Because if it was true for some other point,</v>

39
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.920
then while you would know, there's some point where you start in,

40
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.660
bounced around. So for your original point,

41
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.390
you'd also by the same theorem have to bounce around.

42
00:02:17.391 --> 00:02:22.220
You can come back to where you started. That's the result. So,

43
00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:25.820
okay. So why was this so exciting? I'm not going to say much about the proof,

44
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.900
but the reason why is that the proof used some objects, huddle, elliptic curves,

45
00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:32.540
or elliptic functions, which were really exciting at the time.

46
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.450
And everyone had to come up with their own proof of this using elliptic

47
00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:36.950
functions or elliptic curves.

48
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.940
And people were still doing that as late as like the 1960s or 1970s,

49
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.850
including some of the giants of algebraic geometry.

50
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.970
<v 1>So that was the shiny new toy of mathematics at the time.</v>

51
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.350
And I think it was just really exciting.

52
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.650
<v 0>There's some, you know, fairly elementary statement you could make,</v>

53
00:02:51.651 --> 00:02:55.340
that you could apply is really fancy. New tools is really exciting and,

54
00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.190
you know, beautiful objects to study and improve. What's the first using.

55
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.590
<v 1>That or was it already proven? And then people came along and said,</v>

56
00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:03.760
I bet we could do that with elliptic.

57
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.870
<v 0>What happened was peninsula is proof didn't, uh,</v>

58
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.870
didn't intrinsically use these ideas or didn't,

59
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.870
he didn't know maybe he was using these ideas. And then a little bit later,

60
00:03:12.871 --> 00:03:14.730
Jacoby came along and he was like, Oh,

61
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.560
I know how to prove this using elliptic integrals.

62
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.600
But this was right at the beginning of the time,

63
00:03:18.601 --> 00:03:20.790
people were starting to understand elliptic curves,

64
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.360
which actually came from some interest in calculus problems or elliptic

65
00:03:24.361 --> 00:03:27.990
integrals. And so, uh, I think the excitement came from, you know,

66
00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:30.300
people looking at Palm solos proof and realizing, Oh,

67
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.190
there's something really beautiful happening here.

68
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.710
<v 1>What properties of the ellipses make a joining star?</v>

69
00:03:37.711 --> 00:03:40.320
And what ones make them not join? Or is it just a random thing.

70
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.170
<v 0>That there's, there's some, uh,</v>

71
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.340
some really beautiful geometry hidden here associated to these two contacts.

72
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.030
There's a sort of diagram like this. So it's a,

73
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.570
some kind of parallelogram or you think of these sides as the same.

74
00:03:54.571 --> 00:03:55.920
And these sides is the same.

75
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.430
So actually this is one way of thinking about what the curve is,

76
00:03:59.431 --> 00:04:03.660
a picture like this, and also is associated to it a little arrow. So a vector.

77
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.890
And here's another thing you can do just like this and other kind of operation.

78
00:04:07.891 --> 00:04:11.640
You can perform on a picture like this. You can add the vector to itself,

79
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.260
so you can do this and then do this. And well, maybe you get here,

80
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.060
but that's the same as this point.

81
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.150
Cause we said that these two sites were the same, but do this, do this.

82
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.120
And that's the same as this point. Just the same as this point.

83
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.290
And the way we can tell if you wrap around and get to where you get is exactly

84
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.810
this. If the same thing is true on this picture, if,

85
00:04:30.811 --> 00:04:33.240
once you add the specter to itself, enough times,

86
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.590
you get back to where you started.

87
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.610
So this is the associated elliptic curve.

88
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.840
I don't see the link between the parallelogram and the yeah. It's I,

89
00:04:41.841 --> 00:04:45.930
I haven't told it to. Yeah. So in fact, I can say a little bit about it.

90
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.010
So what you do is you identify this with, let me give the conics names.

91
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.820
So this inner one is C and this one is D so you identify this with the set of

92
00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:55.650
points, C and D,

93
00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.690
where C is a point of C and D is a point of D and the

94
00:05:00.691 --> 00:05:05.220
line through C and D is tangent to C

95
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:06.780
to point C.

96
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.350
And it turns out there's a natural way to go from the set to this parallelogram

97
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.810
in particular, it has this kind of additional law on it.

98
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.850
<v 1>So if I said to you, Daniel,</v>

99
00:05:14.851 --> 00:05:18.750
I want you to draw two ellipses that will work,

100
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.150
that will create this cool property.

101
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.490
You would use that to try to reverse engineer.

102
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.820
<v 2>Okay, cool. Yeah.</v>

103
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.120
<v 1>It's funny. When you started talking about elliptic curves,</v>

104
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.830
you didn't draw a single curve line.

105
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.640
<v 0>Right? Yeah. So, so a, an elliptic curve, people often draws looking at like,</v>

106
00:05:35.641 --> 00:05:36.570
something like this.

107
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.580
So that's the real solutions to an equation that looks like

108
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.690
this. But, uh, if you, instead, you look at the complex solutions,

109
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.910
you've got a picture like this. So, and so in fact, this is,

110
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.630
if you think about gluing this side to this side and this side to this side.

111
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.053
<v 2>You've got.</v>

112
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.790
<v 0>A donut and what's this picture as well.</v>

113
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.750
This loop goes over here and this one is kind of something shadow of a loop over

114
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:06.030
here. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

120
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:26.493
probability.

121
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.260
