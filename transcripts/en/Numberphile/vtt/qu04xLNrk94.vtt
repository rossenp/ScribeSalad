00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.240
<v 0>I'm going to start it off with a puzzle, just, just to get us going.</v>

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.250
So I've taken the ACEs, the Kings, the Queens and jacks out of a deck of cards.

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.850
So you can see I've arranged them in a four by four grid and the positives.

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.330
Can you arrange these cards so that every row,

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.360
every column and the two diagonals have a nice a

6
00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:20.900
King,

7
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.760
a queen Jack in them and every

8
00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:28.100
row column and the diagnose.

9
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.600
I also want them to include a club, a heart, a space,

10
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.930
and a diamond. It's like a Sudoku. It is like a Stokey.

11
00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:39.740
So try it out is it should be the same kind of thing. As, as though CU uh,

12
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.070
there is a solution I'm not trying to catch you out. There are many solutions,

13
00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:47.600
so try and find a solution. How many solutions can you find? My Rose? Okay.

14
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.010
Already working. I've got ACE King queen Jack in each row,

15
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.020
and I've got Cope's heart spit diamond in each row, but my columns, they work,

16
00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.160
what do I need to do this ACE? Can't be in the same column as an ACE.

17
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.860
I don't want to put it there either.

18
00:01:02.861 --> 00:01:05.600
I can't have hearts in the same column as heart.

19
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.000
What about if I just swap these two over this season, along with that, I don't,

20
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.370
Oh, I've got my Kings though, in the same column.

21
00:01:13.371 --> 00:01:18.290
So maybe I can swap those two over. If I keep thinking about it,

22
00:01:18.291 --> 00:01:22.610
I want my diagonals to be like this as well. I've got a club and a club.

23
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.380
Maybe I can swap the Jack and the queen, Ava, keep going like this.

24
00:01:27.381 --> 00:01:31.130
So you keep trying this out, swapping them over, seeing what's works.

25
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.630
If you're like me,

26
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.430
you're probably going to find yourself getting into a stock place at some point

27
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.200
where it's just not working.

28
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.400
So what I recommend is you do treat it like a Sudoku, do it, pen and paper.

29
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.420
I think it works out better. So here's my Sudoku kind of version.

30
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.800
I know what the sort of thing I want. I want an eight, a King,

31
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.110
a queen, and a Jack in every row column diagonal.

32
00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.170
I want club, heart spade,

33
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.160
diamond doing the same thing. And so then, yeah, let's just think it through,

34
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.950
let's do the ACEs and let's see where it fits on the next row.

35
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.230
So it can't be in the first column.

36
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.200
It can't be on the diagonal matching without ACE.

37
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.160
So it could be in the third or fourth box or for no reason,

38
00:02:16.161 --> 00:02:19.070
let's put it in the third box. Let's see what happens when I do that.

39
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.480
If I do that, that does help.

40
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.850
I'm going to look at the fourth row because I can't do this first column.

41
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.780
I can't do that the third column. And I can't do the diagonal either.

42
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.530
So I can't be in that box at the end. So it has to be there,

43
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.550
which means I now know where the last ACE goes. It has to be on the third row,

44
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.140
fourth box. So it's nice and pleasing and essence though, kind of way.

45
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.120
And the suits are the same. And if I did clubs, it can't be the first column.

46
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.380
Can't be the diagonal.

47
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.740
It can't be here because I've already got ACE of clubs or ready,

48
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.890
which means it has to be in the last box on the row.

49
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.790
Where else could my clubs go? Well, if I look at the fourth row,

50
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.310
it's not the first column.

51
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.380
It's not the fourth column and it can't be ACE of clubs. Again, puts it there.

52
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.180
And then that forces the last club to go here, I think,

53
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.130
and you just carry on and not way,

54
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.440
here's one of the possible solutions you could do.

55
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.870
So the last row is going to be, we're gonna need the King.

56
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.270
We will need the ACE.

57
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.740
We will need the Jack I'm right there in the bottom queen of hearts.

58
00:03:32.741 --> 00:03:35.860
And that should work every row, every column.

59
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.060
And the two diagonals as well has an ACE King queen and Jack,

60
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.510
and also one of each suit clubs, hearts, spades, and diamonds.

61
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.220
It's kind of like a Latin square. Latin squares are quite famous.

62
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.580
It's kind of like a double Latin gray, really Latin square.

63
00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:56.320
I would have four objects and I want these four objects to appear

64
00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.820
in each row. And each column, it doesn't have to be the diagonals, by the way,

65
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:02.770
I diagnosed this fun for a puzzle,

66
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:04.720
but it's not going to be what we're going to do for the maths.

67
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.680
If I just had them as a, B, C, and D,

68
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.540
I want ABC and D to be in every row and every column without

69
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.250
matching up. So I could have a, B, C,

70
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.630
D a, B, C, D a,

71
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.430
B, C, and D. That's a Latin square. Yeah.

72
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.500
What we're doing is kind of a double Latin square.

73
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.010
I could do another Latin square in the same boxes. I'll use the numbers one,

74
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:35.590
two, three, and four this time. So it looks different.

75
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.990
So we can start off with one, two, three, and four,

76
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.880
and then fill in the rest of them.

77
00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:44.260
So it's a Latin square and I want each combination to appeal

78
00:04:44.261 --> 00:04:48.940
once only. So if I do the rest of it, it would be one,

79
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.260
two, three, four, one, two, three,

80
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.370
four one two, three, four, like there.

81
00:04:57.371 --> 00:05:01.120
So there's two Latin squares and they're kind of superimposed on top of each

82
00:05:01.121 --> 00:05:01.630
other,

83
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.130
but every combination occurs once it's called a Greco

84
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.300
Latin square.

85
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.720
And it sounds like a pure mass thing has loads of applications and

86
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.260
real life maths.

87
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.400
And I was taught it in statistics and it doesn't sound like something you would

88
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:19.690
be taught in statistics,

89
00:05:19.691 --> 00:05:23.620
but it something that you would use when you're designing experiments,

90
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.570
imagine your organizing some sort of tournament.

91
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.410
Um, what a ping pong tournament. Okay. You got the ping pong tournament.

92
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.730
Very exciting. It's a four day tournament, right? It's a big deal.

93
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.260
And you've got team letters and team numbers. If I use this.

94
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:46.210
So on the first team it's ABC and D on the second team, one, two,

95
00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:47.230
three, and four.

96
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.150
And let's say your slots for playing games are ATM 10:00 AM.

97
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.470
And then there's a 2:00 PM slot and a 4:00 PM slot.

98
00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.250
Isn't it bit unfair. If you have to play at 8:00 AM, first thing in the morning,

99
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.090
you might not be in playing at your best. So it would be fairer.

100
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.320
If every player got to play a game at 8:00 AM.

101
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.880
If every player got to play one of the slots,

102
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.260
then that would be a fair thing to do. And that's what's happened here.

103
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.770
It would also be fair. If every player a B, C,

104
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:26.330
D gets to compete against every player, one, two, three, four,

105
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.230
and that's what's happened.

106
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.700
You've arranged the tournament so that every player gets to play each opponent

107
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.960
and every player gets to play in each slot.

108
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.430
So everything's nice and fair, but also it allows you to make comparisons.

109
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.290
Let's say I wanted to compare player a player C I can compare them

110
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.730
because both players I've played in each slot and

111
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.180
both players have played all the other opponents.

112
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:58.010
So if you add up their total score, you can tell, which is the better player,

113
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.800
these, this idea for designing experiments.

114
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.440
So there aren't these little hidden biases,

115
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.420
so you can arrange your experiments so that those kinds of biases all spread

116
00:07:08.421 --> 00:07:11.660
out and everyone has put in the same situation.

117
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.960
So then you can make comparisons between two different things.

118
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.320
So this works for a four by four square.

119
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.660
Does it work for other sizes? Okay. Two by two, three by three,

120
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.440
find it doesn't work for a two by two square. It's too small. Just doesn't work.

121
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.210
We have a, and B and well, let's put a B here.

122
00:07:32.211 --> 00:07:36.680
I've relaxed the diagonal rule now. And we've got one and two now,

123
00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:38.870
where am I going to put number one here?

124
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.540
I can't put it there because I've already done this.

125
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.000
And I can't put it here because it would be in the same column.

126
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.690
You'll find that you can't do it for two by two square, too small.

127
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.080
It's impossible. You can do it for a three by three.

128
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:53.390
So if you've got a prime number size,

129
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:57.080
a nice though rule is let's start with ABC.

130
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:59.810
Let's take the first Latin square and for each row,

131
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.780
I'm going to advance it one place across.

132
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:07.580
So now I'm going to start on the second square and there'll be a, B, C,

133
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:13.160
and then for the next row, a, B, C for my next Latin square, with one,

134
00:08:13.161 --> 00:08:17.270
two and three, I'm going to advance them two steps across.

135
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.320
So for the next row, let's move it two steps along and have one,

136
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:26.780
two, and three. And then from the next row, let's go another two steps along.

137
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:31.100
So go one, two and three, and you say, Hey, that works.

138
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.010
So we've got this Greco Latin square. There's liberal,

139
00:08:34.011 --> 00:08:37.610
Latin square for three by three. We do it for five by five as well.

140
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:38.733
<v 1>Because he's a prime member.</v>

141
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.190
<v 0>So obviously the next question is a six by six. Does it work for six, five, six?</v>

142
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.820
That's difficult. In fact,

143
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:53.770
so difficult that famous mathematician Euler

144
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.160
got involved. Uh, so it's,

145
00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.720
it's got a special need because it's a special case. It has a special name.

146
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:03.510
They call it the 36 officer problem.

147
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:08.460
So you've got six regiments and each regimens has six officers

148
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.420
of different rank. And you want to arrange them into one of these squares.

149
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:16.830
So you've got different ranks and different regiments in rows and columns,

150
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.580
Euler near the end of his life. He thought I'm going to try this problem out.

151
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:25.200
He came up with loads of different methods for

152
00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:29.370
designing these Greco, Latin squares,

153
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:33.990
all these different algorithms and methods for making them for constructing

154
00:09:33.991 --> 00:09:38.520
them. And he made three by three, four by four or five by five,

155
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:42.540
seven by seven. He could make eight by eight, nine by nine.

156
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:47.100
Everything that he tried failed for six by six.

157
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:51.120
And he said, I don't think it can be done. I keep trying. It keeps failing.

158
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:55.020
I've not found a single solution. If there is a solution,

159
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.530
it's going to be some kind of crazy irregular pattern.

160
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.450
I don't think it can be done.

161
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:05.460
And I can't see a way of showing it without just checking every possibility.

162
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:09.660
So he said, well, two by two, can't be done.

163
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:14.280
Six by six. Can't be done. And for the same reason,

164
00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:17.190
he decided 10 by 10 squares.

165
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:22.020
Can't be done 14 by 14 squares. Can't be done.

166
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:26.850
Odd numbers, fine. He could do the multiples of four. So four, eight,

167
00:10:26.851 --> 00:10:30.090
and 12. And all of that, that's fine. You could do that.

168
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.660
But all the other even numbers he couldn't solve.

169
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:38.850
So he conjectured, I used to become a conjecture. They were impossible.

170
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:43.740
Can't be done. And it was a conjecture for a long time.

171
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:47.850
Well, it was proven in 1901,

172
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.600
a hundred years ago, French mathematician gust on Terry.

173
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:54.600
He proved it by checking every possibility,

174
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:58.890
which is 9,408 possibilities.

175
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.840
And he showed that the six by six grid is

176
00:11:03.841 --> 00:11:07.380
impossible. It can't be done. Father was right. So when it was right,

177
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:11.790
the six by six is impossible. I don't want to be fair to gust on Terry.

178
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:14.590
He did have a general proof. He wants a proper mathematician.

179
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:19.230
He had a general proof, but he also checked every possibility, which is funnier.

180
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.920
How did.

181
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.140
<v 2>He do it? Because he didn't have computers. Did he's manually do it.</v>

182
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:25.170
<v 0>And he manually did it exactly for the next question,</v>

183
00:11:25.171 --> 00:11:29.970
of course is 10 by 10 impossible. Now, wow.

184
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.270
That's going to be a lot of cases to check. You want to check those.

185
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:38.280
That was an open problem for a bit longer until someone proved that

186
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:42.390
they're impossible. The, the tens, the fourteens, the eighteens, the 20 twos,

187
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.960
they're impossible. They can't be done. That was proven in the 1920s.

188
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:52.080
The proof was wrong. The proof was wrong,

189
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:56.500
but it went unnoticed for 30 years until

190
00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:00.400
1959, an Indian mathematician called Raj Bose,

191
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:04.120
who was working in the same kind of area. Look to the proof.

192
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:10.620
That's funny, funny, there's something wrong about that. And he went,

193
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:15.820
I'm going to try and construct one of these impossible grids I needed

194
00:12:15.821 --> 00:12:20.620
mathematically. He could able construct a 22 by 20 cheaper.

195
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:25.000
So that was one of these that was meant to be impossible. So this huge grid,

196
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:29.920
double Latin square, and he could make it, which shows that yeah,

197
00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:33.370
oil was wrong. That there was a 22 by 22 example,

198
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:36.850
and then working with other mathematicians. And also,

199
00:12:36.851 --> 00:12:39.480
this was one of the early uses of computers.

200
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.220
We're talking about 1950s computers as well.

201
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.790
They could get a 10 by 10 example,

202
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:50.080
10 lots of to cut us up superimposed. It's a beautiful image.

203
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.790
I say they had examples where, where they could construct them.

204
00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:59.350
Uh, oil was wrong. They could do a 10 by 10. They could do a 22 by 22.

205
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.440
They called them [inaudible] spoilers.

206
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:05.950
I think it's a kind of a joke is kind of a joke.

207
00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:11.560
So they had these and then very quickly they could prove it in general,

208
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:17.170
10, 14, 1822, these ones that were meant to be impossible.

209
00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.250
They were not impossible. They could prove it. They could be done.

210
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.510
Now we have a way to directly construct them as quite involved,

211
00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:30.130
but we can actually create these supposedly impossible

212
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.680
grits. So that means only two and six is impossible to,

213
00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:39.880
I'm not surprised by it's this small. It's just too small to work.

214
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:44.980
Six. I find surprising, especially cause three, four, five work,

215
00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.720
six doesn't work.

216
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:50.830
It's this really kind of strange one odd one out,

217
00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.470
and then all the other numbers work.

218
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.000
So the moral of the story is even a great mathematician.

219
00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:03.310
One of history's great mathematicians, even someone like Euler can be wrong.

220
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:08.440
And of course never arranged a ping pong tournament. We have 16 members.

221
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.200
<v 3>Thanks so much for watching this.</v>

222
00:14:13.201 --> 00:14:16.920
Some more footage from this interview on our extras channel called number file

223
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:18.240
two.

224
00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.030
<v 0>Two Latin squares on top of each other. Can we do three?</v>

225
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:24.990
Here's a four by four as I add another Latin square to it.

226
00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:28.980
So I'm going to use circles plus triangles.

227
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.180
<v 3>And squares,</v>

228
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.020
and a huge thank you to those of you who are able to support us on Patrion.

229
00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.690
That support lets us add a few bells and whistles,

230
00:14:36.691 --> 00:14:38.370
more animations and things like that.

231
00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.520
Some of your names are on the screen at the moment that are playing a bit of

232
00:14:41.521 --> 00:14:44.100
ping pong. And if you go to the number fire website,

233
00:14:44.101 --> 00:14:49.050
you can see the full list of all our supporters. For more information,
