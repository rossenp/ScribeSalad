00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.180
<v 0>Nothing is moving in a circle, each one of these dots.</v>

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.360
<v 1>Straight line. Nice. Talk about burying the lead.</v>

3
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.340
That's the best bit. Is that the best bit?

4
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.500
<v 0>I want to show you an animation that I like,</v>

5
00:00:15.501 --> 00:00:16.430
and I'm going to give too much away.

6
00:00:16.431 --> 00:00:18.530
I would like to know your opinion of this animation.

7
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:19.363
<v 1>So.</v>

8
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.640
<v 0>There are two yellow blobs. I'll give you that for free.</v>

9
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.350
I'm curious what you see happen.

10
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.470
<v 1>Honey. It's kind of like they're rotating around each other. Go.</v>

11
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.680
<v 0>On. Say more. So, so if I talk about this door, yeah.</v>

12
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.050
<v 1>It's like, it's drawing a circle, you know, it's,</v>

13
00:00:32.051 --> 00:00:35.210
it's looping around the other one or they are the ones looping around here.

14
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.553
<v 0>By the way. Doesn't it?</v>

15
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.410
What I like about this animation is I've shown lots of people as animation,

16
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.060
but they see different things. So some people see this orbiting thing. One,

17
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:43.910
one is all, but in the other, but the other one keeps moving.

18
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.250
Is that a fair description of what you saw? Yeah.

19
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.280
Other people see straight lines. Oh, I definitely see straight line. Okay.

20
00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:52.640
So there's definitely a straight line emotion and maybe it's obviously there and

21
00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:53.960
there, but at the same time,

22
00:00:53.961 --> 00:00:57.470
other people are insistent that there's some sort of circular orbits if flavor,

23
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.430
which is a first of all,

24
00:00:58.431 --> 00:01:01.610
I like because straight lines or circles feel opposites in some sense,

25
00:01:01.611 --> 00:01:03.710
I know there's a mathematical sense where they might be the same two,

26
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.310
but both of them are seen by people in a naive description of what's happening.

27
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.530
I ended up building an animation on this when I was at school.

28
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.540
Cause I was curious about what this motion actually was.

29
00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:13.670
And that's how I learned to program in visual basic.

30
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.970
I've rebuilt this one in Joe Debra. I'm going to show you how I built it.

31
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.650
And also why a building,

32
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.100
you are right to talk about orbiting things and also writes it up about the

33
00:01:22.101 --> 00:01:23.780
straight lines. If I put these lines on,

34
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.780
it's really obvious that one of them is going up and down one them's going left

35
00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:28.490
to right, but they always dodgy each other.

36
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.510
And I didn't make the move like this by putting the straight lines on what I did

37
00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:35.630
was I made the circle around the outside exist.

38
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.870
It's still not obvious to me how they works, but I made this point also exists.

39
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.630
So this blue point moving around is how I built this file,

40
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.210
that blue dot controls, the yellow, in fact,

41
00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:47.540
the one going up and down is precisely just the vertical.

42
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.460
<v 1>Coordinator of the blue dot.</v>

43
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.390
<v 0>It's just tracking wherever the blue.is in a vertical axis.</v>

44
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.670
This is like the projection of it onto a vertical thing.

45
00:01:55.671 --> 00:01:57.830
And the horizontal one is just the horizontal projection.

46
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.430
The reason why we see sort of circular motion going on is because it's driven by

47
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.220
a circular motion. It's possible that you saw something else,

48
00:02:04.221 --> 00:02:07.670
which was the connected between these dots is a natural thing to sort of see

49
00:02:07.671 --> 00:02:10.760
because it's actually always the same length is equidistant and that's a fluke.

50
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.120
And some people in their head are kind of averaging the two dots.

51
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.100
And they're seeing the midpoint of the two dots,

52
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.070
literally the average position that he does, and that is moving in a circle,

53
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.210
which is really nice.

54
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.810
There's a bunch of a mechanical constructions called a Trammel of Archimedes

55
00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:28.070
where you can draw a circle from two things, moving in straight lines.

56
00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:29.870
And it's a mechanical way of drawing a perfect circle.

57
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.280
You just constrain these two dots.

58
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.200
<v 1>To move in straight lines. I didn't say that.</v>

59
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.830
<v 0>A lot of people don't see it, but they,</v>

60
00:02:34.831 --> 00:02:36.860
they feel there's something intuitively circular going on.

61
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.050
So let me go back to the reason why I built the thing.

62
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.900
The yellow points are the coordinates of the blueprint.

63
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.190
Let's just focus on the vertical one.

64
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.760
What do you think would happen if I track the vertical position of that over

65
00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:49.880
time, essentially drew a graph. What will that graph be?

66
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.170
Next time we start on the right side.

67
00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:53.630
I'm going to track the Y coordinate and you'll just see a graph, which means.

68
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.550
<v 1>It's familiar. Any, any thoughts? Brady is this like a sine curve or something?</v>

69
00:02:58.551 --> 00:03:00.190
It is precisely assigned curve.

70
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.010
<v 0>In fact, it's not just any Sancho. It is, is the sidekick.</v>

71
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.930
So I was a teacher for a long time. I was teaching people,

72
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:07.390
trigonometry sign and co-sign turnip.

73
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.080
And every single time I ever had a class learning that they will sorry.

74
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.890
<v 1>What is sine? And what is it?</v>

75
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.140
<v 0>And there are lots of answers.</v>

76
00:03:16.141 --> 00:03:19.140
People think of it as a ratio opposite in hypotony use that might be familiar

77
00:03:19.141 --> 00:03:22.380
words. Other people think of as a function has got an input and output.

78
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.010
These things are true. But what I like about a third answer,

79
00:03:26.011 --> 00:03:28.080
I'm going to give you now is that it captures both of them.

80
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.680
Sign is the Y coordinate of a point moving in a circle, interestingly,

81
00:03:31.681 --> 00:03:33.150
nothing to do with triangles,

82
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.410
despite the name trigonometry coming from Tricon Metri, measuring triangles.

83
00:03:37.411 --> 00:03:41.310
I think it was the worst named topic in mathematics sign is a circular function.

84
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.353
In fact,

85
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.630
it's one of these circular functions because there's another coordinate we

86
00:03:45.631 --> 00:03:48.840
haven't tracked here. So let's just do that one, the horizontal one moving left,

87
00:03:48.841 --> 00:03:50.490
and right there, if I track that going upwards,

88
00:03:50.491 --> 00:03:51.570
you only see the beginning of it.

89
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.330
It's not going to be a huge surprise when you realize that it traces out the

90
00:03:54.331 --> 00:03:55.350
beginning of a co-sign way.

91
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.360
And if you flip that back down, you'd see the co-sign wave,

92
00:04:00.361 --> 00:04:02.880
which is precisely the same as a sine wave, but shifted long.

93
00:04:02.881 --> 00:04:04.470
It's just like the circles going round a bit.

94
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.420
So sign and co-sign as functions or as mathematical objects are precisely the Y

95
00:04:09.421 --> 00:04:11.790
coordinate and X coordinate of a point moving in a circle.

96
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.300
That's why they're important because almost everything that goes in a cycle

97
00:04:15.301 --> 00:04:18.120
repeats ever, I E most things are described by circles.

98
00:04:18.121 --> 00:04:19.380
And therefore described by trigonometry.

99
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.660
<v 1>Is a coastline way, very different to a sideways.</v>

100
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.150
<v 0>Then it's exactly the same literally sine waves there.</v>

101
00:04:24.151 --> 00:04:25.440
And the co-sign wave is the same way.

102
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.230
Shifted is the sign of the other angle that's going on.

103
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:29.520
There's no obvious angles,

104
00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:31.650
but triangles have angles and we use trigonometry with angles.

105
00:04:31.651 --> 00:04:35.490
So the angle comes from, if I draw the radius on from the center of this thing,

106
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.040
the angle gives me a way of measuring where the blue.is at any point.

107
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.280
So the angle of zero, there is the angle the radius makes,

108
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.380
and that's where you do sign of an angle and it gives you a coordinate.

109
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.490
And so the co-sign is actually a sign of the other angle is the angle between

110
00:04:47.491 --> 00:04:49.520
the vertical and this radius instead of the horizontal.

111
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.180
And that's why I signed co-sign and basically the same.

112
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.510
I love the fact that seeing this move makes me understand trigonometry.

113
00:04:54.511 --> 00:04:56.610
There's not a triangle insight until you put that radius back on,

114
00:04:56.611 --> 00:04:58.410
and then you can see there's a right-angle triangle.

115
00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.940
That's kind of sweeping around inside here.

116
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.450
And that's why trigonometry is to do with write down with triangles is because X

117
00:05:03.451 --> 00:05:07.020
and Y coordinates are right angles and the radius makes the hypotenuse,

118
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.180
but that means sign. And co-sign, I like two aspects of the same motion.

119
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.290
It's just a different perspective. And when someone pointed this out,

120
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.850
could you draw it in three dimensions?

121
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.120
<v 1>And.</v>

122
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.570
<v 0>I got this on Joe Jabra at the inspiration of a student I was teaching at the</v>

123
00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:24.210
time. So let me show you a three-dimensional version of this.

124
00:05:24.211 --> 00:05:27.030
So there's my circle. I had originally, that's the view we had before.

125
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.080
That's the same motion I just had. Five-year from a three-dimensional mode.

126
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.850
I've got this axis going off into the distance.

127
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.760
We've got to track the position of a and time is now going to go sort of back in.

128
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.880
<v 1>Into that direction. And we're going.</v>

129
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.180
<v 0>To project the point along the axis. I'm going to start it now.</v>

130
00:05:42.181 --> 00:05:44.280
And you see that point going off into space.

131
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.400
It's kind of hard to see without moving your head around in a three-dimensional

132
00:05:47.401 --> 00:05:50.550
world so I can put the path on and you can see maybe not surprisingly that you

133
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.670
got sort of spiral coming out. And I reckon most people will predict that,

134
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.470
but that means the sign and co-sign are precisely somehow in that spiral.

135
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.330
Cause there are just aspects of that spiral.

136
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.780
<v 2>If you look from the side, there's the sign wave,</v>

137
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.130
which means.

138
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.180
<v 0>I want to see the co-sign wave.</v>

139
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.890
You should probably look from the top of the bottom,

140
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.800
Oh, sign wave. You can see it's the same way if it starts in a different place.

141
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.120
And if you go back to the front again,

142
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.460
they're all just a projection of a circle.

143
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.980
And so signing co-sign co-signer useful because they are the sort of

144
00:06:20.981 --> 00:06:23.380
compressions of circular motion in one dimension.

145
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.260
And I thought these 3d diagram of that really helped me understand where this

146
00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:26.650
comes from.

147
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.950
It does beg the question that there's a third trig function that most people

148
00:06:29.951 --> 00:06:30.784
know.

149
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.120
<v 1>And I haven't shown you that yet. Tan, tan.</v>

150
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.090
Do you know what time is short for breeding? Isn't it tangent? Yeah,

151
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.960
what's a tangent. I mean, I'm in full teacher mode now, but I think,

152
00:06:40.961 --> 00:06:45.080
you know what a tangent is. It's a line like going off, like grazing a circle.

153
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.680
<v 0>Yeah. So tangent from Latin for touching.</v>

154
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.500
So tangent is something just touch the curve. Doesn't have to be a circle.

155
00:06:50.501 --> 00:06:52.720
The word comes from precisely. That sets up.

156
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.240
This is a slightly more advanced file. I can show you all of the things.

157
00:06:55.241 --> 00:06:56.860
First of all, reminder to sign function.

158
00:06:56.861 --> 00:06:59.530
And there's the graph we're building and co-sign is the other direction.

159
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.870
And you can see the graphs arriving, tracing their way out.

160
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.750
Tangent comes from drawing a tangent.

161
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.200
But if I drew a tangent vertically to the place where we start all this motion

162
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.080
and I track where the radius line would hit,

163
00:07:11.081 --> 00:07:14.350
the tangent you'll get a situation that looks like this there's the tangent

164
00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:17.560
line. And the radius line will always cut the tangent line somewhere.

165
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.290
And then this green length is precisely the tangent function.

166
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.760
It is also the gradient of the radius because tangent is defined to be sign of a

167
00:07:24.761 --> 00:07:28.330
co-sign. It was kind of a huge relief to me personally, the word tangent,

168
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.970
wasn't a coincidence with the other definition of tangent,

169
00:07:30.971 --> 00:07:32.680
which is a line that just touches the circle.

170
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.770
These three graphs are all related to a circle.

171
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.330
They're all really geometrical things.

172
00:07:37.331 --> 00:07:40.480
They're not really do triangles except by accident because of the coordinate

173
00:07:40.481 --> 00:07:44.320
axes. And there are three more functions. You learn at a level at school,

174
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:48.820
which are one over these functions. So, uh, sec Cosequin caught,

175
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.360
I went over these three and there also on this diagram, if I turn on co sec,

176
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:55.480
co sec, otherwise known as one over sign, just like sign,

177
00:07:55.481 --> 00:07:57.100
which is a vertical Langleys diagram.

178
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.490
Coset is where the tangent cuts the vertical axis.

179
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.890
And you can see a sign gets bigger, coset gets smaller.

180
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.110
And then the same at one point. And then it goes back the other way.

181
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.750
So this U shaped graph here is the coset function,

182
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.040
otherwise known as one oversight.

183
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.950
And the same thing happens with CIC is where the tangent insects,

184
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:17.020
the X axis and caught one over 10 ends up being the other tangent

185
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.710
across the top here is where the radius intersects that all of the trick

186
00:08:20.711 --> 00:08:23.470
functions that we learn at school are actually audited with circles,

187
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.290
which is why they are called the circular functions.

188
00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.510
And I kind of wish we caught trigonometry the circular functions from the word

189
00:08:34.511 --> 00:08:36.220
go. Even if the use,

190
00:08:36.221 --> 00:08:40.150
we most maker that misfit finding missing sides in a right-angle triangle is one

191
00:08:40.151 --> 00:08:41.260
more thing that I wanted to show you.

192
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:45.760
I had this diagram happening before where these two dots are moving,

193
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.310
but you now know how I did it. I put those two lines on there,

194
00:08:48.311 --> 00:08:50.740
kind of the projection of that outer point,

195
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:53.860
the projection vertically and horizontally. Now, once I realized I can do that,

196
00:08:53.861 --> 00:08:57.390
I don't have to restrict it to two lines. I could put three lines on.

197
00:08:59.340 --> 00:08:59.670
<v 3>You get.</v>

198
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:04.080
<v 0>A really nice effect of these three points moving and they always dodgy each</v>

199
00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:06.840
other. They're moving in what they might call simple harmonic motion,

200
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.170
but then they're nicely sort of lined up. So they didn't have a hit each other.

201
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.110
I just really like this. So I'm going to crank up the number of lines.

202
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.183
Here we go.

203
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:24.440
<v 3>No.</v>

204
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.460
<v 0>What I love about this is that everybody can see the yellow circle and mind</v>

205
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:31.460
blown. The dots are in a circle, definitely, but nothing.

206
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:32.780
Nothing is moving in a circle.

207
00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.030
Each one of these dots is moving in a straight line.

208
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:39.260
So if I grab one with my finger, this one is just moving backwards,

209
00:09:39.261 --> 00:09:43.370
forwards in a sinusoidal motion. As for they call this, this wave-like motion,

210
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.290
but all of them, because they're lined up in a certain way,

211
00:09:45.291 --> 00:09:48.350
create this lovely illusion of a circle, rolling around the inside of the thing.

212
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.840
It's a program. This, you just need some knowledge of how to make a sign wave,

213
00:09:50.841 --> 00:09:53.600
to shift around each time. And it's just a really lovely optical illusion.

214
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:56.660
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

215
00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:00.650
<v 0>But burying the lead that's the best bit. Is that the best bit? Yeah,</v>

216
00:10:00.651 --> 00:10:03.440
that's the bit, that's the bit that's got no use. Um,

217
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.480
but then I'm a sucker for things they've got no use.

218
00:10:05.481 --> 00:10:07.340
The thing is that I love masks because it's beautiful.

219
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:09.350
It turns out it's also useful,

220
00:10:09.351 --> 00:10:12.350
but mathematicians usually do stuff cause it's nice. And then they're like,

221
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.540
Oh yeah, it's also useful, but I would've done it anyway.

222
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:21.740
<v 1>You make me wait for it. You know,</v>

223
00:10:21.741 --> 00:10:26.180
one of the things I love about brilliant aside from their like deep dive courses

224
00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:30.170
are their daily challenges. They remind me a bit of the morning crossword,

225
00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:33.530
a great way to kickstart your brain in the morning. In fact,

226
00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.490
why not test yourself, do a hundred of them in a hundred days,

227
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:39.590
all the questions and puzzles on brilliant,

228
00:10:39.591 --> 00:10:43.100
a carefully crafted to get the very best out of your mind.

229
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.660
They often include little moments of interaction like these cool sliders.

230
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:49.280
So here's a question.

231
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.290
Can this line be positioned to cut these five circles in

232
00:10:54.291 --> 00:10:59.270
half, both in terms of area and perimeter? What do you reckon?

233
00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:01.910
Where could you put it after you've had a go?

234
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:06.140
