00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.510
<v 0>So I'm going to tell you about something called matrix factorizations,</v>

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.280
but the story starts with something I've studied in, in middle school.

3
00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:12.200
And you probably did too. Do you remember, we, you, you thought about factoring,

4
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.450
so you could factor in things like X squared minus four.

5
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.680
And if you remember that X minus two, two is the square root of four.

6
00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:23.600
That's the point times X plus,

7
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.180
and then maybe a little later you are allowed to replace four by the square of

8
00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:32.810
another variable. So if you have X squared minus Y squared,

9
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.020
the same formula works because you have the square root of Y squared.

10
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.300
And thanks minus Y times X plus Y the advantage of that is you can plug

11
00:00:41.301 --> 00:00:44.870
in any numbers you like for X and Y. And this will always be true. Uh,

12
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.960
you can also ask about square roots of polynomials like that.

13
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.770
So if you had X squared plus two X,

14
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.250
Y plus Y squared, then you could not only factor it.

15
00:00:55.251 --> 00:00:56.510
You could find a square root.

16
00:00:56.511 --> 00:01:01.040
So it's the product of two things that are equal it's X plus Y squared,

17
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.110
but there were plenty of things you couldn't factor.

18
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.200
The simplest one is something like X squared,

19
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.280
plus three couldn't factor it because you couldn't find a square root of minus

20
00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:14.330
three, but if you put in complex numbers, then you can factor it.

21
00:01:14.331 --> 00:01:18.680
So if you enlarge the domain of things, you accept as a fact variation,

22
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.350
then suddenly it becomes possible to factor.

23
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.570
And that's the kind of old story in mathematics.

24
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.300
If you want to solve an equation, like even something simple,

25
00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:30.230
like three X minus one equals zero, can't solve that in integers.

26
00:01:30.231 --> 00:01:34.040
So you invent rational numbers, fractions, and then you suddenly can solve that.

27
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.940
X is a third,

28
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.560
or if you said three X plus one equals zero,

29
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.950
and you'd have to know about negative numbers too. And for awhile,

30
00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:47.150
negative numbers were sort of very strange things in mathematics and they got

31
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.350
ordinary and we are happy to use them. So this is a kind of old theme in there.

32
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.850
Mathematics. If you don't have enough tricks in your bag, put in a new trick,

33
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.930
the square root of minus one, well, I'll let you solve lots more equations.

34
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.190
Then you could have solved them before.

35
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.720
And that's a story that's gone on in mathematics since the Greek times, really,

36
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.080
and been very important and always as a kind of complaint that well,

37
00:02:09.081 --> 00:02:11.450
that isn't real. It isn't the same thing. You know,

38
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.140
if solve and get a negative number, what could that mean in reality,

39
00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:18.590
but people got over it and they discovered that negative numbers were just as

40
00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:22.040
useful as positive numbers, or they could represent different kinds of things.

41
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.040
It's almost that necessity is the mother of invention. That's right.

42
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.630
And nature somehow follows along. Or, I mean, nature was ahead of us there.

43
00:02:29.631 --> 00:02:32.450
I think so nature knew about complex numbers,

44
00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:34.820
but they didn't bother to tell us for a long time.

45
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.980
And then we needed them for something.

46
00:02:36.981 --> 00:02:40.760
And we realized that they were useful and they've, you know,

47
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.940
now are the basis of lots of physics and everything.

48
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.070
So they're really out there in nature,

49
00:02:46.071 --> 00:02:49.790
even though they're called imaginary or complex. So there's a,

50
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.350
another story like this, which comes up in the invention of quantum mechanics.

51
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.970
Paul Adrian Dereck was one of the great physicists to the 20th.

52
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.510
And he was involved in the beginnings of quantum mechanics. As he worked,

53
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:07.450
he realized he needed to solve a problem like this,

54
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:09.010
which didn't seem to have a solution.

55
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.540
And the problem was about a complicated looking formula differential operator,

56
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.980
minus C squared times the second derivative with respect to time,

57
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.970
plus the sum of the derivatives with respect to the spatial coordinates.

58
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.930
So these squared let's say D X squared plus D squared,

59
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.530
D Y squared plus D squared, DZ squared.

60
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.500
So Dereck wanted not to solve this equation.

61
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:36.160
This has an important differential operator, but he wanted a square root of it.

62
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.630
That's a sort of weird thing to want because there is no square root,

63
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.070
which is a differential operator written like this. And if you think about it,

64
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.550
you can change coordinates. I won't bother to go through the change.

65
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.020
You need complex numbers and things,

66
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.970
but this is just like the formula T squared plus X squared,

67
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.490
plus Y squared plus Z squared.

68
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.540
So direct knew right away that finding a square root of this complicated looking

69
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:04.960
thing is the same as finding a square root of, of this simpler looking thing.

70
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.830
It's got four terms, but you can't find a square root.

71
00:04:09.831 --> 00:04:12.820
You can't even find a factorization of it. In fact,

72
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:14.710
if you think about it for a moment, you don't see that.

73
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.810
So Dereck had to jump out of the realm of simple polynomials and

74
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:24.610
what he did was realized that you could factor this in a certain sense in

75
00:04:24.611 --> 00:04:26.890
terms of matrices. And in fact,

76
00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:30.910
he's famous for inventing matrix mechanics and quantum mechanics in quantum

77
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:34.900
mechanics. One way to represent a state is as a big matrix, in fact,

78
00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:39.250
an infinite matrix, but finite ones are already interesting enough.

79
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.463
<v 1>Professor.</v>

80
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.400
So I'd take it the tool that he's about to pull from the tool bag to get him out

81
00:04:44.401 --> 00:04:49.050
of his jam and matrices, but he didn't invent matrices. They were already known.

82
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.830
<v 0>Just,</v>

83
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.190
these were a big deal already in the 19th century when they were used for other

84
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.380
mathematical purposes. And they're used in all kinds of ways today,

85
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.250
they're everywhere in mathematics and physics and in all the applications of

86
00:05:02.251 --> 00:05:05.400
mathematics. So this was brand new idea that direct head,

87
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.210
and it's an idea that's had legs and I'll tell you,

88
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.240
so how did he do it first? I have to remind you how,

89
00:05:12.241 --> 00:05:14.730
what would it even mean to factor something in matrix?

90
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.260
You've got to multiply things to factor, right? So how do we multiply matrices?

91
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.930
Let me remind you. I'll do it with two by two matrix.

92
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.760
So suppose you have two matrices,

93
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.450
they could be matrices of numbers or matrices of polynomials,

94
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.900
and let's call the other one, a prime B prime,

95
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.340
C prime D prime matrix, of course,

96
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.620
is just an array of variables and where you're going to multiply them only when

97
00:05:37.621 --> 00:05:39.930
they're square matrices of the same size.

98
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.980
So you do this by taking the rows of the first matrix and multiplying them by

99
00:05:43.981 --> 00:05:46.530
the columns of the second matrix. So for example,

100
00:05:46.531 --> 00:05:50.760
the upper corner of the product matrix is going to be gotten by taking the first

101
00:05:50.761 --> 00:05:52.770
row of the first matrix in the first column.

102
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.760
So it's a times a prime plus B times C prime,

103
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.800
and then I'm going to do the same thing for the second entry on the top,

104
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.100
a B prime plus B D prime. And then on the bottom,

105
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:06.530
I'll use the bottom row of the first matrix,

106
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.510
a prime C plus C prime D and then finally

107
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.280
B prime, C plus D prime D. So that's a formula, it's a formula like any other,

108
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.000
the good thing about it is it has lots of the properties that ordinary

109
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:21.140
multiplication has,

110
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.980
but one property it doesn't have is that if you take matrices in the other

111
00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:28.250
order, you don't get the same answer. They don't commute.

112
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.610
And that's because we use the rows of this matrix and the columns of that

113
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:34.360
matrix. So it's obvious that there's no reason why they should commute.

114
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.210
And in fact, they don't directs idea was first of all,

115
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:41.510
to factor this polynomial in terms of matrices,

116
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.820
I'm going to do a slightly simpler looking example,

117
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:46.850
but those of you who know about complex numbers will know that it's the same

118
00:06:46.851 --> 00:06:51.440
example written in a different way. X, Y minus U V.

119
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.440
That's another falling Romeo in four variables, but it's it.

120
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.080
You can transform this into this with complex numbers.

121
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.430
And so how would you factor that in matrices? Well, here's the answer.

122
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.320
I'll just write it down. It's X,

123
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:08.180
Y U V times

124
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:13.040
Y X here and minus U and minus V

125
00:07:13.041 --> 00:07:13.730
here.

126
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.510
So this is a formula that some people in the audience will surely recognize,

127
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.290
and it's a spray simple one. Direct, certainly knew it and knew how to use it.

128
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.810
Here's a polynomial on the left and a matrix on the right.

129
00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:27.590
So what could that mean? Well, so this equality is wrong,

130
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:31.940
but what's true is that this is a diagonal matrix, X,

131
00:07:31.941 --> 00:07:34.160
Y minus UV,

132
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:39.950
and then zero and zero and X, Y minus UV.

133
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.030
And I think of this as X,

134
00:07:44.031 --> 00:07:48.860
Y minus UV of polynomial multiplied by the matrix,

135
00:07:48.861 --> 00:07:52.460
which looks like one. You know, if you multiply something by one,

136
00:07:52.461 --> 00:07:55.040
you get the same thing back in ordinary arithmetic.

137
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:59.690
So this is like the polynomial X, Y minus UV.

138
00:07:59.691 --> 00:08:03.140
And that's the sense in which this is a matrix factorization,

139
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.360
and I can even do this with the,

140
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:09.560
getting a square root by another simple trick that Dirac also probably knew in

141
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:12.230
advance, which is what he really wanted, which is what he wanted.

142
00:08:12.231 --> 00:08:14.210
He wanted the square root of the spelling Romeo.

143
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.170
So this requires a bigger matrices, no problem.

144
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:22.070
So let's call this matrix a and this matrix and B,

145
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.840
and then I'll make a bigger matrix by taking zero a,

146
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.650
this is now going to be a four by four, matrix B zero,

147
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.380
and multiplying it by the same thing,

148
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:38.870
zero a B zero. So that's the square of the matrix,

149
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:43.880
zero B zero squared. And that's equal to X,

150
00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:48.560
Y minus UV times a bigger matrix. One,

151
00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:52.340
one, one, one on the diagonal still it's an identity matrix.

152
00:08:52.341 --> 00:08:54.980
So this counts indirects book as a square.

153
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.110
<v 1>Because you can square root cause you can.</v>

154
00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.070
<v 0>So as you can you square a matrix and you get something,</v>

155
00:09:01.071 --> 00:09:05.690
which is the personification and matrices of this polynomial direct was

156
00:09:05.691 --> 00:09:09.590
satisfied with this. It served his purpose. He invented matrix mechanics,

157
00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.920
quantum mechanics, peacefully went on. And that,

158
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.080
that was the sort of the end of the story.

159
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.513
<v 1>That's the question, though.</v>

160
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.610
It feels a bit like you've changed sports mid game though.

161
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:23.210
Like it's like you started playing baseball and then by the end you were playing

162
00:09:23.211 --> 00:09:26.150
football cause you were using matrices, but so,

163
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.770
so have you not lost any meaning or usefulness by the way, that change of games.

164
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:35.180
<v 0>Surprisingly not. This is another case where nature was ahead of us.</v>

165
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.790
And nature said, well, really,

166
00:09:37.791 --> 00:09:42.560
you should be working with matrices to begin with. And you just found that out.

167
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.380
So direct was happy. And as I say,

168
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:49.910
quantum mechanics is based on this idea of extending the domain of thought in

169
00:09:49.911 --> 00:09:51.710
order to get some better results.

170
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.320
<v 1>Where's it going since you've, you've been playing with it?</v>

171
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:59.030
<v 0>Yeah, actually I wrote a paper on this subject.</v>

172
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.640
It's actually become my most quoted paper.

173
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:06.590
And I'll tell you why that is to the title of the paper is homological algebra

174
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:09.980
uncomplete intersections. It doesn't seem to have anything to do with this,

175
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.540
but it contains the theorem, which is a nice one,

176
00:10:14.541 --> 00:10:19.460
which says essentially that you can factor any polynomial that even seemed

177
00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.850
plausibly factor level in terms of matrices.

178
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.790
And if you don't exclude a sort of stupid idea,

179
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:27.890
then that becomes a trivial statement.

180
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:32.090
So of course you can factor any polynomial or anything in the world.

181
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:37.280
You can say F is equal to one times F that's

182
00:10:37.281 --> 00:10:40.430
not an interesting factorization. You didn't learn anything from that.

183
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:44.030
And that's not the kind of factorizations we were doing before.

184
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:49.430
So I want to exclude polynomials and matrices that have ones in the

185
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.720
word numbers in them, and only look at things with her.

186
00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.020
Paloma is of higher degree.

187
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.950
Then I can't factor the polynomial X it's a degree one.

188
00:10:57.951 --> 00:11:00.740
And if you multiply Palomas with degree three and four,

189
00:11:00.741 --> 00:11:03.890
you get upon them as degree seven. There's nothing you can do about it.

190
00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:07.220
You can't factor X plus Y squared either for the same reason,

191
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:11.030
because you can't find things that multiply the X. So you have to exclude that.

192
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:15.770
So the theorem I proved is that any polynomial with no

193
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.010
constant or linear term linear means degree,

194
00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:23.990
one can be factored as a product of

195
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.250
matrices with no constant terms,

196
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.170
no numbers in them. In other words.

197
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:34.060
<v 1>Can you show me a few examples of, yes, I can do that one. No,</v>

198
00:11:34.061 --> 00:11:35.450
I can't do that one. Right?

199
00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:37.310
<v 0>Tell me a polynomial, right?</v>

200
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:42.590
Pikes cubed us 79 Y squared

201
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.460
plus 34 X, Z.

202
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:50.780
Plus you just, anything? It doesn't matter. So I could,

203
00:11:50.781 --> 00:11:54.640
and I can write down an algorithm which would produce matrix factorization of

204
00:11:54.641 --> 00:11:56.950
whatever you want, or the machine will do it.

205
00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:59.170
<v 1>For me. Can you show me one? You can't do.</v>

206
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:02.500
<v 0>So you can't do X plus Y squared.</v>

207
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.290
You can't do X plus anything,

208
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:08.050
but that's basically the only things you can do.

209
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:13.170
<v 1>It sounds to me like you can't do a polynomial. If it has a variable,</v>

210
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.760
like an X in it that isn't multiplied by another variable and is a power.

211
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:21.360
<v 0>Right. It isn't multiplied by itself or another variable. Right.</v>

212
00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.100
So very volatile. Okay.

213
00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:27.360
<v 1>So the reason the X was okay here is because it was multiplied by a C, right?</v>

214
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:28.320
That's right. Okay.

215
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:33.150
<v 0>So actually the theorem applies to power series and lots of other things too.</v>

216
00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:38.670
And the, the restriction of not having a linear term or a constant term

217
00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:43.410
has a different interpretation in power series, which is more natural in a way.

218
00:12:43.411 --> 00:12:45.840
So this is, this is a true statement,

219
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.930
but it's not the most natural statement from a mathematician.

220
00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:50.970
<v 1>Direct, not saying that or good.</v>

221
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:54.630
<v 0>Question. I don't, and of course I can't ask him, I don't know the answer.</v>

222
00:12:54.631 --> 00:12:58.290
He's dead a long time already, but, uh,

223
00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:03.150
it proving this depends on a theory of finite free resolutions in

224
00:13:03.151 --> 00:13:06.030
which I'm an expert and have thought about a lot.

225
00:13:06.031 --> 00:13:10.650
And I actually got to it by proving something different in that

226
00:13:10.651 --> 00:13:11.484
theory.

227
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:16.410
So I proved that if you take a polynomial ring and factor

228
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.210
out upon an oatmeal,

229
00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:23.730
then every free resolution becomes periodic of period

230
00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:28.620
two. And the period two part really comes from a matrix factorization of that

231
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:33.600
polynomial. So thanks algorithmic way of producing the matrix factorization.

232
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.320
And there's more to it than that, of course, but that's the,

233
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.850
that was how I got to it.

234
00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.520
<v 1>Why is it your most cited paper? So.</v>

235
00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.820
<v 0>It was, uh, it was already a nice paper.</v>

236
00:13:44.821 --> 00:13:49.650
I was very proud of it at the time I did it and people used it for this and that

237
00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:53.550
it has something to do with a subject called Cohen Macaulay modules, um,

238
00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:55.980
and representations of finite groups. So it,

239
00:13:56.070 --> 00:14:00.990
it got out in the literature was used, but then in 2004,

240
00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:05.880
a physicist discovered that he needed this general theorem

241
00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:11.040
for the purpose of, uh, defining boundary conditions in string theory.

242
00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:14.130
And string theory, of course, is a big deal.

243
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.650
And physicists tend to cluster in groups,

244
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.460
working on things so soon there were hundreds of references to this.

245
00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:23.100
So that's why I became my most cited paper.

246
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.640
<v 1>Have you become a bit of an expert on string theory now? Like if you research,</v>

247
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:29.130
why they like it or have you just kind of said, all right,

248
00:14:29.131 --> 00:14:31.310
if it makes you happy, go ahead. I don't care.

249
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:36.510
<v 0>A mixture of the two, uh, actually a collaborator of mine, Irena paver.</v>

250
00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.930
And I worked on a generalization of this and we thought, well,

251
00:14:39.931 --> 00:14:43.310
the string is to love this so much and maybe they'll love our generalization

252
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:44.820
too. That would be nice.

253
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.440
And so we talked to a bunch of physicists and they got them to give us days of

254
00:14:49.441 --> 00:14:53.510
explanation. And at the end I understood a little more than I had before,

255
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.910
but I certainly didn't become a physicist.

256
00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.810
I think that's a hard theory to get into if you're not steeped in,

257
00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.520
in field theory to begin with.

258
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:03.430
<v 1>What good does it, do you,</v>

259
00:15:03.431 --> 00:15:06.520
if a paper you wrote gets cited lots and lots of times.

260
00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.080
<v 0>Makes me pleased. That's all really, um, I,</v>

261
00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:15.430
I admit a stage of my career where it doesn't really matter to me in career

262
00:15:15.431 --> 00:15:18.610
terms at all. Uh, but it's,

263
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:21.130
it's nice to know that someone is using them. You know,

264
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.960
mathematics has a pretty small audience base, 80,

265
00:15:24.961 --> 00:15:28.900
your videos have vastly extended the audience space.

266
00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:33.970
But if I look at the colleagues who would be natural

267
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.440
candidates for using this theorem, it might be in the hundreds,

268
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:42.370
but it's not in the millions, certainly. Maybe it's not in the thousands.

269
00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.570
And so having more people interested in one's work, that feels good.

270
00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.030
<v 1>So citations a lot, your video views.</v>

271
00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.220
<v 0>That's right, exactly. Exactly.</v>

272
00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:53.560
<v 1>How many citations does it had? I.</v>

273
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.820
<v 0>Don't, I, I don't know. I haven't looked, um, my,</v>

274
00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:02.500
my book on community algebra has the most citations and that's in the thousands,

275
00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:06.400
but that's, that's a lot from any mathematical work.

276
00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:11.500
Here's a good compass ruler meant just a straight edge, no markings on his role.

277
00:16:11.501 --> 00:16:15.820
This one has markings, but I'm gonna use it anyway. I won't use the markings.

278
00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:20.680
Here's a nice circle, drawn with a compass and the old style. So one,

279
00:16:20.681 --> 00:16:25.270
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,

280
00:16:25.271 --> 00:16:28.390
15, 16, 17, 18,

281
00:16:28.391 --> 00:16:31.570
19 2021.

282
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:33.970
So I made a 21 gun by accident.
