00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:02.610
<v 0>It's called descending dungeon,</v>

2
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:09.380
Cow.

3
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.300
What is that number or would you like to guess you don't have a clue if you want

4
00:00:14.301 --> 00:00:19.010
to describe a moderately large number Brady you'd describe it as

5
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.370
writing a tower of numbers. For instance,

6
00:00:22.371 --> 00:00:25.970
you might write two to three to the four to the five,

7
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.550
and that's not a very big number, but it's big enough.

8
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.500
There is different ways to interpret it.

9
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.360
Do you mean two to the three to the four to the

10
00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:36.140
five?

11
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.940
Or do we mean two to the three to the four to the five like that?

12
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.160
So there are two different ways. Parenthesizes it?

13
00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:47.840
From the top down or from the bottom up. And if you do it from the bottom up,

14
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.470
the tower essentially collapses two cubed is eight.

15
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.140
So we would have eight to the fourth to the fifth,

16
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.310
but eight to the fourth is two to the 12. And to the fifth,

17
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.870
this is two to the 60. So this is about 10 to the 18.

18
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.210
It's big, but it's not very big now. Whereas if we do it from the top down,

19
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.190
this is the official way to do it for one of the five is two to the

20
00:01:13.191 --> 00:01:15.590
10th, which is one Oh two, four.

21
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.770
So we have three to them,

22
00:01:18.771 --> 00:01:23.510
one over two for two to that power. Now, three to the one Oh two,

23
00:01:23.511 --> 00:01:28.490
four is pretty big. So this is two to the 10 to the four 89.

24
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.800
And that's a pretty big number.

25
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.950
So for InstaSizing from the top down,

26
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.460
that's the default in most computer languages. Okay.

27
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.840
So this gives you some pretty big numbers. On the other hand, my good friend,

28
00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:46.730
Mark, LeBron had an idea. He said, um, instead of having towers,

29
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.600
let's have Dungeons, let's go down. He says,

30
00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:54.140
we're going to use the following notation, which actually is in common use.

31
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.180
I'll let a sub B mean read a base

32
00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:01.430
B. And we do that all the time. For instance,

33
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.720
in binary notation seven is one, one, one.

34
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.060
So you would write one, one, one sub two, which means interpret one,

35
00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:15.110
one, one in base two is equal to seven in base 10.

36
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.550
And the way you read this, you say, all right, that one is a one.

37
00:02:19.551 --> 00:02:21.470
That one is a two. And that one is a four.

38
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.830
So this is four plus two plus one,

39
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.900
which is indeed seven. So that's the notation. Now,

40
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.310
if a had just one digit, it's kind of boring.

41
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.890
If we took three sub 17,

42
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.010
it's just three in 10 single digit numbers.

43
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.110
Don't change under this operation. So the first interesting number is 10,

44
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.770
and we're going to rebase it in base 11.

45
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.930
And we're going to rebase that in base 12 and rebase that in 13

46
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.100
and go for a while down to end steps and stop.

47
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.140
What do get, what are these numbers? Well, again,

48
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:04.300
you have to decide how to parenthesize it,

49
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.290
there are two ways from the top or from the bottom. And in this case,

50
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.330
parenthesizes it from the bottom up is the best 10, seven 11. For example,

51
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:16.030
just to get started. What does 10 sub 11? Well,

52
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.680
that one means 11 and that zero means you've got zero digits.

53
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.030
So it's 11. Okay. What about tens of 11 sub 12?

54
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.390
What we're going to parenthesize from the bottom up.

55
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.040
So that's 10 now, 11 rebased to base 12.

56
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.790
That one means 12. And that one means one. So 12 plus one is 13.

57
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.040
So that's 10 sub 13. That tends to be 13. That one means 13.

58
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.000
And that zero means you don't have any more digits to add. Okay.

59
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.740
Now what about tens of 11 sub 12, seven, 13. And again,

60
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:54.820
we put in the Perkins. Well, so it's 10 sub 11,

61
00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:59.080
12 sub 13. What's that? That one is 13 plus two.

62
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.600
Um, uh, dollars is 15. So that's 1115,

63
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.530
but now what is 11 sub 15? Well,

64
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.640
that one is a 15 is worth $15. That one is worth $1.

65
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.990
So that's 16 and 10 sub 16 is 16.

66
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.760
So the sequence that we getting starts with 10, and then we get 11,

67
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.150
13 and 16. Let's do another one.

68
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.680
So 10 sub 11, 12, 13, 14,

69
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.810
13. So 14 is 14 plus three. It's 17.

70
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.213
Okay.

71
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.480
12 sub 17 is 17.

72
00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:41.920
Plus two is 19.

73
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.780
Now we have 11 sub 19,

74
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.480
11 of 19. That one is 19.

75
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.710
That one is makes 20. So that's 20.

76
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.690
And then we have 10 sub 20, which is equal to 20.

77
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.090
So the next term in the sequence is 20 and we keep going.

78
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.660
And the question is, how big do these numbers grow? Well,

79
00:05:07.661 --> 00:05:09.820
we could also have parenthesized it.

80
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.410
Let me show you what it looks like if we do it the other way round from top

81
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.210
down 10, and then we have 10 sub 11. Well, that's 11 again.

82
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.060
Now we have tens of 11 sub 12,

83
00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:25.240
but I'm going to put the parentheses around the top two. So 10,

84
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.800
so 11 is 11, 11 sub 12 is,

85
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.140
um, 13, again, same as it was here. 10, 11,

86
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.430
12 subs, 13 with Perrins likes this.

87
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.360
So this is equal to 11 sub 12,

88
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.110
which is 13, some 13.

89
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.550
That one means $13. That three means three single dollars.

90
00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:54.220
So we get 60. Well, that's what we got before,

91
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.830
but soon hits can change.

92
00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.230
If we parenthesize these Dungeons from the bottom up,

93
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.330
we get one sequence, 10, 11, 13, 16, 20,

94
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.480
and then the next one is 25. After 25,

95
00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:11.570
we get 31 38 and 46 and so on.

96
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.430
And then it slowly increases as you can see. And after a while,

97
00:06:16.431 --> 00:06:18.320
it starts to get bigger and bigger and bigger.

98
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.740
And after we've gone to a hundred or so steps,

99
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:26.210
we're starting to get some pretty big numbers. Whereas on the other hand,

100
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.690
if we print InstaSize from the top down, we get much,

101
00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:33.110
much bigger numbers very quickly from the top down,

102
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.060
it grows really quickly. Yeah. Okay. We get the sequence 10, 11, 13, 20,

103
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.380
so far as degrees, but then we get 30, 48,

104
00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:46.370
76, 132, 420. And so on.

105
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.760
And after a mere 30 steps,

106
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.970
we're getting gigantic numbers as you can see here.

107
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.000
So that's the second sequence. Where are you taking this next? Well,

108
00:06:56.001 --> 00:06:58.730
I want to give you two more, which is the other way,

109
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:03.110
natural way to make a dungeon. If you give me a bit of paper,

110
00:07:03.111 --> 00:07:04.850
I'll show you in this sequence,

111
00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:08.660
we're going to start with 10 and then we'll do 11 sub 10,

112
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.890
12 sub 11, sub 10, 13 sub 12, seven, 11 sub 10,

113
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.610
and so on. And again, we have to decide which way to parenthesize it.

114
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.090
And the preferred way is from the bottom up.

115
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.990
So 11 sub 10 is that one means $10.

116
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.780
And that one means one more dollar. So this is a level.

117
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.670
So now we're going to do a 12 sub 11 sub 10. Now 11 sub 10,

118
00:07:31.671 --> 00:07:36.260
as we just saw is 11. So what we have is 12 sub 11, 12, seven,

119
00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:40.900
11 is 11 plus two, which is 13. So,

120
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.400
so the sequences goes 10, 11, 13.

121
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:48.650
Now we have to do 13 sub 12 sub 11 subtext. Okay.

122
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.430
13 sub 13, by what we just did.

123
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.400
And that's 13 plus three is 60.

124
00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:01.310
And that is obviously by what we just did. 14 sub 16,

125
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.320
which is 20. Now.

126
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.600
<v 2>We will do one more, 15.</v>

127
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.350
<v 0>14, 13, 12, 11, 10.</v>

128
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:14.840
By what we know from the previous little calculation is 15 sub

129
00:08:14.841 --> 00:08:18.500
20, but that one means $20 and add $5.

130
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:23.570
So that's $25. Okay. So that's, that's from the bottom up.

131
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.920
If we do it from the top down, we'll get a different sequence.

132
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.460
This was pretty easy because we didn't have to recalculate everything.

133
00:08:31.461 --> 00:08:35.000
Each time we could just use what we knew from the previous step,

134
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:39.380
from the difficulty with top-down is that you have to redo the computation at

135
00:08:39.381 --> 00:08:43.790
each step. That's why the other one is preferred. All right.

136
00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:48.590
So 11 sub 10 is certainly 11. Now we have a 12 sub 11 sub 10.

137
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.850
Now 12 sub 11 is 13.

138
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.880
So this is 13 sub 10, which is 13.

139
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:01.170
And you can see that it's the same. So far, we are 10, 11, 13,

140
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.290
13, 12, 11,

141
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:09.240
10 is equal to parenthesized from the top

142
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:14.340
down 13 sub 12 is 12 plus three is 15,

143
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:19.110
15, so 11 is 16. So,

144
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.780
and then 16 sub 10 is 16.

145
00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:26.670
Still the same as we had before 14, 13, 12, 11,

146
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.530
10, 14, 13 is 17. 17,

147
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.120
12 is 19, 19 seven.

148
00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:40.830
11 is equal to 2020 sub

149
00:09:40.831 --> 00:09:45.630
10 is 20 Holy cow. All right,

150
00:09:45.631 --> 00:09:46.800
we'll go. One more step.

151
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.350
<v 3>Breaking from the pack. Now we've got a different secret.</v>

152
00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:58.260
<v 4>And this again, presumably the same thing will happen here, but the one.</v>

153
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.850
<v 0>It's the same. I have the same pictures as I showed you. Okay?</v>

154
00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:06.170
So now we've got four sequences for InstaSize from the top down from the bottom

155
00:10:06.171 --> 00:10:08.750
up. Yes. The question is, how big are these now?

156
00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:13.880
What happens if you go down a dungeon and steps down towards the

157
00:10:13.881 --> 00:10:17.570
basement? What, how big is the number? If you have a number,

158
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.020
you take its logarithm. It's much smaller than it.

159
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:24.830
If you take the log of the log as the number, it gets really tiny.

160
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.560
And if you take the log as the log is the log,

161
00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.830
it has to be a pretty big number before you get anything.

162
00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:35.300
There's anything that's left after you take logs. So with a tower,

163
00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:36.980
a tower of height,

164
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.960
N you have to take logs and minus one times to bring it down

165
00:10:41.961 --> 00:10:45.560
to earth. But these Dungeons, they don't grow that fast,

166
00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.030
which is really surprising.

167
00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:52.250
What you get is that you only have to take logs twice before you get a number.

168
00:10:52.251 --> 00:10:53.120
You can see.

169
00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.970
<v 4>But some of those numbers you showed me like after you've done,</v>

170
00:10:55.971 --> 00:10:58.910
hundreds of steps were massive, logging them twice.

171
00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.030
Wouldn't bring you down to a reasonable.

172
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.200
<v 0>Yes, it does. Um, this is our some tonically yeah.</v>

173
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.350
Um, a hundred steps. We got a number that,

174
00:11:09.351 --> 00:11:13.880
that was that big tend to they're 80. If we were taking logs to the base,

175
00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:16.850
10 of a number like 10 to the 80 10 to the power,

176
00:11:16.851 --> 00:11:21.560
80 take logs becomes 80 times. Log of 10, call it 80,

177
00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:26.390
take the log again. Log of 80 is just under two.

178
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.820
So it drops down very quickly.

179
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.640
<v 4>But I'm not surprised it has a different behavior because you're doing a</v>

180
00:11:31.641 --> 00:11:34.730
completely different operation with the towers.

181
00:11:34.731 --> 00:11:36.680
You were like multiplying numbers,

182
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.490
but this operation you were doing with the Dungeons involved,

183
00:11:40.491 --> 00:11:45.350
like converting numbers into faces and things that was a whole different game

184
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:46.303
you were playing. Yeah.

185
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:47.990
<v 0>You're absolutely right. Brady.</v>

186
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.700
I may be was exaggerating a bit. Yes.

187
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:56.800
I mean, they do grow very quickly and it is surprising when you work them out.

188
00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.790
You sort of those, those how rapidly they grow those numbers.

189
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.920
See them initially, we thought that they would grow just like towers.

190
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.930
So it was really a surprise to find out that they don't one really nice

191
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:14.290
example. We've been talking about the notation, Acer B,

192
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.700
which means take the number a and read it as if it was written in base B.

193
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:23.800
What if you took a and read it in base a and read

194
00:12:23.801 --> 00:12:28.780
that in base say, and you went all the way to infinity.

195
00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:34.720
And in particular, I want to take a, to be the number 1.1.

196
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.430
We'd like to thank brilliant for supporting this video.

197
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.520
Brilliant is a huge archive of puzzles,

198
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.000
quizzes courses, including the course,

199
00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.740
as you're seeing on the screen at the moment.

And these are just a selection of them. There are more all the time,

201
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.800
obviously being bit of a number file. The number theory.

202
00:12:55.801 --> 00:12:59.010
One is one of my favorites. This is just a little tiny,

203
00:12:59.011 --> 00:13:02.580
tiny taste of what it looks like. If you're trying to get your body in shape,

204
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:05.760
you're probably going to join a gym. You might even get a personal trainer.

205
00:13:05.761 --> 00:13:09.000

Thanks to brilliant for supporting this episode.

214
00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.150
Five means five over 10,

215
00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:42.480
the six means six over 10 squared.

216
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:47.400
If we take 1.1 sub itself forever.
