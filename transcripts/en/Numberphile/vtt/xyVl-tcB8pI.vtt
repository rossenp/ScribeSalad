00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.210
<v 0>I want to draw a square. I would like to, I've got some Dotty paper on,</v>

2
00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:06.570
on the Brown paper here, so I can draw stuff on these dots.

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.650
I'm going to draw a square,

4
00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:09.180
but I'd like you to tell me how big a square to draw.

5
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.680
<v 1>Uh, let's do, uh, like a four by four.</v>

6
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.960
<v 0>So you called it a four by four.</v>

7
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.010
How big is that square in terms of area and not a trick question and just

8
00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:19.844
curious.

9
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.310
<v 1>Oops. 16 units, 16.</v>

10
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.780
<v 0>Units. So it is possible to draw a square of so 16. And I want to say size,</v>

11
00:00:26.781 --> 00:00:29.660
I'm going to talk about area from now on, uh, 16 units.

12
00:00:29.661 --> 00:00:31.730
What other squares are possible to draw on this grid?

13
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.730
And the rule is I've got to use the dots and straight lines between dots.

14
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.830
I don't think this is a trick question,

15
00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:38.630
but can you suggest another square size I could draw?

16
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.420
<v 1>Well, you could do like a two by two.</v>

17
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.790
<v 0>Every four. Yeah. So we do four. We can do 16 obvious ones, a one,</v>

18
00:00:46.791 --> 00:00:50.450
a one window, one. Uh, do you see the sort of numbers where we're getting here?

19
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.810
Always square. Now we're getting square numbers because we're drawing squares.

20
00:00:53.811 --> 00:00:56.420
And first of all, that's not a surprise. The naming is a good thing here.

21
00:00:56.421 --> 00:01:00.380
So I could draw a one, a four. I could do a nine. We didn't do that.

22
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.520
It's not a surprise that you can draw a square number, size squares.

23
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.750
Can you draw a square or could it could one draw a square on this grid using the

24
00:01:08.751 --> 00:01:11.240
same rules during the dots? There's not a square.

25
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.670
<v 1>Like diagonals or something. Oh.</v>

26
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.490
<v 0>Slightly squares that are allowed. As long as we stick to the dots,</v>

27
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.360
let's try one. Um, I'd like you to tell me I'm going to start at this dot.

28
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.700
I won't go along the vertical or horizontal though.

29
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.720
So w where do you want me to go?

30
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.760
I can go a certain amount down a certain amount of long.

31
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.860
<v 1>Four down.</v>

32
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.720
<v 0>To three. Ah, so four down here and an angle.</v>

33
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.940
<v 1>And go across to cross to.</v>

34
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.300
<v 0>If that's the side of the square, I better do this one sort of for long. So we,</v>

35
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.490
it was definitely a square.

36
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.120
And you asked me to go sort of four down and too long,

37
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.600
which means all of the triangles like that. So there's a two, there's a four,

38
00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:52.040
there's a sort of, so maybe we call it the two, four square and what's his area.

39
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.620
I don't think this is much less obvious to me now,

40
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.620
but it's not too hard to work out. There are many ways you could do it.

41
00:01:57.621 --> 00:01:59.660
You can chop it into bits and work out the area of the beds.

42
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.330
Or you can look at the area of the big square,

43
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.270
which I think is six by six.

44
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.990
So 36 and take away the four triangles.

45
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.130
So I think he's trying to two by four, let's call it half times, two times four,

46
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.570
which means it's one times four, which means four. And here all together,

47
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.260
four times four is 16. So I think this is area 20 good.

48
00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:24.470
So we've drawn squares on the grid that are not just the square numbers.

49
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.880
So I guess the natural question, it's a pretty elementary starting point.

50
00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:33.110
What squares can you draw? We can definitely do square numbers.

51
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.000
We can definitely do the number 20. Could we, for example, work our way up,

52
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:40.970
we can do one. Can we do two tens out two is really easy.

53
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.110
You can see that each two triangles makes one. So this is area two,

54
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.170
and you do the same trick with the outside square, realize that's area four.

55
00:02:48.171 --> 00:02:50.150
And you've got to have that anyway. Can you do three?

56
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.710
This is suddenly not obvious.

57
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.430
And you start drawing stuff and ends up being very hard to draw three.

58
00:02:55.431 --> 00:02:57.530
At least even if it's possible, it's not easy to do.

59
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.880
And I think you can then convince quite quickly that it can't be done,

60
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.850
but we know we can do, can we do five? Let's try it.

61
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.580
It can't be a vertical horizontal one.

62
00:03:08.581 --> 00:03:10.500
So we're going to have to go a bit of a slanty thing.

63
00:03:10.501 --> 00:03:13.530
And if I go to down a one along, so the Square's going to look,

64
00:03:13.531 --> 00:03:16.320
let's give myself some space that sort of diagonal,

65
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.640
which you can see is like a two and a one sort of vector. So the other side,

66
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:21.570
it was going to do that.

67
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.300
And that as long as I do a two and a one on each vector,

68
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.350
I'm pretty sure that's five. Then I enjoy the, the thing around it,

69
00:03:28.351 --> 00:03:31.980
which is now nine, because it's three by three. And these triangles,

70
00:03:31.981 --> 00:03:34.980
if I calculate them, let's do it. This is two and a one.

71
00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:39.570
So the area of one, the whole thing is nine. The four triangles,

72
00:03:39.571 --> 00:03:43.710
give me four. So this is very fine. Okay. So there's the problem.

73
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.960
The problem is even if you allow slanty squares,

74
00:03:45.961 --> 00:03:49.890
which was your genius idea to door, to the square numbers, some of you can do,

75
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.780
you can do five and you do 20. You can do 10, but you can't do three.

76
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.980
The question I want to investigate in this video, which squares can you draw?

77
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.060
Um, is there a shortcut of finding what the areas that you could get?

78
00:04:03.061 --> 00:04:05.430
So 20 took us a little bit of calculation with some triangles.

79
00:04:05.431 --> 00:04:08.400
The five took us a bit, but I did. I used some other notations.

80
00:04:08.401 --> 00:04:13.170
There's this two foreigners notation that when we're 20 and the two,

81
00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:17.670
one notation from the five. And if we use the same notation,

82
00:04:17.671 --> 00:04:20.220
this could be kind of like for zero notation,

83
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.970
because for every side you go along four and down zero,

84
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.850
I could write down all the lists of notation I could do. I could do one, one,

85
00:04:26.851 --> 00:04:29.790
one, two, one, three, one, four, and I could just check all the lists.

86
00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:32.370
And I could find pretty easily just by a search of all the numbers.

87
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.480
And they realized there were some missing. So three is missing. Six is missing.

88
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.680
Seven is missing. 11 is missing and already we're at a sequence.

89
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.550
I'm like an all prime. One of them is perfect. Yeah.

90
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.070
Like what's going on? I don't,

91
00:04:46.071 --> 00:04:48.630
I really don't think it's obvious before we go any further though,

92
00:04:48.631 --> 00:04:51.360
what would it be nice if first of all, we can find a shortcut for,

93
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.820
instead of having to draw a thing and count all the triangles,

94
00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:57.390
how can I just write down the notation for the sort of slanting this and get

95
00:04:57.391 --> 00:04:58.430
straight to the area I've,

96
00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:02.220
I've seen this act activity done with sort of a nine year old school students,

97
00:05:02.221 --> 00:05:03.960
and they're busy drawing squares and calculate it.

98
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:04.920
And they were having a lovely time,

99
00:05:04.921 --> 00:05:08.730
but suddenly there's this deep glimpse of maths that goes way beyond what

100
00:05:08.731 --> 00:05:11.670
they're ready for. Um, but what they are ready for is,

101
00:05:11.671 --> 00:05:15.420
is finding a quicker way to do some area. So let me draw a general for you.

102
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.210
A slanty square is going to fit inside another square.

103
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.770
If I say that this distance is a, and this one is B,

104
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.780
then we've kind of got this. This is like our,

105
00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:27.480
a B notation that we had you were describing earlier.

106
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.120
So my challenge is then how big is the square in the middle?

107
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.580
Cause that's the bit we can draw and it's not too bad.

108
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.100
I can work out the side of the big square.

109
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.450
Do you want to suggest how long that is? It's always going to be a plus. Yeah,

110
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.620
because there's the symmetry,

111
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.270
there's these triangles turn up all the way around.

112
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.740
So the whole square is a plus B squared. Happy with that.

113
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.120
What about the triangles?

114
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.240
Cause that was a way we did it before we can take away the triangles from that

115
00:05:51.241 --> 00:05:53.130
and we'll get the area of this central bit.

116
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.160
And I think the triangle is relatively obvious is a and a B.

117
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.640
And there's a right-angle because the whole thing's a square.

118
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.440
So half of a times B. So if I subtract a four of them, four,

119
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:05.810
lots of a half a times B, right?

120
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:08.870
So that's the area where we're we're after we need to do some algebra.

121
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:12.680
So brace yourselves, I'm going to square this bracket. Uh, A-plus B plus B.

122
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:14.810
Let's just, just do the long way round to make sure we don't mess it up. Uh,

123
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.590
this is going to be a squared. We're going to get an a times a B, and again,

124
00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:22.040
it'd be times and AYSO, but two lots of a B, and I'm going to get a B squared.

125
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.970
Uh, this will realize becomes two AB and actually,

126
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.520
I mean, this is a familiar bit of algebra, perhaps,

127
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.200
according to the calculation, though, uh, if you have an AB slant notation,

128
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.930
the area of this square is a squared plus B squared.

129
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.570
I suspect something familiar as a character loss.

130
00:06:41.571 --> 00:06:43.550
People watching this video might be occurring to you as well,

131
00:06:43.551 --> 00:06:44.750
but let's just check. It works.

132
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.310
The two for notation should give us 20 a square two,

133
00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:54.080
you get four square four, you get 16. Add them together. 20, the two,

134
00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:57.080
one notation square two, you get four square one. You get one added together.

135
00:06:57.081 --> 00:06:58.460
You get five. It seems to work.

136
00:06:58.461 --> 00:07:01.580
And it obviously works on the ones with zeros because fourth grade is 16.

137
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.320
<v 2>No she's gone. Have you noticed what we just proved?</v>

138
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:08.381
<v 0>I mean,</v>

139
00:07:08.381 --> 00:07:13.240
if I put a C here and I talk about a right-angle triangle with size a B and C,

140
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.730
I'm saying the square on C.

141
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.950
<v 2>We just proved by figures. Wow.</v>

142
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:20.330
<v 0>It's one of my favorite proofs by Faygo,</v>

143
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.030
as it turns out in a way of playing with squares on a Dottie grid,

144
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.510
you ended up proving one of those facts of geometry that everybody knows.

145
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.850
There's literally hundreds of proofs for, but here's my favorite one.

146
00:07:27.851 --> 00:07:30.040
And it kind of arises organically. I have a problem.

147
00:07:30.041 --> 00:07:32.530
We were doing something else anyway. So bonus along the way,

148
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.240
we've proved by digress. We've now got shortcut.

149
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.450
If you've got an AB slanty square, a squared plus B squared,

150
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.660
which means the real question we're on now, which is for me,

151
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.330
which squares can you draw? And which ones can't you draw?

152
00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.240
It becomes a number theory question, forget geometry.

153
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.840
It becomes which numbers can you make by adding two squares together,

154
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:54.490
we introduce the sum of two squares and the nine-year-olds I saw tackling this

155
00:07:54.491 --> 00:07:57.520
problem. Don't make a lot of progress for this, because this is,

156
00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.320
this is a classic piece of number theory.

157
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.170
There's out there in degree level undergraduate courses,

158
00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:04.090
and I'm not going to solve it for you,

159
00:08:04.091 --> 00:08:07.390
but let me write down at the beginning of the list of the squares that you can't

160
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.673
draw,

161
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:12.400
you can't draw three because there are no two numbers you can square to get

162
00:08:12.401 --> 00:08:14.140
through. And if you try on the grid,

163
00:08:14.141 --> 00:08:15.970
you end up drawing off the squares and very quickly,

164
00:08:15.971 --> 00:08:19.300
or you've exhausted all the possibilities and all the answers you're getting

165
00:08:19.301 --> 00:08:20.980
after that are bigger than three. So, you know,

166
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.470
the three is never going to turn up, so it can be done by exhaustion.

167
00:08:23.471 --> 00:08:26.920
You just keep trying, you can't do six, you can't do seven. You can't do 11.

168
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.650
In fact, because it's an exhaustion thing,

169
00:08:29.651 --> 00:08:32.860
you might as well do a computer program just to check sort of manually,

170
00:08:32.861 --> 00:08:34.000
which ones can and can't be done.

171
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.060
So I'm going to boot up a computer just to get the list.

172
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.000
So this list of numbers is weird.

173
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:45.310
I'm going to just write down a few more of them. 12 is in there, 1450,

174
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:49.090
and you get a little run them consecutive there. Then it jumps in 1921.

175
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.840
That's enough for now these numbers, you cannot draw squares on Dotty paper.

176
00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.160
Do they become more sparse or less pass as you go.

177
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.330
<v 1>Up? I wonder.</v>

178
00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.840
<v 0>I I'm. Well out of my depth there, the thing is,</v>

179
00:08:59.841 --> 00:09:02.210
and what's what was started as a simple problem.

180
00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:03.680
Like I quickly get out of my depth.

181
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.620
This isn't a number theory question out of which numbers can be made as the sum

182
00:09:06.621 --> 00:09:09.590
of two squares. And I have no intuition about it. Um,

183
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.260
what happened was I went and looked it up. I went and looked up,

184
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:14.060
which numbers can be the sum of two squares.

185
00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.540
And it's a classic number theory problem that you'd do an undergraduate degree

186
00:09:17.541 --> 00:09:18.860
in mathematics. And it turns out there's a,

187
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:23.330
there's a simple test which numbers can be made as the sum of two squares.

188
00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:25.970
Do you want to know the test or do you, uh, do you want.

189
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:27.950
<v 1>To get, I definitely want to know.</v>

190
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:33.560
<v 0>If a number has a prime factor of the form 4k plus the rate</v>

191
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:37.940
to an odd power. It can't be done. Sorry, say that again.

192
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.750
I'll give you an example. The number 11, first of all,

193
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.730
this is prime one-line prime number.

194
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.190
<v 1>And it, so it only has one factor.</v>

195
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.900
<v 0>It only has one factor, which is itself in one,</v>

196
00:09:47.901 --> 00:09:52.640
but the fact is other than one is just itself and it's a prime of the form

197
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:56.120
4k plus 3d by which I mean it's four times something.

198
00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.930
And the three more equivalently is one less than the multiple of four. Um,

199
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.440
so you could say 4k minus one is kind of equivalent when you're going mod four,

200
00:10:03.441 --> 00:10:06.290
it just cycles around every four. So these are the same thing.

201
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.730
It turns out all primes,

202
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.810
except two are of the 4k plus three type or 4k plus one.

203
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.690
And these ones, the problem is so three is another example.

204
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.840
It's one less than a multiple, uh, 19 in fact, seven as well.

205
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.750
These are all one less than a multiple of four.

206
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.480
Maybe prime numbers are not surprising and sequences like this,

207
00:10:23.481 --> 00:10:25.790
but the six is what bothers people, because it's not prime.

208
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.210
It still can't be done. And that's because it has a factor of three,

209
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:34.550
six is three times two, in fact. And because it's has a factor of that form,

210
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.890
it can't be done before you get into it.

211
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.970
Nine has a factor of three is three squared.

212
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.070
So it has a factor of that form,

213
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.850
but because it's got two of them all play together fine.

214
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:52.100
<v 1>So that number, the power has to be on for it to be a killer.</v>

215
00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:56.180
<v 0>Exactly. So another killer one, let's pick one off the list. Uh, let's pick 12.</v>

216
00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.490
Uh, if we factorized, it it's two times, two times three,

217
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.400
uh, otherwise known as two squared, times three.

218
00:11:04.401 --> 00:11:07.340
And the problem factor is a prime of that form. There it is.

219
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.510
And it's got an odd power.

220
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:13.550
<v 1>So I'm guessing three times three times three. So 27.</v>

221
00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.790
<v 0>27 Is three queued. Could it be done?</v>

222
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.850
<v 1>So it should be on the death list of ones that can't be done.</v>

223
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.510
<v 0>There it is. There it is. So this test is good.</v>

224
00:11:23.511 --> 00:11:25.820
And if we checked some other ones, so for example,

225
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.350
18 might be a good one to check.

226
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:30.830
We factorized that it's two times three times three.

227
00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.880
It's definitely got a prime, which is three more than multiple or four,

228
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.000
but it's gone even power and 18 is not on the list. It can be done.

229
00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.250
So there's some complicated interactions with the funerals.

230
00:11:40.251 --> 00:11:41.510
If you want to investigate this,

231
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.030
which is a nice little accessible way of number theory to do,

232
00:11:44.031 --> 00:11:46.880
then you can check. If you found one slanted square that works,

233
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:48.740
you can actually prove, works really easily,

234
00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:51.020
that you multiply it by another slant is where the works.

235
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.090
Then you can build one. So it's to do with the multiplying,

236
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:54.640
which is why the prime is getting involved.

237
00:11:54.641 --> 00:11:57.250
Because everything that comes from multiplying is coming from primes.

238
00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:59.740
But if you want a very elementary starting problem,

239
00:11:59.741 --> 00:12:02.890
where can you draw a square on Lottie paper that sort of escalates relatively

240
00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:06.370
quickly into advanced number theory, which has an accessible proof,

241
00:12:06.371 --> 00:12:08.380
but it's definitely much harder than nine-year-old maths.

242
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.030
This is a really lovely example of it.

243
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:15.120
<v 1>Videos like this one always leave me wanting to get my brain in better shape.</v>

244
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.620
And one way to do that is to check out all the online courses at brilliant.

245
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:23.400
The number theory course is a great place to start. You get some right,

246
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:28.230
you get some wrong, but that's okay. That's all part of learning.

247
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:32.370
And all the courses on brilliant have been crafted by people who really care.

248
00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.190
They really think about how you navigate through these things,

249
00:12:35.191 --> 00:12:38.460
how you will learn. Everything goes step by step.

250
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.310
You'll learn one new thing and that'll help you in the next bit.

251
00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:46.230
There's loads of mathematics, science, all sorts of stuff to keep you occupied.

252
00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.360
And there's more stuff coming all the time.

253
00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.100
Have a look at these ones in the works,

254
00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.320
go and have a look at the brilliant site. There's lots of stuff.

255
00:12:52.321 --> 00:12:53.490
You can look there for free.

256
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.970
If you sign up for the premium membership that unlocks all the stuff,

257
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.770
you can get 20% off that by going to brilliant.org/number

258
00:13:01.771 --> 00:13:05.610
file, we spend so much time exercising and getting our bodies in shape.

259
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:08.940
Brilliant is a great place to go to get your brain in shape.

260
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:11.281
<v 0>Well,</v>

261
00:13:11.281 --> 00:13:14.460
the generation used to get taught that who probably was pretty much exactly the

262
00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:18.060
ratio 22 over seven. It's not quite, but it's unreasonably good.

263
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.530
And you can see on this diagram,

264
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.600
that is unreasonably good because this is irrational,

265
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:24.630
but it's really well approximated by something to do with number 22.
