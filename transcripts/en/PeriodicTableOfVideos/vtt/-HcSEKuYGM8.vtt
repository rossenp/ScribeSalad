00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:06.740
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.240
<v 1>Element 113 is the only one that I've discussed with an</v>

3
00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:12.920
ambassador. In fact,

4
00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:17.030
it's the only one I've discussed with two ambassadors because I've discussed it

5
00:00:17.031 --> 00:00:21.830
with both the old and the new Japanese ambassador to London.

6
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.930
And the reason why I was discussing is because element 113

7
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.700
is the first element to be definitely synthesized in

8
00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:36.200
Japan. And so it is a huge excitement in the country.

9
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.160
I was in Tokyo in February this year, 2016,

10
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.950
and I met a representative of Riken the lab

11
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.810
where these elements were synthesized and they gave me

12
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.420
a press release about the element.

13
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.520
The really exciting thing from their point of view is that they get to choose

14
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.050
the name of this element.

15
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.000
Now you have to understand that making the so-called super heavy

16
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:08.240
elements is not a quick process.

17
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.920
It's not like boiling things up in a test tube and finding a new

18
00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:16.280
element. It takes years and years and years,

19
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.810
and over the history of the search for elements.

20
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.400
The last 200 years,

21
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.020
there have been hundreds of claims by people believing that they have

22
00:01:27.021 --> 00:01:28.790
discovered new elements.

23
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.620
So now the process is extremely rigorous and now they've got to the

24
00:01:33.621 --> 00:01:36.500
final stage and the name has been chosen.

25
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.990
The name they chose with Niho Niamh,

26
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.330
which is a Latinized version of the Japanese name

27
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.710
for Japan Nihon. I'm sorry.

28
00:01:47.711 --> 00:01:49.490
I pronounced that incorrectly.

29
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.350
The experiments that led to this discovery began

30
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.290
a long time ago, more than 12 years ago,

31
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.960
and like all elements of this part of the periodic table they're made

32
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.260
by taking a heavy element in this case,

33
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.730
bismuth atomic number 83 and the light elements,

34
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.710
this case zinc accelerating the zinc two huge speed

35
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.780
and the nuclei fuse together to make an

36
00:02:20.781 --> 00:02:22.490
element of 113.

37
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.560
What you have to realize is that you take billions

38
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.550
and billions and perhaps trillions of zinc,

39
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:35.840
atoms to get one atom of element

40
00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:36.800
113.

41
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.990
Apparently the Japanese lab observed three

42
00:02:41.991 --> 00:02:44.750
atoms over a period of nine years.

43
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.340
So this is not something that you do quickly on the Friday afternoon and

44
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:50.683
publish the next day.

45
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.790
A huge amount of verification is needed to make sure

46
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.190
that what you see is genuine.

47
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.340
And the way that you detect these elements is that

48
00:03:03.341 --> 00:03:04.300
once they formed,

49
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.470
they shoot up to the back of the bismuth target onto a detector.

50
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.630
And then they decay radioactively into a chain of different elements.

51
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.400
And this chain of elements tells you which element you

52
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:22.480
formed because soon you get to parts of the periodic table where you know,

53
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:25.360
how the elements decay. What is amazing though,

54
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.730
is that people can also tell a little bit about the chemistry of

55
00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:31.660
these elements.

56
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.370
You can only do a limited amount of chemistry when you have one atom at a time,

57
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.080
but what they can do is to bounce the element,

58
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.920
the atom,

59
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.900
when it's subjected off some sort of surface say gold or

60
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.660
Teflon and see if there is any difference between the way they

61
00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:53.440
stick.

62
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.180
You can tell quite a bit about the elements just from the sticking.

63
00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.223
And in fact,

64
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.390
the measurements have been made and element 113 does stick to

65
00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:05.950
gold. Quite strongly.

66
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.930
This part of the periodic table is really unusual because just

67
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:11.770
by chance,

68
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.180
the way the atomic numbers add up the number of the elements

69
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:20.710
113 is the same as the group it's in,

70
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.100
or at least the 13 is it's in group 13,

71
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.200
the same element as boron.

72
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.500
And if you go down element 113,

73
00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:32.650
the holmium is just below thallium.

74
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.440
And we know quite a lot about the chemistry of thallium,

75
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.230
particularly it's very poisonous.

76
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.980
Now you can't tell whether the [inaudible] will be poisonous because you only

77
00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:46.540
have one atom. Even if you could get one atom inside somebody,

78
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.720
it would not poison them chemically though.

79
00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:52.510
It's radioactive decay could cause damage.

80
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.110
One of the things that's really interesting about thallium is that it has three

81
00:04:56.111 --> 00:04:59.800
electrons in its outer shell and in its chemistry,

82
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.610
it can lose either one of these to make the Italian plus souls,

83
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.560
or it can lose all three.

84
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.430
And I suspect that in the chemistry of element,

85
00:05:09.431 --> 00:05:10.750
113,

86
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.820
the plus one state would be even more prominent than in the

87
00:05:15.821 --> 00:05:17.620
chemistry of thallium.

88
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.550
Because if you go up the periodic table in the same group to Allie minium,

89
00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:26.110
you don't get aluminum. Plus at all, pneumonia is in the same group.

90
00:05:26.111 --> 00:05:30.130
So it has three outer electrons in just the same way as stallion,

91
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.290
assuming that the electrons are arranged in the same configuration,

92
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.090
because when you get to these large atoms,

93
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.840
the energy levels of the different cells are very close together.

94
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.250
So it would be possible in least in theory for the configuration to be

95
00:05:48.251 --> 00:05:49.084
different.

96
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.220
But people assume that it will be three electrons arranged in the same

97
00:05:54.221 --> 00:05:57.740
way as in boron, but much larger shelf.

98
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.360
The difficulty is that as the atoms get bigger, um,

99
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.240
if you imagine the electron like a particle,

100
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.730
they have to go round and round in the shell and the speeds they're going

101
00:06:10.731 --> 00:06:14.090
round approach the speed of light,

102
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.040
and therefore they mass changes and you get so-called relativistic effects.

103
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.360
We made the video about this on the properties of mercury,

104
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.870
which is a much lighter elements than element and in 13.

105
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.340
So people will have to do quite a lot of calculations.

106
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.970
And in the end, unfortunately,

107
00:06:34.971 --> 00:06:39.110
this will just be theory because it will be very difficult to verify them. Now,

108
00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:43.160
the important question that people always ask is what in earth is the point of

109
00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:44.960
making elements like this?

110
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:50.120
And the answer is that it gives us a much better understanding of how the

111
00:06:50.121 --> 00:06:54.650
protons and the neutrons in the nucleus bind together.

112
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.660
And it's only when you look at the extremes when they are binding together,

113
00:06:59.661 --> 00:07:03.620
relatively weakly, that you can test whether your theories are any good.

114
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.700
So although it's an enormously expensive experiment,

115
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.460
the results are really very useful.

116
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.590
<v 2>Professor, do we not already know enough about how protons and neutrons work?</v>

117
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.740
I mean, we can make an atom bombs and nuclear energy.

118
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:22.150
We understand that everyday elements very well. Why do we need to know more?

119
00:07:22.151 --> 00:07:24.670
Have we not? We're not sort of got our head around it enough.

120
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:30.010
<v 3>The radium nucleus threw off an alpha particle consisting of two protons</v>

121
00:07:30.011 --> 00:07:31.540
and two neutron.

122
00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:36.970
<v 1>The importance of these experiments is that there have been predictions</v>

123
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.750
that when you get very heavy elements,

124
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.520
the so-called super heavy elements,

125
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:47.290
they may become more stable than one might expect in

126
00:07:47.291 --> 00:07:50.860
general, what has been found as people who've gone up to high,

127
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.880
heavier and heavier nuclei, they've become less and less stable.

128
00:07:55.270 --> 00:08:00.040
But now there is some indication that these very heavy elements are more

129
00:08:00.041 --> 00:08:03.850
stable than one might expect. That doesn't mean they're very stable.

130
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.880
They may only last a small fraction of a second,

131
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:12.190
but that's longer than people might have expected just by extrapolating the

132
00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:16.090
lifetimes of the other ones. I think it's a great honor to anybody,

133
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.350
to any country.

134
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:22.630
And I think it is a very nice example of collaboration between

135
00:08:22.631 --> 00:08:26.050
different countries, because although it was discovered in Japan,

136
00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:31.120
its existence was verified and justified by experiments in

137
00:08:31.121 --> 00:08:36.010
Germany and Russia. So it's a very good example of international collaboration.

138
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:38.950
I find the name slightly difficult to pronounce,

139
00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.410
but it's a lot better than [inaudible]

140
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:41.410
, which I find almost impossible to pronounce. This is the press release. And on the back is a photo of the leader of the team professor 

141
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:41.410
Merita with presumably the periodic table showing elements

142
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:41.410
. But the thing I really like is the quotation at the end, it says for Merita, then part of the coming year will be devoted to thinking of and proposing a formal name. They've now done that, but he's looking forward to the next step in his research. We plan now to look to the uncharted territory of element 119 and beyond aiming to examine the chemical properties of the elements in the seventh and eight through 

143
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:41.410
of

144
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:41.410
 the periodic table and someday to discover the Island of stability. So all being well, there'll be lots more periodic videos on the subject. Oh, I'm wearing a Japanese happy, which was given to me in Tokyo by a great fan nugget. Yes. So Noah and you can see unfortunately, element 113 comes here in my 

145
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:42.243
arm pit. It's a really nice periodic table and it's even better on the bank.

146
00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.320
<v 5>Hello. And then see where the arms go</v>

147
00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.050
by the time we get to here. Yeah.

148
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.930
It's already traveling 5% of the speed of light.

149
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:20.630
<v 4>So Target's here and Savine rotates is about 1005</v>

150
00:10:20.631 --> 00:10:21.770
valuations per minute.
