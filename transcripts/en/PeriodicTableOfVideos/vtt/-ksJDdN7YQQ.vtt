00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.530
<v 0>When I was a student. In fact, when I was at high school,</v>

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.410
we had to do analytical chemistry,

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.330
trying to identify different irons, like bromide, iodide,

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.690
chloride, and we did all sorts of tests.

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.860
So I thought it'd be quite fun to get Sam to do one of these things.

6
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.963
<v 1>These tests.</v>

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.540
<v 0>Look really quite pretty. The, when I was a school, boy,</v>

8
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.100
I found them really tedious.

9
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.870
It involves adding silver nitrate to the solutions and you get to

10
00:00:32.871 --> 00:00:35.660
precipitate. When you add the silver nitrate,

11
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.360
you get silver ions in the solution,

12
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.710
which also contains nitrate because you put in silver nitrate,

13
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.740
but also chloride or bring my door iodide.

14
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.280
And the silver highlights are very insoluble.

15
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.030
So when the silver and the Haylight Dan's meet,

16
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.580
they form a solid and precipitate.

17
00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.110
So there is quite a nice reaction and you get a

18
00:01:00.111 --> 00:01:02.810
precipitate of different colors,

19
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.580
depending which halogen you use. So as a test,

20
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.890
although I didn't mention this to Sam,

21
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.920
she decided she would use fluoride as well.

22
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.320
That's all for halogens.

23
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.040
You can get easily as the teen and the new one, Tennessee,

24
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.720
aren't really available to do lab experiments.

25
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.460
Silver ions with fluoride was a bit

26
00:01:28.461 --> 00:01:32.930
disappointing. Silver fluoride is reasonably soluble in water.

27
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.200
So you don't form a precipitate with silver chloride.

28
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.970
You get a fairly white precipitate and these precipitation reactions

29
00:01:40.971 --> 00:01:43.370
take place incredibly fast,

30
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.400
much faster than your eye can follow.

31
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.590
This is not something that gradually develops. One minute. It's clear.

32
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.070
Next minute, silver bromide is pale yellow.

33
00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.593
<v 1>And silver.</v>

34
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.200
<v 0>Now, what am I telling you about these compounds?</v>

35
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.060
And the reason is that these silver highlights have been

36
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.430
technologically very important,

37
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.560
particularly silver Bromite because silver bromide was the

38
00:02:39.561 --> 00:02:44.030
material that was used for old-fashioned photographic film.

39
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.870
Nowadays, everybody takes digital pictures,

40
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.210
but until really quite recently,

41
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.800
most photographs were taken on film and the film

42
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.680
has a layer of silver bromide, crystals, very small ones.

43
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.780
And the amazing thing about silver broom and crystals is that when

44
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:09.640
they absorb light, they are dissociated.

45
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.790
So you get silver metal formed.

46
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.600
You don't get very much silver metal formed,

47
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.380
but then when you put it into developing solution,

48
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.990
that tiny piece of silver acts as a catalyst and bigger

49
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:29.980
particles grow to give you the black color and black and white film.

50
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.840
I hope one day we will be able to show you in the dark room,

51
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.150
the chemistry of film,

52
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.430
but this compound that sitting in the test tube is the basis of all

53
00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:46.120
photographic film. There is one quite funny question,

54
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.950
which people sometimes ask,

55
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.990
which is what is the color of unexposed photographic film

56
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.460
that is film, which has not been exposed to light,

57
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.750
because if you want to know the color of something,

58
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.340
you have to shine light on it. And if you sign light on it,

59
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.320
the film has been exposed.

60
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.840
<v 1>So.</v>

61
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.110
<v 0>Nobody really knows what the color of unexposed film is.</v>

62
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.820
And silver iodide crystals have a really

63
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.550
unexpected application,

64
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.120
which is to make rain in the sky.

65
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.800
There's a lot of water vapor and the water vapor can condense to form

66
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.890
clouds and the clouds produce rain.

67
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.840
The problem is that water vapor has to be cooled to very low temperature

68
00:04:37.841 --> 00:04:41.260
before it will spontaneously form crystals of ice.

69
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.370
But if there are tiny particles in the air,

70
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.170
this acts as a nucleus and the water droplets or ice particles can form

71
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.640
random shortly after the second world war, about 70 years ago,

72
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.740
it was suddenly realized that the structure of the crystals of silver

73
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.390
iodide have the same sort of spacing of the atoms as in crystals of

74
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:09.340
ice. So people have the idea of injecting, very fine,

75
00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:12.280
powders of silver iodide into the air,

76
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.110
where clouds were forming to make them form thicker clouds and therefore

77
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:18.790
terrain. And it works,

78
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.980
but nobody quite knows how and most recently people have done

79
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.970
experiments.

80
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.050
And so the ice doesn't form in the way that people thought.

81
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.210
And so the spacing of the atoms on the silver iodide is not

82
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.690
the relevant property, but it still seems to work.

83
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.490
And so in many countries now people use silver

84
00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:44.110
iodide for seeding clouds.

85
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.303
<v 1>Did I lie? Now.</v>

86
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.520
<v 0>There are two reasons for seeding clouds.</v>

87
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.240
One reason is to make it rain,

88
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.970
to make your plants grow better.

89
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.240
The other reason is to get the clouds to

90
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:07.040
start producing rain before a real storm starts.

91
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.660
If you don't see the clouds, then they build up and up and up,

92
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.020
and then suddenly it stopped producing large hail stones,

93
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.210
which can cause enormous damage, smashing buildings, denting cars, and so on.

94
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.550
So silver iodide can reduce,

95
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:30.290
or people believe that it can reduce the force of a

96
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:32.840
storm and cause less damage underneath.

97
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.030
<v 2>To one side. Yep. In fact, before we do that,</v>

98
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.080
I want to take a selfie with it.

99
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.910
This is me and the first paper to describe like photos properly.

100
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:48.220
You lock in that.

101
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.950
<v 3>Got it. Yep. They range in price depending on what the scene is.</v>

102
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:58.000
It's artistic value from around 10,000 pounds to

103
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.470
the most expensive print in this box has been valued at half a million pounds

104
00:07:02.471 --> 00:07:05.350
for one photograph, half a million pounds.
