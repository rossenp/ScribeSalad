00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.220
<v 0>This episode was made possible by Wix.</v>

2
00:00:02.221 --> 00:00:04.410
And we'll tell you more about them later in the episode.

3
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.650
<v 1>That's a stainless steel container that has plutonium oxide.</v>

4
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.420
So hopefully that stuff will see its way onto some spacecraft in the mid 2020

5
00:00:17.421 --> 00:00:18.254
timeframe.

6
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.230
<v 0>Brady has been to really amazing lab where they're synthesizing</v>

7
00:00:24.231 --> 00:00:28.790
plutonium and they're making the plutonium to plow

8
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.680
spacecraft spacecraft that go to really distant places,

9
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.220
far too far from the sun to use solar sails.

10
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.950
So they need to use plutonium two, three eight,

11
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.300
which can generate heat through its radioactive decay and power.

12
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.830
The spacecraft the plutonium is made from neptunium.

13
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.020
The technical problem that has to be solved is that the neptunium

14
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.280
is supplied to the Oakridge lamp as a solution.

15
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.193
<v 1>Okay?</v>

16
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.840
So this is where we convert the neptunium liquid solution.

17
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.190
It's in a nitric acid solution and we can convert it to a solid that's,

18
00:01:10.191 --> 00:01:13.970
a low concentration, and neptunium in that it gets to be a really,

19
00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:18.530
really dark green whenever it's very concentrated, we'll put it into this unit,

20
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.810
pump it through a, essentially a rotary kill.

21
00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:23.030
And that's in the other glove box on the other side.

22
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.530
And that converts the neptunium liquid solution to an oxide powder.

23
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.260
This is the automated pellet press right here.

24
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.490
It's going to first clean this dye out. It has to be really,

25
00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:36.230
really clean before we use it.

26
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.760
Now it gets a little bit of lubricant and they'll come over and they'll sit in

27
00:01:40.761 --> 00:01:43.760
the center of the glove box waiting for that solution to dry.

28
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.800
So it's just going to sit there for about 45 seconds or so. Yeah,

29
00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:51.770
there you go. That's the funnel down. I'm just going to go pick up a vile.

30
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.680
So what's the,

31
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.300
in the violence picked up that's Neptuny monoxide and mixed with aluminum

32
00:01:56.301 --> 00:01:59.330
powder. Now it takes off the cap.

33
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.040
Now it's going to dump down the powder into the funnel.

34
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.930
Now it's going to replace the cap on the vile and in a

35
00:02:14.931 --> 00:02:15.381
second,

36
00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:19.670
it'll take the vile back and put it back in to the position that it pulled it

37
00:02:19.671 --> 00:02:21.290
out of. Now,

38
00:02:21.291 --> 00:02:24.500
occasionally there's a little bit of powder that's left in the top of the

39
00:02:24.501 --> 00:02:24.831
funnel.

40
00:02:24.831 --> 00:02:29.390
So it's going to pick up a little tool and brush the powder into the dye.

41
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.310
That fat part of the unit is what we call the dye and then the punches on top.

42
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.160
And you'll see it put a punch into place shortly.

43
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.430
It's going to come over and gets rid of the funnel. First

44
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.480
punch is going to go sit inside.

45
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.780
Now it's going to pick up the whole unit and go put it underneath the press and

46
00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:51.860
that'll start pressing.

47
00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:56.360
And now they'll start the same operation again for another die and punch set.

48
00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.680
When you sit here looking at this powder and what's being done here and knowing

49
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:00.040
that some of.

50
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.080
<v 2>This stuff's going to end up in space, is that pretty cool?</v>

51
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.660
<v 1>It's pretty cool. Yeah, it's pretty cool.</v>

52
00:03:03.661 --> 00:03:07.770
It's pretty cool to be able to be part of the space program and be able to be

53
00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:12.180
contributing material and knowing that this material will be used for decades to

54
00:03:12.181 --> 00:03:15.720
come. The automated process almost seems very human.

55
00:03:15.721 --> 00:03:16.890
Doesn't it like giving something,

56
00:03:16.891 --> 00:03:20.340
a little shake and a little tap and the little habits that one might do in a

57
00:03:20.341 --> 00:03:21.174
lab.

58
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.160
<v 0>But I think the reason why the robot has been made to mimic a</v>

59
00:03:26.161 --> 00:03:30.240
human is because we know what a human would do.

60
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.830
And we know what works.

61
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.970
If you were trying to do some really sophisticated new

62
00:03:35.971 --> 00:03:40.710
process, you'd have to do endless experiments to see whether it works or not.

63
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.480
But we know that the little brush of the funnel or tap is going to work.

64
00:03:45.481 --> 00:03:50.250
So it's easier to automate that than to reinvent some new process.

65
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.680
<v 1>Are we good at 52 press pellets? And it's in a little transfer device,</v>

66
00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.090
we call it a boat and that boat comes over and it sits in the center of this

67
00:04:00.091 --> 00:04:03.050
unit, the actual pellets, those are actual pellets.

68
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.790
That's got the neptunium in it.

69
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.520
We've got four lasers that actually measure diameter and two different points on

70
00:04:08.521 --> 00:04:09.300
the pallet.

71
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.320
Now it's just searching for the center of that pallet and just to vacuum device

72
00:04:13.321 --> 00:04:17.610
to pick that up, it's measured the diameters. Now it goes, sets it down.

73
00:04:17.611 --> 00:04:21.000
Now it's going to measure the length and approve.

74
00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:25.950
So now it puts it into that cassette the pellets get put down in these

75
00:04:25.951 --> 00:04:30.480
little holes and there's 53 holes around the perimeter on both the inside and

76
00:04:30.481 --> 00:04:33.420
the outside that holds enough pellets for one target.

77
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.440
We unload those next door and we just drop the pellets down into the target.

78
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.350
That's the whole process of building a target. So for us,

79
00:04:40.351 --> 00:04:43.350
the big deal with that we have here is the fact that we're going from making

80
00:04:43.351 --> 00:04:48.000
about 40 to 50 targets a year to making it at least 200 a year in

81
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.391
annex.

82
00:04:48.391 --> 00:04:52.050
And then eventually we'll get another line on the other side of the room and

83
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.070
we'll be making around 400 targets a year in order to make the production we

84
00:04:56.071 --> 00:04:59.190
need for, to supply NASA. They want more and more.

85
00:04:59.191 --> 00:05:02.850
And actually we think that going into the latter part of the next decade,

86
00:05:02.851 --> 00:05:04.860
we'll probably be asked to increase our production,

87
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.970
but that's something that we're, we talked to NASA about on a routine basis.

88
00:05:08.971 --> 00:05:13.530
So it's, it's a, it's a program where you got to plan for the next 10 years.

89
00:05:13.531 --> 00:05:15.600
You can't discipline what you're going to do tomorrow,

90
00:05:15.601 --> 00:05:18.630
because by that time it's too late, you can't do anything about it.

91
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.800
Okay? Now we're going to, what we call is the control room.

92
00:05:31.801 --> 00:05:34.980
This is where we have heavily shielded hot cells.

93
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.720
And that's how we work on the, um,

94
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.390
irradiated targets safely so that we can say,

95
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.960
we make the plutonium and give that again, give it some NASA.

96
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.370
<v 2>Your ELA, minium, and Neptunian oxide spins.</v>

97
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.930
It's 50 days baking and nutrients. You've made a whole bunch of new plutonium,

98
00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.040
but you've also made a lot of other stuff. We don't.

99
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.030
<v 1>Want a lot of fishing products. And this is what you do. The chemistry. Yeah.</v>

100
00:06:02.031 --> 00:06:03.350
This is where we do the chemistry.

101
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.390
The radiation dose is just too high to handle in anything but a heavily shielded

102
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.980
hot cell. This is four and a half feet of shielding.

103
00:06:09.981 --> 00:06:14.210
It's a combination of led glass and mineral oil led glass to shield from the

104
00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:15.860
Gamma's intense gamma source.

105
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.130
And the mineral oil is used to shield for neutrons.

106
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.570
<v 0>Yeah, yeah, no, yeah. That's liquid. Yeah. So if I punched a hole in that.</v>

107
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.600
<v 1>Which I can't do a whole bunch of oil would mention the oil would come out.</v>

108
00:06:28.601 --> 00:06:29.434
Yeah. Yeah.

109
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.550
All this equipment in here is used for the processing chemical processing.

110
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.230
We have a dissolver the top of it is in the floor of that cubicle and you see

111
00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:41.230
all the pipes coming off of it. So that's why we call dissolver.

112
00:06:41.231 --> 00:06:42.064
There's actually a,

113
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.570
an opening it's about say four to five inches in diameter that we take our

114
00:06:46.571 --> 00:06:51.310
targets and those are lowered into the dissolver we'll do about 20 or

115
00:06:51.311 --> 00:06:56.100
30 targets at a time and dissolve the aluminum. And so using a,

116
00:06:56.101 --> 00:07:00.820
a sodium hydroxide solution. And then once we dissolved all the aluminum,

117
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.760
we decamped that and get rid of all the liquid waste.

118
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.690
And then we come back and hit the actinides with concentrated nitric acid

119
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:10.930
concentrate, nitric acid will dissolve the actinides.

120
00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:15.310
And that allows us to start doing the chemical processing to separate the

121
00:07:15.311 --> 00:07:18.040
plutonium and the neptunium from the fission products.

122
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.640
Have we got some targets in there that we could take a look at? Fortunately,

123
00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:25.300
these guys do this. Yeah. So what we've got over,

124
00:07:25.301 --> 00:07:28.540
there is some targets that we use during our experimental program.

125
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:32.170
That's an actual target that we use. If we were planning on processing it,

126
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:36.400
we cut off the top and the bottom because the top four inches and the bottom

127
00:07:36.401 --> 00:07:39.550
four inches are just aluminum. And what we want is the, uh,

128
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.150
neptunium oxide and plutonium oxide. That's in the center of that target.

129
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.800
So we'd actually cut off the top and bottom and then put about 20 to 30 targets

130
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:52.360
inside the dissolver and then pump the liquid sodium hydroxide in to start the

131
00:07:52.361 --> 00:07:53.680
dissolution process.

132
00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:57.970
So each one of those targets is going to give us just under four grams of

133
00:07:57.971 --> 00:08:02.950
plutonium oxide as a product we have to run through around 400 of those a

134
00:08:02.951 --> 00:08:05.290
year in order to make enough material.

135
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:08.830
One thing that's kind of cool about the Neptune plutonium is they'll turn

136
00:08:08.831 --> 00:08:09.730
certain colors.

137
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:14.470
So if you see a color exiting in the right way,

138
00:08:14.471 --> 00:08:16.780
you're pretty confident that it's working, right? So if see,

139
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.420
in dark green going out, your neptunium is going out.

140
00:08:19.421 --> 00:08:23.110
If you see kind of a purple-ish or magenta color coming this other way,

141
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:27.370
you got your plutonium. So it's, you can visually kind of see what's going on,

142
00:08:27.371 --> 00:08:28.181
which is kind of cool.

143
00:08:28.181 --> 00:08:32.140
Then we have a lot of ways we actually measure those concentrations to get very

144
00:08:32.141 --> 00:08:33.070
precise results.

145
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.370
<v 0>What do you think when you see these people that have to work with something</v>

146
00:08:36.371 --> 00:08:40.270
that's just so dangerous? Like, does it give you chills? Well,

147
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:44.620
I found it exciting. Of course, although the material is dangerous,

148
00:08:44.621 --> 00:08:47.980
it's so well protected or they're well protected from them.

149
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.390
It isn't dangerous, but you always wonder what would go wrong.

150
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:57.990
And I think it's a really good lesson to us chemists about how you can do

151
00:08:57.991 --> 00:09:00.270
really quite dangerous experiments.

152
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:05.070
If you take the right precautions and have the right equipment accidents happen

153
00:09:05.071 --> 00:09:09.570
in chemistry, when you use the wrong equipment or you don't take precautions.

154
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:14.830
<v 1>Bob, where are you? You haven't. I have no. Did you use to do it or is it never,</v>

155
00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:19.820
never tried? I, I, my first chemistry experiment in a lab, I,

156
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:25.040
we were doing a very complex separation and I had it in a

157
00:09:25.041 --> 00:09:27.260
little bottle. And then as I was moving around a,

158
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:31.790
dumped the bottle on the ground and had to try to sweep it all up and I didn't

159
00:09:31.791 --> 00:09:35.480
get a very high grade on that test, that, that experiment now that was not,

160
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:37.940
yeah. I leave it to the experts. Yeah.

161
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.770
<v 3>Can't believe how like gentle you can be with that thing.</v>

162
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:56.090
<v 1>That's a stainless steel container that has plutonium oxide made in</v>

163
00:09:56.091 --> 00:09:59.930
what we call our campaign three, which we did last spring.

164
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:04.550
And so this material is going to be held in self until we get the capability to

165
00:10:04.551 --> 00:10:06.440
be able to ship it out to Los Alamos.

166
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:11.240
So hopefully that stuff will see its way onto some spacecraft in the mid 2020

167
00:10:11.241 --> 00:10:12.074
timeframe.

168
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:18.020
<v 0>I really liked how our guide was so excited</v>

169
00:10:18.021 --> 00:10:22.910
and pleased that he was participating albeit indirectly

170
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:24.470
in the space mission.

171
00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.370
And I think it really demonstrates how,

172
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:33.410
even in really weird technological events

173
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:38.450
like spacecraft going to Pluto underneath and backing

174
00:10:38.451 --> 00:10:40.880
it all is a chemist. Yeah.

175
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.190
<v 4>This video was supported by Wix,</v>

176
00:10:46.191 --> 00:10:50.090
which also happens to be who we've used to make this new periodic videos

177
00:10:50.091 --> 00:10:53.030
website, pretty nifty. Hey,

178
00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:57.740
and here's a little sneak peek under the hood where we've used weeks to design,

179
00:10:57.741 --> 00:11:00.530
make changes, get things looking just right.

180
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.850
I have to say I've been really impressed by just how much control you have over

181
00:11:04.851 --> 00:11:07.910
a Wix site. Sure. They have some templates to get,

182
00:11:07.911 --> 00:11:11.120
you started lots of templates actually, but there's no detail.

183
00:11:11.121 --> 00:11:14.030
You can't find tune and tweak to get it just how you want it.

184
00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:15.650
No little bell or whistle.

185
00:11:15.651 --> 00:11:19.280
You can't add to get your site doing what you want it to do.

186
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.160
Just imagine what the periodic table might've looked like.

187
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:26.420
If Dmitri Mendeleev had used Wix now to check them out yourself,

188
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:31.250
go to wix.com/go/periodic videos.

189
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:32.780
There's the address on the screen?

190
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:37.670
wix.com/go/periodic videos and our thanks to

191
00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.560
Wix for supporting this episode.

192
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.320
<v 3>And we convert about 10%.</v>

193
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.350
<v 1>Of that. Neptunium two 37 to platonic.</v>

194
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.160
<v 3>38.</v>
