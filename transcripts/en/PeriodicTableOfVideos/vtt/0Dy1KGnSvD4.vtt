00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.670
<v 0>Um, so we have in here, if you can see in there a reaction vessel,</v>

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.530
we have phenol already kind of, uh,

3
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.910
uh, crystalline kind of material. Um,

4
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.980
we have here some formaldehyde. So I'm just going to add this in

5
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.480
a little bit, just turn the heat up a little bit.

6
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.900
Um, and I'm going to put in some, uh, CT acids.

7
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.940
All right. So this is our

8
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.090
reaction mixture. So this isn't turned on.

9
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.130
So if we turn it on there,

10
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.160
so what we did yesterday,

11
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.060
have you ever had this many cameras?

12
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.500
So what we're going to do is, um, we're going to leave this for awhile,

13
00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:32.340
just so we have a nice intimate mixture between the feet, all on the, uh,

14
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.630
from all the HUD. And that'll hit sit there happily,

15
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.200
and nothing will happen until we add this,

16
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.390
which is concentrated hydrochloric acid.

17
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.330
So I'm going to add about 10 mils or so of

18
00:01:48.331 --> 00:01:52.420
the HCL, um, which, which activates the, uh,

19
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.150
from all the height should kickstart things. Um,

20
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.400
so what we will do is, um, when they're ready,

21
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.473
they're ready

22
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.890
just to show lower,

23
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.730
right? So I'm putting in some asset now,

24
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.700
some concentrated HCL.

25
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.830
So usually

26
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.000
when we do this, nothing happens until we, uh,

27
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.730
get to the last couple of meals.

28
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.400
I am out in the asset quite slowly.

29
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.040
So what we should be looking out for them is the pink color.

30
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.900
So how's, it starts to go.

31
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.980
You should see a really nice pink color form in the solution.

32
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.353
Okay.

33
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.950
Now we give it a couple of minutes.

34
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.910
I think we might be seeing some pink comment.

35
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.183
Here we go.

36
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.103
We've made a plastic.

37
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.060
What's your thing really control. Yeah.

38
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.640
Well-behaved I don't know why. Um, can we.

39
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.990
<v 1>Miss what's the difference?</v>

40
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.913
Uh.

41
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.110
<v 2>Let me get a couple shots of it.</v>

42
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.910
<v 0>Okay. So we're going to give this another goal and, um,</v>

43
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.880
the difference this time is we're going to apply a bit more heat and see if

44
00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:32.980
there's any difference. Um,

45
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.580
see if we can get things to go a bit more vigorously as we like,

46
00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:40.030
things like that on the, uh, periodic videos. All right,

47
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.900
ready? I'm ready. Right.

48
00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:55.810
So we have our acids going in.

49
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.190
[inaudible] Might be getting some pink.

50
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:06.660
<v 3>[Inaudible] Not bad, not bad.</v>

51
00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.110
<v 1>Still have the same. What's different. What we changed.</v>

52
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.740
<v 2>It took a long time. It did. Didn't it.</v>
