00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:06.680
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.420
<v 1>Yeah. So this is C ballgame, which I have a periodic table here.</v>

3
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.340
It probably be helpful if I point it out to you. It's right down here,

4
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.730
more or less in the middle, but very much towards the bottom.

5
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.680
And this isn't a row of elements that are really quite special because these

6
00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:29.330
guys come after the lanthanides and actinides which these two rows

7
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:30.980
down here are,

8
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.520
these elements are special because they don't hang around very long.

9
00:00:34.521 --> 00:00:38.930
These elements are actually really unstable and they decay.

10
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.920
This is radio activity at work. So if you want to do anything with these,

11
00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:45.650
you've got to actually make the elements.

12
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.860
You can't just go to a chemical company and buy a job of them.

13
00:00:48.861 --> 00:00:50.090
You've actually got to make them.

14
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.360
And then you've got to turn them into a compound that you're interested in and

15
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.350
analyze it very, very quickly. And some of these elements,

16
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.060
they can come and go within eight, 10, 15 seconds, minutes.

17
00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:03.730
They really don't hang around. You.

18
00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:07.100
You've made them what you want to do with them. Well, the answer could be,

19
00:01:07.101 --> 00:01:11.870
let's make some interesting molecules out of them that we can study and

20
00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:15.440
therefore learn about some of the properties that these elements have,

21
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.520
because at the minute,

22
00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:19.850
because there's so little known about them because a they're very difficult to

23
00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:23.300
make. And even if you do make them, they come and go so quickly.

24
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.550
We don't have expect very much experimental evidence to

25
00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:30.950
help to validate the theoretical models we've got.

26
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.880
The theories are really great, but we need to know that they're accurate.

27
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.620
And so for example,

28
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.320
[inaudible] should be very similar to analogous group six metals.

29
00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:46.490
Higher-up like tungsten, molybdenum, and chromium.

30
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.810
These are very well known, quite well understood elements.

31
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.220
You can make nice stable compounds out of them that will hang around for weeks,

32
00:01:55.221 --> 00:01:59.690
months, and years. And you expect certain periodic trends to occur.

33
00:01:59.691 --> 00:02:03.350
As you go down that group from chromium molybdenum to tungsten.

34
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.610
And the question is what then happens when you go to the really super heavy

35
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.190
Seaborg helium and the next row down.

36
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.310
And so you can predict what you may expect,

37
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.060
but what you need to do is go out and do some experiments to help validate that

38
00:02:17.061 --> 00:02:17.510
theory.

39
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.250
So the news is that a have a search team prepared some Seaborg

40
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.660
Liam, and this is a really elegant reaction. They take some Curium,

41
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.670
which is element number 96,

42
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.650
and they smash some neon into it, which is element number 10.

43
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.060
And that gives you together element 106, which is C ballgame.

44
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.110
Now the clock's ticking because already they're going to start to fall to bits.

45
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.370
And so the answer is, well, the question rather is what are you going to do? Ah,

46
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.360
this particular piece of research is really elegant because what it does is it

47
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.430
generates the sea ballgame atoms,

48
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.330
and very quickly reacts them with carbon monoxide.

49
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.240
And the thing about carbon monoxide is a combined two metal atoms.

50
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.040
In fact, this is one of the reasons why carbon monoxide is not good for humans.

51
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:07.030
If you inhale it,

52
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.800
it sticks onto the iron in your hemoglobin and stops oxygen being transported

53
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:13.990
around your body. But in this case,

54
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:18.670
this has been used to our advantage that you can make a Seaborg helium with

55
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:21.730
six carbon monoxide bonded to it.

56
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.260
And this is really helpful because now it turns out that this molecule is

57
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:30.820
volatile. And because it's volatile, you can get it into the gas phase,

58
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.340
quickly weapon off to a detector,

59
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.100
and then confirm that you've made it.

60
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.140
So the reason it's important is it's a volatile compound that you can examine

61
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.660
and you would expect it to be very similar to that. Analogous chromium,

62
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.560
molybdenum, and tungsten carbonyls. And importantly,

63
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.060
they've been known for many decades and we understand their properties very

64
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:58.990
well. And indeed earlier today, we were just, subliming some,

65
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.510
a group six metal carbon dials,

66
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.230
just to show how they go from being a solid into the gas phase.

67
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.890
And then they come back out again, there's a lovely crystalline solid,

68
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.390
and you would expect the Seaborg Liam Carbonell to be just like this.

69
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.020
The problem is you can't make anywhere near as much of the sea ballgame

70
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.200
Carbondale, and it doesn't hang around long enough to go and put it in a jar.

71
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.050
So the idea behind the project is that you make

72
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.370
the analogous molybdenum and tungsten systems in situ on the same system.

73
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.320
And then when you do it with sea ballgame,

74
00:04:35.321 --> 00:04:39.280
you know what you're looking for and through a very interesting and advanced set

75
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:43.030
of arrays, it's very elegant work. You can then detect the sea ballgame.

76
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.740
Carbonyl coming out of this system where you've made the atoms of Seaborg Liam

77
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.420
added the carbon monoxide and then fired it down to a detector so that they've

78
00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:54.970
got a bunker of, uh, detectors,

79
00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.190
which they have to calibrate. And they do all sorts of control experiments.

80
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.030
Uh,

81
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.140
my understanding is one of the ways they were looking out to make sure they had

82
00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:09.280
the sea ballgame is that C ballgame decays through a certain number of

83
00:05:09.281 --> 00:05:13.630
processes, which I think are fairly well understood.

84
00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:14.770
And you can predict,

85
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.290
and this series of transformations shows up in the detectors and nothing like

86
00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:23.650
that can happen when there's no sea ball game around. So if it does occur,

87
00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:26.080
you know, it has to be down to the sea ballgame.

88
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.080
<v 2>I can easily understand the reason to create a molecule involving</v>

89
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.980
Seaborg Liam in order to test the theories of what will happen.

90
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.140
Whereas theories correct harder to understand perhaps is why it's

91
00:05:40.141 --> 00:05:44.700
even worth having good, solid theories of what Seaborg and will do,

92
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.240
because seaboard will always be, uh,

93
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.790
something that falls apart and doesn't exist for very long.

94
00:05:50.791 --> 00:05:54.240
So do we need a huge wealth of knowledge about it?

95
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.010
It's not like it's going to help other chemists because no one can work.

96
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.310
<v 1>With this thing anyway. No, and I disagree with you there. Actually,</v>

97
00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:06.050
I think it does help as chemists because part

98
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.000
actually the theory aspect,

99
00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:12.950
you can't overstate how important that is because we are only as good

100
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:15.860
as our understanding of the natural world around us.

101
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:18.980
And that's a bit like saying Mars is a long way away.

102
00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:21.890
And so therefore I don't care what goes on there.

103
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.750
You should care what goes on there,

104
00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:27.860
because it will inform you about the basic principles and the laws that our

105
00:06:27.861 --> 00:06:30.920
universe operates under. And so

106
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.570
when you read the paper about this, Sebald Carbondale,

107
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.760
there's a discussion about how well a carbon monoxide bond to the metal and

108
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:44.060
will it be stronger or weaker than the analogous chromium,

109
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:48.140
molybdenum and tungsten systems. Now, this is really important because remember,

110
00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:52.010
I've already said carbon monoxide will bond to iron and poison you.

111
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.140
We need to understand how these types of molecules do interact with these metal

112
00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.300
sensors, because this informs our understanding of chemistry and a much broader

113
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.680
context. So although it seems like a really specialist,

114
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.950
very unusual thing that no one would care about.

115
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:13.550
It's actually got quite profound implications for our broader understanding of

116
00:07:13.551 --> 00:07:14.384
chemistry.

117
00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:16.330
<v 3>Uh, finally,</v>

118
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:21.430
I guess finally it got approved in 1997 and it

119
00:07:21.431 --> 00:07:23.020
got approved soon enough.

120
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:28.060
So seaboard could stand at the periodic table like this

121
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.370
and point to his element.

122
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.720
And we were so happy that he was still alive.

123
00:07:34.721 --> 00:07:38.530
And could point here, this is Seaborg him.
