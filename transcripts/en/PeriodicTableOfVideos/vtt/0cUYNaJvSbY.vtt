00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.630
<v 0>This episode has been brought to you by the great courses. Plus.</v>

2
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.680
<v 1>I'm going to tell you some more about molybdenum wires and show you some</v>

3
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.150
amazing micrographs pictures,

4
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.310
the lights of which I've never seen before.

5
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.560
So let me remind some of you that we did an experiment or Neil did

6
00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:26.210
an experiment where he puts a high current through a piece of molybdenum

7
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.390
wire piece of horizontal molybdenum wire.

8
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.420
And amazingly at the end,

9
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.740
we got blobs of material all the way along the wire

10
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.710
separated very regularly.

11
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.540
And the first thing we had to do was to see whether this

12
00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:46.220
experiment could be repeated.

13
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.810
So we did the experiment two or three times again,

14
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.540
and each time we got the same result.

15
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.720
Now, when we did it,

16
00:01:08.721 --> 00:01:13.520
the first time I suggested that what was

17
00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:17.060
happening was that we were forming liquid on the surface.

18
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.350
And that surface tension was separating the liquid into little droplets.

19
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.510
In fact, these droplets have a technical name,

20
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.100
which I learnt by looking at some papers, they're called undue Lloyds.

21
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.310
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

22
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.760
<v 1>Our last video in which we showed you these until Lloyd's got people,</v>

23
00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:57.110
very excited and quite a number of viewers suggested in the

24
00:01:57.111 --> 00:02:01.970
comments that we should try heating the wire in a vertical

25
00:02:01.971 --> 00:02:06.590
position, because then if a liquid was being formed, it would run down.

26
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.200
So when somebody proposes a test like that,

27
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.490
you've got to try it.

28
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.220
You were right. Instead of getting regular blobs,

29
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.510
what's happened was the liquid formed and ran down.

30
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.360
We got a big globe at the bottom and the tiny one where

31
00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:43.130
the Y had burned through.

32
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:53.270
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

33
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.950
<v 1>It looked as if the regular Angie Lloyds were starting to form,</v>

34
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.430
but then it didn't happen.

35
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.080
And the liquid ran down and formed one big blob at the bottom

36
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.050
and the way then broke.

37
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.610
And there was a small blowup left at the end of the broken way.

38
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.800
So I was really pleased because it confirmed my suggestion

39
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.260
that there was liquid,

40
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.620
but that raises quite a different problem,

41
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.680
which is why should there be liquid?

42
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.590
But the clue came when Neil took

43
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.720
one of these wires to our nanotechnology center and

44
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.910
there they can use electron microscope to take

45
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.350
images of the [inaudible] or the surface of the underline.

46
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.130
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

47
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.610
<v 1>What came back was absolutely amazing.</v>

48
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.160
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

49
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.300
<v 1>One of the pictures.</v>

50
00:04:12.301 --> 00:04:16.980
My favorite one looks like an underwater coral reef,

51
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.020
particularly the feature in the middle has almost

52
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.520
perfect. Three fold symmetry. And with things coming off,

53
00:04:26.521 --> 00:04:31.500
it's 120 degrees apart. I showed this to my colleague, Andre,

54
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.020
who said something almost as a throwaway remark,

55
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.920
which helped us solve the whole problem. He said,

56
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.400
could it be oxide rather than metal?

57
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.340
So then I began thinking, when you hit the buyer,

58
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.720
you would expect it to melt in the middle because the outside can lose heat.

59
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.400
So the center should be hotter,

60
00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.420
but we were heating it in air.

61
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.880
So perhaps the surface of the metal was burning

62
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.500
and forming oxide.

63
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.770
Then of course it would be hotter on the outside because of the chemical

64
00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:14.604
reaction.

65
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.470
So I looked at the melting point of molybdenum oxides,

66
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.500
both the oxides, molybdenum dioxide,

67
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.060
and molybdenum trioxide have melting points that are nearly a

68
00:05:27.061 --> 00:05:31.980
thousand degrees lower than that, of molybdenum metal.

69
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.620
So what that means is if you form oxide,

70
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.850
it could melt way below the temperature at which the metal would melt.

71
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.380
So the metal would be solid and the liquid would be on top.

72
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.630
The other thing is that the density of the oxide

73
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.040
is about half that if the density of the metal.

74
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.230
So if you form the oxide,

75
00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.470
you will get a bigger volume of liquid than the volume of the metal that you

76
00:06:00.471 --> 00:06:01.304
burn.

77
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.020
So you get more liquid than you might expect just from melting.

78
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.550
And because the micrograph soap, the tip was all frothy.

79
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.430
It's probably gone even lower density, which is why they suddenly appear so big.

80
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.160
It turns out that droplets forming in a regular space

81
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.280
are quite a well-known phenomenon.

82
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.500
You see it in all sorts of circumstances. If you take a tap,

83
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.480
force it for the Americans and start water going quite

84
00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:37.730
fast, and then gradually turn it off.

85
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.080
You will suddenly find the stream of liquid will break up into series of

86
00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:42.920
droplets.

87
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.570
And this is just the same effect as we're seeing here with the wire.

88
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:52.700
Then of course, what we have to do is to test is it molybdenum oxide?

89
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.760
So with our new samples,

90
00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.950
Neil went back to the nanotechnology center where as well as taking the

91
00:07:00.951 --> 00:07:01.850
pictures,

92
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.620
they can do an elemental analysis on the electron

93
00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:11.090
microscope. So you can look at different areas of the surface.

94
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.570
Hi, come in. Well,

95
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.340
what do we got? And lo and behold,

96
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.400
where there was one of these blobs,

97
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.750
the surface had oxygen in it, as well as molybdenum,

98
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.770
but where there were no blobs,

99
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.330
there was very little oxygen, not none, but very much less.

100
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.880
So the theory looked really quite good, but when you have a theory,

101
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:45.530
you need to test your theory or your hypothesis with a

102
00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:46.364
prediction.

103
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:51.530
So I predicted that if we heated the way and the vacuum,

104
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.610
when there's no way as, so the molybdenum couldn't burn,

105
00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.430
we shouldn't get the Angelos.

106
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.440
So Neil got one of his sophisticated vacuum

107
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.730
chambers with a window and we started heating the wire

108
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:13.370
and we got amazingly bright light sort of

109
00:08:13.371 --> 00:08:14.630
super light about.

110
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:27.880
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

111
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.400
<v 2>Super, super bro. I'm turning everything down on the camera.</v>

112
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.910
I think Nick was impressed. He's going to go and get the, uh,

113
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.380
the device so we can measure that.

114
00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.370
<v 1>The way I got hotter and hotter and hotter,</v>

115
00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.460
but not to trace of Angela Lloyd.

116
00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:13.160
And then when everything had cooled down the way instead

117
00:09:13.161 --> 00:09:17.420
of being black was shiny, like you would expect to metal.

118
00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:19.820
So not only did it,

119
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.960
so the oxygen was needed to form the Angelos,

120
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.820
but it also showed that oxygen was attacking the surface and making

121
00:09:28.821 --> 00:09:31.490
oxide layers. So just heating it up,

122
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.290
drove off whatever muck there was on the surface and left a really nice clean

123
00:09:36.291 --> 00:09:39.710
piece of molybdenum wire. Also when Neil opened the chamber,

124
00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:43.610
there was clearly a very thin film that evaporated,

125
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:48.590
and you could tell it was thin because it had a rainbow of colors

126
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:54.080
and you get these colors by diffraction of light, by very thin films,

127
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:58.130
because it went to such a high temperature that molybdenum was

128
00:09:58.131 --> 00:10:02.540
evaporating. It didn't have to boil because the pressure was low,

129
00:10:02.541 --> 00:10:07.490
but some of the molybdenum vapor was coming off and it hit the cold surface and

130
00:10:07.491 --> 00:10:11.510
condensed. The important message is that this experiment,

131
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:16.640
which began really as a fun experiment with a piece of molybdenum has not

132
00:10:16.641 --> 00:10:21.470
only made this think and understand something about heating

133
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.620
wires and air that we hadn't really thought about before,

134
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.190
but it has given us these amazing pictures.

135
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:33.800
And my favorite one is free to download in the description

136
00:10:33.801 --> 00:10:34.634

137
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.540
<v 0>So we've been going deep with our molybdenum wire,</v>

138
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:41.420
