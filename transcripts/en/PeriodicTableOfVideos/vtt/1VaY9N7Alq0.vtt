00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:08.690
<v 0>Did you.</v>

2
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.350
<v 1>You make a goodness on in this area?</v>

3
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:13.603
<v 2>Yes. Yes.</v>

4
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.410
[inaudible] we made all super heavy nucleus,

5
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:22.670
P E P.

6
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.483
<v 0>Um.</v>

7
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.460
<v 2>North pole and South pole. Yes.</v>

8
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.600
And the chamber between at [inaudible].

9
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.190
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

10
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.970
<v 2>Actually,</v>

11
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.530
this is so-called U 400 because the dye me close the poll is

12
00:00:54.531 --> 00:00:59.510
200 centimeters. The iron source is hops too highly charged your,

13
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.510
either injected the vertical direction,

14
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.440
coming into the [inaudible] shoes.

15
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.910
The magnet into the chamber is extraction point over there.

16
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.350
And the beam Cami's this way. This is magnetic lenses,

17
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.040
which look like the optical layer is just to focus the beam.

18
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.730
And Dipo Margaret like that one for deviation and the separate piece.

19
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:31.663
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.870
<v 1>This is a really historic Relic.</v>

21
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.220
This is from the time that the Institute moved to here to Duke now.

22
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.450
And what's really interesting is to look at the heaviest element,

23
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.950
which is number 104, which in that time in Russia was called,

24
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.930
what was the name? Goodrich?

25
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.890
The heaviest elements was number 104,

26
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.780
which was called culture tourism. It's now called rather gym.

27
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.970
<v 2>But that was before the you pack.</v>

28
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.900
<v 1>Work in Korea.</v>

29
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.790
And I really like to see there's an old periodic table and the fact that

30
00:02:10.791 --> 00:02:15.470
it's radioactive nearby and you can't even go near it is really exciting.

31
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.680
And of course, I'm next to URI. Again, this young,

32
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.580
the personification of element 118,

33
00:02:22.581 --> 00:02:27.380
the heaviest element again, this song. So what's a better combination.

34
00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:28.214
Could one have.

35
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.910
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

36
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.560
<v 1>We're now on the top of the accelerator that was used</v>

37
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.480
to make the super heavy elements, including a goodness song.

38
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.310
And this is the place where the project tale,

39
00:02:52.311 --> 00:02:56.390
the calcium 48 with injected into the

40
00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.430
accelerator course.

41
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.480
Big calcium is in the little oven inside here at

42
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:12.430
600 degrees centigrade.

43
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.920
And it comes in and you're using about one milligram each hour.

44
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.710
We were told one minute, go back to

45
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.230
Kelsey. Mine goes about five or six meters altogether from

46
00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:32.350
here. Then it gets into the accelerator.

47
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.680
Then they speed it up to 10th of the speed of light.

48
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.420
And then they go off down the beam line

49
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.910
into the chamber where the target is and the beam line

50
00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:50.770
is designed. So you get the maximum number of calcium Mayans to go through it.

51
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.900
So the really exciting thing is none of this has been shown before

52
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.290
on video. So you're the first to see it.

53
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.560
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

54
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.520
<v 1>So we're now in the area where the elements are created.</v>

55
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.790
So the big accelerator,

56
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.350
the cyclotron is behind that ball and the irons

57
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.060
come down. This pipe. The key part now is the target,

58
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.193
the target,

59
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.330
which is radiated where the two atoms come together

60
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.770
and fuse to make the new elements. But first of all,

61
00:04:58.771 --> 00:05:03.750
let's look at the target. This is the wheel for the target. Exactly. I mean,

62
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.330
each consistent resection.

63
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.270
You have this one on the shirt and people are making targets section by section

64
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.220
one section picks one week. This target is titanium,

65
00:05:17.221 --> 00:05:19.290
foil one-and-a-half microbes.

66
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.460
And then you put a layer of the kingdom or

67
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.040
[inaudible] to one micron. So you put backing for 1.5 micron,

68
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.840
does the beam go through the titanium first, the site of three periods?

69
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.730
So the beam goes through the titanium and then onto the big helium layer,

70
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.190
which is freeze so that any ions or atoms that

71
00:05:50.191 --> 00:05:53.610
are formed can go straight out without any hindrance.

72
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.790
The wheel is going to run really fast, much faster than a CD,

73
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.070
and it's going round very rapidly so that no

74
00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:08.420
particular spot on the target heats up too much because of the energy of the

75
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:11.150
beam. This is a target,

76
00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.190
a windows of titanium that separates the high vacuum

77
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.320
of the cyclotron from the hydrogen atmosphere that is

78
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.150
around the target itself.

79
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.500
You can see that the beam really eats in to the window.

80
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.230
So it goes to this bright purple color.

81
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.550
But if you look at a new set of windows that are clean and silver,

82
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.460
This is where the elements are born.

83
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:45.280
You have to imagine the targets that we've just seen inside here,

84
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.080
but in a box,

85
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.910
the plastic outside is a sort of fume cupboard to pump

86
00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:55.630
away any radio active gas or anything like that.

87
00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.610
But inside is the rapidly rotating target every so often.

88
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.140
And it's really quite rare.

89
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.280
One of the atoms of the new element is formed.

90
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:11.500
And then that atom starts off down this tube towards the

91
00:07:11.501 --> 00:07:12.334
detector.

92
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.410
This is the place where we detect the new

93
00:07:17.411 --> 00:07:21.070
elements and it's the end of the journey for the atom.

94
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:26.290
So the atom comes down this tube and into the detector here,

95
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:31.570
the detector is a solid plate and the atom hits it and sits in the

96
00:07:31.571 --> 00:07:36.070
solid and its decay is detected electrically.

97
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:42.010
And by watching how the element decays you

98
00:07:42.011 --> 00:07:46.510
can then get evidence what it is because you can see it forming

99
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:51.880
daughter and granddaughter great-granddaughter elements and all of

100
00:07:51.881 --> 00:07:54.250
those elements that already known.

101
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.910
So you can then work out that you've really got a new element.

102
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.650
And the decay is nearly always by emission of alpha

103
00:08:02.651 --> 00:08:06.820
particles. It's a doubly charged helium nucleus.

104
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:11.410
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

105
00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:15.790
<v 1>Really very moving thing here because in this operator's</v>

106
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:20.500
six new elements were created and

107
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:22.203
Eureka, again,

108
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.800
explained to me that they just put this together with pieces that they had ran

109
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.310
the lamp. And it wasn't something that was specially built.

110
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.410
They assembled it.

111
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.850
And it's been running for 7,000 hours every year for many,

112
00:08:36.851 --> 00:08:39.550
many years and produce six elements.

113
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:45.663
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

114
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:52.030
<v 1>You'll still have plenty left in the final nucleus and</v>

115
00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:56.740
calcium 48 has been the absolute key to the success

116
00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.430
of these sentences of these super heavy elements in Duke. Now.
