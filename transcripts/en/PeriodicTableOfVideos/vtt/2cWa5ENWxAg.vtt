00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.030
<v 0>Ever since the start of periodic videos,</v>

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.770
I wanted the Kips operators that sits on the windows,

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.620
still in my office to be used for video.

4
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.540
<v 1>This is it right here. Now that's been cleaned up. It was covered in dust.</v>

5
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.850
It was actually a Kips operators. K I P P a apostrophe S.

6
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.590
<v 0>Now Kips operators is a piece of operators that was very</v>

7
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.240
important in past times, but now it's never used.

8
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.040
<v 1>A chap called Kip, actually invented this back in the 18 hundreds.</v>

9
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.630
<v 0>And it was used for generating gases,</v>

10
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.160
carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrogen.

11
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.800
And sometimes I believe sulfur dioxide.

12
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.220
<v 1>Because then they didn't have handy things like gas cylinders that got delivered</v>

13
00:00:49.221 --> 00:00:53.420
by, um, companies. So they had to generate the gas as they needed it.

14
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.630
<v 0>In this machine, in the middle globe,</v>

15
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.850
you put a solid material in this case, calcium carbonate,

16
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.820
which will react with an acid to give carbon dioxide.

17
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.320
<v 1>And at the bottom, we're going to fill this with dilute acid. In this case,</v>

18
00:01:09.321 --> 00:01:12.800
we're going to use hydrochloric acid, two moles per decimeter,

19
00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:16.280
cubed concentration. So in order to get this into the bottom,

20
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.780
without it touching the middle part, we actually fill it from the top bulb.

21
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.690
And if I just take it out,

22
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.610
you can see that the glass tapers and actually take

23
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.990
out all the way. And actually, if I turn it,

24
00:01:29.991 --> 00:01:32.600
you can see it's got a hole at the bottom.

25
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.090
And that enables us to bypass the middle bowl

26
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.300
and allow the asset to get all the way to the bottom. So we've stopped it.

27
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.910
<v 0>In the top.</v>

28
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.100
You pour in hydrochloric acid and the acid goes down the tube

29
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.110
into the bottom and then comes upwards and reacts with the calcium

30
00:01:54.111 --> 00:01:56.480
carbonate to make carbon dioxide.

31
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.050
<v 1>So at the moment, there's not quite enough acid.</v>

32
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.160
So I'm going to close that valve, get a little bit more acid in that.

33
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:14.623
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

34
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.823
<v 1>Okay.</v>

35
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.300
I'll open the valve just to get the liquid

36
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.790
into contact with the chips. Like so close the valve again,

37
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.700
we've got enough acid. It's come into contact with the chips,

38
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.560
calcium carbonate dust. That's what you're seeing leaching into the HCL,

39
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.270
but that's fine because all that's going to do is generate our product,

40
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.040
which should be the water, the calcium chloride and the CO2 gas.

41
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.420
<v 0>If you have the outlet, tap closed, the carbon dioxide,</v>

42
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.400
which is a gas is generated, but it can't escape. So as it's made,

43
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.760
the pressure goes up and up and up as it goes up,

44
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.700
it pushes the liquid down the acid down, back down where it came from,

45
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.300
where it came from. So it goes down and some of it goes up to the tube,

46
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.950
to the belt in the top. When it goes down, of course,

47
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.760
it's no longer in contact with the solid. So the reaction stops.

48
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.280
If you didn't have this liquid going down,

49
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.270
then the pressure would just build up and up and up.

50
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.830
And you have an explosion.

51
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.490
<v 2>Neil.</v>

52
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.780
<v 0>As a rather nice little demonstration based on the same reaction,</v>

53
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.140
which shows what happens. If you'd let the pressure build up,

54
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.090
it's a little plastic bag that contains calcium carbonate and

55
00:03:39.091 --> 00:03:43.650
acid. And when you break the seal and mix the acid in the carbonate,

56
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.140
the plastic bag expands and suddenly goes off with an enormous

57
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.183
bag.

58
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.570
<v 2>With capes.</v>

59
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.370
<v 0>This doesn't happen because the pressure pushes the</v>

60
00:04:02.371 --> 00:04:07.320
acid away and the reaction stops. So it's a beautifully controlled reaction.

61
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.420
<v 1>You can see the, the, the model, which was,</v>

62
00:04:09.421 --> 00:04:12.630
which was submerged just now they're being exposed.

63
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.390
<v 0>When you open the tap, the pressure goes down,</v>

64
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.300
the acid comes up and generates more gas.

65
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.280
So you keep on getting gas until the acid runs

66
00:04:23.281 --> 00:04:25.380
out. Or the solid is all digital.

67
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.370
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

68
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.250
<v 1>Let's see if we've made some CO2 open the tap and watch what happens.</v>

69
00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.480
We've now put the pipette so that it's submerged.

70
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.040
The tip of it is submerged inside that solution. Now that is copper sulfate.

71
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.180
So if we put the CO2 in, assuming it is CO2 that we're making,

72
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.290
then that will bubble through and we should get a precipitate about typing the

73
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.230
tap now. So you can see there's the hole there. As soon as I twist it,

74
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.350
that hole will allow, um, the gas to pass through.

75
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.860
<v 0>So now we've got this keeps operators working.</v>

76
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.430
It's important to show you that we're really making come dioxide.

77
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.960
So you need the good test.

78
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.530
And I wanted to have a test which also looked colorful.

79
00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:34.770
So you'd have a nice video that would give you pleasure.

80
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.690
So I suggested to Sam, a series of transition metals, souls,

81
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.700
which should give precipitates really nice colored combinates

82
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.530
CO2. Plus a transition metal gives an insoluble carbonate. We've got.

83
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.850
<v 1>Other metals, salt solutions, try the copper sulfate.</v>

84
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.880
If it would have gone by now, if it was due to go,

85
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:05.540
I don't know why it's not working. This is science and action for you.

86
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.760
So we're going to take it out.

87
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.320
What's put it in the ledge Knight tree.

88
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.590
<v 0>So Simon Neil made that the solutions</v>

89
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.790
and they didn't work. What went wrong.

90
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.620
I sat there watching the guests was bubbling through and nothing changed. Well,

91
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.630
either I got the chemistry wrong or they made the solutions wrong.

92
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.910
<v 1>I think it's just doing this because.</v>

93
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.620
<v 0>It hates me, I guess, probably I got the chemistry wrong. So in the end,</v>

94
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.100
because they have good chemical knowledge themselves,

95
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.580
they went for the classic test for carbon dioxide,

96
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.750
which is line water line water is the solution of calcium

97
00:06:52.751 --> 00:06:57.700
hydroxide, which reacts with CO2 to make calcium carbonate.

98
00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.400
In fact, the solid that they started with.

99
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.490
<v 1>There you go straight away. You can see it. That's brilliant.</v>

100
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:08.740
It's definitely CRJ. Fantastic.

101
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.930
<v 0>Of course, because they thought of the right thing to do. It worked perfectly.</v>
