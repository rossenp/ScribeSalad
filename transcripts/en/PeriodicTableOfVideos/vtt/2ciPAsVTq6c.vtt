00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.340
<v 0>Element 41 is niobium and I'd never seen</v>

2
00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:09.570
niobium until recently. And then I was lent a metal.

3
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.460
I haven't won the metal,

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.680
but it is a metal that is given each year to somebody who's made a real

5
00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:21.390
contribution to the field of niobium chemistry or niobium science.

6
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.350
The metal is made out of niobium. So look carefully.

7
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.110
This is metallic niobium.

8
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.080
I can't remember who won it last year,

9
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.690
but it has been won by a series of people,

10
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.820
mostly in the field of metallic energy.

11
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.900
And I'll explain why it's mortality rather than chemistry. In a minute,

12
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.860
I gave you that one professor, I was lent this by the, um,

13
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.690
company CBMM,

14
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.610
which awards this metal and together with the Institute

15
00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:55.530
of materials and minerals, it is named after Charles Hatchett,

16
00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.360
who was the English scientist who discovered niobium or discovered the

17
00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:04.620
element initially. And it's really quite interesting.

18
00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:07.230
It was at the beginning of the 19th century,

19
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.760
just after the idea of elements had been published.

20
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.350
So everybody was looking for elements and Charles Hatchett looked at a

21
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:20.730
mineral which had been in a museum in London for quite a long time,

22
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.620
a mineral that came from America and he discovered a new element.

23
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.900
And because it came from America,

24
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.800
he called it Columbia them because Columbia,

25
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.700
isn't the Latin name that is often used for America.

26
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.290
And I think the name Columbian sounds really beautiful.

27
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.300
<v 1>Normally really opposed to naming elements after countries.</v>

28
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.230
<v 0>Well,</v>

29
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.550
I think it's quite nice when it's named by somebody who doesn't come from that

30
00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:52.910
country, then it's a genuine honor,

31
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.150
rather than a patriotic gesture. And of course,

32
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.100
England had just lost the American colonies. So it was particularly,

33
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:02.960
um, nice gesture.

34
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.190
Hatchett unfortunately didn't continue as a chemist.

35
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.840
And he worked in a company that made courages,

36
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.290
I suppose, the modern equivalent of a sports car company.

37
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.480
And later in his career, he focused on the carriages rather than on the science.

38
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.040
The element was then rediscovered in Germany and named

39
00:02:25.041 --> 00:02:29.730
niobium. There was a problem because the Americans called it Columbia,

40
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.640
the Europeans called it niobium and there was all sorts of trade-off.

41
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.850
It was agreed.

42
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.160
The Americans would call it niobium if the Germans and the

43
00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:43.340
Europeans would call Wolf from tungsten.

44
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.290
So everybody was happy,

45
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.870
but niobium is actually a relatively abandoned at

46
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.980
element compared to many of the metals. And the by far,

47
00:02:54.981 --> 00:02:58.940
the biggest deposit is in Brazil where this

48
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.450
CBMM is a mining company that digs niobium out to the ground.

49
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.520
Now the main use for niobium at the moment is in strengthening steel

50
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.590
steel for making bridges steel, for making cars steel,

51
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:19.330
for making pipelines that you use for high pressure gas, like natural gas.

52
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.570
So imagine this piece of paper is steel.

53
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.570
If the steel was just a single crystal, if you put a force on it,

54
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:31.840
like my pulling here, it would be very strong,

55
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.000
but actually the steel consists of small

56
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.110
so-called grains, rather like small crystals.

57
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.050
The boundary between the grains is a weak point.

58
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.090
So let me illustrate that by tearing the paper a bit.

59
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.770
Now you can see if I pull again, when there's this weak point,

60
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.170
it just pulls apart very easily.

61
00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.270
So the grain boundaries is what causes the failure and the

62
00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:04.390
pipe bursts. If you don't make it thick enough,

63
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.560
if you add just a tiny bit of niobium to the steel,

64
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.050
less than 0.1 of a percent, less than one part in a thousand,

65
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.200
the niobium concentrates along the grain boundary

66
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.970
and strengthens it. Let me show you an analogy again.

67
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.950
So here we've got, uh,

68
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.970
two grains and you can see this weak point in between,

69
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.670
but now if you imagine the

70
00:04:36.671 --> 00:04:40.330
niobium across this green boundary,

71
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.860
it forms a block so that when you pull it

72
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.810
it's much stronger and it doesn't break. I'm pulling really hard.

73
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.360
What this means is that if you add a small amount of niobium to

74
00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:57.970
your pipe, to the steel that you make your pipe,

75
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.230
you can put a lot more gas through the same pipe.

76
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.280
There's a pipe in China, which is 8,000 kilometers long.

77
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.620
And by adding some by opium and making the pipe a little

78
00:05:11.621 --> 00:05:14.140
heavier one and a quarter times heavier,

79
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.030
you can take two and a half times as much gas down the same pipe in

80
00:05:19.031 --> 00:05:19.864
cars,

81
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.280
the cars in developed countries like the U S and in Europe,

82
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.710
they add about 200 grams of niobium to the steel that makes up

83
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:30.544
the car.

84
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.650
And that saves a hundred kilos of weight of steel in that car.

85
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.680
It's almost the weight of a whole passenger.

86
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.140
And so then when you're driving every hundred

87
00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:48.850
kilometers or so that you drive that saves one or two liters of petrol,

88
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.820
depending how aggressively you drive.

89
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.180
<v 2>Professor, how does adeno BIA make the car lighter?</v>

90
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.270
<v 0>Wait, it makes the car lighter because the seal steel is stronger.</v>

91
00:05:59.271 --> 00:06:03.410
So you don't need so much steel to make the same strength car.

92
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.500
<v 3>But you said the pipe was made heavier in China. That's because of other things,</v>

93
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.660
right?

94
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.030
<v 0>Well, you made it heavier by little bit,</v>

95
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.750
and then you could take twice as much gas in it, in the car.

96
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.040
You just want to take the same number of passengers so you can make it lighter

97
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.350
and take the same number of passengers.

98
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.180
It's quite difficult to put just a small amount of niobium

99
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.840
into the steel.

100
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.700
It's rather like adding just the grain or two. So you're cooking.

101
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.980
So in fact, the producers of niobium produce a material,

102
00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:40.720
which is called Fera niobium,

103
00:06:40.721 --> 00:06:45.430
which is a mixture of iron and niobium of which I've got some

104
00:06:45.431 --> 00:06:50.380
pieces here. It looks a bit black if you crack it open.

105
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:56.470
And so this is the material that is added to the mix when people are making

106
00:06:56.471 --> 00:06:57.550
steel. Well,

107
00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:02.230
I believe that some just in America still call it

108
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.920
Colombian. And I think that's rather nice,

109
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.480
but it's not used as the name in chemistry.

110
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.741
And in fact,

111
00:07:11.741 --> 00:07:16.630
I think most chemists will no longer have even know the name

112
00:07:16.631 --> 00:07:18.250
existed. I liked it.

113
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:23.080
It rolls off the tongue so much nicer than some of the modern names for elements

114
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.210
that recently discovered ones.

115
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.610
But it's also good because it reminds one of the history.

116
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:36.700
And I think the discovery of niobium or Columbian

117
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:41.800
in the sample in the museum is a very good reason why we need to

118
00:07:41.801 --> 00:07:43.720
preserve things in museums.

119
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:48.640
Because very often scientists who come later can

120
00:07:48.641 --> 00:07:52.570
discover things that the people who originally collected the samples would never

121
00:07:52.571 --> 00:07:57.010
have. Trent told the person who originally collected the sample

122
00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:01.720
where now European was discovered, didn't know the elements existed.

123
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:06.730
So there was the sample just waiting for the

124
00:08:06.731 --> 00:08:08.380
future scientists to discover that.

125
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.833
<v 3>All right. Yeah.</v>

126
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.790
<v 0>So the other application for niobium is in the alloy with</v>

127
00:08:21.791 --> 00:08:26.770
tin, which makes so-called superconducting wire,

128
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:33.100
some wires, when you cool it down to very low temperature,

129
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.650
lose all their electrical resistance.

130
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:40.750
So you can put through a very big current without heating up because the heat

131
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:45.100
generated by an electric current is related to the resistance.

132
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.220
If the resistance is zero, no heating,

133
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:53.590
this means that you can make very small and very powerful magnets,

134
00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.690
such a used for magnetic resonance imaging.

135
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.140
And for some sorts of accelerators,

136
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:05.490
like the large Hadron Collider at CERN niobium

137
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:09.300
again has a really quite important metallurgical role.

138
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.130
I'm not a physicist.

139
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:16.110
I'm not sure exactly why it is that niobium tin has these

140
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:21.120
superconducting properties, but they only happen at very low temperature.

141
00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:25.770
So you need liquid helium to cool them right down before you see

142
00:09:25.771 --> 00:09:26.790
this behavior.
