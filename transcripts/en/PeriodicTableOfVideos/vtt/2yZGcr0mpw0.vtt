1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.800
<v 0>We have had lots and lots of requests to make videos about Thor.</v>

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.040
Rim people get really excited about Thor rim.

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.270
We delayed making the video until we had the sample of Thorim

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.720
and our friend max Whitby,

5
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.370
who makes nice samples of elements has told us on many

6
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:24.930
occasions that Thorim is the hardest element to get hold of.

7
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.431
<v 1>Well,</v>

8
00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:29.930
one of the problems with sorghum is simply obtaining it and there are now very,

9
00:00:29.931 --> 00:00:32.360
very few places in the world where you can buy any, um,

10
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.730
even laboratory suppliers don't sell it.

11
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.430
<v 0>Finally, just before Christmas,</v>

12
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.320
he gave us a sample and here is the sample.

13
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.000
This is a sample of two bits of Thorim

14
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:51.050
wire. Now you can see the first problem with Thorim is the

15
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.920
radioactive, so you can't post it.

16
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.500
I've no idea how the sample got to London.

17
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.420
It was brought to me in London in Max's bag,

18
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.240
and I brought it to Nottingham in my pocket.

19
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.610
Now there's no danger bringing it in my pocket because it's got a very thick

20
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.410
piece of plastic and 3m gives out relatively

21
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.240
weak radioactivity. So there is no radioactivity outside.

22
00:01:20.241 --> 00:01:24.560
This Thorim as an element is not very widely

23
00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:25.394
used.

24
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.310
It used to be used for the elements in

25
00:01:31.311 --> 00:01:34.040
gas fires to get to good fire.

26
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.990
You have some sort of ceramic element which gets hot and radiates the heat

27
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.840
because flames don't radiate heat very much.

28
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.750
And Thorim oxide is very stable.

29
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.890
So people use ceramics based on thorium oxide.

30
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.480
But the reason that people get excited about Thorim is because of nuclear

31
00:01:53.481 --> 00:01:55.820
reactors, nuclear reactors,

32
00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.710
the two most widely used in the world of based on uranium.

33
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.420
You remember that different radioactive elements can have circled

34
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.470
isotopes. These are chemically identical atoms,

35
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.730
but which have different numbers of neutrons. And the uranium isotope,

36
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.020
which is used in nuclear reactors is uranium two, three, five,

37
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.910
which when it is hit by neutrons can split giving out more

38
00:02:22.911 --> 00:02:26.960
neutrons and you get to chain reaction in a nuclear reactor.

39
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.640
You want the reaction to go nice and slowly to keep the thing hot.

40
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.730
So you can turn water into steam and generate a.

41
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:35.840
<v 1>She says to us,</v>

42
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.700
we obtain a constantly increasing number of fissions called a chain

43
00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:41.534
reaction.

44
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.990
<v 0>If you're building an atom bomb, a nuclear weapon,</v>

45
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.100
you want all your uranium to go bang at the same moment.

46
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.650
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

47
00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.640
<v 0>With current nuclear technology is first all that potentially.</v>

48
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.300
There's a shortage of uranium. It's a very rare element,

49
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.770
equally important.

50
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.480
You can use the uranium in the reactor,

51
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.500
the uranium two, three eight, which is the isotope that doesn't take pots in.

52
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:19.150
The reaction can be used to absorb neutrons and make plutonium,

53
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.030
which can then be used for nuclear weapons.

54
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.000
So if you build a reactor somewhere,

55
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.340
there is a danger that the waste product from that reactor or

56
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.330
some of the waste products could be used for making nuclear bombs.

57
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.940
<v 2>The items of the metals,</v>

58
00:03:35.941 --> 00:03:40.800
uranium and plutonium can be most readily pressuring them to cause

59
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:41.810
nuclear explosion.

60
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.710
<v 0>And everybody in the world generally agrees that we have to try and reduce the</v>

61
00:03:46.711 --> 00:03:51.090
number of bombs rather than making it easier for people to make more bonds

62
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.940
[inaudible] can be used for a completely different approach to nuclear

63
00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.750
reactors, but which still involves uranium.

64
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.790
The most abundant isotope of Thorim is still rim two, three,

65
00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:10.530
two. If this isotope absorbs a neutron,

66
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.090
it becomes Storium two, three, three is maskers up in one.

67
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.040
Then sequentially two of the neutrons split into

68
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.990
the proton and electron.

69
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.550
And so it goes jumps from Thor rim to protect tenure to

70
00:04:26.551 --> 00:04:30.960
uranium. So you generate uranium two, three, three,

71
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.250
uranium two, three,

72
00:04:32.251 --> 00:04:36.420
three is a very rare isotope of uranium,

73
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.600
but you can breed it from the Thorim,

74
00:04:39.601 --> 00:04:42.930
which you've got to lots of and the uranium two, three,

75
00:04:42.931 --> 00:04:47.220
three can then do your nuclear reaction break apart,

76
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.940
give you energy just like the other uranium isotopes.

77
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.950
But the difference is the T can't produce plutonium and

78
00:04:55.951 --> 00:05:00.720
therefore it cannot be used to make bombs. Of course you can say, well,

79
00:05:00.721 --> 00:05:03.390
if it splits in the nuclear reactor,

80
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.040
why can't you make a bomb out of uranium? Two, three, three?

81
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.070
And the answer is in principle, you could,

82
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.150
but as a byproduct of all the nuclear processes,

83
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.300
you'll also get uranium to three, two,

84
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.790
and uranium to three.

85
00:05:20.791 --> 00:05:24.660
Two is a showstopper it's absorbs neutrons and stops

86
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.270
uranium exploding like a bomb. So it's safe in that way.

87
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.250
The other advantage of Thorim is that it's more abundant in the earth.

88
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.620
And because Thorim two, three,

89
00:05:37.621 --> 00:05:42.330
two is the principle isotope compared to

90
00:05:42.331 --> 00:05:45.510
uranium two, three, five, which is only a small amount.

91
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.580
There is an awful lot more 3m that could be used in reactors in the

92
00:05:50.581 --> 00:05:52.860
world than there is uranium.

93
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.770
<v 2>Except you use a nuclear reactor to produce phenomenal of heat.</v>

94
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.480
<v 0>The disadvantage is that you need to have some</v>

95
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:04.700
neutrons to get things started.

96
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.710
You have to have a nuclear reaction to produce neutrons so that

97
00:06:09.711 --> 00:06:11.570
your thrill room will turn into uranium.

98
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.640
But that also can be quite an advantage because for example,

99
00:06:16.641 --> 00:06:21.620
you can put waste plutonium mixed with Ethereum and you

100
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:26.090
burn up the plutonium and you get more fuel sort of breeding

101
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:29.480
reactor, the stability of thorium oxide.

102
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.880
The one that was exploited years ago in gas fires is both an

103
00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:36.860
advantage and a disadvantage.

104
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.970
It's an advantage because your fuel is very stable.

105
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.650
The downside with Storium dioxide being so stable is that you have to heat it to

106
00:06:45.651 --> 00:06:48.890
a very high temperature to process it.

107
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.720
And that's not easy.

108
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.820
Relatively little work has been done on Thorim reactors compared

109
00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.710
to the now 70 years or more nearly eight years of

110
00:07:00.711 --> 00:07:04.100
research that had been done on uranium,

111
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.210
plutonium reactors, and therefore the engineering,

112
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.980
the safety and so on is not developed to the same level and the costs

113
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:18.110
of building full-size Thorim reactors would be very considerable.

114
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.910
<v 3>It sounds like if all things being equal and we could start again,</v>

115
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.670
you would advocate going down the Storium route and we're,

116
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.360
we're only doing uranium plutonium route because we've been doing it for so

117
00:07:28.361 --> 00:07:29.170
long.

118
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:33.940
<v 0>Well, you have to remember that uranium</v>

119
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:38.650
plutonium route started because of the Manhattan

120
00:07:38.651 --> 00:07:42.370
project, the atomic bomb project.

121
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.470
I suspect that if nuclear power had been just

122
00:07:47.471 --> 00:07:50.020
started for civilian use,

123
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:55.240
that the cost would have been prohibitive and people might never have used

124
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.110
nuclear power.

125
00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.150
So it is built on the legacy of

126
00:08:01.151 --> 00:08:05.920
the weapons programs in many of the major countries in the world.

127
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:11.050
We now have the situation where we understand how to handle

128
00:08:11.051 --> 00:08:12.580
radioactive compounds.

129
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:17.740
We don't understand entirely how to deal with the waste in practical

130
00:08:17.741 --> 00:08:19.510
terms that we do in principle.

131
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.820
So it would be much more feasible now to go on the Thor REM cycle

132
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.760
than it would have been in the 1940s.
