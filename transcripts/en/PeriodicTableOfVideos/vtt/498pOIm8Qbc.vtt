00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.560
<v 0>It's an exciting time.</v>

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.810
The new horizons space probe is flying past Pluto

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.510
and the astronomers wild with excitement, new canyons,

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.700
all sorts of things on Pluto,

5
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.490
binary excited for different reason because new horizons

6
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.500
is carrying plutonium.

7
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.870
So the element plutonium is going to the planet. Pluto,

8
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.950
how much better can you get than that? The three elements,

9
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.990
uranium neptunium and plutonium were named

10
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.080
after the three planets in those days,

11
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.340
Pluto was still considered to be a planet.

12
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.210
So uranium had been called uranium for a long time.

13
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.950
And when they discovered the new elements, 93 and 94,

14
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.850
it was natural to call them after Neptune and Pluto.

15
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.890
The reason why the new horizons has plutonium

16
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.090
on it is because they need energy.

17
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.790
Usually spacecraft that are near the earth,

18
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.260
or even a bit further away on Mars have large

19
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.360
arrays of solar panels,

20
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.860
like the PV panels that some people have on their houses, but of course,

21
00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:22.020
much lighter and more efficient.

22
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.070
And they just use the sunlight to generate

23
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.340
electricity. But when you get to Pluto,

24
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.410
it's far too far away from the sun to get useful amounts of light.

25
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.170
In fact, if you stood on Pluto,

26
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.500
the sun would just look like a rather large star.

27
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.420
You wouldn't notice the sunlight at all or very little.

28
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.290
So you need some other sorts.

29
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.510
<v 1>Of energy and lift off of NASA's new horizons spacecraft on a decade,</v>

30
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.570
visit the planet Pluto, and then beyond by far the most.

31
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.700
<v 0>Wait effective energy source, uh, radioactive sources,</v>

32
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.080
as you know,

33
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.940
the most powerful bombs are nuclear bombs where you release all the

34
00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:14.420
energy in a fraction,

35
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.130
a tiny fraction of a second plutonium is used

36
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.020
on spacecraft to release the thermal

37
00:02:24.021 --> 00:02:27.530
energy that comes from radio active decay.

38
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.240
You have a lump or a series of pieces of the

39
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.320
isotype of plutonium plutonium two, three eight.

40
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.120
This is not the same isotope that is used for nuclear

41
00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:41.954
weapons,

42
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.130
but it is one that decays at a rather slower rate

43
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.540
spontaneously.

44
00:02:47.541 --> 00:02:51.770
You don't need neutrons to set it off and to get the chain reaction.

45
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.880
And it decays with a half-life of

46
00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.790
87.7 years. So it slowly decays away.

47
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.730
But if you have a lump of this material,

48
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.170
quite a sizable lump the energy it's producing,

49
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.990
heats it up till it's nearly red hot,

50
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.000
and then you can surround it by thermocouples,

51
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.830
which will convert the thermal energy,

52
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.330
the heat energy into electricity, or to electrical energy.

53
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.560
<v 2>How do you just turn hate into pure electrical energy?</v>

54
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.080
<v 0>Well, people are quite often familiar with thermocouples that used to measure</v>

55
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.700
temperature where you have two different metals, um,

56
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.980
in contact. And when you heat them up, you generate a small voltage,

57
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.600
which is usually put onto some sort of digital display that shows the

58
00:03:48.601 --> 00:03:52.230
temperature. However, if you have thick wires,

59
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.450
you can generate quite a reasonable current.

60
00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.640
And if you have lots of these thermal couples arranged in suitably,

61
00:04:02.641 --> 00:04:05.100
you can generate a reasonable voltage as well.

62
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.560
<v 2>So just the pure hate is shunting electrons along the way.</v>

63
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:10.650
<v 0>Yes,</v>

64
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.540
the energy that they get out for the new horizons,

65
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.050
they have 10.9 kilos of plutonium.

66
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:23.940
That's quite a serious amount of plutonium. Of course it's a different isotope,

67
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.130
but it's nearly twice as much as the plutonium that was in the atom bomb that

68
00:04:29.131 --> 00:04:32.880
destroyed Nagasaki. So it's serious amount of plutonium.

69
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.500
This 10.9 kilos is producing about

70
00:04:37.501 --> 00:04:39.270
280 Watts,

71
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.970
which is enough to light a couple of powerful light bulbs of the old salt.

72
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.450
And there's enough to power everything on the spacecraft.

73
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.660
The plutonium is decaying all the time.

74
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.970
So it's taken nine or nearly 10 years for new horizons to

75
00:04:56.971 --> 00:04:58.860
get to Pluto. And during that time,

76
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.960
the power will live decade because there is less heat coming out of the

77
00:05:03.961 --> 00:05:08.940
plutonium, but there's still enough to power all the instruments.

78
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.721
In fact,

79
00:05:09.721 --> 00:05:14.640
there was a delay launching the new horizons and that also made

80
00:05:14.641 --> 00:05:19.170
the power pack lose some of its power. If it had been on time,

81
00:05:19.171 --> 00:05:21.420
they would have had considerably more power,

82
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.740
but they have very clever power management

83
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.800
techniques. So all being well.

84
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.630
There's enough to get the great pictures back that we're looking forward to the

85
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.340
power pack, I think is quite big. And it's very carefully constructed.

86
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.060
The plutonium is in the form of plutonium oxide,

87
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.520
which is surrounded by Iridium,

88
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.290
which is the metal that has almost the highest melting point of any metal.

89
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.940
And then that is again, surrounded by graphite.

90
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.040
And the whole thing then is put in contact with thermocouples.

91
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.920
It weighs quite a large amount,

92
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.090
but in terms of kilowatt hours,

93
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.770
per kilo of weight,

94
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.900
it is fantastically better than say using petrol or

95
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.170
gasoline to power the satellite.

96
00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:19.490
So it's a very high energy density. The trial for chemistry is that,

97
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.140
well, I think physicists would claim those nuclear power.

98
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.430
So it was really theirs,

99
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:30.110
but what I really like is plutonium going to Pluto. Now,

100
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.560
obviously we don't have any plutonium here.

101
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.200
You may have seen our videos just to go in and look at a few milligrams.

102
00:06:39.201 --> 00:06:41.660
We had to dress up all the specialists. However,

103
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.460
I do have my plutonium coffee mat.

104
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.610
And in this test tube here, I have a soft drink,

105
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.680
which calls itself plutonium.

106
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.570
And what is important to say is that if this was

107
00:06:59.571 --> 00:07:02.750
really plutonium, two, three, eight oxide,

108
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:08.030
this test tube would be too hot to touch plutonium. Two,

109
00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:11.060
three eight is made synthetically.

110
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.880
It is made from uranium,

111
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.210
which is turned into neptunium element

112
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.790
93. And that element 93,

113
00:07:22.791 --> 00:07:27.470
then decays into plutonium two, three eight, if the carries up,

114
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.700
yes, it decays up because it,

115
00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:34.820
there is a BTK and emission of an electron,

116
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.980
which essentially is a neutron turning into a proton it's quite a

117
00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:41.360
difficult process to do.

118
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.190
And you need very special reactor to convert uranium to neptunium

119
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:51.200
and then get the final stage. It used to be manufactured in the United States.

120
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:56.480
They've now stopped. And the us space program bought some plutonium, two,

121
00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:57.770
three, eight from Russia,

122
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:03.050
but now even those stocks are running out and we're talking about really

123
00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:07.250
small amounts of this material, 20 kilos, something like that.

124
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:12.530
So as far as I know, there is some plutonium, two, three eight,

125
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.760
available in the States for the next Mars Rover.

126
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.090
Because for these Mars rovers,

127
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.240
the vehicles that go around Mars,

128
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.010
you can't really power them with solar panels because you'd need huge

129
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:30.860
solar panels to get enough power.

130
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:35.030
And so it really would not be able to drag all these things behind them,

131
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.070
but there is a sorted.

132
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:42.560
And there's a question is it's very expensive to make this plutonium two,

133
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:43.663
three eight.

134
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.930
And in the current time of tight budgets,

135
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.080
it's been decided it's not economic to do it.

136
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.340
<v 3>Professor. Oh, I can imagine if an element was named after.</v>

137
00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.960
<v 2>A person who was later disgraced on an international scale,</v>

138
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.190
that our you pack would consider changing the name of the element.

139
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.320
I think they would do that.

140
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:11.280
Do you think there's a case to be made for changing the name of plutonium?

141
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:16.350
Because it was named after a Grande planet and the planet was famously demoted.

142
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.720
Does that mean we should demote the element name too?

143
00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:24.020
<v 0>Definitely not because it's not Pluto's fault that</v>

144
00:09:24.021 --> 00:09:27.410
we've changed the definition. It hasn't misbehaved.

145
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:31.790
Hasn't thrown rocks at the earth or anything like that. I never,

146
00:09:31.791 --> 00:09:36.730
I think it's many people think Pluto has been pretty hard done by they'd be

147
00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:40.610
uproar if plutonium was renamed. And anyway,

148
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.190
then there'd be big arguments. What we should call it.

149
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:49.100
I think I'm very happy with the name and your suggestion is right.

150
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.660
<v 2>I think Pluto should still be a planner. Yeah.</v>
