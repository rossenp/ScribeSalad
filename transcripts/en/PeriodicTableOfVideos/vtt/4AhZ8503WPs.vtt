00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.010
<v 0>We've decided to make a new video about aluminum because it's a long</v>

2
00:00:05.011 --> 00:00:07.890
time over five years since we made the first one.

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.110
And we didn't say very much,

4
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.880
It's a surprisingly abundant element.

5
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.680
If you look at this periodic table here where the

6
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.020
area of the different elements gives you a rough idea of

7
00:00:27.021 --> 00:00:28.670
the abundance,

8
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.530
you can see that Allie minium is one of the most abundant metals up there with

9
00:00:33.531 --> 00:00:35.300
sodium magnesium and calcium,

10
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.860
more aluminum than potassium, about the same,

11
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.360
or perhaps even more than the iron. We're never going to run out of value.

12
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.533
Minium.

13
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.760
The problem with aluminum is that you don't find aluminum metal

14
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.010
in nature as a metal. It's always tied up with other compounds,

15
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.150
mostly with oxygen in clays. You know,

16
00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:03.050
what plays are the sort of muddy stuff that you get stuck on your shoes when

17
00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:07.850
it's raining to get the aluminum out of the clay that

18
00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:11.810
is to break the aluminum oxygen bonds, which are very strong,

19
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.370
requires a lot of energy, which comes from electricity.

20
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.020
So making aluminum is very energy

21
00:01:21.021 --> 00:01:21.890
intensive.

22
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.050
That's why people like to recycle aluminum because once you've got it,

23
00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:28.190
it's worth preserving,

24
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.410
but it's fantastically important because aluminum is a very light metal.

25
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.170
And it's often used as an alloy because the

26
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.250
aluminum alloys are stronger than the aluminum itself.

27
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.130
So if you're using it for, um,

28
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.280
aircraft or some other use like that,

29
00:01:49.281 --> 00:01:53.720
where you want to combine lightness with strength,

30
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.110
then the stronger you can make it the better.

31
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.510
But when it was first made in the 19th century, isolates as a metal,

32
00:02:02.511 --> 00:02:04.190
it was terrifically valuable.

33
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.110
And there are stories of the French emperor serving his honored guests

34
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.860
with Alli minium plates or aluminum cutlery,

35
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.670
while the less important people had silver or gold,

36
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.250
but those times have passed.

37
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.030
And now you can get cupcakes and things like that,

38
00:02:23.031 --> 00:02:26.420
surrounded by foil of Valley minium,

39
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.820
Allie minium is a very good metal for making things because it has a very thin

40
00:02:31.821 --> 00:02:35.300
coating of aluminium oxide on the surface,

41
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.590
which prevents it reacting with things. But as soon as that coating goes,

42
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.600
it becomes very reactive.

43
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:00.763
<v 1>[Inaudible]</v>

44
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.493
Oh,

45
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.480
I guess we're standing by for your high gain alignment for the checklist.

46
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.850
<v 0>I may have seen a video where we put copper chloride in one of these</v>

47
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.580
cupcake holders. First of all,

48
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.480
I'm going to dissolve some up and make a fairly concentrated solution.

49
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.520
I need to place this here.

50
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.230
And what came out was this,

51
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.440
or rather the copper chloride came out through the hole.

52
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.910
It starts boiling really quite nicely.

53
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.550
Now imagine I was doing this for my children who were quite small at that

54
00:03:59.551 --> 00:04:04.230
time and Bush and the aluminum was

55
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.180
completely dissolved up forming aluminum chloride and copper

56
00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:11.580
metal in my own research.

57
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.280
Aluminium is quite important. Quite a lot of our equipment uses aluminum,

58
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.920
not so much for the high pressure tubing that we use because quite a lot of

59
00:04:22.921 --> 00:04:24.930
my research involves high pressures,

60
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.270
but we use it for the metal blocks that we put round the tubing so that we can

61
00:04:30.271 --> 00:04:34.710
heat it up. Aluminum has a good electrical conductivity,

62
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.190
and it's also easy to machine.

63
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.780
This is a piece of equipment here where we have a

64
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.760
tube going down the middle. You can see the diameter of the tube here round.

65
00:04:47.761 --> 00:04:52.320
It is an aluminum block and an electrical

66
00:04:52.321 --> 00:04:54.930
heater. Now this particular case,

67
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.910
there was an accident or a mishap because the

68
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.630
thermocouple that was controlling, the temperature of this fell out.

69
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.210
So the heater got hotter and hotter and eventually the

70
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.510
aluminum melted and pull down here.

71
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.970
And I think this is really beautiful.

72
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.250
Well, fortunately I was not in the lab,

73
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.320
but I would have got very angry with my students. But I think when it happened,

74
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.110
it was quite exciting. This would have been glowing,

75
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.970
almost red because the melting point of aluminum is around 500

76
00:05:32.971 --> 00:05:37.470
degrees centigrade, but then once it formed originally,

77
00:05:37.471 --> 00:05:38.400
it was very shiny,

78
00:05:38.401 --> 00:05:43.080
but quickly to get developed the surface layer of aluminum oxide.

79
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.240
If you have fine particles of aluminum and blow them into a

80
00:05:48.241 --> 00:05:49.074
flame,

81
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.450
then they will burn quite spectacularly.

82
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.000
And you form aluminum oxide. Now on the face of it,

83
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.240
Allie monoxide sounds a rather boring compound,

84
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.330
but it's really very useful.

85
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:11.180
And we use it quite a lot in our research in all sorts of different ways.

86
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.330
It looks like a white powder, not very exciting,

87
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.400
but in our group,

88
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.480
this aluminum oxide has been a fantastic catalyst,

89
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.370
all sorts of reactions that we didn't expect have gone with this material.

90
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.600
My students keep it in the bottle, almost like a magic catalyst.

91
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.940
And I've only been given a little to show you,

92
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.330
it acts as a solid acid,

93
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.910
which can be used a very high temperature and we'll get various acid

94
00:06:40.911 --> 00:06:45.200
catalyzed reactions of organic compounds. It will make ethers.

95
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.760
We have made various alkenes and a whole series of different compounds.

96
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.520
And my students still use it very much.

97
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:57.140
If you melt the aluminum oxide, which we can't do here,

98
00:06:57.141 --> 00:07:01.970
but can be done industrially. You can make single crystals,

99
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.460
which are transparent like glass.

100
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.620
And then you can grow a single crystal tube like this one,

101
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.250
which, because it's a single crystal is terrifically strong.

102
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.150
It's the defects that make something weak.

103
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:21.740
And so if you have just one crystal there no defects.

104
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.090
And so it's very strong.

105
00:07:23.091 --> 00:07:27.680
So you can put a very high pressure inside this tube without blowing up.

106
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.900
<v 2>You could make that tube out of metal processor.</v>

107
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:35.330
<v 0>But if you have metal, then you can't see what's going on inside.</v>

108
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.770
And we are using these tubes for photochemical reactions.

109
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:44.600
So we take a light like this and

110
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.470
shine it on the chemicals, going through the tube and the high pressure.

111
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.350
And we can convert one chemical into another.

112
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:56.720
We can do this very efficiently because the light is absorbed by the molecules

113
00:07:56.721 --> 00:07:58.010
that we want to react.

114
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:03.050
And so we don't waste the energy on everything else and using LEDs,

115
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.090
which are very efficient, light source.

116
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.120
You can get a process that is very energy efficient,

117
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.630
and it all depends on having the Safa tube.

118
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.570
This is synthetic Sapphire,

119
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.150
the real Safa,

120
00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.360
the chems have impurities in them of other metals,

121
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.900
which give them the nice colors. Particularly the blue princess.

122
00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:26.510
Kate has a blue Sapphire ring,

123
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:31.640
which belonged to her husband's mother princess die before her.

124
00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:34.550
And so these are very valuable ones,

125
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:38.600
but synthetic Safa is also expensive,

126
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:42.830
but not in the same class as a natural gem.

127
00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.820
<v 2>What can nature do that? The guys at the sofa factory can.</v>

128
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:48.490
<v 0>Nature has time.</v>

129
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:54.250
The people who growing this will take hours or days,

130
00:08:54.251 --> 00:08:59.190
or perhaps weeks to grow it nature can spend thousands of

131
00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:01.950
millions of years growing a particular gym,

132
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.930
and therefore they can heat it up and cool it down in

133
00:09:06.931 --> 00:09:11.730
natural surroundings in volcano or whatever far

134
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:15.330
more slowly than people can afford to do industrially.

135
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:19.740
There's a lot of argument, whether you should call it aluminum or aluminum.

136
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.860
Now there isn't totally correct.

137
00:09:22.861 --> 00:09:25.440
One because both forms are acceptable,

138
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:30.780
but all or nearly all chemists use minium because it's

139
00:09:30.781 --> 00:09:35.430
very important to use a standardized nomenclature right across the

140
00:09:35.431 --> 00:09:39.780
world. And I think aluminum sounds nicer.

141
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.270
<v 3>My question is, is it aluminum or Allah minium?</v>

142
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.570
Cause I wouldn't know what to call my Alinea model.

143
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.630
<v 0>Apparently there was a decision in 1990 by our,</v>

144
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:54.410
you pack the instant national union in the pure and applied chemistry.

145
00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.470
The teacher would definitely be called Allie minium,

146
00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:02.180
but then they relented three years later and said,

147
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:06.200
you could use aluminum as well. But if you're a serious chemist,

148
00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:10.970
you really need to say Allie minium because otherwise people won't

149
00:10:10.971 --> 00:10:12.860
find your papers,

150
00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:16.250
your publications when they search,

151
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:19.100
because they almost certainly put an eye in the name

152
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:28.190
Minium is frequently used or used frequently to be used for.

153
00:10:28.191 --> 00:10:32.780
So spins for cooking because it's easy to make easy to

154
00:10:32.781 --> 00:10:36.620
machine. And particularly when people used electric stoves,

155
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:41.450
it was easy to make a flat bottom so that you've got good contact between the

156
00:10:41.451 --> 00:10:45.350
electric element and the saucepan.

157
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.870
The problem with aluminum saucepans is that if you're cooking some fairly

158
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:55.630
acid food, for example, boiling lemons or rhubarb,

159
00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.710
something like that, which is quite acidic,

160
00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:02.510
you can dissolve some of the aluminum and people got quite worried

161
00:11:02.511 --> 00:11:06.410
about getting aluminum in their food. Also,

162
00:11:06.411 --> 00:11:08.480
if you cook red cabbage,

163
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:13.040
which is an indicator blue for alkali red for acid,

164
00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:17.780
then if you boil it in a Allie minium saucepan,

165
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:21.200
it goes blue. And earlier in my career,

166
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.440
I used a red cabbage to get with the white one,

167
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:26.900
to make a union Jack,

168
00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:31.730
a UK flag with a mixture of red and blue,

169
00:11:31.731 --> 00:11:34.460
red cabbage and the white from the white cabbage.

170
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.420
Unfortunately I've lost the photo. Brady is very cross with me,

171
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:43.820
but it was quite fun cooking it in the kitchen. I did it once myself,

172
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:48.110
but it was such a lot of work that the second time I got one of my students to

173
