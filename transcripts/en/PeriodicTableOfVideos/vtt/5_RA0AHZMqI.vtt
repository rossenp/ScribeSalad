00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.950
<v 0>Recently, a very famous British chemist, Ken Wade,</v>

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.180
Kenneth Wade of the university of Durham died.

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.550
And he was also began his career here at the

4
00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:15.720
university of Nottingham.

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.640
He was an undergraduate here and a research student and I found

6
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.480
his undergraduate record card here.

7
00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:28.920
It gives his name and so on, on the front and on the back, it has his photo.

8
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.980
And it's quite an interesting thought.

9
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.030
If you're a student now watching this video, that's in 70 years,

10
00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:38.310
time or 60 years time,

11
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:41.220
when you finish your career,

12
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.350
somebody may be looking at your record cards and finding out what you were

13
00:00:46.351 --> 00:00:48.240
like when you were young.

14
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.640
Ken Wei was an inorganic chemist who spent most of his life

15
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.220
working on the element boron.

16
00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.200
And he is one of the few chemists that I know that has actually

17
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.750
got his name into the literature.

18
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.540
There are a few people who get their names on elements Borum

19
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.550
[inaudible] and so on, but that only happens after people are dead.

20
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.110
Ken Wade has his name associated with a set of rules that

21
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:23.780
explain the shapes of a whole series of boron company. Ken.

22
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.790
<v 1>Wade came up with this, his theory,</v>

23
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.290
which is which he called polyhedral skeletal electron pair theory. Um,

24
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.260
but we tend to call them. I tend to go into my second year as a Colombian weeds,

25
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.183
right?

26
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.270
<v 0>There are so many compounds in chemistry. It's often very confusing.</v>

27
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.750
Why does this one have that shape? Why does that one have a different shape?

28
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.490
Can produce the set of rules that explained why a

29
00:01:46.491 --> 00:01:51.440
particular type of boron compound adopted certain

30
00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:52.250
shapes.

31
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.510
<v 1>They allow us to, um, predict the structures of these things called borings,</v>

32
00:01:56.511 --> 00:02:01.400
these boron hydride compounds. Um, so this is kind of like the, the first one.

33
00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:06.080
So this is, this is diapering. We've got these boron atoms here in black,

34
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.920
and then we've got these bridging hydrates. So we've got two of those. Okay.

35
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.150
And we've got four terminal hydrates. So it's like three it's like,

36
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.260
if I show you,

37
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.120
we've almost got two pH threes kind of coming together.

38
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.900
Okay. And they can make bigger structures like this,

39
00:02:23.901 --> 00:02:25.730
which is Tetra Bori.

40
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.090
<v 0>He came to this university in 1950.</v>

41
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.040
He was an undergraduate here from 1951 to 1954.

42
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.430
So he finished as an undergraduate 60 years ago.

43
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.750
So it tells you the subjects that he studied at school,

44
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.810
it also tells you the name of his tutor,

45
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.890
who was the famous explosives lecturer BD saw.

46
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.530
And on the back is a rather fine photo of him.

47
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.850
He looked quite serious. Students wore ties in those.

48
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.330
And over here, it has his marks. And over here in the final year,

49
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.610
you can see they marked with Greek letters. Alpha was good,

50
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.670
then beaten, not so good. And gamma was terrible.

51
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.700
And here he got beat her for organic chemistry,

52
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.230
alpha minus for inorganic chemistry. And for physical,

53
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.210
he got beat to query.

54
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.410
Plus I've no idea what that means really means.

55
00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:30.760
I think that the staff could put whatever number they like to this.

56
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.740
And over here it says that he did research with

57
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.280
Dr. Brynwood. And then after that,

58
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.590
he went to the university of Durham and he spent most of his career

59
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.160
in the university of Durham, which is in the Northeast of England,

60
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.080
not far from Newcastle, where I worked early on in my career.

61
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.120
And that's how I got to know Ken.

62
00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.340
And he was an absolutely wonderful person in terms of supporting

63
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.880
younger researchers like me. So basically.

64
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.930
<v 1>What they do is they given, um, the, the shapes that they adopt.</v>

65
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.520
So what you do is you add up,

66
00:04:08.521 --> 00:04:13.140
you take your pH unit and any of the hydroids that are leftover and you add them

67
00:04:13.141 --> 00:04:16.260
up in each beach and it gives you two electrons to hold your cluster together.

68
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.310
Okay. And if we have missing vertices, that leads to open structures.

69
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.720
So we have close. So if they're all closed Nedo, which means nest,

70
00:04:24.721 --> 00:04:28.110
I think that's like kind of slightly open than a rack. No.

71
00:04:28.111 --> 00:04:32.160
Which is more open again, which I think comes from like spider, like cobweb. Um,

72
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.780
and, and so on. Um,

73
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.930
the nice thing about Wade's rules is by using this other theory called

74
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.400
[inaudible] theory, um,

75
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.380
we can interchange things like C H so carbon hydrogen units for BHS and

76
00:04:43.381 --> 00:04:46.260
make carbon so mixed boron, carbon things. Um,

77
00:04:46.261 --> 00:04:48.360
we can also use it for putting metals in instead.

78
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.650
So metal fragments can go in there, metallic borings. So wage rules, um,

79
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.520
covers a lot of, a lot of areas of main group chemistry. Certainly.

80
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.670
<v 0>He also have his PhD thesis here.</v>

81
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.800
You can see the title addition compounds of broader on tri chloride

82
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.840
and gallium tri chloride.

83
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.060
If I can summarize his thesis rather simply boron

84
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.130
tri chloride is a molecule with boron here and three fluorines and it's

85
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.800
a flat molecule, a planar molecule.

86
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.050
And it does boron does not have as many electrons as one would

87
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.250
like for a stable compound it's so-called electron deficient.

88
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.530
So it will react with compounds like ammonia that have spare

89
00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:35.430
electrons.

90
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.650
So the ammonia here with a pair of electrons shown by the super

91
00:05:40.651 --> 00:05:45.450
paper can interact with the boron to make a complex.

92
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.830
This is what he studied.

93
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.520
And you end up with a sort of complex like this,

94
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.080
where you have boron here and ammonia here and it squeaks.

95
00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.350
Well, it didn't really, but you get the idea. So if we look in the thesis,

96
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.730
you can see it was lost borrowed from the library and the

97
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:08.240
27th of November, 1973.

98
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.100
And it was then taken out for this video, by my colleagues sometime on the

99
00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:17.480
31st of March, 2014. So as far as we can see,

100
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.530
nobody has read this book for more than 40 years.

101
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.060
<v 2>This is that kind of sad.</v>

102
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.830
<v 0>It's not really sad because all the important results will have been</v>

103
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.210
published in papers. So this is more of the details.

104
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.980
What is interesting about this? There's of course the thesis was typed by hand.

105
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.220
There were no electric typewriters, no computers,

106
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.650
and the diagrams were drawn by hand and actually

107
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.990
paste it in of course you needed several copies of your thesis.

108
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.780
So you had to type it with a so-called

109
00:06:56.781 --> 00:06:58.820
piece of carbon paper like this,

110
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:04.040
which you put between two sheets of paper. And then when you typed,

111
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:05.570
if you type very hard,

112
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.880
you could write something like four on tri chloride and all

113
00:07:10.881 --> 00:07:15.380
being well, it would come out underneath often, not very bright.

114
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.550
This is the top copy of the thesis, which had to go into the library.

115
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.920
And the carbon copies were given out to the supervisor and

116
00:07:24.921 --> 00:07:29.720
probably another copy to his parents because most students give a thesis to

117
00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:33.290
their parents. And that's where we carbon copy our emails. Yes.

118
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.570
The interesting thing about Ken was that he began his

119
00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:41.420
career as an experimental chemist,

120
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.780
but then later on in his career,

121
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.510
he became more of a theoretician.

122
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.800
This type of theoretical chemistry is extremely valuable

123
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:57.350
because it enables chemists doing their experiments to

124
00:07:57.351 --> 00:07:59.060
understand their results.
