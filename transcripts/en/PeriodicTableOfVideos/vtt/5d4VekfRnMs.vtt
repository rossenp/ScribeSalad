00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.160
<v 0>Element 105 WME was the shortest video we made at</v>

2
00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:08.340
45 seconds. I know very little about tipping him.

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.560
I'm not sure anybody knows much about it.

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.910
And I realized there was a lot more to say about it than we did the first time.

5
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.160
And in particular, I have a really nice sample, which is relevant,

6
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.080
which I'll tell you about in a minute.

7
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.460
This is not a sample of top-name, but dope Niamh.

8
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.350
Like all the elements in this part of the periodic table can only be

9
00:00:33.351 --> 00:00:38.120
made synthetically by accelerating a light atom into a

10
00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:41.570
heavier one. And they fuse together. In this case,

11
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.320
the light atom is neon, which has atomic number 10,

12
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.570
and the heavy atom is Amery.

13
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.990
Siham atomic number 95,

14
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.650
10 plus 95 makes 105.

15
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.300
One of the reasons that took Nim is so important in my view

16
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.670
is because there was a huge argument between the first

17
00:01:04.671 --> 00:01:08.150
experiments when it was first synthesized,

18
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.770
which when the early 1970s and the time when it was finally

19
00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:13.580
named,

20
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.350
which was in the late 1990s and really it was

21
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.660
dominium and [inaudible]

22
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.660
, and the arguments about the naming of these elements that really sorted out the really amicable way that we now have of considering the discovery of 

23
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.493
this new super heavy elements.

24
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.450
The original experiments were done in a place called [inaudible]

25
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.450
, which Brady and I have visited where the joint Institute for nuclear research is located. This is a big center for accelerators in Russia, and you need, the accelerators took Sellerator up the light 

26
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.450
irons to smashing to the heavy target and the difficulties

27
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.450
. You only make these elements one atom at a time. So it isn't as if you have a large lump of the material to analyze. The other problem is they're very short, lived anything from seconds to a few hours. So you can't accumulate a lot of atoms. The way you detect them is that you detect 

28
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.450
they

29
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.450
 decay. They give out gamma rays, and they also form daughter compounds, which themselves decay. And you can predict with some 

30
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.450
accuracy

31
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.283
 what energy of gamma rays you would expect. And then quite quickly you get to known radioactive elements so you can work backwards.

32
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.520
The problem is that if you want to synthesize really,

33
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.430
or as stable anatomy as possible,

34
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.530
you need to have as many neutrons as possible in your combined

35
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.250
atom.

36
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.860
The options for making Dupnik element 105 with a large

37
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:02.680
excess of nutrients is not very great.

38
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.660
So they never managed to synthesize any very stable isotopes.

39
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.860
The difficulty came that's a rival group in America,

40
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:15.520
in Berkeley, discovered the element at the same time.

41
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.960
And there was a huge argument to priority. We discovered it first,

42
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.880
there was an interesting meeting

43
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.360
between Seaborg and flurry of the leader of the Russian

44
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:33.040
team. And they tried to resolve this argument, but it was unsuccessful.

45
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.230
And this led to the idea after some considerable argument

46
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.120
of forming a committee that would look at the

47
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.650
evidence from the different teams, an independent committee,

48
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.960
and decide who should take the priority for a particular discovery.

49
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:55.030
And in the case of dopamine, yum,

50
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.500
it was decided the Berkeley and [inaudible] team had discovered that

51
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.450
more or less at the same time.

52
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.400
<v 2>The more I wasn't named after two Tupac.</v>

53
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.360
<v 0>I think there was then a friendly agreement that it should be named after.</v>

54
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.430
[inaudible] not least because Berkeley already had three elements

55
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:16.810
named in its own, uh, California, Emory SIM, and berkelium.

56
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.700
<v 2>Plus the ballgame w.</v>

57
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.720
<v 0>C ball game was named slightly later. But at the same time.</v>

58
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.920
<v 2>We're a bit of horse trading going on. Do you think, or like, you know,</v>

59
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.600
we'll give you an element if you give us an element.

60
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.250
<v 0>I suspect,</v>

61
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.420
but it was also complicated because when they finally made the decision,

62
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.640
they also named the elements that had been discovered in dumpster might Nerium

63
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.260
has him and so on. So they were all named more or less simultaneously.

64
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.390
The thing that I think is really remarkable is that although they have made

65
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.360
relatively few atoms of deuterium,

66
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.850
they managed to do a whole series of experiments that can tell you quite a

67
00:04:56.851 --> 00:04:58.170
lot about the chemistry.

68
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.270
Dopamine comes immediately underneath tantalum in the periodic

69
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.990
table.

70
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.610
So you would expect the chemistry of [inaudible] to be really quite

71
00:05:08.611 --> 00:05:10.050
like tantalum,

72
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.120
but it turns out when they did experiments that it was perhaps slightly

73
00:05:15.121 --> 00:05:16.590
more like niobium,

74
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.090
which is the element immediately above tantalum in that group.

75
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.140
These are experiments that are just done with a few atoms.

76
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.940
They're looking at the formation of different sorts of compounds and

77
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.820
how these compounds, for example,

78
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.480
stick to a piece of glass or don't stick to a piece of glass,

79
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.670
or whether if you precipitate them, say with a niobium compound,

80
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.170
does the radioactivity precipitate, or does it stay in solution?

81
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.270
The reason why these things are interesting is because as the

82
00:05:51.271 --> 00:05:53.430
atoms get bigger and heavier,

83
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.300
the relativistic effects caused by the electrons.

84
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.300
Traveling at very high speeds,

85
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:04.010
lead to the possibility that the periodic table or the periodic

86
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.080
properties may break down.

87
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.060
So it's really quite important that dominium shows the properties of its

88
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:13.370
own group in the periodic table,

89
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.150
which shows at least a tale element 105,

90
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.070
the periodic properties still behave reasonably,

91
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:25.880
as one would expect. This sample here is a piece of granite,

92
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.670
sort of red, Russian granite,

93
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.970
which I picked up on the bank of the river Volga,

94
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.800
which flows through the city of Dopner

95
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.400
past the Institute when Brady and I went here.

96
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.350
So I got my piece of granite and my dope enough mug,

97
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.080
which I used for drinking from,

98
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.120
I think the really important lesson from Doug

99
00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.290
Niamh is that when it was first synthesized,

100
00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.240
there was huge tension between the different groups around the world that were

101
00:07:02.241 --> 00:07:03.650
making these elements.

102
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.420
But now it's realized that as we go further and further

103
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:13.100
along the periodic table, making heavier and heavier elements,

104
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:18.230
the only way that we're going to succeed as scientists is if

105
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.610
everybody works together in a collaborative and friendly way.

106
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:27.980
So I think you should see dominium as the start

107
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.370
of this collaboration, which now has Braden.

108
00:07:31.371 --> 00:07:35.150
I have seen it's really warm between the various groups.

109
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.050
<v 2>Thank you so much for watching this video and down in the video description,</v>

110
00:07:47.051 --> 00:07:49.330
I'll put links from our trip to Dubna,

111
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:54.190
along with other videos about super-heavy elements and also about not so heavy

112
00:07:54.191 --> 00:07:57.550
elements. And if you're looking for something different,

113
00:07:57.551 --> 00:07:59.590
why not check out my channel objectivity,

114

this video about the history of driverless cars and well,

117
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.610
I'll let you find out about this thing for yourself.
