1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.850
<v 0>Cause it's not actually a gas. It's a, quite a thick,</v>

2
00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:07.410
heavy oils developed in the 1950s during some pesticide research actually.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.860
And they found some agents which were particularly toxic.

4
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.010
<v 1>I believe that nerve agents are some of the most</v>

5
00:00:16.011 --> 00:00:20.600
dreadful chemicals that chemists have ever synthesize.

6
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.450
<v 0>The V stands for venomous agent.</v>

7
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.580
So this is venomous agent X and there was a venomous agent G and various

8
00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:32.090
other ones. So it was the 22nd, 23rd one,

9
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.700
wherever X is in the alphabet that they are they've made,

10
00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.350
or perhaps you just signed it sinister.

11
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.940
<v 1>Fortunately there is an organization based in the</v>

12
00:00:40.941 --> 00:00:45.590
Hague, the organization for prohibition of chemical weapons,

13
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.780
which over the last 20 or so years has succeeded

14
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.910
in getting 95% of all the stocks of chemical weapons

15
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.340
in the world to be destroyed.

16
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.010
<v 0>Full here, uh, of the VX agent. It's got a number of atoms,</v>

17
00:01:04.011 --> 00:01:04.641
as you can see,

18
00:01:04.641 --> 00:01:08.840
this is a phosphorus based agent as a lot of these nerve agents are.

19
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.260
So here we have a phosphorous, we've got a double bond to an oxygen.

20
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.600
We've got ethanol group here. The interesting group is this here,

21
00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:19.940
and this is derived from touring.

22
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.130
This is a sulfur and in taurine that has more oxygens on it in this case though,

23
00:01:25.131 --> 00:01:28.220
it doesn't. And this phosphorus,

24
00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:30.560
the sulfur bond here is a very weak bond.

25
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.770
And that is the key part of this molecule,

26
00:01:33.771 --> 00:01:36.680
which reacts when it meets your nervous system.

27
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.690
<v 1>I think that this chemical is obviously terribly</v>

28
00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:46.280
dangerous even to store because if it gets out that potentially it could

29
00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:50.300
cause enormous damage kill thousands,

30
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.510
or perhaps more people depending how it's distributed.

31
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.470
<v 0>So these are all called nerve agents, uh,</v>

32
00:01:56.471 --> 00:01:58.850
and that's because they interrupt your nervous system.

33
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.500
So the normal neurotransmitter, which is used in your nervous system,

34
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.580
uh, is this here, this is, uh, acetone Coleen.

35
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.500
So the nerves work by saying electrical signal from your brain to your muscles.

36
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.020
And when they get to the muscles, there's a junction.

37
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.550
The electrical message gets converted into a different type of message.

38
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.260
And you're a transmitter or many,

39
00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:26.150
many thousands of neurotransmitters that are released may drift across the

40
00:02:26.151 --> 00:02:30.950
synaptic gap to the muscle. And they accumulate in receptors.

41
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.670
And the more accumulation is the more of the stimulus for that particular

42
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.220
muscles. So your lungs, for example, constantly being told to breathe in,

43
00:02:40.221 --> 00:02:43.040
breathe out. Your heart is constantly being told to,

44
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.660
to beat and pump blood around you. And when you want to move your hands,

45
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.610
your brain is telling the muscles here to contract or all released

46
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.240
this neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. This is responsible for much of that.

47
00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.410
There are other neurotransmitters too, but this is the key one for that process.

48
00:03:00.411 --> 00:03:03.400
So this, when it gets released,

49
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.610
it soaks up into all the receptors, but of course, it's yeah.

50
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.890
Point you want to release your hand or your arm wants to beat the other way.

51
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.840
And so these go in and I have these receptors and then there's another molecule

52
00:03:15.841 --> 00:03:20.790
called acetylcholine Estrace, which just comes along and chomps them up.

53
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.850
Um, I call it the Pac-Man molecule cause he can imagine, yeah,

54
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.760
something coming along and

55
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.240
it literally breaks here, uh,

56
00:03:33.241 --> 00:03:35.850
to make a seasick acid vinegar and coding,

57
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.200
and the colon gets recycled back in the cell and

58
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.630
recreate more of the neurotransmitter. This is going on thousands of years,

59
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.730
times a second. It's a very fast process. So how does the X work? Well,

60
00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:54.030
it works by mimicking this molecule here.

61
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.920
I'll say this molecule is the natural food. If you want for Pac-Man,

62
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.690
this molecule comes in and this again is a very weak bombs.

63
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.590
And so it comes off. Then this gets attached to the Pat marrow molecule.

64
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.100
So the normal process would be that the Syrian refugee would come in and attack

65
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.730
the carbon of the acid tile Coleen

66
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.290
to make this carbon oxygen bond.

67
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.350
And then water can come in and pluck that off again. Yeah.

68
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.330
And that happens many times a second. So this is always around to,

69
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.090
to eat more like a pair of scissors, snipping,

70
00:04:33.091 --> 00:04:37.740
all the acetate groups off when we have the phosphorus talks to him bond,

71
00:04:37.741 --> 00:04:41.610
though, it's on there for good. It's not coming off unless you administer.

72
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.320
So what happens is now that you're asked to tell Coleen in your,

73
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.400
your sign-up tick gap in the nervous in that junction,

74
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.590
if you like between the muscle and the nerve,

75
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.440
that's not being eaten up always there.

76
00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.780
So it's always going into the receptors to tell your muscle to contract.

77
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.360
And of course, you know, if it's the heart or if it's yeah, your lungs,

78
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.240
while that's very quickly going to gonna really mess up your normal

79
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.580
breathing, uh, and, and living in D most people, uh,

80
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.100
who have this type of poisoning, um,

81
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.780
they dies is fixation because their lungs have stopped working correctly.

82
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.640
And of course all your peripheral muscles are being told by the same substance

83
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.170
what to do. So you, you will get uncontrolled movement convulsions.

84
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.950
So really not very pleasant at all the other very common one,

85
00:05:37.951 --> 00:05:41.580
which a nerve agent, which people have used, uh,

86
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.150
urge of at least, hopefully not used is sarin.

87
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.570
So VX is actually far more potent than even sarin.

88
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.430
It's extremely potent. So around about 10 milligrams, that's one,

89
00:05:53.431 --> 00:05:56.700
a hundredth of a gram, really not very much,

90
00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.360
really very much is enough to kill an average. Yeah.

91
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.420
<v 1>It has to be admitted that this video is the first</v>

92
00:06:04.421 --> 00:06:09.100
opportunity that I've had of wearing this tie that was

93
00:06:09.101 --> 00:06:12.670
sent to me by a fan anonymously.

94
00:06:12.671 --> 00:06:16.810
I don't know which fan about chemical weapons.

95
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.950
This is not the sort of tie that one can wear at a party.

96
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.410
People are not going to enjoy themselves when they see vomiting, diarrhea,

97
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.020
and the likes written on my tie,

98
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.250
but today it's really quite useful and appropriate.

99
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.170
And I think that fan whoever he or she was for sending it to me.

100
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.380
<v 0>This initially reacts with the phosphorus,</v>

101
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.270
the sulfur to make this bond here. And then this group migrates down here,

102
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.000
and that happens at a fairly rapid process.

103
00:06:49.001 --> 00:06:51.940
So the idea was to have elemental sulfur,

104
00:06:51.941 --> 00:06:56.890
which is just a nice yellow powder and this other substance QL and within the

105
00:06:56.891 --> 00:07:01.180
actual missile were called binary missiles or binary bombs.

106
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.520
The chemical reaction would occur to make the very nasty nerve agent.

107
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.020
And that of course, made the bomb much easier to assemble.
