00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.050
<v 1>Sometimes Brady and Neal do experiments that are just for</v>

2
00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:21.410
fun. And then they asked me what's going on?

3
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.150
So the experiment they decided to do was to drop a piece of

4
00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:28.190
burning iron wool.

5
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.550
This is finally divided iron wire.

6
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.700
That looks a bit like my hair slightly darker,

7
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.710
and you can light such iron will by putting it

8
00:00:39.711 --> 00:00:43.340
across the terminals of a small battery and it glows red.

9
00:00:43.341 --> 00:00:47.510
And you can see it burning in the air, not very vigorously,

10
00:00:47.511 --> 00:00:48.890
but enough to stay red.

11
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.560
<v 0>And.</v>

12
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.880
<v 1>Then they dropped it into Neil's favorite</v>

13
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.850
cauldron in which he often puts liquid ox

14
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.450
When they dropped it in. And they did it several times.

15
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.040
<v 0>That were the most amazing colors.</v>

16
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.050
<v 1>Essentially in all of it. The iron burns,</v>

17
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.880
it didn't all burn because at the end there were bits of iron

18
00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:33.440
left in the bottom. The chemistry is very simple.

19
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.400
The iron is reacting with oxygen.

20
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.223
<v 0>Okay.</v>

21
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.260
<v 1>Three oxides of iron,</v>

22
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.570
F E O F E two Oh three and Effie three

23
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.230
Oh four heaven knows which one was formed in these reactions.

24
00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:56.570
And it was properly a ghastly mixture of them.

25
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.370
But the formation of all of these is highly exothermic.

26
00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:02.870
It gives out a lot of heat.

27
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.030
So you have iron going into the liquid oxygen,

28
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.980
producing a lot of heat. And because it's so hot,

29
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.950
it produces a lot of light. In essence,

30
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.600
what was happening is that you have small pieces of very hot

31
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.270
iron in liquid oxygen.

32
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.450
And they were really beautiful colors.

33
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.610
A reaction like this is not very reproducible because it

34
00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:35.420
depends exactly where you drop it, how the light is reflected,

35
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.780
where Brady was standing when he took the shot.

36
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.800
So every picture is different and nearly all of them,

37
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.810
a really beautiful liquid oxygen is a low temperature

38
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.950
minus 186 degrees centigrade.

39
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.820
And you're dropping in a piece of hot metal

40
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.080
and you would expect that metal to down, but it was getting hotter.

41
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.030
The obvious interpretation,

42
00:03:09.031 --> 00:03:13.620
if you see these pictures is that somehow the iron is

43
00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:17.610
burning in this really cold liquid, but that's a contradiction.

44
00:03:17.611 --> 00:03:22.110
How can something be very hot and very cold at the same time? Now,

45
00:03:22.111 --> 00:03:26.280
what I thought was that the iron was so hot,

46
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.290
that it was effectively in a bubble of oxygen gas, which can,

47
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.030
was bubbling up all the time,

48
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.230
but was able to sustain the combustion.

49
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.640
But you can't really see that from top because you're looking through liquid

50
00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:45.360
oxygen.

51
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.220
So we decided we needed to do another experiment looking at

52
00:03:50.221 --> 00:03:54.930
this vessel sideways. So you could see the liquid.

53
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.220
And at the same time,

54
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.980
you could see the iron at the bottom and see what was happening.

55
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.520
But experimentally, this is not easy.

56
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.770
The first problem is that liquid oxygen is very

57
00:04:07.771 --> 00:04:08.604
cold.

58
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.780
So the air contains water vapor,

59
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.400
which can condense an ice. The whole thing up very quickly.

60
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.450
You could get round this by using a transparent,

61
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.310
do have flask thermos, flask, but they quite expensive.

62
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.140
And the last thing you want to do is support whole metal inside it and crack

63
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.000
your favorite thermos vessel. And because these are evacuated,

64
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.600
if they do crack, they will explode spectacularly,

65
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.420
which might make a good video,

66
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.610
but it's unfortunate if it's an expensive piece of kit.

67
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.520
So after discussion with Neil,

68
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.410
we decided that the best thing to do was to use an ordinary beaker

69
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.320
and to put it in a plastic box,

70
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.390
the one he'd carefully made and try and fill the box with either oxygen or

71
00:05:03.391 --> 00:05:04.224
nitrogen,

72
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.420
which would not condense the experiment was

73
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.610
moderately successful.

74
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.830
What I was hoping to see was the iron going in,

75
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.540
sitting on the bottom and burning, surrounded by babbling gas.

76
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.530
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

77
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.050
<v 1>Of course, what happened is that when it went in,</v>

78
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.540
there was such a bright flash.

79
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.780
It was pretty difficult to film though.

80
00:05:36.781 --> 00:05:39.780
Brady used some quite good tricks to get round this,

81
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.330
and we couldn't get rid of all the ice forming.

82
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.740
<v 0>Okay.</v>

83
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.630
<v 1>But the other thing which we hadn't thought about was that the reaction was</v>

84
00:05:54.631 --> 00:05:59.600
so violent that burning bits of iron would push it out of the

85
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:01.010
beaker pretty quickly.

86
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.040
And they landed on Neil's favorite plastic box

87
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.080
and set fire to it.

88
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.520
It wasn't actually the plastic, but it was the silicone sealant,

89
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.260
which caught fire.

90
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.910
I didn't think that silicone burnt very much at all,

91
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.160
but when you see what happened to Neil's box,

92
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:44.410
we had demonstrated beyond doubt that when you have an atmosphere of oxygen,

93
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.870
silicone burns pretty well.

94
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.200
And I'm sad to say that Neil's box may be ruined.

95
00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.410
It's certainly not in a good state,

96
00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.810
but what was particularly surprising to me was that the iron

97
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.550
had got so hot that it'd actually gone through the

98
00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:08.200
glass of the beaker

99
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.400
and effectively punched a hole through.

100
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.220
When we looked at the cauldron,

101
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.700
we also found lumps of iron in the bottom

102
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.960
Because the molten iron was hot and started forming

103
00:07:31.961 --> 00:07:33.130
larger lumps.

104
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.090
And these larger lumps have a smaller surface area.

105
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:42.070
So they don't burn so fast and eventually they cooled down and the reaction

106
00:07:42.071 --> 00:07:42.904
stops.

107
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.460
And you could tell that they were lumps Irvine,

108
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.260
because you could pick them up with a magnet.

109
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.040
So what's the message. Well, it's obvious our experiment failed.

110
00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.290
We did see something,

111
00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:03.010
but we're still arguing what exactly we saw.

112
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:08.170
And I don't think we can produce a really neat explanation of what happened.

113
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.090
So we've got to get back to the drawing board and design a better experiment.

114
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:17.410
The film we have taken has had such nice footage,

115
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.850
particularly in the cauldron that we really wanted to show it to you.

116
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:26.440
And I think it's really important to stress that when you're doing science,

117
00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:31.570
not every experiment works and you can

118
00:08:31.571 --> 00:08:34.450
still enjoy experiments that fail.

119
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.750
And so enjoy our failure.

120
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:43.930
<v 2>Very nice object. Now, Steve, I have the impression you think,</v>

121
00:08:43.931 --> 00:08:47.050
you know what this is, this has got to be a Davey land. If you're a superhero,

122
00:08:47.051 --> 00:08:49.570
that would be your thing. That would be me. Yeah. I hate to think, well,

123
00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:52.420
my origin story would be, but, um, there's a second picture here.
