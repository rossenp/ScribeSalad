1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.920
<v 0>We're going to tell you about lutetium element number 71.</v>

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.750
It's quite a bit of argument,

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.820
whether it's the lost of the railroad or a member of group three

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.940
in the periodic table, but we'll come to that later.

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.250
We're going to show you some demonstrations,

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.270
particularly a terrific red color that you can get from it.

7
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.380
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.000
<v 0>Element was discovered in 1907 by two chemists,</v>

9
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.980
almost simultaneously,

10
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.020
French chemist shorts or BA who eventually got the

11
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.090
credits and therefore was allowed to name the elements and the German chemist,

12
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.100
Carl, our firm Valspar, who was rather older than a little bang.

13
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.290
They both separated it from a mixture of other railroads,

14
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.670
particularly from a boar containing ytterbium.

15
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.880
At that time, there was enormous arguments,

16
00:00:58.881 --> 00:01:03.470
whether the different elements that had been isolated were really pure

17
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.690
or actually mixtures of more than one element and all bang

18
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.740
published his paper in French then eventually,

19
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.180
and it took a couple of years was allowed to name it and he called it

20
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.260
lutetium,

21
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.790
which is named after the Latin name for Paris,

22
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.070
which I think was called Lutetia. And so a very patriotic name,

23
00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:32.270
which probably also annoyed Val spar,

24
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.700
who named his element,

25
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.500
Cassiopeia them after a Greek queen Cassiopeia.

26
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.530
I can't remember somewhere in Greek mythology.

27
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.170
He gave it the symbol CP,

28
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.180
which was there for the reason why eliminate 112 companies

29
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.550
Axiom was eventually given the symbol CN not to be muddled with

30
00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:59.180
this non-existent element of Valspar.

31
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.470
For some reason, lutetium is extremely expensive.

32
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.790
So we only had very small pieces of the metal

33
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.090
And the tiny bottle of lutetium nitrate.

34
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.420
So we couldn't do huge experiments lutetium salts and

35
00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:24.410
nearly all colorless. And I wanted to try and find the colored one.

36
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.480
So I read that the iodide of lutetium could

37
00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:33.950
be yellow and I persuaded Neil to try mixing

38
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.090
potassium iodide with lutetium nitrate.

39
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.130
<v 1>It was.</v>

40
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.600
<v 0>Boring to colorless solutions, mixing nothing happened.</v>

41
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.333
<v 1>Give it square.</v>

42
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.280
<v 0>We had better luck mixing sodium sulfide with</v>

43
00:02:58.281 --> 00:03:02.770
lutetium lutetium sulfide precipitated.

44
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.080
It was a whitish color, but with the eye of faith,

45
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:11.410
you could argue it wasn't pure weight,

46
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.020
but it wasn't a very convincing color.

47
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.680
There was still a bit of lutetium nitrate left.

48
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.630
So I persuaded Neil to try heating it very

49
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:26.680
often. If you heat nitrates of elements,

50
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.260
they will give off and no to gas,

51
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.330
which are Brown and form the oxide. And after a bit of heating,

52
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.170
indeed, you could see a Brown gas. So

53
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.290
lutetium nitrate behaves like other nitrates. Now,

54
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.690
Neil and I had both read that lutetium was meant to burn.

55
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:51.220
That's a very low temperature.

56
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.780
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

57
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.360
<v 0>So he tried putting a piece of metal</v>

58
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.960
[inaudible] metal into a flame,

59
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.060
and nothing happened came out just about the same.

60
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.500
So he got his powerful

61
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.230
oxygen gas torch,

62
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.270
which has a flame that burns at a much higher temperature used for cutting

63
00:04:21.271 --> 00:04:23.100
through steel and things like that.

64
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.010
And then when he heated up the lutetium,

65
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.640
you had two samples, some small lumps,

66
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.370
and also a small strip of the metal.

67
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.160
And those really did burn.

68
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.260
But the real surprise to us is that it gave off a really nice

69
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.860
red color. And we hadn't been expecting this,

70
00:04:58.861 --> 00:05:03.780
but if you've seen other elements when they burn or you put them in

71
00:05:03.781 --> 00:05:05.940
the flame and some of our other videos,

72
00:05:05.941 --> 00:05:10.590
you will see that elements often give a very nice characteristic

73
00:05:10.591 --> 00:05:13.350
color. And so now Neil and I,

74
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.970
and you realize that lutetium gives a really

75
00:05:17.971 --> 00:05:22.230
nice red color watch Latricia used for in the world. Well,

76
00:05:22.231 --> 00:05:24.180
it's not used for very much.

77
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.400
You can add it to a mixture with your trim and

78
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.000
aluminum to make so-called Garnet,

79
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.410
which can be used for LEDs led lighting,

80
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.300
and which gives off a different color from some of the other light-emitting

81
00:05:42.301 --> 00:05:43.134
diodes,

82
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.030
the radioactive isotope of lutetium lutetium one 77

83
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.420
can be used for treating prostate cancer,

84
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.230
a very unpleasant disease that affects a lot of men.

85
00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.380
And you can attach the lutetium to a

86
00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:01.310
molecule,

87
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.230
which will be absorbed selectively by the tumors.

88
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:11.150
So the radio activity can be targeted on the tumors and can

89
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:13.550
kill the tumors. Unfortunately,

90
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:17.540
it doesn't work for all the suffers from prostate cancer,

91
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.250
but it seems to have at least some promise, the final application,

92
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.630
which is more piece of analytical chemistry,

93
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.430
is that you can look at the ratio of lutetium and

94
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.350
Hafnum isotopes in objects that come from outer space,

95
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.750
meta rates, for example, and from the ratio of these isotopes,

96
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.400
you can calculate how many billions of years old

97
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.890
these meta rates are.

98
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.900
And it is quite an effective way of dating these

99
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.310
objects from space. This is not really a very practical application.

100
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.770
It's really quite an interesting piece of science.

101
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.840
There has been quite a lot of argument recently where lutetium

102
00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:07.970
fits in the periodic table.

103
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.730
If you have an older periodic table lutetium will

104
00:07:13.731 --> 00:07:17.120
be in group three near the bottom,

105
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.160
a more modern periodic table,

106
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:24.020
you will find that lutetium is right at the end of the row of

107
00:07:24.021 --> 00:07:26.120
the rare earth elements.

108
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.800
One of the rows of the bottom of the periodic table in the separate

109
00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:33.950
flock, there's still quite a bit of argument,

110
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.590
whether it's in one position or the other,

111
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:42.140
my personal feeling is that this is not a terribly important

112
00:07:42.141 --> 00:07:46.850
point. What is an important point is that it is element number

113
00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:51.440
71 and comes between 70 and 72

114
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.900
where it actually fits on the periodic table. Doesn't worry me so much.

115
00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:02.000
But the real lesson that I got from this is that lutetium gives a

116
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.860
fantastic red color.

117
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.600
<v 2>This episode was brought to you by Kiwi WICO,</v>

118
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.160
sign up and get these amazing crates delivered right to your doorstep.

119
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:17.920
They've got all sorts of packages aimed at all sorts of age groups today,

120
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:22.060
I'm having a crack at making a bell Lister from the tinker crate,

121
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:23.380
which is aimed at people,

122
00:08:23.381 --> 00:08:27.580
aged from nine all the way through to well people.

123
00:08:27.581 --> 00:08:31.390
As old as me, everything you need is already in the box,

124
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:35.710
the instructions are super clear and seriously, this was just great fun.

125
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.410
I know I look a bit serious,

126
00:08:38.411 --> 00:08:42.760
but that's just because I'm concentrating the future or current engineers or

127
00:08:42.761 --> 00:08:47.380
makers in your house are going to love getting a project like this delivered to

128
00:08:47.381 --> 00:08:49.060
them. Perhaps every month.

129
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.360
I can't even decide if this is educational or just playing,

130
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.640
which is probably what's so good about it. So not have a look through the menu,

131
00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:01.500
choose yourself a crate either for yourself or maybe as a gift and get to work

132
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.900
the addresses on the screen. Kiwi

133
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.770
code.com/periodic videos that periodic videos means you're going to get 50% of

134
00:09:10.771 --> 00:09:11.730
your first Cray.

135
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.870
I don't think it will be your last Kiwi

136
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:18.683
co.com/periodic videos.

137
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.651
<v 3>Is that here?</v>

138
00:09:21.651 --> 00:09:26.420
We say it trim the Terbium Terbium erbium

139
00:09:26.421 --> 00:09:30.200
all found for the first time for minerals from gasoline EIT in this quarry.

140
00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.740
So we've reached the top.
