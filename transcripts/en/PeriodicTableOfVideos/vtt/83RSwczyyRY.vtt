00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.210
<v 0>This video has been brought to you by Wix and we'll show you how they helped us</v>

2
00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:05.790
make a new periodic table. Later in the episode,

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.470
everyone knows that men delayed invented the periodic table,

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.630
but did he really invent it?

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.680
We here to find out we here in some Catherine's college,

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.110
Cambridge where the well-known chemist,

7
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.140
Peter Waters has assembled unique collection of early books about the

8
00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:26.250
periodic table,

9
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.170
including I believe some real treasures from mental lives output.

10
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.400
Let's go in and see what he's got. Well.

11
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.380
<v 1>Uh, most people would expect us to begin with Mandelos first periodic table.</v>

12
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.380
So this features in volume,

13
00:00:42.381 --> 00:00:46.100
one of his textbook and system of chemistry here. And it was literally,

14
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.980
this is just added in at the beginning.

15
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.780
So this is the first published periodic table. Wow. Which is really rather nice.

16
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.600
So how has your rush? And then you can, you can read this. Okay, good.

17
00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.090
<v 0>Just an so it's based on their atomic weight and</v>

18
00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:03.320
the chemical properties.

19
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.050
<v 1>So this is a system of the elements kind of commitments.</v>

20
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.560
So of course the immediately a noticeable first thing is it's the wrong way.

21
00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:11.300
Round from our modern periodic table.

22
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.220
Mendeleev has arranged his groups horizontally in this, which is fine.

23
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.330
So for instance, we see lithium sodium potassium, rubidium cesium.

24
00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:21.320
Now he's got this one wrong.

25
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.830
<v 0>Is there any elements that didn't exist?</v>

26
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.150
<v 1>Um, yes, there is, uh, somewhere to Damien, would we say it doesn't exist,</v>

27
00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:31.130
but of course was resolved. Exactly.

28
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.120
<v 0>Explain to me what's the book and why did he wait until the last minute for the</v>

29
00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:36.020
best part.

30
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.510
<v 1>He was writing a textbook of inorganic chemistry and he'd already written volume</v>

31
00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:44.360
one, and this would actually already been printed. And it was,

32
00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:47.900
as he was beginning to write further parts of this, he thought, well,

33
00:01:47.901 --> 00:01:50.930
where am I going to go next in the, well, we won't say the periodic table.

34
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.320
Cause there wasn't one. But after discussing related elements, you thought,

35
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.540
well, which, which, which set of elements should I do next?

36
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.080
So he wanted to come up with a system and this is his system,

37
00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:04.670
but the books were already printed this, this first volume. And so this,

38
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.790
a few leaves here were just sent in to literally be stuck in,

39
00:02:07.791 --> 00:02:10.970
to be pasted in to the printed books, which is remarkable.

40
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.640
This is rather a nice copy actually, because it was,

41
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.140
I think the first owner was a lady, uh, perhaps one of his students.

42
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.820
<v 0>Somebody has made notes.</v>

43
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.830
<v 1>Yes. I'm not quite sure what these are yet.</v>

44
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.150
I'm going to have to work through that. It is quite a rare book or at least, uh,

45
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.700
we don't know how many copies that are outside of Russia.

46
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.890
We think this is the only copy in the UK.

47
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.360
So I mentioned that the groups in this are arranged horizontally,

48
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.650
but in the second volume, which came out two years later,

49
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.630
he's he's changed this,

50
00:02:41.631 --> 00:02:46.190
he's rearranged his periodic table to be far more

51
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.020
recognizable to our eyes. Uh, now this one is,

52
00:02:50.021 --> 00:02:52.970
is rather tricky and Franchelle it's um,

53
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.650
so this is in the beginning of volume, two of his book. Uh,

54
00:02:57.651 --> 00:03:01.600
so now you see we hydrogen lithium, sodium potassium, rubidium,

55
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.130
cesium going vertically down.

56
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:06.100
So this looks much more like our modern periodic table and what.

57
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.410
<v 0>Is this extra bit here? Okay. He.</v>

58
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.080
<v 1>Developed lots of different arrangements actually. Um,</v>

59
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.980
and so this is also quite good. I mean, it looks like a period of time.

60
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.920
So some of group to appear here and some of the here, um,

61
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.340
so magnesium is over here, uh, as opposed to in the group here,

62
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:24.910
similarly with Sodiomon so on, he had group, um, one,

63
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:29.110
a and one B um, with the, and there's some sense to this is of course,

64
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:29.770
as you know,

65
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.660
I think the fact that this is now a rather more extensive fold-out chart

66
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.440
just shows the importance that he attached to this, uh, to his system.

67
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:40.840
And obviously this is what he's absolutely famous for. Now.

68
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.960
<v 0>He's written here is the natural system of the elements</v>

69
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.690
and he's put his name for it. So, I mean,

70
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.350
he's really gluing his name to the periodic table straight away.

71
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.330
<v 1>He really did this actually. So this is,</v>

72
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.100
I think one of the reasons why mender laugh is often cited as the discover of

73
00:03:59.101 --> 00:04:01.110
the periodic table. He really promoted this.

74
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.550
He says it was his discovery that the system, the law or the periodic law,

75
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.960
but there were other people as we shall see. So this was his first textbook.

76
00:04:09.961 --> 00:04:13.500
And I say it came out in two volumes, usually published in two volumes,

77
00:04:13.501 --> 00:04:15.690
although it came out perhaps in four, um,

78
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.980
and this second volume was two years after the very first table that we saw,

79
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.790
but actually he did publish a more extensive, um,

80
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.680
journal article where he really describes the periodic system of this apparently

81
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.820
was only printed in 80 copies. So now we really are quite lucky to have,

82
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.960
have one of these here.

83
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.410
So this is the very first volume of the Russian chemical society,

84
00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:40.800
the journal of the Russian chemical society. So this then is Mandela,

85
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.390
F's real first announcement of his periodic table and the system.

86
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.230
So this is, uh, the discovery of the periodic law as he called it.

87
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.970
And obviously he realized that there was something quite fundamental behind this

88
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.310
and perhaps the reason why his table and system

89
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.320
caught on more than others is because he was also predicting properties

90
00:05:04.321 --> 00:05:06.210
of the, and it's very detailed predictions.

91
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.690
And that's perhaps some of the other discoveries didn't go into the same level

92
00:05:09.691 --> 00:05:10.770
of detail that he did,

93
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.960
but we see exactly the same table that we saw in the textbook. Yes.

94
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.580
Now I think what's really fun is, uh, so we see this amazing discovery,

95
00:05:20.581 --> 00:05:25.050
this amazing announcement to see the first report of this in English. Okay.

96
00:05:25.051 --> 00:05:27.780
And this was from, uh, from this,

97
00:05:27.781 --> 00:05:31.680
this the same year and it's in, um, the chemical news.

98
00:05:31.681 --> 00:05:34.290
Now this was a publication by William Crookes.

99
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.680
He was the editor of discovered a family of of course. And it was,

100
00:05:37.681 --> 00:05:39.360
it was said that he just reported anything,

101
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.320
absolutely everything that was ever sort of anything chemical appeared in here.

102
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.570
And so in here we have, uh,

103
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.130
this here is the very first announcement in English of mental layers

104
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.360
system. Can you read the, yes. It says, uh, atomic weights,

105
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.610
Mendel F this paper contains a new of grouping, the elements,

106
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.630
according to the numerical value of their atomic weights in the following

107
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:04.610
manner. Now you have to listen carefully here.

108
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.770
So lithium seven beryllium 9.4 boron, 11 carbon,

109
00:06:09.771 --> 00:06:14.330
12 nitrogen, 14 oxygen. He's given the symbols here. So, Oh,

110
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.950
16 than Effie 19 at eight 23.

111
00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:20.540
So they even get the order wrong.

112
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:26.060
There's a misprint where they put the symbol for iron instead of which

113
00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:27.440
I think is wonderful, isn't it? But that's it.

114
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.790
This tiny little paragraph here is, is this the first announcement of the day?

115
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.770
And it was completely overlooked really at the time.

116
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.690
Nobody really took much notice of this. And this was because I think, well,

117
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.670
people really took notice when the first elements were discovered that agree

118
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.770
with his predictions. So he says at the end here,

119
00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:50.300
the author points out that this grouping of the elements expresses the law.

120
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.660
According to which the elements can combine with oxygen.

121
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.620
As you see this publication then in the chemical use was in, uh, December the,

122
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.540
uh, is that the 10th, 1869. So it the same.

123
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.850
<v 0>Yes, but it's took quite a long time from March to December. Yes.</v>

124
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.790
<v 1>But this is because they were picking up these entries in other foreign</v>

125
00:07:09.791 --> 00:07:11.650
journals, as they say here, as they describe it.

126
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.690
But what I think is particularly nice. So it says, um,

127
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.570
the author points out that this grouping of the elements, well,

128
00:07:16.571 --> 00:07:19.030
they don't actually show any grouping in this cause they just give the first

129
00:07:19.031 --> 00:07:20.050
line of his table.

130
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.690
<v 0>But it also shows that more senior chemists are</v>

131
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.130
notorious for not recognizing breakthroughs when they happen.

132
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.320
And absolutely it's, haven't changed.

133
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.800
<v 1>So while we're on Mandela, I thought I'd show you this. This is rather nice.</v>

134
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.930
So this has been described as his master's thesis, this,

135
00:07:39.931 --> 00:07:41.830
this tiny little pamphlet here,

136
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:46.420
there's evidence that he's thinking of atomic weights and organization of things

137
00:07:46.421 --> 00:07:48.760
in here. We see lots of nice formula, different compounds.

138
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:54.280
<v 0>So it says here that it was chosen for the defense of the degree of master of</v>

139
00:07:54.281 --> 00:07:55.114
chemistry.

140
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:55.600
<v 1>Uh huh.</v>

141
00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.130
In some bibliographies you see this is described as his thesis,

142
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:05.260
but it turns out that this is just the synopsis and I'm delighted that we

143
00:08:05.261 --> 00:08:09.520
also have the whole thesis here, which is really nice.

144
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:13.240
And we haven't found another copy of this recorded in any library to take,

145
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.340
there must be copies in Russia, of course, but, uh,

146
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:18.550
we haven't found any others yet. So I think he's looking for specific volumes.

147
00:08:18.551 --> 00:08:22.420
So these are essentially what we would now call molar volumes of compounds.

148
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.480
And again, this is starting thinking about looking for trends and patterns here.

149
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.900
When did I've went through eight different additions of his textbook.

150
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.870
And of course he had to introduce a whole new group with the noble gases.

151
00:08:31.871 --> 00:08:36.130
These don't feature in the first, but I think this one is rather fun.

152
00:08:36.131 --> 00:08:39.880
So I think this is his last, it's not an edition of his textbook,

153
00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:44.500
but it does contain his last periodic table published in a remarkable journal.

154
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:49.600
It's, it's crazy in a serialized form in this journal with all sorts of

155
00:08:49.601 --> 00:08:52.210
strange articles in. So this, as I say,

156
00:08:52.211 --> 00:08:56.670
this really is quite an odd thing to find this final periodic table in here.

157
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.840
And so this was,

158
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.950
I think his last version of the periodic table,

159
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:07.160
but he made a slight error here because he puts the noble gases in as

160
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.500
group zero, which makes perfect sense. It's the, uh,

161
00:09:10.501 --> 00:09:12.330
the vacancy is zero,

162
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.170
but this meant then he put helium just before lithium.

163
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.550
And then this therefore suggested with hydrogen above lithium,

164
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:26.100
that there might be another element of helium and one more

165
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:27.630
above hydrogen.

166
00:09:27.631 --> 00:09:32.490
So he has X and Y there's two unknown elements. Now one of these,

167
00:09:32.491 --> 00:09:35.310
it was thought had been discovered in the sun. This was coronial,

168
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.970
which it turns out to be a highly oxidized iron of iron.

169
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.130
But the other one he thought was, um, undiscovered.

170
00:09:41.131 --> 00:09:44.220
And he proposed the name Newtonian, which I think is rather nice,

171
00:09:44.221 --> 00:09:45.360
which brings us back to Cambridge.

172
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:45.920
<v 0>Well,</v>

173
00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:50.210
you could argue that the neutron should go there and they've got at least one

174
00:09:50.211 --> 00:09:52.730
periodic table that has neutron on it.

175
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.720
So you could pop in the neutron there if you wanted, you could.

176
00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.560
<v 1>This is the fourth edition of his textbook,</v>

177
00:10:00.561 --> 00:10:04.040
where the first periodic table appeared, but this is an amazing copy.

178
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.460
This is actually a presentation copy from Mandalay.

179
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:11.000
This was presented to the Scottish chemist, Alexander Crum Brown,

180
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:14.450
who was one of the people who developed organic structures.

181
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.210
<v 0>Yes. I've heard of him. He did he read Russian or.</v>

182
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:22.760
<v 1>Well, yes, that's a good question. Actually. I don't know. Mental laugh,</v>

183
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.770
visited Crum Brown in Edinburgh

184
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.110
to receive an honorary degree. So this was at that time. So it's,

185
00:10:30.111 --> 00:10:33.350
it's dated there at 1884, which is really rather lovely. Isn't it?

186
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:37.880
How much is that work? I have no idea how much this would be worth now,

187
00:10:37.881 --> 00:10:39.560
but it's, it's really quite fun.

188
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:42.740
So this is the version of the periodic table that appears in here.

189
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.400
Interestingly enough, this one page, uh,

190
00:10:46.401 --> 00:10:50.870
appeared at auction last week, um, in Christie's, uh,

191
00:10:50.871 --> 00:10:53.810
it was also signed by Mandela F like our book is,

192
00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.670
and it's sold for over 20,000 pounds.

193
00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:00.750
<v 0>20,000 Pounds for one page. Yes. So how many pages you've got to? Yeah.</v>

194
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:03.740
<v 1>I think we could extrapolate like that, but I think this,</v>

195
00:11:03.741 --> 00:11:06.500
this complete volume would be quite pricey. Yeah.

196
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.640
Now I want to go back to Mandalay S first published periodic table.

197
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.280
So this was the one from 1869.

198
00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:16.910
And the reason I want to do this is because I want you to see another one from

199
00:11:16.911 --> 00:11:20.060
an English chemist called William Oberlin.

200
00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:25.040
So this is five years earlier. So this is from 1864. So for instance,

201
00:11:25.041 --> 00:11:27.740
we have sodium potassium, rubidium Caesium.

202
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.880
Now he's put lithium wrong symbol up here. And of course,

203
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.080
Mandalay F gets his includes lithium here, but for group two,

204
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:41.030
we have glue Sinia. So the old name for beryllium, uh, and lead here.

205
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:44.270
And then we have magnesium, calcium strontium and barium,

206
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:48.320
and group two. We have beryllium magnesium.

207
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:52.610
So they're separate from the other members, calcium strontium, barium.

208
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.470
And again, what's led in the same group, understandably,

209
00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.260
but when we go to compare some of the other groups in the main group,

210
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:02.380
the they get even closer to the similarities.

211
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.280
So group three or 13 of the periodic tables is a tricky one because of course

212
00:12:06.281 --> 00:12:07.270
they only had a couple of elements.

213
00:12:07.271 --> 00:12:12.160
So Mandalay only knew of boron and Allie minium. So we have boron, Alli, minium,

214
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:16.630
unknown, and uranium, and gold from a mental layers.

215
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.490
And here we have boron, Alli minium, a space again, where gallium will come.

216
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.100
And then again, uranium. So they're really very,

217
00:12:24.101 --> 00:12:27.640
very similar these tables when we go to, um,

218
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:32.290
group 15 or five nitrogen phosphorous, arsenic,

219
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:37.150
and to many bismuth completely right in Oberlin's table and completely right in

220
00:12:37.151 --> 00:12:40.270
Mondelez, nitrogen phosphorous, arsenic, antimony bismuth.

221
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.870
<v 0>So where did he publish this?</v>

222
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:47.370
<v 1>So this is in, um, a journal with it's not to chemical journal.</v>

223
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.800
So this is the journal of science.

224
00:12:49.801 --> 00:12:53.760
So there are many different articles in this from related subjects,

225
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:57.570
but he didn't really push this in the same way that Mendeleev did later.

226
00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.310
And he didn't really, um,

227
00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:03.210
produce such accurate predictions for the properties of the missing elements.

228
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.340
And that was the thing that really caught people's attention.

229
00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:08.850
<v 0>And what did he call this? His article?</v>

230
00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:11.770
<v 1>I th I think it's just an arrangement. So the,</v>

231
00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.820
the title of his article is on the proportional numbers.

232
00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:18.990
<v 0>Of the elements, but so he was quite an eminent scientist.</v>

233
00:13:18.991 --> 00:13:22.950
He was a fellow of the Royal society. Yes.

234
00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:27.720
It shows that you've not only got to discover something or

235
00:13:27.721 --> 00:13:31.380
propose something, but other people have to find out, but it's,

236
00:13:31.381 --> 00:13:35.670
and if you publish it somewhere, when nobody else sees it,

237
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:40.890
then you might as well not publish it at all. So what's his name? William,

238
00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:45.810
when you must say that EarthLink does not have the sound of rain delay of

239
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:47.040
snakes.

240
00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.090
<v 1>It's interesting that the groups also are going horizontally as well,</v>

241
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.790
like mental Ava's first version professor Poliakoff.

242
00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:55.320
Did you know about this poll today?

243
00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.420
<v 0>I, I knew that there were some previous ones,</v>

244
00:14:00.421 --> 00:14:02.910
but I never realized how similar it was.

245
00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.150
Don't you think that perhaps the reason they go horizontally,

246
00:14:06.151 --> 00:14:09.120
because it's easier from the point of view, putting it in the book,

247
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.920
you don't have to change the landscape format of the page.

248
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:15.810
<v 1>But then again, of course, I mean the,</v>

249
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.750
so the arrangement by mass is now going vertically downward.

250
00:14:18.751 --> 00:14:22.350
So if something's going to go down and something's going to go across,

251
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.360
if this was five years before,

252
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:28.560
isn't it conceivable that Mengele have saw this and it inspired his arrangement.

253
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.790
It is possible that bender LEF, uh, may have seen this. It was,

254
00:14:32.791 --> 00:14:35.340
I think this was translated into Russian, not by him,

255
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:40.840
but he says he wasn't aware of it. He was asked about it.

256
00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:42.930
Was it? Yeah. Yeah. But,

257
00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:47.010
and this is not the only British chemist who developed the periodic table.

258
00:14:47.011 --> 00:14:51.890
Perhaps more famous is Newlands and his law of octaves.

259
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:57.200
Now eventually Newlands really wanted to try to establish some claim to the

260
00:14:57.201 --> 00:15:00.350
periodic table. So he published this lovely little book, um,

261
00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:04.130
where all of his collected journal articles were assembled together.

262
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.500
And now I have one of the original ones to show you in a moment, but this is,

263
00:15:07.501 --> 00:15:12.080
this is a nice copy. So this is, uh, to, uh, Greenville Williams. He was,

264
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.500
uh, one of the people that worked with crooks in the discovery of thallium. So,

265
00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:18.110
uh, crux mentions him at the end of his paper, which is rather nice.

266
00:15:18.111 --> 00:15:22.250
So this shows, uh, his attempts at, um, coming up with a periodic table,

267
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:26.390
but these were initially published in the chemical, um, news.

268
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:31.040
And so this is the first version of Newland's

269
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.730
announcement when he's looked beginning to look for relationships between the

270
00:15:34.731 --> 00:15:36.620
atomic masses. So, um,

271
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:41.480
this is in here on relations among the equivalents

272
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.800
in this version, he's looking for, um, relationship between the,

273
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.840
what we would now call atomic weights. Um,

274
00:15:47.841 --> 00:15:49.610
some of them are out by a factor of two,

275
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:52.550
and this is because they just were not known at the time.

276
00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:57.140
So many of these look wrong to us, so they are halved. So magnesium 12, oxygen,

277
00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:01.220
eight, a and so on, but some of them are correct. So lithium seven,

278
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:02.473
fluorine 19.

279
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:04.430
<v 0>And nitrogen 14.</v>

280
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:08.630
<v 1>So his first table, though, we see, um, comes a little bit later,</v>

281
00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.840
here are some of his early tables. So again,

282
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:16.190
this one is going across. So we have hydrogen fluorine, chlorine,

283
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.320
and bromine and iodine.

284
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:22.740
So this is very similar to Mendel laughs version. And this is,

285
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.110
this particular one is from 18, six.

286
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:28.840
<v 0>Did live, was he also asked about Newland's work?</v>

287
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.520
<v 1>Uh, mental life just said that his version was very different and that he really</v>

288
00:16:33.521 --> 00:16:36.610
discovered the, the periodic law. So interestingly,

289
00:16:36.611 --> 00:16:41.380
most of the copies of this that I've seen, um, are signed by the author.

290
00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:45.010
So actually one of those books where it's the very rare copy that isn't signed

291
00:16:45.011 --> 00:16:45.820
by the author,

292
00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:49.720
but this was because he was trying to promote his system to show that he had a

293
00:16:49.721 --> 00:16:51.880
sense of priority for the defense.

294
00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:53.800
<v 0>So what is this table here?</v>

295
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:57.250
You take it out in case I damage it.

296
00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:03.010
<v 1>Um, so the elements in order of atomic weight, horizontal arrangement. So again,</v>

297
00:17:03.011 --> 00:17:06.940
this is, um, this is fairly similar to Mendel lives. Uh, what, uh,

298
00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:09.970
Newlands noticed of course is that when the elements are arranged,

299
00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:13.300
when we come to the, uh, by order of that atomic weights,

300
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:17.560
as they were known at the time, um, when you come to the eighth element, uh,

301
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:21.040
in the order, we have something with similar properties. And so this was his,

302
00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:24.580
his, his discovery, and why he called it the law of octane,

303
00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.910
because of course it's similar with the notes on the piano.

304
00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.720
It's when you go eight up, you get to a similar related note,

305
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:34.750
but of course also missing from this because they were not discovered at the

306
00:17:34.751 --> 00:17:37.870
time with the Nobel gasses. And this means when you include those,

307
00:17:37.871 --> 00:17:41.620
it will be every ninth element so that it would be the lore of nanos.

308
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:44.050
<v 0>This is really very interesting.</v>

309
00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:45.760
<v 1>So these are all quite fun,</v>

310
00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:50.880
but actually what I'm going to show you now is regarded as perhaps the

311
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:55.160
very first periodic table. And do you know who this is by? No, no.

312
00:17:55.170 --> 00:18:00.030
This is a French mineralogist called Alexandra Ameel Baguio Shankar

313
00:18:00.031 --> 00:18:02.970
tour. And that one definitely doesn't roll off the tongue. Now,

314
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.350
before I show you his table, I shall show you, uh,

315
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:12.090
we're fortunate enough to have this. This is a collection of his off prints,

316
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:16.680
and this was given to one of his colleagues and he included

317
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:21.450
a, a photograph. So this is actually a photograph of, uh, Baguio Deshaun,

318
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.130
Courtois, and signed by him, which is rather nice, his arrangement,

319
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:29.550
this nobody knows of him, and it really didn't catch on,

320
00:18:29.551 --> 00:18:32.580
but this was seven years before Mandela F's version.

321
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:37.800
The reason this did not catch on is because, well,

322
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:39.480
for starters, he was a mineralogist.

323
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.180
So it wasn't really being read by the chemists of the day.

324
00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:45.990
But the main reason is he published this in a journal with no diagram.

325
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:51.060
So there is no, there was no table in the original journal version. However,

326
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:55.470
um, he also had some off pins may as he did in the, in those days. Uh,

327
00:18:55.471 --> 00:18:58.890
so these were separate printings of the article. And with this,

328
00:18:58.891 --> 00:19:03.000
he did have a, um, an illustration made and this one,

329
00:19:03.001 --> 00:19:05.880
I need to have some space here. So let's open this out.

330
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:07.290
And this is the reason that it,

331
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:10.620
nobody knew of it because it couldn't be included in the publication because

332
00:19:10.621 --> 00:19:11.910
this is so large.

333
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:17.570
<v 0>So you can see why.</v>

334
00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:21.890
<v 1>The, the publishers were reluctant to include this in the journal article.</v>

335
00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.760
So this is printed on card in, in, uh, it's got red, black,

336
00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:29.600
and green colors in it, and it's about five foot long,

337
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:33.530
but now what we're looking at here, so what do we need for a periodic table?

338
00:19:33.531 --> 00:19:38.420
We need all of the elements to be arranged in order of that

339
00:19:38.421 --> 00:19:40.730
within this case, atomic weights, because of course,

340
00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.980
nobody had any idea of atomic number at this time.

341
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.890
And so these are all the elements arranged according to their atomic weight.

342
00:19:45.891 --> 00:19:49.610
And we need to look for the repeating patterns, and this is the way he's done.

343
00:19:49.611 --> 00:19:53.480
This is, these are arranged. This should be a cylinder. So at the top here,

344
00:19:53.481 --> 00:19:58.460
we have a view from above of a cylinder. Again, we're going round,

345
00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.400
um, 16 units around here.

346
00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.970
And so this would be 16 atomic weight units, atomic mass units.

347
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.550
And then we come to an element with a similar property.

348
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:10.970
So this is going to be arranged on a, on a it'll form, a helix.

349
00:20:10.971 --> 00:20:15.590
So this has been wound round the, the cylinder here. So for instance,

350
00:20:15.591 --> 00:20:17.330
we have here is lithium,

351
00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.160
and then he found that elements with similar properties are aligned in the

352
00:20:22.161 --> 00:20:26.270
vertical columns. So we have lithium here, sodium potassium,

353
00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.790
and then if we go a bit further down rubidium.

354
00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.570
<v 0>That is amazing. I've never, I have not heard of him.</v>

355
00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:36.530
I've never seen anything like this. And it's extraordinary.

356
00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:41.510
<v 1>This is really rather rare because this was only in the off prints,</v>

357
00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:46.310
not in the journal. So this is actually a signed copy again.

358
00:20:46.311 --> 00:20:49.720
So this was presentation copy from, um, uh,

359
00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:55.090
Baguio here and it's the survival of these charts. And he also changed these.

360
00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.840
So this we think is the very, very first version.

361
00:20:58.841 --> 00:21:01.720
So it says at the top of the 7th of April, 1862,

362
00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.020
and there are slightly later versions where he modified this.

363
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:09.100
And so added a later date underneath where he just tweaked things because the

364
00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:10.870
real problem with this is, is what,

365
00:21:10.871 --> 00:21:13.480
what were the atomic weights of the elements?

366
00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:18.400
And this is where the problem came. And so actually we see on the table,

367
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:23.290
Silicon and Silicon is also here. And, uh,

368
00:21:23.291 --> 00:21:28.270
it's on here a third time as well, somewhere. So it's mentioned three times.

369
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:32.560
And this is because he wasn't entirely sure what the mass,

370
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:37.130
the atomic weight of Silicon should be. And this was because they,

371
00:21:37.131 --> 00:21:41.770
they understood that a certain massive one element combined with a certain

372
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:45.220
massive another, but they didn't know what the formula for a product was.

373
00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:48.400
So we now know that when you combine Silicon and oxygen,

374
00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:51.460
you have Silicon dioxide, but they didn't know this.

375
00:21:51.461 --> 00:21:53.230
They knew that a certain masses combined.

376
00:21:53.231 --> 00:21:58.180
And so depending on what the formula for Silicon oxide is Silicon silica,

377
00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:01.780
this would give rise to different masses, but include modeling, which is great.

378
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:06.180
<v 2>Do you think Mandela gets too much credit? Is history written wrong is history,</v>

379
00:22:06.181 --> 00:22:09.030
right? What does this make you feel? I don't know what to walk away thinking.

380
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:09.870
Wow.

381
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:13.500
<v 0>I think you cannot alter history because</v>

382
00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:17.820
sometimes two people or more discover something,

383
00:22:17.821 --> 00:22:22.350
but one of them has a more profound influence than the others.

384
00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:26.700
And so you can't, it's not enough to say I discovered this first,

385
00:22:26.701 --> 00:22:31.650
you've got to look and see what influence you had on people that came

386
00:22:31.651 --> 00:22:33.660
after you. And sadly,

387
00:22:33.661 --> 00:22:38.160
sometimes it's not the first person that has the real influence,

388
00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:42.810
particularly because the second person may get a bit more momentum

389
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:48.120
from knowing that somebody else has had a similar idea. So first of all,

390
00:22:48.121 --> 00:22:49.920
pushing their idea harder,

391
00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:53.010
but they also have a bit more confidence in their idea.

392
00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.260
<v 1>I think it's,</v>

393
00:22:54.261 --> 00:22:58.710
it's no coincidence that actually six different scientists from around the world

394
00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:02.580
all independently came up with their versions of what we would now call the

395
00:23:02.581 --> 00:23:05.490
periodic table, um, all in the 1860s.

396
00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:10.020
And perhaps it's not surprising that one of them is going to be much more famous

397
00:23:10.021 --> 00:23:12.210
than the others. I think deservedly. So, I mean,

398
00:23:12.211 --> 00:23:16.830
mental life did push things slightly further with his very accurate predictions

399
00:23:16.831 --> 00:23:19.680
of missing elements. And that's really what caught people's attention.

400
00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.460
<v 2>Okay. So I want to show you another periodic table.</v>

401
00:23:23.461 --> 00:23:27.330
This is one we've put online. It's at periodic videos.net,

402
00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:31.710
and we've built it using Wix, which is the sponsor of today's episode.

403
00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:35.340
Wix is a powerful, elegant tool that can help people at all levels.

404
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:40.110
Even me make amazing websites, whether it's business or a personal site,

405
00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:45.000
or maybe just something in between, get on Wix, get creating. It's free,

406
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:48.680
highly customizable. As you can see here, as I tweak our site,

407
00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.770
you can start with a template and then just take it in whatever direction you

408
00:23:51.771 --> 00:23:55.640
want. It's drag and drop really intuitive. And there are loads of options.

409
00:23:55.641 --> 00:23:58.100
You can just change everything, get it just how you want it.

410
00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:01.070
If you do want to check them out, go to the URL,

411
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:05.510
wix.com/go/periodic videos.

412
00:24:05.511 --> 00:24:06.344
It's on the screen.

413
00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:09.740
That'll let them know you came from here and that helps us as well. Hey,

414
00:24:09.741 --> 00:24:11.390
once you've got your own site up and running,

415
00:24:11.391 --> 00:24:15.020
why not drop us an email so we can see what you did that address again,

416
00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:18.530
wix.com/go/periodic videos.

417
00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:20.120
There's also a link in the description.

418
00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:26.140
<v 3>Spit. Um, saliva is actually used in conservation all the time.</v>

419
00:24:26.141 --> 00:24:30.490
It's a really gentle cleaning agent. It's 99% water enzymes,

420
00:24:30.491 --> 00:24:34.480
and it's the enzymes that break down the dirt. So, wow.

421
00:24:34.481 --> 00:24:38.590
You weren't joking under the tongue. Is this like a known blood technique?

422
00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:43.120
Let's do a little section here. This is kind of gross.
