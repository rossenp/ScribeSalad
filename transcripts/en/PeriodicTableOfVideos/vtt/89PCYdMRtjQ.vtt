WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.470
<v 0>And of course HAF features in the TV show,</v>

2
00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:05.520
breaking bad,

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.810
which I'm glad to say I've never seen or are you glad to say that it's really

4
00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:14.730
good? Well, perhaps perhaps one day I might watch it. When I'm old.

5
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.520
<v 1>For a long time,</v>

6
00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:26.660
people have wanted to hear what you think of breaking bed before you watched

7
00:00:26.661 --> 00:00:30.280
this episode. What did you know about breaking bed and what were you?

8
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.770
<v 0>Well, I knew it was about, um,</v>

9
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.320
the chemistry teacher and I knew that he was making,

10
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.650
um, some sort of drug, but I didn't know which one.

11
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.100
And I really didn't know much more about that,

12
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.470
except that I think I heard that there were lots of episodes and

13
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.270
that at some stage HF hydrogen fluoride plays the part,

14
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.010
but that was about it.

15
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.850
<v 1>Show about chemistry, not attracted you into it.</v>

16
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.343
<v 0>Well,</v>

17
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.910
I don't actually watch much TV I'm and I watch quite a,

18
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.350
I will until the pandemic. Um,

19
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.880
I went to the cinema quite regularly and obviously breaking by this,

20
00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:19.460
not in the cinema, I suppose

21
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.810
it was not on terrestrial television.

22
00:01:23.811 --> 00:01:28.580
We don't have streaming services on that TV. So I just never watched.

23
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.200
<v 1>And professor as a chemist, when you make people like, you know, out and about,</v>

24
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.680
is it a common joke for you to have to put up with the cliche of, Oh,

25
00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:37.850
do you know how to make drugs?

26
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.800
<v 0>No. I mean, it's, I'm not sure anybody's ever asked me.</v>

27
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.710
Well, I mean, you, you have asked me,

28
00:01:48.711 --> 00:01:52.220
but I can't remember anybody else ever asking me.

29
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.760
I've never asked you to make drugs. No, no, no, but I mean,

30
00:01:55.761 --> 00:02:00.620
you've just tells me the question, but no, I've, I've no idea.

31
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.920
I can't remember anybody asking me that. So.

32
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.280
<v 1>So, so far I've only convinced you to watch the first episode,</v>

33
00:02:07.281 --> 00:02:12.140
the pilot and the pilot starts with this iconic shot of a pair of

34
00:02:12.141 --> 00:02:14.000
trousers floating through the air.

35
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.790
And I get the impression that's one of the shots that made the biggest

36
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:17.624
impression on you.

37
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.640
<v 0>Yeah, I really liked it.</v>

38
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.990
I started wondering whether you could fly chances as a parent,

39
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.123
as a kite,

40
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.650
but I was slightly disappointed because given that

41
00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:33.440
later on, you see where the trousers came from.

42
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.780
I think it's physically impossible that it could have been run over by the van

43
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.010
that the teacher was driving. But, um,

44
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.610
the floated chancellor's was really good.

45
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.200
They look a bit like a pair of trousers you'd wear. No, no, I don't think so.

46
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.280
No. Well, possibly, but I'm not very,

47
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.380
very fussy about clothes. Good clothes.

48
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.060
<v 1>Okay. Go home smelling like a metal lab after the introductory sequence,</v>

49
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:08.320
we have like the title screen for the show, which involves breaking bad,

50
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:13.210
been written with bromine and barium and the periodic table and all these sort

51
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:16.870
of, uh, chemistry formula. I thought that would really excite you.

52
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.110
<v 0>Yeah. I thought that was quite clever.</v>

53
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.270
I thought it was a bit more subtle than these things where they're

54
00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:28.890
drawn like element symbols with the atomic weights and so on in as

55
00:03:28.891 --> 00:03:30.840
well. And I quite like that.

56
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.120
And I started thinking how my name could be spelled with

57
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:37.800
Algon and Martin.

58
00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:42.690
And I couldn't decide whether polonium or lithium would

59
00:03:42.691 --> 00:03:43.950
look better. In public.

60
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.601
<v 1>Episode.</v>

61
00:03:45.601 --> 00:03:50.550
We see Walter the star of the show in a chemistry setting as a teacher

62
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.980
with his students for no, you know,

63
00:03:52.981 --> 00:03:57.510
five minutes or so trying to conduct a chemistry class. Well that's,

64
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.910
that's all of life, right? It's just, it's the constant, it's the cycle. It's.

65
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.590
<v 0>The lesson was quite good that there were one or two things.</v>

66
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.610
One thing I really liked was his flame tests,

67
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.890
which I thought were really good where he sprayed something that gave a red and

68
00:04:16.891 --> 00:04:18.450
a green color.

69
00:04:18.451 --> 00:04:22.200
I think it was probably copper and barium that could have been strong, Tim,

70
00:04:22.201 --> 00:04:26.430
but strontium might have been a bit exotic for the props

71
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.050
departments of the show. There were other things that were quite strange,

72
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.200
particularly in the view of him,

73
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.940
Walter being rather safety conscious later on that he was not wearing safety

74
00:04:38.941 --> 00:04:39.780
glasses.

75
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.060
I also was quite interested in him asking what chemistry was

76
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.400
not. So anybody's been asked me that my son,

77
00:04:50.401 --> 00:04:54.570
when he was at taste school was asked what is in organic chemistry.

78
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.130
And he said, it didn't a rather loud whisper to his friends.

79
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:00.960
That's what my dad does.

80
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.810
<v 1>Chemistry is the study of matter,</v>

81
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.040
but I prefer to see it as the study of change.

82
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.110
<v 0>Walter's answered.</v>

83
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.650
The T was the study of change would have been better if he

84
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.620
mixed it up with the other definition, which was study of matter.

85
00:05:19.621 --> 00:05:22.650
And if you'd say it was the way that matter changes,

86
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.630
I think that might have been quite good.

87
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.510
I was also not totally convinced by him lighting a Bunsen

88
00:05:30.511 --> 00:05:34.410
burner and saying that that was electrons, lighting the burner.

89
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.240
But overall,

90
00:05:36.241 --> 00:05:41.100
I thought the reaction of the class was a

91
00:05:41.101 --> 00:05:45.540
bit disappointing from what was quite exciting

92
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.830
chemistry teacher.

93
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.760
<v 1>I think chemistry being the study of change was a really nice answer. I mean,</v>

94
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.030
obviously it also foreshadows what's going to happen in this television show,

95
00:05:54.031 --> 00:05:58.010
but, um, but I that's a, quite a, quite a poetic, there was.

96
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.480
<v 0>One thing that struck me about him is that he looks quite like a</v>

97
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.960
well-known richest scientist, Robert Winston,

98
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.950
who's quite a famous popularized sort of science or used to be.

99
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.470
I know very few chemists that have mustaches actually later on or

100
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:17.630
quite shortly after that scene.

101
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.090
You'll see that he's got a second job in the carwash.

102
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.610
Um, I don't know how you described it,

103
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:30.050
a manual car wash and that

104
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.180
underlines quite an important point.

105
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:37.160
I think that chemistry teachers or science teachers often don't

106
00:06:37.161 --> 00:06:42.050
have the social status that they really want to have because it's

107
00:06:42.051 --> 00:06:43.340
such an important job.

108
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.000
I'm not sure that that's the point that they were trying to make in this

109
00:06:47.001 --> 00:06:50.840
particular film. But I think it's quite an important thing to see.

110
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.430
<v 1>I think the point they're trying to make is that chemistry teachers don't earn a</v>

111
00:06:54.431 --> 00:06:57.730
lot of money, which is the whole reason that he breaks bad.

112
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.970
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, that might be true, but, um,</v>

113
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.620
I D I've never idea what chemistry teachers are. Actually.

114
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.740
<v 1>We also see a scene shortly after when he,</v>

115
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.490
when he's looting the school lab and he's taking all sorts of things from the,

116
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.420
uh, from the shelves. I thought you must have frowned upon that.

117
00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.890
You're a bit of a goody two-shoes.

118
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.670
<v 0>Was I shocked by his dishonesty? Um,</v>

119
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.610
well that was part of the story, wasn't it?

120
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:29.620
But what surprised me a bit more was the

121
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.820
size of flasks that they had in the, um,

122
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.820
schools store, particularly the, um, they,

123
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:42.550
they all were in a much larger scale than I would have expected in the school

124
00:07:42.551 --> 00:07:43.510
chemistry lamp.

125
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:48.280
<v 1>Shortly after the theft. We see him talking with Jesse about, uh, you know,</v>

126
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.560
preparing to make the crystal meth.

127
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:54.760
And he had monitored him for cooking with a volumetric flask rather than a

128
00:07:54.761 --> 00:07:55.720
cooking flask.

129
00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.050
And like I thought you'd like that getting a little bit of a little bit of

130
00:07:59.051 --> 00:08:00.910
teaching in there about how to use the equipment.

131
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.920
<v 2>No, this is a volumetric flask. You wouldn't cook in one of these. Uh, yeah,</v>

132
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.350
I do. Uh, no you don't.

133
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:12.340
<v 0>Yes. I think I'm in that. That was quite nice. And, um, the,</v>

134
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:17.020
I must say earlier in my career when I didn't know things so

135
00:08:17.021 --> 00:08:20.980
well, I try to cook in a volumetric flask,

136
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.470
but I think that the two, th th the,

137
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:28.360
there there's something that I felt didn't ring very true with his first meeting

138
00:08:28.361 --> 00:08:29.350
with Jesse,

139
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:34.930
when Jesse escapes from the police raid,

140
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.330
Jesse has already left the school and Walter recognizes him.

141
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.920
<v 2>Honestly, I never expected you to amount to much, but I then fettuccine.</v>

142
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:48.790
I didn't picture that.

143
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.180
<v 0>And certainly as a university teacher,</v>

144
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.240
I rarely recognize students when they come back because they've changed,

145
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.103
they've grown up.

146
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:03.600
So I wasn't sure that Walter would have immediately recognized two

147
00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:08.010
students. On the other hand, it's clear that he,

148
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:12.960
although Jesse was a bad student that will still manage to teach him

149
00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:13.794
something.

150
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.090
<v 2>Metric flask is for general mixing and titration.</v>

151
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.660
You wouldn't apply heat to a volumetric class.

152
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.610
That's what a boiling flask is for.

153
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.110
Did you learn nothing from my chemistry class? No. You flunked me.

154
00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:30.020
<v 0>There's this interaction between them, where, um,</v>

155
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.830
they're talking about the cooking, the preparation of crystal meth,

156
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.710
and Jesse says it's an art.

157
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.060
<v 2>Cooking is art. I saw your set up at ridiculous.</v>

158
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.610
You and I will not make garbage.

159
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.840
We will produce a chemically pure and stable product that performs this

160
00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:52.400
advertised. No, adulterants no baby formula, no chili pie, chili peas,

161
00:09:52.401 --> 00:09:53.330
my signature.

162
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.570
<v 0>Well, just not having any of that. He says, this is not art.</v>

163
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.780
This is just pure and simple chemistry. Where would you come down on?

164
00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:01.520
Is there art to chemistry? Well,

165
00:10:01.521 --> 00:10:06.080
I think there is art in doing preparative chemistry. Well,

166
00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.080
I've never been a very good prep chemist,

167
00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:14.630
and that's why in the later stages of my career,

168
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:18.920
I have built the machines to make chemicals because I'm not very good at

169
00:10:18.921 --> 00:10:20.150
manipulating them.

170
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:25.190
So I think there is quite a lot of art and particularly organic chemists.

171
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:30.740
Very much believe that what they do is an art as well as

172
00:10:30.741 --> 00:10:35.150
being a science, a real theme that runs through this scene as well is like,

173
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:36.980
even though he's doing something bad,

174
00:10:36.981 --> 00:10:40.580
Walter is taking a real pride in the chemistry, isn't he, he says,

175
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.280
we're going to produce things that are pure and stable.

176
00:10:43.281 --> 00:10:46.940
There's a real kind of chemists pride in him, despite what he's doing. Yeah,

177
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:48.470
very much. So. Um,

178
00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:53.150
you mentioned cooking the drugs and I,

179
00:10:53.151 --> 00:10:57.320
there was that Jessica calls themselves captain cook,

180
00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:00.260
which for you as an Australian,

181
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:04.880
and for me would have raised the idea of captain cook, the Explorer,

182
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:09.500
which perhaps won't have resonated so much with the American

183
00:11:09.501 --> 00:11:13.940
audience. And also, I remember that captain cook was murdered.

184
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:15.800
So I wonder where the,

185
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:20.660
this is something that is going to happen in the later episode. Oh, look,

186
00:11:20.661 --> 00:11:22.520
you're already thinking. I like it. Also,

187
00:11:22.521 --> 00:11:25.580
we see Walter talking to Jesse about wanting to put safety,

188
00:11:25.581 --> 00:11:29.720
like an eyewash station in place, and he's very sort of safety conscious.

189
00:11:29.721 --> 00:11:32.840
I know you used to be the health and safety officer for your chemistry

190
00:11:32.841 --> 00:11:36.170
department with were glowing with pride at that point. Yeah.

191
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.650
I was very pleased with that though. As I pointed out,

192
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:44.180
Walter wasn't wearing safety glasses when demonstrating to the students

193
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:48.200
and the students setting not far from the bench,

194
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.690
weren't wearing safety glasses either

195
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:56.530
though I was a bit surprised by the safety

196
00:11:56.531 --> 00:12:00.940
equipment that Walter used when he was started making his,

197
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.860
um, crystal meth,

198
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:07.870
where he was wearing a leather apron and his

199
00:12:07.871 --> 00:12:10.090
underpants and nothing else.

200
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.260
And I would have thought he would have been wearing, um,

201
00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:20.680
a lab coat though, sin from the point of view of the drama,

202
00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:24.280
it would not have looked quite as good wearing a lab coat.

203
00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:29.320
Once when I was working in a lab in my previous

204
00:12:29.321 --> 00:12:33.820
university, which was very hot, 37 degrees centigrade,

205
00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:37.570
nearly bought the heat. I wore a lab coat,

206
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.450
but stripped to the waist. So I was just,

207
00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:45.400
I was just wearing trousers and a lab coat because it was so

208
00:12:45.401 --> 00:12:49.450
hot, but I still wore a lab coat. You've never done chemistry.

209
00:12:49.451 --> 00:12:51.280
And just your underwear. No.

210
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:57.210
<v 1>At this point we have this montage. When he, when he makes the crystal meth,</v>

211
00:12:57.211 --> 00:13:00.960
you know, it's quite a stylistic and fast editing and things like that,

212
00:13:00.961 --> 00:13:04.770
but we do see lots of equipment and powders and things being poured.

213
00:13:04.771 --> 00:13:08.370
And it's our first real kind of look at lots and lots of chemistry happening.

214
00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:09.204
What did you think of?

215
00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:12.510
<v 0>Well, I thought it was quite nice as a montage.</v>

216
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.470
It didn't make any chemical sense at all. First of all,

217
00:13:16.471 --> 00:13:21.210
I should say I had to look up what methamphetamine

218
00:13:21.211 --> 00:13:23.550
was because I didn't know it's formula,

219
00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:29.040
but I don't see why they were using red phosphorus.

220
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:32.100
And also what looked as if it might have been cobalt,

221
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.320
chloride or cobalt sulfate.

222
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:39.570
The other thing is I was quite surprised by the volume of fumes

223
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.890
that were coming out to the top of the motor home that they were using as the

224
00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:47.760
lab. So I'm not sure what it was that was coming out,

225
00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:53.040
but I suppose I'm a slightly less worried about

226
00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:58.290
slightly natural causes of the chemistry than the impression of actually doing

227
00:13:58.291 --> 00:13:58.650
it.

228
00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:03.610
<v 1>And of course he uses chemistry to get out of a pickle with the bad guys in</v>

229
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:07.440
this scene where he throws down some red phosphorus and there's an explosion.

230
00:14:07.441 --> 00:14:11.190
And then there are fumes that overwhelm the bad guys,

231
00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.280
give you any idea what's going on. There is that.

232
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:16.170
<v 0>No, I don't think that is,</v>

233
00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:19.590
they said they were making phosphene pH three,

234
00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.800
like ammonia, which is NH three,

235
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:27.000
which burns quite easily. And if they'd had flames,

236
00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:30.600
it would have burnt the false phosphene. And I suspect,

237
00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:33.330
and I haven't calculated this.

238
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:38.220
If you looked at the volume of the inside of the motor

239
00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.850
home and the volume of gas that he might have produced,

240
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:46.200
they wouldn't have been enough to, um, produce, well, first of all,

241
00:14:46.201 --> 00:14:51.120
the reaction he had probably wouldn't have produced the gas, but ignoring that,

242
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:56.090
I don't know that it would have produced enough gas to produce the toxic effect

243
00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.620
that they said was formed.

244
00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:02.990
And the other thing is I'm not absolutely certain that

245
00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:08.420
the reaction would have happened fast enough for the bad guys

246
00:15:08.421 --> 00:15:09.860
not to shoot him. Anyway,

247
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:14.660
they were gas masks at the end when the SKUs has been removed.

248
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:19.760
And I very rarely offense was seen labs with gas masks.

249
00:15:19.761 --> 00:15:24.590
Occasionally you have breathing operators in case something goes

250
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:28.880
wrong, but whether they would have had gas masks that were good enough,

251
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:30.380
I don't know. But again,

252
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.910
I think you will have to allow a little bit too dramatic license.

253
00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:36.670
<v 3>There are going to be some</v>

254
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:42.850
things that you'll come to learn about me in the next few days.

255
00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.020
<v 1>So you finally have watched an episode of breaking bad after all these years.</v>

256
00:15:47.021 --> 00:15:50.650
I cannot tell you how many viewers have asked to know what you think of breaking

257
00:15:50.651 --> 00:15:53.920
bed. You've now seen one episode. What did you think of it?

258
00:15:53.921 --> 00:15:58.120
Just as an overall thing? Not just the chemistry, but just as a, you know,

259
00:15:58.121 --> 00:15:58.954
a piece of story.

260
00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:02.110
<v 0>So my overall verdict is that it's quite good.</v>

261
00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:08.710
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

262
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:13.630
<v 0>Let me just explain for American viewers quite good in English means not bad.</v>

263
00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:15.100
Doesn't mean it's outstanding.

264
00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:21.393
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

265
00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.780
<v 0>I think, I mean,</v>

266
00:16:22.781 --> 00:16:26.800
I was quite pleased to have seen it because I suppose I had some curiosity,

267
00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.690
but it was about not.

268
00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:30.550
<v 1>That much curiosity you've waited this long.</v>

269
00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.840
<v 0>Yeah. Well, I mean, sometimes one has to restrain oneself.</v>

270
00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:36.790
I think I'm in,

271
00:16:36.791 --> 00:16:41.740
it is positive that it's brought chemistry to a wider audience.

272
00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:47.080
I think, well, I don't know how the rest of the story is going to develop.

273
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:51.370
There are things which struck me like the guns,

274
00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:56.230
that every way of which they're clearly much more common in America than in the

275
00:16:56.231 --> 00:16:57.064
UK.

276
00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:01.330
I'm not sure they knew anybody who's ever handled a pistol.

277
00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:06.370
And it's a long time since I've handled any firearms. But, um,

278
00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:11.830
I think overall it was quite fun. Are you inclined to watch anymore? Um,

279
00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.150
how many episodes? All that?

280
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.850
<v 1>There's quite a few. I think,</v>

281
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.260
I think what a good idea might be just to zero in a bit more on the chemistry.

282
00:17:23.261 --> 00:17:27.730
Now, perhaps some of the viewers would like to suggest scenes and sections or

283
00:17:27.731 --> 00:17:31.540
episodes or parts of the series. They would particularly like you to watch.

284
00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.630
And I might be able to put together a bit of a collection for you,

285
00:17:34.631 --> 00:17:36.850
and we could just deal with those rather than the whole series.

286
00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:39.340
<v 0>I think that's a great idea. Um,</v>

287
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:43.660
I think I'm always interested how

288
00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:46.780
chemistry is, um,

289
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:51.480
portrayed in films plays. And so on my brother roots,

290
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:56.400
my brother is a playwright in case you don't know if you write plays

291
00:17:56.401 --> 00:17:58.530
and films, and there's a film director,

292
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:03.120
he wrote a play for the national theater about chemistry.

293
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:08.010
And I had to provide the dialogue about

294
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.930
chemistry for that play.

295
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:14.400
And on the opening night in the national theater in London,

296
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:19.590
when one of the actors said hex or fluoro ISO propanol,

297
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.070
I was the only person in the audience who laughed.

298
00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:26.210
<v 4>Why is that funny?</v>

299
00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.033
<v 0>Well,</v>

300
00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:32.600
I thought it sounded really funny people saying that in the middle of the

301
00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.840
national theater, but on the other hand,

302
00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:41.000
I think that anything that brings chemistry to the public

303
00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:46.430
in a way that is not about learning at school,

304
00:18:46.431 --> 00:18:49.580
when people are bored, it's very positive.

305
00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:54.980
I should say about the scene where they

306
00:18:54.981 --> 00:18:57.320
were making the crystal meth.

307
00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:00.980
The first time they got some enormous crystals,

308
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:02.960
which look really nice.

309
00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:08.630
<v 4>Glass grade, you got crystals in here, two inches, three inches long.</v>

310
00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:13.520
<v 0>But that is rather unrealistic because if you want to get big crystals,</v>

311
00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.280
you have to grow them very slowly.

312
00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:21.410
I don't think that they were there for days when they were doing the

313
00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:25.640
chemistry or at least in the story.

314
00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.360
So that was a bit unrealistic. But on the other hand,

315
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:34.250
to get the idea that the chemistry teacher could make much better

316
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:39.530
compounds than his pupil was probably pretty realistic.

317
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:44.630
The other point which I did notice is that one of the bad guys

318
00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.550
was smoking in the lab.

319
00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:48.260
<v 4>Put the cigarette out,</v>

320
00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:53.083
please.

321
00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:58.550
<v 0>And Walter stops him because it's dangerous with organic solvents and the</v>

322
00:19:58.551 --> 00:19:59.630
lighted cigarette.

323
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:05.000
And this reminded me of a friend of mine who was safety

324
00:20:05.001 --> 00:20:09.740
officer for a tobacco company, the labs of the tobacco company.

325
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.350
And he banned smoking.

326
00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.660
And he was brought in front of the directors who said,

327
00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:22.280
how's this going to look for our company if we're banning smoking in our lab.

328
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:25.880
And he replied, well,

329
00:20:25.881 --> 00:20:30.620
how's it going to look for the company if somebody smokes and blows up the whole

330
00:20:30.621 --> 00:20:35.600
lab. So he was allowed to ban it. There is also a story of,

331
00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:40.460
um, the chemist when I was an undergraduate.

332
00:20:40.461 --> 00:20:44.690
One of the professors who was teaching lab classes

333
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:46.670
was said to her,

334
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:52.450
been smoking and put a bit of the Ash into the

335
00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:56.860
solution that one of my fellow students was trying to get

336
00:20:56.861 --> 00:20:58.030
crystals from.

337
00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:03.310
And the tiny particles of Ash acted as a nucleus

338
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:05.890
to start the crystals growing.

339
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.660
And so this solution that wouldn't crystallize suddenly crystallized

340
00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:13.090
beautifully when the cigarette Ash fell in,

341
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:18.610
I wouldn't for a moment recommend that any of you try smoking in the lab

342
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:22.780
or anywhere else or anywhere else. Yes.

343
00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:33.090
Most chemists are fascinated by what they've always been told that

344
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:38.010
HF hydrofluoric acid eats human flesh.
