00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.820
<v 0>Today, we're going to show you acid rain.</v>

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.110
This used to be a huge environmental problem.

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.260
We're going to demonstrate it to you in the lab.

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.740
And we're going to do it with a piece of kit,

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.280
which I inherited from my late friend, David Jones.

6
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.820
We got the kit, but not the instructions,

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.780
but Neil worked out how to use it.

8
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.910
The problem of acid rain is that in the

9
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.700
1960s, 1970s,

10
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.620
people were burning fuel, particularly cold.

11
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.290
That contained a lot of sulfur.

12
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.910
They were burning it in their homes in power stations.

13
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.120
And even at one time in trains,

14
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.580
in railway locomotives,

15
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.480
and when the sulfur containing coal burns,

16
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.880
it generates [inaudible], which is a gas and sometimes [inaudible]

17
00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.880
, which is a solid, but it's generated as fine particles in the air. And then when it rains, these gas, 

18
00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.713
[inaudible]

19
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.410
dissolve in the water to give either self euros or

20
00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:20.480
sulfuric acid acid.

21
00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:23.840
Rain has caused huge environmental problems,

22
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.240
particularly killing forests because trees like

23
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.740
pine trees and so on, normally do not grow on very acid soil.

24
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.720
And we're talking about really quite acidic rain on the East coast of the

25
00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:39.920
United States.

26
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.780
Some of the acid rain had an acidity or pH between that of lemon

27
00:01:44.781 --> 00:01:46.550
juice and battery acid.

28
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.680
So the experiment consists of a large container in which

29
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.360
you can burn sulfur

30
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.370
To generate the SOA two or three.

31
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.370
It then has a vessel on top in which you can put water in and the

32
00:02:04.371 --> 00:02:07.370
water is sprayed out of some class arms.

33
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.940
So you get rain going into the gas. The problem is,

34
00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:14.750
of course you can't see whether the water has become acidic.

35
00:02:14.751 --> 00:02:16.610
If you just use plain water.

36
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.790
So you have to put in indicator,

37
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.830
He added a tiny bit of potassium hydroxide, which made it nice blue color.

38
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.540
And if it goes acidic.

39
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:34.483
<v 1>Right.</v>

40
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.550
<v 0>Run number one, Neil was unduly modest,</v>

41
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.800
put in just a little bit of sulfur.

42
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.183
<v 1>Wasn't enough,</v>

43
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:00.763
[inaudible].

44
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.320
<v 0>It rained, but no acid. So next time,</v>

45
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.180
Neil, let himself go and put in a large amount of sulfur.

46
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.230
It burnt well. In fact, it caused fog inside the container.

47
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.390
That's rather interesting because when people burnt coal with sulfur in it,

48
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.460
we used to get terrible smokes.

49
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.800
People couldn't see their feet when they were basically because the smoke was so

50
00:03:49.801 --> 00:03:50.634
thick.

51
00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.920
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

52
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.500
<v 0>The experiment then worked really nicely.</v>

53
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.180
You could see the water going down, forming raindrops,

54
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.540
and as the drops fell, they went from blue to red.

55
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.300
Brady was quite courageous. He puts his camera in the water.

56
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.830
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

57
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.600
<v 0>You can see the rain drops coming down and eventually it was drought.</v>

58
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.103
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

59
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.060
<v 0>We really liked the demonstration.</v>

60
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.920
And I think the important thing to know about acid rain is that

61
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.420
it was a huge environmental problem,

62
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.100
but it is one which chemists and engineers have

63
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:07.940
succeeded in more or less solving

64
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.130
domestic fires.

65
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.000
These are heating in houses now uses coal,

66
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.100
which has had the sulfur removed and the large power stations.

67
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.120
They take the flue gas that comes out of the boilers

68
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.060
and diesel fries.

69
00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:30.050
It usually by reacting it with lime,

70
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.860
the Sr two reacts with the lime to make calcium sulfate,

71
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.320
which is innocuous.

72
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.820
It can just be put to landfill nowadays,

73
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.090
most power station, certainly here in the UK,

74
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.620
use natural gas methane rather than cuddle.

75
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.840
So the amount of limestone that is being used for desulfurization

76
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.970
is going down for is substantially.

77
00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.830
<v 2>But if you went out for a stroll in that romantic looking mist,</v>

78
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.720
hanging over the trees around the Lake,

79
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.850
the chances are that you would be breathing in a dilute form of sulfuric acid.

80
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.721
<v 0>Acid.</v>

81
00:07:07.721 --> 00:07:12.520
Rain was not a big issue here in the UK because

82
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.650
most of the [inaudible] was injected quite high in the atmosphere and blown

83
00:07:17.651 --> 00:07:22.420
over to mainland Europe where there's much more forest than in the UK.

84
00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.320
<v 2>Tall chimneys throws sulfur latent, exhaust high into the air.</v>

85
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.370
<v 0>And it had really quite significant effects.</v>

86
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.610
And the forest in Germany and Northern Europe.

87
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.240
<v 1>It comes from verbals Eastern and Western Europe,</v>

88
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.940
but due to the prevailing winds,

89
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.780
maybe around 50% comes from great Britain.

90
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.910
<v 0>I first came to Nottingham on some days you could taste the</v>

91
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.553
[inaudible] in the air.

92
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.350
The removal of the [inaudible] has had one quite strange effect that

93
00:08:17.351 --> 00:08:20.800
Nottingham was famous for growing roses.

94
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:25.810
And it turned out that the [inaudible] in the air was very good at tilling

95
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:26.410
the,

96
00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:31.300
some of the mildew and other pests that can grow on roses.

97
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:36.790
So when the air was cleaned up, the roses started to getting all of these pests.

98
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:41.620
And now the Rose growing industry round Nottingham has more or less

99
00:08:41.621 --> 00:08:42.454
disappeared.

100
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:48.730
<v 1>Would you like to learn more about raindrops? How about the shape of raindrops?</v>

101
