WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.320
<v 0>For the first time, since we start making these Nobel prize videos,</v>

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.450
the medicine Nobel prize has got such a strong chemical content

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.590
that we're going to make to one about chemistry. And this one,

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.780
which is about medicine and the reason why we're doing the medicine one

5
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.220
is because it is recognizing people who have discovered

6
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.570
fundamental molecules that can be used for treating disease.

7
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.050
<v 1>So products, compounds, nature makes, but um, people isolated them.</v>

8
00:00:33.051 --> 00:00:37.120
They find their biological properties and it brought back a lot of them. Yeah.

9
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.920
<v 0>The prize was divided among three people, but half the two of them,</v>

10
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.100
the other half to one person Dr.

11
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.200
You U2 in China.

12
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.420
And I'm going to talk about the Chinese prize winner because as you'll see her

13
00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:57.410
discovery is pretty close to my heart. My colleague Rob,

14
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.670
our organic chemist is going to talk about the other half of the Nobel prize.

15
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.530
Not so much about the people, it's about the chemical, because as you will hear,

16
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.340
it's got a special meaning to him.

17
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.110
<v 1>Back as an undergraduate 1992,</v>

18
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.910
my very first project was working on a compound related to

19
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.700
Ava Mac tin, which is one of the compounds,

20
00:01:19.701 --> 00:01:24.140
which was discovered in which was awarded the discovery of which was awarded in

21
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.600
the Nobel prize this year. Ava mech tin. Yeah. Yeah.

22
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.590
So people may have heard of ivermectin, which is used as a sheep dip.

23
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.920
So literally to you, did she print it?

24
00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:40.910
And it gets rid of any parasites on the sheet and it works for, you know,

25
00:01:40.911 --> 00:01:44.060
wide variety of things, human beings, even. Um,

26
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.750
but the reason I was working on it is cause it, it doesn't work on Collie dogs.

27
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.500
So actually there are certain type breeds of dogs, which, um,

28
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.080
if you give them ivermectin, they have a heart attack, they die.

29
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.560
<v 0>Chemical that you U2 discovered.</v>

30
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.050
And I should say that she is the first Chinese scientist to win the Nobel

31
00:02:03.051 --> 00:02:05.750
prize for work done in China.

32
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.270
And also she is one of the relatively few women that have won

33
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.340
Nobel prizes in science.

34
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.180
The molecule she discovered is called artemisinin,

35
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.830
which is a very potent treatment for malaria.

36
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.770
The reason why it has this rather strange name artemisinin is because it

37
00:02:27.771 --> 00:02:32.630
is made as an extract or one of the ways of obtaining it is an extract

38
00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:35.660
from a plant called Artemisia Ana,

39
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.850
which grows in China and has grown in China for as long as anybody can

40
00:02:40.851 --> 00:02:45.770
remember generations. It has been a traditional treatment for malaria.

41
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.780
Now it's very important to say that the Nobel prize committee

42
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.310
said that they were recognizing the chemical achievement,

43
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.000
not traditional medicine though.

44
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.860
Traditional medicine in this case was what led to the discovery.

45
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.780
<v 1>I was working on this compound here, here's ivermectin. Um,</v>

46
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.930
so you can see it's quite a complicated structure.

47
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.730
It's got this very unusual macrocyclic lactone here and the

48
00:03:14.731 --> 00:03:19.560
Melbourne myosins are the same compounds, but without this sugar side chain,

49
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.200
yeah, that's what we're working on. So we're taking this fermentation product.

50
00:03:25.201 --> 00:03:29.850
So these all come from a streptomyces fermentation and we're breaking it

51
00:03:29.851 --> 00:03:33.030
down and building it back up to make a molecule,

52
00:03:33.031 --> 00:03:36.930
which was retain the antiparasitic properties,

53
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.040
but didn't kill the.

54
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.650
<v 0>The real intellectual achievement of, um, Dr.</v>

55
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.930
Too, was that she realized that the

56
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.180
modern traditional treatment,

57
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.120
which was extracting the plant and then boiling the extract seemed

58
00:03:56.121 --> 00:03:58.620
to produce something that was not very effective.

59
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.900
So she went back to the ancient texts and discovered that in the

60
00:04:03.901 --> 00:04:06.270
old days, people didn't boil it.

61
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.520
And this led her to looking at much lower temperature extracts

62
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.150
to see what she could find. You can see the importance of this.

63
00:04:15.151 --> 00:04:19.560
If you look at the structure of artemisinin, which has an oxygen oxygen,

64
00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:23.880
single bond, and these bonds are notoriously weak.

65
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.040
So if you boil them solution to the molecule, it'll decompose,

66
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.050
so people were extracting artemisinin and then destroying it

67
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.003
by boiling.

68
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.180
It was a really simple but clever idea

69
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.370
that led to the discovery. That seems almost too simple for a Nobel prize.

70
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.610
Well, very often Nobel prizes aren't based on simple ideas.

71
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.490
Graphing was discovered by using sticky tape to remove layers

72
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.390
of graphite.

73
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.730
So I think you have to be real genius to have a really simple

74
00:05:02.731 --> 00:05:03.564
idea.

75
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.340
<v 1>Snuck a great big chess game.</v>

76
00:05:05.341 --> 00:05:10.110
You've got to tweak and change and degrade the molecule,

77
00:05:10.111 --> 00:05:13.580
and then build it back up using the rules of chemistry that, uh,

78
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.660
chemical reactions that are available.

79
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.730
It takes a real strategy and a real technique to understand how to do that and

80
00:05:20.731 --> 00:05:25.410
how to build it out. So we, we scan five or six different routes to make our,

81
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.550
um, particular drug molecule, completely different routes,

82
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.970
but they all start from the same fermentation precursor.

83
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.010
They all ended up with the same drug.

84
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.541
<v 0>In this case.</v>

85
00:05:36.541 --> 00:05:41.490
And the reason why I feel such a personal empathy is because

86
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.560
artemisinin is a molecule.

87
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.430
The time my colleague Mike George had been working on for several years.

88
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.900
So you can see our video on green ways of making

89
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.710
artemisinin, which we've developed here in Nottingham. And in fact,

90
00:05:55.711 --> 00:05:57.980
on the day that the prize was announced,

91
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.630
I was giving a lecture in Lisbon in which I was talking about artemisinin.

92
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.900
And after lunch at the conference,

93
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.420
the chairman stood up and announced the Nobel prize for artemisinin and

94
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:13.460
everybody burst into applause.

95
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.970
And I felt a tiny bit of reflected glory.

96
00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.830
<v 1>I actually was the first scientific document I ever wrote.</v>

97
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.870
So this is 1992. I was a third year undergraduate at the time.

98
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.910
And, uh, obviously when you work in a company, this is, uh,

99
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.420
uh, you know, embargoed it's secret. Um,

100
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:39.400
but because that's over 20 years ago now, um, uh, I can describe this,

101
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.250
this, uh, combined here, although these,

102
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.680
these are known in the literature anyway. Um,

103
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.790
but actually it w it was written on word 5.1. So, uh,

104
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.870
it's taken me about 25 minutes to find something which would open this document.

105
00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:54.640
In fact, I lost the front page.

106
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.710
<v 0>I think there is a very important lesson in Dr. Two's</v>

107
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.330
Nobel prize.

108
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.580
She is a scientist who has worked all her life in China.

109
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.990
She has not gone to prestigious labs in other countries,

110
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.540
and she has published her work, but not in famous journals,

111
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.720
like nature and science and these other journals,

112
00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:25.150
but it demonstrates that really original science

113
00:07:25.151 --> 00:07:29.950
can be recognized without looking at some of the parameters that

114
00:07:29.951 --> 00:07:34.810
younger scientists now worry about what is the status of the terminal and

115
00:07:34.811 --> 00:07:37.810
so on. So if you're a young scientist,

116
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:42.160
it is the quality of your ideas that are important.

117
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:47.140
And if your ideas are really good, they will be recognized.

118
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.560
So don't broadcast this till we get back.

119
00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:02.020
The question that I think you'll all be wanting to know is how much

120
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.210
does it weigh? What is the gold worth?

121
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.450
And so just to answer your question,

122
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.990
I brought the balance and that's also in my pocket.

123
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:16.570
It's quite a nice little balance. So here goes,

124
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.640
weighing a Nobel prize.
