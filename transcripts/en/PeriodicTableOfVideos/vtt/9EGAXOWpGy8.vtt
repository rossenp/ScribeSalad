00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.980
<v 0>People that initially when we used to show it,</v>

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.580
they would just assume it was mercury. So cause it looks the same.

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.690
This sodium potassium found in liquid metal fountain is,

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.280
is a device that's enabled you to safely move these liquids around without

5
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:17.580
letting them get exposed to the atmosphere or to your skin or to anything else.

6
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.000
<v 1>NAC is an alloy of sodium N a and</v>

7
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:24.590
potassium. K.

8
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.600
And what makes it unusual is that when you mix these two metal,

9
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.290
you get a metal that is liquid at room temperature.

10
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.060
It looks like mercury, but it's very light.

11
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.600
In fact, it should float on water.

12
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.960
<v 0>And it looks a little bit like mercury, unlike mercury,</v>

13
00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:48.770
of course it's highly reactive and you've got lots of videos that show reactions

14
00:00:48.771 --> 00:00:52.190
of sodium potassium and the, you just don't want to, uh,

15
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.160
to have these kinds of things around the atmosphere around water.

16
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.070
<v 1>You start dropping it.</v>

17
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.570
It's so reactive will react with the water in the air and it'll be on fire

18
00:01:02.571 --> 00:01:04.280
before it's even reaches the water.

19
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.900
It is a liquid and therefore the surface is clean.

20
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.180
So the oxygen and water in the air can get to the

21
00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:17.510
surface much better than it could as a solid,

22
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.020
more than 35 years ago. There was a lot of research here on.

23
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.940
<v 0>They used to use it as a coolant, so it's a liquid,</v>

24
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.730
so it can be floated around quite easily, but it's a metal.

25
00:01:28.731 --> 00:01:31.220
So it's got really excellent thermal conductivity.

26
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.810
So this liquid metal was a coolant and it was particularly used in the,

27
00:01:35.811 --> 00:01:36.644
in the nuclear.

28
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.570
<v 1>Neck was being used for cooling nuclear reactors,</v>

29
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.700
particularly the sort of react to known as a fast breeder reactor and NEC was

30
00:01:46.701 --> 00:01:51.350
chosen as the coolant, because as a metal, it conducts heat very well.

31
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.700
<v 0>We'll take the heat away from a nuclear reactor.</v>

32
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.610
Kayla here to wait in this liquid metal, deliver it to water without looking to,

33
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.760
to touch course. Uh,

34
00:02:03.761 --> 00:02:07.610
and then the water will be turned into steam and that steam would go away and

35
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.380
would power turbine and create electricity.

36
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.480
<v 1>And sodium and potassium can go in intense</v>

37
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.960
radiation fields without becoming radioactive.

38
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.560
The problem is that it could be corrosive.

39
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.060
And so my colleagues were doing a whole series of studies on

40
00:02:26.061 --> 00:02:26.930
corrosion,

41
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.000
which involved pumping round neck for days,

42
00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:36.890
if not weeks over test pieces of metal to see if any of it

43
00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:40.430
dissolved. That is the metal dissolved into the neck.

44
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.650
Because what that would mean is that if you use those metals and a

45
00:02:45.651 --> 00:02:49.310
nuclear reactor, you could dissolve them away with the coolant.

46
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.580
And that would clearly not be a good situation.

47
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.680
Don't make your pipes out of that one. Yes.

48
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.210
The problem that they had was they needed to pump around this

49
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.330
liquid that was enormously corrosive or potentially corrosive

50
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:08.290
and reactive and to do so when it was quite a high temperature,

51
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:13.030
because they were simulating reactors that had the temperature of

52
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.730
two or 300 degrees centigrade, if not more.

53
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.670
And they devised a fantastic pump and built one

54
00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:26.290
of these pumps out of glass so that it could be shown as a demonstration

55
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.580
for visitors.

56
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.330
Unfortunately about 10 years ago,

57
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:37.510
also before we started periodic videos,

58
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.490
it was decided that these demonstrations were so dangerous

59
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.050
that we had to get rid of them, but before it was destroyed,

60
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.200
my colleagues, Steve made the video about,

61
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.020
so let me explain how it works.

62
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.730
It is based on the same principle that is used for electric

63
00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.600
motors.

64
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.550
You have a piece of metal carrying a current,

65
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.650
which is in a magnetic field and there is motion what we have

66
00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:11.140
here. And this is a crude analogy.

67
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.240
We have a powerful magnet North and South magnetic poles. Okay.

68
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.430
And in between we have the container with the neck and then there are

69
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.050
two electrodes going in two wires that carried current.

70
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.430
There is a historic trick in physics for

71
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.360
memorizing called Fleming's left-hand rule.

72
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.160
So it's based on the thumb and these two fingers, which if you hold them,

73
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.260
write a rule at right angles.

74
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.080
And what this says is that if you have the magnetic field given by this

75
00:04:47.081 --> 00:04:51.640
finger going in this direction from North to South and the

76
00:04:51.641 --> 00:04:54.190
current going through in that direction,

77
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.880
you get motion going upwards in the direction, my thumb.

78
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.980
So what you see there is you see Steve cranking up the current as

79
00:05:02.981 --> 00:05:03.701
he cranks up,

80
00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:08.050
the current what's happens is that the liquid carrying the

81
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.250
current between the two wires experiences an upthrust.

82
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.030
And because it's very light, it's not too dense material.

83
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.000
It shoots upwards and you get to little fountain.

84
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.130
The pipe work is such that the liquid then just goes round and round

85
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.810
and round.

86
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.000
<v 0>You can, you can see this on the video that you have.</v>

87
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.530
The second thing is the current it's going to cost the electrodes. Uh,

88
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.840
the first thing is a field. That's the big magnet.

89
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.170
And when you put those two together and you turn up the, uh,

90
00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:40.740
the current and you'll see me doing that in the video, then you get the motion.

91
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.700
And the motion is the fountain that gets flung up through that. Um, through the,

92
00:05:44.701 --> 00:05:45.570
as a guest, as an orifice,

93
00:05:45.571 --> 00:05:50.070
that 30 top the fountain goes up and then the stuff comes down and goes back

94
00:05:50.071 --> 00:05:51.630
down the bottom and then gets thrown up again.

95
00:05:51.631 --> 00:05:55.320
So you get this continuing cycle of liquid metal that's going around and around.

96
00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.500
<v 1>Because the stuff is so the whole operators is then surrounded by</v>

97
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:03.890
glass bulb, which contains are gone.

98
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.360
So if there is a leak or being well, it doesn't burst into flames.

99
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.100
So the knack was going round and round and round washing the surface over and

100
00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:13.970
over again.

101
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.260
And so you could measure the corrosion quite precisely.

102
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.920
And sometimes they measured the corrosion electrically.

103
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.180
They measuring the resistance of the piece of metal that they were studying

104
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.940
because knack is such a good conductor.

105
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.140
They could make the whole operators out of metal and it would still work.

106
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.420
The one we've got on the video is glass.

107
00:06:35.421 --> 00:06:40.010
So you can see what's happening for the first 20 years that was here at

108
00:06:40.011 --> 00:06:43.880
Nottingham. We used to demonstrate this to visiting students.

109
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:47.810
It would just be sitting in the corner of lab. And as we took a party round,

110
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.860
we'd say, look, I switched this and that. And they'd get all go, Ooh,

111
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.930
and perhaps come to Nottingham.

112
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.570
But most of them didn't realize quite what a historic piece of equipment it is.

113
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:05.360
My feeling is that probably it was an act of vandalism to destroy

114
00:07:05.361 --> 00:07:06.194
this equipment.

115
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:11.060
And we should have just made it rather safer and still kept it because it is

116
00:07:11.061 --> 00:07:13.580
really is Storic experiment.

117
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.850
<v 0>As far as I know, I mean, I used to use this to demonstrate when it,</v>

118
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.310
when it was, uh, not deemed to be, uh, too dangerous to do so, but then it was,

119
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:22.263
and it was taken away.

120
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.460
<v 1>Of course we could fill it with mercury.</v>

121
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.220
The problem is that mercury is very dense.

122
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.290
The mercury would feel exactly the same force from the

123
00:07:32.291 --> 00:07:33.820
current and the magnetic field,

124
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:38.620
but it just wouldn't be enough to lift the mercury up because it's so dense.

125
00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:43.600
What of course you could do is to put in a very, very much bigger current,

126
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.390
and then you could make mercury go round,

127
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.420
but probably something unpleasant would happen.

128
00:07:49.421 --> 00:07:51.400
It would overheat or arc or whatever.

129
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.360
So it's really designed just for doing neck,

130
00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:00.100
or you could use it at higher temperature for liquid sodium or liquid potassium.

131
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.010
Like everybody dealing with dangerous chemicals.

132
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:10.510
If you know how to handle them, they can be quite safe. In fact,

133
00:08:10.511 --> 00:08:11.920
on the other side of this building,

134
00:08:11.921 --> 00:08:16.270
there was a piece of operators that had two gallons

135
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:21.220
that is about eight or nine liters of liquid

136
00:08:21.221 --> 00:08:25.060
sodium at a temperature above its melting point,

137
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.160
which is 96 degrees.

138
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:30.490
And you could go up there rather like to tear, turn,

139
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:35.890
and just take a thermos full of liquid sodium and take it

140
00:08:35.891 --> 00:08:36.730
back to your lab.

141
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.340
And that was there for perhaps 10 years before they got rid of

142
00:08:42.341 --> 00:08:43.174
it.

143
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:47.410
And so I never heard of any accidents at all from these.
