1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.510
<v 0>Chromium is a really surprisingly exciting element.</v>

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.060
We've had real fun in the lab and we've had full Kainos

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.750
fires, Neil nearly caught fire.

4
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.360
You're going to see some quite exciting things.

5
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.340
And also I hope learned something about the chemistry of this really interesting

6
00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:23.370
element is played a big role in my life,

7
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.270
particularly in my research ever since I've been to school. Boy,

8
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.600
chromium is element number 24 in the middle of the so-called transition

9
00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:35.160
metals in the first row.

10
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.320
It was first discovered or rather its first compounds were discovered

11
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.480
in the middle of the 18th century in mines in the Euro

12
00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:47.910
mountains in Eastern Russia.

13
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.740
One of the minerals that was discovered was a very bright yellow

14
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.930
pigment lead chromate.

15
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.910
You can make it in the lab by dropping ammonium dichromate and we'll show

16
00:00:59.911 --> 00:01:01.830
you another interesting reaction of that.

17
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.370
Later dropping a solution of ammonium dichromate,

18
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.900
which is orange into a beaker containing led

19
00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:13.650
acetate, which is colorless well, slightly cloudy,

20
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.780
and you get these fantastically bright yellow precipitate

21
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:23.580
formed. It used to be called Chrome yellow and be used as a paint.

22
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.080
Now people don't really want to use lead salts in paints,

23
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.620
but you can still see this terrific color.

24
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.600
It's important to say that even for chemists like me to see this

25
00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:40.170
reaction gets again is really exciting.

26
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.700
And particularly because the formation in the beaker is

27
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.140
governed by the swirling of the liquid and the mixing and you see really

28
00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:51.780
beautiful patterns and it always gives me a thrill.

29
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.690
Then in the later 18th century,

30
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.640
a French chemist Louis evoke Lang discovered that you could convert

31
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.680
Chrome yellow into an oxide of chromium chromium trioxide

32
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.990
by treating it with acid later,

33
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.970
he reacted this oxide with hydrogen to make chromium metal

34
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.440
and discover the element.

35
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.730
I think it's just worth mentioning that the reason that so many elements were

36
00:02:17.731 --> 00:02:21.990
discovered at the end of the 18th century, beginning of the 19th century,

37
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.330
is that's when the idea or the modern idea of chemical elements was

38
00:02:27.331 --> 00:02:28.590
first formulated.

39
00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:32.670
So before then people were not looking for chemical elements.

40
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.040
And once the idea was formulated,

41
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.350
a whole massive elements were found relatively quickly while we're talking about

42
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.830
Tremblant trioxide, it's one of my favorite compounds.

43
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.180
You may have seen an earlier video where I set off all the fire alarms in the

44
00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:49.530
chemistry department,

45
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.220
by mistake with criminal trioxide and ethanol.

46
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.023
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

47
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.580
<v 2>You forgot to switch it off.</v>

48
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.680
<v 0>Of got better. And I persuaded Neil to try this reaction himself.</v>

49
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.690
You poor ethanol,

50
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.160
which is a compound of carbon hydrogen oxygen onto chromium

51
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.180
trioxide,

52
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.580
which is a compound that chromium where the chromium has given all its electrons

53
00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:31.050
to the oxygen. It is a very powerful oxidizing agent.

54
00:03:31.051 --> 00:03:34.980
It makes things burn and it really made the ethanol

55
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.700
Poor Niels beaker caught fire.

56
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.110
He sort of known perhaps that it would, if he'd watched my video,

57
00:03:46.111 --> 00:03:47.100
he would have got the water

58
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.690
Reaction. Not only produces flames,

59
00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.790
but it converts the chromium.

60
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.360
Trioxide into different oxide of chromium,

61
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.310
where there are some electrons on the chromium and it is bright green.

62
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.470
It is so-called chromium two oxygen, three,

63
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.070
some people call it chromium sesqui oxide.

64
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.680
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

65
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.280
<v 0>And the flames all went on a GoPro camera,</v>

66
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.360
but I'm pleased to say the GoPro camera was not injured.

67
00:04:30.361 --> 00:04:32.460
So it'll survive for our next video.

68
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.560
This brings us back to the name chromium, which is derived from the Greek word,

69
00:04:40.561 --> 00:04:41.580
meaning a color.

70
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.770
And you've heard of monochromatic and words like that.

71
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.260
And chromium forms the most amazing range of different colored

72
00:04:52.261 --> 00:04:53.094
compounds.

73
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.140
You've already seen it going from red to green and you can get almost

74
00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.580
any color you want.

75
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.410
And the reason that it has all these different colors is because as a

76
00:05:04.411 --> 00:05:05.610
transition metal,

77
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.540
it has four D electrons and two S electrons.

78
00:05:09.541 --> 00:05:13.830
So that's six electrons and in different compounds,

79
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.820
it gives different number of electrons to the neighboring atom.

80
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.100
And the colors are associated with the energy

81
00:05:23.101 --> 00:05:27.140
levels of the electrons that are left on the chromium atoms.

82
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.710
So you have different numbers of electrons and the energy levels can

83
00:05:31.711 --> 00:05:34.980
also differ depending on the atoms round it.

84
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.130
If the energy levels are far apart,

85
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.510
they will absorb blue light. And so the compound will look red.

86
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.510
If the energy levels are close together,

87
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.420
they will absorb red light and look blue.

88
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.220
You can see a really nice color change when you drop sodium chromate

89
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.580
into acidified hydrogen peroxide,

90
00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:00.830
the chromate liberates the oxygen from the hydrogen

91
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:01.790
peroxide.

92
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.010
And part of the chromate is reduced.

93
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.160
That is, it receives the electrons.

94
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.210
And so the chromium goes to a greenish color. Now,

95
00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:16.460
when you actually look at the experiments,

96
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.500
what Neil did was the T took a dropper full of the chromate

97
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:26.330
solution and stuck it at the bottom of the beaker and then squeezed it.

98
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.760
So the chromate solution went to the bottom.

99
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.380
It reacted immediately going a sort of greenish Brown color,

100
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.870
which if you'd looked very carefully,

101
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.100
you will see is actually a mixture of a blue compound and a green one.

102
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.810
But the oxygen that is liberated the bubbles go up to the

103
00:06:44.811 --> 00:06:46.670
surface and as it goes up,

104
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.850
it takes up streams of this colored liquid.

105
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.500
So you have quite a strange, almost like a garden growing.

106
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.870
And again, for me as a chemist,

107
00:06:56.871 --> 00:07:01.370
it's really exciting to see how these things behave.

108
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.610
You can't predict exactly what's going to happen.

109
00:07:04.611 --> 00:07:07.760
So every experiment is exciting in the past.

110
00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:10.610
We've done this reaction before where we did it the other way,

111
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.770
round pouring hydrogen peroxide into chromate solution.

112
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:21.350
And there you do get quite dramatic color changes. And as I mentioned,

113
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.330
a professor that I knew blew off two of his fingers with this reaction.

114
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.700
So you've got to be careful.

115
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:34.010
Neil did one other really spectacular reaction with the ammonium

116
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.580
dichromate now ammonium, which is NH four.

117
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:42.230
Plus if you think about it contains hydrogen, which can burn.

118
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.430
And on the other hand, it has chromate which can give up oxygen.

119
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:51.350
So if you like, it's got both the oxidant and the fuel all in one compound,

120
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.210
the bottle says careful,

121
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:58.010
explosive and Neal heated this up in a nice round

122
00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:00.860
bottom flask, quite a sizeable flowers.

123
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.830
And when the reaction takes off,

124
00:08:03.831 --> 00:08:06.350
it takes quite a bit of heating to get it going.

125
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:11.360
Then it looks just like a volcano because you have

126
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:15.260
the green chromium oxide being formed,

127
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.890
which looks a bit like lava and the flames shooting up.

128
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:26.720
All three of us Brady, me and Neil were really quite impressed by that reaction.

129
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:27.860
Unfortunately,

130
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:32.480
the filter that Neil used at the top wasn't strong enough

131
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:37.640
thermally to resist the heat. It caught fire, and then it melted.

132
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.330
But apart from that, the reaction was quite a success.

133
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:46.010
Chromium plating was used very widely in the United States,

134
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.420
in the car industry,

135
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:52.250
the automobile industry and with expensive cars were covered

136
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.650
in chromed components.

137
00:08:54.651 --> 00:08:58.680
So they looked really shiny and silver nowadays,

138
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:03.420
people are trying to save weight on cars and you don't use metal for the

139
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.220
bumpers and things like that.

140
00:09:05.221 --> 00:09:08.640
So there's almost no Chrome plating on cars.

141
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:13.260
Let me tell you about chromium in my research.

142
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:18.720
I've worked for many years with this compound chromium hexapod combination

143
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.230
chromium with six CEO groups round it.

144
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:26.160
If you isolated in a solid, it's a very low temperature,

145
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.890
minus 250 degrees,

146
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:33.630
you can irradiate UV light on it and generate chromium

147
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:37.200
Pentecost. Now chromium with five CEO groups around it,

148
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:42.660
which is enormously reactive and would react immediately and disappear.

149
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:43.770
If it was not frozen,

150
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.790
that's such low temperature and that sort of low temperature,

151
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.900
it will re even react with argon. We all think as are,

152
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.110
is really in gas. My fellow student,

153
00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:00.240
Robin Perutz discovered it would react with argon and form a really nice

154
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.140
purple color.

155
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:06.300
I reproduced his experiment for my first lecture that I gave outside my own

156
00:10:06.301 --> 00:10:08.730
university. I still showed the slide.

157
00:10:08.731 --> 00:10:11.970
43 years on the lecture was a bit of a disappointment.

158
00:10:11.971 --> 00:10:15.840
There was a Nobel prize winner. So George Porter, who was meant to be there,

159
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.320
but it turned out he had another engagement.

160
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:21.630
So I never saw him at the lecture.

161
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:26.730
It then turned out that CLC five will react with Xenon

162
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.030
I and my colleague, Tim Turner. My professor, um,

163
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:34.380
published the first paper in which CRC five seen none was discovered in

164
00:10:34.381 --> 00:10:35.250
solution.

165
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:40.380
And now this is still a major research area, not Tignum.

166
00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:41.160
And my colleague,

167
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.540
Mike George is using very fast spectroscopy to look at metal,

168
00:10:45.541 --> 00:10:46.950
Xenon compounds.

169
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:51.300
Most school teachers don't know that see non will react with transition metals,

170
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:55.830
but it's now quite a widespread phenomenon. When I was a school boy,

171
00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:01.230
aged 16, I passed my exams a year earlier than my classmate.

172
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.890
So I was allowed to do a research project all by myself.

173
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.210
Wouldn't be allowed nowadays for reasons I can't remember. Now,

174
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.950
I decided to look at the reaction of copper chromate and ammonia for

175
00:11:13.951 --> 00:11:17.250
nostalgia state. I asked Neil to repeat this experiment,

176
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:21.330
taking copper sulfate, which is a blue solution,

177
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:22.800
adding to it,

178
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:27.810
a solution of sodium chromate and you get a rather

179
00:11:27.811 --> 00:11:32.370
sort of muddy precipitate. Doesn't look at all appetizing.

180
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:35.190
And then if you add ammonia,

181
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.610
it goes dark blue.

182
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:43.290
If you haven't mixed it up properly like Neil hadn't and then it goes green.

183
00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:44.820
Now,

184
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:49.200
what I want you to see from this experiment is it's a pretty messy

185
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.160
experiment and it was completely mad for me,

186
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.370
a school boy,

187
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.690
to try and study this reaction by re did it with great

188
00:11:58.691 --> 00:12:03.520
determination. I never really discovered anything important,

189
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:08.920
but it did really hooked me on doing chemical research and I've been doing it

190
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:13.180
nearly ever since I was so devoted to this reaction.

191
00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:17.770
I had a rack of test tubes with these different samples above my,

192
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:20.350
on the shelf of, by my bed in my bedroom.

193
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.350
I'm not sure what my parents thought of this.

194
00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:25.171
<v 3>Hi there everyone is,</v>

195
00:12:25.171 --> 00:12:29.850
this is the first video we've posted since passing 1 million subscribers.

196
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.700
I thought I'd take this opportunity to thank everyone.

197
00:12:32.701 --> 00:12:34.380
Who's watching periodic videos,

198
00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.340
a special thanks to everyone who subscribes a special, special,

199
00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:39.151
thanks to everyone.

200
00:12:39.151 --> 00:12:43.410
Who's used the little notification bell with their subscription, a special,

201
00:12:43.411 --> 00:12:46.950
special, special, thanks to everyone who supports us on Patrion.

202
00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.740
There's an address on the screen. Also,

203
00:12:49.741 --> 00:12:51.810
if you're someone who's gotten into watching podcasts,

204
00:12:51.811 --> 00:12:54.120
I thought I might tell you, I actually have two podcasts.

205
00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:58.470
I do one with a fellow YouTuber called CGP grey. You may have heard of him.

206
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:02.040
And our podcast is called hello internet. And there's a second podcast.

207
00:13:02.041 --> 00:13:06.780
I do a newer one called the unmade podcast that I do with an old friend of mine

208
00:13:06.781 --> 00:13:09.780
called Tim. The names of them are on the screen.

209
00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:13.800
You can find links in the video description or just search hallow internet,

210
00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:18.600
or the unmade podcast on your podcast. Player of choice. Thanks for watching.

211
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:19.980
We'll see you again here soon.
