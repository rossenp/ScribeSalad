1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.920
<v 0>I'm in the library of the Royal society in London and the society</v>

2
00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:08.100
has one of the best autograph books in the world.

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.650
And this is Keith Moore.

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.600
Who's our librarian who is going to introduce me

5
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.110
to the book and show me the most interesting signature.

6
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.630
<v 2>No, here's the Royal societies charter book. And if we open it,</v>

7
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.430
you'll see immediately what's going on here.

8
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.110
It opens with the Royal code vibes because of course where the Royal society,

9
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.940
and then you will find the Royal societies own coat of arms with the

10
00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:41.090
motto nullius in Verba, take nobody's word for it.

11
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.050
And then the reason it's called the charter book is because the role societies

12
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.400
charters are reproduced in the text on development here.

13
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.690
This is not on paper. This is animal skin. There are other stiffer than paper,

14
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.410
the slightly slick to the touch. Uh, I'm wearing gloves.

15
00:00:57.411 --> 00:01:00.710
So it's harder to feel that, but, um, you can actually,

16
00:01:00.711 --> 00:01:03.770
if you're on your fingers over it, you can feel the nap of the animal,

17
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.810
but you'll see, this is really where the book gets very interesting. Indeed.

18
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.260
The first page of the signatures and, uh,

19
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.440
the head of the list here is Charles. The second,

20
00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:17.450
who was the site first patron,

21
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.770
the man who put the Royal into the Royal society or the Royals here,

22
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.200
the one you've probably heard of is Prince Rupert,

23
00:01:24.201 --> 00:01:28.220
who was interested in science from the Prince Rupert stroke. It is indeed.

24
00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:30.380
So he did do experiments, uh,

25
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.520
after all society and elsewhere has the class drops that he produced, uh,

26
00:01:34.521 --> 00:01:37.590
are quite famous. Each successive Monarch, uh,

27
00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:42.170
and therefore each successive patron of the Royal society gets their own highly

28
00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:45.470
decorated Royal page. And if I turn the page here,

29
00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:50.270
this is the first page where you get the fellowship proper.

30
00:01:50.271 --> 00:01:55.070
So these are the leading scientists from 1660 onwards.

31
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.990
And the book is a continuous record of all of the fellows of the Royal

32
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:02.570
society. We wanted two notable exceptions.

33
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.000
And if you examine this page,

34
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.190
you'll immediately begin to see the great scientists of the 17th

35
00:02:10.191 --> 00:02:11.024
century.

36
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.420
<v 0>Here we got there. Then here we go. Robert hook down at the bottom.</v>

37
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.430
<v 2>Squeezed into the foot of the page. Yes, John Wallace here. And, uh,</v>

38
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.730
John Wilkins, Christopher Wren's on this page as well.

39
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.540
<v 0>Christopher Wren who built some Paul's cathedral in London.</v>

40
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.920
<v 2>That's absolutely right.</v>

41
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.830
Well then let's turn the page and see if we can see Newton.

42
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.600
And here he is quite quite a small Sydney.

43
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.643
<v 1>Sure.</v>

44
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.830
<v 2>And you can see immediately the man under Isaac Newton is, uh,</v>

45
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.100
being gradually, uh, raised because Newton's so popular.

46
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.760
People will point to his signature and run their fingers along it.

47
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.260
And therefore, um, it's just raising the ink from the surface of developed.

48
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.750
<v 0>People say, is that really Isaac Newton and rub out the poor guy underneath?</v>

49
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:56.000
Yeah.

50
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.430
<v 2>John [inaudible] the astronomer Royal, who is one of the, that you argued with.</v>

51
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.550
And it's interesting that he didn't put his name in the column.

52
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.490
He's put it slightly to one side and just above a Newton.

53
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.360
<v 0>Do you, is that just a coincidence or think.</v>

54
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.060
<v 2>It could be a coincidence, but it's, it's a,</v>

55
00:03:12.061 --> 00:03:16.590
it's a nice idea that he just might've decided to get one up on the great man.

56
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.540
This is Edmond Halley, uh, the astronomer sea captain mathematician,

57
00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:24.480
and many of the things beside we know how many signatures are in this book.

58
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.700
I don't think we've ever counted them. And, um, it's interesting, uh,

59
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.170
that, uh, some of them you can see have actually been crossed out.

60
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.880
That's probably non-payment of subscriptions to the role of society. There is,

61
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.320
uh, another Royal page since one of the Georgia's again,

62
00:03:43.321 --> 00:03:47.550
not terribly colorful, but we'll come to some really highly decorated pages,

63
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.940
quite suit. It is in its way,

64
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.320
an almost complete history of science it's stored in a

65
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.590
controlled environmental volts.

66
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.610
So it's brought out when fellows sign the book once a year,

67
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.820
new fellows in terms of its its value. Uh,

68
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.890
nothing like this as they'd been sold at auction.

69
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.210
So it's anybody's guess how much this would cost you. Uh,

70
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.920
but I can see here. Well, here's young Davey just being,

71
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.070
uh, elected a fellow of the Royal society, Humphrey David there.

72
00:04:20.071 --> 00:04:20.904
So he signed the book.

73
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.500
<v 0>This is John Dalton,</v>

74
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.600
who first propounded the theory of atoms in its modern form.

75
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.300
<v 2>Yeah. Okay. And this is, uh, uh, Royal page, uh,</v>

76
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.050
role play is created when a new Monarch is put on the throat.

77
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.630
They become patron of the Royal society.

78
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.590
As a serving Monarch is therefore a new page is created for them.

79
00:04:43.591 --> 00:04:45.930
This is William. This is Charles Darwin.

80
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.680
<v 0>I think scientists already famous when they sign the book.</v>

81
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.060
<v 2>Uh, not necessarily Darwin is elected in</v>

82
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.640
1839. Uh,

83
00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.920
so 20 years before on the origin of species is,

84
00:05:00.921 --> 00:05:03.150
is written and published. Uh,

85
00:05:03.151 --> 00:05:07.950
at this stage he's just returned from his beagle voyage and he's

86
00:05:07.951 --> 00:05:11.430
sorting out specimens and beginning to, uh,

87
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.460
lecture and talk about what he's seen on his voyages.

88
00:05:14.461 --> 00:05:18.110
So he's not really at the point where he's a, uh,

89
00:05:18.111 --> 00:05:22.950
a leading scientist. So he's still quite a young figure.

90
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.500
Uh, but what there are site he is very good at is recognizing potential and

91
00:05:28.501 --> 00:05:30.300
backing winners, but he queen Victoria.

92
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.080
<v 3>Um.</v>

93
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.820
<v 2>It is a whole swathe of scientific endeavor in one</v>

94
00:05:38.821 --> 00:05:41.070
volume here we have, uh,

95
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.890
it's a signature of one of the most famous American scientists.

96
00:05:43.891 --> 00:05:45.960
This is Benjamin Franklin. Of course,

97
00:05:45.961 --> 00:05:49.860
he lived in London and he was on council of the Royal society.

98
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.360
<v 0>Every time I look at it,</v>

99
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.160
I find new signatures and this is really as close as one can

100
00:05:56.161 --> 00:06:01.010
get to of these scientists to see something that's actually

101
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:05.120
been written by them. This one is one of my favorite signatures.

102
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.060
This is the signature of mental layer.

103
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.440
Every time there are Russian visitors, I showed them the signature.

104
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.620
<v 2>So the interests of balance here, we have Alfred Russell Wallace.</v>

105
00:06:17.621 --> 00:06:18.820
We saw Darwin's signature.

106
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.740
So here's the other big figure in the evolution story page

107
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.230
1901. And you have the four corners of empire here.

108
00:06:29.231 --> 00:06:34.210
So you have the ostrich kangaroo, all of these and elephant here, Beaver for.

109
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.880
<v 1>Canada, presumably rather fits right at the foot of this one.</v>

110
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.180
<v 0>George George is the future King Edward, the eighth,</v>

111
00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.760
who was only King for a short time before he emptied.

112
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:57.280
<v 2>So we're coming increasingly up-to-date this is the 20th century and two good</v>

113
00:06:57.281 --> 00:07:00.820
signatures at the top of this page is Sigmund Freud.

114
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.060
And the charter book was taken to him.

115
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.020
One of the very rare instances where that's happened, Freud, uh,

116
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.210
had gotten out of the continent.

117
00:07:10.211 --> 00:07:12.640
So this is the period when the Nazis were coming to power,

118
00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:17.080
he had to escape from his home, longtime home in Vienna,

119
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.160
and he ended up in London in Hampstead. Uh,

120
00:07:20.161 --> 00:07:24.340
so the charter book was taken to Hamstead for him to sign.

121
00:07:24.341 --> 00:07:26.380
He was quite infirm at that time.

122
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:31.630
And there are some nice photographs of Freud in the garden of his Hamstead home

123
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.470
with the charter book and look underneath. We've got Julian Huxley.

124
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.920
They're great, great scientific family, obviously, of course,

125
00:07:38.921 --> 00:07:43.840
a fantastic zoologist and a great figure in popularizing

126
00:07:43.841 --> 00:07:45.850
science. Here's max born.

127
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:46.953
<v 1>Good dad.</v>

128
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.660
<v 2>It's born of course is Einstein's great correspondent,</v>

129
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.910
a fantastic physicist.

130
00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.130
Einstein is one of those signatures we wish we had in the book and we don't know

131
00:08:00.131 --> 00:08:04.090
why the Royal society didn't manage to get him because he was a fellow.

132
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.790
He was a fellow, he was elected after his,

133
00:08:06.791 --> 00:08:10.930
his great works and the Nobel prize in 1921. Uh,

134
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:15.880
he was certainly in London, uh, during the 1930s and 1933.

135
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.320
Uh, but for some reason we didn't manage to get him for the charter book.

136
00:08:20.321 --> 00:08:22.600
And then off, he went to the U S of course.

137
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.130
<v 0>This is Niels Bohr,</v>

138
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:29.050
the first person to apply quantum ideas to the structure of the atom.

139
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.970
<v 2>So this is 1945. The first women were elected to the Royal society. Uh,</v>

140
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:38.680
there were two of them, Kathleen Lawnsdale and Midori Stevenson. Uh,

141
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.980
Lonsdale is the one people have really heard of. Uh,

142
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.680
so here's Kathleen Lonsdale. So here's my jury.

143
00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.750
Stevenson's who else do we have here? Well, here's his bones Wallace of,

144
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.030
of bouncing bomb of fame on the same page.

145
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:57.450
<v 0>And here we have Glenn Seaborg after the elements see Bogan was named</v>

146
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.080
and who also discovered a lot of the trends you write in, in my ligaments.

147
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.983
<v 2>Is Frank whittle.</v>

148
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.710
The inventor of the jet engine is Linus Pauling down here is that

149
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.650
yes. And here's Dorothy Ball Needham.

150
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.930
<v 0>This is max from Lawan,</v>

151
00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.280
who was one of the people who was very important in the development of

152
00:09:19.281 --> 00:09:20.300
crystallography.

153
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.780
<v 2>Here we go. Now this is the current Royal page.</v>

154
00:09:23.781 --> 00:09:28.610
So the queen is our current patron is head of the list there,

155
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:32.390
but many of the Royals are on that page. So Prince Charles is on that.

156
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.553
<v 0>Prince William.</v>

157
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.073
So this year.

158
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:50.540
<v 2>Uh, so this is the Japanese and group. Who's very good Marine biologist.</v>

159
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:53.120
So he gets to sign. And, uh,

160
00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.050
I think we have Gustavo Sweden on there as well.

161
00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:02.570
<v 0>Lisa Meitner the woman scientist after whom element</v>

162
00:10:02.571 --> 00:10:06.020
109 was named Peter Higgs

163
00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.260
signature gives mass to the book

164
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:18.740
and says almost next door to Margaret Thatcher,

165
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.050
who is prime minister was elected.

166
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:26.660
She calls the big row and no prime minister has been elected since then

167
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:31.220
on the cruise, under it. And underneath is David Attenborough,

168
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.350
the world famous naturalists.

169
00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:38.180
<v 2>You get pages where you get four or five fantastically,</v>

170
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:42.590
big figures, uh, and you know, it's, it's, one's better than the next almost.

171
00:10:42.591 --> 00:10:44.900
So you do get very, very excited when you're looking at it.

172
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:46.340
If here's another famous name,

173
00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.390
w what was the experience like of actually signing the book?

174
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:55.850
<v 0>I w I must say I was quite nervous and you can see it's not a</v>

175
00:10:55.851 --> 00:11:00.320
very elegant signature, but I didn't at least blocked it,

176
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.530
even though my name's in the same book as Charles Darwin,

177
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:04.970
with some of these other people,

178
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:08.540
when couldn't possibly imagine that I'm on the same level as them,

179
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.540
but it's still quite nice to be recognized.

180
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:14.540
<v 2>This is the end of the book. Well, not quite the end of the book.</v>

181
00:11:14.541 --> 00:11:19.070
So this is the last input intake of fellows of the Royal

182
00:11:19.071 --> 00:11:22.220
society from, from last year, from 2013.

183
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:26.120
Now you can see, uh, there are blank spaces here.

184
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.470
There's a blank space for the obligation or task to be written in and columns

185
00:11:30.471 --> 00:11:35.030
and columns of vellum waiting to be filled up. Uh, and this,

186
00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.180
we hope will be the great scientists of the future.

187
00:11:38.181 --> 00:11:42.230
So if you're looking at this movie, uh,

188
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:47.630
is that you are you one day going to be in the pages of the Royal

189
00:11:47.631 --> 00:11:50.630
society as a signature and its charter book.

190
00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.950
You'll have to be very good to get there, but in a way,

191
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.800
that's an incentive to do great science.

192
00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:16.950
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>
