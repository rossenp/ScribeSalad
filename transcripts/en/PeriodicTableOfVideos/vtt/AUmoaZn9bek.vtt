1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.300
<v 0>Nickel is element number 28,</v>

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.250
between cobalt 27 and copper 29.

3
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.460
Nickel has been known for a long time as an element or the mixture with other

4
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:15.294
metals,

5
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.250
but it was only isolated as an element in 1751 by

6
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.600
Axel Friedrich,

7
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.670
crunched it in Sweden to begin with it didn't have really much

8
00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:27.330
use.

9
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.160
And the big breakthrough for nickel came in the 19th century.

10
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.960
When it was discovered that if you added an eco to steel,

11
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.750
you could make very strong armor,

12
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.030
particularly armor plates for ships so that your ship was

13
00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:49.950
stronger than the enemies and their cells couldn't penetrate about the

14
00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:54.450
same time, a large deposit of nickel or nickel,

15
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.070
or was discovered in Sudbury, in Ontario and Canada.

16
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.870
So that in some ways nickel has become a Canadian

17
00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:07.440
element. There are also no large deposits in Russia,

18
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.120
but the Canadians have become so proud of nickel, Axel, Friedrich,

19
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.050
crunched it,

20
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.820
his portraits is on the premiere metal of the Canadian Institute of

21
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:18.690
chemistry.

22
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.850
It is thought that the nickel deposits in Canada probably came with a meteorite

23
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.530
from outer space because meteorites quite often

24
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.630
have a very high nickel content.

25
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.580
And presumably in the very distant past a massive meter rate

26
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.530
struck what is now Canada and buried itself in the Sudbury

27
00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:45.330
region, you don't need a very large diameter to meet, to write,

28
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.000
to contain an awful lot of metal.

29
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.590
The big breakthrough in the refining of nickel came in

30
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.870
1890. When the British chemist Ludvik Mons,

31
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.570
who was a major industrialists,

32
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.280
had a problem in his chemical works that some of the

33
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.690
nickel valves on his chemical plants were found to corrode

34
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.540
dissolve, and he discovered,

35
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.250
or his assistant clinker discovered that this was caused by reaction

36
00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:21.060
between carbon monoxide and nickel in 1890,

37
00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:24.270
they published the key paper about the compound.

38
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.690
The compound is called nickel Tetra combination.

39
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.280
It consists of essential NIC LATAM surrounded by four carbon

40
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:35.340
monoxide groups arranged in the tetrahedron.

41
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.230
What made this compound really unusual is that when you think about

42
00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:43.680
transition metals, iron copper, nickel,

43
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.780
you think of colored salts, which are solid all the time.

44
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.780
Nickel Campanile was a liquid.

45
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.430
It was colorless and it boiled at 43 degrees centigrade.

46
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.440
So it was almost a gas at room temperature.

47
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.210
The important thing about nickel Campanile is that you can distill it

48
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:05.950
easily. And if you heat it up,

49
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.180
it decomposes back into nickel and carbon monoxide.

50
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.040
So it turned out to be really good way of purifying nickel

51
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.080
or Amman set up a company specifically to get

52
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.440
nickel from the oars in Sudbury.

53
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.440
So he was reacting your with carbon monoxide,

54
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.340
which extracted out the nickel. And in fact, some of the iron,

55
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.280
both as these so-called carbonated compounds,

56
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.070
you can then separate them by distillation,

57
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.050
heat them up to decompose them and you get absolutely pure nickel and

58
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:42.340
some iron as well.

59
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.380
It was then discovered that nickel was a very good catalyst

60
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.370
for reacting organic compounds with hydrogen.

61
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.750
And particularly it was discovered that you put hydrogenate

62
00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.070
vegetable oils, sort of cooking oils that you use.

63
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.990
And these oils have carbon carbon, double bonds.

64
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.690
If you react these with hydrogen,

65
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.380
the melting point of the oils increases.

66
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.830
So the material becomes more like butter,

67
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.480
and this is how you make March serene by reacting vegetable oil

68
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.830
with hydrogen. The nickel is the catalyst.

69
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.970
The hydrogen is absorbed onto the surface of nickel.

70
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.340
The organic compounds also absorbed on the surface

71
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.610
and when the molecules are held there,

72
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.680
the hydrogen can transfer from the nickel onto the carbon of

73
00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:42.514
the double bond.

74
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.680
I was very keen to do a big experiments

75
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.890
demonstration in this video.

76
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.550
And I wanted to do it with a material called rainy.

77
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.710
Nicole Marie Rainey was an American chemist working on the

78
00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:12.270
hydrogenation of fats, trying to make a better catalyst.

79
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.520
And the problem with the catalyst is because it is solid and the

80
00:05:17.521 --> 00:05:20.640
molecules are absorbing on the surface, the bigger,

81
00:05:20.641 --> 00:05:24.720
the surface area within reason, the better the catalyst.

82
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.670
So he needed some way of dividing up the nickel.

83
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.100
So it was in very small particles.

84
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.720
So it had a very large surface area and he hit on the idea of

85
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.790
mixing molten,

86
00:05:38.791 --> 00:05:42.000
aluminum and molten nickel,

87
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.950
these melted metals,

88
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.590
and they mix when they are liquid, but when they solidify,

89
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.000
they separate.

90
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.810
So you end up with a lump of aluminum,

91
00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.080
with tiny bits of nickel embedded in the

92
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:02.990
solid, rather like currents or cherries in the cake.

93
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.360
You can then put these mixed nickel,

94
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.900
aluminum pellets into sodium hydroxide.

95
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:26.643
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

96
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.920
<v 0>The sodium hydroxide dissolves the Ellie minium,</v>

97
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.990
rather like we've done before with Coke cans and they

98
00:06:46.991 --> 00:06:50.230
leave the nickel quite untouched,

99
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.180
but they come out like removing the cherries from the cake

100
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.730
and they have a very low surface area.

101
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:20.380
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

102
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.910
<v 0>So now my experiments,</v>

103
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.830
I had read that Raney nickel is para

104
00:07:26.831 --> 00:07:31.210
Foric. It reacts with oxygen, the air and burst into flames.

105
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:36.240
So I went to talk to my colleagues in organic chemistry who use Raymond

106
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.730
nickel and you buy it as a slurry.

107
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:43.480
So it's wet to avoid it bursting into flames.

108
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.810
So I got a bottle which looked a bit old,

109
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.300
but I was assured was probably okay.

110
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.160
And I persuaded Neil to pour it onto a filter paper.

111
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:59.230
And so what I expected was that it would dry out and then you

112
00:07:59.231 --> 00:08:02.590
would be left with these dry, tiny particles of nickel,

113
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.380
which would absorb oxygen,

114
00:08:05.381 --> 00:08:09.580
start burning heat up more and more and burst into spectacular flames.

115
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.410
Unfortunately, it didn't. In fact,

116
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:22.750
when Neil eventually set fire to the filter paper and the

117
00:08:22.751 --> 00:08:24.310
nickel didn't seem to burn,

118
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.450
clearly we had the data batch.

119
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.310
I think that the air had got in and slowly dissolved in the water and

120
00:08:39.311 --> 00:08:43.420
reacted over a period of months and oxidized the nickel.

121
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:47.290
So probably what we had was some form of nickel oxide,

122
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.620
but they're all fairly black and colors.

123
00:08:49.621 --> 00:08:51.550
So you can't really tell what you've got.

124
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:56.460
So I rushed off and found another professor who had much fresher sample

125
00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:01.590
and he came down with his sample and he told us we had to dry it on a hot

126
00:09:01.591 --> 00:09:04.710
plate. And he got quite worried thought,

127
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:09.450
we'd use rather a lot of nickel. We heated it up. We had all the cameras,

128
00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:10.380
the GoPro,

129
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.270
the thermal camera braids is standing there so excited

130
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.870
and eventually it loads likely.

131
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.900
And what this demonstrates is that sometimes

132
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:30.300
what chemists tell you about reactions are not

133
00:09:30.301 --> 00:09:33.690
always what's happens in the lab. However,

134
00:09:33.691 --> 00:09:38.070
you've got to imagine that if you're making margarine on a huge

135
00:09:38.071 --> 00:09:41.880
scale, tens of thousands of tons,

136
00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:44.400
and they've got a huge amount of rainy nickel,

137
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:47.940
then probably you can get quite a serious fire,

138
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.710
but we don't have that much rain in nickel. And we don't want the series foam.

139
00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:00.200
So well, first of all, let's look at some nickel.

140
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.710
Neil has produced some Nick pellets.

141
00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.480
So these are just labeled as general purpose nickel.

142
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:09.950
They're lumps of nickel,

143
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:14.570
quite a few chemists like to use nickels bachelor's

144
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.970
because they are more resistant to strong acids

145
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:24.500
than stainless steel ones. You can have over here.

146
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:25.790
This is quite nice.

147
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:30.650
This is doors that is made of very fine

148
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:35.240
nickel whales. I think this one is designed for electric chemistry.

149
00:10:35.241 --> 00:10:38.480
So you can get a very high surface area.

150
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:44.090
Nicholas has also been used quite often for electroplating

151
00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:49.130
in the days when cars had shiny bumpers.

152
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:54.380
I can't remember what to American school bumpers fenders and

153
00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:58.580
these consisted of steel, which were plated with nickel.

154
00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.960
And on top of the nickel was chromium. So the chromium gave a nice,

155
00:11:02.961 --> 00:11:06.950
shiny look, but the Nicole bonded them together.

156
00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:10.430
<v 2>Nickel.</v>

157
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:15.230
<v 0>Has very colorful salts and our</v>

158
00:11:15.231 --> 00:11:20.090
undergraduates in their first year do a very nice experiment where they

159
00:11:20.091 --> 00:11:22.520
take nickel chloride that is green,

160
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:28.040
and they react this with ammonia so that

161
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:33.050
each Nicole LATAM is surrounded by six ammonia.

162
00:11:33.051 --> 00:11:37.880
Atoms. The nickel ammonia complex is a nice purple color.

163
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:43.190
They then have to do a separate experiment to measure how much nickel

164
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.860
is in the sample to see if they made it properly.

165
00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:49.130
They do this by dissolving up their nice to put a compound,

166
00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.490
adding an organic compound called Damien,

167
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.900
which binds to the nickel and forms an insoluble red

168
00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.890
precipitate,

169
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:04.510
which they filter off and way so they can see how much nickel there is in their

170
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:07.390
compounds. So in a single experiment,

171
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:10.930
they have gone from green to purple to red.

172
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:15.880
We're not showing you the experiment because then those students might cheat.

173
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.330
So you'll have to come as a student to do it yourself.

174
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:23.880
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

175
00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.290
<v 0>Then Neil thought about it.</v>

176
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:30.420
He realized that as the water was evaporating and the individual

177
00:12:30.421 --> 00:12:34.200
particles of nickel got dry, each of them oxidized.

178
00:12:34.201 --> 00:12:37.440
So you've never had a whole mass going off at once.

179
00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:43.560
So what he decided was to put the wet rainy nickel

180
00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.380
in a vacuum desiccated.

181
00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:51.330
This is a vessel which you can pump out all the air and as you're pumping on it,

182
00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:54.060
of course the water also evaporates,

183
00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:59.250
but the nickel is dried in a vacuum. So there's no oxygen for it to react with.

184
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:04.170
So when you open the tap, the air containing the oxygen rushed in

185
00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:12.090
and all the nickel reacted at the same time and produced quite a satisfying

186
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:13.463
Bush.

187
00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.460
<v 3>Video is about every element on the periodic table.</v>

188
00:13:17.461 --> 00:13:19.500
If you'd like to watch them in order,

189
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:23.250
I'll put a link on the screen and in the video description as a playlist of the

190
00:13:23.251 --> 00:13:26.220
mole, one to 118 might take you a little while.

191
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.950
We're constantly updating these videos with new ones,

192
00:13:28.951 --> 00:13:31.560
like the nickel video you just watched. And in fact,

193
00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:34.140
we've filmed so much about nickel. There's some leftovers.

194
00:13:34.141 --> 00:13:37.440
If you'd like to watch them, I'm also linking to the extra footage.

195
00:13:37.441 --> 00:13:40.350
You can go and check out even more details that professor had to share.
