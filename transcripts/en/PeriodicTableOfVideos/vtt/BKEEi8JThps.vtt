1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.380
<v 0>So now's the time to put in your bed for the name for element</v>

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.940
117.

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.280
I think it would be really good to name an element after Richard Fineman.

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.780
So you could have the element find Manian with the

5
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:19.980
element symbol. I think F Y would be quite nice.

6
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.820
I'm particularly excited about element 117.

7
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.680
You mind tell us why,

8
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.660
but 117 was the only element in the periodic table.

9
00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:38.310
When we started this project, when nobody had even seen one atom,

10
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.360
it's never been observed in any form at all.

11
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.780
So the field's way wide open.

12
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.710
And I thought that it would be quite impossible to make a video.

13
00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:54.420
When we were making videos about each element about an element when nobody had

14
00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:55.890
even seen one atom,

15
00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.630
this arrangement just seems to fall to bits before it can properly form.

16
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.640
Then about three years ago, our first video wasn't very good.

17
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.880
There was an exciting result from Russia,

18
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.740
from [inaudible] where they synthesized the first

19
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.580
atoms of element 117.

20
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.060
<v 1>No, no, it's really exciting because it's, it's,</v>

21
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.850
it's the generation of new matter. You know,

22
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.610
it's almost like a chill goes up your spine. It's like, wow, something new,

23
00:01:25.611 --> 00:01:26.750
something really exciting.

24
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.030
<v 0>Those of you who've watched our videos for a long time will know that if you</v>

25
00:01:32.031 --> 00:01:35.930
want to synthesize a new element and have your experiments

26
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.510
accepted, you have to wait until somebody else has repeated the experiments,

27
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.340
done it a different way and got the same result. Otherwise anybody could say,

28
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.060
Oh, I've seen an atom of elements. So-and-so in fact,

29
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.210
there has been the case with element 118,

30
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.770
where somebody did cheat and the first results were wrong

31
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.280
and were faked. I've explained several times,

32
00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:05.270
and you may have seen some of the videos, how you make these elements.

33
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.040
You take a sample of a really quite heavy element and the heavier the better,

34
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.290
and then bombard it with atoms of a lighter element,

35
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.520
which you accelerate really fast after days.

36
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.240
Perhaps they stick together and you make a big

37
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.380
atom. In the case of elements, 117,

38
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.520
you choose elements where the atomic numbers,

39
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.260
when you add them together, add up to 117. In this case,

40
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.490
they used an element 97,

41
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.510
but helium and calcium,

42
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.550
which is element number 2020 plus 97 makes 117.

43
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.740
And the atoms of calcium were accelerated in a huge accelerator in

44
00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:59.210
Germany at the GSI in dumb start to speed. That's about a 10th,

45
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.790
the speed of light and banged into the sound pool of berkelium and

46
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.620
created a few atoms.

47
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.350
Now the technical problem is that berkelium itself is a highly

48
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:15.700
radioactive and unstable element and in a very productive

49
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.550
demonstration of international collaboration,

50
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.530
the berkelium was made in America in the Oak Ridge

51
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.550
national lab, and then 13 milligrams.

52
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.930
That's a tiny bit,

53
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.460
just almost too small to see just a few

54
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.860
grains were transported to Germany in order to do

55
00:03:38.861 --> 00:03:41.980
this, you can't just have a lump of berkelium.

56
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.620
You have to have one particular isotope,

57
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:47.830
a single mass of berkelium.

58
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.810
They had the berkelium two 49 and this sample was

59
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:56.650
transported to Germany and it's radioactive.

60
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.530
It has a half-life of 330 days.

61
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:04.510
So it means every 330 days half of it, the K's away.

62
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.920
So not only is it radioactive, but you will have to work quite quickly.

63
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.540
All your valuable sample is gone before you get round to doing the experiment.

64
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.780
So they did the experiment.

65
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.460
The berkelium was made in the Oak Ridge national lab transported to Germany,

66
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.560
and then it was bombarded with calcium atoms

67
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.030
and they looked for the signals for the decay of element

68
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:32.170
117.

69
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.510
And they sold signals corresponding to the sorts of decays that are here on my

70
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:42.430
tie from earlier radioactive elements they've made.

71
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.440
And the way these elements decay is that they give off alpha particles.

72
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.620
These are nuclear ive, helium atoms,

73
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.610
and the mass changes in steps of four.

74
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.410
So the mass goes down by four units and it transforms one element

75
00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:00.880
into another. And in fact,

76
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.870
they discovered some quite interesting isotopes of other elements that were

77
00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:08.350
formed, which had never been observed before during this decay.

78
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.210
<v 2>Kelly, Ms. Such a pain in the backside, and I have to get this tiny sample,</v>

79
00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:15.000
which decays away. Why not let you use different elements?

80
00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:17.730
Why did they use 50 and 67?

81
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.490
<v 0>I think the reason that they use these pretty light atoms is that if they get</v>

82
00:05:23.491 --> 00:05:28.020
used bigger than bigger atoms for the collision,

83
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.850
there's a likelihood that everything will smash up because the smaller elements

84
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.710
are inherently stronger and they don't fragment when they hit the targets.

85
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.880
And so I think if you used, um,

86
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.630
57 and 60,

87
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.500
you just end up with a fantastic mess of fragments going everywhere.

88
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.280
You might make the old datum of 117,

89
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.070
but it would be lost in the noise with everything else.

90
00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.070
So the next is the to committee joint committee of the

91
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:05.420
international union of pure and applied chemistry. And the corresponding,

92
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:10.250
one of physics has to decide whether the evidence is really good enough.

93
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.010
If everybody's happy, then there's the exciting thing.

94
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.590
They choose the name for the element,

95
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.860
the people who get the honor,

96
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.920
those that discover the element originally.

97
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.510
I'm not sure whether this will be counted as the Russians or the

98
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.140
Germans, but I suspect that everybody will sit down together.

99
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.430
And there was a huge team working on the latest project.

100
00:06:37.431 --> 00:06:41.420
I think more than 70 scientists from all sorts of different countries.

101
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.980
And so now I'm going to put in my bit,

102
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:51.590
I think it would be really good to name an element after Richard Fineman,

103
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.820
who was a physicist who worked on the Manhattan project.

104
00:06:55.821 --> 00:07:00.560
So he has connections with the Oak Ridge lamp where the berkelium was

105
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.400
married,

106
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.350
but he's also a huge figure in modern nanotechnology

107
00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:09.770
and a founder of much of the research that is being done now.

108
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:14.390
So you could have the element find Manian with the

109
00:07:14.391 --> 00:07:19.340
element symbol. I think F Y would be quite nice. Um,

110
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.780
and that would also serve another purpose because when you see Fireman's name

111
00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:24.710
written down,

112
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.510
a lot of people are not sure whether you should pronounce it Fineman or Feynman,

113
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.160
but if the element symbol is F Y they will all know it has to be pronounced

114
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:39.080
fine. So my bid for this name is find my name.

115
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.500
<v 2>A group of Russians and Germans.</v>

116
00:07:41.501 --> 00:07:43.600
Aren't going to name it after an American though, are they?

117
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.210
<v 0>I think it's quite possible that they would,</v>

118
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:53.980
because after all the Germans named element

119
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:58.960
112 after Copernicus who was Polish,

120
00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:04.030
and I think we have got to the stage now where elements are being

121
00:08:04.031 --> 00:08:08.920
named after figures or places that have a world

122
00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:13.810
role and nationalism is going

123
00:08:13.811 --> 00:08:14.260
away.

124
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:19.240
And I certainly think that anybody who's write anything

125
00:08:19.241 --> 00:08:23.170
about Fineman could imagine that he was a typical

126
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:28.570
citizen of any country. He is about the most unconventional,

127
00:08:28.571 --> 00:08:33.370
the scientist that is lived in the last hundred years and also

128
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.980
one of the really influential ones as well.

129
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.160
<v 2>The professor for the last year or two though,</v>

130
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:44.290
I've heard you advocating the name plank diem. We still haven't got Planky. Um,

131
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.170
have you, have you abandoned your love of the idea of plank Hill?

132
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.450
<v 0>I still like the name plank, Tim,</v>

133
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.980
but there's another element still hundred and 1,513.

134
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:58.920
So there's still, um, opportunities and of course, 118 as well,

135
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.620
but hundreds and 17 is an odd number and it's good to name an

136
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.140
odd element. After an old scientist.

137
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.230
<v 3>I've already got the prize. The prize is the pleasure of finding the thing out,</v>

138
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:16.250
the kick and the discovery, the observation other people use it.

139
00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:21.440
Those are the real things. The honors are unreal to me.

140
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.390
I don't believe in honors.
