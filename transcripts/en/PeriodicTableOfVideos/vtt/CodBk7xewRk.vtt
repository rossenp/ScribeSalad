00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.100
<v 0>I'm here at the joint Institute for nuclear research in Dubliner</v>

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.060
in Russia,

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.130
the place where so many of the super heavy elements

4
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.540
have been created.

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.940
And I'm going to show you an absolutely key component for making

6
00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:18.990
those elements.

7
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.880
And it's also probably the most expensive compound you've ever seen.

8
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.460
And the sample and get to show you is here on the table.

9
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.570
In many of our videos about these heavy elements,

10
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.070
we've talked about accelerating a light element onto a

11
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:41.820
target and creating the super-heavy elements,

12
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.890
but we've usually wrote the dismissed what the light element is.

13
00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:50.630
We've said, well, it's calcium plus elements,

14
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.890
calcium 2020 plus ninety-five makes

15
00:00:54.891 --> 00:00:55.970
115.

16
00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.710
It is actually a very special [inaudible] isotope of calcium called

17
00:01:00.711 --> 00:01:04.550
calcium 48. It occurs naturally,

18
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.490
but in a very, very small abundance.

19
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.930
So it has to be separated from the other isotopes,

20
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.780
the other atoms of calcium,

21
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.430
and because calcium doesn't have any compounds that the

22
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.220
gaseous, it literally has to be separated atom by atom in the

23
00:01:25.221 --> 00:01:30.020
large magnetic separator. And so it is very expensive.

24
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.280
So here we have calcium carbonate,

25
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.540
but which just contains calcium 48.

26
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.410
It's so valuable. And my hand shakes so much,

27
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.580
I'm not allowed to touch it. But here with this pen,

28
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.280
you can see the approximate scale.

29
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.230
There are two grams of calcium carbonate here, which have worth,

30
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.090
or at least if you wanted to buy,

31
00:01:56.091 --> 00:02:00.410
it would cost you about half a million dollars.

32
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.510
This is $250 for a milligram milligrams.

33
00:02:05.511 --> 00:02:10.100
About the smallest amounts you can see easily. You're paying for the calcium,

34
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.990
the carbon dioxide and oxygen can free. All things come with a bonus.

35
00:02:14.991 --> 00:02:18.830
When you buy them in the supermarket. If you buy calcium 48,

36
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.510
you get the company free.

37
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.950
The reason why it is so expensive is because you have to

38
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.780
produce ions of calcium by heating it to very,

39
00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:34.100
very high temperature and then separating it in a high

40
00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:37.550
vacuum, under a magnetic field.

41
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.110
And so you need a very big piece of operators with huge.

42
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.980
Electromagnets using a vast amount of electricity.

43
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.290
And apparently the industrial scale production of this material is

44
00:02:51.291 --> 00:02:52.910
10 grams year.

45
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.130
So they produce about five times as much as you can see in this

46
00:02:58.131 --> 00:02:59.980
bottle in a year,

47
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.820
this isotope is only used in nuclear physics.

48
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.830
And most of it is used for synthesizing super-heavy elements.

49
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.660
It is only made in one place in the world.

50
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.310
The so-called,

51
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.530
the electric combine electric convene that which is in a town called

52
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.400
[inaudible]

53
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.400
, which is about 200 kilometers North of the big city Katrine book in the Euro

54
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.400
 mountains. So there's a monopoly supplier, but if you want to make money making calcium 48 is probably not the market 

55
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.233
that you should go in for, because there's so few custom.

56
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.320
<v 1>You can't use calcium carbonate.</v>

57
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.460
<v 0>In the accelerators. You need to use calcium metal.</v>

58
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.140
There is some quite interesting and simple stage chemistry.

59
00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.150
First of all, you heat the calcium carbonate to drive off the carbon dioxide.

60
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.100
The second stage involves a variation of

61
00:04:05.101 --> 00:04:08.040
the so-called thermite reaction, which we have shown you.

62
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.963
<v 1>Before.</v>

63
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.350
<v 0>You mix the calcium oxide with Allie minium powder</v>

64
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.060
and heat them up.

65
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.590
And the aluminum powder reacts with the oxygen because it has a

66
00:04:22.591 --> 00:04:27.120
stronger affinity for the oxygen and the calcium, the calcium metal,

67
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.520
this tiny sample or sample of calcium 48 is then put

68
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.150
into the iron source of the cyclotron.

69
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.870
This is where they make the calcium ions.

70
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.500
The iron source then generates calcium ions,

71
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.690
which are accelerated up to about a 10th of the speed of light and smashed into

72
00:04:48.691 --> 00:04:49.560
the target.

73
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.810
The operators runs at a rate of about one

74
00:04:54.811 --> 00:04:58.170
milligram of calcium 48 per hour.

75
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.460
So here we have two grams of calcium

76
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.540
carbonate,

77
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.890
which is probably one and a half grams of calcium

78
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.410
metal, or perhaps a little less.

79
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.420
So this is enough to run for more than a thousand hours of

80
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.680
cyclotron time,

81
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.480
but you can see what this sort of price it's an expensive experiment,

82
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.970
but the other cost of running the cyclotron are also large.

83
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.230
So even if you've spent half a million dollars on buying this,

84
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.910
you still have to spend some more money to start synthesizing your

85
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.770
super heavy elements.

86
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.720
You might ask yourself what is special about calcium 48,

87
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.910
that people go to all this trouble,

88
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.440
whereas they could get tons of the cheaper calcium for the same price.

89
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.450
The answer is that calcium 48 has the

90
00:05:54.451 --> 00:05:57.740
largest excess of neutrons.

91
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.970
Calcium is atomic number 20. So it has 20 protons.

92
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.230
And because it's 48, it has 28 neutrons.

93
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.170
When you're making a super heavy element,

94
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.330
the more nutrients you can get into the final

95
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.850
nucleus of the heavy element,

96
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.900
the more likely it is to be stable by and large,

97
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.310
the number of neutrons in the target nucleus is fixed.

98
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.540
So you want to choose the light element,

99
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.550
the project projectile to be containing as many nutrients

100
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:35.443
as possible.

101
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.120
Now you don't have much choice because the identity of the elements is

102
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:45.760
dictated by the number of protons. If you want to add 20 to the,

103
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.970
to your atomic number of your target, you have to use calcium.

104
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.280
So you want the calcium isotope that has the most neutrons and the

105
00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:59.300
number of neutrons and number of protons in calcium, uh,

106
00:06:59.301 --> 00:07:03.740
both so-called magic numbers for particularly stable nucleus.

107
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.360
So 28 is a magic number for neutrons 24

108
00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:09.194
protons.

109
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.640
So calcium 48 is a double magic nucleus.

110
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.500
You can't get better than that.

111
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:20.480
And when you bang the projectile into the target,

112
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.720
if the two nuclides fuse together,

113
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:29.240
then the nucleus still has a lot of energy and it loses

114
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.590
part of that energy as neutrons coming out.

115
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.350
And because you've got lots of neutrons,

116
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:41.180
you'll still have plenty left in the final nucleus and

117
00:07:41.181 --> 00:07:45.890
calcium 48 has been the absolute key to the success

118
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.610
of the sentences of these super heavy elements in Duke now,

119
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:55.100
which is why they are the principle customer for the production

120
00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.350
of the calcium 48.

121
00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:01.160
The problem is for future synthesis of elements,

122
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.960
is that the highest atomic number of any target that has been

123
00:08:05.961 --> 00:08:10.280
successfully used so far is 98, California.

124
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:15.410
So you can see just words relevant, 118 calcium,

125
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:19.580
20 California, 98, put them together.

126
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.110
You get 118,

127
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.700
but if you want like 119 or 120,

128
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.990
you've got to go to a heavier projectile.

129
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:34.970
The scientists working here looking at titanium 50,

130
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.880
but to attain him 50 is not as good as calcium 48.

131
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.710
It doesn't have a magic number.

132
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:47.180
So they're going to have to build a much more sensitive operators.

133
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:52.280
If they have any chance of success in detecting the new elements,

134
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:57.940
doesn't stick and you go on throwing and throwing more and

135
00:08:57.941 --> 00:09:02.560
more. And eventually after days,

136
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:07.270
perhaps they stick together and you make a big

137
00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:07.780
item.
