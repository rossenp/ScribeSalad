00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.450
<v 0>There's a really exciting thing in this books.</v>

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.460
Something that I never thought I would ever see. So we look inside.

3
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:16.603
<v 1>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.160
<v 0>So we'll, you can see straight away that it's black, the,</v>

5
00:00:21.161 --> 00:00:25.940
the outside is just some perspex lucites as you call it in

6
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.890
American, which is holding this black piece inside. And it's the black piece.

7
00:00:30.891 --> 00:00:33.470
That's exciting. If you look at it a bit more,

8
00:00:33.471 --> 00:00:37.520
you can probably guess that it's carbon. And if you know about carbon,

9
00:00:37.521 --> 00:00:42.140
you can probably guess that it's graphite because it's obviously not diamond.

10
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.510
This is a piece of graphite from the world's very first

11
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.580
nuclear reactor that was built under the sports stadium

12
00:00:52.581 --> 00:00:56.270
at stake field in Chicago, in the United States,

13
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.650
and went operational, went critical for the first time.

14
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.620
On the 2nd of December, 1942.

15
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.880
Think back from moments in the early 1940s,

16
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.860
there was a race to try and build an atom bomb and to try and

17
00:01:12.861 --> 00:01:16.130
demonstrate that nuclear reactors could work.

18
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.780
That uranium atoms could be split by neutrons.

19
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.050
And when they split, they would emit more neutrons.

20
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.150
So the number of neutrons would build up and up and up and eventually

21
00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:30.350
could lead to an explosion.

22
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.890
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

23
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.760
<v 0>The famous physicist in Ricoh family,</v>

24
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.210
who was at that time, working in Chicago,

25
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.210
built a so-called nuclear pile.

26
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.680
It was literally a pile of graphite blocks like this

27
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.940
with uranium oxide and uranium metal,

28
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.090
about five tons in all distributed within it.

29
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.540
So I don't have a very good model,

30
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.880
but this will have to do

31
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.960
the reactor was not round,

32
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.320
but with square and while they were building it,

33
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.960
they didn't want it to start reacting.

34
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.590
So they put into it control rods,

35
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.960
which could absorb neutrons.

36
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.480
They used a mixture of cadmium, indium, and silver.

37
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.890
The reason they chose silver was because silver can absorb neutrons and become

38
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.820
radioactive. So it connect rather like a neutron meter.

39
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.550
So once they had finished building this reactor,

40
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.010
they then started gently removing the roads.

41
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.060
And when they got the last road out,

42
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.220
suddenly the number of neutrons being emitted went up and up

43
00:02:55.221 --> 00:02:59.270
and up and they left it running, I think for 28 minutes.

44
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.100
And then they put the rods in back in again to cool it down

45
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.470
because they built this reactor with no shielding

46
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.420
with no cooling and in the middle of a really densely

47
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:18.040
populated area of the States. So if it's a blown up,

48
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.690
it would have been serious. The reactor ran for quite a short time,

49
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.620
a few months,

50
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.840
and then was moved to outside Chicago onto the

51
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:33.400
site of what later became the so-called Argonne national lab.

52
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.200
And in February,

53
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.450
I visited the algo national lab with the UK ministry of

54
00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:42.190
science, David Willets,

55
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.480
and he was leading the delegation and to

56
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.520
commemorate his visit, he was given this piece of graphite.

57
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.800
You can imagine how I felt this is something I really

58
00:03:56.801 --> 00:04:00.130
liked to have had I go to nice pen,

59
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.500
but I much rather have had the piece of graphite,

60
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.200
but he did say that I could borrow it to make a video. Of course,

61
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:10.150
Brady wasn't on the trip with me.

62
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.900
So I made the couple of not very good home videos myself.

63
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.670
So you can see the minister talking actually mentioning this

64
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.110
present that he was given.

65
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:25.110
<v 2>I was presented with a small piece of the graphite from that original</v>

66
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.350
nuclear reactor, which is a very special gift that I will treasure.

67
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.840
<v 0>I also went to visit the Henry Moore sculpture that has been built on the</v>

68
00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:38.190
site of where the nuclear reactor was originally built.

69
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.420
Unfortunately, they've built libraries and things around it.

70
00:04:42.421 --> 00:04:45.420
So it doesn't really give you much idea of the sports field.

71
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.470
And there was a lot of snow there as well, and it was very cold.

72
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.240
I think that it is extremely interesting

73
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.990
that this graphite has been preserved.

74
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.360
And I think at the time it was quite hard to get high enough purity

75
00:05:03.361 --> 00:05:07.500
graphite in that sort of quantity, many, many tons,

76
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.180
but you can see my reactors already collapsed.

77
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.820
Um, I think we should move it to the outside before it blows up.

78
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.780
This piece of graphites is really

79
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.740
symbolic of the whole nuclear age.

80
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.830
And it was the start, not only of the development of nuclear weapons,

81
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.920
but of the nuclear power stations,

82
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.690
which now supply a large proportion of the electricity in many

83
00:05:39.691 --> 00:05:41.280
countries across the world,

84
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.860
nuclear reactors still have problems in the sense that there

85
00:05:46.861 --> 00:05:51.660
is no elegant solution of what to do with the radioactive waste

86
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.040
that is produced by the reactors. As time goes on,

87
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.790
people develop number of technologies,

88
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.050
which will put the radioactive material into glass

89
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.550
separates off the useful components you will have seen.

90
00:06:07.551 --> 00:06:10.670
We visited the national nuclear laboratory,

91
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:13.340
where they had separated off I'm a risk Siham,

92
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.360
which can be used for smoke detectors and things like that.

93
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.720
Plutonium can be used to power satellites.

94
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:26.000
There are all sorts of very useful applications for small amounts of

95
00:06:26.001 --> 00:06:26.840
this material.

96
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.580
I sometimes wondered whether this will be radioactive,

97
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.350
but carbon is particularly useful

98
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.690
for nuclear reactors because it does not easily become radioactive.

99
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.700
It is in the thick layer of plastic.

100
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.680
So unless it was contaminated from some other radioactive

101
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.700
source, I think it's unlikely. This will be radioactive,

102
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.160
but perhaps we lost my colleague Steve,

103
00:06:55.161 --> 00:06:59.240
little to give it a quick check just in case before we give it back to the

104
00:06:59.241 --> 00:07:01.220
minister. Well,

105
00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:06.050
then we can decide it's we can be sure it will be safe to give it back to the

106
00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:09.530
minister. Are you going to give it back to him? Do you think you'll notice? Um,

107
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:16.250
well I saw him yesterday at another meeting in London

108
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.900
and his assistant of clad where it was.

109
00:07:20.901 --> 00:07:23.390
So I think I'm going to have to give it back,

110
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.020
but he may see the video and relent.
