00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.110
<v 0>Today's video is about milking the Thorim cow.</v>

2
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.000
It's an amazing piece of science. Before we start,

3
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.600
there are two or three things that I need to tell you so you can understand

4
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.460
quite how fantastic it is.

5
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.050
The first thing is that to treat cancer,

6
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.660
one can use highly radioactive atoms,

7
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.370
which are taken to the tumor by complexing them.

8
00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:37.080
That's binding them to a protein that is attracted to the

9
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:39.180
tumor rather than the rest of the body.

10
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.770
The second point is that when a radioactive element

11
00:00:46.771 --> 00:00:51.060
decays the products of the decay can be far more

12
00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:55.950
radioactive than the original atom that decays you can

13
00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:56.790
have theories.

14
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.020
That's not very radioactive decaying into something that's much more

15
00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:01.854
radioactive.

16
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.380
And the third point just before we start is that when you have a

17
00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:09.480
really radioactive atom,

18
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.060
even a nanogram that is 10 to the minus nine of a gram,

19
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.400
a thousand millionth of a gram has more than a hundred

20
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.870
times as many atoms as there are cells in your body.

21
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.330
So you need only a tiny amount of this highly radioactive material

22
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.330
to give a really big dose to the tumor.

23
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.980
So Brady was at the Oak Ridge national lab in Tennessee,

24
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:42.420
in United States.

25
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.020
And he was given a tour by Rose bowl,

26
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.120
who is an expert in the handling of these highly radioactive

27
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:51.960
elements.

28
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.430
<v 1>Uh, we are at building 79 20.</v>

29
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.930
This is the small hot cell room. We call them Ks.

30
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.070
This is where we do a lot of our medical isotope purification or the starting

31
00:02:04.071 --> 00:02:06.320
part of it. And we'll sell you the rest of it later.

32
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.410
Some of the material we work with is very highly radioactive.

33
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.070
And so we need shielding to protect us from the dose that comes from that

34
00:02:13.071 --> 00:02:16.880
material. So we work with it with remote handles.

35
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.640
This is Jay, who is doing the operation of the remote operators here.

36
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.250
We call them, um, manipulators.

37
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.950
And he's gonna show us the 3m two to nine cow that we use to milk

38
00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:32.420
our medical isotopes from.

39
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.870
<v 0>The guy who was doing it looked like a magician.</v>

40
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.860
It was amazing how he could manipulate these robot arms.

41
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.740
Do you think you'd be good at it? I'm sure I'd be terrible.

42
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.970
<v 1>Ethereum is dissolved in nitric acid. That's how we store it.</v>

43
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.610
We don't want to take it back to the solid.

44
00:02:49.611 --> 00:02:52.700
It becomes a very insoluble oxide.

45
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.910
So we keep it in liquid solution.

46
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.790
<v 0>Cow is a sample of Thorim two to nine.</v>

47
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.980
They thought it was just waste,

48
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.840
but then they suddenly realized this fantastic application and it's

49
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:12.790
called the cow because it keeps on giving more

50
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:14.020
and more active Liam,

51
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.070
just in the same way that a cow keeps on giving milk.

52
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.880
But the difference is you don't have to feed the Ethereum,

53
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.830
but you do have to feed the cow.

54
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.770
<v 1>Yeah, this is all material, but at the time that it was me,</v>

55
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.290
we didn't have a medical isotope application.

56
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.670
So this was something that would have been thrown away as waste material that we

57
00:03:44.671 --> 00:03:48.330
were able to go and recover. Something very useful out of it.

58
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.270
<v 0>Chemistry or perhaps the physics behind it is the Storium two</v>

59
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.120
29 gives out an alpha particle,

60
00:03:57.121 --> 00:04:00.300
which has mass four and contains two protons.

61
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.950
So you go to elements to the left, to radium,

62
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.330
and then the radium gives out to beat apart. Cool, that's an electron.

63
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.200
And it goes one element to the right and you get to 10 Liam,

64
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.490
two to five.

65
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.150
The first stage of the milking is to remove the Thorim from

66
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.920
solution so that you can then process the actinium.

67
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.870
And they do this with a resin solid acid,

68
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.410
which is something like this material here.

69
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.600
This is also a solid acid,

70
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.190
essentially tiny pellets of polystyrene,

71
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.030
which have been treated. So they have acid groups on it.

72
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.280
<v 1>He pulled that rack out off.</v>

73
00:04:44.281 --> 00:04:48.450
You notice it was up against the wall to start with our 3m.

74
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.900
We run it through that column to separate it from the actinium.

75
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.720
That's an anti an exchange column.

76
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.790
It has a glass frit on the top that holds the resin down for when we dump water

77
00:04:59.791 --> 00:05:04.140
on top, it doesn't disturb the resin bed. And, um,

78
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.520
it's stored with water on it right now until we go to do the next run,

79
00:05:08.521 --> 00:05:09.720
the next separation run.

80
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.310
No, not in that column. In fact, we keep our, uh,

81
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.510
radioactive material off of the column between runs because it,

82
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.130
the radiation will restore the residence.

83
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.350
<v 0>So now they have a solution which contains actinium and some</v>

84
00:05:28.351 --> 00:05:29.184
radium,

85
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.080
they put it through series of other columns to purify it with

86
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.920
raisins and they adjust the acidity of the solution. So that first,

87
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.520
all the radium is removed and eventually all they're left with is pure

88
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.600
actinium. Yeah.

89
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.940
<v 1>And today we're packaging it in small glass vials in order to</v>

90
00:05:50.941 --> 00:05:55.410
ship it to the customer. So over on this next place here,

91
00:05:55.411 --> 00:05:57.950
this is where they're doing the evaporation of the material.

92
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.440
<v 0>They are only going to produce a sample of about a nanogram and</v>

93
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.420
nanogram is such a small amount of material that you can't actually see it.

94
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.920
The problem is that whoever's going to buy it needs to know where it is.

95
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.720
So they use a bottle which has a V-shaped bottom

96
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.410
conical, bottom. So as you concentrate the liquid,

97
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.660
it goes right down to the bottom.

98
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.820
<v 1>Try to evaporate it down in the V part, the very bottom,</v>

99
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.480
because the customers usually dissolve this up in

100
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.860
about 100 or 200 microliters of solution,

101
00:06:35.861 --> 00:06:38.110
which is about two to three drops.

102
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.960
<v 0>They evaporated and you'd get the bottle.</v>

103
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.220
And right at the bottom is a tiny bit of actinium. So the question is,

104
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.470
how do they know if they've got a new there?

105
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.650
And they have an extraordinarily cunning piece of kit,

106
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.170
which they call the gamma Ray camera,

107
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.910
which measures some of the gamma rays that are given out

108
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.820
by the actinium when it decays.

109
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.690
<v 1>Gotcha.</v>

110
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.780
<v 0>Right? It's like light beam or photon of light,</v>

111
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.800
but very short wavelengths. So we'll go through a lot of materials,

112
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.970
including through the shielding, the front of the box.

113
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.830
Another way you can see the element is that as it decays,

114
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.160
it actually gives out a glow of blue light.

115
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.700
The glow is pretty weak. So if you want to photograph it,

116
00:07:30.701 --> 00:07:34.540
you have to switch out all the lights and do a long exposure.

117
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:42.100
<v 1>Uh, they're bagging out the dry side. Um, actinium two 25.</v>

118
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.460
So we took it to complete dryness in those glass vials.

119
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.300
So she'll work it all the way down to the bottom of the bag.

120
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.200
And then there'll run a heat seal across there.

121
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.830
The plastic is melted there into a band

122
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:07.720
[inaudible].

123
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.410
<v 0>I should say they sell the bottle for a thousand dollars.</v>

124
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:12.880
Just wait a moment.

125
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:17.740
A thousand dollars for 1000th of a microgram

126
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:23.380
means that you would have to pay a thousand million

127
00:08:23.381 --> 00:08:27.100
dollars for a gram of this material. Of course,

128
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.990
you couldn't make a gram of this material and it would be so radioactive

129
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:33.610
that nobody could handle it,

130
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:38.740
but that just gives you an idea of the sort of price of this

131
00:08:38.741 --> 00:08:39.574
material.

132
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:43.750
<v 1>Use it to make medications. And so the medicine, this is actually,</v>

133
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:48.520
they tell me is one of the less expensive ingredients necessarily in the

134
00:08:48.521 --> 00:08:51.070
final medicine. Once they get it made,

135
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.220
we're very motivated by the fact the application.

136
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:59.190
Everybody knows somebody who's had cancer or some family member that has cancer

137
00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:00.120
and is dealing with that.

138
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.580
So we're very excited to be able to work with something that we know

139
00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:07.800
gets immediate application. You know,

140
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:12.240
a lot of the research that we do down the road, it might develop into something,

141
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.490
but ours,

142
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.820
it goes out weekly for patients to be treated.

143
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.360
So it's very nice being that closely connected with them.

144
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:31.790
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>
