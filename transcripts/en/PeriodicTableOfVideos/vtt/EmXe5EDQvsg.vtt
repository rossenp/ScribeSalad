1
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.090
<v 1>You're going to let me touch it with my hands.</v>

2
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.730
Watch carefully only time in my life.

3
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.060
I'm going to wash my hands in diamonds.

4
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.680
We're now in the chief experts department and they have brought out some really

5
00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:26.420
special diamonds for us, brought them out from a vault somewhere.

6
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.760
And I'm amazed by them.

7
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.590
This one here is the biggest diamond that is here.

8
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.040
It is 240 carrots,

9
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.330
but it's rather a shapeless lump. But down here,

10
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.900
there are some really amazing shapes.

11
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.030
I never realized that a diamond when it's not even

12
00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:54.020
cut is a almost perfect octahedron.

13
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.050
It looks like out of the textbooks.

14
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.730
I just can't believe that nature can make a nothing quite so beautiful.

15
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.170
If you look down here, you can see this one. Here is the big yellow,

16
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.810
I think because of an impurity.

17
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.200
And then you can get some quite strong colors.

18
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.060
This one here is purple and this one is pink.

19
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.820
These ones here have grown into an almost perfect

20
00:01:22.821 --> 00:01:26.720
cube. And this little one is really,

21
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.420
as far as I can see a perfect cube.

22
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.350
And then there's one that looks like a football.

23
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.630
Very important world cup was here in Russia last year though.

24
00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:40.400
I don't play football myself.

25
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.910
And then there's another one that looks like a skull.

26
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.010
And if you turn it over it's hollow,

27
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.810
I think because it dissolved during the geological D

28
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.360
position may be in very high temperature, high pressure water that it dissolved,

29
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.890
but it's got a rather strange bowl shape with eyes

30
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.800
might be a bit grim having a dam and shaped like a scowl on your ring.

31
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.530
These ones here,

32
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.690
I think perhaps are the chemically the most interesting they're black

33
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.910
because they're a combination of diamond. And also graphite.

34
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.470
We have a box with 1,490

35
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.960
crystals of diamonds.

36
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.520
It's very interesting to me that they can actually count them so carefully.

37
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.140
You can see even these tiny crystals are all

38
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.590
octahedral. And if you look under the microscope,

39
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.470
you can see these little Octa Hydra.

40
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.490
I looked in the microscope, not very good in microscopes with my glasses,

41
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.240
but even I could see that they were really nice and crystalline.

42
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.480
This one here is the so-called twin,

43
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.910
where to optimize Kindra have grown simultaneously in

44
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:13.210
different directions. So you get a less interesting shape.

45
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.590
And at the same time, I was fascinated that in this one,

46
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.250
there's a crack diamond, such a strong material,

47
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.500
but even so sometimes it can crack.

48
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.320
And then down here is a,

49
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.730
an interesting crystal tiny,

50
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.620
but it has three twins. The two grown simultaneously.

51
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.150
So you have six octahedral all close together.

52
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.420
These are the different qualities of the diamonds.

53
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.760
Sometimes clearer, nicer shaped crystals than others. And again,

54
00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:53.080
they have standards to make sure that they classify all of them

55
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:57.670
correctly because once you go to big box of them, if you've made a mistake,

56
00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.680
you have to sort them all over again.

57
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.450
These diamonds are not completely pure company.

58
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.220
They contain traces of nitrogen. You can't see this with the eye,

59
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.480
but you can see it by using a UV light.

60
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.310
So Natalia,

61
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.320
we'll just put the biggest diamonds onto UV lamp and you

62
00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:25.210
can see suddenly it gives out blue light and you can tell

63
00:04:25.211 --> 00:04:29.380
that different diamonds, fluoresce, different amounts,

64
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.570
and occasionally you can get a different type of nitrogen

65
00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:38.680
center, which instead of being blue is yellow.

66
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.390
So Natalie we'll show you one. Now one of the cubic ones,

67
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.220
and you can see it's a greenish yellow color. Again,

68
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.230
this is a really nice demonstration of spectroscopy and you could

69
00:04:53.231 --> 00:04:54.520
analyze it even better,

70
00:04:54.521 --> 00:04:59.050
looking through a spectrometer to get the precise wavelengths of the emissions.

71
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.660
So here you can see there's a nice blue, glowing octahedron.

72
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.450
Can we try the pink diamond?

73
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.930
You can see that one doesn't fluoresce at all.

74
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.620
So it probably doesn't have any nitrogen sensors in it,

75
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.100
or at least none that will absorb. But again,

76
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.870
this is a nice way of categorizing the different diamonds

77
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.640
so that you learn more about their structure. Learn more about that chemistry.

78
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.800
Let's try the pink diamond as well.

79
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.880
I think that's really interesting. The pink diamond fluoresces blue,

80
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.040
but you wouldn't have guessed that.

81
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.370
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

82
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.860
<v 1>I'm in the sorting department where the raw diamonds have</v>

83
00:05:57.861 --> 00:06:00.530
graded. It's really amazing.

84
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.210
The diamonds that come here look rather like sand.

85
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.410
If you look here this bowl, I can just pull some out.

86
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.790
But what's amazing is that people go through this

87
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.190
literally grain by grain.

88
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.860
They have about 8,000 different grades,

89
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.810
which they know they remember, and they classify each of the grains,

90
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.370
according to the grade.

91
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.540
And here we have about 26 or

92
00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:36.860
27,000 carrots in weight of diamonds.

93
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.390
The total value of this doesn't look very much is more than the million

94
00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:42.230
dollars.

95
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.430
That's why people are watching me carefully and wearing a special coat,

96
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.780
no pockets.

97
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.670
And even these tiny grains look like little octahedral,

98
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.170
tiny crystals.

99
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.060
And you've got to remember that these grains have been obtained from a

100
00:06:59.061 --> 00:07:03.290
solid mass of rock, which has been ground up and out of the rock.

101
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.230
They filter off these special diamonds.

102
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.830
And what's interesting here is that you can see different colors.

103
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.900
Some of the grains look a bit yellow,

104
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.870
some look really clear one or two gray.

105
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.790
So it's like my hair, perhaps my hair should be graded in color.

106
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:25.120
<v 0>Okay.</v>

107
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.800
<v 1>Particularly interesting for me is that all of this is sorted by hand</v>

108
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:34.900
because they are so valuable that it's worth people looking at each one

109
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:35.830
individually.

110
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.540
That's why every diamond should be to you really special.

111
00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:58.690
<v 0>It's amazing.</v>

112
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.950
<v 1>I've never seen anything like this.</v>

113
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.240
<v 0>It's unbelievable.</v>

114
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:31.330
<v 1>They're going to let me touch it with my hands. Watch carefully.</v>

115
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:36.070
Only time in my life. I'm going to wash my hands in diamonds

116
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.550
Feels just like sand. It's quite strange.

117
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.470
It feels a bit like metal because diamond conducts heat very

118
00:08:47.471 --> 00:08:50.890
well. So it feels as if I'm holding metal.

119
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:56.070
I think I could do this for quite a long time if they let me, but.

120
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.903
<v 0>Still.</v>

121
00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:02.870
<v 1>Here, you've got a million dollars worth of diamonds,</v>

122
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.330
literally running through my fingers. Some of them are sticking to my hand.

123
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.990
We'll make sure you get them off. No [inaudible]

124
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:14.750
yes.

125
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:15.583
<v 0>Thank you.</v>

126
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.550
<v 1>I think this is the most extraordinary thing I've ever done on periodic videos</v>

127
00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:31.280
and certainly the most fun,

128
00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.690
the gold it's an exciting element.

129
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.680
It has interesting chemistry and it's just sitting here doing nothing.

130
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:43.130
It's enormously impressive, but it's a bit sad,

131
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.750
rather like a mausoleum.
