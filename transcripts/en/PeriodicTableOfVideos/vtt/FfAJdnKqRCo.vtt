00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.390
<v 0>I want to tell you about some research that my colleague, Mike,</v>

2
00:00:03.391 --> 00:00:07.980
George and I have done on the anti-malarial drug called

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:08.910
artemisinin.

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.490
Malaria is a truly dreadful disease that kills huge

5
00:00:14.491 --> 00:00:17.040
numbers of people right across the planet.

6
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.620
And artemisinin is one of the most effective drugs at the moment

7
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.730
against malaria.

8
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.900
And we've had funding from the bill and Melinda Gates foundation,

9
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.030
and also from industry to try and make the process

10
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.160
for getting this drug more efficient and greener using

11
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.810
less toxic chemicals.

12
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.340
Malaria is a disease which is spread by mosquitoes.

13
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.210
If you're bitten by mosquitoes, carrying the plasmodium, parasite,

14
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.160
it injects this into your bloodstream. The parasite goes into your liver,

15
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.840
it multiplies,

16
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.940
and then bursts out of your liver and inhabits the red blood

17
00:00:59.941 --> 00:01:00.774
cells,

18
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.670
where it destroys the hemoglobin stopping the courage of

19
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.620
oxygen around your body,

20
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.480
and eventually causing the red blood cells to effectively blow up.

21
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.670
And the debris can clog.

22
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.240
The Capella is and cause a really unpleasant death.

23
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.130
What is needed are low cost drugs that can treat people who are

24
00:01:23.131 --> 00:01:24.000
infected.

25
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.140
And what you need to do is to zap these

26
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.770
parasites. You can also kill the mosquitoes,

27
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.170
but once you're infected it,

28
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:38.040
doesn't really much about the mosquitoes except they could spread the disease to

29
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:42.000
someone else or to missing or summits derivatives.

30
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.410
And here I've got a molecule or model about missing our

31
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.760
molecules that contain a bond with two oxygen atoms.

32
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.320
These oxygen atoms can be released in the form of hydrogen

33
00:01:55.321 --> 00:01:59.670
peroxide, which I believe then kills the parasites.

34
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.920
Artemisinin is called artemisinin because it's extracted from the plant

35
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.750
called to mission and annual, which grows in tropical places.

36
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:10.950
For example, in Vietnam,

37
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.930
nobody's absolutely clear why the plant makes this material and they totally

38
00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:20.070
make small amounts. So you need a lot of plants to extract the material out.

39
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.780
And at the moment,

40
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.240
the amount of material that can be made from plants is

41
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.910
sometimes just enough or if it is a bad crop, not enough.

42
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.160
So what is needed is a way of making this molecule efficiently

43
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.653
chemically.

44
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.120
Now you can see it's a pretty complicated molecule making this from scratch.

45
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.470
Although various skilled organic chemists have done it is

46
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.130
too expensive. There are too many steps needed.

47
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.990
So there has been some very elegant work done on modifying

48
00:02:57.991 --> 00:02:58.800
yeast.

49
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.610
So the yeast can react with glucose or eat

50
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:08.020
glucose and turn it into a molecule which with some

51
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.920
chemical processes can be turned into artemisinin.

52
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.720
The two key steps that we've been looking at are the addition of these two

53
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:21.250
oxygen atoms so-called peroxide linkage here,

54
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.470
which is made by reacting the molecules

55
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.330
with oxygen in a special form called singlet oxygen.

56
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.690
If you've watched our video on oxygen,

57
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.610
you will know that normally oxygen has unpaired electrons and is

58
00:03:38.611 --> 00:03:41.190
paramagnetic, it's attracted to maintenance,

59
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.050
but if you have oxygen in solution in the presence of sun

60
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.250
eyes, colored compounds, if you sign visible light,

61
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.270
these dyes can transfer the energy of the light.

62
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.420
They absorb to the oxygen and pair up the electrons,

63
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.530
but not for very long because the electrons quite quickly unpair.

64
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.620
So what you've got to do is to get this oxygen,

65
00:04:04.621 --> 00:04:09.420
to react with your molecules before the electrons can unpair again.

66
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.370
Now the pharmaceutical companies developed a really neat

67
00:04:14.371 --> 00:04:19.110
process in which they can make up to 60 tons a year of this compound.

68
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.070
The problem is that the process works really well,

69
00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.960
but is still quite expensive.

70
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.370
And so we've been collaborating with them to do fundamental research,

71
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.550
to see if there are ways that we can make the process cheaper.

72
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.890
And we've had some really quite good success and we've come up with two

73
00:04:37.891 --> 00:04:41.160
different ways and I'm not going to go into all the details,

74
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.750
but let me just give you a flavor.

75
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.620
The first thing is that when you're reacting oxygen,

76
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.680
which can make things burn,

77
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.250
you have to be very careful in your choice of solvent.

78
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.110
So we've done some experiments where we use as the solvent liquid

79
00:04:58.111 --> 00:05:02.850
CO2 CO2 can't burn. So that makes it safer.

80
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.410
And we have quite a clever way, which you can read about in our paper,

81
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.630
in which we can make the dye molecules stick to solid

82
00:05:12.631 --> 00:05:16.680
acid, because you also need an acid to catalyze the reaction.

83
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.250
So you can have a small tube with everything in it that you need,

84
00:05:20.251 --> 00:05:21.540
your sign lights on it.

85
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.610
The precursor goes in and out of the bottom comes optimism.

86
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.350
The second experiments or set of experience we did really by

87
00:05:31.351 --> 00:05:36.000
chance was to discover that we could make our [inaudible]

88
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.350
and the mixture of ethanol that's Ethal, alcohol and water.

89
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.980
Now you may think that's not very surprising,

90
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.530
but there is a strong feeling among chemists

91
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.600
that you can't do reactions of these singlet oxygen with paired

92
00:05:54.601 --> 00:05:56.280
electrons in water,

93
00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.710
because is really good at making the electrons unpaired again.

94
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.780
But it just turns out that the

95
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.330
water has other properties,

96
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.170
which pushed the molecules together and make them react faster.

97
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.010
But once you're working in water and ethanol,

98
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.490
you can then use less toxic acids. For example,

99
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.530
dilute sulfuric acid.

100
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.410
And the real beauty of the experiment is that we discovered that at

101
00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:31.730
the end, if you evaporate of some of the ethanol,

102
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.920
the pure product precipitates out, and you can just filter off the crystals.

103
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.140
Normally you need to use a lot more solvents to purify the product once you've

104
00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:44.420
made it and everything else,

105
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.600
the ethanol live distilled off the remaining water,

106
00:06:47.601 --> 00:06:51.230
the acid and everything else can be recycled round and round.

107
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.000
The other possibility is that now we are beginning to understand the chemistry.

108
00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.800
We could make other derivatives of ultimate listening already.

109
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.690
Some of the malarial parasites are becoming resistant to artemisinin.

110
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.410
And so if we can make new derivatives of it,

111
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.590
we may be able to zap the parasites even better.

112
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:17.900
The thing that really excites me is that especially

113
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:18.230
the,

114
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:23.180
to water is very simple and the product is so

115
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:28.190
pure that we actually took one crystal and went straight from the lab to

116
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.380
our crystallography lab. That's next door.

117
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.130
And they produce the crystal structure in an hour and a half.

118
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:39.200
And normally it takes time to grow crystals and get them ready and so

119
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:40.970
on. And here we did it really quickly.

120
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.770
The other thing is that I failed my exams,

121
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.160
my final exams as a students in organic chemistry.

122
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.580
And it was my colleague, Mike George,

123
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:56.900
who persuaded me that our group could actually do something useful for

124
00:07:56.901 --> 00:08:01.180
malaria. And I'm really grateful to him and he's made it happen.

125
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.570
And if I take the liquid oxygen, you can say,

126
00:08:05.571 --> 00:08:09.280
I can pull it right up here because oops,

127
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.970
it's not as magnetic as my keys,

128
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.960
but you can see there's a really big difference. It sticks to the magnet

129
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.010
so you can see it really is magnetic.
