1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.700
<v 0>We have something extraordinary for you today.</v>

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.620
Probably the oldest periodic table that exists,

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.830
that was made to hang in a lecture theater.

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.840
I've got a picture of it on my table. And Brady has actually been to see it.

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.090
It's being repaired at the moment and he's watched how it is being treated

6
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.830
and the chemistry behind it. Yeah.

7
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.530
<v 1>As a paper, conservator must have looked at this and thought this is a big deal.</v>

8
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:28.663
But.

9
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.990
<v 0>Most of you know,</v>

10
00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:34.760
that lecture theaters classrooms all over the world have periodic

11
00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:36.020
tables hanging in them.

12
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.730
Clearly when Mandalay invented the periodic table,

13
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.270
nobody had one in their labs or lecture theaters,

14
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.690
and sometime people must've started hanging them up.

15
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.100
The periodic table that I'm talking about was found

16
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.090
under a lecture theater in the storeroom, the university of St.

17
00:00:56.091 --> 00:00:57.410
Andrews in Scotland,

18
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.850
the new head of department was ordered to clear out this old store room,

19
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.010
probably for fire safety or something like that. And among the objects,

20
00:01:07.011 --> 00:01:11.210
they found a rolled up periodic table. And here it is.

21
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.830
And if you look at it, there are many things a bit surprising. So first of all,

22
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:16.880
it's in German.

23
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.530
That's not totally surprising because in the 19th century,

24
00:01:21.531 --> 00:01:25.070
Germany was the leading country for chemistry.

25
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.370
Mandalay wrote his papers in German quite often.

26
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.470
The second thing is that men delay is spelled in what looks like a really

27
00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:35.840
strange way to us. Again,

28
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.160
every language has a different way of translating or

29
00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:44.660
transliterating Russian letters. And so in German,

30
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.340
this is what mental life looks like. Actually, it's not German.

31
00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:53.300
This periodic table, it was Austrian. It was made in Vienna.

32
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.180
And the key question is what is the date?

33
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.090
It has to be after 1869,

34
00:01:59.091 --> 00:02:03.080
because that's when Mandalay first proposed the periodic table.

35
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.630
And then this form that's on the picture.

36
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.690
He only proposed in 1871,

37
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.490
but we can date it rather like you can take periodic tables now by

38
00:02:13.491 --> 00:02:17.360
looking at the names of the recent elements that are on it.

39
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.980
There is gallium,

40
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.910
which was one of the elements predicted by mental lave,

41
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.880
which was discovered in 1875.

42
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.550
So it must be later than 1875.

43
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.310
And then there is also scandium,

44
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.100
which was discovered in 1879,

45
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.330
but there is a whole element atomic weight, 72,

46
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.860
which is germanium. And since this is in a German language,

47
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.540
it's almost inconceivable that the people would not print it

48
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.540
germanium the element named after Germany,

49
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.490
if it had been discovered to Manian was discovered in 1886.

50
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.800
So we have a bracket it's somewhere between 1870 and

51
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:01.900
1886. I don't know.

52
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.730
I find 1880 for no particular reason except seems

53
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:10.690
about right then there's some other quite interesting features.

54
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.910
First of all, there's a slightly strange element down here, DEI,

55
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.680
which is, must be one of the railroad and the elements,

56
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.810
lanthanum and serum are the other way round from what they are now,

57
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.030
because they have rather similar atomic weights and the

58
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.380
elements were arranged by atomic weight and mentally I've got that wrong.

59
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.790
The other question,

60
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.320
which I think is really very interesting is of course in

61
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.610
1880, people did not know about electrons,

62
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.660
so they did not know, but atomic number.

63
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.150
So how did they justify to the audience looking at on the

64
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:59.470
wall? How did they justify the order of the elements?

65
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.320
And if you look here, there is a first row,

66
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.030
which explains the mechanism of they or the way they rationalized it

67
00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:07.870
explained it.

68
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.580
And they used it on the basis of the formula of the oxides,

69
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.160
beginning with our turbo,

70
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.590
quite strange that they sort of use the letter R for a metal and going all the

71
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:24.940
way across here to this end group eight, which is R O fall.

72
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.650
You notice that they've got the numbers superscript rather than subscript that

73
00:04:29.651 --> 00:04:32.560
we have. Now we would never have the full, further down.

74
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.060
And they also have for some of these elements like comp and they have the

75
00:04:37.061 --> 00:04:40.930
formula of the hydride. So here you've got RH for like

76
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.900
[inaudible] and so on. So there was a sort of rationalization for the elements.

77
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.910
I think gold is on there twice professor.

78
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.050
So let's see in the bottom left corner and the bottom right corner. Oh,

79
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.790
I hadn't noticed that. Well,

80
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.530
gold is twice as good as any other elements that shows that they weren't quite

81
00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:03.040
sure where some of these elements went. Brady was really lucky.

82
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.930
I'm quite jealous.

83
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.180
He went to see the conservator who was restoring this periodic table

84
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:11.950
to as good as state as possible.

85
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.810
The conservator talked about how they were trying to increase the pH by quite a

86
00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:18.580
clever piece of chemistry,

87
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.650
reacting magnesium by compensate with the

88
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.020
acid oddity in the paper itself.

89
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.750
<v 2>So this treatment now has got to that stage where it has been washed.</v>

90
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.400
And it's also been de acidified that was done by immersion in a

91
00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:40.200
dilute solution of magnesium by carbonate or magnesium, hydrogen carbonate.

92
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.730
Look at you using your periodic table. Here we are. It's here in black, black,

93
00:05:44.731 --> 00:05:45.564
and white.

94
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.070
<v 0>I wouldn't find one like this in the university of Nottingham because university</v>

95
00:05:50.071 --> 00:05:54.030
of Nottingham only started as a university in

96
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.560
1881.

97
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.300
And I don't think chemistry till several years later,

98
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.390
but I think it's important to remember that periodic tables were not very common

99
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:06.740
for quite a long time.

100
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.580
Even my first chemistry book on inorganic chemistry,

101
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.000
didn't have a periodic table in it. When I was at high school,

102
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.770
the lab had a nice one,

103
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.530
but I think I'm really pleased that the sharp eyes of the chemists

104
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.960
at St Andrew's made so that this was preserved and the tea will

105
00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:28.820
be kept for posterity.

106
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.510
The way I understand the university archives in St.

107
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.450
Andrews are taking it for safe keeping.

108
00:06:35.451 --> 00:06:40.070
So it wouldn't be hanging in the chemistry department, which is a pity,

109
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.330
but you have to look after these artifacts in a proper way.

110
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.930
<v 3>Now, just as a little bonus,</v>

111
00:06:49.931 --> 00:06:54.010
we've got another chat that Richard's been conserving also for the university of

112
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.160
St. Andrews. Do you think he might show us that one? Absolutely. Look at this.

113
00:06:57.161 --> 00:07:00.550
Let's see how quickly people can figure out what this is as it gets unrolled.
