00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.990
<v 0>Element 85 is asked the team,</v>

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.820
ask the 10 filled in the space at the bottom of the halogens. No,

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.800
of course it's not at the bottom of the halogens now because very recently,

4
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.320
Tennessee in went below it.

5
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.990
<v 1>I'm not sure the time we'll try and get all the time.</v>

6
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.670
<v 0>But at the time it was discovered it was the heaviest</v>

7
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.810
halogen that is in the group that begins with fluorine.

8
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.610
And it goes down chlorine bromine ID ask the team

9
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.530
as the team was known to be or expected to be

10
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.690
really radioactive.

11
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.190
Now they knew there was an element should be there for two reasons.

12
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.520
First of all, because if you looked at the periodic table,

13
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.270
they appear to be a hole, but that's not terribly scientific,

14
00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.160
but using the experiments that would have been done in the early

15
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.760
20th century by a physicist called Henry Mosley,

16
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.950
they knew that by the x-ray emissions of the different elements,

17
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.540
there ought to be an element between polonium and

18
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.790
radon searches for astatine and nature failed.

19
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.990
There was no obvious traces of this missing radioactive elements.

20
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.520
So in the end,

21
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.830
it was decided that it should be synthesized by taking

22
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.060
this Smith,

23
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.950
which is element 83 and bombarding it

24
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.720
with alpha particles.

25
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.580
Alpha particles are nuclei of helium was element

26
00:01:43.581 --> 00:01:45.650
number 2 83,

27
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.590
plus two makes 85.

28
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.870
So you imagine the accelerated alpha particles

29
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.940
hitting the nuclei of the bismuth and eventually one of them

30
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.710
will fuse and you will get an atom of astatine. Now,

31
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.760
this is similar to the more modern approach,

32
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.310
which has been used for the super heavy elements,

33
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.790
but as the teen is much more stable than those.

34
00:02:13.791 --> 00:02:17.750
So once you made an atom, it didn't decay immediately.

35
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.530
So you could build up modest quantities of Asotin,

36
00:02:21.531 --> 00:02:26.480
but not nearly enough to actually see any of the

37
00:02:26.481 --> 00:02:31.280
solid material after ask the team had been discovered or

38
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.330
synthesized.

39
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.740
It was then discovered in traces amounts in minerals.

40
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:37.491
Once you know,

41
00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:41.990
the emissions signature of the radioactive particles coming out from its

42
00:02:41.991 --> 00:02:46.040
decay, you can detect that emission elsewhere.

43
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.560
And it's been calculated that if you took all the us 13,

44
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.310
that exists in the whole world at any one time,

45
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.120
it would weigh less than these three.

46
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.890
So that's less than 30 grams,

47
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:05.620
less than an ounce in the whole world.

48
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.310
And none of it is in lumps.

49
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.770
There's the old atom hero there, which decays quite rapidly for me.

50
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.600
One of the most interesting questions is whether as the

51
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:23.680
teen behaves like other halogens,

52
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.660
if you go down the group,

53
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.410
you would expect because fluorine and chlorine Agassiz,

54
00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.990
bromine is a liquid IDN is a solid.

55
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.910
You would expect that as the teen would be a solid though, like France emits,

56
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.970
radioactivity might blow the solid apart.

57
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.670
But the other point about us,

58
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:47.380
the teen is that as you go down these

59
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.340
elements,

60
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.840
they gradually become more and more like a metal.

61
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.270
So I Dean is strongly colored and sometimes

62
00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:01.600
forms positive ions, as well as negative ions.

63
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.700
As the teen could have some metallic characters and in

64
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:07.563
chemistry,

65
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.550
it sometimes seems to resemble polonium the element next

66
00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:14.320
to it, element number 84,

67
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.180
more than it does resemble IRD in the elements above perhaps the

68
00:04:19.181 --> 00:04:20.530
most interesting fact,

69
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.240
which I think is quite fun is that for all the other

70
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.470
halogens, if you form the compound with hydrogen,

71
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.320
hydrogen chloride, hydrogen iodide,

72
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.050
the halogen is negative with respect to the hydrogen and you get an

73
00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:42.100
acid. And it has been argued that with us, the teen,

74
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.290
it may be the other way round.

75
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.520
It may be astatine hydride rather than

76
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.160
hydrogen as the tide.

77
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.320
They reasoned that it was called astatine is because it comes

78
00:04:56.321 --> 00:04:58.360
from the Greek word [inaudible]

79
00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.360
, which means unstable. I think the pronunciation is right. I asked one of my Greek colleagues at coffee today. And in fact, in Greek, it is still called us the term. It is means unstable in the sense that the weather is changeable or something like that. So it's quite good because I think if you think about it, chemically, first of all, it means it's unstable it decays, but it also means perhaps it's unstable. It's not quite sure whether it's a metal or a halogen. Well, before I started making these videos, I thought all these elements were very boring 

80
00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.360
and never really thought about them. What I now discover

81
00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.360
 is that each of these elements, when you start delving into it is actually quite an interesting story. And particularly they're interesting stories of human ambition and greed among the people who want to claim to 

82
00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.360
discover that

83
00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.360
. And there are whole series of people, one unsuccessful claimant wanted to call it Alabamian after Alabama, presumably his home state. So it's quite fun that the element that is now underneath it 

84
00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.360
elements

85
00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.360
 117 is called Tennessee in. So in the end, an American state got recognition though, sadly for 

86
00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.193
that chemist, it wasn't Alabama.

87
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.460
And not only testing, who'd be quite exciting in its own. Right. And so.

88
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.820
<v 2>We're really interested. He's not a very good actor. Is it so happy?</v>

89
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.740
Sorry, go ahead.
