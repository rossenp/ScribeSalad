00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.330
<v 0>Nitrogen is an extraordinarily important element.</v>

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.340
We could make hundreds of YouTube videos about nitrogen and still not tell you

3
00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:12.690
everything. So Neil and I and Brady have been in the lab.

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.900
We've done what we think is some quite nice experiments.

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.170
Just to give you a flavor of some of the things about nitrogen.

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.440
So you will see me trying to smash a banana.

7
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.420
You'll see Brown is being generated sodium.

8
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.500
Isaid going off in quite a spectacular manner and one or two other things.

9
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.300
So it's really fun, but there is some quite solid chemistry behind it.

10
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.790
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

11
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.020
<v 0>Liquid nitrogen,</v>

12
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.920
which boils at minus 196 degrees.

13
00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:56.600
Centigrade is used as a coolant all over the world in

14
00:00:56.601 --> 00:00:59.270
laboratories and industrially.

15
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.810
When nitrogen comes out of the container,

16
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.830
it's obviously cold and you can see in the thermal imaging,

17
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.790
how the low temperature cools everything around it,

18
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.810
it also freezes the water vapor in the atmosphere.

19
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.880
So you get quite nice clouds of what looked like steam,

20
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.820
but it's actually tiny particles of ice.

21
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.483
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

22
00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.400
<v 0>I used to use it.</v>

23
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.420
My shoes cracked through freezing and liquid nitrogen.

24
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.600
I never tried freezing a banana.

25
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.690
I wanted to see the professor trying to smash a banana.

26
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.060
When you pull things in liquid nitrogen fruit, for example, that contains water,

27
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.800
the water freezes. So the banana goes absolutely rigid.

28
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.020
And then if you hit it with a hammer or something else, the ice shatters,

29
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.470
and it can make quite a spectacular mess.

30
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.250
The salt meal hates chemists use liquid nitrogen. First of all,

31
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.490
because it's safe, liquid oxygen would cause,

32
00:02:49.491 --> 00:02:52.520
or potentially it could cause fires explosions.

33
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.230
You've seen liquid oxygen and cotton wool going watch also easy to

34
00:02:57.231 --> 00:03:01.630
obtain. It's a major component of air is quite cheap to make.

35
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.760
Also it has a convenient temperature of 77 degrees,

36
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:10.240
Kelvin minus 196 degrees centigrade,

37
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.560
which is a useful temperature, which freezes most things,

38
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:15.850
most gases,

39
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.560
most things that you use in the land sodium azide is

40
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.100
assault of sodium and a plus. And the ACE side,

41
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.900
I N N three minus eight side comes from the French

42
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:33.280
name for nitrogen assault in three minors is

43
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.870
potentially a very unstable an iron. If you heat it,

44
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.940
it can turn to nitrogen gas.

45
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.680
And two has a very strong bond between the two nitrogen atoms.

46
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.240
So it releases a lot of energy. So we tried heating surgery,

47
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.420
may side. The reaction is quite simple.

48
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:55.420
It goes to nitrogen gas and sodium vapor.

49
00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.520
The sodium immediately reacts with oxygen and water vapor in the atmosphere.

50
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.660
So you get a orange colored flame from the

51
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.370
reaction of sodium.

52
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.883
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

53
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.710
<v 0>Sodium azide is one of the components that's used in airbags in</v>

54
00:04:28.711 --> 00:04:32.490
cars, the car, if it's crushing heats,

55
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.080
a charge of safety may side, which is also mixed with some other chemicals,

56
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.060
it releases nitrogen gas very quickly and blows up the air.

57
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.760
<v 2>Back.</v>

58
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.560
One safety advice that looks likely to be compulsory soon is the controversial

59
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.730
air bag. This drawing shows how it works in a crash.

60
00:04:50.731 --> 00:04:55.320
A small detonator releases compressed nitrogen from a tube and this

61
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.500
inflates, the bags concealed in the dash and the steering column.

62
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.500
<v 0>But I've never seen it heated up. Neither Neil actually,</v>

63
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.290
it's really quite beautiful when you heat it up.

64
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.390
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

65
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.090
<v 0>Other resides particularly have heavy metals like lead silver notary</v>

66
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.340
sometimes used in detonators to set off explosives because if you bang

67
00:05:29.341 --> 00:05:32.040
them, they compose very rapidly.

68
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.160
Although nitrogen is very unreactive.

69
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.290
It can be persuaded to react with oxygen and it forms a whole

70
00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:45.180
series of different oxides compounds that contain nitrogen and

71
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.920
oxygen and their properties are very different.

72
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.260
The most stable one is called nitrous oxide sometimes called

73
00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.680
laughing gas and two O N two O has the property that it

74
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.050
dissolves very easily. In fact,

75
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.450
your brain and mine is largely fat and so into

76
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:11.150
a dissolves well in the brain.

77
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.200
And it's very good anesthetic it's used in childbirth,

78
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.420
but because it dissolves well in fat.

79
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.900
It's also used as a propellant for instance,

80
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.630
Brady and I,

81
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.860
and Neil has quite a lot of fun squirting out instant cream,

82
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.710
just to show you the nitrous oxide in it.

83
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.500
The cream is pressurized within two hours,

84
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.300
probably in to not a very high pressure atmosphere or a few atmospheres when you

85
00:06:40.301 --> 00:06:43.930
release it, the dissolved into a bubbles out.

86
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.640
So the liquid creams suddenly goes into a foam ready to go on

87
00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:51.700
your cake. Some of the cream, when I eat the cream,

88
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:56.340
there's probably some mentor left in the cream, but if you wanted to knit,

89
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.260
it ties yourself by eating cream,

90
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:04.150
you would farm it long before you had enough to have any serious effect.

91
00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.400
The other two oxides of nitrogen,

92
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.970
R N O nitric oxide,

93
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.210
and [inaudible] nitrogen dioxide.

94
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.980
They're both quite unusual because nitrogen has seven

95
00:07:17.981 --> 00:07:21.130
electrons and oxygen has six.

96
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.340
So both compounds have unpaired electrons,

97
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.130
which gives them slightly unusual properties.

98
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.100
It's quite easy to make an a to the standard way is

99
00:07:33.101 --> 00:07:35.350
just to heat up. Let nitrates

100
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:44.080
Late night trade is late two plus three minus.

101
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.680
And when you heat it up, you form lead oxide,

102
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.130
which is a sort of slightly yellow orange color.

103
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:55.180
And you make enter two, which is a Brown gas.

104
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.190
And when we heated it up,

105
00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:01.060
we got really quite a sort of substantial plume of energy, too.

106
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:06.490
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

107
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.380
<v 0>And the to itself can,</v>

108
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:12.280
because it has an unpaired electron can dimerize. Um,

109
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.100
two of them form N two O four,

110
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:18.550
and which is a liquid at room temperature.

111
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:23.680
And we've shown on one of our other videos can be used as an oxidizer for

112
00:08:23.681 --> 00:08:25.240
rockets. For example,

113
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.340
the lunar module taking off from the moon used enter four

114
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:31.203
as the primary.

115
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.350
<v 1>No, it's very volatile.</v>

116
00:08:32.351 --> 00:08:36.010
It boils at 21 degrees C so we have to keep it cold and we put it into the

117
00:08:36.011 --> 00:08:36.844
reaction chamber.

118
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:42.070
<v 0>There's another way of making enter too,</v>

119
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:45.910
which is the reaction of concentrated nitric acid.

120
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:49.930
It's important that it's concentrated with metallic copper.

121
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:56.520
And we did this in glassware so that we could collect the

122
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.170
guests to see what happened.

123
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:02.250
So we had a vessel with the acid coming in at the top,

124
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:06.000
the reaction taking place and the tube at the side,

125
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.300
going into water. So we could collect the guests.

126
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:23.690
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

127
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.000
<v 0>You can see that when the acid went in,</v>

128
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:31.250
there were clouds of Brown gas generated the end or before,

129
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.180
and it went down the tube and they was bubbling as it came out.

130
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:38.300
Now we had some quite strange effects,

131
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.730
which we hadn't anticipated.

132
00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:45.680
It's one of the exciting things about doing chemistry, demonstrations,

133
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:49.520
that sometimes, although you understand what's going on,

134
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:54.590
you see effects that surprised you. When you added a bit more acid,

135
00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.010
the end two started dissolving in the acid.

136
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.940
It was already saturated in the acid that was there.

137
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.060
And there was a momentary pressure drop,

138
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:09.170
which was enough to suck back the water into the vessel.

139
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.320
And once the water was set back the end,

140
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.450
no two went on dissolving and dissolving.

141
00:10:14.451 --> 00:10:19.340
So the whole lot filled up and the solution went nicely blue

142
00:10:19.341 --> 00:10:21.470
with the color of copper nitrate.

143
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:26.540
The interesting thing about this reaction is that if you use dilute

144
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.820
or more dilute nitric acid,

145
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.820
instead of generating an a two,

146
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.690
you generate an O nitric oxide,

147
00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.240
which is not very soluble in water.

148
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.550
So bubbles out and you can collect it in a inverted test tube,

149
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:54.170
But I know reacts very easily with the oxygen in the air to make

150
00:10:54.171 --> 00:10:55.160
energy too.

151
00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.380
So when you take the test tube of Eno out of the water air

152
00:11:00.381 --> 00:11:02.780
can get in the oxygen in the air,

153
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:07.130
reacts with the it and makes the Brown and new to gas. Now,

154
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:12.050
the relevance of all these nitrogen oxides is

155
00:11:12.051 --> 00:11:16.910
that in the high temperatures that you get, particularly in diesel engines,

156
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.950
the nitrogen in the air and the oxygen in the air can

157
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:26.750
combine to make small amounts of nitric

158
00:11:26.751 --> 00:11:30.950
oxide and to nitrogen dioxide, a mixture,

159
00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.780
which is conveniently called N O X because X is somewhere

160
00:11:35.781 --> 00:11:37.370
between one and two.

161
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:42.650
These nitrogen oxides in the air are very bad for

162
00:11:42.651 --> 00:11:45.380
the air quality. When people breathe them in,

163
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.230
it can cause all sorts of breathing problems

164
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.400
And enter to dissolves in water, make nitric acid.

165
00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:57.250
So you can get that nitric acid formed.

166
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:02.020
And so N two and [inaudible] are important.

167
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.000
Environmental pollutants.

168
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.870
Why does this only happen in diesel engines and not current diesel engines

169
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:11.410
operates at a higher temperature than petrol engines,

170
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.290
which is why they are more fuel efficient.

171
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.990
So in terms of carbon dioxide,

172
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:21.790
the emissions for diesel engines are lower than perpetual engines.
