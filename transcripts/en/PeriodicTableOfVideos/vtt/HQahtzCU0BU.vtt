00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.590
<v 0>Sometimes I think of it as a very pedestrian element.</v>

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.910
It's something that doesn't have very many applications,

3
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:13.350
so it's quite easy to overlook, but at the same time,

4
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.290
some of those applications are actually really important.

5
00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:19.740
So you have to remember that like a lot of elements in the periodic table,

6
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.660
it can be very easily overlooked,

7
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.150
but actually it's got some really fantastic uses.

8
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.510
<v 1>When I think of the element home.</v>

9
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.460
Ma'am I think of the English word huddle, which may sound a bit funny,

10
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.920
but it's because there's a simple way of remembering the names of all

11
00:00:36.921 --> 00:00:40.730
the lanthanide rare-earth elements. Let me show you,

12
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.260
it begins with lanthanum and NGOs language

13
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.310
centers,

14
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.960
praise Ned's promise of you

15
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.970
put that in small European garden tubs,

16
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.330
dinosaurs, horrible erratically. Thrumming yeah.

17
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.760
Lou Lou. So there it is.

18
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.440
Number 67 holmium which you remember through the word hobble,

19
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.010
which begins with the same letters. H Oh, I learned this.

20
00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:15.980
I think when I was at school, it's really great.

21
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.140
I can write the whole row of length night elements on the Blackboard or

22
00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:26.120
whiteboard nowadays. And the students say, wow, I'm thinking I'm a genius.

23
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.780
<v 0>M was first observed, not sort of isolated,</v>

24
00:01:29.781 --> 00:01:33.620
but observed spectroscopically by two chemists in

25
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.700
1878, one of them was called Mark Del Fontane.

26
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.610
And the other was called Jack was Louis SOA.

27
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.820
They saw this wonderful spectrum. Then they thought of that.

28
00:01:43.821 --> 00:01:45.770
This must be something new and different.

29
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.070
They obviously great PR guys because they call the element act.

30
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.290
<v 1>I don't know much about holmium except that it's named after Stockholm or the</v>

31
00:01:54.291 --> 00:01:55.880
Latin name for Stockholm.

32
00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.380
I knew also that there was a lot of arguments when the element was first

33
00:02:00.381 --> 00:02:04.070
discovered, who discovered it had, they discovered it had they not.

34
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.330
<v 0>They had actually seen it and it's, it's a clean isolated state,</v>

35
00:02:08.331 --> 00:02:13.100
but it wasn't until a year later that it was actually isolated properly for the

36
00:02:13.101 --> 00:02:14.600
first time. And of course,

37
00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:18.620
one of the issues like with many of the lanthanides is actually isolating

38
00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:23.570
holmium on its own because many of the lanthanides have a very similar size.

39
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.340
So you dig them out of the ground and minerals all jumbled up together and you

40
00:02:28.341 --> 00:02:29.600
have to separate them out.

41
00:02:29.601 --> 00:02:33.380
So you can put all the psyllium in one pile over there and all the holmium in

42
00:02:33.381 --> 00:02:36.380
one pile over there. This is quite difficult to do,

43
00:02:36.381 --> 00:02:39.290
but eventually people have figured out how to do it.

44
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.830
<v 1>The other thing I know about holmium is the low temperature.</v>

45
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.920
It exhibits very strong magnetism.

46
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.190
It's not much use at room temperature,

47
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.400
but because of the number of electrons,

48
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.250
unpaired electrons at low temperature,

49
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.090
you can get really strong magnetic effects. So a year later,

50
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.430
1879.

51
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.110
<v 0>A guy called Pierre Trudeau,</v>

52
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.360
Cleve manages to separate holmium on its own for the first

53
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:08.194
time.

54
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.700
And he decided to call it after the Latin for homier,

55
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.910
which is actually Stockholm, which is his native.

56
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.490
<v 1>The T the electrons have a whole series of different energy levels,</v>

57
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.860
depending whether they're paired or unpaired.

58
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.320
And the energy separation between these levels is not

59
00:03:28.321 --> 00:03:31.590
very great. So as you warm it up,

60
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.610
the electrons have more energies. So some of them go into a higher state,

61
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.240
if you could live right down, they all go into the lowest state,

62
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.480
which in this case happens to be the really magnetic one.

63
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.640
<v 0>So holmium has some very interesting fluorescence phenomena. Um,</v>

64
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.600
so you might be able to find some kind of application where you need something

65
00:03:51.601 --> 00:03:53.790
that for the rest is with a particular type of color.

66
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.960
One sort of spinoff from that is that it,

67
00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.400
and we're back to this, uh,

68
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.840
nature of the absorption spectrum that our two folk found many,

69
00:04:03.841 --> 00:04:04.680
many years ago,

70
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.630
that spectrum is very distinct and it almost never

71
00:04:09.631 --> 00:04:10.530
changes.

72
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:11.753
<v 2>The.</v>

73
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.190
<v 1>Strange arrangement of electrons means that if you put some in</v>

74
00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:20.730
glass, you can get quite an elaborate spectrum.

75
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.590
And we used to use [inaudible] filters to calibrate our

76
00:04:25.591 --> 00:04:26.640
spectrometers.

77
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.660
<v 0>Basically you would do a run with the holmium sample and check that the</v>

78
00:04:30.661 --> 00:04:35.100
spectrometry is calibrated properly so that when you record a real spectrum,

79
00:04:35.101 --> 00:04:37.250
you know, that the peaks are actually in the right.

80
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.600
<v 1>Place. We've searched everywhere in the lab,</v>

81
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.980
but we don't calibrate spectrometers anymore. So we can't find the filter.

82
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.820
<v 2>Well, I thought all elements had a really distinctive spectrum.</v>

83
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.850
Are you saying the elements spectrums or not really? Yeah.

84
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.171
<v 0>They can do. I mean,</v>

85
00:04:52.171 --> 00:04:55.770
the first thing is it depends what type of spectroscopy you're actually running.

86
00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.270
Cause there are many, many different types. Then the second part is,

87
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.560
um, an element on its own. We'll have a very distinctive spectrum,

88
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.780
but also most elements don't turn up in the world or not found in the

89
00:05:09.781 --> 00:05:12.690
world just as the element on their own. I mean,

90
00:05:12.691 --> 00:05:16.140
obviously gold often is which is why it's used often in jewelry,

91
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.730
but most metals in the periodic table are dug out of the ground in the form of

92
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.391
oxide.

93
00:05:21.391 --> 00:05:25.140
So you want to turn them into an interesting molecule to do something with them.

94
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.130
And usually when you're changing that environment around the metal,

95
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.950
you're changing its core electronic structure,

96
00:05:31.951 --> 00:05:34.290
which that means that spectroscopy will be different.

97
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.360
But the lanthanides generally, although there are exceptions to the rule,

98
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.260
they're not really interested in what's going on around them. And in fact,

99
00:05:43.261 --> 00:05:47.250
one thing I often teach our undergraduates is that whilst transition battles

100
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.510
change a lot,

101
00:05:48.511 --> 00:05:53.490
depending on what's immediately bonded to the metal lanthanides by and large

102
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.710
are sort of screamed away from what's going on around them.

103
00:05:57.711 --> 00:05:59.960
And so you can make a really impressive,

104
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:03.260
fancy molecule with holmium in the middle of it.

105
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.600
And you could record it's, uh, ultraviolet, visible electronic spectrum,

106
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.890
and it will look barely any different to the free iron in the gas phase.

107
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.080
Because as far as it's concerned, it's no different.

108
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.740
It's almost like the lanthanides are really antisocial and they don't want to

109
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:22.550
talk to molecules that bond to them. And the way the transition metals.

110
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.710
<v 1>It is used in surgical lasers,</v>

111
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.360
where you dope a small amount of Hooten yum into so-called YAG,

112
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.130
get from aluminum Garnet.

113
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.020
And then you get laser emission around about two microns.

114
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.070
That's two millions of a meter.

115
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.630
And that wavelength is particularly good because it's strongly absorbed by

116
00:06:46.631 --> 00:06:51.010
water, which your flesh contains a lot of water.

117
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:56.050
So surgeons can cut very precisely with the laser.

118
00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.120
And apparently the laser is also so-called self cauterizing so that

119
00:07:01.121 --> 00:07:05.740
when you cut through a blood vessel, it tends to seal the blood vessel off.

120
00:07:05.741 --> 00:07:08.410
So the patient doesn't pull blood,

121
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.290
which is obviously useful.

122
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.410
<v 0>Holmium uh,</v>

123
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:16.690
is one of the elements in the periodic table that obeys the auto Hawkins rule.

124
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.850
The auto Harkins rule says that elements with even atomic

125
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.080
numbers are more prevalent than those with odd.

126
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:31.060
It just so happens that holmium is an element with an odd atomic number.

127
00:07:31.061 --> 00:07:33.550
And therefore it's less prevalent than its neighbors,

128
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.370
which have even numbers in general.

129
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.610
What you would expect is that the heavier,

130
00:07:39.611 --> 00:07:42.340
the element gets the less effect there should be.

131
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.320
But what you see is if you drew a line, it's not a nice smooth line.

132
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.720
It keeps on going up and down, up and down,

133
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.330
even though it was a line overall is decreasing.

134
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:57.340
And so what this basically shows is that the even numbered atomic nuclei

135
00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.790
are on average, more of abundance than their neighbors,

136
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.610
which doesn't sort of make sense at first.

137
00:08:03.611 --> 00:08:06.490
And so you think about how are elements actually formed.

138
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.750
Now you start off with hydrogen in the universe in suns,

139
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:16.570
that's converted in a helium and it's usually helium nuclei being pushed

140
00:08:16.571 --> 00:08:20.560
together. That help you form heavier and heavier elements.

141
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.820
But once you start with an even numbered nuclei,

142
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:29.200
then your products are always going to be even so like carbon,

143
00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.610
which is six would be three helium nuclei to get a

144
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.590
nitrogen, which is seven.

145
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.430
Then you need to add in a hydrogen from somewhere.

146
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.520
And that seems to be a little bit more difficult to do because most of the

147
00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:44.980
hydrogen had to be used to be turned into helium.

148
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.920
So once you go into a universe with helium,

149
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:53.020
you're more likely to get even numbered elements. One though,

150
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.550
that is the big outlier is still actually hydrogen.

151
00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.610
And of course that's a good job because if it hadn't,

152
00:08:59.611 --> 00:09:00.750
then you wouldn't have water,

153
00:09:00.751 --> 00:09:04.140
which is essential for life and you wouldn't have most of the molecules in the

154
00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:08.250
world, which do tend to be quite hydrogen rich. Yeah. So holmium or base oil,

155
00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:12.180
because if you look at it's near snipers of dispose, yum on erbium,

156
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.850
there's more of them than there is holmium.

157
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.120
So you can see there's a definite dip in between those two,

158
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:19.830
even numbered elements.

159
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.900
<v 1>I don't know. I think it's not so much it's forgettable,</v>

160
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:26.000
but you don't remember it,

161
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:30.050
which is rather forgettable sorts of means that you think about it and then you

162
00:09:30.051 --> 00:09:35.030
forget about it. I would say you're most people never really think about it.

163
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:35.640
So.

164
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.670
<v 0>Say Holman was a little bit pedestrian,</v>

165
00:09:37.671 --> 00:09:41.180
but there's another fact that I've took up about it as well,

166
00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.970
which is in nuclear processes. Uh,

167
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.050
you want to be able to control all of those neutrons flying around.

168
00:09:48.051 --> 00:09:51.260
Otherwise things would get out of control. And, uh,

169
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.200
the element that normally gets there,

170
00:09:53.201 --> 00:09:55.430
the limelight where that's concerned is boron.

171
00:09:55.431 --> 00:09:58.520
It's really good at absorbing what a little known factors.

172
00:09:58.521 --> 00:10:02.780
The holmium is actually quite good at absorbing neutrons as well.

173
00:10:02.781 --> 00:10:07.520
So you can kind of use it as a sacrificial element to keep your nuclear

174
00:10:07.521 --> 00:10:08.600
reactions under control.

175
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:13.250
<v 1>Well, I suppose one of the things that people have said,</v>

176
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:18.020
and there's an article in the latest issue of this journal Nate's of

177
00:10:18.021 --> 00:10:21.170
chemistry, and they have an article about

178
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:27.020
Dave, not tickle about holmium with a,

179
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:32.180
the catchy title homely holmium in which

180
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.460
the important parts of this article say is that they

181
00:10:37.461 --> 00:10:42.200
think the tone medium is the most underused elements.

182
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:46.490
Nobody has really found a good use for it. I'm not sure.

183
00:10:46.491 --> 00:10:51.050
I think there may be other elements that would be a strong contender for this

184
00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:54.590
title, but we should let them have their say.

185
00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.190
The other thing about holmium,

186
00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.750
which I think is important is that it has a pretty prominent

187
00:11:02.751 --> 00:11:04.670
position on this time.

188
00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.580
So whoever designed this Thai clearly thought that homeroom was important.

189
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.120
So perhaps they've got a good application.
