00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.320
<v 0>Many people don't think promethium is very important,</v>

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.340
including the makers of my tie. You can see here,

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.930
press the Damien neodymium and promethium is ran.

4
00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:16.350
The back promethium is element 61,

5
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.240
between neodymium element 60 and samarium element 62.

6
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.040
Now people realize that there must be an element between those two

7
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.990
before promethium was discovered and the way that they

8
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:32.701
argued this,

9
00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:37.050
the way that they thought that there must be an element was by looking at atomic

10
00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:39.750
weights, relative atomic masses.

11
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.750
So this is a book from 1922,

12
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.590
which I bought as a secondhand book. When I was a school,

13
00:00:46.591 --> 00:00:51.150
boy has a table of atomic numbers and the atomic weights.

14
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.050
And down here, you can see the table of the atomic weights.

15
00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.000
Now it's called relative atomic mass between most of these

16
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:00.870
elements,

17
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.820
the difference in weight is somewhere between two

18
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.030
and three units. Occasionally it's a bit more,

19
00:01:09.031 --> 00:01:10.980
but most of the time it's two or three.

20
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.080
And when you come to near Demian and Samir rim, the difference is six.

21
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.940
So the gap just seemed too big. So people thought they must be an element there.

22
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.940
They went through many claims.

23
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.600
We have found element 61, which turned out to be wrong.

24
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.430
And the reason why none of them found it with because element 61,

25
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.320
promethium is radioactive. It's longest lived.

26
00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:41.100
Isotope has a lifetime of 3.7 years.

27
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.410
The most common one is even short-term.

28
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.110
<v 1>It shouldn't that they produced.</v>

29
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.090
There must be one between neodymium and samarium because of the gap

30
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.410
in the, in the waste,

31
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.970
in the masses couldn't they have done the same by looking at the valence of

32
00:01:55.971 --> 00:01:59.870
neodymium and samarium, what those things reacted with and figured out, hang on,

33
00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:03.530
this one must have 60 electrons and this one must have 62.

34
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.230
Therefore there must be one with 61.

35
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.680
<v 0>I think that when people started doing this,</v>

36
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.700
they didn't really know about electrons. As far as I knew,

37
00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:16.400
Mendeleev didn't believe in electrons.

38
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.740
And the other thing is that these elements

39
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.330
not so much promethium,

40
00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:28.010
but the other ones can have variable valence so they can make different

41
00:02:28.011 --> 00:02:31.550
numbers of chlorides or oxide or oxides.

42
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.650
But it is true that one chemist did

43
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.930
use by looking at the reaction of hydrogen that near Demian

44
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.640
reacted with two atoms of hydrogen samarium reacted with

45
00:02:46.641 --> 00:02:51.500
none so that he thought there should be an element that would react with one

46
00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:55.220
atom of hydrogen. So you see bread do you're really clever.

47
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.970
It was only when the Manhattan project,

48
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.040
the nuclear weapons project started in the United States.

49
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.260
When there was a large amount of radioactive research being

50
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:12.610
done that enough radioactive isotopes were

51
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:16.810
formed that people had to chance of detecting it.

52
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.280
And in fact, the paper announcing the discovery of promethium,

53
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.360
not by its name,

54
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:27.340
but as element 61 was published just a few weeks,

55
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.100
probably four weeks before I was born.

56
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.090
So I feel a certain resonance with this element.

57
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.140
We were born a more or less the same time, still a very long time ago.

58
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:39.663
And

59
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.730
I've got the paper here.

60
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.280
And what's interesting about this paper is that it is extremely modest

61
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.470
compared to modern papers,

62
00:03:55.471 --> 00:03:59.550
describing discovery of a new element where their press conferences,

63
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.080
big ceremonies.

64
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.760
You can see our video about some of these ceremonies here at the

65
00:04:05.761 --> 00:04:07.470
end of a paragraph.

66
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.730
It just says in this paper is reported the successful

67
00:04:11.731 --> 00:04:14.460
separation of these three elements.

68
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.110
The first have been achieved with radioisotopes of near Demian.

69
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.780
And these are the four words that describe the new discovery and

70
00:04:24.781 --> 00:04:29.190
development. 61, you can't get much lower key than that.

71
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.740
The paper is by three authors.

72
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.840
Mariinsky Glen tenon and Keryell who were working

73
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.040
at the Clinton laboratories at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

74
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.720
This is a laboratory that has been involved with the birth of many

75
00:04:45.721 --> 00:04:46.554
elements.

76
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.180
Most recently they'd participated in the synthesis of

77
00:04:51.181 --> 00:04:56.040
element, 117 Tennessee, which is named after Tennessee.

78
00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.960
Now, the way that these three authors separated

79
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.750
promethium was by what was then a very new technique called

80
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.030
iron exchange chromatography in which they had the column of

81
00:05:12.031 --> 00:05:15.960
essentially plastic beads that had acid groups on it.

82
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.280
And the element forms, positive irons,

83
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.690
which can interact with the acid to form a salt.

84
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.510
And if you have liquid flowing through the column,

85
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.920
in this case, it was a solution of the salt.

86
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.790
Then if you put in a mixture of metal ions at the top,

87
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:44.280
they are the different elements are attracted with different strengths to

88
00:05:44.281 --> 00:05:47.490
the beads of this solid acid.

89
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.520
And they come out at different times at the bottom.

90
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.950
It turns out that the heaviest element comes out first and they have

91
00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:57.560
grafts,

92
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.420
which show how these different elements come out here.

93
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.950
This is the key graph where they say the

94
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.190
number of liters going along here and the amount of radioactivity that

95
00:06:12.191 --> 00:06:15.370
they measure. And there are different peaks.

96
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.730
And this is the peak for element 61.

97
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.980
Once they have isolated some solution with this element in it,

98
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:29.140
they can distinguish it say from near Demian because the radioactive decay has a

99
00:06:29.141 --> 00:06:30.400
different half-life.

100
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.750
The energy of the electrons coming out is different and so on.

101
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.710
So they knew they had something different. I really liked reading this paper.

102
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.950
I read this one on the trime. When I was going home,

103
00:06:41.951 --> 00:06:46.000
I got really excited by the time the time got to the final stuff,

104
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.680
this element has had a number of different names when people have thought

105
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:51.730
they've discovered it.

106
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:56.050
And hadn't because in the old days there wasn't a committee that looked at the

107
00:06:56.051 --> 00:06:58.660
evidence before no limit was named.

108
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:03.730
So it was called or people thought they would call it Elysium.

109
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.740
Presumably after Illinois Florencia some of the Florence

110
00:07:08.741 --> 00:07:12.700
in Italy site, Clooney, Liam, I don't know what about. And finally,

111
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:17.500
promethium promethium comes from the Greek legendary

112
00:07:17.501 --> 00:07:22.150
figure. Prometheus's who stole fire from the gods.

113
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.680
The naming was a reference to the discovery of nuclear

114
00:07:26.681 --> 00:07:29.020
weapons and in a way,

115
00:07:29.021 --> 00:07:32.980
sort of stealing the power from the gods.

116
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:38.140
The promethium is formed as a product from the

117
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.870
nuclear efficient of other elements.

118
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:45.760
And I think it's important to realize that when say a uranium atom

119
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:51.460
splits, not all the uranium atoms split the same way.

120
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:56.620
So there are a number of different pathways and one of them fairly minor

121
00:07:56.621 --> 00:07:58.660
pathway leads to promethium.

122
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.280
So once people started carrying out nuclear activities on the large

123
00:08:03.281 --> 00:08:05.470
scale nuclear reactors,

124
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:10.840
then in the reaction products, the fishing products,

125
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:15.910
they accumulated significant quantities of promethium so

126
00:08:15.911 --> 00:08:20.800
that you could start thinking about the uses. And there is one use,

127
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.560
which I think is fascinating of promethium,

128
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.190
which is fairly short lived.

129
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.950
It was a good technology,

130
00:08:29.951 --> 00:08:33.610
but it didn't last very long was making batteries.

131
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.130
So-called nuclear batteries.

132
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.630
There are a number of applications where you want a battery to last,

133
00:08:40.631 --> 00:08:44.980
as long as possible. For example, heart pacemakers.

134
00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:49.480
When you have an electrical unit embedded inside somebody's

135
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.120
chest, thankfully I don't have one.

136
00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:57.300
And you want the battery in that case to as long as possible conventional

137
00:08:57.301 --> 00:09:01.770
batteries, even the ones in our phones really don't last very long.

138
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.440
As you probably know, you charge it up every day,

139
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:10.140
but the idea was to make so-called nuclear batteries.

140
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:14.760
And the idea of the promethium battery was that

141
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.900
promethium decays by B2 decay,

142
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.570
that is emitting an electron,

143
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.790
which in itself is promising for making a battery because the electrons

144
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.180
don't go very fast.

145
00:09:28.181 --> 00:09:33.120
So it's easy to stop the electrons coming out of the battery.

146
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:39.150
So the idea is that you mix the promethium with a

147
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:42.990
material, which if the atoms are hit by an electron,

148
00:09:42.991 --> 00:09:45.540
they give out light so-called phosphor.

149
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:49.740
Phosphors used to be used on old-fashioned television screens,

150
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.210
where you had the coating,

151
00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:54.990
which was bombarded by electrons and light came out.

152
00:09:54.991 --> 00:09:56.130
So you could see the picture.

153
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:59.610
So the idea is that you have a mixture of promethium and the phosphor,

154
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:04.620
which glows light comes out and you sandwich this between two

155
00:10:04.621 --> 00:10:09.480
photo sales and the photo sales take the light and produce a

156
00:10:09.481 --> 00:10:10.314
voltage.

157
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:16.320
And it has one enormous advantage over conventional

158
00:10:16.321 --> 00:10:20.250
batteries. The conventional battery like this one,

159
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.560
or the ones you have in your cars are very temperature dependent.

160
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:27.720
If the weather's very cold,

161
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:32.460
it's difficult to start your car because the battery has lower voltage.

162
00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:37.890
The premium battery was much less temperature

163
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:38.753
dependent.

164
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:44.280
So it could be cool to very low temperatures

165
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:49.920
and potentially say on the spacecraft and

166
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.630
would still produce a very similar voltage because it was not relying on the

167
00:10:54.631 --> 00:10:58.590
chemical reaction, but on this photo electric effect,

168
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.330
the problem,

169
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:06.480
and the reason why the technology has now largely been superceded is that

170
00:11:06.481 --> 00:11:09.690
the half-life of the promethium is very short.

171
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:14.700
So the amount of promethium in your battery decayed

172
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.150
by half every two point something years.

173
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.960
So if you were trying to travel to a distant star,

174
