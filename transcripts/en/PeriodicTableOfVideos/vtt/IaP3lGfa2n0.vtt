1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.940
<v 0>We've done lots of experiments with the alkaline metals,</v>

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.220
pop it into the water and see what we can do with the reaction.

3
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.470
You can see the orange sodium flame,

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.220
but our technician Neil felt that we weren't really doing them

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.540
scientifically enough.

6
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.160
We were just dropping alkaline metals into water and seeing what happened.

7
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.580
And we've also done the reverse experiment,

8
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.370
water falling onto sodium.

9
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.080
But what Neil felt is we should do something that was much more controlled.

10
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.330
He wanted to break ampoules glass vessels containing the

11
00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:38.610
alkaline metals underwater.

12
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.530
So we can watch the reaction before there is any air present.

13
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.220
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

14
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.020
<v 0>And also he had the second idea that we should compare the</v>

15
00:01:06.021 --> 00:01:10.250
same number of atoms of the three metals.

16
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.580
The teacher shows sodium potassium and Caesium,

17
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.910
but today I'm going to show you the first experiment,

18
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.910
which was with sodium Neil's device,

19
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.970
begins with a plastic box,

20
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.570
which is filled with water with flat sides.

21
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.400
So you can video and you can see both under the water and what's happening on

22
00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:34.580
the surface. Inside is a device,

23
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.200
which he hasn't made the name yet. I sort of like a thumb screw,

24
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.210
but for test tubes where by turning a soft,

25
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.150
which goes a long way away from the trough,

26
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.920
he can force a metal pin into the side of a test tube

27
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.510
so that it breaks.

28
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.130
And you can film the whole thing at different speeds and from different angles.

29
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.363
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

30
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.300
<v 0>When the tube breaks water rushes in and the reaction starts.</v>

31
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.790
And the only way that the metal can become in contact with air is if

32
00:02:19.791 --> 00:02:21.320
it floats up to the surface

33
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.230
And a cesium tube, it was evacuated without any air.

34
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.020
In some of the other tubes that was air,

35
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.700
you will see in one of our videos, the tube wasn't quite properly sealed.

36
00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:38.630
So it was full of air,

37
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.310
but the amount of air in the tube is very small compared to the amount of

38
00:02:43.311 --> 00:02:46.700
hydrogen that you expect to be generated by full reaction,

39
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.560
the experiments were done outside so that we had bright

40
00:02:51.561 --> 00:02:55.670
sunlight. And also, so if there was an explosion,

41
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.400
it wouldn't cause any harm in the building.

42
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.370
What see is that as the pin starts breaking and the bubbles

43
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.660
are coming out, I believe our hydrogen and the hydrogen,

44
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:11.590
just bubbles up to the surface when it gets to the surface,

45
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.600
there is some cloudiness,

46
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.040
which I think is probably just an optical illusion from the sun.

47
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.900
There may be some mist of water inside it because from sunbank angles,

48
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.130
they look transparent. On the other hand, Neil and Bray,

49
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.150
do you think it might be something we're interesting and I'm prepared to be

50
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:36.070
corrected. If we do more experiments, once the reaction gets going,

51
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:37.420
you get more and more bubbles.

52
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.070
But to begin with there isn't much evidence of any fire

53
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.090
or anything burning the hydrogen just dissipates.

54
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.070
And then gradually the reaction goes more rapidly.

55
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.340
At the end. There is a huge Bush,

56
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.410
which in our first video,

57
00:03:56.411 --> 00:04:00.430
which is about sodium effectively wipes everything out on the screen,

58
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.920
partly because I think heat,

59
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.350
which is generated by these reactions is registered

60
00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:11.260
on video screens as just white light.

61
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.650
What I think happens at the end is that sodium,

62
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.360
which has a density that is quite similar to water is carried up by the

63
00:04:19.361 --> 00:04:20.650
hydrogen bubbles.

64
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.510
And it all reacts on the surface and with the air and explodes,

65
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.080
there are a number of questions that will strike you immediately.

66
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.930
The first thing is it all looks very rapid,

67
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.510
but from the point of view of a chemist, it's really pretty slow.

68
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.760
It took a good fraction of a second,

69
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.290
really fast chemical reactions take place in a nanosecond,

70
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.350
a thousand millionth of a second.

71
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.420
And here we're talking 0.1 of the second something that's quite

72
00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:56.020
slow. So this reaction is fast,

73
00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.630
but it is slow enough for mechanical things like breaking of glass

74
00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:03.040
and so on to take place.

75
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.140
What of course we haven't done is we haven't analyzed the bubbles and shown that

76
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.093
they are hydrogen.

77
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.530
But part of the reason for this is that the reaction of alkaline

78
00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:19.150
metals and water is a very well researched area.

79
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.570
And I've got here a PhD thesis,

80
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.320
reactions of the liquid alkaline metals with water,

81
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.030
which was published in 1976.

82
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.210
This is not cutting edge research. Of course,

83
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.280
we now have high-speed cameras so that we can show you videos nice and

84
00:05:39.281 --> 00:05:41.830
easily. But when these guys were researching,

85
00:05:41.831 --> 00:05:46.360
they had high speed signal cameras. Unfortunately we've lost the film,

86
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.930
but we do have some nice photos.

87
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.640
So what we take with this is that a lot of this is already known.

88
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.000
The reason why this research was being was because in the

89
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:00.410
1970s,

90
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.510
people were building nuclear reactors with hundreds of

91
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:08.000
tons of liquid sodium in them,

92
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.100
which also had water cooling and people wanted to know what would

93
00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:17.000
happen if the sodium leaked into the water system.

94
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.470
So I have an 80 year old colleague now retired,

95
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.840
who supervised this research.

96
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.980
He looks at all our videos with some amusement and says,

97
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.620
when will the young generation ever learn?

98
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.540
His point of view is that you could save a lot of research

99
00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:40.010
time by reading the old papers. In fact,

100
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:45.050
there is a cliche that you can save six months in the lamp

101
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.360
with two hours in the library.

102
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.210
<v 2>So you've seen sodium well</v>

103
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.000
clearly waiting like me to see potassium and Caesium,

104
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.520
but those will be the next speakers.
