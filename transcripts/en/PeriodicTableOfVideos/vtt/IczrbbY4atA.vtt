00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.080
<v 0>When I first got my doctorate and it was called Dr. Poliakoff.</v>

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.330
The only reason that I found the doctorate useful was to complain in

3
00:00:09.331 --> 00:00:13.110
shops. If you telephoned and say, look you, this is not right.

4
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:17.430
If you've said it was Dr. Poliakoff, it produced an effect.

5
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.530
Now I have no idea whether so we'll produce an effect similar

6
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:25.830
effect, or whether people will just love.

7
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.351
<v 1>Each year.</v>

8
00:00:27.351 --> 00:00:30.590
The UK government releases something called the new year's honest list.

9
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.600
This is a whole bunch of people receiving things like MBEs and CBEs and

10
00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:36.590
OBS,

11
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.270
but of particular interest are the people who are receiving knighthoods and Dame

12
00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:43.550
hoods. Now these can be all sorts of people.

13
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.710
They can be sports stars or celebrities,

14
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.890
or very often they might be people you've never heard of who have accomplished

15
00:00:48.891 --> 00:00:52.970
things or done many years of service behind the scenes. But this year,

16
00:00:52.971 --> 00:00:57.590
one of the people being recognized with a knighthood is our very own professor

17
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.620
Martin Poliakoff. Now, of course, first and foremost,

18
00:01:00.621 --> 00:01:02.990
he's been recognized for his work over many years,

19
00:01:02.991 --> 00:01:05.060
as a chemist at the university of Nottingham.

20
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.200
He's also been recognized for his work as an ambassador for science in recent

21
00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:12.260
years as foreign secretary of the Royal society,

22
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.450
but of particular interest to me,

23
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.600
and perhaps you who watches these videos is another thing.

24
00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:19.430
And it's written on this citation here,

25
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.110
that Martin has been recognized for his work in engaging the public with

26
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.910
chemistry, including through the periodic table of videos on YouTube.

27
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.350
Here it is in black and white. So anyway, I had a quick chat with, well,

28
00:01:33.351 --> 00:01:34.220
I guess I should call him.

29
00:01:34.221 --> 00:01:38.630
So Martin just a few days ago and asked him how he felt about the whole thing.

30
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.970
<v 0>I already have a lower on the so-called commander of the order of the British</v>

31
00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:48.200
empire, which has a nice cross, which I have worn,

32
00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:50.840
I think in total three or four times.

33
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.040
And once when I had to go down the street wearing this,

34
00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:57.710
I buttoned that my anorak right at the top,

35
00:01:57.711 --> 00:02:02.150
so that nobody should see this when I was going down the street, the knighthood,

36
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.710
as far as I remember,

37
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.910
and I've seen quite a lot of people wearing this is a sort of oval reddish

38
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.720
colored medallion, and now university. It is quite rare.

39
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.600
So Peter Mansfield, the Nobel prize,

40
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.530
when the discover or inventor of MRI,

41
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.120
our former vice chancellor,

42
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.200
Colin Campbell was knighted and I present vice chancellor.

43
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.090
So David Greenaway was knighted actually only a few months

44
00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:29.720
ago.

45
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.520
<v 2>Of course has got it for I've been awarded it because this is somebody who is a</v>

46
00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:36.200
top scientist and a top school.

47
00:02:36.201 --> 00:02:39.860
Somebody who's been a fabulous communicator who has done so much through a

48
00:02:39.861 --> 00:02:43.850
period table of videos to raise interest in, in the science.

49
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.620
But he's also part of a university community that he's grown up in.

50
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.820
He's been here 35 years and part of the university community is very proud of

51
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.810
what he's done. So this is a huge honor for the university,

52
00:02:56.811 --> 00:03:00.100
as well as for Martin personally, and the ceremony.

53
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.750
<v 0>Which I've never seen.</v>

54
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:06.580
But I've heard about is that you are touched on the shoulder

55
00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:10.570
by the queen or a member of the Royal family with a sword,

56
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.700
just like you see in pictures in medieval battlefields. And so on there,

57
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:19.150
I think the soul they use is rather lighter and less sharp.

58
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.090
<v 2>Yes, indeed. There was a sword. It's not a myth. I was tapped on both shoulders.</v>

59
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.400
The only thing that was missing was a rice, a David,

60
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.170
that that bit doesn't actually happen

61
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.140
beforehand. They,

62
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.290
they take them for briefing and there's a stool there and they take you through

63
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.750
kneeling down and so on. And to be honest, I thought, well,

64
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.270
what's the point of that, but it did it. And an official came up to me and said,

65
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.610
uh, so David, when, when you went down, you instinctively put your head down,

66
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.370
do not do that, keep your head up.

67
00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.160
Otherwise you don't see what's happening and you'll miss the moment.

68
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.470
And it was wonderful advice. I kept my head up.

69
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.690
There was lovely eye contact there.

70
00:04:03.691 --> 00:04:07.530
You can see the sword coming down that taps both shoulders. And, um,

71
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.590
then, uh, majesty had, uh,

72
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.450
a few words asked about my career as an economist and asked about work here at

73
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.970
university.

74
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.960
<v 0>People in the UK are still really quite formal.</v>

75
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.880
So if you're a professor you're called professor with your certain names.

76
00:04:22.881 --> 00:04:24.750
So I'm called professor Poliakoff.

77
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.140
I prefer to people to use my first name and call me Martin.

78
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.350
So the tradition is that when somebody gets a knighthood,

79
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.190
they are called so in their Christian names. So in my case,

80
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.910
so Martin they're in full, I would be professors.

81
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.620
So Martin Poliakoff,

82
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.780
but nobody in their right mind would actually say that they might write it in

83
00:04:45.781 --> 00:04:49.890
a formal documents. It is, I think for a combination of reasons,

84
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.870
I think it is partly through my role at the Royal society

85
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.420
as an ambassador for UK science,

86
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.190
but also it is for my role in chemistry,

87
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.420
partly my research in green and sustainable chemistry,

88
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.290
but also for my, um, efforts,

89
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:11.880
thanks to you,

90
00:05:11.881 --> 00:05:16.650
the YouTube watches to promote chemistry through YouTube.

91
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.720
I think it may be the first time that YouTube has been mentioned when

92
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.970
somebody has got to knighthood. And so I feel really, quite proud about that.

93
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.440
And I also really want to thank you, YouTube viewers,

94
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.030
who've made this possible through your enthusiasm for chemistry. So in a way,

95
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.030
this is an honor that we can all share together.

96
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.220
I see this very much as an honor for the whole of the school of

97
00:05:44.221 --> 00:05:46.920
chemistry at the university of Nottingham where I work.

98
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.840
So I see this as a reward, not only for myself,

99
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.670
but for my colleagues working this area and particularly for my research

100
00:05:56.671 --> 00:06:00.860
team and my close colleagues who work with me in this team

101
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.320
and also for our technical staff who make all the equipment

102
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.900
that allows us to do the experiments.

103
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.900
I think my wife is fairly neutral about it. There,

104
00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:16.340
it should be pointed out that there is rather unfortunate sex

105
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:20.300
discrimination that when a male is knighted,

106
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.100
his wife gets the courtesy title of

107
00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:28.640
lady. But if a woman is made the Dame,

108
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.160
her husband's doesn't get anything.

109
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:36.170
I'm not sure what my wife's attitude to being called lady will

110
00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:40.610
be. And that that's up to her, whether she uses the title or not fantastic.

111
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.350
<v 2>Public recognition. And, um, you know,</v>

112
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.700
that on there aren't many of them. Uh, and,

113
00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:50.980
and I think the university having the opportunity to celebrate

114
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:56.470
an accolade like this for someone who's as loyal and as committed

115
00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.180
and as straightforward as Martin is just a wonderful thing.

116
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:08.230
<v 0>I think perhaps what I need to remember is that when I</v>

117
00:07:08.231 --> 00:07:12.100
was made a professor in 1990, 24 years ago,

118
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.220
my son sent me a birthday card.

119
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.430
It was announced fortuitously on my birthday.

120
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:24.310
And it said at the end PS, don't be pompous like other profs.

121
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:29.530
And I think this is really a very good attitude to have to all these

122
00:07:29.531 --> 00:07:32.230
on those. I'm delighted to have it,

123
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.500
but I mustn't let it get the better of me.
