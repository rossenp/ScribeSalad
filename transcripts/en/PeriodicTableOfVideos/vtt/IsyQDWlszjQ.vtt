00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.950
<v 0>What is the most important journal paper published in chemistry</v>

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.480
during your lifetime?

3
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.360
<v 1>I have no idea. Um, there are a number of papers,</v>

4
00:00:14.361 --> 00:00:18.560
which I think are obviously very landmark papers,

5
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.170
I suppose. The first in my lifetime,

6
00:00:21.171 --> 00:00:25.820
that was really all my scientific lifetime was the fact that

7
00:00:25.821 --> 00:00:29.480
Xenon could react with flooring or PTF sex,

8
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.440
which really caused a big shift in people's thinking,

9
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.570
I think the publication,

10
00:00:35.571 --> 00:00:39.680
the paper about 60 the molecule,

11
00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:44.030
buckyballs also changed. People's thinking quite a lot,

12
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.380
but many of these key papers in chemistry

13
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.900
have been

14
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.940
once the people have understood them,

15
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.640
they become almost obvious.

16
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.030
But I think if I should be honest,

17
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.600
and this was paper that was published in 1952.

18
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.570
So when I was four and a half years old,

19
00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:11.180
so it was before my scientific lifetime,

20
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.310
I would say probably the most important paper was the paper by cricket and

21
00:01:16.311 --> 00:01:19.820
Watson about the structure of DNA. In the sense,

22
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.690
it gave us more understanding about the

23
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.460
mechanism of life and ideas on

24
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.660
hereditary, how to cure diseases and so on than anything else.

25
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.160
But I can't say that I really took it in though.

26
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.990
I can remember as a teenager reading a newspaper article about the

27
00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:42.950
structure of DNA,

28
00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:47.540
it was probably when Crick and Watson got their Nobel prize in the early

29
00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:52.520
sixties. And I got really excited about that and told my father,

30
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.040
this is what I wanted to do when I grew up.

31
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.360
<v 0>How do we know the shape and arrangement of complex molecules?</v>

32
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.790
<v 1>The most obvious way is by using x-ray crystallography,</v>

33
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.660
which can tell you the position of atoms and molecules.

34
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.290
It can't tell you whether they bonded together or not,

35
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.960
but because that depends on the electrons,

36
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.700
but it can tell you where one atom is relative to another. Next year,

37
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.000
2014 is the international year of crystallography.

38
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.630
And so we'll probably be doing several videos about it then.

39
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.670
So keep watching for that.

40
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.690
The most exciting development is a technique called scanning tunneling

41
00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:36.230
microscopy, where by moving a tip,

42
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.800
very sharp tip across the surface,

43
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.160
you can actually feel the shape of a molecule.

44
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.990
Rather like somebody who's blind can feel the shape of

45
00:02:47.991 --> 00:02:50.390
something on the table, even though they can't see it.

46
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.580
And that is revealing the shapes of molecules in really

47
00:02:55.581 --> 00:02:56.840
quite a lot of detail.

48
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.200
And perhaps that's the most unexpected development,

49
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:05.820
the whole of my scientific career, the idea that you can actually image Molly.

50
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.230
<v 0>Why did you choose chemistry over the other sciences when you were in high</v>

51
00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:11.100
school or college?

52
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.370
<v 1>I'm ashamed to say that I only had one school term,</v>

53
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.780
which is about eight weeks of biology in the whole of my career.

54
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.660
And looking back on it it's much more,

55
00:03:24.661 --> 00:03:28.620
what would now be called nature study than modern biology.

56
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.260
I then studied chemistry and physics and my father and

57
00:03:34.261 --> 00:03:39.060
grandfather were physicists. So I wanted to become a physicist.

58
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.400
I wasn't good enough at maths.

59
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.090
I had a near photographic memory as a child.

60
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.220
So learning chemistry was very easy. I was,

61
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.590
must've been a pupil for, from hell for my chemistry teacher.

62
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.160
I talk to my friends all the time in the class,

63
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.810
but I could answer every question like that, except once.

64
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.740
And I never seen a bigger smile on the face of a teacher than that.

65
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.810
<v 0>Do you remember what the question was? No. That one didn't get photographed.</v>

66
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.610
What is one discovery that you think will come after your lifetime and how will

67
00:04:17.611 --> 00:04:18.600
it change our lives?

68
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.200
<v 1>That's very interesting question.</v>

69
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.870
And the answer is that if we could predict what the discovery would be,

70
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.540
it probably wouldn't change our lives. All that much.

71
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.220
A lot is made of quantum computing,

72
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.760
which people now in theory knows what it should do,

73
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.630
but in practice have a moving towards it.

74
00:04:42.631 --> 00:04:47.400
But haven't got very far what might happen even in my lifetime is

75
00:04:47.401 --> 00:04:51.840
the manufacturing of synthetic organisms.

76
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.380
So-called synthetic biology in which one could

77
00:04:58.381 --> 00:04:59.970
create bacteria.

78
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.020
And this could transform the way that we make chemicals,

79
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.970
because you could make a bacterium,

80
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.050
which within reason could convert this compound into that one.

81
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.030
You'll never make a bacterium that can convert late into gold,

82
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.790
but you could one organic compound into another.

83
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.110
<v 0>What is the highest possible atomic number for an element?</v>

84
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.820
<v 1>If you work for the international union of pure and applied chemistry,</v>

85
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.013
they don't send

86
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.600
999 because they worked out a system for naming elements up through

87
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.520
999.

88
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.770
I think the answer is that these elements become more

89
00:05:40.771 --> 00:05:44.520
and more unstable as you go up. There's still some argument,

90
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.040
whether elements are 119 hundred and 20 will be synthesized anytime

91
00:05:50.041 --> 00:05:50.874
soon,

92
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.800
there is some suggestion that they will be so-called islands of stability.

93
00:05:55.801 --> 00:06:00.440
That is you go through a lot unstable elements and then you will come to some

94
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:04.400
really stable elements. And quite a long time ago,

95
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.810
nearly 40 years ago,

96
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.820
somebody published a paper in which they looked at some mineral called

97
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.250
Micah. That's the one that comes in sheets,

98
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.910
rather like sheets of glass and found some strange spots,

99
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.410
which they interpreted as the decay of super-heavy elements.

100
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.800
Everyone got really excited, turned out to be rubbish.

101
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:30.070
<v 0>How has the introduction of computers changed the way you think about or do</v>

102
00:06:30.071 --> 00:06:30.904
chemistry?

103
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.120
<v 1>When our department,</v>

104
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.560
I wasn't working here got the first computer that people ordinary users could

105
00:06:38.561 --> 00:06:39.970
use and program,

106
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.470
I thought it was a bit boring and didn't want to use it.

107
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.720
But then I found that I could predict the spectrum of the molecules that I was

108
00:06:49.721 --> 00:06:51.550
making. And I got really hooked.

109
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.370
I spent a thousand minutes a week of computing time.

110
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:02.680
That was the limit and the computer terminal sort of chunk the way in a

111
00:07:02.681 --> 00:07:05.740
little conservatory in the department.

112
00:07:05.741 --> 00:07:08.080
And I would go and visit it every few minutes.

113
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.990
It's been enormously important.

114
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.860
I think in the way that people publish chemistry.

115
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.510
Very few people now have paper copies of journals.

116
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.800
They publish everything electronically,

117
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.680
get them down as PDF files.

118
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:31.720
And it's also had a huge effect with people collaborating via

119
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.260
instant messaging, very email and so on.

120
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.010
So that one can talk to somebody on the other side of the world and do an

121
00:07:39.011 --> 00:07:39.850
experiment together.

122
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.620
<v 0>As a chemist. What motivates you to keep going.</v>

123
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.610
<v 1>Doing research is to some extent,</v>

124
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:51.850
almost like an addiction,

125
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.960
you keep on needing more and more to keep going.

126
00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.910
I suppose that the reason I really keep going is because I

127
00:08:00.911 --> 00:08:01.780
enjoy it.

128
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:07.150
And because nature that is what's

129
00:08:07.151 --> 00:08:11.320
around us rather than the journal nature is so fascinating

130
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.460
because even quite boring experiments

131
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.670
can turn out to be really exciting.

132
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:23.200
And everything that we discover

133
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.670
about nature is clever than we expect.

134
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.830
<v 0>And what's your biggest disappointment.</v>

135
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.580
<v 1>I'm not sure what my biggest disappointment is.</v>

136
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.900
I think scientists tend to live in the present.

137
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:39.190
It's difficult to say.

138
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:43.630
I have a friend who worked in industry who did some

139
00:08:43.631 --> 00:08:48.400
experiments with rating carbon and produced a red solution,

140
00:08:48.401 --> 00:08:50.770
which we now know is C 60,

141
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:56.370
but he didn't have time to analyze it because his industrial required something

142
00:08:56.371 --> 00:09:01.230
else. So he could have discovered [inaudible] long before other people.

143
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.740
I don't think in my career,

144
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.970
I feel that I have overlooked various things.

145
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.920
I suppose there are a number of occasions where I've said an idea was stupid

146
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.820
and then somebody else has gone and done it and shown that it works.

147
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.860
But in that case, I think one can just laugh and say,

148
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.330
well, they brighten me and be pleased that they've got the thing to work.

149
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.570
What is your proudest scientific achievement? And why?

150
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:35.610
I think one really gets quite excited

151
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.300
about whatever is the current experiments you're doing.

152
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:44.970
There are one or two things which I have done,

153
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.560
which are not big achievements, but I think without being arrogant,

154
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.900
that I, I was quite clever to think of them.

155
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.410
Even though the actual idea was not voluminous importance.

156
00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.930
Many years ago, my professor took a sabbatical year.

157
00:10:00.931 --> 00:10:05.610
He took a whole term off to do experiments and he worked really hard,

158
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:11.310
but he couldn't understand his results. And I came and sat on the,

159
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.750
um, lab stool next to him and made the suggestion,

160
00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.250
which explained everything.

161
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:23.340
And of course I felt quite clever turns out that the

162
00:10:23.341 --> 00:10:25.980
experiment was very little importance.

163
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:31.230
I doubt if anybody has read the paper about it for nearly 40

164
00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:33.870
years, but I still feel quite pleased.

165
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:36.990
But I think in the end,

166
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:43.770
people like me, senior scientists are a bit like parents.

167
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:49.050
And the thing that really makes me proud is when I see my former

168
00:10:49.051 --> 00:10:53.700
students, my former post-docs doing really well in science,

169
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.620
getting prizes, becoming professors themselves. And that's,

170
00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:59.463
I suppose,

171
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.290
is in some ways by far the biggest reward for being a scientist

172
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:09.030
that I learned from terrific scientists before me.
