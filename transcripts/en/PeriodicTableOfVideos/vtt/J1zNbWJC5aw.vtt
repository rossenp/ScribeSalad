00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.130
<v 0>I recently read an article,</v>

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.540
which suggested that the periodic table that we love,

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.960
we see everywhere on the wall of your classroom,

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.570
on your t-shirt on your mouse mat,

5
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.740
perhaps even your books or shorts may be wrong.

6
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.980
And that was a huge surprise for me.

7
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.660
So let me try and explain to you what the problem is here.

8
00:00:23.661 --> 00:00:27.830
We've got the so-called ultra long periodic table,

9
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.650
where in these two bottom rows,

10
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.690
you have the elements listed in numerical order of their atomic numbers.

11
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.250
So they go here, bear in 56 length and then 57 serum,

12
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.570
58 and so on.

13
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.610
And the one below you have radium 88 actinium

14
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.350
89. And so on this sort of shape doesn't fit very well.

15
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.640
Well on to walls, into books,

16
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.600
onto mouse mats, onto boxer shorts. Normally, yeah,

17
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.460
you have one like this where this block of elements has

18
00:01:04.461 --> 00:01:06.830
been snipped out and put underneath.

19
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.200
And so lanthanum and actinium Aronda scandium and

20
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.550
itching room. Lanthanum has a little red spot on top of it,

21
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.500
which means this lot had been left out. And if you look at the numbers,

22
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.560
they jump from 57 to 72,

23
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.100
and then the road below the two stars for this row.

24
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.800
And you jumped from element 89 to run the food in 104.

25
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.780
If we look at this rather unusual period it

26
00:01:38.781 --> 00:01:39.614
table,

27
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.060
which was given to me by one of our YouTube fans,

28
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.720
what you can see is that there are two spaces here.

29
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.080
And instead of being 14 elements there,

30
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.530
15 elements underneath and lanthanum,

31
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.400
and actinium instead of being there been put there. Now,

32
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.050
let me explain what the paper was that I looked at the paper,

33
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.080
which has a slightly and promising title measurement.

34
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.650
The first ionization potential of Lauryn SIM element

35
00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:16.340
103 Lorenz SIM is this element at the end,

36
00:02:16.341 --> 00:02:20.090
here is experimentally at triumph.

37
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.070
Lorenzo Liam is an so-called super heavy element.

38
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.820
You have to synthesize it in accelerators.

39
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.240
It has a very short half-life. The isotope,

40
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.410
they were measuring has a half-life of 27 seconds.

41
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.530
That means after 27 seconds,

42
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.780
half your Lorenz SIM is gone and they were doing measurements on individual

43
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.670
atoms, and they were measuring a slightly obscure quantity.

44
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.250
The so-called first organization, energy,

45
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.360
which is the amount of energy she required to remove the first electron.

46
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.110
And what they discovered was SIM has a very low first-time

47
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.200
nitration energy and quite pleasingly.

48
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.370
You can see that the value that has been measured

49
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.320
4.96 electron volts is almost identical

50
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:16.540
to what's has been calculated by theory,

51
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.180
but what's this got to do with the periodic table.

52
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.220
What they're suggesting is that lutetium and Lorenzo Liam

53
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.470
should be sitting under the standard Monotreme that is the

54
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:34.030
big break in the periodic table should actually come there

55
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.380
rather than there. So if you have the short form,

56
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.580
you would have the dot over radium. You'd go down to that.

57
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.650
Technium you'd go along to new billion and then up here to Lorenz. Yeah.

58
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.880
So what they're saying is that the properties of Lorencia

59
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.670
are much more like instrument scandium then

60
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.620
the properties of lanthanum and a 10 year Mar their argument

61
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.270
is that the ionization energies of Lorenz SIM

62
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.650
fit much better with those of this group.

63
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.790
Then the analyzations of lanthanum Tanium do so,

64
00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:19.420
what they are saying, bluntly is lanthanum,

65
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.340
and actinium probably shouldn't be in group three lutetium and

66
00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:29.320
Lorenz Siham should be in group three because the way the periodic

67
00:04:29.321 --> 00:04:30.580
table is structured,

68
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.370
you would expect there to be elements at the bottom of group three.

69
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.530
Now, of course,

70
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.110
this is partly theoretical because there are only a few atoms

71
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:46.390
of Lorenz SIM have been made.

72
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.980
So it's not as if you are going to start using Lorenz SIM for making

73
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.710
catalysts or whatever, but on the other hand,

74
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.300
it is quite important for understanding of the structure of the periodic table.

75
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.010
<v 1>My memory of chemistry from school is rather hazy, but I seem to recall,</v>

76
00:05:02.011 --> 00:05:04.320
we were told which elements went in,

77
00:05:04.321 --> 00:05:08.940
which group depended on how many electrons were available for

78
00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:11.310
business in that outer valence shell. Yeah.

79
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.190
And we know how many electrons that are in the outer show,

80
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.370
surely for all of these elements. So it doesn't dictate it.

81
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.790
Now you're telling me it's done experimentally by ionization energies.

82
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.410
<v 0>In this road here from scandium to zinc and all the others</v>

83
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.300
you're filling up the so-called DS shells of the electrons.

84
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.770
And down here, you're filling up the so-called F shell.

85
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.700
What this argument boils down to is that

86
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.670
they're saying that perhaps rather than putting in one DL electron,

87
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.370
and then filling up the F shell, you put in, fill up the FCL.

88
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.200
And then at the D electron,

89
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.800
it could be that the break is different in the two rows.

90
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.720
It could be that lanthanum is here and

91
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.430
Lorenz is there. And that the break doesn't happen in the same place,

92
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.650
in the two rows.

93
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.200
That will be a real mess for the people who draw periodic tables.

94
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.450
But what we're interested in is what nature is like,

95
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.400
not how easy it is to draw it.

96
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.363
<v 2>So, um,</v>

97
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.360
we're braving the elements Brady to repeat the experiment that we did quite some

98
00:06:28.361 --> 00:06:29.260
time ago, heat.

99
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.340
<v 3>That till it's warm and put it in the chlorine declawing and oxidize it to</v>

100
00:06:33.341 --> 00:06:33.700
include.
