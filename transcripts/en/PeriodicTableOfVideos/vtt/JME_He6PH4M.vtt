00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.680
<v 0>Nitrogen triad died is a well-known compound that has been used by</v>

2
00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:08.730
chemical pranksters. Since I don't know when,

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.990
when I was a school, boy, I made some, and it went off with a nucleus.

4
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.343
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

5
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.470
<v 0>When you make it, it comes out as a damp,</v>

6
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.720
rather dark colored compound.

7
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.760
When you spread it out on the surface to dry it dries relatively

8
00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:42.320
quickly and then becomes a so-called contact explosive.

9
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.820
If you touch it even very gently, it can go off with a live bang.

10
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.710
So what we did was to put it on a warm surface,

11
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.050
Neil had a hot plate with a metal sheet on top to protect it.

12
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.290
And it was put on the filter paper to dry,

13
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.050
took quite a long time to dry nearly half now,

14
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.970
but then he touched it off with a new tool that is

15
00:01:07.971 --> 00:01:11.420
invented, which he called a professor on the stick.

16
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.300
Like most chemical reactions.

17
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.390
It needs some energy to set it off,

18
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.500
but this one needs very little energy, physical energy,

19
00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:25.940
just rubbing two crystals together is enough to get it going.

20
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.010
So it's rather like something that is about to overbalance and you

21
00:01:31.011 --> 00:01:32.810
just need to give it a little push.

22
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.710
And the result was pretty dramatic.

23
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.370
So the chemistry is really quite simple and I three dissociates

24
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.170
into nitrogen gas and to an ID and end to

25
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.100
has a very strong bond between the two nitrogen atoms.

26
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.970
So it releases a lot of energy very quickly.

27
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.110
And as it releases the energy, of course it accelerates the reaction.

28
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.370
And so it all goes off or nearly all goes off at once.

29
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.090
You also get a cloud of ID in vapor,

30
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.850
which is a sort of brownie purple color. In fact,

31
00:02:28.851 --> 00:02:33.800
the unfortunate little professor disappears among the clouds and

32
00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:37.130
comes out covered in ID though,

33
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.810
I managed to wash the ID in of the professor using sodium

34
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.780
sulfate, occasionally will go off spontaneously like my sample in my locker at

35
00:02:47.781 --> 00:02:48.710
school. Well,

36
00:02:48.711 --> 00:02:53.060
my experience was that like many people they've tried to make quite a large

37
00:02:53.061 --> 00:02:57.770
amount. It was hidden in my locker. So the teacher shouldn't find it.

38
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.870
And then it dried out when I opened the door,

39
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.150
whatever I did was enough to set it off. So there was a big bang. Fortunately,

40
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.050
I was not in any way hurt, but it was quite a lesson to me.

41
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.360
Chlorine compounds,

42
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.770
nitrogen tri chloride is a liquid and is far worse.

43
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.020
The French chemist peered you long,

44
00:03:28.021 --> 00:03:32.820
who discovered it lost an eye and two fingers,

45
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.390
or some people say three fingers when it exploded.

46
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.430
And when Humphrey Davey in London was trying to repeat the experiment.

47
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.720
He got some glass in his eye, then his assistant,

48
00:03:45.721 --> 00:03:49.200
Michael Faraday tried it and injured his hand.

49
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.180
And one whose fingernails came off.

50
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.290
So nitrogen trifluoride is truly dreadful compound,

51
00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.330
but the TRIA died because it's a solid has been used for

52
00:04:00.331 --> 00:04:02.460
many, many years. And in fact,

53
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.140
we discovered in the archives here a really quite nice account

54
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.310
of a debate between two university teams,

55
00:04:11.311 --> 00:04:15.210
one from Nottingham and one from Swanzey that took place in

56
00:04:15.211 --> 00:04:17.730
1928. One of the students,

57
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.500
no Kuser wrote in the account. So it begins quite formerly.

58
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.360
There was an InterVarsity between university debate that year at

59
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.360
Nottingham, it was held in the lounge theater.

60
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.010
He then explains how the students were very badly behaved shooting

61
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.170
peas out of pea shooters from their mouths, at the audience in the front,

62
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.320
and then on the people debating on the stage.

63
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.330
But what the people on the stage didn't know was that the pranksters were

64
00:04:48.331 --> 00:04:52.530
chemistry students and they had put nitrogen TRIA died,

65
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.590
which was damp all over the stage.

66
00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.060
So one of the people from Swanzey got up and was walking up and down the stage,

67
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.130
trying to calm everything down.

68
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.370
And then it happens the nitrogen tri iodide liberally

69
00:05:08.371 --> 00:05:13.200
spread earlier on the platform began to dry out and each step of the

70
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.330
SWAT ANSI man produced alarming crackles and bangs until

71
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.980
all those on the days,

72
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.110
that's the stage disappeared up to their knees in a valid

73
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.010
haze. At this point, the proceedings were called off.

74
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.140
So you see even a long time ago, students could be really badly behaved.

75
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.730
In fact, far more badly behaved than would be permitted. Nowadays.

76
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:39.750
That's a university,

77
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.520
obviously this is not the sort of reaction you should try at

78
00:05:44.521 --> 00:05:49.110
home because this compound is terribly unstable.

79
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.180
It is being used by people because even microscopic

80
00:05:54.181 --> 00:05:58.730
amounts make quite a loud bang and it's particularly dangerous.

81
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.070
If you make a large amount of this material,

82
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.370
even in the live where we were working, making this video,

83
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.170
we spilled some on the floor

84
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.800
and they were crackles for an hour or two afterwards.

85
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.850
Hi, you probably just heard the professor mentioned.

86
00:06:15.851 --> 00:06:20.290
Sometimes you can suffer a premature detonation of your nitrogen.

87
00:06:20.291 --> 00:06:25.240
Tried it. We did experience such a problem, and we also captured it on video.

88
00:06:25.241 --> 00:06:28.930
If you'd like to see it, I'll include a link in the video description.

89
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.850
And while I have your attention,

90
00:06:33.851 --> 00:06:37.480
can I also just thank everyone who supports periodic videos on Patrion,

91
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:42.400
helping us go the extra mile details about that can also be found down below the

92
00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:42.850
video.
