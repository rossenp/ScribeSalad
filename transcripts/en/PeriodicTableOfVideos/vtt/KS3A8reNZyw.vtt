00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:11.720
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.280
<v 1>I'm going to show you a reaction,</v>

3
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.500
which I didn't know could occur the reaction between magnesium and water.

4
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.150
The reason why I didn't know it can occur is quite simple.

5
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.540
Let's look at this experiment here.

6
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.670
I've got a piece of magnesium ribbon and Cymbalta.

7
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.430
You see the, if I add the water,

8
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.520
absolutely nothing happens.

9
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.740
I didn't really think with the magnesium could react with water. However,

10
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.340
Neil has done some quite exciting experiments,

11
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.330
which Brady has videoed in slow motion.

12
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.560
So what Neil did was to take bits of magnesium

13
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.350
set fire to them in the air.

14
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.120
So they were burning really brightly and then gently

15
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.100
load them into a large container of water. As with all his experiments,

16
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.320
he began on quite a smooth

17
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.020
And the first experiment, it's all quite dark.

18
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.600
You can't see the water very well at all,

19
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.050
but you can see the magnesium as it comes in.

20
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.930
<v 0>Yep.</v>

21
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.740
<v 1>I found really quite surprising is that the burning magnesium</v>

22
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.820
continues to burn underwater. In fact,

23
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.530
bits of it start coming out of the water again, breaking off.

24
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.650
And that came to me as a real surprise to begin with.

25
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.180
But then I realized that the magnesium is pretty hot,

26
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.250
close to its melting point.

27
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.230
Its melting point is only 650 degrees centigrade. And in fact,

28
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.190
in some of the shots, you can see bits dropping off the magnesium,

29
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.280
even before it gets to the water because.

30
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:10.723
<v 0>Smoking.</v>

31
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.380
<v 1>When it goes into the water, you will have a very clean surface of magnesium.</v>

32
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.560
And so there is no oxide layer to protect the magnesium

33
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.710
as there is in the water that we've got here,

34
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.890
where the magnesium is coated in a layer of oxide.

35
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.310
So it's insulated if you like from the water.

36
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.960
So you have very high types of water and clean magnesium.

37
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.210
And so you can get a reaction of magnesium producing

38
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.060
magnesium oxide and hydrogen.

39
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.170
It might be magnesium hydroxide, but you will get hydrogen.

40
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.060
So you have an exothermic reaction making the

41
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.950
oxide or hydroxide and you're producing hydrogen,

42
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:06.610
which itself can burn and could cause a minor explosion.

43
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.530
It's a bit like sodium, but not quite so fun.

44
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.930
Neil then tried it on a bigger scale

45
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.990
And there it's really nice. You can see,

46
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.800
as the magnesium goes close to the water surface,

47
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.640
you can see its reflection coming up to meet it.

48
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.950
The reflection of the burning magnesium.

49
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.470
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

50
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.880
<v 1>And then there is a few seconds</v>

51
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.223
of video,

52
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.120
which was much shorter time because it's been slowed down in reality.

53
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.670
Then there's really quite a violent reaction and pieces of burning

54
00:03:56.671 --> 00:03:58.380
magnesium fly out. In fact,

55
00:03:58.381 --> 00:04:02.490
some fly out completely outside the container.

56
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.653
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

57
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.320
<v 1>Then being Neal. He tried an even bigger piece.</v>

58
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.590
Then what's happened. Is that again,

59
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.090
you see the burning magnesium approaching its

60
00:04:42.091 --> 00:04:44.310
reflection on once it goes in,

61
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.130
you get a really violent reaction.

62
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.370
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

63
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.550
<v 1>There is quite a nice red color that is formed.</v>

64
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.920
I'm not sure whether this is the emission from hot

65
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.420
magnesium atoms.

66
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.100
We've seen these sorts of emissions in the reactions of rubidium and sodium

67
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.430
or whether it is just the hydrogen gas burning,

68
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.990
because we've also seen in some of our videos that hydrogen gas in the absence

69
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.960
of excess air will burn with a reddish color,

70
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.710
but there is a quite a nice red color formed as well.

71
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.970
So what can we learn from all of these chemistries? Often unexpected.

72
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.280
I'd never seen the reaction of magnesium with water and

73
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.350
it is the high temperature.

74
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.010
And the fact that it's liquid that is causing this reaction to take place.

75
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.830
If you look at the periodic table,

76
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.730
calcium reacts quite easily with water.

77
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.060
Calcium is the element immediately below magnesium.

78
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.350
So it's not surprising that magnesium also reacts with water,

79
00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.710
but chemists usually forget that I did ask Neil why he'd

80
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:02.330
ever tried this experiment.

81
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.550
And the answer is that he was burning a piece of magnesium in these fume

82
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.680
companies and the fire got a bit bigger than he really liked.

83
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:18.020
So he puts it into some water and it's an amazement. It went on burning.

84
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.990
So the real take home message for all of you is that if you have a metal

85
00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:28.580
fire, the last thing you want to do is to put water on it.

86
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.010
This is probably why during the world Wars people use

87
00:06:34.011 --> 00:06:37.940
magnesium bombs as incendiary devices,

88
00:06:37.941 --> 00:06:42.500
because once the bomb starts burning, you can't put it up with water.

89
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.220
Sometimes they use phosphorus. Often they use magnesium.

90
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.990
If ever you're working with metals at high temperature and they start burning,

91
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.750
you signed, don't use water.

92
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:59.140
<v 2>Professor. If we scraped the oxide of that piece of magnesium ribbon,</v>

93
00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.860
would it react with the water at all? Like, do you need the heat?

94
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.410
<v 1>I have no idea. I wondered myself whether this would happen.</v>

95
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:13.300
My feeling is that there might be a reaction, but it would be pretty slow.

96
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.760
That is if we clean the magnesium,

97
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.400
perhaps electrochemically or something like that,

98
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.610
eventually we might see a few bubbles of hydrogen,

99
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.910
but it's partly the high temperature,

100
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.360
the molten metal that really gets the thing to take off.

101
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.440
So the answer is it might react,

102
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.150
but it wouldn't make a good video.

103
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.280
So if you'd like to see another great magnesium reaction,

104
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:44.500
you can see the video we made a little while ago of magnesium reacting with

105
00:07:44.501 --> 00:07:46.810
solid CO2. Again,

106
00:07:46.811 --> 00:07:51.640
magnesium is extracting oxygen from a molecule CO2 that we

107
00:07:51.641 --> 00:07:53.830
would normally expect to be pretty stable.

108
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:59.110
The difference between its reaction with water and CO2 is that

109
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:03.700
the carbon leaves doesn't burn. You just see a black residue.

110
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.630
The hydrogen adds a little warmth to the experiment.
