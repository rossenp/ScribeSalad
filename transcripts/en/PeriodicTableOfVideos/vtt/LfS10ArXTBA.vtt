1
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.240
<v 0>Lithium is the lightest metal.</v>

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.030
We all know that sodium is pretty light as a metal.

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.650
If you drop it onto water and forget the reaction, it floats.

4
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.810
<v 1>The orange sodium plane. Oh, it's on your camera.</v>

5
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:19.880
Oh, it is too.

6
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.150
<v 0>Of course. Lithium will do the same that there are differences,</v>

7
00:00:23.151 --> 00:00:24.500
which I'll show you in a minute.

8
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.090
But what I wanted to see was whether we could demonstrate how much

9
00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:32.240
lighter lithium was than sodium.

10
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.610
We'd never tried this experiment before,

11
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.950
but I asked Neil a technician to drop a piece of

12
00:00:39.951 --> 00:00:43.760
sodium and a piece of lithium of approximately the same size.

13
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.510
At the same time into beakers of hexane.

14
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.970
Hexane is similar to gasoline or petrol. And when you drop them,

15
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.960
it was really striking the sodium sank like a stone

16
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.950
because gasoline is much less dense than water,

17
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.140
but lithium bopped around like a little boat. If you look carefully,

18
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.030
they both started bubbling because we didn't use dry hexane

19
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.920
and both samples of hexane contain just a little bit of water that started

20
00:01:15.921 --> 00:01:16.580
reacting.

21
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.470
And of course that prompted Neil to want to drop the lumps

22
00:01:21.471 --> 00:01:23.450
of metal into real water.

23
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.620
So we tried the experiment again,

24
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.460
dropping lithium and sodium into water.

25
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.090
Of course, this time, both of them floated,

26
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.190
but lithium is less reactive towards water than sodium.

27
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.170
It's a smaller atom.

28
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.970
The electrons are more tightly held and the reaction is slower with the

29
00:01:49.971 --> 00:01:53.570
sodium. It was really quite surprising.

30
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.210
It went off with a real bang

31
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.780
And the beaker ended up in the back of the fume cupboard

32
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.480
And the sodium was gone and the lithium quietly bused around on the

33
00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:16.010
surface of the water. And when Neil encouraged it with a flame,

34
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.930
we got a beautiful red color, the characteristic flame color of lithium.

35
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.080
The other experiment,

36
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.020
what we tried was burning lithium in air and comparing

37
00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:31.760
it with burning lithium in nitrogen end to has the strongest

38
00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:36.230
bond between any two atoms the same sort in the

39
00:02:36.231 --> 00:02:37.190
periodic table.

40
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.200
So you need a lot of energy to break them apart because lithium is

41
00:02:42.201 --> 00:02:45.920
small. It can form very tight bonds with nitrogen.

42
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.380
And so I read frequently that lithium will burn in nitrogen.

43
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.240
So I persuaded you to set fire to some lithium and it

44
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.640
burned really brightly in air

45
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.680
and then poured liquid nitrogen into beaker to fill it up with

46
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:10.600
nitrogen CAS nitrogen boils at minus 200 degrees centigrade or minus

47
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:14.740
one 96. So the gas was pretty cold in the beaker.

48
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.240
And then he plunged the burning lithium into the beaker.

49
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.800
Now here, there was a difference of opinion between me and Neil.

50
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.650
I thought the reaction was a great success.

51
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.570
Neil was a bit disappointed because the lithium just glowed

52
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.200
red.

53
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.090
But what I saw was this is not a very big piece of metal being plunged into

54
00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:38.560
really cold gas.

55
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.940
And it kept on glowing red on and on and on.

56
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.680
Whereas if it had just been put out because it wasn't

57
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.280
reacting with nitrogen, it would have lost its color very quickly.

58
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.180
So I felt that it was a reasonable demonstration.

59
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.540
I've tried to do the same demonstration with magnesium,

60
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.700
which is also meant to burn in nitrogen.

61
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.230
I demonstrated it for 25 years to successive generations of

62
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:09.700
students and didn't work once I knew it wouldn't work,

63
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.860
but every time the students thought stupid professor doesn't work,

64
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.820
lithium is used for treating bipolar disorder,

65
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.200
sometimes called manic depression. This is a very distressing disease,

66
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.950
which is caused by imbalance of chemicals in the brain,

67
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.380
which causes people sometimes to be really manic and other times

68
00:04:32.381 --> 00:04:37.090
so depressed that they can't get out of bed. The application,

69
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.980
which you use probably most often for lithium is

70
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.860
in batteries. This is not a new idea.

71
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.720
I found an old scientific American from 1967

72
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.120
and inside there is an advertisement here with a

73
00:04:55.121 --> 00:04:58.030
picture of Edison's desk on his desk.

74
00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:01.600
When he died was a large can of lithium.

75
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.490
This is an advertisement from a company that sells lithium or so

76
00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:08.140
lithium in those days.

77
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.940
The reason that Edison had lithium on his desk was that he realized it

78
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.880
could potentially make really good batteries.

79
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.900
Is that the known reason or is that just what foot mineral company is

80
00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:22.720
suggesting? I think that's what they're suggesting.

81
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.500
And since he didn't make lithium batteries, perhaps we'll never know.

82
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.360
So there's one final and important application of lithium,

83
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.210
which is in making hydrogen bonds.

84
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.160
Let me just remind you that an atom bomb is formed

85
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.920
by atoms. Usually of uranium.

86
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.350
There could also be plutonium splitting apart. These are called the fish bone.

87
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.860
A hydrogen bomb is inherently different.

88
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.980
<v 2>The atomic energy commission and the department of defense have</v>

89
00:05:55.981 --> 00:05:57.560
conducted the important test.

90
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.870
<v 1>Of an experimental device based on the family nuclear principle.</v>

91
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.690
<v 0>Bits come together. So two atoms, for example,</v>

92
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.973
two deuterium.

93
00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.110
<v 1>But what is deuterium?</v>

94
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.850
I was coming to that and Adam of this kind of hydrogen has the simplest nucleus

95
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.680
known, but hydrogen exists in two other isotopic forms, deuterium,

96
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.550
which has a neutron in addition to the proton and tritium,

97
00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:26.350
which had two neutrons in one protein.

98
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.940
<v 0>Atoms of hydrogen with mass to Roatan mass one</v>

99
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.780
come together to form an atom of helium.

100
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.990
The first hydrogen bombs that were made,

101
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.030
and they really want to be called deuterium bombs, not hydrogen bombs involved,

102
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.340
liquid deuterium.

103
00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:51.040
And so the bomb really looked like a small chemical factory

104
00:06:51.041 --> 00:06:53.890
because they were big tanks of liquid deuterium.

105
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.750
And nobody could imagine carrying this on an airplane for

106
00:06:58.751 --> 00:06:59.710
actually bombing.

107
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.480
<v 1>This is the first small scale test of a hydrogen device. You have.</v>

108
00:07:04.481 --> 00:07:08.060
The reaction goes when the thermonuclear.

109
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.960
<v 0>The breakthrough came,</v>

110
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.790
when it was realized that you could use the compound of lithium

111
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.920
and deuterium. This is lithium deuteride L I D,

112
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.420
which is chemically the same as L I H. But with a heavier isotope,

113
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:39.520
what happens with that sort of bone is that you trigger it with an atom bomb

114
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:43.630
that produces a lot of neutrons and the

115
00:07:43.631 --> 00:07:48.190
neutrons turn some of the lithium atoms into tritium,

116
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:49.960
hydrogen and mass three,

117
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:54.850
and then the deuterium and the tritium fuse together, giving out energy,

118
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:58.660
let him do to ride is a solid, which is stable at room temperature.

119
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:03.730
In principle, you could make lithium tritium, right? L I T,

120
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:08.770
but tritium is highly radioactive and the K's away with a half-life of

121
00:08:08.771 --> 00:08:09.850
12 years.

122
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:15.100
So you have to keep on replacing your bombs so you could build

123
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.550
the bone without the huge containers of liquid,

124
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.730
and you could make something that was still pretty big,

125
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.610
but in principle could go in the times,

126
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:37.540
The first test of a lithium deuteride Boehm was carried out.

127
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.790
I think in 1954.

128
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:44.800
<v 1>We feel that the report of this important test should give the failures as well</v>

129
00:08:44.801 --> 00:08:45.820
as the successes.

130
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.700
<v 0>The test name was called castle Bravo.</v>

131
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.610
<v 1>The date was March one, 1954.</v>

132
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.310
This photograph was taken from an airplane that 50 miles,

133
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.790
the width of the fireball at this time,

134
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.720
about three seconds after detonation was four miles.

135
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.800
<v 0>It was really too successful.</v>

136
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:11.600
The power of the bond was three times bigger than it had been calculated.

137
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:17.300
<v 1>Amanda Shields resulted in a serious fall out situation at bikini and site.</v>

138
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.850
Another eight toes down Lynn from ground zero.

139
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:24.800
<v 0>The residents of the islands nearby had not been evacuated far</v>

140
00:09:24.801 --> 00:09:25.634
enough.

141
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:30.650
And several people were exposed to radiation in the

142
00:09:30.651 --> 00:09:35.030
most unfortunate manner, but the principle was demonstrated,

143
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:39.440
of course the whole technology is horrific,

144
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:43.280
but it's interesting to see how lithium played the part.

145
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.440
But to end on a much happier note, lithium is a light metal.

146
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:53.960
Hydrogen can be used to fuel cars using

147
00:09:53.961 --> 00:09:57.200
fuel cells that convert hydrogen to electricity.

148
00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:01.940
So now there is a lot of research to see whether lithium

149
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:07.130
hydride or a derivative of lithium hydrate can be used to store

150
00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.100
hydrogen in the tank of your car.

151
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.030
<v 3>Which sarin is one of them. Unfortunately,</v>

152
00:10:14.031 --> 00:10:18.620
terrorists can get hold of it. I've got a molecule of siren here.

153
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.540
Not real siren, not real, sorry. No,

154
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:26.120
that would be illegal to make that I've made it of, uh, strolls and, uh,

155
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.260
these colored balls there.
