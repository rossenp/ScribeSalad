00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.760
there are 117 more videos to watch

3
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.610
was that different.

4
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.540
<v 1>Helium is the second element on the periodic table. It makes up</v>

5
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.600
35% of our universe,

6
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.100
but it's very rare here on the planet earth. In fact,

7
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.570
it's the only element in the periodic table that was first

8
00:00:35.571 --> 00:00:38.600
discovered outside of planet.

9
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.670
The first indications of its existence came when people were

10
00:00:43.671 --> 00:00:46.820
looking at the spectrum of the sun in,

11
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.580
during the eclipse in 1868,

12
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.380
the year before Mandalay have proposed the periodic table and they noticed a

13
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.440
single very bright yellow line.

14
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.330
The yellow line is due to the electrons, helium,

15
00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:06.680
atom, being excited. You can do the same thing here on earth. In fact,

16
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.800
Neil has his own helium star.

17
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.310
This is a glass star filled with helium gas.

18
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.680
And if you apply very high voltage,

19
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.870
you can excite the electrons in the helium and it emits light.

20
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.000
And then with a small spectroscope,

21
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.340
you can look at it and see the very yellow line that was detected in the sun

22
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.940
spectrum to begin with. They thought it was sodium,

23
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.000
but then they realized it must be a new element.

24
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.070
And because it was found on the sun,

25
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.480
it was given the name helium from the Greek word Helios,

26
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.003
which is,

27
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.780
I believe what the sun is called in Greek or the God of the sun is called.

28
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.420
It was then discovered on earth.

29
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.340
At the beginning of the 20th century with people were examining a

30
00:01:55.341 --> 00:01:59.690
uranium mineral called I think CLI Vite.

31
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.970
Then a few years later,

32
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.010
fairly rapidly helium gas was discovered as a

33
00:02:07.011 --> 00:02:10.970
component of natural gas coming out of gas fields in the

34
00:02:10.971 --> 00:02:12.230
United States.

35
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.910
The reason why you find helium associated with uranium,

36
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.990
and in fact,

37
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.640
other radioactive materials is because the

38
00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:27.140
nucleus of helium contains two neutrons and two

39
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.280
protons.

40
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.770
And the naked nucleus of helium is water called alpha

41
00:02:33.771 --> 00:02:37.850
particles that are emitted during radioactive decay.

42
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.790
So if a radioactive atom,

43
00:02:40.791 --> 00:02:45.230
decays and emits an alpha particle underground,

44
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.180
the alpha particle quickly picks up a couple of electrons and

45
00:02:50.181 --> 00:02:54.170
becomes an item of helium. And over millions of years,

46
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.190
this can accumulate in gas field. As far as I'm aware,

47
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.520
all of the helium in the world has come from radioactive decay

48
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.440
apart from a small amount that has come from people letting of

49
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.580
hydrogen bomb.

50
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.210
<v 2>The width of the fireball at this time,</v>

51
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.110
about three seconds after that nation was four miles.

52
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.360
<v 1>Helium in the natural gas was discovered fairly shortly</v>

53
00:03:21.361 --> 00:03:23.460
before the first world war.

54
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.100
And so it was quickly realized that this gas could be useful

55
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.170
for observation balloons on the Western front, on the battlefields.

56
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.840
<v 3>The enemy troop movements and defense schemes are under constant observation by</v>

57
00:03:39.841 --> 00:03:42.570
French and British airman, as well as by observation balloons.

58
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.010
<v 1>Because unlike hydrogen, it doesn't burn.</v>

59
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.930
So if a bullet goes through your balloon, it doesn't immediately blow up.

60
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.850
So helium started to be produced as a strategic material.

61
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.170
<v 3>Non-expensive gas for the originals and Medica has a virtual monopoly of it</v>

62
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.800
healing.

63
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.630
<v 1>So there's a long history in the United States of legislation for conserving</v>

64
00:04:06.631 --> 00:04:10.050
helium for strategic defense purposes.

65
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.590
<v 3>It has of course attracted great attention all over the world because of the</v>

66
00:04:13.591 --> 00:04:14.940
terrible Hindenburg disaster.

67
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.450
The American president's cabinet committee is convinced that helium should not

68
00:04:18.451 --> 00:04:21.060
be made available to Germany, but you will send commercial ashes.

69
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.800
<v 1>So helium,</v>

70
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.630
nucleus or helium atom weighs four times as much as a

71
00:04:27.631 --> 00:04:30.540
hydrogen atom, which has just one proton,

72
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.610
but because hydrogen exists as an H two molecule

73
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.440
helium atom,

74
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.390
which is the same as its molecule weighs twice as much as a hydrogen

75
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.280
molecule and Neil,

76
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.990
our colleague has divided quite a nice little demonstration.

77
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.820
<v 2>So.</v>

78
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.280
<v 1>Well, yeah,</v>

79
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.170
he has a balloon of hydrogen and the balloon of helium of about

80
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.150
the same size and shows that the hydrogen balloon

81
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.680
with a suitable police system can actually pull the helium

82
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.540
balloon downwards because it there's a lot more lift in a

83
00:05:12.541 --> 00:05:16.950
hydrogen balloon than in the helium one, because the hydrogen is lighter.

84
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.110
The most important property for helium nowadays is the fact

85
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.150
that when you liquefy it,

86
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.760
it forms the coldest liquid that one can

87
00:05:29.761 --> 00:05:30.594
obtain

88
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.700
liquid helium boils at minus 269

89
00:05:41.701 --> 00:05:43.530
degrees centigrade.

90
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.790
That is four degrees above absolute zero.

91
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.860
So you can use liquid helium to cool materials

92
00:05:52.861 --> 00:05:53.694
down.

93
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.580
And particularly you can cool certain alloys of

94
00:05:58.581 --> 00:05:59.414
metals,

95
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.580
which lose all their electrical resistance at low temperature so-called

96
00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:05.840
superconductors,

97
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.860
which can be used to build really powerful magnets,

98
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.870
particularly for our university for magnetic resonance imaging

99
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.850
for looking inside people's bodies to see that all is well,

100
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.640
and you need a very high magnetic field.

101
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.050
And so our university has a plant for

102
00:06:27.051 --> 00:06:29.210
liquefying helium and Brady,

103
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:32.150
and I were able to go and visit it.

104
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.800
We were shown how the liquid helium is filled into

105
00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:40.430
large thermos flowers. So-called Dewar flasks.

106
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.210
When you want to prompt the helium out remarkably,

107
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.320
you use the inside of a rugby football.

108
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.210
This is the bladder inside it.

109
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:55.550
A rugby football is quite similar to an American football and you,

110
00:06:55.551 --> 00:07:00.500
by squeezing this, you can pressurize the helium and get it to come out.

111
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.940
And if you do it wrong, it blows up to a large size the bladder.

112
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.370
And we were shown what's happened. I was a bit frightened. It might impact.

113
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:17.240
We were then shown what happens when you squirt liquid helium into air.

114
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.150
And it's really strange because as the liquid comes out,

115
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.080
the jet of liquid looks very like a flavor.

116
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:37.900
The shape is almost the same though. Of course, it's whitish in color.

117
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:43.510
Neil had given us a small metal stainless steel thermals

118
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.640
can, it's very important.

119
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.020
It's stainless steel because helium can go through

120
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:55.060
gloves. So if you use a glass thermals, as soon as you put helium into it,

121
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.670
it stops being a thermos vessel.

122
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:02.920
Neil wanted just to try and see if we could fill this kind with liquid helium.

123
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.100
So we could actually show you what the liquid looked like.

124
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:13.990
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

125
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:18.250
<v 1>We had the number of attempts and the most spectacular</v>

126
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.700
eruptions of cold helium vapor.

127
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:26.740
The problem is that helium vapor that comes off is so cold,

128
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:32.980
not totally freezes on the water vapor in the air. So you get the fog,

129
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:38.260
but it can also liquefy the oxygen or nitrogen in the

130
00:08:38.261 --> 00:08:39.094
air.

131
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:43.750
So even though we pre-cool the Thermo's with liquid

132
00:08:43.751 --> 00:08:47.110
nitrogen, so we started at a fairly low temperature.

133
00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:50.830
It was quite difficult to get the liquid in.

134
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.020
And once we got it in,

135
00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:58.140
there was so much folk that it was quite difficult to tell whether we were

136
00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:02.760
really seeing the surface of the liquid or not, but it was great fun,

137
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.640
Breeds, DNA really enjoyed ourselves.

138
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.120
And the technician Sanjeev was really helpful.

139
00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:21.470
He even tried filling a much bigger vessel with Nick

140
00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.990
and pouring it into our thermals.

141
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:35.030
<v 0>Yes.</v>

142
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.780
<v 1>When people use liquid helium, seriously, for example,</v>

143
00:09:38.781 --> 00:09:40.910
for magnetic resonance imaging,

144
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.790
because the gas is expensive,

145
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.660
it is piped back to the liquefaction plant.

146
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.460
So it can be recycled.

147
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:54.140
And you've all seen little helium balloons that people use at parties and the

148
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:57.560
Lake, but at the liquefaction plant,

149
00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.800
they have an enormous yellow balloon,

150
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:05.810
which they use for storing the gas before it's liquified.

151
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:10.850
And they have gas meters to measure the volume of gas coming back so

152
00:10:10.851 --> 00:10:15.230
that they knew how much gas has been lost and how much they have to

153
00:10:15.231 --> 00:10:18.770
charge each customer for the guests that they've lost.

154
00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.190
I used to work with liquid Tealium long time ago,

155
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.940
and I still have the very old gas meter that we used,

156
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:29.780
which is just over there on the filing cabinet.

157
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.140
<v 4>Thanks for watching this video.</v>

158
00:10:33.141 --> 00:10:36.770
We actually filmed a lot more stuff about helium that we haven't fit into this

159
00:10:36.771 --> 00:10:40.370
one, but we're going to upload another helium video very soon.

160
00:10:40.371 --> 00:10:41.750
So you can see all that stuff.

161
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:45.320
You can also watch our videos about all the different elements we've done all

162
00:10:45.321 --> 00:10:47.810
118. Some of them numerous times,

163
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:51.020
there's a link to a playlist of those videos. Also,

164
00:10:51.021 --> 00:10:53.510
we've obviously done hundreds of other chemistry videos.

165
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.010
And if you'd like to support us,

166
00:10:55.011 --> 00:10:59.840
you can go to patrion.com/periodic videos and find out more

167
00:10:59.841 --> 00:11:03.080
there, including our little gimmick, where you can adopt an element,

168
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.160
including helium.
