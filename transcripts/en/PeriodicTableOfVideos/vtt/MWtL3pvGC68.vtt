00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.120
<v 0>Cobalt is element number 27,</v>

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.170
between iron 26 and nickel 28.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.000
And like most elements. It's really quite interesting. It is a catalyst.

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.090
It can be used in magnets.

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.460
It is important in the batteries that we have in all our modern electronic

6
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.230
equipment and above all it is associated with the color blue,

7
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.190
the element where it's compounds has been known for a long time,

8
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.400
because it's been used for coloring glass.

9
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.780
I've found in my cupboard at home,

10
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.840
quite a nice glass jar,

11
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.090
which everybody has told me is a 19th century Christmas tree

12
00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:47.520
light with a candle in it though.

13
00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:51.180
I'm sure some viewers will tell me it's something more boring,

14
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.190
but I still think it's a Christmas tree light and you can see it has got this

15
00:00:56.191 --> 00:00:59.520
glorious blue color. Did you buy it in the 19th century?

16
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.100
Um, I can't remember when I bought it, but it was a long time ago.

17
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.140
They add a small amount of cobalt into the melt when they're making the

18
00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:14.460
glass. And so you get isolated irons of cobalt,

19
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.230
which have this nice blue color cobalt itself is a shiny

20
00:01:19.231 --> 00:01:23.490
metal. If it's polished and it's relatively dense,

21
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.960
it's quite heavy to hold.

22
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.280
It's used principally in alloys with other metals.

23
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.180
It used to be used a lot making magnets there.

24
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:37.410
Now you can get more powerful magnets using rare earth

25
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.340
because cobalt is a so-called transition metal.

26
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.010
The irons of cobalt say cobalt two plus that's cobalt with two

27
00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:51.840
electrons removed. It's usually not naked.

28
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.880
It will be coordinated by other compounds.

29
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.140
For example, if you make it using water,

30
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.090
you get six water molecules round the cobalt.

31
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.470
So here you can see cobalt in the middle with six water

32
00:02:10.471 --> 00:02:12.090
molecules round it.

33
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.780
Now you might ask how can you form so many bonds?

34
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.850
And the answer is that the interaction is partly electrostatic,

35
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.930
the negative oxygen interacting with the positive

36
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
cobalt. If you heat cobalt, chloride,

37
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.070
which has beautiful red colored crystals to high temperature,

38
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.300
you can drive off the water and make a sort of purplish palette.

39
00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.593
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

40
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.660
<v 0>We found a lovely,</v>

41
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.070
really old sample of anhydrous without water

42
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.140
cobalt chloride in a bottle that's still sealed up with its original

43
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.890
wrapping.

44
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.240
We felt we really didn't have the heart to destroy this historic sample to

45
00:03:33.241 --> 00:03:36.480
destroy the wrapping. So you'll have to look at it through the glass.

46
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.840
We had another sample of anhydrous Cobell chloride,

47
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.670
where the bottle had split.

48
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.960
So air and water could get in and you can see it goes back to the pinkish color.

49
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.330
So we've got two demonstrations for you.

50
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.110
The first one is to demonstrate how in solution,

51
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.820
you can remove the water and substitute it with chloride diamonds by using

52
00:03:56.821 --> 00:04:01.290
concentrated hydrochloric acid. We were so excited to do this,

53
00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:03.540
that the first time we didn't do it very well.

54
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.380
We had to test tube of cobalt chloride solution.

55
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.240
You're nice to pinkish color and try dropping in concentrated hydrochloric

56
00:04:12.241 --> 00:04:16.740
acid. But although you could see some changes of color,

57
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.380
the concentration of the acid was not.

58
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.040
So we reversed it and dropped the pink

59
00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:32.040
solution into the colorless hydrochloric acid.

60
00:04:32.041 --> 00:04:36.660
So now we had a whole test tube with hydrochloric acid and what we

61
00:04:36.661 --> 00:04:37.230
saw,

62
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.700
and I hope you can is that as the pink solution goes in,

63
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.200
it goes bright blue.

64
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.940
And the bright blue is color is due to cobalt

65
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.330
irons with full chlorides irons.

66
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.190
So it goes to cobalt cl four to minus going

67
00:04:56.191 --> 00:04:59.280
from cobalt to plus two minus science.

68
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.770
And the striking thing is of course, that it's a much darker color,

69
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.840
even though we're diluting it. If you drop the cobalt chloride into water,

70
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.170
you see almost no color because it's so dilute.

71
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.360
So the reason why you get this very intense color is because

72
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.280
of the change of the shape of the atoms immediately around the

73
00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:27.690
cobalt, going from six, ran the cobalt to only four.

74
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.990
And this change of shape changes.

75
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.490
The quantum mechanical rules in which the electrons are

76
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.923
interact with light.

77
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.610
<v 1>[Inaudible] in the second experiment.</v>

78
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.650
<v 0>I want you to see what happens if you drop cobalt chloride solution</v>

79
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.580
into sodium hydroxide, quite concentrated,

80
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.380
and you would expect to see a precipitate of cobalt hydroxide,

81
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.040
which is pink. Now watch carefully as it comes in,

82
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.460
you get to precipitate a solid, but it's bright blue.

83
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:25.240
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

84
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.620
<v 0>And then as you watch really quite slowly and</v>

85
00:06:29.621 --> 00:06:34.570
satisfyingly it's gradually goes pink to

86
00:06:34.571 --> 00:06:36.460
make the product that you expect.

87
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.830
So this is an example of a reaction where the starting material

88
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.750
goes through some sort of intermediate compounds and then makes the product

89
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.200
and it makes the intermediate very quickly.

90
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.770
And then slowly it goes to the product.

91
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.920
And what's happening is that, first of all,

92
00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.300
you get a mixed salt where you have both hydroxide and chloride,

93
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.130
which is still in soluble.

94
00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:07.000
So it precipitates and then slowly,

95
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.050
and it's slow because it's in the solid state and has to read, dissolve.

96
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:16.300
The chloride is replaced by hydroxide to give you the pink color.

97
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.470
And it's really quite mesmerizing how these pink crystals,

98
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:25.870
rain down cobalt is also very important as a catalyst.

99
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.800
It is used in a variety of industrial processes,

100
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.960
particularly a process for converting natural gas or rather

101
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.860
a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen,

102
00:07:38.861 --> 00:07:43.450
which can be made from natural gas and has the rather amusing name of CIN

103
00:07:43.451 --> 00:07:48.160
gas for synths gas and using a cobalt catalyst.

104
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:53.050
You can then convert it to liquid fuels for cars or lorries

105
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:58.360
and the advantages that you can take. Isolated gas fields, where there's,

106
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:00.670
um, natural gas, methane,

107
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.300
and converted into liquid fuel that can then be transported.

108
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.470
Cobalt is also very toxic.

109
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:13.630
We had some powdered cobalt so-called cobalt, sponge, and Neil.

110
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.530
Our technician was really quite nervous of this poisonous powder,

111
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.060
but cobalt is also vital for life.

112
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.660
It occurs in a molecule called vitamin B12,

113
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:31.330
which is present in living organisms and rather low concentration,

114
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:36.310
but catalyzes a whole series of important biological reactions and the

115
00:08:36.311 --> 00:08:41.110
structure of vitamin B12 was determined by the British chemistry,

116
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.400
Dorothy Hodgkin,

117
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:47.590
who was the only woman who's won the Nobel prize for chemistry

118
00:08:47.591 --> 00:08:48.610
from the UK.

119
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:52.900
So it is really a very historic structure.

120
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.630
<v 3>This is Neil's new device. It's a very, very fancy erection. Essentially.</v>

121
00:09:02.631 --> 00:09:07.250
We've used a laboratory stand and we have an islet.

122
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:12.500
So this is just to act as a point where which we can raise up our

123
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:13.880
cesium on a piece of string.
