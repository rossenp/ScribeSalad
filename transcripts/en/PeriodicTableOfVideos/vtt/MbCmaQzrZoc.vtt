00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.180
<v 0>Vanadium element number 23, the third,</v>

2
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.250
the so-called transition metal.

3
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.080
So it lies between titanium and chromium in the periodic

4
00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:28.800
table. I don't know a huge amount about the chemistry of vanadium.

5
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.690
I've never actually seen vanadium metal. So let's have a look at it.

6
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.400
It's in a really quite historic box. It's wire. It's not things between,

7
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.400
and you can see there's a coil of fairly Blackish

8
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.030
colored wire. There's several things that interest me. First of all,

9
00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:51.480
that you can make wire as thin as that. And secondly,

10
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.690
that it doesn't look very shiny. Possibly.

11
00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:57.030
It's got an oxide layer on the surface.

12
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.170
I've been given another sample of the native powder,

13
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.220
but for Navien powder can catch fire quite easily.

14
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.630
And so I don't really want to take it out because we might have a fight here on

15
00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:11.040
the table. In my office,

16
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.360
vanadium metal is quite light and it is used in a variety of

17
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.650
alloys. It is also like many of the transition metals.

18
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.720
You can have different so-called oxidation states with different

19
00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:29.610
numbers of electrons around the vanadium atom.

20
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.610
Now there's a really nice demonstration,

21
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.890
which you should watch carefully because it's what our first year students do.

22
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.870
So if you come to this university and several others, if you know this,

23
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.960
you'll get better marks in your practical, Darren,

24
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.740
my colleague really enjoys doing this reaction.

25
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.550
<v 1>Vanadium five.</v>

26
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.410
It's a yellow solution of ammonia Mehta validate. As you can see,

27
00:01:57.411 --> 00:01:58.580
it's a nice yellow color.

28
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.440
And what are the really nice things about the various oxidation states of

29
00:02:03.441 --> 00:02:06.080
vanadium is that there are different colors.

30
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.770
So what we have here is we have a metal amalgam,

31
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.210
and this is mercury. As you can see, we have mercury with some zinc in it.

32
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.770
The really nice thing about this amalgam is that we can convince some

33
00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:23.630
electrons to jump from this metal amalgam onto some

34
00:02:23.631 --> 00:02:27.020
other species. So remember our vanadium five,

35
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.210
and I'm going to put in here a glug of vanadium five.

36
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.300
That's not a scientific quantity. That's, that's, that's, uh, a glorious,

37
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.530
it's a good book.

38
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.070
The vanadium solution is sitting on top of the Mercury's zinc amalgam.

39
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.310
And hopefully, what am I going to do is by shaking it up,

40
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.290
I'm going to convince some electrons in the metal to jump onto the vanadium

41
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.393
species,

42
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.330
changing the oxidation state of the vignette of the vanadium as I do it,

43
00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.250
hopefully we'll see a color change. Can you see the yellow? Yeah. All right.

44
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:01.480
So let's see.

45
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.140
So now a nice blue color, right?

46
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.850
And the blue color I happened to now is vanadium for right?

47
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:20.830
So each of the vanadium species has gained one electron changing toxic oxidation

48
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:23.920
state. It has been reduced. So if I shake it a bit more, I'm going to see,

49
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:27.670
can we convince more of the metal to give up electrons? Right.

50
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.710
So I think we're looking for

51
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.330
a nice green color

52
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.880
and you can see I've got a kind of a green color there.

53
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:43.930
Can you see that as green? We've gone from vanadium five to four to three.

54
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.950
Okay. So now I need to shake it up a lot to see.

55
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:51.520
Can I convince another electron to go and access vanadium too?

56
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.480
So let's see. This is for the mercury is so heavy.

57
00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.310
This is slightly hard work. So there we go.

58
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.830
Purple vanadium two.

59
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:09.550
So we've gone a vanadium 5, 4,

60
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.230
3 to four different oxidation states of an alien resulting in the really nice

61
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:17.350
purple vanadium two species.

62
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.530
And then what would happen is if we put that on the bench

63
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.170
and left the lid off oxygen can,

64
00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:28.720
obviously the air can get into that container.

65
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.260
And what will happen is we will oxidize this solution again.

66
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.080
So if we waited for long enough, we would see the colors go room.

67
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.160
<v 0>You can find for native in nature.</v>

68
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.070
There are mushrooms,

69
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.410
the sort of red ones with white spots that fairies and elves sit on

70
00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:50.550
in fairy tales and never know the difference between mushrooms and

71
00:04:50.551 --> 00:04:51.480
toadstools,

72
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.130
the things that grow in forests and in this mushroom,

73
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.330
what may be toadstool,

74
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.830
nobody's quite sure way there are for native compounds.

75
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.200
One idea is that just might be a poison to discourage people from eating it

76
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.800
or not people, but animals, slugs worms.

77
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.320
The other theory is that the vanadium may react

78
00:05:16.321 --> 00:05:18.000
with hydrogen peroxide,

79
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.100
which can sometimes be formed in by chemical processes and which

80
00:05:23.101 --> 00:05:27.900
would otherwise attack more important molecules to the life of the

81
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.550
mushroom or toadstool.

82
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.430
But I think it's really quite interesting that a mushroom or

83
00:05:35.431 --> 00:05:39.060
a toadstool can do good vanadium chemistry

84
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.170
to blow up balloons of hydrogen.

85
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.450
And the thing that's always puzzled me is that when they blow up the

86
00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:56.070
flame has a reddish color and it's, well-known that hydrogen,

87
00:05:56.071 --> 00:05:57.900
when it burns, for example,

88
00:05:57.901 --> 00:06:02.040
in a Bunsen burner or something like that gives an almost colorless.
