00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.110
<v 0>Neil. And I have come up with a couple of ways of showing you a transparent</v>

2
00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:10.770
gas in a rather more interesting way. First of all,

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.540
like all gases are gone, can be liquified.

4
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.930
It has a melting point and a boiling point.

5
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.430
Both of them slightly higher than the temperature of liquid nitrogen.

6
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.960
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

7
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.130
<v 0>They're quite unusual because there's barely five degrees</v>

8
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.850
centigrade between the melting point and the boiling point.

9
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.060
Most liquids have quite a long liquid range.

10
00:00:41.061 --> 00:00:44.420
You can hit them quite a bit after they've melted,

11
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.470
before they boil argon has this tiny range.

12
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:49.730
But Neil,

13
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.290
with his magic experimental fingers has managed to liquefy it

14
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.770
really quite simply in the same way that we make liquid oxygen by

15
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.370
bypassing argon gas through a coil that is cooled with liquid nitrogen,

16
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.500
The algorithm passes through the coil faster than it can freeze.

17
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.300
And you can collect the liquid in the Thermo's flowers. Do you have a vessel?

18
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.460
As you know, we have a special deal vessel. That's not silver,

19
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.920
so you can see what's inside for easily.

20
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.320
And you can see our gone boils as a colorless liquid looks

21
00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:46.880
rather like nitrogen, but if you measured the temperature,

22
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.180
you'd find it was boiling it a slightly high temperature.

23
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.120
I get quite excited saying liquid the Hong Kong,

24
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.710
partly because I've never actually seen it before in the Dewar,

25
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.110
but also because we used to do research using liquid argon

26
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.070
as a solvent.

27
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.580
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

28
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.150
<v 0>And in fact, I've got the sale we used to use here.</v>

29
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.920
The sales made out of copper and it's cooled with liquid nitrogen that goes

30
00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:36.230
through one of these pipes. And now to the other,

31
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.910
there's a little chamber inside with windows that are transparent to

32
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.480
infrared light. The windows themselves are quite exciting.

33
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.750
Let me show you if I shine my food and through it,

34
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.810
you can see that the windows are red and they're red because they made a

35
00:02:52.811 --> 00:02:57.690
very compound of thallium and broom in an IRD.

36
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.660
And it has the rather name of KRS five.

37
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.060
And because thallium is very poisonous,

38
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.620
you mustn't touch it and you'd spoil the experiments. Anyway, if you touched it,

39
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.360
the reason we were using liquid argon as a solvent is because we were doing

40
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.800
infrared spectroscopy and looking at the spectrum of dissolved

41
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:18.730
molecules.

42
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.370
Infrared light is absorbed by the vibration of atoms,

43
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.570
but argon has only one atom in the molecule.

44
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.340
So it can't vibrate. So it is completely transparent.

45
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:38.080
Infrared light, unlike nearly every other solvent motor,

46
00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:41.050
for example, absorbs infrared light very strongly.

47
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.400
So you can have a very dilute solution in liquid argon,

48
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.470
and you can get a wonderful spectrum because it doesn't absorb.

49
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.270
And because it's cold,

50
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.520
you can see the behavior molecules in solution at much lower temperature than

51
00:03:57.521 --> 00:04:00.040
in most other solvents are gone,

52
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.120
is used in the lab as just an inert gas.

53
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.770
When you're handling compounds that react with oxygen.

54
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.610
If you are looking at not very valuable compounds,

55
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.650
you very often will use nitrogen because nitrogen is much cheaper than argon,

56
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.700
but because they add some of argon is much heavier than the molecule of

57
00:04:21.701 --> 00:04:22.534
nitrogen.

58
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.340
It's much more efficient in chasing air out of the remote corners of your

59
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:32.320
operators. So for really, as sensitive compounds are gone is better.

60
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.700
In the 18th century,

61
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.320
there was some indication when people were analyzing air that there was an extra

62
00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:43.270
1% that was no nitrogen, but they had no means of identifying it.

63
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.190
And it was only in the 1890s that load Riley

64
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.960
and Ramsey first managed to identify all gone,

65
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.760
particularly by putting electric current through the gas and

66
00:04:57.761 --> 00:05:02.560
observing the light that is emitted Neal has got out one of our

67
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.220
Nobel guest stars. This time filled with all guns.

68
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.740
And when you put a current through it,

69
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.760
you can see it gives out a very nice blue color,

70
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.670
quite different from the orange of helium or the right of neon.

71
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.840
And the light consists of a number of lines, different colors,

72
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.830
which is essentially what was observed at the end of the 19th century.

73
00:05:26.831 --> 00:05:28.660
When argon was identified,

74
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.840
the name argon apparently comes from the Greek word,

75
00:05:31.841 --> 00:05:36.130
meaning idle because it doesn't react with other things,

76
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.900
but even that's not correct now because there are a

77
00:05:40.901 --> 00:05:45.310
whole series of experiments that have been done looking at the reaction to

78
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.320
valgum at low temperature.

79
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.540
And if you condense all gone and hydrogen fluoride HF

80
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.070
at 20 degrees,

81
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.060
absolute and shine light on them to dissociate the HF,

82
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.770
you can make a molecule, which is hydrogen argon, fluorine.

83
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.230
It's only stable at very low temperature,

84
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.240
but there was huge excitement when it was discovered because it was the first

85
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:13.040
compound of outcome. Well,

86
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:17.930
it wasn't quite the first compound because early on in

87
00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:20.450
my career, my fellow student,

88
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.700
Robin Perutz was studying the reactions of a chromium compound

89
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.850
in solid argon at 20 degrees.

90
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.830
Absolute the molecules were isolated a bit like the cherries in a

91
00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:37.940
cake. And when you shine light on the chromium compounds,

92
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.800
they dissociated and the chromium atom could react or

93
00:06:42.801 --> 00:06:47.330
interact with are gone. Now, it wasn't a very strong bond,

94
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.240
but it was enough to change the color of the compound.

95
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.030
And it made a beautiful purple color,

96
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.740
which I photographed and have used as a slide ever since the

97
00:06:57.741 --> 00:06:58.574
final.

98
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.350
And I have to admit perhaps slightly boring application of argon

99
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.570
is in double glazing to keep our houses warm because argon

100
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.670
has a heavy atom.

101
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.970
The atoms don't move very fast in the gas phase and therefore they're

102
00:07:16.971 --> 00:07:20.960
bad conducting heat. So if you have double glazing,

103
00:07:20.961 --> 00:07:24.140
that's two sheets of glass in your window.

104
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.020
If you put out in between the glass,

105
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:31.700
it is much more effective and insulating the

106
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.670
inside of the house, keeping cold out.

107
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.700
Then if you use air,

108
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.820
because air has a much higher conductivity of heat.

109
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.360
So if you look out to the window,

110
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:47.930
you may find that you're looking through argon gas.

111
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:06.340
