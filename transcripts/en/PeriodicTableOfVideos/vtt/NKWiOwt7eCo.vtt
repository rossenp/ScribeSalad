00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.910
<v 0>Well, that gas might come out.</v>

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.470
So when you poke the mud at the bottom,

3
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.130
bubbles of gas, come out in principle,

4
00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:18.780
this contains a trace of phosphene, but you won't be able to see any fostering,

5
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.130
but what it's not often the professor doesn't experiment

6
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.750
very recently papers been published that has caused huge

7
00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:33.410
excitements. Astronomers have detected the gas.

8
00:00:33.411 --> 00:00:37.550
Phosphine pH three on the planet, Venus,

9
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.710
but what's really caused excitement is that they've said this could

10
00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:46.700
be the sign of life on the planet,

11
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.730
which is really surprising because up till now,

12
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.690
people have thought Venus is really hot and unpleasant.

13
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.000
So life couldn't possibly exist.

14
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.970
Phosphine molecule pH three is as Brady likes to say

15
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.080
the older brother of ammonia NH three,

16
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.940
because phosphorus is underneath nitrogen on the periodic table.

17
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.510
So I am at home. I don't have all my molecular models.

18
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.890
You've got to imagine this black Pitt is a pair of

19
00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:23.810
electrons and the molecule has phosphorous with three

20
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.920
hydrogen atoms round it in the actual molecule.

21
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.760
These hydrogen atoms are a bit further down.

22
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.220
There are two ways of making phosphene.

23
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.020
You can make it by reacting a metal phosphite that's a

24
00:01:39.021 --> 00:01:43.910
compound of a metal, say zinc or aluminum and phosphorous.

25
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.680
And if you react it with this with acid, phosphene bubbles out.

26
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.240
Usually it comes out slightly impure mixed with a

27
00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:55.910
molecule P two H four,

28
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.870
and this P two H four has a strong smell of garlic.

29
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.640
It also has the property that if it's exposed to oxygen in the air,

30
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.370
it's immediately burst into flames.

31
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.170
But pH three itself does not catch fire and

32
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.500
can exist for quite a long time in the atmosphere.

33
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.960
Until I read the paper about Venus,

34
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.000
I didn't realize that phosphene is also present in the Earth's atmosphere.

35
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.000
Phosphene is really quite poisonous,

36
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.450
but it's at such low concentrations in the atmosphere.

37
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.250
It can't possibly harm you phosphene is at a very, very low level.

38
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.160
Phosphine on earth comes largely from decomposition of plant

39
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.310
matter in the mud at the bottom of poems,

40
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.200
the bacteria turn the phosphorus, which is found, for example,

41
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.430
in the DNA of the plant material,

42
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.370
DNA contains a lot of phosphate.

43
00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.790
This is turned into phosphine phosphine is free to soluble in water,

44
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.320
so it can bubble out together with the Marsh gas,

45
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.490
the methane that is the major product of these bacteria.

46
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.620
There is actually a story, which I'm not sure is true,

47
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:16.390
but is sounds fun.

48
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.730
Which is that in the old days, by old days, I mean seven,

49
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.481
800,

50
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:27.100
900 years ago when there was no street lighting and

51
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:30.100
people were walking through marshy areas,

52
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.520
they sometimes saw strange lights,

53
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.870
which in English called Willow the wisp, these strange lights,

54
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.340
they thought were houses.

55
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.370
And therefore they walked into the Marsh and were drowned.

56
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.310
And the suggestion is that perhaps it was phosphine coming out with its

57
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.300
impurity, with the Marsh gas and setting the meat thing on fire.

58
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.220
But this may be complete rubbish.

59
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.660
Industrially phosphene is made by reacting white

60
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.190
phosphorous. You will have seen our video on white phosphorus with peat,

61
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.440
burning it to produce huge amount of light white phosphorous can

62
00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:13.090
react with alkali and produce phosphine phosphine is used

63
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:16.270
industrially for two major applications.

64
00:04:16.271 --> 00:04:18.640
One in the electronics industry.

65
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.830
The other use is fumigating clothes to kill parasites.

66
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.710
Let's get back to Venus the first point,

67
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.750
which was a real surprise to me that Venus is not the first planet

68
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.170
that pH three phosphine has been discovered on.

69
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.030
There's very good data for phosphine being discovered on Jupiter and

70
00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:40.810
Saturn,

71
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.220
where the Cassini space probe used the

72
00:04:45.221 --> 00:04:49.930
absorption of infrared light to detect phosphene in the atmosphere.

73
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.850
How did they discover it on Venus? Because they weren't using a space probe.

74
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.680
They were using telescopes here on earth and the way that they discovered it

75
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.380
was due to the absorption of light.

76
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.090
When the molecules rotate now,

77
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.950
a molecule like phosphene can rotate round

78
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.010
and round. And when it rotates,

79
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.830
it can absorb energy and rotate faster.

80
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.660
And the absorptions due to the rotation,

81
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.630
give rise to many them,

82
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.830
many lines in the spectrum at very long wave light,

83
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.760
almost in the microwave region, millimeter wavelengths.

84
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.240
There are a lot of these absorptions and they have varied sharp,

85
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.650
which means that even if you have all sorts of absorptions due to other

86
00:05:40.651 --> 00:05:45.240
molecules, there will be a gap where you can see the absorption of phosphene.

87
00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:46.050
If it's there.

88
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.000
I should say this model is difficult to rotate because it squeaks

89
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.230
the Earth's atmosphere absorbs a lot of this radiation.

90
00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.410
So you can only record the using a telescope that is very

91
00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:01.940
high in altitude.

92
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:06.230
So there isn't much air above it between you and Venus.

93
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.150
And one of the key pieces of evidence was they sort of got the same result

94
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.640
from different telescopes,

95
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.740
which meant there wasn't a factory nearby releasing phosphine into the air.

96
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.960
If phosphenes already been observed on Saturn and Jupiter,

97
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.530
why aren't people saying there's life on Saturn and Jupiter,

98
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.240
but there might be on Venus.

99
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.800
And the reason is using modeling of atmospheric chemistry.

100
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.040
You can produce a good mechanism,

101
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.020
how phosphene could arise in Saturn and

102
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.870
Jupiter. The problem with Venus,

103
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.400
which has a very dense atmosphere with a lot of carbon dioxide,

104
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.700
not very much hydrogen, it's difficult,

105
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.110
if not impossible for the authors to construct a model that would

106
00:06:57.111 --> 00:06:59.870
explain why the phosphene was there.

107
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.400
The problem is that once the phosphene is formed,

108
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.610
it will drift up in the atmosphere.

109
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.380
And Venus you ought to know is close to the sun.

110
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.570
So there is a lot of UV light from the sun that can quickly destroy

111
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.470
the phosphene.

112
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.090
So there must be something that is generating this phosphene

113
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:27.410
continuously to match the rate at which it's being destroyed.

114
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.840
The authors write in their paper,

115
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.900
that they can't think of another mechanism,

116
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:37.790
and it could be due to some form of life in their

117
00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:38.624
favor.

118
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:43.460
The bacteria in the bottom of poems are anaerobic

119
00:07:43.461 --> 00:07:46.880
bacteria that they operate in the absence of oxygen.

120
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.500
And there is no or very little free oxygen on Venus.

121
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:56.270
We don't really understand entirely how the bacteria

122
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.120
make this material on earth.

123
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.670
So one would have to go into considerable speculation to

124
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:08.150
work out what might make it on Venus.

125
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.830
They may be right,

126
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:14.840
but it's important to be quite skeptical and think they

127
00:08:14.841 --> 00:08:19.430
could be some different explanation. I'm not an atmospheric chemist.

128
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:21.680
So I'm not going to tell, you know,

129
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:25.400
some brilliant explanation because I don't know who won,

130
00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:30.740
but I know enough about chemistry to reserve my judgment

131
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:36.230
and say, they wouldn't be surprised if quite soon as somebody comes up with an

132
00:08:36.231 --> 00:08:37.790
alternative explanation,

133
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:43.610
of course it would be thrilling if they were right. And there is life on Venus,

134
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:48.020
but they really strange life because it will be floating in the

135
00:08:48.021 --> 00:08:52.160
atmosphere. Some considerable distance above ground level,

136
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:55.560
perhaps 30 kilometers up chemists,

137
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.640
as opposed to people who are trying to fumigate clothes,

138
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.000
don't use phosphine very much.

139
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:08.010
I've only done one reaction in my career with a phosphine

140
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:08.970
derivative.

141
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.860
That's a compound between phosphine and iron pH three itself is

142
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.640
a slightly strange compound. All chemists know about it,

143
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:22.470
but if you ask them about the use, they would probably have to look it up.

144
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:27.570
Phosphine is used to kill rodents like rats.

145
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.150
Now you don't guess them with phosphine,

146
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:34.770
but instead you give them food that contains metal

147
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.760
phosphates. This food smells a bit of garlic,

148
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:43.650
but this doesn't seem to put the rats off from eating it.

149
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.050
And when they eat it,

150
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:51.330
the FOSS Fides in the food zinc, phosphite aluminum,

151
00:09:51.331 --> 00:09:56.130
phosphite reacts with the acid in the rat stomach and generates

152
00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.750
phosphene, which then poisons the rats. How do you stop it?

153
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:06.150
Poisoning other random holes. And there's quite a cunning twist.

154
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:11.550
The commercial rat poison usually contains an antimony compound,

155
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:16.560
which makes people violently sick and most animals.

156
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:21.000
And you mix this in with the rat poison.

157
00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:26.220
So you might ask why doesn't the rat gets sick as well,

158
00:10:26.221 --> 00:10:29.010
because if I add the rat poison or you did,

159
00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.220
you'd immediately vomit and it'll all come out again.

160
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.720
And it turns out that rats cannot form it.

161
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.940
They don't have the physiological mechanism to be sick.

162
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:47.250
So if you learn nothing else from the phosphene on Venus,

163
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.000
it's the fact that rats cannot be sick.
