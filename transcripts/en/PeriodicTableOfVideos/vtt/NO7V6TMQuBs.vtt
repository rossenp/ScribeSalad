00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.500
<v 0>I'm really excited.</v>

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.120
We've got two beautiful demonstrations to show you once the real

3
00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:10.470
classic, the ammonia fountain, the other one is completely new.

4
00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:14.220
One we've invented ourselves called Neil's balloon.

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.320
They're both based on the fact that ammonia gas is very soluble in

6
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:23.430
water. And when it dissolves in water, the water gets alkaline.

7
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.260
So if you put in an indicator that is colorless in

8
00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:32.430
water and red in alkaline, when the ammonia goes in,

9
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.630
the water gets right and we use the indicator. Finnell thirdly,

10
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.460
the classic experiment is called the ammonia fountain.

11
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.500
It consists of a large glass bulb filled with ammonia,

12
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.020
which has a cook or bang in the bottom with a glass tube going

13
00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:56.070
through it about halfway up the flask.

14
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.140
And the idea is if you put the bottom of the tube into water,

15
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.500
the ammonia starts dissolving in the water.

16
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.510
It creates a partial vacuum because you're absorbing gas.

17
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.250
And so the pressure is going down and the pressure of the atmosphere pushes more

18
00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:19.110
water into the flask, more ammonia dissolves. So more water goes in.

19
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.720
Now the problem was we set it all up.

20
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.000
Neil set it all up people to Monier into the flask ammonias light to the

21
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.980
nails. So you can just fill the flower skin up by putting the tube inside of it.

22
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.540
And he then put the bung into the flask.

23
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.580
And then before we started,

24
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.750
we had the tube just above the surface of a large jar of water.

25
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.760
And enough ammonia was coming out to start triggering the

26
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.770
indicator and the most beautiful red threads

27
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.300
started appearing in the jar. I was so excited. I nearly wanted to stop there.

28
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.410
Then we learned the tube into the water,

29
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.940
but there wasn't enough difference in pressure to get it

30
00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:06.840
started.

31
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.300
So Neil and I decided to pour some liquid nitrogen over the top,

32
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.780
which cooled the ammonia reduced its pressure,

33
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.720
and therefore began to suck in the water.

34
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.860
And once the water started going in, it was really beautiful.

35
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.840
<v 1>[Inaudible] ever seen it before.</v>

36
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.360
<v 0>Slight problem that the bang hadn't been pushed in quite hard enough.</v>

37
00:02:50.361 --> 00:02:54.560
So little air was leaking in as well, but that caused bubbling,

38
00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:57.440
which probably added to the effect. And for reasons,

39
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.440
they don't quite understand that as it went on the form of

40
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:07.000
the liquid film that was on the glass surface changed a

41
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:07.570
bit.

42
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.490
So there was an ever-changing patterns and also the color of the indicator

43
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:16.720
changed quite a bit. So it was really nice before we go onto the next one,

44
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:21.310
just let me remind you the reaction here is ammonia dissolving in

45
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:24.130
water, making it slightly alkaline.

46
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.040
And the red color is not part of the reaction.

47
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.340
That's an indicator to show you that the water is alkaline.

48
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.670
The next demonstration already.

49
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:38.590
It's an experiment because we didn't know whether it would work began with my

50
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:43.150
idea that we should try filling a balloon with ammonia because

51
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.040
ammonia is lighter than the air.

52
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.670
So I just wondered whether a balloon as ammonia would float,

53
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.700
not something you'd want to use as the party,

54
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.590
because if it bursts they'd be smell,

55
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.770
but it does float quite nicely.

56
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.260
Then we remembered that if you put sticky tape onto a

57
00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:03.094
balloon,

58
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.170
you can then stick a pin or a needle through the tape,

59
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.110
into the balloon without bursting it.

60
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.430
The reason for this is that when you normally prick a balloon,

61
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.410
when you make the first hole,

62
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.450
the fabric runs from that hole and its

63
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.290
slit goes up through the fabric and it breaks.

64
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.270
But if you have the rubber held by sticky tape, it can't move.

65
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.220
So we had the idea that we should try injecting water with

66
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.800
fin of Darlene into the balloon.

67
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.900
What we hoped was that the water would absorb the

68
00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:48.250
ammonia. So the pressure would go down and the balloon would shrink,

69
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.470
of course, with the fountain, the size of the flask can't change.

70
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.350
And of course it fills up with just more and more water.

71
00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.940
So the idea here was be a much simpler demonstration that we could do perhaps

72
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.680
more quickly before we started filming Neil practiced with a

73
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:08.560
syringe needle in the nitrogen balloon,

74
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.190
just sticking the needle in, it worked perfectly.

75
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.370
But then when we started filming,

76
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.290
the first balloon needle went in, there was no more bang

77
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.000
and we will run out to the room because the smell of ammonia,

78
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.110
the ammonia disperse is very quickly, so it's not dangerous.

79
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.223
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

80
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.350
<v 0>So for the third time I suggested we went to settle a tape or scotch tape</v>

81
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.660
rather than plastic tape.

82
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.200
And we use the bigger needle.

83
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:56.940
So we could inject the liquid faster. And it worked beautifully

84
00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:03.730
When the liquid went in,

85
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.950
the ammonia started being absorbed and the balloon beautifully shrank.

86
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.120
But what we didn't realize because Neil was holding,

87
00:06:13.121 --> 00:06:17.080
it was that when ammonia dissolves in water,

88
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.540
it produces a lot of heat.

89
00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.650
There is a positive heat of dissolution,

90
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.630
a heat of reaction.

91
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.700
So the balloon was actually getting hotter and hotter and Neil nearly

92
00:06:30.701 --> 00:06:31.450
dropped it.

93
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:36.340
However he managed to hang on till the balloon went from this sort of size to

94
00:06:36.341 --> 00:06:38.500
about the size of my class plans.

95
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.480
We were all really very pleased in a way it's a nicer demonstration to show how

96
00:06:43.481 --> 00:06:45.880
the gas is disappearing into the liquid.

97
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.000
Then the traditional emerg new fountain, because in that,

98
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.280
the size of the floss doesn't change,

99
00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.640
but really both of them have fun.
