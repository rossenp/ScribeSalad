00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.680
<v 0>This box has been in my cupboard a long time though,</v>

2
00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:09.090
this box is much older than most of the other stuff,

3
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.360
because I brought this when I was a school boy,

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.030
and it is travel around with me in this box.

5
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.260
There are some souvenirs of my grandfather.

6
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.850
The discharge is because they are tubes for electrical discharge.

7
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.490
I'll just show you this one because it stands up.

8
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.820
You can see it's a piece of quite ornate glassware.

9
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.470
And if you look, there are a number of features that you can see.

10
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.690
It has been sealed off here and here by

11
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.590
putting a torch. So it was sealed with a vacuum or gas in it,

12
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.740
and there's a narrow tube going inside,

13
00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:49.650
which goes round and round and round and so on.

14
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.980
And then they used to be an electrode at the top.

15
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.300
Now there's just a bit of wire and there's an electrode at the front.

16
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.190
This is an example of what is called a Geisler tube named of the

17
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.930
German physicist called Geisler who invented this in 1857.

18
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.100
It belonged with the other two to my grandfather,

19
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.200
my grandfather,

20
00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:18.120
who was called Joseph Poliakoff was an extraordinarily talented inventor.

21
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.780
He had, I don't know how many patents in his lifetime.

22
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.040
He invented the volume control, which is now on every radio.

23
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.680
He invented the hearing loop,

24
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.720
which helps deaf people here in concert halls and

25
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:36.540
so on and lots of other things as well.

26
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.250
He also invented an early form of the transistor in the

27
00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:45.360
1920s, but why he had these? I don't know.

28
00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:48.900
I think he probably just thought they were fun. And if you look at the glass,

29
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.790
the glass is slightly yellow because it's impregnated with some

30
00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:58.200
sort of iron, which fluoresces when exposed to UV light.

31
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.400
The point about these Geisla tubes is that they filled with a low pressure of

32
00:02:02.401 --> 00:02:03.900
gas. Unfortunately,

33
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:08.580
I don't know which sort of gas it's definitely not neon because neon would play

34
00:02:08.581 --> 00:02:12.570
red. It may be air. It could be air with a trace of mercury.

35
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.160
But the important thing about these gases are that when you apply a high

36
00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:17.994
voltage,

37
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.150
you used a device called a Tesla coil named after the famous

38
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.553
scientist, Tesla,

39
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.760
which produces a very high voltage at a very high

40
00:02:34.761 --> 00:02:35.600
frequency.

41
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.393
It's sufficient,

42
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.380
certainly high that it can jump across narrow gaps of insulators

43
00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:46.214
like air.

44
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.930
And what is to me even now remarkable is that if you apply them to these,

45
00:02:50.931 --> 00:02:55.850
you get to discharge to generate a plasma in the gas without having

46
00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:58.970
to have any electrical connection to the other.

47
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.690
Presumably there is enough current that will leak either through the glass

48
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.670
or to earth through the air.

49
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.450
The mechanism is the high voltage ionizes, the gas,

50
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.510
the ions recombine, and give out energy.

51
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.720
This makes the gas hot and it emits light.

52
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.130
Not necessarily just because it's hot, but because the electron,

53
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.180
as it falls back to the nucleus or to the energy levels,

54
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.320
which normally occupies gives out light. So it's a way of generating light,

55
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.970
right? And the particular gas will give a particular wavelength of light.

56
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.170
I don't know what this is, may be air even. And the reason I don't know,

57
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.930
gets a characteristic discharge from a gas,

58
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.500
which depends on the identity of the gas and the pressure.

59
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.010
And since we don't know the pressure and we don't know the gas,

60
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.720
it's a bit difficult to guess there are measurements we might be able to do,

61
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.550
but we might damage the tubes.

62
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.460
And any way we didn't have the kids at the moment,

63
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.270
this equipment must be quite old because my grandfather,

64
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.890
if he was still alive would be 143 years old and he died

65
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:10.270
55 years ago.

66
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.340
So the very minimum is probably 70 or 80 years old could be a

67
00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:16.330
hundred years old.

68
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.340
So the gas has been sealed inside the DAS for that time.

69
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.440
And the fact that they still work means they're still at low pressure

70
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.600
and air has not gone inside the tube from outside,

71
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.430
everything leaks slightly.

72
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.440
But the rate of leakage is so slow that the performance has not been affected.

73
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.600
And I find that pretty well.

74
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.790
The other thing which you can tell is that because the glass

75
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.330
and the liquid here glow,

76
00:04:54.331 --> 00:04:56.730
when the discharge takes place,

77
00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.000
it means that the gas is emitting UV light.

78
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.220
So presumably the tube going through here is either

79
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.030
glass that does not absorb UV light very strongly.

80
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.800
It could be quite thin glass,

81
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.990
or it may even be quartz there. If it's quartz,

82
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.670
it's a fantastic piece of glass blowing because quartz is not an easy material

83
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:21.653
to blue.

84
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.260
I once tried using this. I can't remember when,

85
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.290
when we used to have Tesla coils in the lamp,

86
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.540
but I haven't used it for 20 or 30 years at the

87
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.640
minimum, but then I thought that Neil would like to get his hands on it.

88
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.530
And I wasn't wrong.

89
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.150
What to me is remarkable is that these pieces of equipment,

90
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.700
which are made purely for entertainment,

91
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.920
they have no deep scientific value and were made

92
00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.130
to entertain audiences perhaps a hundred years ago are still working

93
00:06:01.131 --> 00:06:04.820
today and are still entertaining. People,

94
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.300
perhaps entertainment view definitely entertaining me,

95
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.130
but also pose intriguing questions. What is the liquid?

96
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.600
What is the glass made of and so on. And of course,

97
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.420
what immediately comes to mind is what techniques you could find to

98
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.110
identify these things without damaging the equipment.

99
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.230
I think that my grandfather would be quite

100
00:06:33.231 --> 00:06:37.730
amused. I knew him though. He died when I was 11,

101
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.900
but I think he would be very amused that it was being sold to such a big

102
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:42.763
audience.

103
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.840
He couldn't possibly have imagined the number of people that would watch

104
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.540
this video, even if it's not very successful,

105
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.090
we're talking about thousands of people watching it.

106
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.770
And so I think it is really quite a

107
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.230
attribute to my grandfather,

108
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.420
that the items that he collected and now being shared with a big audience.
