00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.800
<v 0>Brady has been to really interesting historical site.</v>

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.750
It is the site of the first nuclear reactor designed to

3
00:00:09.751 --> 00:00:10.980
make plutonium.

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.960
It started operation in 1943 in the middle of the second world

5
00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:20.880
war. The reactor is still there. There it's no longer operating.

6
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.680
I thought it was operating because there were three workers apparently working

7
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:29.310
on it. But then I realized that they were just models.

8
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.020
Brady thinks that's very funny.

9
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.430
<v 1>So we are at Oak Ridge national laboratory,</v>

10
00:00:34.431 --> 00:00:38.600
and this is the site of the world's first continuously operated reactor.

11
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.120
You may recall that at Chicago,

12
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.070
a pile of uranium and graphite led to the first measurement of criticality.

13
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.390
What happened here was the design and construction of the first

14
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.970
purpose-built reactor to run continuously.

15
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.760
There were three paths to a nuclear weapon.

16
00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:59.060
One of them was involved involved the production of plutonium,

17
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.990
which is an artificial element, which must be produced in a nuclear reactor.

18
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.190
This reactor was built to demonstrate that process.

19
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.290
It was a project led by farming.

20
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.560
The design was principally done by Eugene Wichner,

21
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.700
who was a Nobel prize winner who led research to the lab for a number of years.

22
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.510
And by Alvin Weinberg, who was the director of the lab for a number of years.

23
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.300
<v 2>Exactly three days after Hiroshima,</v>

24
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.490
I'll be 29 and set out for Nagasaki at 10 58, the morning of August 9th,

25
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.360
the bomb was exploded above the city. And in the towering mushroom,

26
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.160
Japan could read its doom.

27
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.470
<v 1>This is the face of the reactor.</v>

28
00:01:42.471 --> 00:01:46.940
This is where the fuel lodge would be inserted after they were in the

29
00:01:46.941 --> 00:01:49.130
reactor for a sufficient length of time,

30
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.440
they were then pushed out the other end.

31
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.450
They dropped into a pool and were drug underwater to a chemical

32
00:01:56.451 --> 00:02:00.260
plant where the plutonium was extracted.

33
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.590
You can see the rod that's actually used to push the rod,

34
00:02:03.591 --> 00:02:08.300
but inside many of those holes would be an aluminum rod that has within it,

35
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.880
pellets of uranium because more and more rods go in.

36
00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:12.470
What are we getting closer to? Well,

37
00:02:12.471 --> 00:02:16.880
you have neutrons flying around and eventually what happens is that enough

38
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.890
neutrons hit uranium fuel that you split enough Adams. Each Adam,

39
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.730
you split releases two neutrons, and now you start getting multiplication.

40
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.300
Criticality means actually getting to that point where the multiplication is

41
00:02:29.301 --> 00:02:32.810
enough to sustain the reaction when you kick them out. The other side, though,

42
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:35.300
it's not, you, haven't now got a broader, pure plutonium.

43
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.530
You have a log of a mixture of a lot of fishing products,

44
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.420
uranium that hasn't transformed.

45
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.540
And so you have to chemically separate all that. And that,

46
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.050
that is actually an art in itself. And that was done in a,

47
00:02:48.051 --> 00:02:49.850
in a building adjacent to them.

48
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.130
<v 0>Uranium has two isotopes atoms with different numbers</v>

49
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.000
of neutrons in them. There's uranium two, three, five,

50
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.060
which is in quite small abundance about 0.7% and

51
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:08.650
uranium two, three eight, which is 99.3% abundance.

52
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.720
And this reactor worked on the decay of the

53
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:16.360
uranium two, three, five,

54
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.920
which generated the neutrons, which then dumbbell did the target.

55
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.750
<v 3>This is your favorite room, isn't it?</v>

56
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.320
<v 1>Well, you know, I didn't control that. So this is the original control room.</v>

57
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.620
This is where the reactor was controlled from.

58
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.520
This is obviously model number one of controlled rooms for reactors.

59
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.290
And it looks similar to what subsequent reactors from that

60
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.573
era would have looked.

61
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.870
And so these various controls would tell you about power level and about

62
00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:50.730
radiation levels and the extent to which rods were inserted and

63
00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:54.420
things that relate to the operation of the systems, like the cooling systems.

64
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.970
This was leading to the production reactors,

65
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.470
which were to be built and were built in Hanford Washington for the actual

66
00:04:01.471 --> 00:04:04.350
production of kilogram quantities of platonic.

67
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.480
<v 3>Why is it called a graphite reactor?</v>

68
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.760
Cause you've been talking to me about uranium and plutonium.

69
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.320
<v 1>Oh, the graphite is the moderator.</v>

70
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.120
And so what you have to do is in the vision process,

71
00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:18.060
you get two neutrons off, but the energy is wrong.

72
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.100
And the graphite is one of the means by which you can reduce the energy to

73
00:04:23.101 --> 00:04:26.370
the range where you maximize the cross-section for the next vision.

74
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.290
So this is the actually the original log book from the day when the

75
00:04:31.291 --> 00:04:35.340
reactor first went critical and family was actually here and he was called at

76
00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:38.850
five o'clock in the morning because the researchers knew it was going to go

77
00:04:38.851 --> 00:04:42.530
critical. And he came in and observed. The first criticality of.

78
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.720
<v 3>As a scientist yourself is probably kept a few low books.</v>

79
00:04:45.721 --> 00:04:47.790
Do you look at that and feel a bit of excitement or.

80
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:48.601
<v 1>Well, you know,</v>

81
00:04:48.601 --> 00:04:53.310
we all fill out lock log books and we all have this hope that maybe our

82
00:04:53.311 --> 00:04:56.700
log book someday would get this level of attention.

83
00:04:56.701 --> 00:04:59.160
So it's actually quite exciting to be here and see this.

84
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.800
This is at the mid plane of the reactor.

85
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.760
And that means that the neutrons that are coming out from the reactor are going

86
00:05:05.761 --> 00:05:07.350
to come out horizontally.

87
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.070
And this is where the first neutron scattering measurement was done.

88
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.810
Now to give a little background,

89
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.090
we've got three ways of looking at the nanoscale or atomic scale properties of

90
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.380
materials. One is with the electron microscope. One is with x-rays.

91
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.420
And one that is probably not as well known is with neutrons and the

92
00:05:27.421 --> 00:05:30.360
neutrons associated with this reactor,

93
00:05:30.361 --> 00:05:33.120
which operates at thermal energies.

94
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.560
These neutrons have wavelengths comparable to the distances between atoms and

95
00:05:37.561 --> 00:05:41.730
solids. So you actually can do the fraction experiments from solids,

96
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.880
which leads to different information than you would get with x-rays.

97
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.770
It leads to information on magnetism.

98
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.660
It leads to information on the dynamics of the motions of the atoms

99
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.660
and the first neutron scattering experiments were done here.

100
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.540
And that led to a Nobel prize for cliff shul who developed neutron

101
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.360
scattering in the forties and fifties at this laboratory.

102
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.900
<v 0>I kept on wondering why they still had</v>

103
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.250
this reactor there. My theory, I have no idea if it's right,

104
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.230
is that the reactor is still so radioactive inside that it's

105
00:06:17.231 --> 00:06:21.970
easier to seal the outside and turn it into a museum than to work

106
00:06:21.971 --> 00:06:26.500
out how to decommission it before all the radioactivity inside has

107
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:27.963
dedicated way.

108
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.890
<v 1>This is the burst of the nuclear era from the perspective of the</v>

109
00:06:32.891 --> 00:06:36.010
scientific and technological application of neutrons.

110
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.000
And that has had a very important part and is the reason that Oak Ridge national

111
00:06:40.001 --> 00:06:44.860
laboratory exists today because the fact that this reactor

112
00:06:44.861 --> 00:06:48.730
existed after the war and this capability existed,

113
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.330
and it was important for isotopes and it was important for neutron scattering,

114
00:06:52.331 --> 00:06:56.020
and it was important for materials irradiation and the development of nuclear

115
00:06:56.021 --> 00:07:01.000
power is what led to the continuing of

116
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.030
the scientific effort here for peaceful purposes.

117
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.100
And that led to Oak Ridge national laboratory.

118
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.190
This is a special place to come in here often,

119
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.990
not often, but often enough to get rejuvenated.

120
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:25.870
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>
