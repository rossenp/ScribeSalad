00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.830
<v 0>Great is just been to India on holiday and he's shown me some</v>

2
00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:08.940
terrific pictures and video of the Taj Mahal.

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.010
I've never been there immediately when he showed me that I could see

4
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.540
that the building is being cleaned. And when you think about cleaning,

5
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.040
you think about chemistry.

6
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.200
The Taj Mahal is famous because it's white and it's white

7
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.770
because it's made of white marble. For years and years,

8
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.630
there has been a problem that the white marble gets dirty and it keeps on

9
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:36.750
getting dirty and they keep on having to clean it.

10
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.320
Why is the Taj Mahal dirty? How do you know what the dirt is?

11
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.820
How'd you get rid of it?

12
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.780
I looked around and I couldn't find any completely white marble,

13
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.960
but I found this lump of marble here,

14
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.500
which is a reasonable piece of carved marble.

15
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.190
Rather like the things that you might find in the Taj Mahal, the of course,

16
00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.600
a different style and what's more, it's dirty. Then it was in our house.

17
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.640
That's why I found it. And it's been laying in the fireplace in our house.

18
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.280
So it's got quite a lot of dirt and dust on it.

19
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.710
The first thing about a marble,

20
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.020
which I can show you is that some dust you could rub off quite

21
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.950
easily with a brush, although it's quite tedious,

22
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.610
you can brush even the Taj Mahal.

23
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.410
So there's some dirt like the dirt here, which brushing doesn't remove.

24
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.160
So the question is, how do you find that what it is?

25
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.290
I found a really quite interesting scientific paper that was published

26
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.280
two years ago,

27
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.360
where they actually solve this problem of finding out what the dirt was.

28
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.440
The problem is that the Taj Mahal is a huge building.

29
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.730
You can't very easily climb up with microscopes or

30
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.410
spectrometers high on the walls, but these authors had a really clever idea.

31
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.330
They took small pieces of marble,

32
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.370
essentially the same material that the Taj Mahal is made of and glued

33
00:02:02.371 --> 00:02:04.890
it to the walls in various places,

34
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.690
and then left it a few months and took it back to the lab and looked at the

35
00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:14.100
surface on what they found was that even after short time,

36
00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:18.840
the surface became slightly colored and it was due to particles,

37
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.730
very small particles, not more than three microns in diameter,

38
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.470
that's three millions of a meter and they were essentially particles of carbon.

39
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.060
Now, you know, we always like to do experiments on periodic videos.

40
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.980
And for once I can do an experiment or try to do one in my

41
00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:41.790
office, I'm not going to do it on my precious piece of marble,

42
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.850
but here we've got a piece of limestone,

43
00:02:44.851 --> 00:02:49.410
which is very similar to marble in chemically it's calcium carbonate.

44
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.460
So what I'm going to do is to light the candle.

45
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.390
If some of you have watched a Halloween candle video,

46
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.670
you will know that out of the top of candle, flame,

47
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.770
you get sooty particles and I'm going to just try passing

48
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:07.390
it underneath.

49
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.403
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

50
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.000
<v 0>No, the first thing to say that what I've done is equivalent to</v>

51
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.710
centuries of the Taj Mahal being exposed to the atmosphere.

52
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.920
But you know, we'd like to accelerate things for you.

53
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.450
So what we now have is a mixture of carbon particles and some

54
00:03:33.451 --> 00:03:37.830
waxy oily solid. Now, if you go back to Brady's amazing pictures,

55
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.800
the clean parts are strikingly white,

56
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.350
and some parts are slightly yellow.

57
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.770
Brady described it as rather like old paper,

58
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.750
but this is is black because I cheated and used a really

59
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.290
powerful source of carbon on the small area,

60
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.530
in the case of the Taj Mahal. And in particular,

61
00:03:58.531 --> 00:04:03.330
the atmosphere of Agra, there are particles of carbon in the air,

62
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.250
but their density is quite low and they land every so often on the

63
00:04:08.251 --> 00:04:11.790
surface. And gradually as the layer builds up,

64
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.140
it will tend to change color. It will begin very pale yellow,

65
00:04:16.141 --> 00:04:20.700
and then probably get darker and darker as the layers build up. Now,

66
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.200
I'm not going to discuss in great detail the origins of the air

67
00:04:25.201 --> 00:04:29.550
pollution, but at least some of it comes from vehicle exhausts.

68
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.710
The gas is coming out or unburned particles coming out to the back of cars and

69
00:04:34.711 --> 00:04:35.544
lorries.

70
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.260
So now the authorities at the Taj Mahal have

71
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.210
banned vehicles with internal combustion engines from quite a large

72
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.350
radius round

73
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.730
and Brady and the others tourists have to make little

74
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.480
journeys in sort of electric golf, buggies,

75
00:04:57.481 --> 00:05:02.130
or the equivalent to do the final half mile or so to get there,

76
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.130
to try and keep the air a bit cleaner around it.

77
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.570
Of course there are other emissions from industrial plants nearby,

78
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.430
and they're also emissions from people burning fuel

79
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.050
such as co down. So it's a big mixture of sources,

80
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.030
but the real problem is how do you get it off the stone?

81
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.190
What you have is a fairly thin surface covering of this

82
00:05:29.191 --> 00:05:32.070
dirt, which you could in principle scrape off,

83
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.920
but that would damage the surface of the marble.

84
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.040
So next time it will get harder to remove.

85
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.020
And every time it'll get harder and harder, somehow you've got to use chemicals.

86
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.650
The problem is that marble is calcium carbonate,

87
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.110
which is very sensitive for acid.

88
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.000
Even the acid that comes from industrial emissions are enough to

89
00:05:54.001 --> 00:05:55.410
damage the surface.

90
00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.080
So you've got to use something that chemically is very neutral

91
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.780
or even slightly alkaline. So in fact, the authorities at times,

92
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.620
Mahal have used a method, which is in fact,

93
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:11.510
I think quite a traditional method,

94
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.580
which is based on the way that people in the old days used

95
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:19.280
to treat wool. Now, fortunately,

96
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.380
I don't need to produce a sample of seeps will because you can

97
00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:26.840
see quite a good simulation here.

98
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.660
But in the old days,

99
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.880
the people who cleaned up wool we're called folders.

100
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.790
And they used a mineral called folders earth,

101
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.320
which on one hand removed particles of dirt and stuff,

102
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.430
sticking to the surface of the sheep's wool.

103
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.350
It also removed the last vestiges of oil

104
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.580
and grease from the wall and also made the wall rather than denser.

105
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.200
This is a sort of clay which goes into very fine

106
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.020
particles and those particles are very good.

107
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.130
It's absorbing combination of dirt and oil.

108
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.930
If you mix it with water,

109
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.770
it forms of paste like mud.

110
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.670
So you can put it on the surface of the stone, like a mud pack.

111
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.800
And after a day or two,

112
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.850
it dries and cracks as it dries,

113
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.330
it becomes very flaky and you can just brush it off.

114
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:30.310
You can remove the carbon particles from the surface. Very gently.

115
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.350
Clay are quite complicated,

116
00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:37.300
mixtures of very fine particles and minerals that are based on Allie

117
00:07:37.301 --> 00:07:42.040
minium and alkaline metals like sodium potassium and calcium.

118
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.640
The key point is that they are ionic compounds.

119
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:48.100
The aluminium has often had,

120
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.880
will have hydroxyl groups or H groups on the surface,

121
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.360
particularly if you made it into a slurry with water,

122
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.330
but because the particles are so small,

123
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:03.070
each gram of material will have a very high surface area.

124
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:08.020
And therefore it means there is a big surface to attract the carbon

125
00:08:08.021 --> 00:08:10.210
particles of the marble.

126
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.430
And you don't need an enormous difference in the attraction between the surface

127
00:08:15.431 --> 00:08:19.270
of the marble and the Fuller's earth,

128
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:23.110
because you're leaving the mud pack on for a period of some days.

129
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:28.210
And that slight difference is enough to remove most of the particles.

130
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.030
And again, you don't have to remove them all,

131
00:08:31.031 --> 00:08:34.870
but the more you remove the cleaner, the marble will look,

132
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:40.000
I think it's really nice that you can use the same material to

133
00:08:40.001 --> 00:08:44.440
clean cheap fleeces to clean the Taj Mahal.

134
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.330
But the important thing is that these materials were

135
00:08:49.331 --> 00:08:53.770
identified over a period of centuries, if not thousands of years.

136
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:58.830
So they have probably some of the best natural materials you can

137
00:08:58.831 --> 00:09:03.150
get because people have tried so many and found that this is the best

138
00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.700
I am in India, in Mumbai.

139
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:11.920
What used to be called Bombay and behind me is the famous tans,

140
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.640
my whole hotel. And when I'm in India, of course,

141
00:09:16.641 --> 00:09:20.540
I begin to think about Indian chemistry, Indian science,

142
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.870
I'm on Bondai beach in Sydney, Australia.

143
00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:29.720
And I want to talk to you about ozone because there's an interesting paper.

144
00:09:29.721 --> 00:09:31.070
That's just been published.
