00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>We're going to have a look at today, something that's, uh,</v>

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.030
been hitting the headlines and we're going to be talking about this compound

3
00:00:06.031 --> 00:00:10.190
here. Rejoice is under the acronym too, for DMP.

4
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.440
So that stands for dine nitro,

5
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.390
fennel hydrazine you particularly so we'll appreciate it because it's trivial

6
00:00:17.391 --> 00:00:19.040
name is Brady's reagent,

7
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.240
but it also rejoices under the trivial name of Bosch is region. Well,

8
00:00:23.241 --> 00:00:27.800
I guess what we'd like to start the story with is taking you way back

9
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.110
to the Dawn of organic chemistry in maybe the 1750s through to

10
00:00:33.111 --> 00:00:34.490
about 18 hundreds.

11
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.930
All of the modern techniques that as a student or as a member of the public that

12
00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:43.490
we learn about the full of martyr of modern analytical techniques are not

13
00:00:43.491 --> 00:00:44.840
available. In fact,

14
00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:48.560
the only technique that's available is to measure the melting point of your

15
00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:53.540
compound, and that kind of can create some, uh, difficulty for you.

16
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.300
And I've got an example here that we're going to look at this morning.

17
00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.740
So this is a popular compound. This is a compound of benzene.

18
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.510
It's a derivative and it has an aldehyde group on it. But as you can see,

19
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.600
there's going to be an intrinsic problem with measuring the melting point of

20
00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:10.850
Ben's out a high in that it's a liquid.

21
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.320
And if melting points are the only thing you can do is you need a way to be sure

22
00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:19.100
that everything that's in that aldehyde or carbon IO class,

23
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.610
you can turn into a solid that you can then even measure the melting point,

24
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.560
even in 1750. And that's the essence of the Rady's reagent or DMP,

25
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.120
something that you can be sure that you can react an aldehyde or a ketone with

26
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.290
to give you a solid crystalline reagent. And back in the day,

27
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.660
it would come as a solid.

28
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.380
So what we're going to do now is we're going to look at the original formulation

29
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.240
of the DMP Brady's reagent as it was supplied up until I

30
00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:50.330
guess, uh, probably about a year and a half. Okay. So we're in here.

31
00:01:50.331 --> 00:01:53.210
So we're going to have to do a bit of mining because this has been packaged up.

32
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.500
This is just secondary containment. So this is just a plastic outer shell.

33
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.330
And now we can get to the beast in its original form,

34
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.540
and you can see here's the D for the die.

35
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.190
There's the end for the nitro and there's the P for the phenol hydrazine.

36
00:02:10.191 --> 00:02:13.970
So D N P gives you the, uh, Brady's reagent.

37
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.930
If the compound is normal, unrelated, correctly,

38
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.830
it'll be completely safe and stable, and we have no need to worry,

39
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.990
but if it's dry,

40
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.350
then that's when all the fun and games and excitement starts.

41
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.350
So I've deliberately selected, uh,

42
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.080
a compound where I believe it to be dry.

43
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.460
So I'm just going to point that away from me a little bit and just open up

44
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.120
gently. So the compounds not terribly volatile.

45
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.270
So I'm handling this in a hood, but, uh,

46
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.040
what we're going to do is probably get a sheet of paper in here so that we can

47
00:02:49.041 --> 00:02:51.770
put a little bit out so that you can see and you brought,

48
00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:56.660
you should see if we can spoon some out is a

49
00:02:56.661 --> 00:02:58.730
highly bright orange. Now these are not,

50
00:02:58.731 --> 00:03:03.280
crystals are aggregates where the small little microcrystals have all started to

51
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:06.520
come together. As it's drying out, when it dries out,

52
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.650
then the reagent can become more unstable. It can suffer an order,

53
00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:14.740
catalytic decomposition. So order could tell us,

54
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.070
this is where the products of a reaction encourage the reaction to become

55
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:21.670
faster, which generate more products so that it becomes even faster.

56
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.430
And of course, that's how you get a runaway reaction.

57
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.740
And that's what we call an explosion. Um,

58
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.420
we're going to test that a little bit later,

59
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.920
but let's actually focus on why the reagents used and why it's useful.

60
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.460
And let's take you back again to the 1750s.

61
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.820
And if you remember, we had, uh,

62
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.080
this compound benzaldehyde where clearly we don't have a solid,

63
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.600
so we would like to make a solid derivative of it.

64
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.540
We would have to take the solid and we would have to dissolve it.

65
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.460
And that'll take us a little bit of time.

66
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.700
So what we're going to do is use the luxury of modern chemistry.

67
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.670
And what I've done here is, as they say in blue, Peter,

68
00:03:57.671 --> 00:03:59.020
here's what I prepared earlier.

69
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.430
So this is just a solution of this orange compound. I put it into solution.

70
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.880
And so what you should see here, I hope has a bright orange solution come up.

71
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.180
Right? Okay. So we're going to try and turn our benzaldehyde into a,

72
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.223
into a solid.

73
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.990
Now I just mentioned that chemists like to do all of their reactions in

74
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:19.330
solution. So we're going to use methanol.

75
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.670
We're just going to use that as a solvent for the reaction.

76
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.740
So we need to get both, uh, our orange hydrazine and our carbon,

77
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.010
our compound in the same solution. So I'm going to take some, uh,

78
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.210
benzaldehyde here. And what I'm going to do is do a,

79
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.790
not terribly stoichiometric reaction. So we're going to take,

80
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.580
that'll probably about, be about a 150, a hundred, 200 milligrams,

81
00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:45.190
something like that. So we'll put that into the solvent.

82
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.210
Let's put the lid back on here, ends out a high desert,

83
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.410
very nice smell of almonds, but it's like toxic, super toxic.

84
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.180
And now we need to switch and see if we can get this to make a

85
00:04:58.181 --> 00:05:03.090
precipitate. So let's see a benzaldehyde has got a, uh,

86
00:05:03.091 --> 00:05:06.490
a mass of about a hundred. So we've got about two millimoles in here.

87
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.780
This is about 0.2 molar. So we need a, a reasonable amount of this,

88
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.490
the right reaction of DMP, or Brady's reagent with aldehydes,

89
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.710
uh, depends on the substrate. And it can take anything from instantaneous up to,

90
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.120
uh, several hours. So, right.

91
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.330
So let's just stop there. Oh, look, there you go.

92
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.380
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

93
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.340
<v 0>So, as you can see, we've got almost instantaneous reaction.</v>

94
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.310
We've produced from our original liquid.

95
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.500
Benzaldehyde a large clump of a bright orange, yellow

96
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.310
Chemists, like to use names to describe their derivatives.

97
00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.010
So we started a hydrazine. So this derivative is a Hydrostone. Okay.

98
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:05.210
So we've talked a lot about the chemistry of DNP and why it's really useful,

99
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.930
but it won't have escaped your attention that in media recently,

100
00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:11.980
there's been a lot of concern over Brady's reagent,

101
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.190
DNP as a potential source of explosion, the compound,

102
00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:18.410
as it was originally formulated damp,

103
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.520
perfectly safe in the modern version that we've shown you perfectly safe.

104
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.160
The compound does have a reputation though,

105
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.790
for being what is called shock sensitive,

106
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.560
meaning that if the compound is subjected to friction or sudden energy through

107
00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:35.390
an impact, it can detonate.

108
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.930
That's not so well described actually in the scientific literature.

109
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.730
And so in the cause of science,

110
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.500
what we're going to do is try and make a brief investigation at a small and

111
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:49.760
therefore potentially safe scale to indicate what the degree of shock

112
00:06:49.761 --> 00:06:52.670
sensitivity is as formulated in wet.

113
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.700
There shouldn't really be that much shock sensitivity in Brady's reagent.

114
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.591
But like I said,

115
00:06:56.591 --> 00:07:00.130
there's very little data and we're not going to take any chances. So I,

116
00:07:00.131 --> 00:07:04.610
I'm not gonna put on not just a face mask, but this is an explosion face mask.

117
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.070
And if it explodes, it'll protect my face still. Uh, and I'm going to,

118
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.430
don't want to lose any fingers.

119
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.120
So I'm going to go for some protective gloves as well,

120
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:15.711
chest the shock sensitivity.

121
00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:19.610
I'm going to use this highly expensive scientific piece of apparatus available

122
00:07:19.611 --> 00:07:22.550
from any good hardware store. And we're going to strike the compound,

123
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.480
not accessibly hard because it shouldn't need that. If it, if it's going to go.

124
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.700
So I'm going to give it a light tap and then we'll see one, two, three

125
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.190
that I think is me missing. So we'll do that again. One, two,

126
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.670
three, we struck the compound.

127
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.110
We might want to come in and have a look at back and see here at the back.

128
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.930
This is where it was struck with a hammer, quite vigorously,

129
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:52.910
no effect whatsoever. You can make the comparison against the material.

130
00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:56.430
That's jumped off the front here. These are exactly the same color, uh,

131
00:07:56.431 --> 00:07:58.460
and that's quite a decent strike. Okay?

132
00:07:58.461 --> 00:08:02.240
So what we should do now is let's dry the compound out and see if it makes a

133
00:08:02.241 --> 00:08:07.070
difference. So again, the literature is not too clear. Uh, and in,

134
00:08:07.071 --> 00:08:08.990
in view of safety concerns,

135
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.540
we're going to be a little bit vague about how long we're going to dry this

136
00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:12.350
compound,

137
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:15.980
but we're going to put it on this hot plate that you can see in the back of the

138
00:08:15.981 --> 00:08:16.610
hood.

139
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:20.390
You can see the red flashing light indicating that the hot plate is heating.

140
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.670
And if you look closely at the dial here,

141
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:25.640
you can see it's set at just over 100 degrees C,

142
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.900
so that should drive off any water. And then we'll rerun our shock test.

143
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:35.060
And we're going to put that on the hot flight. And now,

144
00:08:35.061 --> 00:08:37.580
as they say, in the fire code, retire to a safety,

145
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:47.321
Okay.

146
00:08:47.321 --> 00:08:52.060
So we're back in part two of the great shock detonation story.

147
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:57.150
So while we've been away having a cup of tea, what we've left is our hot plate,

148
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.650
which you can see in the background there. And we've been cooking up our DMP.

149
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:06.600
So we're up at the top here and on three, two,

150
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:07.883
one,

151
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.210
this compound is not accessibly shock sensitive.

152
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.740
Okay. But what I should add at this point of course,

153
00:09:22.741 --> 00:09:25.410
is we've done this under a very controlled condition.

154
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.960
We've done this with a very small amount of material.

155
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.840
The compound has a reputation for shock sensitivity.

156
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.750
Therefore there have been detonations in the past.

157
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.330
Clearly we've done this for you today,

158
00:09:36.331 --> 00:09:41.040
so that you can see and feel confident in, uh, in the chemistry. But, uh,

159
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:45.270
I wouldn't advise you to take any 14 pound sledgehammers and dustbins full of

160
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.193
them.

161
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.240
<v 2>Depression. Doesn't expand very rapidly.</v>

162
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:55.220
