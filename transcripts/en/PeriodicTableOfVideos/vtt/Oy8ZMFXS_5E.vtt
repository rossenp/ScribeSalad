00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.230
<v 0>It's been a really good start to 2016 from the point of view of the periodic</v>

2
00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:05.040
table,

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.870
are you pack the international union of pure and applied chemistry has

4
00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:13.170
confirmed the existence of four new elements.

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.050
So if you look at the periodic table here,

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.120
we have elements 113, 115,

7
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.830
117, 118 that have no names at the moment.

8
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.000
They have symbols. You U P meaning one, one, five,

9
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.010
but they don't have a real name.

10
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.460
And what's happened is not new experiments,

11
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.800
but the committees looking at the experimental evidence have

12
00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:45.420
decided that those elements really have been synthesized

13
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.030
and a real so in a way,

14
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.210
it's a bit like giving a prize to the people.

15
00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:52.920
Who've done the experiments to say,

16
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.290
you've got it right before we go into possible names for these elements.

17
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.430
Let me just remind you if you haven't watched our videos before,

18
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.020
how you make these elements. If you look at the periodic table,

19
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.000
all the elements that are heavier than uranium, number 92,

20
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.930
all of these are highly radioactive.

21
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.730
And as you go along the periodic table, they become more and more radioactive.

22
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.430
Even if you have some atoms,

23
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.360
they decay in fractions of a second or just a few seconds.

24
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.280
So you can't take them out to the ground. You have to make them.

25
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.620
And the way you make them is by taking a lighter item,

26
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.720
which is still quite heavy and bombarding that

27
00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:47.550
material with lighter atoms, you do this. So billions of lights,

28
00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:52.440
atoms hit every second. And then every so often,

29
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.890
perhaps once a week for difficult elements, once a month,

30
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.780
one of these atoms fuses into the other one.

31
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.970
So you can see it's quite a hard process and my dog toys getting a bit old.

32
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.510
So now you have a combined nucleus. For example,

33
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.280
we have element 95, I'm a research team.

34
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.380
Plus element co SIM 2020 plus

35
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.950
95 makes 115 and bingo,

36
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.050
you get an atom of the element because this atom is quite

37
00:02:28.051 --> 00:02:32.580
unstable. So you detect it by watching it decay.

38
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.470
These elements here have been discovered in different labs

39
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.750
usually, but not always as a collaboration between two different

40
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.040
laboratories.

41
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.480
And you have to understand that these are such specialized experiments,

42
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.740
that you will only find one suitable lab in a particular country.

43
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.060
And often, most countries don't even have such labs.

44
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.780
So element 113 was first discovered in the lab in

45
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:02.560
Japan.

46
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.430
We have a video in Japanese about it for our Japanese so-so

47
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.290
[inaudible] and the other elements. Yeah, one, one, five, one, one seven one,

48
00:03:16.291 --> 00:03:21.090
one eight work collaborations between us lab and

49
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.450
the research center in Dubai now near Moscow.

50
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.120
And so the experiments were done in [inaudible]

51
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.953
, but the precursors, the radioactive materials, like berkelium, which were the heavy element that we crushed into were prepared in America and flown over.

52
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.340
Now you have to understand that the way that our U pike operates is

53
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.610
that after the first lab has done the experiments,

54
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.100
they require somebody else to do the repeat of the experiments to make

55
00:03:53.101 --> 00:03:56.790
sure the first ones are bright. So, although for example,

56
00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.680
I might have done the first experiments I don't synthesize and elements,

57
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.180
but just as an example,

58
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.720
then somebody else will confirm my results.

59
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.490
So it's only polite.

60
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.690
And I think nice to talk to the other people before choosing a name,

61
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.280
there's certain rules. You can name it after places, countries,

62
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.653
people,

63
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.100
but the important thing is the person has to be a scientist.

64
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.540
Who's dead. My feeling is, and I have no idea what the name's going to be,

65
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.100
but I think element one, one,

66
00:04:29.101 --> 00:04:33.720
three is likely to have a Japanese name because

67
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.700
the Japanese library Reichen has been told they can choose the name.

68
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.930
There is a fruit which some of you may know called japonica.

69
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.570
So you could imagine a name,

70
00:04:45.571 --> 00:04:48.840
something like japonica based on Japan,

71
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.790
it would have the simple JP J doesn't appear on the periodic

72
00:04:53.791 --> 00:04:55.860
table yet. So that would be really nice.

73
00:04:55.861 --> 00:05:00.360
First sometimes Germans call ID by the letter

74
00:05:00.361 --> 00:05:05.130
J but most periodic tables don't have a J there is some

75
00:05:05.131 --> 00:05:08.850
internet chatter, and I've heard rumors that element one, one,

76
00:05:08.851 --> 00:05:13.080
five will be called Moscow Vivian after Moscow.

77
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.330
I think that will be really good. Then of course,

78
00:05:15.331 --> 00:05:20.130
the symbol M O has already gone for molybdenum.

79
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.210
I like Muskogee because my father was born in Moscow.

80
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.850
I have also suggested that element one,

81
00:05:26.851 --> 00:05:30.900
one seven should be called after Richard Fineman,

82
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.750
the famous physicist find Manian.

83
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.970
But some viewers already said that find

84
00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:42.600
Manian should be left for element 132,

85
00:05:42.601 --> 00:05:47.550
which find month predicted might be stable. So we'll have to see,

86
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.440
I feel probably that the most thoughts will be given by

87
00:05:52.441 --> 00:05:54.780
people two elements, 118,

88
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.750
because that's the highest number currently on the

89
00:05:59.751 --> 00:06:00.890
periodic table.

90
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.740
And I have no idea what they will choose. You will see all over the press.

91
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.040
People are saying the periodic table is now complete,

92
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.620
which in a way it is that we've finished this row of the

93
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.420
periodic table, the seventh row, as you go down one, two, three,

94
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.720
four, five, six, seven.

95
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.760
But I see this just as a beginning, the field is now open.

96
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.950
Can physicists now synthesize elements,

97
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.630
which will start row number eight down here.

98
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.010
The first element that's likely to be synthesized is one,

99
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.840
120,

100
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:50.150
because even numbered elements are more stable than odd numbered

101
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.020
elements.

102
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:56.030
And so it will be really interesting to see whether one of

103
00:06:56.031 --> 00:06:57.770
these elements can be made. Soon.

104
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.300
Periodic table is always waiting for new results. In fact,

105
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.980
we already have a video about the possibility of element 120,

106
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.680
which you can watch. If you're interested,

107
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.850
chemistry is not finished. This is just the beginning.

108
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.530
And I hope that 2016 is going to be a really exciting year for

109
00:07:20.531 --> 00:07:23.770
chemistry and for science in general. So again,

110
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.630
happy new year to you all great success in your science and keep working.

111
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.650
