00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.590
<v 0>We've been cleaning out the lab so that it can be refurbished so we can teach</v>

2
00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:07.590
our students better and hidden. At the back,

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.870
we found a really long tube.

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.090
<v 1>Which P license.</v>

5
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.880
<v 0>That had made to do the barking dog experiment, our favorite experiments,</v>

6
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.410
but he'd found that it was a bit awkward to use in lectures.

7
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.670
So it'd been forgotten.

8
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.540
Bulking dogs are usually done in quite a short too. [inaudible]

9
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.020
it's over a meter long, and this one is seriously long,

10
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.530
probably three or four meters long.

11
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.010
So you probably will remember it because you've seen it lots of times in our

12
00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:46.844
videos.

13
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.950
It's the reaction of carbon disulfide with [inaudible] nitrous oxide.

14
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.860
<v 1>And we've got our barking dog ready to go. Let's see if it box.</v>

15
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.320
<v 0>So you fill it too with nitrous, oxide, gas,</v>

16
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.600
add some water, then you pour in a cup and they sell five.

17
00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:06.620
That's a liquid.

18
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.060
And then you shake the tube and the water mixes everything up.

19
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.180
<v 1>And it could mix. So you can ensure that we get all of that calmness off.</v>

20
00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:18.090
I going into the vapor phase two to react really quite quickly without oxygen

21
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.183
and two.

22
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.300
<v 0>So the water as you turn the tube sloshes up and down,</v>

23
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.980
and that's rather like a piston to help mix the carbon de

24
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.980
sulfide, which is evaporating with the end too.

25
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.140
So you get the gas phase mixture.

26
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.790
And of course the more you shake it all being well, the better it's mixed.

27
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.653
<v 2>[Inaudible]. So with the first one.</v>

28
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.123
<v 0>We tried,</v>

29
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.660
what happened was that we were in a bit of a hurry and I don't think

30
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.790
perhaps we mixed it well enough,

31
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.090
because what happened was that when the tube was lit,

32
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.320
the first 30 centimeters or so lit up,

33
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.630
and the flame was almost stationary,

34
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.590
Neil had time to walk away from the experiment

35
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.030
and then slowly the flame started accelerating down the

36
00:02:26.031 --> 00:02:30.470
tube and then surprisingly in the middle, it almost stopped.

37
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.690
Might've even gone up a bit.

38
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.450
And then it went with a nice flush down to the bottom and it gave a very

39
00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:39.830
nice deep note,

40
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.350
which those of you who study physics were realized the longer tube you have

41
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.120
as in an organ tube, the deeper the note. So that wasn't surprising.

42
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.873
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

43
00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.730
<v 0>But what I thought was that perhaps some of the,</v>

44
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.060
um, effect that we'd seen was because of the bad mixing.

45
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.800
So in some places we had almost too much carbon sulfide,

46
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.890
it was rich in fuel and other places.

47
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:16.150
There was a lot of nitrous oxide, and not much those self-aid,

48
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.210
which explained the sort of stop start of the whole thing.

49
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.920
The other thing which you might see in the particularly the slow motion pictures

50
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.810
is that the reaction gives us quite a lot of ultraviolet light,

51
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.460
which makes Neil's white lab coat fluoresce.

52
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.400
It suddenly looks purple and quite impressively.

53
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:41.050
So I persuaded Neil to clean the tube and

54
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.720
try and experiment the next day. Now,

55
00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:48.670
the reason why it took some persuading is because when the sulfur is

56
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:53.470
formed on the walls, it's initially formed in a form of sulfur.

57
00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:55.870
That's called plastic sulfur,

58
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.490
which is made up of long chains of self rattans,

59
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.630
which are insoluble and most common solvents.

60
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.290
So you can't just wash it out. However,

61
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.450
if you wait a few days,

62
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.210
then the plastic selfer turns into so-called

63
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.020
Rumbek sulfur, which contains S eight rings,

64
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.380
which is dissolved and all sorts of common solvent.

65
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.130
So you've just put in this liquid and you can wash it out in a few minutes.

66
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.870
So normally we just wait and then it's easy to clean.

67
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.410
But this time Neil was really scrubbing hard.

68
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.540
The next day we tried again, he mixed for a long time,

69
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.780
and this time the reaction went much better.

70
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.540
It still began with quite a slow start,

71
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.280
but then it went more smoothly with some bouncing,

72
00:04:59.281 --> 00:05:00.600
like we've seen before,

73
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.100
possibly the bouncing again, due to the shockwave, hitting the bottom.

74
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.020
And we got some very nice fluorescence from Neil's lab coat.

75
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:36.030
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

76
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.680
<v 0>If you look at the tube, the Selfridge is still not deposited uniformly.</v>

77
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.150
So I think we got the mixing good enough to get good demonstration.

78
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.490
We didn't get the mixing good enough to get to completely uniform reacts.

79
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.200
And I think this illustrates a very important point about chemical

80
00:05:55.201 --> 00:05:56.100
reactions.

81
00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.340
That can be very important for the results and the bigger the

82
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:06.320
vessel you have. The more important it is to get your mixing uniform,

83
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.330
or you can get some free, strange results.

84
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.090
<v 3>The second thing was that we noticed something that we'd seen before the flame</v>

85
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.530
shoots along the tube,

86
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.930
and then suddenly stops and bounces and goes rather more slowly, but also late.
