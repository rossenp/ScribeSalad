00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.220
<v 0>This episode was made possible by Wix.</v>

2
00:00:02.221 --> 00:00:04.410
And we'll tell you more about them later in the episode

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.680
today, we're going inside the nuclear reactor and not just any reactor,

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.660
but the react to the tooth used to make the rare isotopes of

5
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:21.600
elements like berkelium California,

6
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.860
the ones that are so important for synthesizing the super-heavy elements.

7
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.530
<v 1>So this is an old reactor.</v>

8
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.930
And the reason why this reactor is here is because of a gentleman named Glenn

9
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:35.690
seaboard.

10
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.190
He had a lot of work at Berkeley labs and he had a vision of practicing that

11
00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:43.050
work on these heavy elements, but he didn't have a great supply of.

12
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.480
<v 0>And we can look forward with the hope that nuclear energy will become the</v>

13
00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:49.820
servant of all men everywhere.

14
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.870
<v 1>He pushed the atomic energy commission through the fifties,</v>

15
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.530
pushed and pushed and pushed. And finally, uh,

16
00:00:56.531 --> 00:00:59.330
of course he won the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1951,

17
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.230
and he'd get a little bit of credibility. And, uh,

18
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.880
and he finally made some progress in the late fifties, 1958.

19
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.660
And, uh, the atomic energy commission said, yeah, we want to do this.

20
00:01:11.661 --> 00:01:14.690
We want to build a reactor to produce heavy elements for you to do your

21
00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:17.060
chemistry. And so, uh,

22
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.120
the commission looked around the country at the time.

23
00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:22.100
And at that time in the late fifties,

24
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.060
there was a lot happening with nuclear reactors, lots of drawings,

25
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.540
a lot of designs being put on paper, particularly here in Oak Ridge.

26
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.200
<v 0>Medicos, atomic city at Oak Ridge, Tennessee has been open to the public.</v>

27
00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:35.840
And even the opening was by atomic energy. Watch that tape.

28
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.940
<v 1>Had the only school that was specifically designed for reactor engineering.</v>

29
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.550
It was called the Oakridge reactor engineering school.

30
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.660
And this gentleman who's on the wall. Dick Sheverton has a plaque up here.

31
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.580
He was a student in that school at that time. And he'd come up with a concept.

32
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.780
And the commissioner of the atomic energy commission saw this concept and said,

33
00:01:59.781 --> 00:02:00.920
yeah, I think this is the one.

34
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.290
<v 0>Lenti Seaborg needed a nuclear reactor with a high neutron</v>

35
00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:11.150
flux so that he could get the elements to study up till

36
00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:15.620
then he had gone to the sites where they had been nuclear tests

37
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.880
and looked among the rubble for traces of these elements.

38
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.310
And obviously this is not very environmentally friendly and there's a limit to

39
00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.800
the number of nuclear tests that can be done.

40
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.630
And people are not very interested in doing a test just to make some exotic

41
00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:33.464
elements.

42
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.790
<v 1>In 1960,</v>

43
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:39.380
they broke ground on this site and then they put the reactor building in and put

44
00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:43.490
the reactor in and they were up and running by 1965.

45
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.990
So for the first 20 years of operation, we produced these heavy isotopes,

46
00:02:47.991 --> 00:02:50.660
small quantities, but we produced a very regularly.

47
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.230
We operated very regularly and we operated often,

48
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.880
meaning the total number of days we operated over the year was very,

49
00:02:58.881 --> 00:03:02.830
very large, 75%. Now we operate much,

50
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:06.400
much less about 50% of the year we actually operate. Um,

51
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.620
and our mission has shifted over the decades.

52
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.060
Now our mission is neutron scattering, uh, condensed matter physics,

53
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.910
but we still have an isotope component. We still make isotopes.

54
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.750
So we got a big window. This is our Bay. Uh,

55
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.310
our reactor is actually, uh, to the right side of the pool.

56
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.880
The yellow bridge has a dam underneath and that, uh,

57
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.810
well that doesn't have a dam today. I can see the dam is out.

58
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.400
The dam is actually moved to the left. We're currently shut down for an outage.

59
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.450
And, uh, but the reactor is in the pool on the right kind of,

60
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.680
you see the stairway going down that stairway goes down to a

61
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.780
platform, basically a grading.

62
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.630
So we can lower that when we have the dam in place,

63
00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:53.530
we can lower that pool and we can actually walk down there and perform, uh,

64
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.230
maintenance and repairs in the pool is the reactor vessel.

65
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.800
We're a pressurized reactor. So we have a very,

66
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:01.660
a sizeable pressure vessel.

67
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.110
And then the reactor core is actually inside of that vessel.

68
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.490
The vessel itself is, um, uh, it's eight feet across.

69
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.470
So what two and a half meters,

70
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.860
but the core inside of the reactor is where all the action happens.

71
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.110
<v 0>This reactor is designed to produce neutrons,</v>

72
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.420
not to produce power.

73
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.460
It's not trying to make electricity like say Chernobyl

74
00:04:26.461 --> 00:04:31.230
reactor was so it's small and it produces the

75
00:04:31.231 --> 00:04:35.790
neutrons at a very high rate. And then it burns out quite quickly.

76
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.490
Each reactor core only lasts at its proper operating

77
00:04:41.491 --> 00:04:45.570
power about 25 days, less than a month.

78
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.520
<v 1>The reason we pressurize it is to increase the boiling point of water so that we</v>

79
00:04:50.521 --> 00:04:55.140
can cool without boiling our reactor because we produce an enormous amount of

80
00:04:55.141 --> 00:04:59.310
heat along with an enormous amount of neutrons. What's the liquids in the pool,

81
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:00.720
plain water,

82
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.680
just out of the tap water you're purified or slightly diminished realized there

83
00:05:04.681 --> 00:05:07.050
are still some minerals in it, but we do demineralize it.

84
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.050
Water is all for cooling. All we're trying to do is remove heat.

85
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.480
We produce a huge number of neutrons in ways that we can explain a million

86
00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:19.440
billion neutrons, 10 to the 15th neutrons, uh,

87
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.240
every second hit a square centimeter. That's just one square centimeter.

88
00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:25.620
It's a huge number of neutrons.

89
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.130
So the pool water is separate from the water that's inside the pressure vessel

90
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.300
and the pool water remains at about 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

91
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.640
The water inside the vessel starts out at about 120 degrees Fahrenheit.

92
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.830
As it passes down through our reactor core,

93
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.020
it raises about 36 degrees Fahrenheit exits at about 156

94
00:05:46.021 --> 00:05:50.760
degrees Fahrenheit, way, way below boiling. This is good for us power reactors.

95
00:05:50.761 --> 00:05:54.690
They want to generate steam, but we don't want steam. Steam would be bad for us.

96
00:05:54.691 --> 00:05:56.190
We would like our water to be liquid.

97
00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.980
It it's blue because there's so much metal in there. It really isn't blue.

98
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.060
And we get that question often, but it's pretty, but, uh,

99
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.570
it's not like there's an additive. So this is a mock-up of our fuel.

100
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.770
Our fuel is different power reactor, you know, uses fuel rods.

101
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.390
We use fuel plates,

102
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.600
but they're arranged in a very strange arrangement for compared to other

103
00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:19.460
research reactors, even, uh,

104
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.280
our fuel is ma is placed in these plates that are in here.

105
00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:26.090
These are curved plates, and we basically have two fuel elements,

106
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:30.680
an outer element, and an inner element. This part in here, which has rods.

107
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.770
These are not fuel rods. These are target rods.

108
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.550
This area is a area of very high neutron flux.

109
00:06:37.551 --> 00:06:40.640
So this is the business end of our reactor for making isotopes.

110
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.490
When we make California in two 52,

111
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.320
which you may have learned about next door or berkelium two 49, uh,

112
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.300
we make it in here in the flux trap.

113
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.540
<v 0>The main point of the reactor is to have a tube in the middle in</v>

114
00:06:55.541 --> 00:06:59.320
which you put your samples in fairly long,

115
00:06:59.321 --> 00:07:04.150
thin essentially metal test tubes to be radiated and

116
00:07:04.151 --> 00:07:08.530
neutrons are important because these heavy elements can be

117
00:07:08.531 --> 00:07:12.490
formed by bombarding lighter elements with

118
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.020
neutron.

119
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.780
<v 1>These, uh, fuel elements are mostly aluminum,</v>

120
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.760
but inside of these fuel plates is uranium. So we have, uh,

121
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.740
you, uh, we use U three Oh eight, which is uranium oxide, and, uh,

122
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.910
it's sandwiched in between two aluminum plates. So we,

123
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.730
we basically protect the uranium,

124
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.320
but allow it to cool very effectively by having these very small channels to

125
00:07:38.321 --> 00:07:39.670
force the water through.

126
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:44.860
And that's why we raise temperature from one 20 to one 56. It all,

127
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.100
all that heat transfer happens through these plates.

128
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.330
So the plates themselves are about 24 inches, but the, the,

129
00:07:52.331 --> 00:07:56.410
we call the fuel meat. The uranium is really about 20 inches tall,

130
00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:00.970
so about 20 inches of fuel meat. And, uh, and the rest is aluminum.

131
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.480
Our fuel actually the uranium comes from, uh,

132
00:08:04.481 --> 00:08:06.430
the wide 12 national security complex,

133
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:10.930
and we get our uranium for free. However,

134
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:16.000
the free part is a metal chunks and we can't use metal chunks in our fuel.

135
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.780
So we have to pay to have our uranium converted to U three Oh eight oxide.

136
00:08:19.781 --> 00:08:22.510
So Y 12 does that, they convert it to an oxide.

137
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:27.250
And then our fuel is actually fabricated at, uh, BWX T technologies,

138
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.990
which is a, in Lynchburg, Virginia.

139
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.950
They are the ones that take that [inaudible] and they blend it with aluminum

140
00:08:32.951 --> 00:08:36.040
powder and they form these compacts,

141
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:39.250
basically the [inaudible] and the aluminum are blended together.

142
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.410
They press it into these compacts.

143
00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:45.430
These compacts are then put into this aluminum picture frame.

144
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:50.080
So now you can envision there's uranium. There's aluminum in this,

145
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:53.380
in these middle sections here, and this is just all aluminum.

146
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.130
And then we sandwich with an aluminum plate.

147
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.950
Then we take that plate and we roll it out.

148
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:03.270
Then what they do is they form it into this shape. And this is a unique shape.

149
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.620
This shape is called an involute shape. What makes that shape unique?

150
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:12.330
It's the only geometric shape that you can stack around a

151
00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:16.350
circle and maintain a constant water gap thickness.

152
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:19.590
You can't do that with a circle. You can't do it with anything else. It's,

153
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.560
it's an, uh, this involute shape.

154
00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:28.010
<v 2>Here on this dummy version. I'm looking at these are representing the, feel,</v>

155
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:31.850
the uranium, these like this, this like pretty fluted area.

156
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:35.930
<v 1>Yep. Right? Yep. Both these flooded areas are where the uranium is.</v>

157
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:40.130
That's where we generate all of our power, our, all of our heat, all of our, uh,

158
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:40.910
neutrons.

159
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:45.560
<v 2>And how are you making sure that most of the nutrients go to the center where</v>

160
00:09:45.561 --> 00:09:48.290
you want them? I assume you want them to go to the center more than the outside.

161
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:52.040
<v 1>Well, you can't really control that. However, that's the,</v>

162
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:56.300
that's the amazing part of this unique design that Dick Sheverton came up with

163
00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:00.290
is this flux trap. He called it a trap,

164
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:04.280
but it's really just a high concentration. There's no such thing as trap.

165
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:08.090
You can't trap a neutron, but you can create a high density of neutrons.

166
00:10:08.091 --> 00:10:12.260
And that's basically what this does. However, those neutrons do go outward too.

167
00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.300
And in fact, if we look at this mock-up,

168
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:20.510
this gives us a more complete picture of the, uh, of the reactor core.

169
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.290
So we have our flux trap that we saw over there. We have our fuel,

170
00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.220
we have a small region called our control region,

171
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:33.020
and then we have a reflector region. So these are all annular regions,

172
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:38.030
our reflector region, this is necessary for the reactor to work.

173
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:39.590
And so as our control region,

174
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.510
the reflector is made of brilliant and beryllium is a unique material.

175
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:45.883
It's unique.

176
00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:50.270
Neutronic only because when a neutron hits beryllium on average,

177
00:10:50.271 --> 00:10:51.380
about two and a half,

178
00:10:51.381 --> 00:10:56.360
new neutrons are made from that they're lower energy than the ones

179
00:10:56.361 --> 00:10:59.690
that came in and hit it. But so you get two and a half neutrons.

180
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:04.520
Some of those neutrons go back into the fuel and cause that fuel division more,

181
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.920
and you build up this population of neutrons.

182
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:11.510
Some of them can be used for experiments that are out here in the core

183
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:13.123
and the reflector.

184
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.090
<v 2>You just let your dislike,</v>

185
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.850
we've got this great nutrient environment and scientists like,

186
00:11:16.851 --> 00:11:19.100
what else can we Chuck in there to see what happens? Yeah.

187
00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.440
<v 1>Yeah. So in fact, out here,</v>

188
00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:25.850
what we generally make these days is we make plutonium two 38 for now.

189
00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:27.013
<v 2>Awesome.</v>

190
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:34.580
<v 1>So we start with neptunium two 37 and we</v>

191
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:38.840
irradiate those neptunium target for three of our operating cycles,

192
00:11:38.841 --> 00:11:42.140
which is about 25 days. So 75 days of radiation,

193
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.170
and we convert about 10% of that.

194
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.200
Neptunium two 37 to plutonium, two 38.

195
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.320
Then we take it to the hot cells next door that you just visited.

196
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.620
They extract that they ship it out to Los Alamos and

197
00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:00.340
eventually it ends up in, uh, radio thermal electric generators.

198
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:04.120
RTGS for example, like the one that's on Mars Rover curiosity,

199
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.580
or the one that's going to be on Mars, 2020 Rover.

200
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:10.620
<v 0>Between the core and the reflector.</v>

201
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.240
There are plates containing the element. You wrote him.

202
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:21.000
One of the rare earth you roped him in this context is a very efficient

203
00:12:21.001 --> 00:12:25.050
absorber of neutrons. So it stops the nutrients from the core,

204
00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:30.240
getting to the reflector and the control plates are in two parts so

205
00:12:30.241 --> 00:12:35.070
that you can move one up and one down and adjust the size of the gap

206
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:38.700
between them. So when you're ready to go,

207
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:42.990
everything is assembled. The reactor is in its case,

208
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:47.610
in water for the cooling and everything is shielded.

209
00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:52.290
Then remotely, you can pull these control plates apart.

210
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:56.640
<v 1>And the outer one moves up and the inner one moves down and we create a window</v>

211
00:12:56.641 --> 00:12:59.070
of communication between the fuel and the reflector.

212
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.660
So the new drones can communicate and we build up that population of neutrons.

213
00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:08.730
And then we finally go critical. Then what we'll do is for the remainder,

214
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.140
however long it takes, if it takes 23 days, 25 days, 27 days,

215
00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:16.740
we pull these plates apart until they're all the way out.

216
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:20.070
And once they're completely out and we can't maintain 85 megawatts,

217
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:24.300
we shut it down. But at any point, if you, if you shut the window,

218
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.250
the whole thing would go out with it.

219
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.850
It turns off what's going on in the center where those where the roads are.

220
00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.500
So those targets, we do produce other isotopes.

221
00:13:34.501 --> 00:13:38.640
We make nickel 63. Uh, we make selenium 75.

222
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:41.310
We make, uh, California in two 52.

223
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.670
And then we also make some of these other elements, the,

224
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:48.150
like the berkelium two 49. What are the rods typically made of,

225
00:13:48.151 --> 00:13:49.950
or does that depend on what you're trying to achieve?

226
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:53.400
It depends on what you're trying to achieve, but most of the targets,

227
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:57.780
most of the components in the reactor and especially the targets

228
00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:01.920
are, have a, have a capsule housing made of aluminum.

229
00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.540
So most targets are made of aluminum,

230
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.350
and then they have some material interest in them.

231
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.490
In the case of plutonium, like I discussed,

232
00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:27.480
neptunium two 37 in the case of California, two 52,

233
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.140
we start with heavy Curium, which might be Curium two 46 or cuter.

234
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:35.940
Curium two 48 for selenium 75. We have selenium 74 targets.

235
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.820
So we generally want most,

236
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.260
most of the processes are to capture neutrons, to get to the next isotope.

237
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:47.880
We are fairly full, but we have a regular, uh,

238
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:52.790
routine set of, uh, radiations that we do, particularly for isotope production.

239
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:56.690
But we also do a lot of materials, radiations testing in here.

240
00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:01.010
We have a lot of materials for material science in that core. It's one of these,

241
00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:03.440
it lasts for 25 days when we take it out,

242
00:15:03.441 --> 00:15:08.240
we put a brand new one in each one of these is about 1.8 million us dollars

243
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.330
and it lasts for 25 days. So.

244
00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.930
<v 3>And then what happens? Is it refurbed or was that guys in the, in the band?</v>

245
00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:18.280
<v 1>So what happens is, so, as I said, we're in an outage, this is a temporary,</v>

246
00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:21.670
you just a little cap to cover. So we don't drop things in there. Uh,

247
00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:25.390
this is our vessel head. This is the part that's about eight feet in diameter.

248
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.950
Uh, this is the grading.

249
00:15:26.951 --> 00:15:30.610
You can see that you can actually walk down the steps to get to not a lot to see

250
00:15:30.611 --> 00:15:33.130
here because we're not operating. Usually when we're operating,

251
00:15:33.131 --> 00:15:36.250
you could see a blue glow, you get the shrink off radiation glow.

252
00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:38.650
<v 3>So you slide the core into that area. Yes.</v>

253
00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:41.110
<v 1>So the it's actually quite deep down in there.</v>

254
00:15:41.111 --> 00:15:45.220
So we use very long tools attached to things and the operators, uh,

255
00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:49.600
roll the bridge over and then they can lower the fuel down into the corner.

256
00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.540
<v 3>She said it was an exciting day for you guys. Like does everyone come out?</v>

257
00:15:52.541 --> 00:15:53.890
And what she gave was starting a new window.

258
00:15:55.710 --> 00:16:00.340
<v 1>I will say, it's fairly routine. Now putting it in, uh,</v>

259
00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:04.330
taking it out is more exciting, but generally that happens overnight.

260
00:16:04.331 --> 00:16:07.630
So not a lot of people come out overnight, but when you take it out,

261
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:13.090
you take out elements that look like, uh, you get the nice saran, cough,

262
00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:17.830
glow. We don't have a lot of them right now that are glowing. Um, but,

263
00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.520
and actually we, I don't really see many glowing. Usually we would have,

264
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:23.980
these would be glowing, but they've been out for quite a while.

265
00:16:23.981 --> 00:16:26.560
We've had a long outage, so they've had time to decay.

266
00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.710
So these are old ones cooling down. These are old ones cooling down.

267
00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:20.290
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

268
00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:24.280
<v 1>I always stay under water and they stay in this center section of the pool for</v>

269
00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:28.450
maybe two or three years. And then eventually they go over to these racks,

270
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.020
which are three tier. So we can hold a lot of elements over here.

271
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.790
And then eventually they get shipped to Savannah river site where Savannah river

272
00:17:36.791 --> 00:17:41.170
site will dissolve them and extract out the good remaining

273
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:46.060
material and recycle that into a program that's

274
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:50.640
supposedly makes power reactor fuel, not very familiar with that.

275
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:55.140
<v 3>Program. How do you get the stuff out that you've just made? Like, you know,</v>

276
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:58.500
all that, all those cool isotypes that everyone's dying to get their hands on.

277
00:17:58.501 --> 00:18:03.180
How do you get them out of the core and all those surrounding little cylinders?

278
00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.630
<v 1>So that's, that is a challenge.</v>

279
00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:10.340
And I will say that is what our operators do. Um,

280
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.000
with long tools, it's like laparoscopic surgery to get these out.

281
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.370
So it would be nice.

282
00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:21.590
And you look at the top of this and you see these plugs and holes,

283
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:24.200
those plugs and holes. Initially you think, Oh,

284
00:18:24.201 --> 00:18:27.890
those line up with the holes that are on top of the reflector, but they don't.

285
00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.540
The reflector is actually only about this diameter.

286
00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:36.020
Everything we do has to go through this one hatch.

287
00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:39.620
So they're working down there and they're going around things with these long

288
00:18:39.621 --> 00:18:43.640
tools. It's arduous, it's difficult, but they've, they're very talented at it.

289
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:48.800
So it is difficult to get things out, but we do, we do it routinely every cycle,

290
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:53.450
and then they literally take them and they just keep them under water.

291
00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.720
They drag them across to the other side of the pool, and then we can, uh,

292
00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:59.210
we can store them. We can put them in shipping casks,

293
00:18:59.211 --> 00:19:01.870
and then we can ship them over to the hot cells or wherever they're going to.

294
00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:55.963
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

295
00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:03.200
<v 1>Fuel elements while they're not producing. Neutrons are many neutrons.</v>

296
00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.770
They are still producing a tremendous amount of gamma radiation.

297
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:08.840
So we use these, uh,

298
00:20:08.841 --> 00:20:13.730
we have developed a small canister that can go down into that flux trap area.

299
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.880
And we can, uh, fill that canister.

300
00:20:16.881 --> 00:20:21.110
We can stream water or electricity or whatever we want into that canister we can

301
00:20:21.111 --> 00:20:24.560
do. High-intensity gamma radiation. These are our control plates.

302
00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:27.890
You can see that I described the two cylinders. Okay.

303
00:20:27.891 --> 00:20:30.230
That was a little bit of a stretch. They are two cylinders,

304
00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.020
but the inner cylinder is one contiguous cylinder.

305
00:20:33.021 --> 00:20:35.780
The outer cylinder is actually made up of four plates.

306
00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.350
And you can see one of these plates here on the window sill. That's, uh,

307
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:44.330
an example of a control plate. These are very difficult to fabricate it,

308
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:47.060
take a tremendous amount of time. They are very expensive.

309
00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:52.150
Remember these have europium oxide inside as a meat. And, uh,

310
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:56.800
they take two years to fabricate a set like this. So when we do shipments,

311
00:20:56.801 --> 00:21:01.750
we can actually back a truck in here and it comes right over to this area where

312
00:21:01.751 --> 00:21:03.250
these gray squares are.

313
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.840
And we can use the big crane and bring the big shipping cask and set it down.

314
00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:12.820
The shipping cask for California, two 52 targets is quite large.

315
00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:18.220
It's a nine foot diameter sphere that they've painted white and call the cue

316
00:21:18.221 --> 00:21:22.180
ball. It weighs 25 tons. So it's not, it's not insignificant.

317
00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:25.090
And it can get set onto a truck.

318
00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.720
Very exciting when they ship California and plutonium targets are shipped in the

319
00:21:28.721 --> 00:21:30.490
same, in the same cask.

320
00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:35.640
<v 0>I was really impressed that they're using this reactor for</v>

321
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:40.500
all sorts of different experiments, not just making the new elements.

322
00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:45.630
They also have beamlines coming out from the

323
00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:49.350
reactor generating beams of neutron.

324
00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.740
<v 1>The reactor core is that way the beam,</v>

325
00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:56.250
you can see the red lines designate three beam lines.

326
00:21:56.251 --> 00:21:59.280
There's actually a fourth one on the far, right? It doesn't get a red line.

327
00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:02.820
So we have four beam lines that come down and they actually get split even

328
00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:05.190
further because we have more than four instruments out here.

329
00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:07.970
So these large tanks are called sands tanks.

330
00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:10.710
Small-angle neutron scattering tanks. They get evacuated.

331
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:14.640
There's a detector plate, the large one meter square detector plate inside.

332
00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:18.990
<v 0>And they can use the beams of neutrons for what's called neutron</v>

333
00:22:18.991 --> 00:22:20.010
diffraction,

334
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:24.390
which will allow you to do all sorts of interesting experiments.

335
00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:29.700
The one that really excited me was that you can take a diesel engine

336
00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:30.990
like for a car,

337
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:36.510
and you can image that fuel being squirted into the

338
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:41.550
engine block by signing neutrons through the block of a running engine.

339
00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:46.890
And because the fuel contains hydrogen atoms,

340
00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.410
which absorb nutrients strongly,

341
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:53.430
you can see this jet of fuel going into names.

342
00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:57.900
And when it's running without disturbing any of the

343
00:22:58.050 --> 00:22:59.370
workings of the engine.

344
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:04.350
<v 2>Have you seen our new periodic videos website yet? We made it with Wix,</v>

345
00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:07.950
which is the sponsor of today's episode. This is what it looks like.

346
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:11.910
And if you're creating a new website or maybe ditching an old one,

347
00:23:11.911 --> 00:23:13.860
because it's become a nightmare to maintain,

348
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.050
then you really should have a look at Wix.

349
00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:20.880
Their drag and drop interface makes designing a website. So simple, elegant.

350
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:22.710
It's actually kind of fun too.

351
00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:26.880
You can stick pretty close to their huge range of templates to get things going.

352
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:29.640
Or you can go really deep with customization,

353
00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:32.040
tweaking every tiny little part of the site.

354
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:35.310
You can even customize things I didn't know, existed on our website.

355
00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:36.330
They've got everything,

356
00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:41.400
go to wix.com/go/periodic videos use that slash

357
00:23:41.401 --> 00:23:43.440
periodic videos. So they know you came from here,

358
00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.890
whatever you're doing these days, you really should have a website.

359
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.290
And Wix is the place to go to make it

360
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:52.063
wix.com/go/periodic videos.

361
00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:56.450
Wal-Mart is in the middle of South Australia.

362
00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:59.150
Wilmer is actually an Aboriginal word profiling device.

363
00:23:59.151 --> 00:24:02.060
And that's how they appropriately cause launching rockets and things. Yeah,

364
00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:04.610
the black stump. So here they are taking all their supplies.

365
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:08.710
<v 4>Australian service, men and scientists pay the big pot in the operation,</v>

366
00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:10.690
which included the construction of a tire.

367
00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:14.560
The tire that vanished instantly when the atomic weapon was exploded on it.
