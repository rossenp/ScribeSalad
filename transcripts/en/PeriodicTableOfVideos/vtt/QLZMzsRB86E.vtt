00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.320
<v 0>Recently we had the video about gallium and radio</v>

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.130
activity, and several of you in your comments,

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.350
and one viewer culminates in an email pointed out that I had

4
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:17.880
completely missed a really good connection between gallium and

5
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:18.810
plutonium.

6
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.670
And that gallium was really important for making atom bombs.

7
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.740
This came as quite a surprise to me because if you look at the shelves behind

8
00:00:28.741 --> 00:00:32.820
me, there are quite a few books on atom bombs,

9
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.740
mostly on the history,

10
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.270
but I'd never even realized that gallium was important.

11
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.880
And it's only important in the bombs that contain plutonium,

12
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.980
such as the one called fat man that was tragically dropped on the city of

13
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:50.910
Nagasaki.

14
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.420
<v 1>10 58, the morning of August 9th,</v>

15
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.260
the bomb was exploded above the city and in the towering mushroom,

16
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.060
Japan could rate its doom.

17
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.730
<v 0>And the problem is related to the way that atom bombs work</v>

18
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.620
and the way that an atom bomb works is that one

19
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.070
atom of plutonium is hit by a neutron.

20
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.520
It splits into two releasing energy,

21
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.070
and it produces two neutrons,

22
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.140
each of which go on to react or to split other

23
00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:25.580
atoms of plutonium.

24
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.980
So you'll get to chain reaction and the explosion just

25
00:01:30.981 --> 00:01:32.390
builds up and up and up.

26
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.920
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

27
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.850
<v 0>No the two problems that you have, if you're building an atom bomb,</v>

28
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.520
the first one is that you have to have enough plutonium so

29
00:01:49.521 --> 00:01:53.990
that if a neutron comes out of the first plutonium atom,

30
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.820
it will hit another plutonium atom before it escapes from your lamp

31
00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.720
plutonium.

32
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.850
The second problem is you mustn't have too much plutonium or the

33
00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:09.680
spontaneous radioactive decay could start the bomb exploding

34
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:10.640
before you're ready.

35
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.200
So you have to have a very precise mass of plutonium.

36
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.920
And one of the ways that they get round this,

37
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.810
or they got round this when they were device in this boom was to have a sphere

38
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.340
of plutonium,

39
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.100
which had in the middle two elements beryllium and

40
00:02:31.101 --> 00:02:35.510
polonium, which when you mix them together gives you lots of neutrons,

41
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.500
but the beryllium and polonium was separate in the middle.

42
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.230
And the idea was that the whole of the plutonium was surrounded by

43
00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:47.510
explosive at the right moment,

44
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.460
all of the explosive would go off and the ball of plutonium would be compressed.

45
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.830
It would get denser, the plutonium atoms closer together.

46
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.440
So it was harder for the, to escape. And at the same moment,

47
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.220
the beryllium and polonium would be mixed up together.

48
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.140
And a big number of neutrons would be released to set the thing off. Now,

49
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:15.880
the key point was that the sphere of

50
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.250
plutonium had to be absolutely round because otherwise,

51
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:24.310
when you try to compress it, if it wasn't round,

52
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.080
it would squash into the wrong shape and wouldn't get dense.

53
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.210
And the difficulty is that pure plutonium is very

54
00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:36.550
difficult to make into a shape.

55
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.280
The technique they used was called hot pressing so that you take

56
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.180
heated mold and press it at, I think,

57
00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:51.010
400 degrees centigrade w with pure plutonium,

58
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.020
you get the so-called alpha phase, which when you take the mold apart,

59
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.800
begins to flake off and is not suitable.

60
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.900
It was realized that you could mix the plutonium with a small amount of

61
00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:06.130
another element,

62
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.410
which would change the arrangement of the atoms and the metals so-called

63
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.480
different phase instead of the alpha phase so-called Delta phase,

64
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.760
which was slightly less dense and much easier to mold or

65
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:25.540
to hot press. They began by trying Allie minium.

66
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.360
But the problem with Alli minium was that it could itself become

67
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:34.720
radioactive as plutonium atoms, decayed,

68
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.700
and the radioactive aluminium started giving off neutrons,

69
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.260
which could have caused the whole thing to go off prematurely. In the end,

70
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.730
they went down the periodic table from aluminum minium to gallium

71
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.590
and gallium worked really well. You just needed a small amount of gallium,

72
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.660
bit more than 3%.

73
00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.100
And that was enough to fabricate the sphere in the way you wanted.

74
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.510
<v 3>Mean like cooking professors. It's a bit like putting an ingredient, like,</v>

75
00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:06.930
you know, an egg or something into your cake just to help get the mixture,

76
00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:07.764
right?

77
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.230
<v 0>Yes, I suppose so. And, um,</v>

78
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.440
it's not so much that it's bonding them.

79
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.230
Togethers arranging them in a better form of packing by light your egg.

80
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:20.251
<v 3>Professor,</v>

81
00:05:20.251 --> 00:05:23.850
would the gallium then stay in the plutonium for the life of the bond?

82
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.080
<v 0>Yes, the garlic just stays there. And in fact,</v>

83
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.100
because the density is slightly less, and of course,

84
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.780
as the sphere gets bigger, you can get more on the outside.

85
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:42.060
You can actually get a bit more plutonium in your bomb and it still

86
00:05:42.061 --> 00:05:45.540
be safe or least safe until you let it off.

87
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.070
The other thing is that plutonium itself can oxidize react

88
00:05:56.071 --> 00:05:56.904
with air.

89
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.120
So you have to give it to coating on the outside to stop it reacting with

90
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:05.150
air. And on the first bomb,

91
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.760
the one that was tested in New Mexico,

92
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.460
they put a layer of silver,

93
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.010
which wasn't very satisfactory and subsequently they put the layer of the

94
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:20.210
metal nickel and then the bomb has a whole filter

95
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.000
multilayer of different metals,

96
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.240
and then the explosive to put the whole thing together.

97
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.030
And one of the books that I've got it's called atom bombs has quite a

98
00:06:32.031 --> 00:06:35.720
nice picture inside showing how this is put together.

99
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.390
But the reason for having this ball is this bowl is almost

100
00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:45.710
exactly the size 3.62 inches in

101
00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:50.600
diameter 9.2 centimeters of

102
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:53.360
the core of the Batman bomb.

103
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.940
So it's really not very big.

104
00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.260
And when the bomb actually went off,

105
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.690
the amount of plutonium that split and gave the energy

106
00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:07.340
was only one gram,

107
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.470
the ball of plutonium weighed over six kilos.

108
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:17.090
So just a tiny fraction of that actually caused the explosion.

109
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.830
And presumably the rest of the plutonium was blown all over the place.

110
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.610
Like gallium was an important ingredient,

111
00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:28.030
but it was an important ingredient for the manufacturing of the bowl.

112
00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:31.270
Not for any part of the detonation or explosion or anything.

113
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.960
And according to a website,

114
00:07:34.961 --> 00:07:39.010
I looked at called FH two's about nuclear weapons.

115
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.540
Gallium is still used for making volatile nuclear

116
00:07:43.541 --> 00:07:45.040
weapons professor.

117
00:07:45.041 --> 00:07:47.800
Do you think all these books you're buying and websites you're looking at are

118
00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:50.830
going to get you on some kind of watch list? I hope not,

119
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.900
But I think that they,

120
00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:01.690
the history of the project of the atom bomb is

121
00:08:01.691 --> 00:08:03.100
extremely interesting,

122
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.240
not only for the physics and the chemistry that was involved,

123
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:12.520
but the deep moral question that has always worried me that if

124
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:16.990
I had been a scientist during the second world war,

125
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.290
would I have worked on nuclear weapons.
