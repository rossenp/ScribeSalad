00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.290
<v 0>In July,</v>

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.870
a very famous inorganic chemist professor

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.020
lo Jack Lewis died.

4
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.780
And he's actually the only chemist that I

5
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:20.730
know who's become a Lord for those of you who are not in

6
00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:21.564
the UK.

7
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.490
Lord is a member of the upper house of parliament and

8
00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:30.150
people are not elected as a Lord, but they made the Lord.

9
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.020
If it's felt that they can really contribute to the governing of the country.

10
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.670
So it's a real honor.

11
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.850
Jack Lewis was an undergraduate and

12
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.080
a PhD student here in Nottingham.

13
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.060
So we're very proud that he did his first chemistry here.

14
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.700
And as you probably know,

15
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.270
we keep record cards for all our students.

16
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.430
So here is Jack his record card with a

17
00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:03.120
photo of him as he was as an undergraduate.

18
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.530
He started here as a student in the session,

19
00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:12.030
1946 to 47. So that was a year before I was born.

20
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.910
And what I think is interesting is that if you look at his

21
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:18.744
marks,

22
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.820
he did really well in organic chemistry and even in his final

23
00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:27.840
year, although he became a famous inorganic chemist,

24
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.920
his organic chemistry was better once he got his dog,

25
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.570
his first degree is BSC and it says special first

26
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:41.070
class. I have no idea what that means, but I'm sure it's really good.

27
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.600
And he got that in 1949. And then he did a doctorate,

28
00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:48.720
a PhD here in 1952,

29
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.900
and we have his PhD thesis,

30
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.730
which is the reaction of liquid dinitrogen

31
00:01:56.731 --> 00:02:01.590
tetroxide with metals dinitrogen tetroxide

32
00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:05.280
is an oxide of nitrogen and 2 0 4.

33
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.250
And it is a really topical compound because

34
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.350
the Rosetta spacecraft,

35
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.450
which on August the sixth that's today is making its

36
00:02:18.451 --> 00:02:21.360
rendezvous with the, um,

37
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.760
comment in space.

38
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.040
And it is using enter four as the propellant or the oxidizer

39
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.580
in its motors for the final maneuvering.

40
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.260
And the work that was done by Jack Lewis was looking at how

41
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.850
metals react within to fall when he was working.

42
00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:46.440
It wasn't known that into a full would be really good rocket propellant,

43
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.510
but he was laying the basis of what later became

44
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.470
the study of the corrosion of the pipes in rockets.

45
00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.880
And the reason why on Rosetta, when they fired the rockets,

46
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.440
the pipes wouldn't be blocked is because of chemistry that was started by

47
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.113
Jack Lewis.

48
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:11.340
<v 1>[Inaudible] this.</v>

49
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.320
<v 0>Thesis is surprisingly fat it's partly because it is</v>

50
00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:21.060
included some of his publications after working

51
00:03:21.061 --> 00:03:25.320
here, he worked to the Tomic energy research establishment at Harwell,

52
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.320
and then he became an associate lecturer in Sheffield.

53
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.880
He moved around from several,

54
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.180
several universities ending up as professor in Cambridge,

55
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.820
which is where I met him in Cambridge.

56
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.860
He did both distinguished chemistry and also he

57
00:03:40.861 --> 00:03:42.960
was the founding head,

58
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.880
the so-called warden of one of the latest colleges in

59
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.840
Cambridge, the Robinson's college. And really,

60
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.460
I think he became a Lord as a result of his political and

61
00:03:56.461 --> 00:04:01.290
administrative experience in developing the college and its role as the center

62
00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:02.124
of science.

63
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.110
But let me just tell you a little bit about the science he did in Cambridge.

64
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.320
He was working with compounds that were compounds between

65
00:04:13.321 --> 00:04:17.970
metals and carbon monoxide and particularly compounds that had a lot of

66
00:04:17.971 --> 00:04:19.440
metal atoms in them.

67
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.870
And he tried to get bigger and bigger clusters of

68
00:04:24.871 --> 00:04:27.720
metals. This was so-called cluster compounds.

69
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.760
And I think eventually he got one that was sort of had really quite a

70
00:04:32.761 --> 00:04:37.590
large number of atoms, looked a bit like a tetrahedron like this one.

71
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.080
And the idea behind his research

72
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.940
was to try and understand how these clusters of metal

73
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.560
effected the reactivity of molecules that were bonded to the metals,

74
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.030
perhaps as a model for working out what happens in

75
00:04:57.031 --> 00:05:01.800
catalysts and catalytic reactions. He was a very nice person.

76
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.110
And what was really good was that he was very kind to people

77
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.030
who were greatly his junior a few days after he died.

78
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.290
I got an email from one of his former students.

79
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.220
Who's now working in Germany who wrote me,

80
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.540
Jack Lewis is the person who has most influenced my career,

81
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.400
but more significantly my way of approaching a scientific problem and thinking

82
00:05:29.401 --> 00:05:33.900
about chemistry in general, having been an early riser throughout my life,

83
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.370
I used to be the only group member in the lab before 8:00 AM

84
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.920
and would see Jack almost every day. About that time when he,

85
00:05:43.921 --> 00:05:45.960
who came to the department even earlier,

86
00:05:45.961 --> 00:05:50.730
would take his first break to discuss chemistry and other matters with him.

87
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.860
We've stayed in close contact after my PhD and wrote each other more than a

88
00:05:55.861 --> 00:05:59.810
hundred letters. Most of which I've kept since then.

89
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.640
And I think that's a terrific tribute to somebody who's a senior

90
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:07.400
professor interacting with a student.

91
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.930
I should say that when I was a student,

92
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.180
I had quite a large car so-called Woolslair

93
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.060
1800 and much to my embarrassment.

94
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.770
Jack Lewis had the same car. I'm not sure that he drove himself.

95
00:06:25.771 --> 00:06:27.660
I think it was his wife that drove.

96
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.030
So I had to sneak into the car park and hope that nobody would notice that I,

97
00:06:33.031 --> 00:06:36.120
as a students had the same car, I was embarrassed.

98
00:06:36.121 --> 00:06:39.420
It was a little pretentious that the students should have a car like that.
