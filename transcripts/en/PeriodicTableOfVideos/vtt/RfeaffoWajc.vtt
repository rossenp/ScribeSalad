1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.680
<v 0>I've never, never seen it do that before.</v>

2
00:00:01.681 --> 00:00:04.950
I normally either shatters or it just about holds, but I've never seen a,

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.110
a Holy experiment like this

4
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.590
gonna show you an organic metallic.

5
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.810
So organic metallic just means that there's carbon bonded to a metal on metal.

6
00:00:17.811 --> 00:00:19.070
Today is Allah minium.

7
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.700
And we're going to take the single simplest carbon containing unit,

8
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.170
which is a methyl group, H three. So try me fella.

9
00:00:27.171 --> 00:00:30.740
Minium is actually the world's largest tonnage, organic metallic.

10
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.330
It's quite hard to get accurate numbers, but it's at least 10,000 tons per year.

11
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.810
And you think, Hey, that's a useful compound. It could,

12
00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:40.490
we should be able to do some chemistry with that,

13
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.710
both in the lab and on industrial scale.

14
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.900
But unfortunately the compound has one or two, uh, problems, uh,

15
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.340
associated with it.

16
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.640
And we're going to show you that by attempting to try and weigh out some

17
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.560
trimethyl Ella minium in air.

18
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.490
So I've got a syringe here and we've got it contained within this canister.

19
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.390
I'm wearing gloves for reasons that will become fairly obvious.

20
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.620
So there's going to be a little bit of faffing around here while we get this

21
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.630
opened up in a safe way and thrilling this syringe full of an inert

22
00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:14.000
gas we're using are gone today.

23
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.930
Argon is completely unreactive. I'll just turn that sound off.

24
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.410
So I flushed the syringe three times with argon.

25
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.700
Now that should mean that we can pick up some trimethyl Ella minium with

26
00:01:25.701 --> 00:01:26.870
comparative safety.

27
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.980
So we go down into this canister and I'm just going to take her.

28
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.240
<v 1>A little bit, and then I'm going to pull this up.</v>

29
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.330
<v 0>Now, there may be a slight flame as this comes out the end. There it is. Right.</v>

30
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.010
So why can't you weigh out? Try menthol, Ella minium in air. Well,

31
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.110
let's have a look. Here's some in air

32
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.530
and as you can see the compounds spontaneously catching fire as we dump it.

33
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.341
And in fact,

34
00:01:55.341 --> 00:01:59.900
I've put about two grams of trimethyl Allah minium there that's burning with

35
00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:04.370
about the same energy as a one bar electric fire at about the same rate.

36
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.100
And so you've heard the glass crack there.

37
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.870
That's the energy coming out of there. So the trimethyl Ella minium, uh,

38
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.830
has a very weak carbon to alpha minium bond. The bonds,

39
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.890
the alpha minium forms with oxygen are incredibly strong.

40
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.630
So we're getting a massive transfer of methyl to a burnt flame.

41
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.280
And I think if I pick this up,

42
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.260
you can see this is now the severely damaged and that's due to the heat that

43
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.550
was merely generated by turning all of those weak carbon

44
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.090
Alemanian bonds into really strong carbon oxygen bonds.

45
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.460
So you can see a little bit of aluminum oxide left.

46
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.920
That's the same as you would find, I guess,

47
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.480
in a variety of grinding powders or indeed in common

48
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.860
abrasives. It was the extreme heat when we reached about 500 degrees,

49
00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:56.540
C the thermal shock on the ground glass cracked. So, uh,

50
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.030
I don't know about you, uh, viewers today,

51
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.980
whether you'd like to weigh that out in air without special precautions.

52
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.330
Here's the compound, uh, in air, we're just going to release this slowly.

53
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.460
We're going to see a bright yellow flame and oxidation. So going on one,

54
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.070
three, two, one,

55
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.533
okay.

56
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.310
[inaudible] is actually a critical additive in making the

57
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.870
polymerization of the monomers that are bound in our

58
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.730
modern society. So the next time you pick up a plastic shopping bag or a, uh,

59
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.570
uh, a black refuse sack or a piece of plastic Tupperware,

60
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.170
there's a good job that that's come from a catalytic process.

61
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.860
We'll have involved one of the other metals in the periodic table to Tanium,

62
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.690
but that will be completely in, uh,

63
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.360
until we start to mix in some trimethyl Ella minium.

64
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.860
So it's what is known as a co promoter. So if you encounter polypropylene,

65
00:04:46.861 --> 00:04:48.870
you can see that on the back of your recycling thing,

66
00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:53.070
you'll see P P is a good chance that that's come out of an alpha minium promoted

67
00:04:53.071 --> 00:04:56.640
capitalist. You just showed me what to ground. It looks like,

68
00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.120
how does industry do with tons and tons of it? Well,

69
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.720
you gotta be pretty careful. And you saw that we had a metal canister here.

70
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.340
It's sealed, it's under all gone. So you need to pipe this liquid around. Uh,

71
00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:11.280
you need to build specialist operators, specialist, plants,

72
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.760
and they can cost many millions of euros or pounds or dollars,

73
00:05:14.761 --> 00:05:17.220
whatever you would like to put together. Uh,

74
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.680
so there's a great lot of this material,

75
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.700
but it's remarkably under utilized in many other chemical applications.

76
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.100
<v 2>Four three, two one zero</v>

77
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.390
one zero one zero

78
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.080
launch of the first carrier, improved a Ryan to ROA after

79
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.670
you see it on your screen.

80
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.250
<v 0>So about 10 years ago, we set ourselves the challenge of saying,</v>

81
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.350
can we develop a stabilized version of trimethylamine that's able

82
00:06:14.351 --> 00:06:18.400
to be worked with by, uh, uh, still experienced chemist,

83
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.210
but not without the, the, uh, rather profound danger that we've already seen.

84
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.800
So what we're going to show you now. So an identical watch glass. Yeah.

85
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.340
Here's our compound that we developed, uh, about 10 years ago.

86
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.330
This is now marketed commercially, this tri Meetha Alemanian.

87
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.920
So there's the bit we've already seen.

88
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.780
And then it's got this Diazo by site clue to, to,

89
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.410
to octane Adam. And that sucks so much of a mouthful.

90
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.880
We just call this compound Dabao cause that's much easier to say if you remember

91
00:06:48.881 --> 00:06:51.940
the flames, you should be worried when I'm going to take the top off here.

92
00:06:51.941 --> 00:06:55.360
And I can see a little bit of the fear in your eyes, but if you see here now,

93
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.260
well, it's a whole new ballgame just by making the adduct.

94
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.580
Instead of having a liquid, we've got a white powder,

95
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.310
it's crystalline, it's free flowing.

96
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.990
I'm only going to put a little bit down here,

97
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.920
cause I kind of don't want my watch glass to crack, but as you can see,

98
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.140
even if you are a relatively inexperienced,

99
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.300
so that's much easier to work with now, although this is kinetically stabilized,

100
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:24.120
it's still got all of the potential power to make those very strong alum,

101
00:07:24.121 --> 00:07:28.180
minium to oxygen bonds for this one, I'm going to give it a little bit of fuel.

102
00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:31.900
So I'm going to cheat by taking a little bit of tissue.

103
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.050
This tissue happens to be blue as opposed to your normal white tissue,

104
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.060
but I'm going to move that out the way.

105
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:41.380
And so I guess that looks okay about a spoonful.

106
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.880
I'm going to put it on the paper like so, so again,

107
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.820
no major action. Thank you, Darren, for that,

108
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.690
we've need to get just the right amount of water in it to initiate directions.

109
00:07:52.691 --> 00:07:53.980
I'm just putting a few drops.

110
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.090
And what I'm hoping is that that will run through the Hilary. There you go.

111
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.910
So we do get a fire out of it,

112
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.660
but I guess you probably could manage with that fire.

113
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.620
And it's nowhere near the same horrific quantity of energy.

114
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:12.370
You can see getting very hot in the middle. So I strongly advise you to, uh,

115
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.710
to not do this on the end of your finger,

116
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:18.760
because it would cause severe burns three, two, one.

117
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:20.283
<v 3>Okay.</v>

118
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.050
<v 0>And I'll be cleaning those line afterwards.</v>

119
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.060
So the black search you can see is actually the, uh,

120
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:35.440
carbon that's been produced in the flying process.

121
00:08:35.441 --> 00:08:38.380
So we've oxidized up to carbon dioxide,

122
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:43.090
but we also produced a little bit of graphite that I that's unusual, actually.

123
00:08:43.091 --> 00:08:44.860
I've not noticed that before. So,

124
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.850
but we don't normally spray the stuff around the lab for obvious safety reasons.

125
00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.670
<v 3>[Inaudible] yeah. You just have to clean it up.</v>
