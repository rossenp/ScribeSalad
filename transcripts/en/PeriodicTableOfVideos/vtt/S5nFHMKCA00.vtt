00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.390
<v 0>Braid has been to America to the Oakridge national lab.</v>

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.250
And he's been through a real treasure trove of elements,

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.300
elements I've never seen. And I'm so you haven't as well.

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.500
Plutonium neptunium, I'm a risk Siham California.

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.390
That's going to be used to make element 119 and lots more.

6
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.370
So I'm going to take you on the Safari through these elements so you can

7
00:00:26.371 --> 00:00:30.780
see them just like I've seen them for the first time for a Safari.

8
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:31.920
You need the guide.

9
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.530
And our guide is a really experienced chemist Rose bowl.

10
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.660
I'm amazed by what she knew.

11
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.160
What was really interesting is that most of these are isotopically pure.

12
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.970
So we began with uranium two, three, four,

13
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.380
the oxide it's black, but it's uranium.

14
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.980
Then the plutonium I've never seen plutonium

15
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.600
except in solution.

16
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.130
And here there was plutonium as an oxide

17
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.993
solid,

18
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.890
but lots of different bottles each with a different isotopically pure

19
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.230
plutonium. These heavy elements have lots of different isotopes.

20
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.670
They had plutonium from two 39 to two 42.

21
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.470
So that's two 39,

22
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.630
two 42 41 to 42 each in a separate

23
00:01:27.631 --> 00:01:28.410
bottle.

24
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.190
I suspect there may be nowhere else in the world that they have samples like

25
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:36.720
that. And then there was a sample of uranium, two, three,

26
00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:41.430
three as a bonus. So there was this line of bottles.

27
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.840
I just couldn't believe it. The neptunium,

28
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.740
which they also showed us is adult powder.

29
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.670
The next sample that Brady was shown was Amaris team two, four,

30
00:01:56.671 --> 00:02:00.600
three, which is really very radioactive.

31
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.580
They got quite excited and they were a bit nervous.

32
00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:09.360
So it was only taken out to its led container very briefly.

33
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.450
<v 1>So how much is that reading?</v>

34
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.610
That's reading about 800 MRR per hour.

35
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.790
That's very hot. Yes.

36
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.860
<v 0>And it has an activity of 800 million reds now,</v>

37
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:25.940
which is a lot,

38
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.010
they had 250 milligrams of this americium it

39
00:02:31.011 --> 00:02:35.690
costs $8,000 to ship one milligram.

40
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.060
So you can work out how much it would cost to ship the lots of this material.

41
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.000
8,000 times, 250.

42
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:45.880
<v 1>You guys are pretty keen to put that away.</v>

43
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.500
<v 0>Most of the oxides at black,</v>

44
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.420
but protactinium oxide is white.

45
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.880
This is protecting him two, three.

46
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.190
<v 1>This is a two to seven sample.</v>

47
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.710
So this one has a 20 year half-life.

48
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.460
<v 0>I was quite taken with the sample back tenure,</v>

49
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.040
partly because we couldn't see it on the video because

50
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.380
it is so radioactive that the radiation has discolored the

51
00:03:22.381 --> 00:03:23.670
glass in the bottle.

52
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.100
So the transparent glass has gone Brown and you can't see what's inside the

53
00:03:29.101 --> 00:03:29.934
bottle,

54
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.530
but you can tell it's there because it's just gone Brown where the sample is,

55
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.490
the sample itself is white, but we can't see it.

56
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.873
<v 1>This.</v>

57
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.100
<v 0>At union with a really nice green,</v>

58
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.780
I suspect the tip was nice, agreed to the naked die.

59
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.220
Then it looked on the video in dilute solution.

60
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.750
It was quite pale, but in a more concentrated solution,

61
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.290
which they only had the tiny amount, it was pretty dark green.

62
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.220
I think it is quite surprising that the salts of these act tonight's

63
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.140
a colored because somehow with all these names at the bottom of the periodic

64
00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:23.190
table, one,

65
00:04:23.191 --> 00:04:27.150
doesn't imagine that some of them might be colored salts,

66
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.740
colored solutions. They sort of simple, boring, and gray,

67
00:04:31.741 --> 00:04:33.270
and you don't really think about them.

68
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.370
But then Rose took Brady to a filing cabinet,

69
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.970
had a lock on it so that people couldn't open it,

70
00:04:41.971 --> 00:04:43.680
except with the combination.

71
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.140
An insight was a whole treasure trove of different samples.

72
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.930
There was technetium 99.

73
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.620
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

74
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.140
<v 0>Hello. Technetium 99.</v>

75
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.330
This is very interesting because technetium has different

76
00:05:03.331 --> 00:05:06.840
isotopes 99, the so-called Mehta stable one,

77
00:05:06.841 --> 00:05:10.920
which is used for medical imaging and this one,

78
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.580
which has a much longer half life, about 20 years.

79
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.020
And so it's quite stable and they can keep it in the drawer for a long time.

80
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.330
So you might ask, first of all,

81
00:05:21.331 --> 00:05:25.950
why do people get so excited about such small samples of

82
00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:30.210
material? And the answer is they're highly radioactive,

83
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.880
so they're very dangerous,

84
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.010
but for the applications such as smoke alarms

85
00:05:38.011 --> 00:05:41.400
with Amaris SIM or treating cancer,

86
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.620
because you only need a few particles to do your job,

87
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.730
you need very, very small amounts of the material.

88
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.130
So a milligram of a chemical normally would be such a small amount

89
00:05:56.131 --> 00:05:57.710
that you could hardly use it.

90
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.360
A milligram of these highly radioactive materials can be

91
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.830
really useful. In fact, for some cancer treatments,

92
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.030
you need only a nanogram. That's a millionth of a milligram.

93
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.220
All these samples have been extracted from material that has been

94
00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:18.830
irradiated in nuclear reactors.

95
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.270
Some of them have been leftover. They are,

96
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.570
if you'd like harvesting it from nuclear waste,

97
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.870
which would otherwise just be stored. Others,

98
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.370
especially made by irradiating a sample

99
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.610
in a very high flux of neutrons.

100
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.540
And then you generate the element you want. In fact,

101
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.420
we're going to show you a really nice video soon,

102
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.820
which shows how these elements are made.

103
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.020
<v 2>This is a plutonium sample. This one is, um,</v>

104
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.490
around 17% for you, two 44.

105
00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:02.140
So it has more plutonium, two 44 than, than most, uh,

106
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:06.700
plutonium samples. This is a lot of plutonium in at this. Uh,

107
00:07:06.701 --> 00:07:10.780
so it's very concentrated in opposed to the neptunium we looked at earlier,

108
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:14.230
if this was more dilute than you would see more of the green color,

109
00:07:14.231 --> 00:07:17.830
but this is a very dark green because of how concentrated this plutonium

110
00:07:17.831 --> 00:07:18.664
material is.

111
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.500
You hold this material up to the glove ports and look at it directly through the

112
00:07:23.501 --> 00:07:26.020
side of the glove port. And it's not through the shield shielding.

113
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.160
You can see the color of the material. The shielding gives everything,

114
00:07:30.161 --> 00:07:35.080
a yellow tent, and that's because of the leaded glass and, uh,

115
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.090
polymer plates that we have.

116
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:43.200
<v 0>I was quite interested in the sample of protactinium because it turns out that</v>

117
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.440
it doesn't dissolve very well. So it looks green nation solution,

118
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.850
but it looks cloudy a bit like a mixture of green ink.

119
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.150
<v 2>This is a holmium one 60 6:00 AM.</v>

120
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.910
Holmium one 66 Mehta stable.

121
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.010
It's a solid and it's and you can tilt it on the side or whatever,

122
00:08:03.011 --> 00:08:06.880
so he can kind of see it. It's got a pinkish color to it helped me.

123
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.880
Oxide is a whitish pink solid.

124
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.910
<v 1>It's much prettier to my eye than it is on the camera.</v>

125
00:08:12.911 --> 00:08:17.770
Like it's a very pretty color that like sort of a salmony. Yeah.

126
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:22.540
How would you describe that color? Rose I've always called it pink.

127
00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:27.370
<v 0>No, the samples that really excited me were California.</v>

128
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:30.640
First of all, there was California two, four nine,

129
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.970
which was again a sort of greenish color.

130
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:38.110
And they were really quite respectful for that. They,

131
00:08:38.111 --> 00:08:42.100
it was very radioactive. They called it very dosing.

132
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.370
<v 1>I got it. I got it.</v>

133
00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:47.950
<v 0>I think that's a really nice word,</v>

134
00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.070
a new scientific term for you they've seen,

135
00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:56.190
but then there was California two, five, two, and five one,

136
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.770
which is the material that is going to be used to make the target in the

137
00:09:01.771 --> 00:09:06.060
experiments to try and synthesize elements 119 and

138
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:09.120
120 in Duke. Now in Russia,

139
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.760
you may remember the time I took you with Brady to Dubner to

140
00:09:14.761 --> 00:09:17.670
see where these new elements are going to be made.

141
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.460
Now you can see what they're going to be made from.

142
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.720
As you know, element one, one,

143
00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:28.770
three Niho Niamh was synthesized in Japan,

144
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.370
Rose produced the sample of Curium two, four eight,

145
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:36.810
which was used to make the targets for

146
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.560
the work in Japan that synthesized [inaudible]. So the targets were, all of

147
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:40.560
 these elements, experiments are being made at the Oak Ridge national lab. And then in a terrific example of international collaboration 

148
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:40.560
of

149
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.393
 being sent all over the world to the accelerators where the elements can be synthesized.

150
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:02.930
<v 2>There's only about 17 milligrams in there, so it's not a lot of material.</v>

151
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:04.790
So it's very hard to see the solid,

152
00:10:04.791 --> 00:10:06.590
but you can tell where it is by the red damage.

153
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:12.080
<v 0>So the final question is why should you be so excited by seeing these things?</v>

154
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:17.750
And the answer is that what you're seeing is a good fraction of

155
00:10:17.751 --> 00:10:20.570
the world's supply of these elements.

156
00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:25.610
You can't ever see all the gold or all the iron in the world,

157
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.580
but here in that lab,

158
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:32.780
there was the maturity of the samples of these elements.

159
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:37.370
There may be one or two other labs in the world that have similar

160
00:10:37.371 --> 00:10:38.204
amounts,

161
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:43.370
but you've seen a really big fraction of the total in

162
00:10:43.371 --> 00:10:45.140
existence of these elements.

163
00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.670
<v 2>Of it later. Some of the material we work with is very highly radioactive.</v>

164
00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.270
And so we need shielding to protect us from the dose that comes from that

165
00:10:53.271 --> 00:10:57.080
material. So we work with it with remote handles.
