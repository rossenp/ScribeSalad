00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.100
<v 0>I'm in Dubna in Russia,</v>

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.180
the birthplace of six super-heavy elements.

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.800
We're on the NAB dish. Men deliver the Mendel life in bank loans.

4
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.150
[inaudible] And here I am next to the stage two of Dmitri Mendeleev.

5
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.070
And what I want to tell you about is the things that I've learnt in the last few

6
00:00:25.071 --> 00:00:28.580
days about the chances of making the super-heavy elements

7
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.550
119 120.

8
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.990
So these are really special because they will begin the eighth period,

9
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.660
the eight throw of, of stable.

10
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.540
Before I came here two days ago,

11
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.780
I thought that that was real questions.

12
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.140
Whether or not it was possible ever to make these elements.

13
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.220
I now realize it's much more a technical problem.

14
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.940
People can see how this should be done,

15
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.540
but they can't quite work out, which is the best way.

16
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.060
So let me try and explain to you the problem,

17
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.890
the real success in the last few years in making elements

18
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.570
113 to 118 has been in the

19
00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:12.710
project tale,

20
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.090
the light atom that has been accelerated towards the target.

21
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.520
And this has been the very rare isotope of calcium, calcium 48,

22
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.700
that has a big excess of neutrons.

23
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.830
The problem is that we have now got to the stage where we have

24
00:01:30.831 --> 00:01:35.210
run out of suitable target materials to make element

25
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.190
119.

26
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.110
You need to have element 99 that's Einstein him is the

27
00:01:42.111 --> 00:01:46.670
target because calcium 20 plus 99 makes

28
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.410
119.

29
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.120
The problem is that Einstein him is a very difficult element to

30
00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:53.930
make.

31
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.670
If the Oak Ridge national laboratory runs a dedicated campaign to

32
00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:02.600
making it, they could make 40 micrograms,

33
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.910
which would cost somewhere between five and $10 million.

34
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.100
And that would be enough to make a target that was only one and a half square

35
00:02:13.101 --> 00:02:13.970
centimeters,

36
00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:18.770
an area much smaller than the current targets that you use for these

37
00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:23.450
experiments. So a whole new technology will have to be developed to stop.

38
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.920
The town gets overheating.

39
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.110
The other approach is to use a different project tile.

40
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.940
There are ideas of using either 51 to Tanium or

41
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.020
54 chromium and the existing targets.

42
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.410
The problem is that with Tanium and chromium,

43
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.660
the chances of the successful collision taking place

44
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.060
are much less than with calcium.

45
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.390
So you need a much more intense beam.

46
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.250
So there's the technical problems choosing your projectile

47
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.600
choosing targets, but assuming you've done that,

48
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.600
where on earth can you do the experiment?

49
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.280
And this is why it's been so exciting being here in Dona because they're

50
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:13.870
building a special new facility with a more intense beam

51
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.400
so that these experiments can be done. And it has a terrific name,

52
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.950
the super heavy element factory,

53
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.040
the building is built or almost built.

54
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.200
And the accelerator is just being assembled Brady and I were really

55
00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:33.880
lucky to Yuri again this year and the person after whom element

56
00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:38.830
118 was named or Gunnison took us for a

57
00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:43.570
private tour round, the new facility, which is still being built.

58
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.790
So at the center is a huge magnet that is going to be used for the

59
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:51.070
cyclotron for the accelerator.

60
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.810
Irons are accelerated whichever project tail day twos

61
00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.180
goes into the space between the poles of the magnet and there's accelerated

62
00:04:01.181 --> 00:04:05.650
round and round in the spiral path from the center to the outside.

63
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.570
And by the time it gets to the outside,

64
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.710
it will be traveling at about a 10th of the speed of light.

65
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.520
And at the moment they've just got the magnet in place.

66
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.820
It weighs 1100 tons.

67
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.160
And at the moment they are measuring the magnetic field to make sure that

68
00:04:24.161 --> 00:04:29.080
the magnet is performing perfectly before they put the actual accelerator

69
00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:33.400
inside, but the accelerator should be up and running by the end of this year,

70
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.630
2017.

71
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.130
So once the irons come out of the accelerator at this huge speed,

72
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.200
they go into a separator,

73
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.460
which is rather like the switching system at a railway junction,

74
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.320
which can send the beam down one of five different beam lines to five

75
00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:51.700
different experiments.

76
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.330
And that in itself is quite a huge piece of equipment,

77
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.170
but most exciting of all Braden,

78
00:04:59.171 --> 00:05:04.030
I would take an into the rooms where the targets are going

79
00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:04.864
to be

80
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.770
with the first visitors in this huge empty room.

81
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.960
And it was really quite moving to think this was where element

82
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.480
119 and 120 may be born. I was particularly fascinated.

83
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.160
They've already drilled the holes in the walls where

84
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.350
the beam is going to come through.

85
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.030
So you can look through this hole and see the atoms I

86
00:05:34.031 --> 00:05:36.610
view of the accelerator, the,

87
00:05:36.611 --> 00:05:39.610
what the target we'll see as the beams are coming towards it.

88
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.530
<v 2>I think this is fantastic. It's completely empty room,</v>

89
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.190
but this is the room where the new elements,

90
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.850
119 hundred and 20 a likely to be made.

91
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.650
<v 0>So five years ago,</v>

92
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.620
we made a video about preliminary experiments trying make

93
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.900
element 120 from titanium and California to Tanium

94
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.000
project tail, California, target, not here in Dubai, but in Germany.

95
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.470
The results were actually slightly more promising than

96
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.500
I realized. When I made that video.

97
00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.710
<v 3>It's not the sort of experiment that will necessarily give you a new</v>

98
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.800
iPhone tomorrow, but on the other hand,

99
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.380
it will give us a lot of scientific understanding.

100
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.600
<v 0>But the rarely important message that I and Brady they've got from this</v>

101
00:06:31.601 --> 00:06:36.190
visit is that things are really quite well on track to make

102
00:06:36.191 --> 00:06:39.160
elements 119 and 120,

103
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:44.110
whether it'll be in two years or five years or 10 years, nobody can tell,

104
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:49.090
but certainly the science is there and we know where

105
00:06:49.091 --> 00:06:52.660
we're going. And it looks really promising.

106
00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.760
<v 3>The two grams of calcium carbonate here, which have worth,</v>

107
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.590
or at least if you wanted to buy,

108
00:07:02.591 --> 00:07:06.820
it would cost you about half a million dollars.

109
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.000
<v 4>So my hands are getting quite cold.</v>
