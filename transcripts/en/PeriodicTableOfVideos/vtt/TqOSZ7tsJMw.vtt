1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 0>So I'm here with my famous chemist and Nobel prize winners.</v>

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.870
Ty Brady gave it to me and we're waiting for the

3
00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:13.710
2015 Nobel prize in chemistry to be announced.

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.110
And as usual I have absolutely no idea who it's going to go

5
00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:22.050
to, which is what makes it really quite fun.

6
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.540
But you remember sometimes it goes to more to biology than to

7
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:31.020
chemistry because there isn't a Nobel prize for biology.

8
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.590
We've already got some chemistry in the medicine prize.

9
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.330
So chemistry has been recognized at least a bit already.

10
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.830
So let's see what happens with chemistry. Are you going to give us a prediction?

11
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.040
I have absolutely no idea who it would be.

12
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.540
Somebody suggested it might be for lithium-ion batteries,

13
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.280
the battery on the mobile phone that you may be watching this on at the moment,

14
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.830
but who knows? It's always the really.

15
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.000
<v 1>[Inaudible] Academy of sciences has decided to award the</v>

16
00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:12.980
2015 Nobel prize in chemistry jointly

17
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.880
to Tumas Lindahl Paul mode,

18
00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:20.000
rich and as is Sanjana.

19
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.213
<v 2>Okay.</v>

20
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.920
<v 0>So I've rushed off and got a DNA model.</v>

21
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.640
I went into the coffee room and asked who'd got one.

22
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.250
The only one I can find is this one,

23
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.530
which is a bit dusty and light the damage DNA in

24
00:01:45.531 --> 00:01:49.430
the Nobel prize. This one's also damaged.

25
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.070
So I went back to the coffee room and got

26
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.830
something a bit more reliable.

27
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.400
These are the spares for the old coffee machine.

28
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.320
Unfortunately, we don't use that coffee machine anymore.

29
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.440
So I'm a bit restricted in what I've got for the model,

30
00:02:09.441 --> 00:02:11.420
but it's enough util understand,

31
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.870
just remember your genetic information,

32
00:02:14.871 --> 00:02:18.980
genetic information of all living things in the world are

33
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.310
transmitted through DNA.

34
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.900
DNA is a molecule that has two chains linked together.

35
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.340
The linkages between the two chains are what carries the genetic

36
00:02:31.341 --> 00:02:36.110
information and can be translated into the

37
00:02:36.111 --> 00:02:40.730
making of proteins in your body. In the Nobel announcement,

38
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.070
the lady who was explaining it said that each of our bodies

39
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.550
has enough DNA, which if it was stretched out,

40
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.710
would go to the sun and back from the earth 250 times.

41
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.810
So that there's an awful lot of it.

42
00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.360
Each time a cell divides the DNA has to be

43
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:06.310
replicated because one pair of chains has to be made into two pairs

44
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:10.420
of chains. One for each of the new sales, when that happens,

45
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.520
mistakes can be made and the chemistry inside ourselves can also

46
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.230
damage the DNA. And this damage happens very quickly,

47
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.070
200 times a day, perhaps for a given cell.

48
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.240
So if there wasn't a mechanism to repair this damage,

49
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.620
then we'd all die. Before we were even born.

50
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.080
Now, Brady,

51
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.180
who is very astute says that really what

52
00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:44.650
this Nobel prize is for is the DNA spellchecker that is

53
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:48.550
correcting mistakes, rather like the spellchecker,

54
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.140
but actually it's better than the spellchecker because I don't know about your

55
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:53.921
spellchecker,

56
00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:58.690
but mine sometimes puts in the completely the wrong word because it misses

57
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:03.330
guesses. What we've done. Now, let me try and explain to you.

58
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.691
And for,

59
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:09.510
I explain it's important to realize that there are lots of different

60
00:04:09.511 --> 00:04:12.300
ways that DNA can be damaged and repaired,

61
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.760
but this is a really high-speed explanation.

62
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.060
And we really need to do a proper video about DNA,

63
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.350
and that will be coming quite soon. I hope, but for the moment,

64
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.400
what happens with DNA is that you have, I have two chains,

65
00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:32.130
which are indicated by this white piece of it plastic.

66
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.150
And in between you have so-called base pairs,

67
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.100
which for this,

68
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.850
I've just indicated the things that pair together arrived,

69
00:04:41.851 --> 00:04:45.600
the lime green or dark green, okay.

70
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.780
It's slightly more complicated, but for this that's enough.

71
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.310
Now the first sort of mistake is that one of the DNA changed.

72
00:04:53.311 --> 00:04:57.390
The one that's rowing could have the wrong pair.

73
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.560
We look at this and this is just a tiny, tiny piece of the DNA chain,

74
00:05:01.561 --> 00:05:05.790
which would go on for miles in either direction. So here you have dark green,

75
00:05:05.791 --> 00:05:09.900
dark green, lime, lime, dark lime. And then here,

76
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.790
there's a mismatch. Now,

77
00:05:11.791 --> 00:05:14.910
if you mentioned that the one on this side is the chain that's growing,

78
00:05:14.911 --> 00:05:19.410
that's being synthesized the way the spell checking works

79
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.980
is that there is, it knows which one is the good,

80
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.420
so it can spot the mistake.

81
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.590
It should have been dark green and it's lime green.

82
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.600
So what happens is that there are enzymes in the mechanism that chops

83
00:05:36.601 --> 00:05:40.170
out the bit that's bad and puts in the new one.

84
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.870
You have to imagine that in the cell,

85
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.660
there are lots of these free things swimming around.

86
00:05:45.661 --> 00:05:48.600
So you can always throw one away and not do another one.

87
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.870
It's just like in theory, at least on your computer,

88
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:56.340
there's an infinite supply of letters. So if you type an O instead of a,

89
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.840
a, you just throw away the Oh, and type another eight.

90
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.070
So the first way is that you can just chop these things out.

91
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.510
There is another sort of mistake where there's a chemical

92
00:06:08.511 --> 00:06:13.280
reaction that damages one of these bases.

93
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.360
And actually for example, turns this into something else which I've done red,

94
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.820
which is for those of you who by chemists is usually

95
00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:24.290
indicated with the letter U.

96
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:28.100
So this one is one that shouldn't be in DNA at all.

97
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.270
So there's another mechanism that was discovered by Thomas Lindo,

98
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.680
where this is chopped out. And the right one is put in, in state.

99
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.990
The final sort of mechanism is the one which is

100
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:46.910
causes or is thought to cause some sorts of skin cancer from the UV

101
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:48.350
light, from the sun.

102
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.540
And this is slightly different where everything is okay in the completed DNA

103
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.890
chain. And then the UV light comes the UV light.

104
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.720
I'm showing with the stapler and it just staples

105
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.970
to two of the bases together. So-called theming.

106
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.710
What it does is the UV light changes one of the theming molecules.

107
00:07:12.711 --> 00:07:14.180
So it reacts with its neighbor.

108
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.750
This only happens where there two of them next to each other.

109
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.850
And of course that messes everything up. But there is a different mechanism,

110
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:27.170
which was discovered by the researchers in the United States,

111
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.810
which chops out this pair,

112
00:07:29.811 --> 00:07:33.620
that to join together and replaces them with two more teas,

113
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.930
which are not joined together. Now,

114
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.700
the importance of all of this is that it's what keeps us

115
00:07:40.701 --> 00:07:44.390
alive. It's understanding the fundamental mechanisms.

116
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:49.340
There are other ways that DNA can be damaged. For example, if you smoke,

117
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.710
some of the chemicals that come out in the cigarette smoke can

118
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:58.430
interact with the DNA and damage the bases.

119
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.380
And there are mechanisms that take this and deal with it. Of course,

120
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.830
smoking has not been around very long.

121
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:11.600
So evolution has not got a special and to smoking

122
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.220
repair mechanism. But what it has done is to have a mechanism,

123
00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:20.330
a generalized mechanism to detect things are wrong and weed them out.

124
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.750
Speaking of DNA damage,

125
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.830
I took this out of my colleague's office while he was giving a lecture,

126
00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:31.270
didn't even ask him.

127
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:36.220
So don't tell him I actually dropped a piece and trod on it.

128
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:41.710
So we'll never repair the damage to this DNA, but all being well,

129
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.040
the mutation won't cause any serious problem.

130
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:52.390
<v 3>And you can see, I can't read it from here,</v>

131
00:08:52.391 --> 00:08:55.780
but it's about 173 grams.
