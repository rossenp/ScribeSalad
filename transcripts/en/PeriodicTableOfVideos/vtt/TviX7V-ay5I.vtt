00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.650
<v 0>Indium is a really fascinating material.</v>

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.850
And we're going to show you why it was called indium,

3
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.470
how you can mold things out of it

4
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.580
And how you can do some reactions. And Neil's going to have some rules.

5
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:21.763
<v 1>Fun.</v>

6
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.410
<v 0>Had quite a few samples of indium because it is a slightly</v>

7
00:00:30.411 --> 00:00:35.390
poisonous element and people give it to him rather than having to dispose

8
00:00:35.391 --> 00:00:36.650
of it themselves.

9
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.630
And so he has a selection of pieces of rods and wires,

10
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.070
and a really quite nice thick wire that was originally coiled.

11
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.580
And he showed how you can just pull the coil apart.

12
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.860
And even this thick wire is so bendy that when you put your hands

13
00:00:54.861 --> 00:00:58.880
together, it just bends with almost no effort at all.

14
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.190
<v 1>Look, Oh my God, who is that?</v>

15
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.220
He still lives in dim wire. It's very, very malleable, very,

16
00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:10.880
very soft.

17
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.320
<v 0>It's very easy to form into shapes, but what was really nice was the inmate,</v>

18
00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:18.770
the ball of this wire, and then thumped it with a hammer

19
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.470
know,

20
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.210
Neil has a big selection of hammers and produced quite a nice flat

21
00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:28.880
sheet. These pieces of wire,

22
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.210
essentially cold molded together.

23
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.070
And as students I sold the sheet,

24
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.100
I thought we should try and make an impression of a coin.

25
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.203
<v 1>Um.</v>

26
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.590
<v 0>So I produced a British 20 Pence piece,</v>

27
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.600
which has a nice picture of her majesty the queen and put it on the India.

28
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.720
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

29
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.600
<v 0>And Neil hit it with a hammer.</v>

30
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.130
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

31
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.330
<v 0>Of course he hit the side with not the Queen's picture on it's out of respect.</v>

32
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.490
And we got a very nice impression of the queen on the second

33
00:02:10.491 --> 00:02:12.260
attempt. It was even nicer

34
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.960
Though. He did bend my coin and it's really remarkable how much

35
00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:26.990
detail can be pressed into this soft metal.

36
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.610
You can even see her earring. I didn't know the queen wore nearing.

37
00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:36.530
I've never looked at her portraits in such detail then because

38
00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:39.350
we have many viewers in the United States,

39
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.610
we felt it was only right to do an impression of an American coin.

40
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.260
So we chose the quarter.

41
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.670
Neil conveniently had one hanging on the wall of his office,

42
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.790
and that also produced an impression.

43
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.100
<v 1>But not quite beautiful as.</v>

44
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.900
<v 0>The impression of her majesty,</v>

45
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.220
but then it was time to do slightly more serious experiments.

46
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.590
And one of the things about indium and the reason why I've used it in my career

47
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.770
is that it has really quite a low melting point,

48
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.160
just above 150 degrees centigrade.

49
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.760
And it can be used for soldiering things.

50
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.890
We therefore wanted to demonstrate how easily you can melt it.

51
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.900
So Neil put quite a large amount of India into a polling

52
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.770
tube, heated it up and you can watch it melting.

53
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.480
And then when it melted, he thought it was a pity to waste the liquid metal.

54
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.460
He poured it into little mold and made a sort of hemisphere

55
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.353
of indium.

56
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.680
<v 2>And what.</v>

57
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.070
<v 0>See to tout being Neil. He couldn't resist the hammer again.</v>

58
00:03:53.071 --> 00:03:55.350
And so he hammered it again almost flat.

59
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.820
<v 2>Uh, again, when I.</v>

60
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.660
<v 0>Was using indium as soda for my research,</v>

61
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.730
I was soldiering gold thermocouples thermocouples for measuring

62
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.710
very low temperature. And I remembered that when I was doing this,

63
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.240
sometimes the gold would melt because the indium

64
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.430
alloyed with the gold and caused it to melt,

65
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.320
which of course ruined the thermocouple.

66
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.510
So I had a small piece of gold thermal, couple wire left.

67
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.980
I found in my cupboard in here and I wanted Neil to

68
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.820
dissolve it in his liquid indium. First of all,

69
00:04:41.821 --> 00:04:46.620
we made the mistake because we forgot that there was varnish on the

70
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.900
wire, but he burnt that off.

71
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.380
And even so we never got it to work.

72
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.450
I don't know whether I was particularly clumsy when I was a student using indium

73
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.910
soda, or we were doing something else wrong, but it was a bit of disappointment.

74
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.590
However, the next experiment was really good.

75
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.570
Many of you may think that the element indium was named after the

76
00:05:12.571 --> 00:05:16.230
country, India I'm here in India, in Mumbai.

77
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.820
What used to be called Bombay behind me is the gateway to India

78
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.410
because there are lots of elements named after countries or States,

79
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.430
California, gallium, germanium, and so on.

80
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.650
But in fact, it turns out that indium was named after a color,

81
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.660
the color Indigo,

82
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.310
which is the sort of violet color that you'd see in rainbows

83
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.160
when Indian was first discovered,

84
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.260
it was discovered actually as a line in the spectrum of violet line

85
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.020
before they had isolated. And if the metal,

86
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.940
so Neil decided that we should try and see this

87
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.860
violet color, this Indigo color. And we tried to Excel.

88
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.463
<v 1>Experiments.</v>

89
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.940
<v 0>First one was just take a crucible with India,</v>

90
00:06:09.941 --> 00:06:14.920
minutes to heat in the map to let melted and then put a blow torch

91
00:06:14.921 --> 00:06:18.340
on it. That is a high temperature, gas flame,

92
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.020
and see what you could see.

93
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.060
And there was a really nice Indigo color.

94
00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.710
Brady was really excited, unfortunately,

95
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.700
that was just the time that I chose to go out to the room to a meeting. So I.

96
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.260
<v 1>You got it, baby. You got it.</v>

97
00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.990
<v 0>Actually, they didn't see the color straight away,</v>

98
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.310
but they had to hit the Indian pretty hard. And then the color appeared.

99
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.840
I think the reason is that the color comes from

100
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.260
atoms, not very many atoms in the gas phase.

101
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.830
So you've got to hit the India map to a very high temperature.

102
00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.200
And once it is in the gas phase,

103
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.300
it is hot enough for the electrons to be excited in

104
00:07:04.301 --> 00:07:05.380
the atoms.

105
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.730
And then when these electrons return to their original level,

106
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.110
they give out light.

107
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:15.970
It is a characteristic of indium that because of the

108
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:20.530
energy levels, that the light comes out at this very characteristic,

109
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.760
violet, Indigo color, which other elements don't produce.

110
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.530
So it was quite easy for the German discovers of the element

111
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.450
to notice that there was something unusual, this unusual line.

112
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:39.370
Then I suggested that Neil to try desolving indium in bromine,

113
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:45.250
the reason being that most Indian salts are colorless and

114
00:07:45.251 --> 00:07:49.840
bromine is red. So I thought it would look nicer on the video. It looked nice,

115
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.410
but then Jim didn't dissolve.

116
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.660
So it was a bit of a disappointing experiment. So it was good.

117
00:07:58.870 --> 00:07:59.703
Dave wasn't there,

118
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:04.750
but Neil is a huge believer in nitric acid to dissolve almost anything

119
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.170
except gold. So he poured,

120
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.790
concentrated nitric acid on the Indian and was not disappointed.

121
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:13.780
Great.

122
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:18.430
Babblings bubbles of [inaudible] the Brown gas

123
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.420
and the indium at least partly dissolved.

124
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:26.830
The indium is dissolving and making indium nitrates.

125
00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:30.070
That's indium three plus irons.

126
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.070
And I know three minus irons.

127
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:37.960
We never isolated the intimidate trait,

128
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.410
but because I hadn't been there new thoughts,

129
00:08:41.411 --> 00:08:43.750
he would try and show me the color again,

130
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:47.380
this time he took some wooden splints.

131
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:52.390
These are just very thin bits of wood and dipped it into the nitric

132
00:08:52.391 --> 00:08:53.440
acid solution,

133
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:58.410
which now contained indium irons and put

134
00:08:58.411 --> 00:08:59.610
that in the flame.

135
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.380
And you could see the nice Indigo color.

136
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:10.020
I'd never seen that before. And so it was really quite an exciting first.

137
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:15.710
Yeah. I still think the purple color of plutonium's three salts and nicer,

138
00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:20.420
but we can't do plutonium in Neil's lab yet.

139
00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.780
So India is a good substitute.

140
00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.610
Are many other elements named after colors? Um,

141
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:34.070
well Iridium is named after its many colored

142
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.640
salts, rather like the English word iridescence.

143
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.830
And I believe that rhodium is also named after the red color of one of

144
00:09:42.831 --> 00:09:43.940
its salts.

145
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:48.770
And I'm sure our viewers will remind me of lots of other elements that are named

146
00:09:48.771 --> 00:09:52.520
after colors, but I can't think of any immediately.

147
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:54.740
There's a really important use for indium,

148
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:59.450
which is in almost any sort of computer display screen,

149
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:04.130
which consists of liquid crystals or some similar

150
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.550
materials sandwiched between two pieces of glass.

151
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.870
Obviously you have to be able to see through the glass so you won't see the

152
00:10:11.871 --> 00:10:16.370
display, but the glass,

153
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:20.390
the inside surface of the glass has to conduct electricity.

154
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:23.780
Otherwise you cannot activate the pixels.

155
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:29.510
So what happens is that the glass is coated with a material called

156
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:31.250
indium tin oxide.

157
00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:37.070
I sent emails all over the university to try and find sample of glass

158
00:10:37.071 --> 00:10:40.880
with indium tin oxide. And then Neil said,

159
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:45.170
I've got a big piece. So I need to bother. They could adjust us.

160
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.380
Neil what's you see is there's a sheet of glass,

161
00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:53.390
which has a thin coating of indium tin oxide on one side

162
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:54.860
and not on the other.

163
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:59.540
If you take a meter that measures electrical resistance,

164
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:03.200
you can see that on the glass side,

165
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.250
doesn't conduct electricity at all. But on the other side,

166
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.650
where there's the indium tin oxide,

167
00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:13.640
as you move the probes of the meter apart,

168
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:18.260
you can see the resistance goes up and down and it does conduct electricity.

169
00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:23.480
Doesn't conduct it terribly well, but it's transparent.

170
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.120
And it does conduct enough for displays.

171
00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.960
There is quite a serious problem in terms of

172
00:11:29.961 --> 00:11:31.370
sustainability,

173
00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:36.590
where are the computer screens going to come for your children,

174
00:11:36.591 --> 00:11:37.880
your grandchildren,

175
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:42.890
because the supplies of indium are beginning to

176
00:11:42.891 --> 00:11:43.724
run out.

177
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:48.290
So it's really very important that when you finish with your LCD

178
00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:52.280
screen, when you finish with your computer,

179
00:11:52.281 --> 00:11:55.810
your smartphone, you should get it recycled.

180
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.230
So people can begin to reclaim these elements.

181
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:04.510
Or you may find that when you get to your aid phone 20 or a

182
00:12:04.511 --> 00:12:08.740
phone 30, there won't be enough indium to be put on the screens.

183
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:13.530
Obviously we try to bring you as much chemistry as possible here in our videos,

184
00:12:13.531 --> 00:12:18.060
but if you really want to fill your boots, why not check out the great courses?

185
00:12:18.061 --> 00:12:19.230
Plus have a look at this

186
00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:26.880
60 half hour lessons with the Georgetown university expert,

187
00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.480
all about chemistry. Everything's here. Essentially.

188
00:12:30.481 --> 00:12:34.890
It's guiding you through a full college level chemistry curriculum,

189
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:39.360
and this is just one of an ever-growing library of courses.

190
00:12:39.361 --> 00:12:41.880
They have covering all sorts of subjects. You name it.

191
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:46.410
They're going to have no tests, no homework, just lots of knowledge.

192
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:51.450
You can do them on your computer tablet, phone, whatever for a free trial,

193
00:12:51.451 --> 00:12:56.100
go to the great courses plus.com/periodic videos.

194
00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:58.770
So they know you came from here, should be on the screen,

195
00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:00.000
down in the description,

196
00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.540
check them out people and our thanks to them for supporting this video.
