1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.620
<v 0>I'm really excited.</v>

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.870
I'm here in Duke now in Russia at the joint Institute of

3
00:00:06.871 --> 00:00:07.920
nuclear research.

4
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.510
And I'm in the office of URI [inaudible] after whom element

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.940
118 was named I'm the first time I've ever been in the office with somebody that

6
00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:19.740
has an element named after him.

7
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.380
And as a bonus next door on the other side of the corridor is the

8
00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:30.270
office of Fleury off after whom element 114 was

9
00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:34.770
named. So two great heroes in one place. Sadly,

10
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.900
he died many years ago,

11
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.880
but his office has been preserved exactly as it was on the day he died.

12
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.620
So we can see lots of the things that belong to him and his books and so on.

13
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.370
So you'll read, perhaps you can take this to the office.

14
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.610
<v 1>He's a Florida office.</v>

15
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.860
Now he's a small museum and whatever various

16
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.900
possible events will come here, I will be scoffing girls these table.

17
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.210
So these all booms,

18
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.370
we show him in his life are different time and also

19
00:01:10.371 --> 00:01:12.350
he's led her to stop.

20
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.180
<v 0>So this is a letter written by flurry of, to Stalin.</v>

21
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.620
It begins steer use of this, which,

22
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.770
which is Stalin's first name.

23
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.450
And then he explains the possibilities of using

24
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.580
uranium for a bomb that he says

25
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.830
says that it is almost science fiction, but if it works,

26
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.290
the payoff would be enormous.

27
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.820
<v 1>He spoke thick and heroic. Yeah.</v>

28
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.300
<v 0>This is his lab coat. Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.460
Was he a big man?

30
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.080
<v 1>Yeah, it's just like me, me and also Amy, by the way,</v>

31
00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:56.600
it was a meeting here. Sometimes

32
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.240
we'll have the fittings at the changes, uptick of his car.

33
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.820
He's very much typical for flora. And if you look on the Blackboard,

34
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.050
now we discussed together with fluoro,

35
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.180
how to make a talkin material. Curium two 50. Yeah.

36
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.090
Having underground explosion. But we small explosion,

37
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.080
which may produce kudos to 50. And he.

38
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.270
<v 0>You were saying his,</v>

39
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.770
he was proposing an underground nuclear explosion. Exactly.

40
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.840
And to collect the material and from this to make five

41
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.550
micrograms of Cuban Curium and so was the hundred

42
00:02:43.551 --> 00:02:48.470
tons, the, the power of the explosion, correct to you?

43
00:02:48.471 --> 00:02:52.790
Was he, was he like a friend or was he like your boss? What was your,

44
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.713
what was your reaction?

45
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.560
<v 1>The age difference between me and 20 years.</v>

46
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.670
Of course, I cannot say this and white for that, but, uh,

47
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.460
we worked together many years. See, just after the issue,

48
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.500
they came here in his laboratory until he was

49
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:19.060
alive, who were working together for me, he was a really

50
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.030
some person, he opened me the science. I mean,

51
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:29.230
the physics of this problem of the super-heavy was so

52
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.830
fantastically mean for, for yarn guy.

53
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:36.880
Like I was that they really completely up

54
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.160
to this problem. I would say, if I start out again,

55
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.960
I will take this way from the first meeting with him.

56
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.400
Uh, I was a conversation like that.

57
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.270
He does ask me about the physics.

58
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.860
You just asked me what I'm

59
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.560
like life make I sport.

60
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.640
If I like a theater music,

61
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.940
any other thing? So you actually, it was just a

62
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.710
conversation like that. I said, okay. Okay.

63
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.620
I satisfied. Thank you very much.

64
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.430
I take maybe group.

65
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.610
<v 2>What's it like for you to come in here today? Like when you,</v>

66
00:04:32.611 --> 00:04:35.430
when you come in here as now that he has died,

67
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.480
does it make you feel any emotion? Does it bring back memories?

68
00:04:39.481 --> 00:04:43.080
Is it just a museum to you? What, what does this room make you feel?

69
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.320
<v 1>I don't know how to say it in English, but</v>

70
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.010
[inaudible] but he

71
00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.653
[inaudible]. So he dreams.

72
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.790
<v 2>When he sleeps, he dreams is talking to flurry of what does he say to you?</v>

73
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.900
<v 1>Because, uh, a typical life here at Duke Davos,</v>

74
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.480
uh, after the walking dead, uh,

75
00:05:21.481 --> 00:05:24.510
six o'clock you come, Oh,

76
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.710
a nine o'clock phone. Call what? Goodwill

77
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.580
please? Every day.

78
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.830
And every day from nine to 10, 10 30,

79
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.650
one hour free discussion.

80
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.620
That's very good. Did he live close to you? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

81
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.630
And also sometimes he called very early morning

82
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.880
just to say, I'm very sorry. The quality.

83
00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:01.910
So only it seven o'clock in the morning.

84
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.000
<v 2>How did you feel when they made the decision to name an element after flare off</v>

85
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.110
Ferrovial did you, did this make you feel?

86
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.950
<v 1>I find that it wasn't mine, but just the ability,</v>

87
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.620
because they mean walk with this bale

88
00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.300
all my life. So he's really mean,

89
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.930
unfortunately passed away at that time.

90
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.950
When I say her

91
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.690
wife dawned on me, it's my duty.

92
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.460
If one day I can be scoured, the one

93
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.900
I first name I won't get.

94
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:54.730
It's really, almost like that.

95
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.540
<v 2>Professor tomorrow, we see the inauguration of these new elements.</v>

96
00:06:58.541 --> 00:07:00.010
Do you wish he was there tomorrow?

97
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.320
Do you wish he could be with us tomorrow to see this?

98
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.580
<v 1>[Inaudible] it would be his dream.</v>

99
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.440
If it was a dream at the [inaudible] it would be a dream. The beloved,

100
00:07:11.441 --> 00:07:12.274
which star

101
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:17.703
[inaudible].

102
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.390
<v 0>Yes, it was his dream for the new curation of flerovium</v>

103
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.080
and it would also be a dream if he was there tomorrow.

104
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:31.660
<v 1>He came from Kamchatka and he took his crap.</v>

105
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.660
<v 2>This was always on his wall. Was it? Yeah.</v>

106
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:44.740
Did he catch this or didn't was it given as a gift or was it, was it, was he,

107
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:46.630
did he cut? Did he catch it?

108
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:51.550
<v 1>He mentioned that income sharp [inaudible] crap,</v>

109
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.850
uh, craps com uh, died

110
00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.320
and he took one shot should be crap.

111
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.100
<v 0>What is this.</v>

112
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.450
<v 1>For discussion? He would tell me.</v>

113
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.960
<v 2>Was he impatient? It sounds like he was impatient. Hurry up.</v>

114
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.680
<v 0>When you go to Pena.</v>

115
00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:30.910
So he wasn't very patient. Apparently he wasn't very patient,

116
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:34.900
so everything had to be done quickly.

117
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.210
And so in this case, they take plutonium,

118
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:44.710
which is element 94 and to make 114,

119
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:45.910
you need 20.

120
00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.870
So you take a nucleus of calcium,

121
00:08:49.871 --> 00:08:51.760
which has atomic number 20,

122
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.300
you accelerate calcium very rapidly.
