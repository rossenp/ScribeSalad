00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.420
<v 0>The sample may not look very much,</v>

2
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.700
but it's sample of the saltiest water that you can find on this

3
00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:18.020
planet. It comes from a really small lake, not even a lake,

4
00:00:18.021 --> 00:00:21.140
a pond in the north of Ethiopia.

5
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.760
This was collected by one of my friends at bothered Paris when he was on

6
00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:29.360
holiday collected in a plastic water bottle.

7
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.980
And then he analyzed it and found that it was the saltiest

8
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.470
water that's ever been discovered.

9
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.570
And he's got it into the Guinness world records Ethiopia in case you've

10
00:00:41.571 --> 00:00:44.870
forgotten is on the Eastern part of Africa,

11
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.810
quite close to the equator and bright in the north.

12
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.550
There's a region called the Danica depression, which is well below sea level.

13
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.070
It's part of the rift valley,

14
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.570
which is an area of huge seismic and volcanic

15
00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:02.960
activity. And in 2005,

16
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.560
following an earthquake, a new lake appeared

17
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.420
I'm. So I don't pronounce it correctly,

18
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.590
but its name looks to me as if it's pronounced gait. Allah,

19
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.220
what is really unusual is the water is very hot.

20
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.440
60 degrees centigrade.

21
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.920
That's hotter than you can bear to jump into.

22
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.900
And it's hot because there is a hot spring coming through the

23
00:01:29.901 --> 00:01:31.370
volcanic rock.

24
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.900
And not only is it coming up and bubbling up into the lake,

25
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.160
you can see bubbles coming up, but at the same time,

26
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.450
it is desolving souls that are in the soil.

27
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.070
The concentration of the salt is so high mixture of

28
00:01:49.071 --> 00:01:54.020
calcium and magnesium chloride that the water is actually saturated.

29
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.530
You cannot physically dissolve any more salt.

30
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.360
There is 43.3% dissolve solid by

31
00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:05.840
weight. What that means is if you have a liter of water,

32
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.730
you have 433 grams of dissolved, solid,

33
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.250
nearly half the weight of the water.

34
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.430
Even on this bowl sample that I've got,

35
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.450
you can see a big difference in weight. I've got an empty bottle,

36
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.530
a bottle of water and a bottle of water from the pond.

37
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.330
We weigh the empty bottle. And this balance has a thing that is called tear,

38
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.160
which allows us to set it to zero when the bottles on there.

39
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.270
So we'll just way whatever's in the bottle we put on

40
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.550
the water comes to 15.5.

41
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.310
We put this on here. 22.2.

42
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.380
The other thing that you might notice is that because this water is at

43
00:02:51.381 --> 00:02:56.300
room temperature and this room in Nottingham is barely 20 degrees

44
00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:58.910
today that some of the salt has,

45
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.670
you can see that the crystals at the bottom,

46
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.700
and this is because in general,

47
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.500
these types of souls dissolve better in hot water than they do in

48
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:16.210
cold water. So when you put the water in here, let it cool down.

49
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.100
Some of the things precipitate,

50
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.230
some of you who know chemistry will say calcium chloride and magnesium

51
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:27.940
chloride the colorless. So why is this water yellow?

52
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.250
And the answer is that it contains a trace of iron three,

53
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.080
which forms quite a strong yellow color in the presence of high concentrations

54
00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:42.220
of chloride. So although it looks yellow,

55
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.300
the yellow component is a really tiny part. Of course,

56
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.530
people have been looking for the saltiest water in the world for some time,

57
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.940
this is a new record, and you might wonder what was the previous record?

58
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.890
And the previous record was a pond called the Don one

59
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:04.810
pond in the Antarctica where there was a very,

60
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.270
or there still is a very salty lake,

61
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.890
which has 403 grams per liter of dissolve sold.

62
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.200
Now, the reason why it's not as salty as this pound in

63
00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:22.030
Ethiopia is because Ethiopia is near the equator and the water

64
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:26.290
is hotter than the nine ticker as you cool down

65
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.090
water, even though it's still saturated, it contains less salt.

66
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.200
And the colder you go, the less and less salt will dissolve.

67
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.120
Eventually when it freezes to ice, you get no salt in it at all.

68
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.320
You might ask, how does this compare with the dead sea?

69
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.960
I think it's about twice as much so or dissolve material as the dead sea.

70
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.910
According to Brady the dead sea water tastes like acid.

71
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.220
Oh yeah, it's salty

72
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.240
this, but broadly it will.

73
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.370
It will taste twice as awful unless its taste is

74
00:05:17.371 --> 00:05:18.151
logarithmic.

75
00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:22.770
In which case it might be a lot more compared to seawater is about

76
00:05:22.771 --> 00:05:25.110
14 times as salty. Well,

77
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.940
14 times as much dissolved sold seawater also has a

78
00:05:29.941 --> 00:05:33.900
different composition. It has a lot of sodium chloride in it,

79
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.020
whereas there's very little sodium in this.

80
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.000
And the reason is that this is not a pond where sea

81
00:05:42.001 --> 00:05:43.740
water has evaporated,

82
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.460
but it's come from dissolved souls and the ground,

83
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.580
which do not originate from the seed.

84
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:55.350
This is Eduardo's paper published in the journal called

85
00:05:55.351 --> 00:05:59.180
aquatic geochemistry. Have you ever published in that one? No,

86
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.740
because I'm not a geo chemist and I study water is that water

87
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.080
at Walter is not,

88
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.310
but he is a good chemist and good canvas can do anything.

89
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.140
The chemical analysis of the water of the gate, Talla pond,

90
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.830
a small water body located in the Danica depression.

91
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.160
Ethiopia resulted to be the most, say line water,

92
00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:26.060
body on earth with total dissolved solids of

93
00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:29.090
433 grams per kilogram.

94
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:30.603
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

95
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.820
And when they started making these aerosols in the

96
00:06:36.821 --> 00:06:40.690
aerosols, they put a molecule rather like this,

97
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.600
which has carbon in the middle.

98
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:53.110
[inaudible].

99
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:54.430
<v 3>This is their Carnegie river.</v>

100
00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.180
It's about 20 kilometers from the city center.

101
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.970
And I'm where right in the middle of a.
