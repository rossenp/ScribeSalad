00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.870
<v 0>At the time of making this video December, 2016,</v>

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.880
it is probably a unique time for the periodic table in any of

3
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:13.440
your lifetimes, because the name of four different elements,

4
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.190
[inaudible] Muskogee, Liam, Tennessee Inn,

5
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.290
and a goodness son have all been announced simultaneously.

6
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.610
And it is extremely unlikely that this will happen again,

7
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.350
four elements at once for a very long time, if ever now,

8
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.963
Oh,

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.980
Gunnison element 118 is special for a number of different reasons.

10
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.900
The first thing which makes it very special is that it is the last

11
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.160
element on the mental layer form of the periodic table.

12
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.750
It completes a row.

13
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.000
The second point is that it is only the second element that has been named

14
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.380
after living scientists, the [inaudible].

15
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.240
And the third point is that it is a noble

16
00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:04.074
gas.

17
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.850
And so we'll have particularly interesting properties and fourthly.

18
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.800
And the thing which I find most interesting is that there was a

19
00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:18.300
case of scientific fraud or at least scientific

20
00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:23.010
irregularity earlier on when a lab claimed to have discovered this

21
00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:27.450
element and then had to retract that is say they were wrong.

22
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.130
So this element of Gudnason has been named in

23
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.080
honor of the very famous nuclear chemist or perhaps

24
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:41.400
physicist in Russia. You're, it's a lack of it.

25
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.700
So lack of which means son of Solak, again,

26
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.800
this young he's a pioneer and very

27
00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:54.390
long time researcher in Dubliner the research

28
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.250
center to the North of Moscow.

29
00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.350
The only other element that was named after living scientists with CBO Gilliam

30
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.170
named after Glenn Seaborg,

31
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.580
who was the discovery of plutonium and several other elements,

32
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.680
there is a slight difference because Gunnison does not type quite

33
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.190
the whole of agonist aliens surname in it.

34
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.770
But I think this is a trivial difference and it is

35
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:27.420
often been said that having an element named off two is much

36
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.430
better than winning a Nobel prize because Nobel prize winners get forgotten

37
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.540
pretty quickly.

38
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.130
Whereas your name is on the wall of nearly every school room in the

39
00:02:38.131 --> 00:02:41.850
world. Well, at least every science lab in the world.

40
00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:45.540
So it's a terrific Memorial. There's a bit of argument,

41
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.630
whether Einstein was told on his death bed,

42
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.570
that an element was going to be named after him,

43
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.580
but the formal naming was after his death and any way he didn't

44
00:02:56.581 --> 00:02:59.590
discover or contribute to the discovery of the elements.

45
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.570
So I don't think that counts, I have not yet met your it's a luck of it,

46
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.280
but I hope that we will meet in 2017. And if we do,

47
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.280
there will be plenty of videos to market.

48
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.090
I think it's a terrific name and I fully support it.

49
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.710
It is interesting because the name ends in on O N,

50
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.240
which is the ending that is used for the names of all the noble

51
00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:29.020
gases except helium, which does end with IUL.

52
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.310
The interesting thing is that as these gases get heavier,

53
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.570
they are going to be much less volatile.

54
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.030
That is they are going to be harder if you'd like for them to take off,

55
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.980
like it's harder for jumbo jet to take off than for a glider. If anything,

56
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:52.870
the evidence for element 118 is more secure than for

57
00:03:52.871 --> 00:03:56.410
most other elements in this region of the periodic table.

58
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.910
And there is a reason why people want to be absolutely sure,

59
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.510
because in the late 1990s,

60
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.890
there was a claim from America that element

61
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.530
118 had been synthesized.

62
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.210
You have to understand that the output from an experiment,

63
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:21.040
it's huge quantities of data from a detector stored in a computer.

64
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.420
And then you have data analysis programs that look for the

65
00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:30.370
results of decades, of these different elements and all being well,

66
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.390
you might discover one or two or three decades, but not very many.

67
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.130
What appears to have happened in this case is that one of the researchers about

68
00:04:39.131 --> 00:04:43.750
that Gary and physicist called Nina appears to have in some way,

69
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.720
either change the date or change the algorithm.

70
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.550
So it appeared that element 118 had been discovered after two or three

71
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:52.384
years,

72
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.280
it was decided that the experiments could not be duplicated other labs,

73
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.960
trying to do it, and couldn't find any trace from their particular recipe.

74
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.670
And also even looking at the original data.

75
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.730
People couldn't reproduce the analysis.

76
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.400
And so the original paper was withdrawn.

77
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.650
I think this is an enormously important lesson to all of you who are

78
00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:18.790
doing science.

79
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.920
You should enjoy the results you get and you should not

80
00:05:23.921 --> 00:05:28.840
try and fiddle the results or massage the data to try and make them

81
00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:31.960
better. Because first of all,

82
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.580
if you're found out it will destroy your reputation,

83
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.770
but most important of all the joy of doing science is to

84
00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:46.180
understand nature, to understand how matter behaves.

85
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.990
And if you cheat, you don't understand anything.

86
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.510
So it removes all the joy and excitement of doing

87
00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:56.170
science.

88
00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.590
The other reason people have got so excited about elements,

89
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.350
119, a goodness on is that it completes the mental life

90
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.670
periodic table.

91
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.570
You have a nice complete row and it looks as if it's finished.

92
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.890
And several people already asked me, is there going to be any more element,

93
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:17.120
119 elements,

94
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.320
120 and quite conveniently.

95
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.850
My answer is on this Japanese tea town,

96
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.450
where you can say,

97
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.920
if you draw the periodic table,

98
00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:37.730
like this is not actually finished at 118,

99
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.010
because 119 and 120 are there on the right

100
00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:46.360
hand side. So we could,

101
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.150
even if we use the traditional Mendeleev style one,

102
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.500
we could just start a new couldn't work. Yes, of course we can start a new row.

103
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.030
The advantage of this format is that it shows us

104
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:03.520
that there's nothing special about 118 being the

105
00:07:03.521 --> 00:07:06.880
last one. And it gives us encouragement to keep going.

106
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:11.620
You could of course say in the Mandalay format, well, you know, it's complete,

107
00:07:11.621 --> 00:07:14.890
we're never going to be able to do it. Whereas if you look here,

108
00:07:14.891 --> 00:07:17.140
you can see it's quite reasonable.

109
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.880
I very much hope that in the next year or so

110
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.630
that the first glimmers of a result for 119 or more,

111
00:07:25.631 --> 00:07:30.040
probably 120, because if you look at the history of the periodic table,

112
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.210
the even elements seem to be discovered before the odd ones.

113
00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:38.980
I think there is a real chance that we will keep going

114
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.960
and nobody will be more excited than I am. Well, perhaps you're,

115
00:07:43.961 --> 00:07:47.350
it's a lot of [inaudible] maybe even more excited,

116
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.370
five years in the job. Can you imagine what that must be like? Yeah.

117
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:56.050
That's nothing because the longest serving foreign secretary of the Royal

118
00:07:56.051 --> 00:08:00.190
society is that man behind us, very famous scientists.

119
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:05.230
This is Thomas Young and my great hero because he was such a

120
00:08:05.231 --> 00:08:08.620
good foreign secretary. Now, professor,

121
00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:11.830
clearly I don't have to introduce you to Keith because here's a little secret

122
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.220
view is.
