00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:08.783
<v 0>Ready, I'm ready.</v>

2
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.850
<v 1>Here in the lab. We're going to make a plastic called Bakelite.</v>

3
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.740
<v 2>Bakelite was one of the first plastics</v>

4
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.780
that became widespread.

5
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.340
<v 1>It was made about a hundred years ago for the first time by a guy called Baker.</v>

6
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.480
<v 2>Baked land was spelled in a quite complicated way with ease and ease.</v>

7
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.490
But the material he invented quite soon became much more

8
00:00:37.491 --> 00:00:40.030
simply called Bakelite. And it became.

9
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.540
<v 1>It's very popular when people were making telephones and, um,</v>

10
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.090
toys and all kinds of things.

11
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.820
<v 2>If you remember, we didn't have telephones in our pockets.</v>

12
00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:54.230
There was a telephone in a place of all-knowing usually in the whole of a house.

13
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.430
The telephone was made out of Bakelite and because it was brittle,

14
00:00:58.431 --> 00:01:01.640
if you drop the telephone, it broke. Have you ever owned any bait?

15
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.880
<v 1>Not that I know of. I think it might be slightly before my time.</v>

16
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.220
<v 2>Time, particularly the radios,</v>

17
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.690
which in those days occupied the sort of place that TV's

18
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.240
occupy. Now, people used to sit around the radio to hear the news, and again,

19
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.040
they had Bakelite cases.

20
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.190
<v 1>So we're going to make it. It's actually a very easy synthesis.</v>

21
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.100
It's the reaction between phenol and formaldehyde.

22
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.050
<v 2>Darren is doing the chemical part of making Bakelite to make real</v>

23
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.650
Bakelite. You have to add so-called wood flour,

24
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.640
which is a powder made from wood,

25
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.100
particularly the part of wood called lignin,

26
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.650
which is what gives wood its strengths.

27
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.820
<v 1>Have in here. If you can see in there a reaction vessel,</v>

28
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.030
we have the phenol already kind of a,

29
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.590
uh, crystalline kind of material.

30
00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.040
And we have here some from all the Heights. So I'm just going to add this in.

31
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.040
<v 0>[Inaudible] what's that dog, your dog.</v>

32
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.690
<v 1>Just turn the heat up a little bit.</v>

33
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.070
And I'm going to put in some acidic acid.

34
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.660
<v 0>[Inaudible] have you ever had this many cameras?</v>

35
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.460
[inaudible].

36
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.710
<v 1>We're going to leave this for a while,</v>

37
00:02:39.711 --> 00:02:43.310
just so we have a nice intimate mixture between the phenol and the

38
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.840
formaldehyde and, and th that'll hit sit there happily,

39
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.380
and nothing will happen until we add this,

40
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.540
which is concentrated hydrochloric acid.

41
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.310
<v 2>If you heated it up,</v>

42
00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.790
it was then sufficiently flexible that you push it into a mold

43
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.040
and mold, all sorts of objects.

44
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.040
Ashtrays people used to smoke a lot then,

45
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.570
and particularly knobs for putting on all sorts of electrical equipment.

46
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:13.030
You'd know that the on, off switches, things like that.

47
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.760
<v 1>So usually</v>

48
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.900
when we do this, nothing happens until we, uh,

49
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.090
after the last couple of meals, I am adding the asset quite slowly.

50
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.620
I think we might be seeing some pink comment.

51
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.593
There we go.

52
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.513
We've made a plastic.

53
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.623
Uh.

54
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.890
<v 2>What Darren is making is called a phenol formaldehyde resin.</v>

55
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.710
<v 1>Um, it's, it's, it's tough. It is. Um,</v>

56
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.350
it's quite a tough material.

57
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.213
<v 2>Well, actually,</v>

58
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.720
I've got a rather crude model down here of Fino.

59
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.920
This is a benzene ring with five hydrogens,

60
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.540
and this is an oxygen atom with another hydrogen on here.

61
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.560
I put this on and it tweaks,

62
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.860
but that's not part of the scientific explanation.

63
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.810
Formaldehyde consists of carbon and oxygen

64
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.850
and two hydrogens, but in the chemical reaction,

65
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.440
the oxygen goes away. And so in the chemical reaction,

66
00:04:49.441 --> 00:04:54.120
which is surprisingly violent and which requires the catalyst,

67
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.100
you can either use a base, that's an alkaline or an acid. In Darren's case,

68
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.930
he used hydrochloric acid because he's really fond of hydrochloric acid.

69
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.360
He used it to dissolve a cheeseburger,

70
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.560
but he used this acid,

71
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.580
which makes the formaldehyde attack,

72
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.950
the Fino I in this position or that position,

73
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.730
there's a called the author positions or the position here para.

74
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.890
And so essentially it joins a whole series of these rings together.

75
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.580
One, four mile, the tide goes in here, then you get another ring.

76
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.320
And so you get to complicated network of these phenol molecules

77
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.300
joined by ch two groups.

78
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.290
And if you look at the chemical structure written down,

79
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.390
it quickly looks like my hair.

80
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.630
<v 1>Okay. So we're going to give this another go. And, um,</v>

81
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.600
the difference this time is we're going to apply a bit more heat and see if

82
00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:52.470
there's any difference.

83
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.150
<v 2>What was discovered by Beckland was that this mixture could be molded</v>

84
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.550
and it led to a large number of different objects being made

85
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.480
nowadays they're much better plastics.

86
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.180
And so Bakelite is not used very much.

87
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.640
There are the whole group of people who collect Bakelite objects for the

88
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.983
soldier's sake.

89
00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:58.090
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

90
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.240
<v 1>We were a bit disappointed actually, because, um,</v>

91
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:05.890
it's not as good as yesterday's yesterday's we coated the inside of the few

92
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.460
boards with Bakelite and, um,

93
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:11.680
we don't really know why it's different yet.

94
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.310
So we'll have to think about that one. We do have footage from yesterdays,

95
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:20.620
so maybe we'll look at the footage again and see if we felt that. Yeah. So, uh,

96
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:26.530
the quality may not be as cool as, yeah,

97
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.010
so.
