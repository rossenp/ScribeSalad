00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.710
<v 0>You must almost certainly have heard about the controversy over the car</v>

2
00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:05.544
company,

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.380
folks Vargon and diesel engines and nitrogen oxides.

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.170
Now I did want to talk about the controversy,

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.420
but the chemistry is really interesting.

6
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.460
So I thought you ought to know about it.

7
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.170
The first thing to say is that this involves diesel engines.

8
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.630
There are two sorts of engines that you can have in cars that petrol engines

9
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.350
and diesel engines, and they use slightly different fuel.

10
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.640
And the main difference between the engines is that in the petrol engine,

11
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.230
there's the spark plug,

12
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.090
which sets fire to the mixture of petrol or

13
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.180
gasoline as you stay in the states and there,

14
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.370
and the flame spreads from the top of the cylinder downwards and pushes the

15
00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:54.030
piston in a diesel engine. There's no spark plug,

16
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.980
but the piston going upwards compresses the mixture of

17
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.570
air and fuel, which gets hot because you're compressing it.

18
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.150
And it spontaneously starts burning.

19
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.430
The advantage of diesel engines is that you can build them very much

20
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.110
bigger for cars, for trains, for even for ships,

21
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.640
but with a petrol engine, there's a limit to the maximum size.

22
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.440
The result of the different way of igniting the setting,

23
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:30.240
fire to the fuel is that the chemistry takes place

24
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.570
inside slightly differently because the temperatures are different.

25
00:01:33.571 --> 00:01:36.870
And the way the flames spreads in both engines,

26
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.700
you have a mixture of air and fuel air contains

27
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:43.740
oxygen, which makes the fuel burn.

28
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.070
It also contains nitrogen gas and two,

29
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.710
and under the high temperature conditions,

30
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.600
some of the nitrogen gas just a tiny bit can react with

31
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.463
oxygen.

32
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.880
And it makes a mixture of oxides of nitrogen.

33
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.950
The two called NOx X is a number which is normally either

34
00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:06.030
one or two.

35
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.770
The reason why we worry about NOx is because these

36
00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:13.530
molecules are really quite reactive.

37
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.930
And the reason is that nitrogen has seven electrons and oxygen

38
00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:20.690
atom as eight.

39
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.520
So if you have either an a or an a too,

40
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.270
it will have an, the number of electrons.

41
00:02:29.271 --> 00:02:32.930
It will have one extra electron that is not paired up,

42
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.780
and this makes the molecules much more reactive.

43
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.910
So if you want to preserve the quality of air in the

44
00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:42.380
city or beside the road,

45
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.180
you want to minimize the amount of any wakes coming out of the exhaust pipe.

46
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.950
Diesel engines produce more NOx than petrol

47
00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:54.380
engines. So in diesel engines,

48
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.940
you have to take special precautions or procedure to try and

49
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.000
minimize the amount of NOx,

50
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.830
especially in the latest cars which are designed to meet strict

51
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.780
emission limits. The chemistry that is used is relatively simple.

52
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.670
You have a catalyst which reacts the NOx with

53
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.653
urea.

54
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.190
Urea is a compound of ammonia and SIO,

55
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.120
or it's made from ammonia and CEO. It has two NH,

56
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:29.800
two groups bound to one C O group urea

57
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.050
is made industrially,

58
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.670
but it is a product that you can find in urine, for example,

59
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.600
and they have been all sorts of jokes about people with diesel cars,

60
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.910
relieving themselves into the engine to make them better, but that's by the by.

61
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.410
But the key point is that you have a reaction between

62
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.350
urea and NOx,

63
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.600
which generates ammonia and nitrogen

64
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.780
and CO2. So in the latest cars,

65
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.100
there is a tank which contains what I believe is a very

66
00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:08.200
concentrated solution of urea.

67
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.270
I don't know the precise details because although I own a folks' wagon diesel,

68
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.670
it's too old to have one of these.

69
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.230
The idea is that a very small amount of this solution is injected into the

70
00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:24.520
exhaust stream. There is a reaction, the NOx is removed.

71
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.230
The scandal has been because the computer that

72
00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:32.620
controls the whole engine has been programmed.

73
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.260
So it only puts the urea in when the engine is being tested for

74
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.250
emissions. And I believe the reason for this is just to save the customers,

75
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.060
having to top up the tank of urea though.

76
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.190
Some articles that I've read,

77
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.300
suggest that it may affect the performance of the engine as well.

78
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.040
So you can't accelerate quite as quickly or whatever it should be said

79
00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.820
that the catalytic converters in cars,

80
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.040
whether they're gasoline cars or diesel cars are

81
00:05:06.041 --> 00:05:10.990
really very clever because what is coming out to the exhaust pipe

82
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.680
contains gases like carbon monoxide,

83
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.510
or perhaps even methane, which needs to be burnt, reacted with oxygen.

84
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.190
And there are other things like NOx that need to be

85
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.830
reduced. You need to remove the oxygen.

86
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.850
And therefore the computer that controls the engine,

87
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.410
the so-called energy management system has to

88
00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:39.670
adjust the amount of oxygen going into the engine very

89
00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:42.280
carefully. And in fact,

90
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.230
one of the key components is a oxygen sensor

91
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.030
that sits in the exhaust pipe so that it can work out oxygen levels.

92
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.420
And those of you who are watching in the UK,

93
00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.200
who have long memories may remember that there was some cheap petrol

94
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:05.150
that was sold a few years ago that managed to ruin the

95
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:08.360
oxygen sensors in a whole series of cars.

96
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:12.860
I think 10,000 cars who'd been to those particular petrol stations.

97
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.840
The reason that we have cleaner emissions from cars now

98
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.000
is because the engines are computer controlled and we can adjust the

99
00:06:23.001 --> 00:06:26.330
chemical conditions inside them very precisely.

100
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.830
And unfortunately it was realized, I don't know,

101
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:35.660
by whom in folks' Vargon that they could manipulate these things so

102
00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:39.590
that they could make the engine cleaner sometimes than others.

103
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.380
<v 1>So this is where we're going to get our CO2 from. It's a rather large cylinder.</v>

104
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.150
So on, on the cylinder, we have a device called a regulator,

105
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:54.130
which you can see here.

106
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.440
<v 2>And, uh,</v>

107
00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.880
draw this direct line between the folk swag and Hitler. I mean, there,

108
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:05.860
there was, of course he was behind the wheel to subsidize it.
