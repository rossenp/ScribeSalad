00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.010
<v 0>You've probably already seen a video on sodium reacting with</v>

2
00:00:05.011 --> 00:00:09.870
water using Neal's new device, his test, you break breakup.

3
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.480
But this week we're going to look at potassium. And as you know,

4
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.470
potassium is more reactive than sodium.

5
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.740
One of the things which you might not realize, in fact,

6
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.630
I had forgotten is that metallic potassium is less

7
00:00:29.631 --> 00:00:32.570
dense than metallic sodium.

8
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.720
So if you have potassium underwater,

9
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.500
it's much more likely to shoot to the surface than sodium,

10
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.770
which has a density very close to the density of water.

11
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.423
Ready for action.

12
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.900
Neil has sealed the potassium into the tube,

13
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.190
but the amount he put in was the same number of atoms.

14
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.680
Approximately, as of sodium,

15
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.220
we in fact did two experiments or Neil did two experiments.

16
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.600
The first one with the test tube, vertical in history.

17
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.543
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

18
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.920
<v 0>Before we start,</v>

19
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.750
let me just remind you that alkaline metals react with water

20
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.370
to produce hydrogen,

21
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.030
and they also produce the hydroxide.

22
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.100
As you watch to begin with,

23
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.970
as the water goes in a few bubbles of hydrogen, come out,

24
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.040
then the reaction gets more violent, much bigger bubbles appear.

25
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.070
They look quite whitish because of the angle of the sunlight

26
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.070
can float off. It's less dense than water.

27
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.690
Yup. They go rather like divers going up inside a diving bell.

28
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.350
And we know that because if you look at the surface with the camera on the

29
00:02:39.351 --> 00:02:42.650
surface, you can see these lumps of potassium appearing.

30
00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:44.570
So we know that they're getting to the surface

31
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.670
quite by chance,

32
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.430
a piece of the tubing floats upward and

33
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.983
inside it,

34
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.670
there is a tiny piece of potassium that's trapped and the tube comes up and then

35
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:11.260
it falls down again. And you can see this little lump of potassium,

36
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.360
which appears to be melted because it's beating rather like the gallium

37
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:17.920
heart that we've shown you.

38
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.780
And you can see this reacting with the water really quite

39
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:23.614
peacefully.

40
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.700
It's not exploding or anything like that because it's a small piece and it's

41
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.390
generating the hydrogen fast enough for the hydrogen to escape.

42
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.150
And the reason it can escape is because Neil didn't quite seal up the end of the

43
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:39.540
tube as well as he could have done.

44
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.980
And you can see bubbles of hydrogen coming out.

45
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.600
This shows that if you have potassium quite a small amount in a

46
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:51.340
relatively unconfined situation, it will react fast,

47
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:52.960
but it won't react to it.

48
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.481
Of course,

49
00:04:12.481 --> 00:04:17.430
Neil is a perfectionist and he's realized

50
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.870
that we shouldn't be doing the experiment with the test you vertically.

51
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.850
And it would be much better to break the test tube horizontally under the wall.

52
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.413
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

53
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.720
<v 0>Okay. So in the second one what's happened was that the</v>

54
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.130
test tube torture went in, smashed the test tube,

55
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.040
and you can see the bubbles of hydrogen coming up,

56
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.680
but then you can see that there is quite a sizeable explosion,

57
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.580
which blows the test tube apart again,

58
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.280
probably because of the pressure of hydrogen.

59
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.980
I know because when I was doing my doctorate,

60
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.460
I put a high pressure of hydrogen into glass vessel,

61
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.040
and it went off with an enormous bang.

62
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.020
So you can get a big explosion with hydrogen pressure in glass

63
00:05:40.021 --> 00:05:44.700
festival because you've got quite a large lump of potassium in a small

64
00:05:44.701 --> 00:05:45.990
volume of glass.

65
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.210
And water is very dense compared to hydrogen gas.

66
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.310
You can have a fast reaction,

67
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.160
will generate a large volume of gas very quickly in fraction of

68
00:05:58.161 --> 00:05:58.730
second.

69
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.680
The other thing which is interesting is that there's enough force in the

70
00:06:03.681 --> 00:06:08.240
reaction to produce multis ripples in the surface of the

71
00:06:08.241 --> 00:06:09.050
water.

72
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.880
You need to think about this because there are several kilos of water in this

73
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:17.960
trough and they're slushing around. So they'd been given quite a push,

74
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.300
but just wait to see what sees him does.
