00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.410
<v 0>As you can see, I'm locked down in a room that's full of books,</v>

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.960
and I know what most of them are.

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.700
But a few weeks ago I discovered the book I didn't realize I

4
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:16.140
had. And there was something really, quite exciting about it.

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.820
I found this book,

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.200
which is called introduction to chemical philosophy,

7
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.300
found it quite late at night.

8
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.160
And then I looked inside a much to my surprise.

9
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.770
I found signature that appeared to be from earnest

10
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.000
rather for the famous physicist. I was amazed.

11
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.010
Usually when you find these things, there's some sorts of forgery or joke,

12
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.080
but I was really excited photograph that incentive to

13
00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:50.040
Keith Moore,

14
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.090
the hero of Brady's objectivity channel.

15
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.190
Who's an expert on things like this. And he emailed back and said,

16
00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:00.360
he thought it was genuine.

17
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.260
<v 1>Where did this book come from? Professor? How come you've got it?</v>

18
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.210
<v 0>I have two theories where it might have come from. I certainly didn't by myself.</v>

19
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.910
And one theory is that I may have inherited it from my

20
00:01:13.911 --> 00:01:16.100
friend David Jones,

21
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.030
who left me his whole library of books.

22
00:01:20.031 --> 00:01:23.420
And I just selected a few in a big hurry.

23
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.620
And I probably chose this one because it's by Tilden.

24
00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:32.450
Who's quite a famous 19th century chemist by probably just took it without

25
00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:37.370
looking inside. The other possibility is that it was

26
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.980
inherited from my wife's family because her grandfather was

27
00:01:42.981 --> 00:01:44.660
a student with Rutherford.

28
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.310
And I suppose it's possible that rather thought this is no book.

29
00:01:49.311 --> 00:01:53.600
I don't know what to do with it. I'll give it to one of my students.

30
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.830
<v 1>Professor from the signature to peers that he's written his name to say,</v>

31
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.260
I own this book. He's not autographing it for us.

32
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.570
<v 0>I totally agree. This is not a dedication to somebody.</v>

33
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.970
This is a thing to show you own it. When I got the book out.

34
00:02:10.971 --> 00:02:14.780
So we could make this video. I noticed surprisingly,

35
00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:18.410
there is a second signature of a Rutherford

36
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.270
inside the cover where you can barely read it. No,

37
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.130
this book was published in 1886 when [inaudible] was 15.

38
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.500
And my theory is that perhaps he bought it second hand.

39
00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:35.690
When he came as a student to England,

40
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.520
he was born in New Zealand because there are a couple of prices written in

41
00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:41.354
pencil,

42
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.130
which is the signature of a second-hand book dealer.

43
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.440
And probably he wrote his name on the inside cover and thought nobody will

44
00:02:51.441 --> 00:02:54.290
see it there. So he wrote it on the next page as well.

45
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.040
<v 1>Perhaps we should tell people who earned us rather foot was. And secondly,</v>

46
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.040
is that book worth a of money earned.

47
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.600
<v 0>This Rutherford was the famous physicist who</v>

48
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.950
formulated the first plausible structure of the atom

49
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.650
and discovered that alpha particles were the nuclei of helium

50
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:18.790
atoms. He won the Nobel prize for chemistry in two,

51
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.560
1908 and 11 of his students also won

52
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:27.700
Nobel prizes shows, have little, all of us have achieved.

53
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.740
I don't think the work is worth very much at all though. Keith Moore,

54
00:03:32.741 --> 00:03:37.420
when he saw the signature and the fact that the book is also written by a fellow

55
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:42.340
of the Royal society is keen to have it from the library of

56
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:45.610
the Royal society. When I've got fed up with it.

57
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.040
<v 1>Hang on a second. I might make you an offer. I'd quite like that one.</v>

58
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.540
Maybe we should have a bidding war.

59
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.460
<v 0>Other thing which I think is interesting is that this book contains a</v>

60
00:03:56.461 --> 00:03:58.830
really quite old periodic table.

61
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.600
This periodic table is therefore by fellow the oldest periodic table that I

62
00:04:03.601 --> 00:04:06.330
possess. And if you look at it,

63
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.520
there are all sorts of strange things it's covered in question marks where

64
00:04:11.521 --> 00:04:13.290
they might be new elements.

65
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.820
Of course they know noble gases because they hadn't been discovered,

66
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.800
but beryllium is certain with the G because

67
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.720
sometimes in those days,

68
00:04:24.721 --> 00:04:29.340
people called it blue Sydney from the Greek word, meaning sweet,

69
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.220
but really am salts are really poisonous,

70
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.170
but somehow people tasted it and decided it tasted sweet.

71
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.240
And then boron,

72
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.280
which I've never seen before is written as BDO and rhodium as

73
00:04:44.281 --> 00:04:45.120
aro.

74
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.030
I suspect they put the periodic table in into terrific hurry.

75
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.460
And they made some mistakes.

76
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.220
<v 1>Professor just while you were talking. I w I,</v>

77
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.930
I was doing a bit of Googling and I found an autograph letter signed by

78
00:05:00.931 --> 00:05:05.700
Rutherford from 1920, selling for two and a half thousand dollars.

79
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.640
<v 0>My feeling is that when it's a letter,</v>

80
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.650
that's something really special when it's just

81
00:05:13.651 --> 00:05:14.850
labeling a book,

82
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.980
just like he might have labeled his clothes for the laundry,

83
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.040
then it probably isn't quite as exciting.

84
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.070
<v 1>But it's a book that's got the periodic table in it. And as we all know,</v>

85
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.380
rather Fred's name is on the periodic table.

86
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.710
<v 0>Yes, there wasn't then of course, no,</v>

87
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.900
but I think I have no idea whether it's worth much money

88
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.153
and,

89
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.110
but it's a very nice feeling that I may be reading a book that

90
00:05:43.111 --> 00:05:44.850
rather for great. Yeah.

91
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.020
<v 1>Isn't it a great thought as well to think about Rutherford having a book and</v>

92
00:05:49.021 --> 00:05:50.850
looking at that periodic table,

93
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.070
not knowing that one day his name would be on it.

94
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.250
<v 0>Yes, of course. That's the,</v>

95
00:05:56.251 --> 00:05:59.030
you assume the T actually read the book

96
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.270
and, um,

97
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.240
and the periodic table seems to be just added as an extra chapter.

98
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.570
The end. Are you going to give the book to Keith at the Royal society?

99
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.770
Probably eventually it could end up on objectivity in a second video,

100
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.480
but the other thing which is quite, I think is interesting.

101
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.710
There are a whole series of questions about the periodic table,

102
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.770
and I can't answer most of them.

103
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.290
They're so old fashioned questions like to explain

104
00:06:33.291 --> 00:06:36.350
the differences between sodium and potassium.

105
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.300
And I have no idea what in 1880s,

106
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.250
somebody would have expected for announce of that question since then no answers

107
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.570
in the book. We'll never know.

108
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.130
<v 1>Through the very moment when you first opened it and saw each other.</v>

109
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.900
<v 0>I was in my, in the study just about to go to bed.</v>

110
00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.990
So it was after 11 o'clock at night.

111
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.240
And for some reason I was just looking at the books and I opened this and I

112
00:07:04.241 --> 00:07:06.910
thought, wow. But of course,

113
00:07:06.911 --> 00:07:10.900
my first thought was the tea was appropriately a forgery,

114
00:07:10.901 --> 00:07:12.790
or what type of though,

115
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:18.070
I don't see why anybody should put rather fits the name in a slightly up-skill

116
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.650
chemistry textbook. If you're going to forge it,

117
00:07:20.651 --> 00:07:23.080
you would forge it somewhere else.

118
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:27.280
I also found in another room here,

119
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:28.780
this book here,

120
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:34.270
which has a photo of Rutherford with his signature, I mean,

121
00:07:34.271 --> 00:07:35.980
this is a printed signature.

122
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.190
What's interesting is by the time he got the signature,

123
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.440
he'd become a Lord.

124
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.090
So he wrote to Rutherford without a knee because there's a

125
00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:49.600
convention in the UK that people who are Lords,

126
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.850
then all men who loads signed just that title Rutherford,

127
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.330
because he was Lord Rutherford without a first name.

128
00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.990
<v 1>Thanks for watching. If you enjoyed this video,</v>

129
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.550
I think there's a really good chance.

130
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.640
You'll enjoy my other YouTube channel objectivity.

131
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.460
It's all about all sorts of famous science,

132
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.950
objects and little stories from history.

133
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.100
I'll put a link here on the screen and down in the video description,

134
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:19.180
we are joined by captain disillusion. And guess what?

135
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:24.460
Today it's happening because this is where they store most of the moon rocks

136
00:08:24.461 --> 00:08:28.810
and soil that will brought back from the moon by the Apollo astronauts joined by

137
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.720
Diana Cowan from the physics scale YouTube channel.

138
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.160
It's the white gloves of destiny.

139
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.730
I didn't tell you who was operating the camera cause it's not James James who

140
00:08:36.731 --> 00:08:38.560
normally does that. He's back in the UK.

141
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.040
It's a very special celebrity camera operator actually.
