00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.210
<v 0>In our last video, we showed you an cut diamonds,</v>

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.710
but today we're going to take you behind the scenes and show you how a mega

3
00:00:07.711 --> 00:00:12.540
diamond like this one is cut and polished into something like

4
00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:16.980
this. But first to the room where diamond deals get done

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.073
this room.

6
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.870
<v 1>Is where it happens,</v>

7
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.830
where people come and look at the diamonds and decide,

8
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.390
do I want to buy it or not? Or perhaps can I afford to buy it?

9
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.280
So over here, we have a selection of diamonds,

10
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.830
which are about to be auctioned.

11
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.510
This small collection is worth about $10 million.

12
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.490
My favorite one is the one over here because it sparkles so much.

13
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.480
Can you take this one and put it on its face?

14
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.460
And you can see it is shaped in a pyramid or a cone.

15
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.700
And it has 57 different faces,

16
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.540
which gives it this really beautiful sparkling color.

17
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.180
This is called a round cut,

18
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.060
presumably because it's circular.

19
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.080
You can also have diamonds cut in the shape of a heart.

20
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.610
Last time we showed you diamonds.

21
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.580
I got really excited when they fluoresced, for me,

22
00:01:19.581 --> 00:01:23.690
that was the best past of all. I thought they were much more valuable.

23
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.290
I now realize that I was completely wrong.

24
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.060
Fluorescence lowers the price here when people are buying,

25
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.920
they checked the fluorescence again. So there is a fluorescent lamp.

26
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.680
And perhaps if we try that one first,

27
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.890
so you can see this one is fluorescing relatively strongly,

28
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.970
and this will probably affect the price. So let's try another one.

29
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.183
Okay.

30
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.900
And you can see that one isn't fluorescing at all. So this one's my favorite.

31
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.070
Can we check this one?

32
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.353
<v 2>Good luck.</v>

33
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.190
<v 1>Nice. So it's okay.</v>

34
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.670
I chose a good one for once you still going to buy that one,

35
00:02:10.671 --> 00:02:15.410
then I think I'll leave that for you. Braiding this cat,

36
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.120
which is called the princess cut is technically the most difficult to

37
00:02:20.121 --> 00:02:23.060
do because of the very square shape.

38
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.350
And so in terms of the actual processing,

39
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.080
this is the most difficult one in the whole box.

40
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.130
So now we've got some really special standings.

41
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.140
Those three stones together probably worth $30 million.

42
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.440
The most exciting one is this pink one in the middle.

43
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.700
You may have read about it in the newspapers. It's just been cut.

44
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.800
It's going to be sent for auction.

45
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.600
Nobody knows the true price that they'll get tens of millions of

46
00:02:53.601 --> 00:02:58.370
dollars. And we on periodic videos are giving you a preview.

47
00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.440
Can you take it then?

48
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.730
So this diamond is 14.85 carrots.

49
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.060
That's not quite three grams,

50
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.530
but when it came out to the ground, it was more than 27 carrots.

51
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.120
So you can see that nearly half the mass of the diamond was lost when it was

52
00:03:21.121 --> 00:03:24.540
cut. And this last diamond disappears is dust.

53
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.150
This it's got a special color called fancy deep purple

54
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.043
pink.

55
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.180
And it's the largest diamond of this color that has ever been found

56
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.110
and polished.

57
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.400
I think I prefer it to the pink one and it's cheaper.

58
00:03:41.401 --> 00:03:44.100
I could get two or three of these for the same price.

59
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.540
This yellow one is also very interesting.

60
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.190
The yellow one is yellow because of nitrogen in the

61
00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:55.530
lattice. Every so often.

62
00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.270
One of the carbon atoms in the lattice has been replaced by

63
00:04:00.271 --> 00:04:01.170
nitrogen.

64
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.310
And it is these nitrogen sensors that give it the yellow color.

65
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.850
The pink stone is different.

66
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.970
The color doesn't come from an impurity,

67
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.800
but the fact that every so often there is a mistake in the lattice.

68
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.570
And these dislocations in the letters give rise to the color.

69
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.640
We're now in the room where they Polish the diamonds.

70
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.770
The key effect is obtained by getting the precise angles between

71
00:04:37.771 --> 00:04:41.850
the different facets that you publish. So over here,

72
00:04:41.851 --> 00:04:43.020
we have a myrcene,

73
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.300
which is a spinning disc going at 2,600 RPM with

74
00:04:48.301 --> 00:04:53.070
diamond dust on the disc. So Polish the surface,

75
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.110
the operator has a plan for his particular

76
00:04:58.111 --> 00:05:02.490
diamond, which tells him what is to do with tangles.

77
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.710
Much of the time is spent adjusting the diamond before you actually

78
00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:11.940
Polish, because if you get it wrong and make a mistake, you've had it.

79
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.280
Each of the tools has a little spirit level on the top so that you can make

80
00:05:17.281 --> 00:05:21.600
sure that it's absolutely flat. And so the angle you'll get is correct.

81
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.740
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

82
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.660
<v 1>This year is the diamond that the league with polishing here is his</v>

83
00:05:33.661 --> 00:05:37.110
plan. And then here on the computer screen,

84
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.060
the angles between the faces that is measured to see how it

85
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.240
compares with the plan and what it should be doing. Of course,

86
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.120
when you grind it, you get a lot of dust.

87
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.200
And so there are extractors like a fume cupboard.

88
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.880
This is sucking air all the time to remove all this very fine carbon,

89
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.040
which is generated when you bring the diamond.

90
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.930
It's amazing to me that so much of the diamond has to be

91
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:10.610
wasted. So it's just low notes, presumably onto the roof of this building.

92
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.220
This is not at all what I expected,

93
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.260
but it's really good because it shows that you need huge technical

94
00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:22.940
experience to turn these diamonds, these rough diamonds,

95
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.310
into something that people want to buy.

96
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:29.630
And where I suppose I expected it to be much more mechanized,

97
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.630
but since every diamond is different,

98
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.030
you have to do it by hand because you can't get automated

99
00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:42.350
machines that will treat each one completely differently here.

100
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:45.740
We're just looking at one of the disks and you can see,

101
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.510
they can change the discs.

102
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.670
It's a bit like your home electric thrill or electric polisher,

103
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.940
but of course, this is much more sophisticated.

104
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.173
<v 2>What does this mean?</v>

105
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.050
<v 1>Is it rough or smooth or [inaudible]</v>

106
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.620
to this to see what it feels like? I expect it to feel a bit rough.

107
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.420
Like the nail file feels completely smooth.

108
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:24.220
Wouldn't know there was any diamond dust there at all, bit of a disappointment.

109
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.600
Well, I think it's moved because the diamond particles are so small

110
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:33.340
that our fingers are too insensitive to feel them because if they were,

111
00:07:33.341 --> 00:07:36.640
if we could feel it, it would probably make scratches on the diamond.

112
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.920
That is the man who polished the pink diamond, took two months,

113
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.460
a one carat diamond,

114
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:53.650
which is 0.2 of a gram 200 milligrams takes four or five days

115
00:07:53.651 --> 00:07:54.820
to do a big one.

116
00:07:54.821 --> 00:07:59.620
Like the Rose diamond took two months and the biggest diamonds they do

117
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.920
take half a year. It's quite warm in here.

118
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:07.630
It's very noisy compared to say an ordinary lab,

119
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:12.280
but not terribly noisy. And there's a slight smell,

120
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.870
perhaps an oily smell. This is the machine for measuring the angles.

121
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:21.910
The diamond is span round. There is a light beam coming down here,

122
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.900
some sort of lights or STEM there with the lens system in here.

123
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:31.420
And the focus beam is then reflected. And because they know the speed,

124
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.690
they can measure the angle and it all comes out on the computer.

125
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.430
This is Anatolia.

126
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:41.860
His computer is the design for the Rose diamond.

127
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:46.450
The really valuable Rose diamond showing how they

128
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.580
decided how to cut it.

129
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:53.980
The light part is the outline of the rough

130
00:08:53.981 --> 00:08:58.620
diamond. And the blue is the finished Rose Stone,

131
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.200
which is going to be sold, which we've seen.

132
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:06.390
The yellow part is the reference plane where they cut the

133
00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:07.224
diamond.

134
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.820
So they have somewhere to start with and then all the angles and everything else

135
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:16.650
are referred to that orange. One green places are defects.

136
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.430
And so what they've had to do is very,

137
00:09:20.431 --> 00:09:25.350
very carefully design the cut so that it cuts out

138
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:26.670
the defects,

139
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.590
but without wasting any of the good parts of the diamond,

140
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:33.570
but you can see on here,

141
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.610
how much of it has to be lost to produce something that looks really good

142
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:39.990
in a piece of jewelry,

143
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:52.280
You can see on the screen, the rough diamond with all its defects,

144
00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.060
it's done by a special company that does the measurements,

145
00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.110
and then it sends them here. They designed the shape,

146
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.870
not so much to get the maximum weight,

147
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.830
but to make the Rose color, the pink color,

148
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.420
as strong as possible.

149
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.140
This is showing where they cut the first face.

150
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:16.340
They use a laser to Mark the edge of the piece that they're going to cut off.

151
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.670
The precise instructions are on the piece of paper,

152
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:24.800
but then their physical markers. So that the person who is grinding,

153
00:10:24.801 --> 00:10:28.490
it knows exactly where to go to.

154
00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.990
This is the department where they cut the diamonds with the laser.

155
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.870
You need to waste as little material as possible.

156
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.000
So the laser beam needs to be as tightly focused as you can. At the same time,

157
00:10:41.001 --> 00:10:45.530
you don't want to heat the diamond too much because it's carbon in

158
00:10:45.531 --> 00:10:49.970
principle, it could catch fire. So you use a stream of water,

159
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.670
which focuses the laser beam.

160
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:56.180
You get to spots about half the size that you would do in air.

161
00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.110
And at the same time, it can cool the diamond.

162
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.950
But of course it makes it harder for Brady to film.

163
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:08.990
One of the skilled publishers can remove a carrot of

164
00:11:08.991 --> 00:11:13.160
material a day. That's 200 milligrams.

165
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.610
This machine can do it in 20 minutes.

166
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.460
They didn't use this for the Rose diamond,

167
00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:24.980
because if something had gone wrong, it would have spoiled everything.

168
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:30.110
When you're polishing by hand, you can see exactly how things are going.

169
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:34.520
Marina is holding a crystal, which has been cut,

170
00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:37.730
and you can see here it is the two pouts together.

171
00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:43.040
And then you can see how they have been cut into two pieces.

172
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.940
The advantages that with this method,

173
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.630
you can still get something out of the little piece.

174
00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.850
You can make a little diamond and this one will be processed to make a much

175
00:11:54.851 --> 00:11:57.550
larger one. What's really surprising to me.

176
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:01.570
At least the first was that the cut surface is black.

177
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:06.880
And the reason is that the laser converts the diamond,

178
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:11.920
just close to where it is cutting from the traditional diamond structure

179
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.090
into graphite.

180
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.800
You need a very high power laser far too big to go in the box.

181
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:19.780
So the laser is out here,

182
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.290
this long rectangle in the box,

183
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:28.420
and the light beam then goes down the optic fiber glass fiber

184
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.360
into the box where you kept it.

185
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:36.310
But what is really important is the purity of the water.

186
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:41.440
So these big boxes here are continuous purification of the

187
00:12:41.441 --> 00:12:43.540
water and cooling of the board.

188
00:12:43.541 --> 00:12:47.110
So because the heating of the laser generates a lot of heat.

189
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:50.680
So you have water purification, laser,

190
00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.050
and the actual cutting is here in the box.

191
00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:01.410
