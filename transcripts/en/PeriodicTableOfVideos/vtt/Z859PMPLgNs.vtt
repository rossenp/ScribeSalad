00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.890
<v 0>The 2014 Nobel prize for chemistry is a bit</v>

2
00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:09.750
unusual this year. If you're a regular viewer of our videos,

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.280
you're probably used to the fact that the chemistry Nobel prize can sometimes be

4
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:16.440
a bit more biological and chemical,

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.320
but this Nobel prize is really using almost

6
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:27.180
physics to study biology, but with a chemical twist to it,

7
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.010
the idea of the prize is it's gone to three scientists who have

8
00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:36.510
devised a way of looking inside biological sales

9
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.060
with microscopy very much better with much greater detail

10
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.500
than has been possible before. And not only looking inside cells,

11
00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:51.330
but looking inside living cells. So you can actually see them working.

12
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.410
Although it's a bit of physics, it's not too complicated.

13
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.000
So let me explain the problem.

14
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.990
The problem is that light is a wave.

15
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.700
If you're trying to look at very small objects, there is a limit.

16
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.890
If you just have a microscope with lenses to the size of the

17
00:01:10.891 --> 00:01:14.430
object, you can see because as the object gets smaller,

18
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.940
comparable or smaller than the wavelength of light,

19
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.410
it just becomes fuzzier and fuzzier. And eventually you can't see it at all.

20
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.300
And the usual way to approach this is that you use instead of light,

21
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.800
you use electron beams where the wavelength is very, very short.

22
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.750
So the object is still bigger than the wavelength of the electrons.

23
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.870
The trouble is that the electrons,

24
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.950
when they have a short wavelength have enormously high energy.

25
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.890
And so if you look at the biological cell,

26
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.770
even if it wasn't dead beforehand,

27
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.360
as soon as you stopped shining electrons on it, it dies.

28
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.020
So you have no hope looking at living things,

29
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.390
and you can't start shining electron beams into the brains

30
00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:05.130
of living organisms.

31
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.150
Let alone humans they're just dies right away.

32
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.070
These prizes, which have been awarded to one scientist in Germany,

33
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.810
Stephan hel two scientists in America, Eric bet,

34
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.000
SIG and William Myrna and Betsy can learn a used

35
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.230
one approach based on fluorescent proteins.

36
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.170
You will remember that a Nobel prize.

37
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.090
I think it was in 2008 was awarded for green

38
00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:40.950
fluorescent proteins. And this is taking it if you like one step further.

39
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.290
And the other, um, technique was developed by, um,

40
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.990
Stephen Hill and involves lasers.

41
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.760
The idea is that you have a cell with something inside it

42
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.100
that you would like to image. And the thing you want to image is smaller,

43
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.730
the wavelength of light.

44
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.840
So if you can see any detail lens side the sale,

45
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.000
it will just be one blur on top of another the idea and not all the scales of

46
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:11.470
this demonstration, right?

47
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.210
Because I wasn't expecting this Nobel prize and I've just got some

48
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:17.980
objects lying around my office,

49
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.410
but you take one laser which produces a spot that is determined

50
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:27.010
by the wavelength of light. If in the cell,

51
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.120
there is something that fluoresces that is when you shine a light,

52
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.180
it gives out a different wavelength of light.

53
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.420
So you shine on green and it gives that red light.

54
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.850
Then the blob of red light that comes out will be the

55
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:46.060
same size as the spots of green light that you're signed on it,

56
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.610
but it will be much more intense in the center of the spot. Then at the edges,

57
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.120
what Stephan hel discovered,

58
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.830
at least I believe this is what he discovered is that if you use two lasers at

59
00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:00.490
once,

60
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.260
that's a red one and a green one and got the spots to coincide,

61
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.150
which I can't easily do that the red spot

62
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.110
would suppress. Most of the

63
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.070
fluorescence caused by the green one so that the fluorescence became much

64
00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:22.840
sharper, so small,

65
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.970
that it could then be used to scan across the cell and see the

66
00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:29.980
image at much better resolution.

67
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.720
I think what's happens is that the second laser,

68
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.580
and I don't know what the wavelengths are.

69
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.050
I just haven't here to use green and red is that the second laser

70
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.540
stops fluorescence from the part of the first beam where the light is not so

71
00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:50.770
intense, but where in the middle, the first beam is really intense.

72
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.090
Then the second laser can't stop it. The other two,

73
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.220
they were working not together,

74
00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.140
but one of the work miRNAs work stimulated breadstick,

75
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.880
and then back again so that they were working like a arguing

76
00:05:06.881 --> 00:05:10.000
couple almost. So that one had an idea and then the other,

77
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.740
but there's involved the fluorescence of just individual

78
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:15.760
molecules.

79
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.380
And apparently the key breakthrough came with the fact that with the

80
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.270
green fluorescent protein, this is a protein which when you shine it with light,

81
00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:30.100
it fluoresces, it only fluoresces a certain number of times.

82
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.580
So if you hit it with light the first time,

83
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.000
it then starts fluorescing and it gives that light.

84
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.840
And you can repeat this perhaps 10 times and then it stops.

85
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.070
Then you have to shine a different colored light and you can switch it on again.

86
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.700
And then by quite a complicated process,

87
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:53.290
which I don't entirely understand is by using

88
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.740
different colored fluorescent proteins, yellow, red,

89
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.760
green, and hitting it with a laser,

90
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.680
making it fluoresce,

91
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.870
then letting it go quiet because it's switched off and then

92
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:10.040
switching it on again,

93
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.900
you can build up a picture of the inside of the cell,

94
00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.670
a very great resolution.

95
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.920
I think even without understanding all

96
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:24.530
the details of how they did it,

97
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.540
the fact that now one can look inside living

98
00:06:29.541 --> 00:06:34.160
cells and see things going on that nobody's ever been able to see

99
00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:34.994
before.

100
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.740
Since the invention of the microscope is obviously a wonderful

101
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:43.220
discovery and something which

102
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.560
nobody I think would argue isn't worthy of a Nobel prize.

103
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.810
It may be that this particular year

104
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.880
with the blue led going to physics and this

105
00:06:58.881 --> 00:07:02.300
microscopy going to chemistry that if had been choosing,

106
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.920
I might've put them the other way round because there's a lot of chemistry in

107
00:07:06.921 --> 00:07:10.460
the led and a lot of physics in the microscopy,

108
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.580
but who are we to argue with the Swedish Academy?

109
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.330
They understand Nobel prizes better than anybody else.
