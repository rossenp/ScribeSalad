00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.320
<v 0>So now I'm going to show you Rahman's collection of minerals.</v>

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.990
Lots of people had collections of minerals,

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.520
but his is special because he collected them all personally.

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.410
And so brought them back here. So there is his own character.

5
00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:19.110
If you like in his choice of things that he collected,

6
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.370
let's go and see some of them. There's an well drink.

7
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.260
Number of things to see.

8
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.080
And one of the first things which is really very special is over

9
00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:35.280
here. When ramen first moved into this Institute,

10
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.930
there was never electricity.

11
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.030
So he had this special device to reflect the sun of this mirror

12
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.920
into the room. But as you know,

13
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.340
the sun moves round as the time of day,

14
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.070
but there's a special clock here and a system of leavers so

15
00:00:53.071 --> 00:00:55.620
that as the sun moves,

16
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.520
the mirror moves to keep the sun shining into the room.

17
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.870
So let's go and look at some of the samples. I'll just show you a few.

18
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.300
Whichever ones looked really interesting. So he looks really wise.

19
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.673
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

20
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.490
<v 0>Sting pearls, which come from oysters. As you know,</v>

21
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.950
ramen was very interested in the scattering of light and the

22
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.960
silvery color of pearls is due to the scattering of light between the

23
00:01:32.961 --> 00:01:36.080
layers of calcium carbonate.

24
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.760
That's laid down in the Pearl here. There are all sorts of,

25
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.620
um, gemstones, um, Jade from China

26
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.850
samples from Brazil, he traveled all over the world,

27
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.540
Cortes Silicon dioxide [inaudible]

28
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.540
, which contains inside it. Some liquid that was trapped during the geological process using light, which can shine through this. He could find out what the liquid was without damaging the crystal. And he showed that the liquid was water with a mixture of carbon dioxide and neat 

29
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.540
vain

30
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.540
. So if you think about it's really quite clever without damaging the crystal, you can find out what's inside. There's really nice story about this piece. Of 

31
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.540
course

32
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.373
, he got it from a farmer who brought it to sell it to him and he bought it and then discovered about the liquid afterwards.

33
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.620
Otherwise the farmer would probably ask for a lot more money here.

34
00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:43.550
There are opals. Again, the color is due to the scattering of light.

35
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.550
Something that fascinated Roman over here.

36
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.270
There's some things which are very interesting,

37
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.910
but actually rather ordinary stuff.

38
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.460
So up here are these really nice

39
00:02:58.461 --> 00:03:01.480
crystals and they are sugar.

40
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.600
Normally we see tiny crystals of sugar.

41
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.680
I've never seen such big crystals of sugar in my life.

42
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.180
I've got quite small hands,

43
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.230
but they're still quite big and even bigger down here. Uh,

44
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.120
two salt crystals.

45
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.490
These are natural soap crystals that ramen collected from a

46
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.340
soap mine in Poland. And up here,

47
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.820
they're rather nice crystals of copper sulfate over here.

48
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.180
We have some nice samples of sulfur.

49
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.160
I've got a small sample at home,

50
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.830
but it doesn't look anything as beautiful as this.

51
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.670
And presumably this came from somewhere full Canik.

52
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.733
<v 1>And these.</v>

53
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.090
<v 0>Samples here have especially interesting story.</v>

54
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.400
These are artificial crystals.

55
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.220
Apparently there was a power cut.

56
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.080
The electricity went off for several days and not far from here,

57
00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.790
there is a steelworks or there was where they made steel

58
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:03.490
continuously in very hot furnaces.

59
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.800
But when the electricity stopped,

60
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.900
ramen realized that the furnaces would stop and they might be good crystals

61
00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:15.490
there. So he rushed off and before they could start up the furnaces again,

62
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.210
he got these really nice crystals of copper random.

63
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.190
So now I want to show you the thing that I find the most moving in

64
00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:26.770
the whole of this display over here. Uh,

65
00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:31.330
two stones that come from the center of

66
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.350
Hiroshima,

67
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.330
the city that was attacked with the first ever atom

68
00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:41.710
bomb. And these are pieces of mineral that have melted.

69
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.600
The melting point is about 1800 degrees

70
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:47.650
centigrade.

71
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.990
And they apparently melted in the center of Hiroshima.

72
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.120
Ramen was given these pieces of stone by the city of Hiroshima in

73
00:04:58.121 --> 00:05:02.740
recognition of his active opposition of the use of

74
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:03.910
nuclear weapons,

75
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.340
but he was quite careful and he said, send them to me.

76
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.140
And then he had them tested for radioactivity before he added them to his

77
00:05:14.141 --> 00:05:14.974
collection.

78
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.130
<v 1>In here, we have series of things.</v>

79
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.370
<v 0>Samples of rock that don't look particularly special,</v>

80
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.090
but above them are some UV lamps.

81
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.550
And if we switch out the light with, um, the visible light,

82
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.140
then suddenly you see something really quite interesting

83
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.600
that all these minerals begin to glow and they glowed because

84
00:05:42.601 --> 00:05:44.970
they are absorbing UV light.

85
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:50.280
And then some of the energies lost inside the crystal structure and

86
00:05:50.281 --> 00:05:53.130
they emit visible light in here.

87
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.040
Some Ruby and the large lamp in the middle is artificial

88
00:05:58.041 --> 00:06:02.570
synthetic Ruby, and the little bits roundabouts and natural Ruby.

89
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.100
And you can see that the natural rupee fluoresces very nicely,

90
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.900
whereas the artificial stuff doesn't this

91
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.750
sample here is interesting.

92
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:19.520
Something I've never seen this rather gray mineral is called Crusader light.

93
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.880
And it is what asbestos is made from.

94
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.090
You've probably heard that as best as fibers,

95
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.010
these very fine fibers that we used for installation can be breathed in

96
00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:32.150
and cause cancer.

97
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.170
This sample is what asbestos is made from.

98
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.240
And because it's dangerous,

99
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.140
I'm not going to pick it up just as we would going Shashi,

100
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:47.060
who is the curator of this museum produced another

101
00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:48.320
treasure for us.

102
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.790
These are natural diamonds for optical windows,

103
00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:57.560
which give you very strong windows that you can use for high pressure vessels

104
00:06:57.561 --> 00:07:01.250
and so on. And look at the size. It's amazing.

105
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.680
I've seen diamond windows before, but never seen natural ones of this size.

106
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.810
These are natural diamonds,

107
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.260
which have been chopped to give you a slice with this.

108
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:17.330
So the actual diamond itself must've been very much bigger and diamonds of

109
00:07:17.331 --> 00:07:19.520
that size are extremely valuable.

110
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.840
So this is the citation.

111
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:28.520
And here is you can perhaps guess is the metal.

112
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.920
Whenever he saw something interesting, a flower, a rock, whatever.

113
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:38.300
He could look through this and see the spectrum.

114
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.370
<v 2>Hello, everyone. Welcome back to objectivity. Of course I'm wearing gloves,</v>

115
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.840
but you know, we win in business today because Keith is wearing gloves.

116
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.460
Wow.
