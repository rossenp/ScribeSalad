00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.600
<v 0>Hi, everyone. You might know. It's 10 years since our first upload.</v>

2
00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:07.950
And hopefully you've watched professor Poliakoff top 10 video list.

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.061
If you have,

4
00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:12.750
you may have come here and I'm going to name my top 10 from the other side of

5
00:00:12.751 --> 00:00:13.440
the camera.

6
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.340
And the only caveat is I'm not going to name any that were on the professors

7
00:00:17.341 --> 00:00:18.750
list. So here we go.

8
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.700
Number one has to be our gold bully and volt video

9
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.380
at the time.

10
00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:29.460
No one had previously been allowed inside this Volk to film all the gold.

11
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.930
And I have to tell you, I'm sorry. It looked even more amazing in real life,

12
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.440
but all together, if you look at the bank's annual report,

13
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.490
it's worth 197 billion pounds.

14
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.760
What an incredible thing to see all that gold in one place,

15
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.350
really memorable experience. Next boiling water.

16
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.110
As we went to Everest base camp each night,

17
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.950
we'd boil water at a different altitude showing how the boiling point was

18
00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:58.110
changing as we got higher and higher.

19
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.710
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

20
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.020
<v 0>This was obviously a really amazing trip to do.</v>

21
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.870
I think the video turned out really pretty.

22
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.310
And the music from Alan Stewart was also right on point

23
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.350
Bit of a nostalgic one here, cesium the emperor of alkaline metals.

24
00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:26.840
We'd always talked about cesium reactions.

25
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.820
We've done quite a few over the years now,

26
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.320
but looking back at the early days when we first tried it with news, ingenious,

27
00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:34.250
contraptions,

28
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.790
and the excitement of not knowing what the cesium would do in the water.

29
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.140
<v 1>And let's see what happens ready, guys.</v>

30
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.750
<v 0>You might argue it was a bit of an anticlimax. I don't know.</v>

31
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.910
I still think it's an amazing thing to see,

32
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.790
and it brings back a lot of fond memories watching this video.

33
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.450
<v 1>Nice purple flair, really quite nice chemistry.</v>

34
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.440
<v 0>Another road trip. It'd be going to the mine,</v>

35
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.450
just outside Stockholm in Sweden that gave its name to four elements on the

36
00:02:11.451 --> 00:02:16.220
periodic table. This had a real sense of adventure.

37
00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:18.290
I think it may have been the first trip we ever did.

38
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.970
<v 1>We've reached the top</v>

39
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.180
left. Oh wow.

40
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.290
<v 0>And it really felt like we were chasing periodic table history.</v>

41
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.340
Another periodic video. Favorite is the barking dog reaction.

42
00:02:34.341 --> 00:02:37.220
We've done it numerous times in numerous ways,

43
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.320
but it wasn't until we got a really good,

44
00:02:39.321 --> 00:02:43.640
slow motion camera on it that we saw this chugging of the reaction front.

45
00:02:43.641 --> 00:02:44.870
As it went down the tube,

46
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.750
it was a bit of a surprise and really exciting to see it.

47
00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:50.390
We saw the reaction in a way we hadn't seen it before

48
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.730
another nostalgic one remembering the early days when all these reactions were

49
00:02:55.731 --> 00:03:00.190
new and exciting and we first dropped sodium in water, it went off with a bang.

50
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:01.540
We were having so much fun.

51
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.200
And then there was that candid moment when Pete and Neil realized some of the

52
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:08.440
sodium had come out of the action bottle onto my camera.

53
00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:10.120
And they noticed while I was filming,

54
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.490
it was something fun to include in the video.

55
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.533
<v 1>Oh.</v>

56
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.280
<v 0>I think we were all wearing safety specs.</v>

57
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.300
The people who know me may know I'm really into the Apollo moon landing.

58
00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:25.560
So this next video about a hypergolic reaction was really good fun.

59
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.450
This is the same reaction that was used to propel the lunar modules from the

60
00:03:33.451 --> 00:03:37.350
moon after they'd landed. It also had a really remarkable sound.

61
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.540
<v 1>And opening the switch.</v>

62
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.350
<v 0>And speaking of sound, my next choice is a video that was made for us by Dave,</v>

63
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.470
from boy and a band, a good friend, and a really clever guy.

64
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.000
And he came to the labs,

65
00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:58.980
recorded a whole bunch of sounds and turned it into this dubstep

66
00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.671
music track,

67
00:03:59.671 --> 00:04:02.670
which I thought was really ingenious and something really different on the

68
00:04:02.671 --> 00:04:03.504
channel.

69
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.450
We love doing reactions with things that are a little bit iconic,

70
00:04:12.451 --> 00:04:15.030
like say a cheeseburger or in this case,

71
00:04:15.031 --> 00:04:17.700
cans of Coke here and acid and alkali.

72
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.600
Not only did this look spectacular and way more interesting than we thought,

73
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.150
I love this candid reaction from Sam Tang.

74
00:04:24.151 --> 00:04:26.130
It really shows our enthusiasm for the product.

75
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.070
<v 1>I didn't expect it to be quite so. Wow.</v>

76
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.450
<v 0>Last, but certainly not least hot charcoal in liquid oxygen.</v>

77
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.660
This is a favorite of Neil. He loves doing it any chance he gets.

78
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.090
And when we pointed the slow motion camera on it,

79
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.620
we saw how beautiful it really was. One of the prettiest things.

80
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.500
<v 1>Thanks.</v>

81
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.590
<v 0>Very much for your support over 10 years, we really appreciate it.</v>

82
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.620
I'll include links on the screen to the top 10 lists.

83
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.410
The professor's earlier video, our Patrion.

84
00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:59.130
If you want to support the project as we go forward and hopefully there'll be

85
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.580
well. Who knows? Maybe another 10 years. Thanks for watching.

86
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.700
Do you know about the unmade podcast?

87
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.550
This is a podcast I make with an old school friend called Tim.

88
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.090
You really should check it out. I'll put links down in the description,

89
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.420
search the unmade podcast on your player of choice.

90
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.040
Or we also put them on YouTube.
