00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.430
<v 0>Are you ready guys</v>

2
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.980
areas with barely tape it. Wouldn't wouldn't be there now.

3
00:00:09.981 --> 00:00:13.820
And it wouldn't be the periodic table that we know today. Okay.

4
00:00:13.821 --> 00:00:17.180
So what we're doing today has made or so,

5
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.040
and I'm looking at the periodic table,

6
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.720
looks like an ordinary periodic table. You can take out the elements

7
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.910
we got here. Wow. Kevin is string.

8
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.470
You can imagine the periodic table, but like a family photograph.

9
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.340
There'd be some people who know very well and others where you kept in quick,

10
00:00:52.341 --> 00:00:56.420
you remembered what their name is, but you remember one or two facts about them.

11
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.990
Lecture, theaters, classrooms, all over the world,

12
00:01:02.991 --> 00:01:05.030
have periodic tables hanging in the,

13
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.720
you can buy vodka with Mandalay name on it,

14
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.840
actually produce and show you elemental flourish.

15
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.310
I've never seen so much gold. In fact, I've never seen so much of any elements

16
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.900
inserted the cube into the periodic table of the elements to the chemist.

17
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.100
I've liked to give him card

18
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.970
[inaudible] I'm in India.

19
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.770
I'm on the train going up the Koch about the mountain in Rio de

20
00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:48.860
Janeiro. Nice sunny weather in Stockholm.

21
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.510
Oh wow. I'm on Bondai beach in Sydney, Australia.

22
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.970
So when dumps starts in internally where they made six different super heavy

23
00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:11.390
elements, and I'm just going to show you how they did it,

24
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.260
trying to make literal translation. So the Ethiopians translation,

25
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.560
this is [inaudible] business card and you can see it's a

26
00:02:30.561 --> 00:02:31.394
fun.

27
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.990
I've been told that they need to take one of my has woo.

28
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.300
So each element we'd symbol is four microns across

29
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.670
everything is revealed three,

30
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.650
two, one.

31
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:53.683
Lovely.

32
00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.740
And I'm in the office of URI,

33
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.360
a goodness young after whom element 118

34
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.820
[inaudible] [inaudible]

35
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.890
[inaudible] whenever he was lecturing the reaction,

36
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.420
he would hold up his hand and say, I had a hand in that reaction.

37
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.340
So a chap called kit, actually.

38
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.580
[inaudible] yeah.

39
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.600
I also found my very first periodic table.
