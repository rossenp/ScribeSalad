1
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.360
<v 0>Okay. I think I am looking at the camera. It has a little light on it,</v>

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.910
so I can just watch that light.

3
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:11.700
Most of you around the world.

4
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.800
I'm in isolation here in my study in Nottingham,

5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.760
before I went into isolation, Brady,

6
00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:23.820
and I recorded some questions and answers.

7
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.310
And this little video is the last part of the recording we

8
00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:30.144
made,

9
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.550
but we've noticed that things up in my study so we can record new

10
00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:40.230
videos and they're all going to be coming up quite soon. But for now,

11
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.540
let's watch the last of the questions and answers that we recorded before

12
00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:46.800
all of this started.

13
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.100
<v 1>What is the stupidest thing you did in chemistry in your life?</v>

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.560
<v 0>I think the stupidest thing I did was when I was a school boy</v>

15
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.320
and I tried to distill formic acid out of oven cleaner in

16
00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:10.970
my parents' basement. I didn't look up the boiling point of formic acid,

17
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.740
but it's only one point something degrees above the boiling point of

18
00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:20.450
water. So separating them by distillation is pretty difficult,

19
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.940
but more stupidly.

20
00:01:22.941 --> 00:01:27.560
I did not put in any boiling beads into the

21
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.150
oven cleaner.

22
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.400
So I heated it up on an oil bath in my parents' basement.

23
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.470
And then suddenly I saw the temperature got very high to something like

24
00:01:39.471 --> 00:01:42.650
150 degrees without it boiling.

25
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.940
And I dropped in some beads and it all

26
00:01:46.941 --> 00:01:51.470
vaporized and clouds of acid vapor filled the

27
00:01:51.471 --> 00:01:55.640
basement and we all had to retreat. Did you get in trouble?

28
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.100
I don't think my parents noticed it.

29
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.720
<v 1>Okay. Have you seen breaking bad yet? No.</v>

30
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.350
Do you get asked about our lives?

31
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.750
<v 0>I occasionally get asked about it,</v>

32
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.230
but I don't subscribe to any sort of streaming service,

33
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.570
plain biscuits or chocolate chip. I don't eat biscuits all that much.

34
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.460
And, but I suppose I prefer chocolate chip to plain biscuits.

35
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.593
If I have to.

36
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.040
<v 1>What is the worst injury you have ever sustained in the pursuit of chemistry?</v>

37
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.480
<v 0>Touch wood?</v>

38
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.830
I have never injured myself seriously though.

39
00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:35.390
When I was a school boy,

40
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.900
we didn't wear gloves when we did chemistry.

41
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.270
And so my fingers were permanently stained yellow from

42
00:02:44.271 --> 00:02:49.220
nitric acid and which makes your skin yellow and it eventually

43
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.170
peels off. And also when I was learning to glass blow,

44
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.410
I wasn't very successful because even then my hands shook rather. Um,

45
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.750
I burnt myself several times.

46
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.980
I can remember traveling on the London underground,

47
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.530
the underground trains, um,

48
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.660
and putting my finger against the metal to try and

49
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:17.620
make it hurt less. As I was going home from school.

50
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.530
<v 1>What experiment do you wish all high school students would be required to</v>

51
00:03:22.531 --> 00:03:23.364
perform?

52
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.520
<v 0>I've never thought about that.</v>

53
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.220
I think the answer is that it doesn't really matter which experiments they

54
00:03:32.221 --> 00:03:36.690
perform, but it's good if they perform lots of experiments,

55
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.590
some students around the frightened when they get to the lamp.

56
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.120
And so the more experiments you can do,

57
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.790
the more confidence you will get.

58
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.070
I think the really important thing to say is that modern

59
00:03:53.071 --> 00:03:56.040
society relies on the use of chemicals.

60
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.080
And if we don't train young people to use chemicals

61
00:04:01.081 --> 00:04:05.190
safely, then when they are my age,

62
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.320
there will be nobody in the world who can handle chemicals and the whole thing

63
00:04:10.321 --> 00:04:11.220
will collapse.

64
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.980
So it's really important that people respect chemicals because they're often

65
00:04:16.981 --> 00:04:19.920
dangerous, but at the same time,

66
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.290
have the confidence to handle them safely.

67
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.050
<v 1>Are there any games you enjoy playing?</v>

68
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.790
<v 0>I used to play a little tennis, but I wasn't very good.</v>

69
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.340
When I was a child,

70
00:04:38.341 --> 00:04:43.200
I used to play Mahjong and I have a notice here in

71
00:04:43.201 --> 00:04:47.550
my office saying, don't play Marshawn with strangers.

72
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.660
You're sure to be cheated. I play some games with my grandchildren,

73
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.560
but they like to change the rules. So they, when do you play chess?

74
00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.180
I was very bad at chess. My father was very good.

75
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.010
I still have a chess set that he had as a child in Russia,

76
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.480
but it is missing one white Bishop

77
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.760
because he was playing it in the outside latrine and the

78
00:05:14.761 --> 00:05:18.300
white Bishop fell down into the cesspit, but low,

79
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.100
he was playing chess in the toilet. Well working out chess problems.

80
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.013
Okay.

81
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.350
<v 1>Have you ever played a video game or a computer game?</v>

82
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.170
<v 0>Um, I haven't, um,</v>

83
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.480
played any video games my children used to in the early days so-called

84
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.880
BBC computer and I did help devise

85
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.780
some computer games for chemists,

86
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.580
for high school children.

87
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.500
And we prayed this help and our colleagues in computer file.

88
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.790
We've actually got these on the internet so you can play them to yourself if

89
00:05:56.791 --> 00:05:58.190
you'd to. How.

90
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.080
<v 1>Popular were you in your school days?</v>

91
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.560
<v 0>I think probably not very popular.</v>

92
00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:10.780
And my brother who's younger than me went to the same school as me,

93
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.740
after I had left. And this friend said they were frightened of me.

94
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.160
Why would they be frightened of you? I have no idea.

95
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.150
Cause you're a chemist. What's your favorite color? I don't know.

96
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.280
Probably green after all. I am a green chemist. And what's your favorite number?

97
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:35.890
I don't know, but um, most people say seven as far as I remember,

98
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:41.260
but I suppose at the moment it's probably 150 because it's 150 years

99
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.790
of the periodic table when that's 151 and

100
00:06:45.791 --> 00:06:50.500
150 years of supercritical fluids, which was my big area of research.

101
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.610
Do you have any regrets? Everyone has regrets

102
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.510
except Edith PF. Who, if you remember her, the song

103
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:01.750
[inaudible], I don't

104
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:01.750
 regret anything, but on the other hand, sometimes things that one regrets, 

105
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:01.750
maybe

106
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:01.750
 better that they didn't happen because the consequences of them might not have been as good 

107
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:01.750
as one that

108
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:02.583
 mentions. But I think I'm very pleased about many things, particularly meeting Brady, of course.

109
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.350
<v 1>Did you ever meet Albert Einstein or Nikola Tesla?</v>

110
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.960
<v 0>The answer is no. And I think Einstein died when I was quite small.</v>

111
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:39.850
I think he died in 55 when I would have been sufficiently young.

112
00:07:39.851 --> 00:07:41.470
I wouldn't even know who he was.

113
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.600
<v 1>Have you ever been starstruck?</v>

114
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.390
<v 0>I'm not sure. I mean, they</v>

115
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:53.320
quite often when you meet somebody who's special

116
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:56.340
for one reason or another, it's quite difficult to see,

117
00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.810
think what you would say to them.

118
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.550
I've sometimes wondered what would they say? If I met Mendeleev,

119
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:08.530
who I think was actually quite an eccentric and antisocial person,

120
00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.700
I think as you get older, you tend to get less style struck.

121
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:18.220
And I'm quite embarrassed when people get star struck meeting

122
00:08:18.221 --> 00:08:19.054
me,

123
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.530
how can they be star struck about somebody is ordinary is me.

124
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.080
<v 1>Who's the most famous person you've met.</v>

125
00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:29.980
<v 0>Depends how you define fame. Most recently,</v>

126
00:08:29.981 --> 00:08:33.670
I suppose the president of China Xi, Jinping,

127
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:35.560
whom I shook hands with,

128
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:40.810
but we appear to have no language in common and I've

129
00:08:40.811 --> 00:08:43.120
met lots of Nobel prize winners,

130
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.590
and sometimes they're really quite conceited,

131
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:52.300
but very often they're delightfully modest and it's quite a privilege

132
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.340
to talk to them. Have you met the queen?

133
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.640
I've met the queen and Prince Charles who

134
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.080
asked me how green chemistry was going. You can see him on one of our videos.

135
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.850
<v 1>Have you ever worked with Fleurieu and tympanic acid?</v>

136
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:12.350
<v 0>The short answer is no. In fact, I've never worked with fluorine.</v>

137
00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:17.840
I did once work in some dis lab where they had an argon

138
00:09:17.841 --> 00:09:22.790
fluoride, laser contains Algon and fluorine inside

139
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:28.730
and it developed a leak and some of the fluorine

140
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.000
came out in the cooling water, into the lab,

141
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:37.760
in the form of HF hydrogen fluoride. And the smell was dreadful.

142
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.400
<v 1>Do you know any periodic jokes?</v>

143
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.970
<v 0>No, not apart from cliched ones.</v>

144
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.930
One of my colleagues like saying he has no chemical jokes,

145
00:09:47.931 --> 00:09:51.770
they all are gone, but, um,

146
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.050
I don't really like such nonsense.

147
00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.320
<v 1>Do you collect anything like stamps or rocks?</v>

148
00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:02.900
<v 0>I sometimes pick up nice stones on the beach or laying</v>

149
00:10:02.901 --> 00:10:07.880
around and I often give them to children who I know several children who

150
00:10:07.881 --> 00:10:12.620
like collecting stones and I collect books.

151
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.010
You take lots of photos of flowers, don't you? Yes.

152
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:20.180
My wife is very interested in flowers, so I take pictures for her.

153
00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:25.460
And I suppose in the last few years when I've got an iPhone and I like taking

154
00:10:25.461 --> 00:10:28.940
pictures of all sorts of strange things, but, um,

155
00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.620
what's the last thing you took a picture of?

156
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:35.150
The last thing I took a picture of is, um,

157
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.900
last thing I photographed was this,

158
00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.570
which is a sale for liquid Xenon.

159
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:48.770
Haven't used it for probably 30 years.

160
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.280
And it's also, if you're interested in such things,

161
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.400
it's got these red windows,

162
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:59.240
which are made from a material called KRS five,

163
00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:01.910
which is a mixture of titanium, iodide,

164
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.900
and bromate so it's quite dangerous to touch the windows.

165
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.640
Titanium is highly poisonous,

166
00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:12.620
but I took a picture of this because I'm giving a lecture in 10 days time and I

167
00:11:12.621 --> 00:11:13.820
needed to filter this.

168
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.240
<v 1>What do you think will be the next big breakthrough in chemistry that will</v>

169
00:11:17.241 --> 00:11:19.100
change how we live our daily lives?

170
00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:24.290
<v 0>I think the biggest change probably is greatly improved</v>

171
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.350
battery life at the moment,

172
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.800
the batteries that we have are good,

173
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.320
but they don't hold nearly enough charge.

174
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:38.390
Many people can't get through the day without their smart phone running down.

175
00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:43.400
And the really important thing is that if you could make batteries

176
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:48.290
hold perhaps twice or three times the charge per unit

177
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.260
weight of what is possible today,

178
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:55.600
then you could start making electric aircraft.

179
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.630
At least for short range flights,

180
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:03.640
the electric cars would become much more viable than they are.

181
00:12:03.641 --> 00:12:04.474
Now.

182
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:09.460
You may have heard the UK has declared few days ago that

183
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:14.410
no cars are going to be sold with petrol or diesel or

184
00:12:14.411 --> 00:12:17.830
hybrid engines in 2035,

185
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:20.620
which is only 15 years from now.

186
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.640
And my car is more than 10 years old now.

187
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:30.100
So we've really got to make major developments in battery

188
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:31.110
technology.

189
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:34.380
<v 1>How often do experiments work versus not work?</v>

190
00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.650
<v 0>We used to have a sign on our lab door,</v>

191
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:43.140
which was a quotation from the Nobel prize winner. Fred Sanger,

192
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:46.260
Fred Sanger is the only person who's ever won.

193
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:49.440
Two Nobel prizes in chemistry.

194
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.470
There's some people that have won two Nobel prizes,

195
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.990
but in different subjects and the quotation,

196
00:12:54.991 --> 00:12:59.910
which used to be glued to our lab door said most experiments that work.

197
00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:02.003
In fact,

198
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:06.360
if every experiment you do does work,

199
00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:11.010
perhaps it means you're not trying things that are adventurous enough,

200
00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.910
but what's really important about experiments.

201
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:18.180
You shouldn't just do them to see what happens,

202
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:23.760
but you sort of have some sort of hypothesis or idea of what's going to

203
00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:26.850
happen. And then that may not happen.

204
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.100
But Naples you to change your theory.

205
00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:34.350
<v 1>Is salt. Dissolving in water, a chemical reaction or a physical reaction.</v>

206
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:39.480
<v 0>It's a physical process because if you evaporate the water,</v>

207
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.140
you can get the salt back on the other hand,

208
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.840
if you drop a piece of sodium into water,

209
00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:50.460
you get chemical reaction and you get to the solution of sodium

210
00:13:50.461 --> 00:13:53.070
hydroxide. And when you evaporate,

211
00:13:53.071 --> 00:13:55.920
it you'll get a white solid rather than the metal.

212
00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.670
And you have to work quite hard to get the sodium back from it.

213
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:04.260
<v 1>How does the professor view the increasingly close relationship between science</v>

214
00:14:04.261 --> 00:14:05.094
and business?

215
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:05.910
<v 0>Well,</v>

216
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:10.770
of course it depends what the relationship is that has always been

217
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.400
a strong interaction between chemistry and industry.

218
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:19.710
And most of the chemists that we educate go into

219
00:14:19.711 --> 00:14:22.800
industry in some form or another industry,

220
00:14:22.801 --> 00:14:27.120
the chemistry using industry are our biggest customers for our product

221
00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:31.770
chemistry graduates. But I think that particularly now,

222
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:36.750
when society is faced with so many problems in terms

223
00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:38.970
of sustainability of chemistry,

224
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.930
supplying the chemical needs of future generations,

225
00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:46.920
it's really important for chemists to work with industry,

226
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:50.850
to make sure that we can continue supplying the chemicals that people

227
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.290
and they have had in my career.

228
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:59.300
Some really very good collaborations with industry and those

229
00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:04.100
collaborations are continuing. And I really enjoy working with industry,

230
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:09.650
but professor can sort of chasing the mighty dollar impede

231
00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.060
blue sky research,

232
00:15:11.061 --> 00:15:14.660
those sort of crazy ideas that aren't necessarily financially viable,

233
00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:17.990
but could open whole new avenues.

234
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:22.490
You don't have to do all your research with industry blue skies research in

235
00:15:22.491 --> 00:15:26.090
general can be playing sometimes be quite inexpensive.

236
00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.900
So even if you have an industrialist sponsored project,

237
00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.950
you can still try extra ideas and so on.

238
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:38.750
And I have had several really good ideas that have been

239
00:15:38.751 --> 00:15:42.710
inspired by spinoffs, from what I've done from industry.

240
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:47.480
Do you prefer coffee or tea, tea, green tea.

241
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:49.550
I don't like black tea very much.

242
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:53.180
And I used to be really addicted to coffee.

243
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:58.340
And then I went to China in 1998 when there was almost no coffee

244
00:15:58.341 --> 00:16:01.790
there and you had to drink green tea.

245
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:06.440
And after a week I came back addicted, why do you prefer green tea?

246
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:11.990
Green tea is really good because you can put the leaves in your cup

247
00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:17.150
and then you can add hot water to it all day. The same leaves,

248
00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.360
the same leaves and it's still viable.

249
00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.580
And if I drank as much coffee as I drink green

250
00:16:25.581 --> 00:16:28.850
tea, I will be seeking 10 times more.

251
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:33.770
I really enjoy answering your questions. So keep sending them.

252
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.210
But for the moment we're recording new footage

253
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:41.660
and you'll be seeing those videos soon.

254
00:16:41.661 --> 00:16:45.110
So keep watching at different speeds and from different.

255
00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:48.663
<v 3>[Inaudible]</v>
