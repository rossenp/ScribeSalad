00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.300
<v 0>Nitric acid is H I know three,</v>

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.490
it is a very strong acid so-called oxidizing acid.

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.620
It just made by the reaction of nitrogen oxides with water,

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.630
and it will dissolve all sorts of metals, as you will see.

5
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.880
Normally it comes,

6
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.980
dissolved in different strengths in water so-called dilute

7
00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:30.780
nitric acid, concentrated nitric acid, and then really strong,

8
00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:35.490
which is called fuming nitric acid, which we don't usually have in the lab.

9
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.140
I was inspired by a book called ignition,

10
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.690
which I heard about from, um, a YouTube comment.

11
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.000
It's really good book, um,

12
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.680
which talks about rocket fuels and mentioned that aniline the

13
00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:56.940
organic compound when mixed with red fuming nitric acid,

14
00:00:56.941 --> 00:01:01.470
which is very concentrated nitric acid spontaneously

15
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.300
burst into flames so-called hypergolic reaction.

16
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.480
So Neil didn't have any red fuming nitric acid, but he had some pretty strong,

17
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.250
concentrated nitric acid. So he tried the reaction in the test tube

18
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.240
And to begin with there was some popping noises,

19
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.540
but then as the aniline warmed up a bit,

20
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.110
it's really dead burst into flames.

21
00:01:48.111 --> 00:01:52.850
Rather smoky plane came out at the top of the test, too.

22
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.030
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

23
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.090
<v 0>So it rarely looked like a rocket,</v>

24
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.040
not a very big role kit, but it's always satisfying.

25
00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:34.100
When something you read in the book actually happened.

26
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.920
Neil's all time.

27
00:02:39.921 --> 00:02:44.900
Favorite experiment is the reaction between copper and nitric acid.

28
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.570
Neil likes this reaction because you get to different result with

29
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.260
concentrated acid and with dilute acid.

30
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.460
So for the demonstration,

31
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.900
he ran the two reactions side by side with

32
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.530
concentrated next to dilute.

33
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:20.910
And if you watch,

34
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.070
you'll see the concentrated reaction goes very quickly.

35
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.950
Clouds of Brown gas,

36
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.810
which is the oxide and new to nitrogen dioxide,

37
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.830
and the solution goes deep, greenish color,

38
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.410
violent public.

39
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.670
On the other hand that they use reaction goes a lot slower.

40
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.220
The dilute reaction was in fact so slow that Brady wasn't

41
00:03:50.221 --> 00:03:54.990
convinced anything was happening, but then it did start to get going.

42
00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.000
And the solution started going around the pale blue with some

43
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.550
babbling and Neil decided to jazzy start by adding a bit more acid.

44
00:04:05.551 --> 00:04:07.800
So it went rather more concentrated.

45
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.550
And then the reaction went much better.

46
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.130
The solution went to much darker blue,

47
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.490
and there were a few traces of Brown gas.

48
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.620
That is an O two,

49
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.740
but the dilute reaction produces an ow rather than a new tooth.

50
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.340
The reason that Neil likes this reaction so much is that

51
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.460
it was done at school by his school teacher.

52
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.290
And he was the only boy in the class who wrote down the

53
00:04:58.291 --> 00:05:01.200
equations for the two reactions correctly.

54
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.580
We've given you the equations as well, so you can see them. Now,

55
00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:10.560
the third demonstration is based on the English two

56
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.880
Pence coin, which most people call the two P coin,

57
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.550
which used to be made at copper.

58
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.370
And now because copper is become much more expensive is

59
00:05:23.371 --> 00:05:27.360
made out of iron with a coating of copper.

60
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.930
So I had the idea that we could try reacting a

61
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.490
two Pence piece with concentrated nitric acid.

62
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.400
You know, we enjoy destroying coins or at least reacting them

63
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.353
chemically.

64
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.550
But the reason here is that copper dissolves and

65
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.390
concentrated nitric acid. You've just seen it dissolving,

66
00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.090
but iron is passive [inaudible] that is,

67
00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:00.920
it reacts a small amount.

68
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.050
And then the surface gets a coating. And the reaction stops.

69
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.910
Neil tried the experiment before Brady arrived in Nottingham

70
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.960
and it worked perfectly copper dissolved,

71
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.240
and he was left with an iron coin that looked more or less the same as the

72
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:23.420
copper one. You could see all the writing and everything else.

73
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.030
Then when Brady arrived, Neil tried to, to gain,

74
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.830
There was a much small, violent reaction,

75
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.730
Took the coin out. It was really thin.

76
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.060
The picture of her majesty,

77
00:07:13.061 --> 00:07:18.040
the queen was just a vague shadow of her normal self,

78
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:22.960
almost gone. So Neil decided to do to gain,

79
00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.600
and he repeated the experiment.

80
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.790
<v 1>The reaction happens.</v>

81
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.400
<v 0>And this time the coin came out just as we</v>

82
00:07:42.401 --> 00:07:44.770
expected copper was gone,

83
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.890
but the iron and the picture of the queen was there.

84
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:53.170
So there was an extra twist to the second

85
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:58.000
experiment because Brady was a

86
00:07:58.001 --> 00:08:00.790
bit slow with his equipment to go and put it next to the other.

87
00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.780
<v 1>And let me stop. These Neal took the coin,</v>

88
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.200
waited before rinsing it

89
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.230
while he waited.

90
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:35.080
<v 0>Some of the solution of copper nitrate reacted</v>

91
00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:39.880
with the iron and put some clean copper

92
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.420
coating back onto the surface of the coin.

93
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:48.490
So there was the iron queen with a copper block next to

94
00:08:48.491 --> 00:08:51.220
her, which chemically is quite fun.

95
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.730
But the thing which fascinated me and of

96
00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.310
Braden Neal was way on earth.

97
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.280
The first experiment had failed.

98
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:07.500
Why did the queen dissolve and watching the

99
00:09:07.501 --> 00:09:08.334
video?

100
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:13.740
I noticed that the volume of nitric acid in the

101
00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:18.240
first experiment was much smaller than in the second experiment.

102
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.490
And I decided that perhaps the solution had got hot and the

103
00:09:23.491 --> 00:09:27.810
passivation reaction only happens with

104
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:32.400
cold nitric acid. If you have very hot nitric acid,

105
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:36.420
it can dissolve away the coating and keep reacting with the iron.

106
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.550
So what we decided to do was this was long

107
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:44.100
after Brady had left Nottingham.

108
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:49.920
I persuaded Neil to do a control experiment where

109
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:54.540
he did two reactions side by side with

110
00:09:54.541 --> 00:09:58.200
exactly the same amount of concentrated nitric acid,

111
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:03.540
but one starting at 50 degrees centigrade and the other room temperature.

112
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:08.190
And when he dropped in the coins simultaneously,

113
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.900
there was a modest reaction from the cold nitric acid.

114
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:18.390
But the whole nitric acid really bubbled away,

115
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.740
very vigorously.

116
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:24.570
And the temperature nearly doubled went from

117
00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.230
50 degrees to nearly a hundred degrees.

118
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.150
I think it was 96.

119
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:33.570
So when he took the coins out,

120
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:38.340
the one from the cold acid looked really nice.

121
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:43.290
You could see all of the engravings, but on the other coin,

122
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:47.760
it was largely dissolved away. And the thin wafer.

123
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:53.070
So it turned out I was right and I can't

124
00:10:53.071 --> 00:10:56.340
claim to be, have thought of it all myself,

125
00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.780
because I did look in the book about the reactions of iron and nitric acid.

126
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.570
And it mentioned cold nitric acid,

127
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.250
but I worked out why that might have been the temperature difference.

128
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:14.130
But I think this is really quite a good example of how science is

129
00:11:14.131 --> 00:11:17.370
done. You come up with a hypothesis,

130
00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.770
an idea of what might happen,

131
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:24.090
and then you try and experiment with a prediction.

132
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.780
The hot one should react more than the cold one,

133
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:32.940
and you test it to see if it works. And if it hadn't worked,

134
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.690
we would have had to come up with another explanation.

135
00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.750
Professor is nitric acid dangerous. Yes.

136
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.870
And it's very corrosive.

137
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:47.490
It tends to react with skin to make it yellow.

138
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.440
When I was at school,

139
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.800
when safety regulations were not as strong as they are,

140
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:59.230
I did a lot of experiments with concentrated nitric

141
00:11:59.231 --> 00:12:00.064
acid.

142
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:04.840
And my fingers were almost permanently staying yellow

143
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.340
from the nitric acid. And the skin goes yellow.

144
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.590
And after a bit, it peels off,

145
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:17.290
but it's not a dangerous injury, but nevertheless,

146
00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:21.610
I'd get quite worried. If our students had yellow fingers.

147
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.340
Did your parents ever say anything to you like Martin?

148
00:12:24.341 --> 00:12:27.700
Why are your fingers always yellow? No, they didn't.

149
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.420
And even more important, they didn't think I'd been smoking,

150
00:12:31.421 --> 00:12:32.740
which they might have done.

151
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.360
I think they just thought he's a chemist and this was par for the course.

152
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:46.170
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>
