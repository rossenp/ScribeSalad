00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.690
<v 0>No, of course the most famous thing about helium or at least the thing that</v>

2
00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:09.690
most people know is if you breathe in helium,

3
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.070
it makes your voice change makes it go squeaky.

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.840
I've never tried this.

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.460
So I decided they'd be rather fun to try this time

6
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.110
with Neil and Brady helping me nervous then.

7
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.540
Um, no, I'm not nervous yet. Well, I am nervous.

8
00:00:32.541 --> 00:00:37.400
I just read on Wikipedia that somebody died off the breathing

9
00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:38.330
helium, but

10
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.250
I hope it won't happen now to make a good fit here. If it does.

11
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.463
<v 1>Hello.</v>

12
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.370
<v 0>No, don't get with helium in my voice and it quickly goes away.</v>

13
00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.560
And the first time I did it, I didn't breathe deeply enough.

14
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.840
So my voice didn't change very much,

15
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.430
but the second time it did change really quite

16
00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:08.390
significantly.

17
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.950
Kara hadn't written 15 more videos to watch. In fact,

18
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.190
there are 117 to watch

19
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.300
was that it's different when you're doing it.

20
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.880
It just feels as if you're talking normally,

21
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.920
but somehow your voice comes out differently. I suppose.

22
00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:36.920
It's like when you have a very bad cold or something like that,

23
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.690
that your voice changes as well.

24
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.580
I don't think that this is a good experiment for you to try yourselves.

25
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.180
I don't think it's dangerous if you do just once,

26
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.370
but if you keep on breathing helium, it can be really quite dangerous.

27
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.800
And in fact, I read recently about somebody who died after breathing too much,

28
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.350
but if you breathe helium under controlled conditions,

29
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.810
it's quite safe. And in fact,

30
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.770
it's used for deep sea divers. One of the problems,

31
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.720
if you're diving very deep under the sea is that you have to

32
00:02:14.721 --> 00:02:17.090
breathe air that's under pressure.

33
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.160
Otherwise you can't open and shut your lungs under pressure.

34
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.910
The nitrogen in the air dissolves in your blood.

35
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.140
Now this doesn't matter when you're down at the bottom,

36
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.040
but as you come up, if you surface too quickly,

37
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.200
the nitrogen can come out as bubbles in your blood and

38
00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:43.970
cause a very painful condition wit for some reason that Dave is

39
00:02:43.971 --> 00:02:48.230
called the bends and it's been found that if you replace the

40
00:02:48.231 --> 00:02:51.350
nitrogen in the devas breathing out,

41
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.230
or at least most of the nitrogen with helium,

42
00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.010
then they don't suffer from bends below 150. The pressure.

43
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.510
<v 2>On the body rises dramatically and divers must operate on a mixture of helium</v>

44
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:05.403
and oxygen.

45
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.190
<v 0>But of course their voices go squeaky.</v>

46
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.850
So the people on the other end of the telephone,

47
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.800
talking to the divers need to have some sort of electronic filter

48
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.390
so that the divers voices are transposed and they can still understand what

49
00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:22.224
they're saying.

50
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.150
The reason why your voice changes is probably due to a number of factors.

51
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.070
One of the factors is that the speed of sound is much greater in

52
00:03:32.071 --> 00:03:34.080
helium than it is in air.

53
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.090
The reason for this is that the speed of sound is related to the

54
00:03:39.091 --> 00:03:42.930
mass of the molecules in the gas that the sound is going through.

55
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.880
And the helium molecule is much lighter than nitrogen or oxygen,

56
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.600
which you find in air. Of course, if you breathe hydrogen,

57
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.470
it would be even faster, the speed of sound,

58
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.420
but you then blow yourself up.

59
00:03:57.421 --> 00:04:00.780
So this is not something that anybody should try.

60
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.400
The other point is that inside the

61
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.580
human head or in fact, the head of all animals,

62
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.890
there are complicated resonances caused by the different spaces.

63
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.300
And that's why your voice changes when you have a cold,

64
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.250
because some of the tubes are blocked.

65
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.190
So I had the idea that perhaps if you

66
00:04:26.191 --> 00:04:29.310
put an iPhone playing music and helium,

67
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.000
that the sound might change though.

68
00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:36.720
There isn't much to resonate in an iPhone.

69
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.600
Neil and Brady were quite keen to try.

70
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.420
And our first experiments with a small plastic bag were a

71
00:04:51.421 --> 00:04:53.370
bit of a failure. So they,

72
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.410
Neil got a really big plastic bag and filled it with helium.

73
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.470
And when you put it over the iPhone,

74
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.570
most surprisingly the notes didn't change,

75
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.950
but the sound was attenuated much more.

76
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:24.030
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

77
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.940
<v 0>So it sounded much quieter.</v>

78
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.520
I'm not sure why this is, but it was quite a striking effect.

79
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.030
And Neil put the bag on and off.

80
00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:58.763
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

81
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.190
<v 0>And you could hear the music getting louder when the bag was not there and going</v>

82
00:06:06.191 --> 00:06:07.930
quieter again. When he puts it back,

83
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.240
We did a control experiment with a bag of air and it wasn't the bag.

84
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.620
It definitely was the helium,

85
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.060
but the thing I liked best was that Neil then let go of the bag and it went up

86
00:06:25.061 --> 00:06:27.580
to the ceiling and stayed there,

87
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.110
even though the bottom of the bag was completely open.

88
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.580
So once the helium is trapped in an upturn plastic bag,

89
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.160
it will sit there for quite a long time.

90
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.630
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

91
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:57.610
<v 0>Because helium is an inert gas because it has two electrons</v>

92
00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.690
that are paired.

93
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:04.240
It doesn't form conventional chemical compounds in the way that

94
00:07:04.241 --> 00:07:06.430
say hydrogen does or sodium,

95
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:12.460
but there's a very recent paper published just a few months

96
00:07:12.461 --> 00:07:17.290
ago in this journal here where you can see it says

97
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.790
noble gas compounds when helium met

98
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.770
sodium and the people here have done a really extraordinary

99
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.870
experiment where they mixed sodium metal and helium gas in a

100
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.030
diamond anvil cell.

101
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.110
We have a video that explains how these work,

102
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.030
but in these cells you can get really high pressures.

103
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:44.350
In their case,

104
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.180
they went up to a pressure of nearly 3 million

105
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.740
atmospheres, 3 million times higher than atmospheric pressure.

106
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.190
And when they did this,

107
00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:02.560
they found remarkably that sodium metal

108
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.930
forms a compound with helium, where there is helium,

109
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.420
which is still chemically neutral,

110
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:14.050
not helium plus or helium minus and sodium.

111
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.230
And in the lattice between them,

112
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:22.600
there are two electrons which are sitting there now,

113
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:27.220
normally in certain metal because the, um,

114
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:30.970
it's a metal, the electrons are,

115
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.990
if you'd like smear doubt delocalized through the structure.

116
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.040
And that's what gives it its metallic properties.

117
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:44.230
But in this sold NH two helium,

118
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.750
two sodium atoms, rich helium atom,

119
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:50.860
the electrons are localized and they predicted,

120
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.770
but they weren't able to observe the actually under these pressures,

121
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.880
the sodium and helium mixture should become transparent.

122
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.180
So it's really quite exciting.

123
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:07.650
So if your teachers tell you that helium doesn't form

124
00:09:07.651 --> 00:09:11.820
compounds, they're both right and wrong. They're right,

125
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.020
because it doesn't form compounds under normal conditions,

126
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:21.330
but they're wrong because at 3 million atmospheres, yes, you can get some,

127
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.190
the reason why there's helium in the sun is partly

128
00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:30.870
because the nuclear reactions that take place in the sun

129
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.680
are responsible for creating helium,

130
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:39.270
hydrogen atoms under these enormously high pressures and

131
00:09:39.271 --> 00:09:40.104
temperature.

132
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:45.510
The hydrogen atoms can fuse together by a process called

133
00:09:45.511 --> 00:09:47.790
fusion to generate helium.

134
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.090
Now under normal circumstances,

135
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.230
it's not possible to do this on earth,

136
00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:58.920
but if you take a nuclear bomb,

137
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.260
you can use an atom bomb to trigger the fusion

138
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.680
of usually deuterium and tritium.

139
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:12.750
These are isotopes of hydrogen and they can be made to

140
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.430
fuse to create.

141
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:19.190
<v 4>On this rather unimpressive barge floating in the beginning of the gun,</v>

142
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.601
rested the device,

143
00:10:20.601 --> 00:10:24.410
which carried the hopes for a large step forward and the weapons development

144
00:10:24.411 --> 00:10:25.244
program.

145
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.200
The distance of the camera aircraft is 50 miles.

146
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.400
The frame size of the picture is 14 by 18 miles.

147
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.460
The film is running at normal speed.

148
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:48.680
<v 0>There is also hope that you can do controlled</v>

149
00:10:48.681 --> 00:10:53.570
fusion in reactors called Taka max,

150
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:58.880
where eventually it may be possible to use the fusion of

151
00:10:58.881 --> 00:11:03.740
hydrogen atoms to make helium as a way of generating

152
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:08.480
very clean electricity. However,

153
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:12.590
experiments have been going on for most of my lifetime.

154
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.620
And although the results are promising,

155
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:20.180
they're nowhere near being commercial production of electricity.

156
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:25.280
The most common isotope of helium is helium four with two

157
00:11:25.281 --> 00:11:27.440
protons and neutrons.

158
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.550
There is a very rare isotope helium three,

159
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:36.620
which has two protons and one neutron and the

160
00:11:36.621 --> 00:11:41.300
properties of liquid helium three are significantly

161
00:11:41.301 --> 00:11:45.110
different from the properties of liquid helium four,

162
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:49.160
because at the very low temperatures of these liquids,

163
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:54.430
that quantum effects become very important. In fact, I've read,

164
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:59.710
and I don't know if it's true that liquid helium three and liquid helium

165
00:11:59.711 --> 00:12:03.070
four are immiscible, they don't mix together,

166
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.930
which is really quite weird.

167
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:09.130
Helium three can also behave as a superfluid,

168
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.960
which means that it can creep upwards out of its

169
00:12:13.961 --> 00:12:17.470
container. Whereas normally we've,

170
00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:21.250
we put the liquid so tea into my cup, it stays there,

171
00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:24.730
but imagine if it crept up the sides and went out.

172
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:29.800
So helium is a really very exciting element.

173
00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:41.970
<v 1>Let me start with music.</v>
