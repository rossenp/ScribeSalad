1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.310
<v 0>It is one of the few elements that is more or less</v>

2
00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:06.690
totally useless.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.470
Protactinium is an element,

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.860
which is actually much more interesting than I expected.

5
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.360
The first interesting fact is that it is one of the elements whose

6
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:21.510
existence was predicted by mental layer.

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.640
You've probably all heard how Mendeleev predicted the existence of gallium and

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.590
scandium because there were holes in his periodic table and

9
00:00:31.591 --> 00:00:36.030
he also worked out that there was a hole between Thorim and

10
00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:39.420
uranium, where he felt there should be an element. Now,

11
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.370
the reason that people don't make such a fuss about protecting them

12
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.930
in the context of mental live is that protecting them was only really

13
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.850
tied down, discovered properly in 1918. Well,

14
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:55.740
after the death of men Mendeleev,

15
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.340
whereas he was here to celebrate gallium and scandium,

16
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.780
and that made him famous.

17
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.220
The problem with protecting him is that it exists in a

18
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:08.940
very, very small quantities in nature.

19
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.380
And it is called protecting him originally.

20
00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:18.060
It was called Pluto actinium because it decays by

21
00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:22.440
radioactivity to form actinium originally

22
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.360
because Mendeley didn't know about the, these series,

23
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.950
the length nights,

24
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.900
and actinides he put protactinium here.

25
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.520
So you would have after actinium you would have rim protecting him and then

26
00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:39.354
uranium.

27
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.520
And so he thought that the chemistry of protecting him would be

28
00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:46.230
similar to that of tantalum.

29
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.550
And it turns out that it is quite similar and that was how it was

30
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:51.540
isolated.

31
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.460
The chemical problem is that when people were looking

32
00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:58.080
at all Wars,

33
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.650
these are the minerals that contain metals,

34
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.690
the ores of uranium.

35
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.150
There was some radioactivity which suggested that there may be another

36
00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:13.890
element which could decay by emission of an alpha

37
00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:18.390
particle helium nucleus to make actinium.

38
00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:23.340
So it would jump two spaces to the left to make actinium

39
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.610
and the atomic number would go down by two.

40
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.600
The problem was how to isolate this material,

41
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.880
radioactive element from all the other radioactive elements that are

42
00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:38.340
found in minerals with uranium.

43
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.940
And as you probably know that radium and polonium,

44
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.700
we've also been isolated from these minerals.

45
00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:47.640
So there's a real mixture and it was the, um,

46
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.010
Austrian chemist physicist.

47
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.630
Lisa Meitner working in the Institute together with auto

48
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.480
Hahn who eventually in 1918,

49
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.990
found a chemical way of precipitating the

50
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:05.680
elements of this group. And at the same time,

51
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:07.390
as she precipitated those,

52
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.400
the ProTech Timonium was also precipitated because its chemistry was similar

53
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.470
and she found some sign of the radioactivity in that

54
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:19.390
material that should precipitated.

55
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.830
And that was deemed to be the discovery of protecting him.

56
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.860
And it was published in 1918.

57
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.260
They proposed the name pro two actinium everybody find it difficult,

58
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.480
say pro to actinium. So it quickly got contracted to protecting him.

59
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.970
That's very easy to say no,

60
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.350
but it's easier than pro to acting all the elements

61
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.150
above led in the periodic table have a degree of

62
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.350
radioactivity.

63
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.540
So if we had the lump of protecting him here,

64
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.610
it would be extremely dangerous in terms of it's retroactive to Cain,

65
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.110
the isotope that's the particular form of

66
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.340
protecting him.

67
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.560
That was discovered by Lisa Meitner had a half-life

68
00:04:11.561 --> 00:04:15.250
of, I think 32,000 years, a few years earlier,

69
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.750
the chemist Fagans discovered an isotope that had a

70
00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:24.580
half-life of only one and a half minutes, which was so short lived.

71
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.830
He called it the name volume, big firm brief. So it was brilliant.

72
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.400
And so that in a way was the first discovery of protecting

73
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.630
them. But it turns out that there is a custom that if

74
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.610
several different isotopes of an element to discovered whoever discovers the

75
00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:50.110
longest lived isotope wins and they're deemed the

76
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:50.944
discover,

77
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.750
there are two other parts that aspects I think interesting about protecting

78
00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.460
them. The first one is just like mental life said it does

79
00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:04.780
form an oxide, PA two Oh five. In fact,

80
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.960
this is its most staple compound. The second thing,

81
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.940
which is perhaps a more interesting fact for those of you who are real

82
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.400
nerds for the periodic table,

83
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.560
is that it is one of the occasions where the atomic

84
00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:25.480
weight of the element you can see here 231 point something is

85
00:05:25.481 --> 00:05:30.340
lower than the atomic weight of the element before it there's another quite

86
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.350
well-known pair here that potassium at 39 is

87
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.970
slightly lighter than argon, which is the element that precedes it.

88
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.690
So these inverted pairs meant that

89
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:45.251
unfortunately,

90
00:05:45.251 --> 00:05:49.720
mental life predicted the wrong atomic weight for protactinium

91
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.130
is 231. And he said it's 235,

92
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.620
which is still not a bad guess.

93
00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.530
There an attempt to make quite a large amount of it.

94
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.540
Many years ago in the UK,

95
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.890
where 60 tons of material were processed to make

96
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:10.370
125 grams of protactinium.

97
00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.600
And according to this book, the people,

98
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.260
people paid half a million dollars for the, um,

99
00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.150
starting material,

100
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.670
but they were only charging $3,000 a gram for what they made.

101
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.770
So if you do quick maths, you can see,

102
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.220
even before you count in the labor,

103
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.430
they made a loss on the material. Why were they making it?

104
00:06:36.431 --> 00:06:38.530
Then I have no idea.

105
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.630
It is used for the dating of

106
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.330
sediments at the bottom of the ocean.

107
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.370
People measure the ratio of the isotopes of protect Tinian and Thorim.

108
00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.040
And from the value of this ratio,

109
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:59.140
they can tell approximately how old the sediment is at the bottom of the sea.

110
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.560
So you can argue whether or not that is really a use.

111
00:07:02.561 --> 00:07:05.380
It is more perhaps an application than the use.
