1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.680
<v 0>I'm in the computer science building at the university.</v>

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.760
You might wonder what's a chemistry professor doing here.

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.610
And the answer is that 30 years ago, I had a mad idea.

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.190
My children had just started playing computer games and I suddenly

5
00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:25.050
thought, why don't we make computer games for chemistry?

6
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.620
I hired two school boys during the summer.

7
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.570
They made a floppy disc with the games on it,

8
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.970
just after that,

9
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.200
there was a conference of science teachers at Nottingham.

10
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.790
So I set up a little stall, selling the computer disks.

11
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.790
My children were sitting in my office. Do you?

12
00:00:47.791 --> 00:00:50.250
Plicating the desks as fast as they could.

13
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.500
And I was selling them for two pounds each and I got so much money in my

14
00:00:55.501 --> 00:01:00.030
pockets that they pockets gave away money, pulled that down.

15
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:04.740
My trouser legs. It's the only time I've earned real cash for the university.

16
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.630
And for 30 years I had the discs in my filing cabinet

17
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.740
and every so often they looked at it, nostalgically, convinced.

18
00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:18.150
I would never see the games again. And then a few weeks ago,

19
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.030
Steve Bagley from the computer.

20
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:25.650
Science came to my office and I showed him this desk and he

21
00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:29.430
said, I might be able to make it work. I have an old computer.

22
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.320
So now I'm here in computer science to go to Steve's office

23
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.450
to see if I can play the games from this desk on the computer.

24
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.490
I know in Steve Bagley's office in a computer science

25
00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:48.630
department, here is a BBC ma crew or BBC master.

26
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.640
<v 1>Well, this computer I spent too much money on eBay probably is the best.</v>

27
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.070
Now I like collecting or computers.

28
00:01:55.071 --> 00:01:58.160
Those of you who see me on computer file will probably see my collection.

29
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.480
I can see. So these are like a rarity like hen's teeth or operating.

30
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.410
BBC's pretty common stuff. So I think most BBC micros are pretty common.

31
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.510
These still these days they're in a lot of schools.

32
00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:10.700
So it's still a lot that survived. People collect them.

33
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.930
There was still a news controlling the sort of timetable displays on British

34
00:02:14.931 --> 00:02:17.720
railway stations of a dealer a few years ago. Steve,

35
00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:20.210
when someone gives you an old desk, what were you thinking?

36
00:02:20.211 --> 00:02:23.090
Like you've got no chance with a like that. It depends how it's been stored.

37
00:02:23.091 --> 00:02:26.330
Fortunately, Martin gave me, looked in pretty pristine condition,

38
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.870
but in his filing cabinet, sorry, I was pretty hopeful that it would work.

39
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.390
The dangers really are that it's been too hard.

40
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.330
It's been in a magnetic field or something, and it's wiped the information.

41
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.780
Sometimes the disc degrading or you get mold growing on them.

42
00:02:38.781 --> 00:02:43.070
But generally as long as you've still got the media and confined a drive that

43
00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:46.730
still works to play it. And you can usually try and get something off for years,

44
00:02:46.731 --> 00:02:50.420
you will be able to see the damage if not had, I've forgotten how to start.

45
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.990
Okay. So, um, I was the first season, put it into the district,

46
00:02:53.991 --> 00:02:58.400
which is just put it in drive, not push it in.

47
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.750
And then the little flat, Oh, it's sort of like, they see you use your ways.

48
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.620
You hold down shift and press the brake key in the let go brake.

49
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:07.810
And it starts up.

50
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.770
<v 0>This is a sound.</v>

51
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.490
<v 1>Computer was a lot more visceral in those days they made noises and they sort</v>

52
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:17.290
of, you heard them going. So.

53
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.450
<v 0>It's not quite centered on the screen, but.</v>

54
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.020
<v 1>Yeah, the monitor for the BBC micro died.</v>

55
00:03:22.021 --> 00:03:24.940
So I had to wire up a little circuit to plug it into my guitar.

56
00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:25.774
We won for terms.

57
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.870
<v 0>This is the welcome screen for our video games.</v>

58
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.790
The disc that you've actually got was they've got here,

59
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.300
was sponsored by the pharmaceutical company that then pharmaceutical companies

60
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.200
black.

61
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.730
So who made enough desks so that we could send one to every

62
00:03:44.731 --> 00:03:46.110
school in the country.

63
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.780
And the picture shows a stylized picture of a university campus.

64
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.610
This is meant to be the chemistry department and some people boating on the

65
00:03:56.611 --> 00:04:01.230
Lake. And this is the tower where the computer science used to be though,

66
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.580
when this was written, there wasn't a computer science department.

67
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.610
It was still taught in maths, Martin, what was your,

68
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.140
you haven't seen this for a while.

69
00:04:10.141 --> 00:04:14.190
I wanted to feel like seeing it pop up on the screen. Wonderful. I mean,

70
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.140
it's like going back to my youth nearly 30 years, Steve,

71
00:04:19.141 --> 00:04:21.600
more critical first impression.

72
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.580
<v 1>I think I was going back to my youth.</v>

73
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.940
It was being a school kid then sort of getting software like this to play.

74
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.000
I don't think I've ever used this when I was doing my chemistry level,

75
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.730
but I certainly saw things similar to this. So yeah.

76
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.330
Eight brought back moments for me as well.

77
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.270
<v 0>We have to press the, any key.</v>

78
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.970
So we have three games here, periodic table,

79
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.250
multiple choice and chemistry, Nottingham the information on the courses.

80
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.940
I don't think we need to look at the chemistry, knotting them at the moment.

81
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.660
No one. I want multiple choice.

82
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.230
Okay. Let's go.

83
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.180
Which should we try?

84
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.090
Perhaps we begin by displaying the full periodic table just to see what happens.

85
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.710
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

86
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.200
<v 0>So should we try seeing, yeah.</v>

87
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.330
<v 1>Let's have a look at Silicon.</v>

88
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.930
<v 0>Silicon locate course.</v>

89
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.890
And then, um, hit question Mark.

90
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.810
<v 2>Well.</v>

91
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.640
<v 0>It's quite tight, Nicole, isn't it.</v>

92
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.320
And that's gold.

93
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:50.880
I think, I think they've cheated.

94
00:05:50.881 --> 00:05:54.540
I think they've got the same thing for quite a few elements here.

95
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.060
Perhaps they were running out to storage.

96
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.460
I want to see what it says for France.

97
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.580
Doesn't have very much on front SIM, but it has.

98
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.560
<v 1>There's is a game where you get to fill in the blanks on the periodic table.</v>

99
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.210
That'd be number two. I think

100
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.420
so there's three user defined tables,

101
00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:21.850
but we've never randomly blank tables go on. For.

102
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:24.880
<v 0>What percentage do you think?</v>

103
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.200
<v 1>Well, I think we got too high.</v>

104
00:06:26.201 --> 00:06:29.950
It'll take forever to do this and the video will go on longer than Dave

105
00:06:29.951 --> 00:06:34.870
Brailsford. So let's go for about 5% or so six. Okay. We'll be adventurous.

106
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.790
6% is blank and 120 seconds that's given.

107
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.460
<v 0>Well, there's a blank in the first room if I can find the cursor.</v>

108
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.700
So that should be quite easy. That's carbon. Yep.

109
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.130
I knew that one. And then under

110
00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.730
10 is late and Timmy's bespoke good

111
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.960
routine in the Russian element. And then also,

112
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.720
and then this is

113
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:10.540
[inaudible]. I think that one's red, the full temp. Was it red before Tinder, 

114
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:10.540
but L w those Lorenz may have changed since then. What numbers, what numbers on

115
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:10.540
 starting and that's 99, isn't it? 19 930 seconds left. It's not Curium Sippel

116
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:10.540
we'll have happen. You got five out of seven and 111 seconds. You score 232 hits

117
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.373
space for the full team. This is the best part.

118
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.320
So I didn't, I didn't make it.

119
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.530
You're not in the periodicity hall of fame professor.

120
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:08.500
You want to end the period in city hall of fame.

121
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.900
I don't know the reason they've had this chance to play these games is because I

122
00:08:13.901 --> 00:08:18.580
was talking to Steve, who is a star of one of our other channels,

123
00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:23.410
computer file about computing. And he had the computer.

124
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.090
I had the desk and bingo, but he can't do the games.

125
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.590
And if you want to watch computer file, there'll be links on screen.

126
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:36.250
And there are links in the video description as well,

127
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.750
and their opportunities to try and play this game online as well.

128
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:41.613
If you really want.

129
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.340
<v 1>I then copied them via floppy disk onto my Mac,</v>

130
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.720
using the floppy drive over here can then

131
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.730
I can use a BBC emulator. How many can you run at the same time?

132
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.060
Um, quite a lot. In fact, though,
