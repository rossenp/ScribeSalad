00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.100
<v 0>So we've got something really exciting to tell you about a paper that came out</v>

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.940
during the lockdown. It's actually a physics paper,

3
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.150
but it's about a new form of nitrogen.

4
00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:16.620
The element nitrogen and people are already calling it black

5
00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:19.710
nitrogen. I'll explain why in a minute,

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.030
but before you get too excited about having your own

7
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:24.960
sample,

8
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.600
it can only be made at a pressure of 1.4 million

9
00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:31.920
atmospheres.

10
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.230
That's 1.4 million times higher pressure than

11
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.390
that atmospheric pressure and the surface and the temperature

12
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.070
a bit over 4,000 degrees Celsius, right?

13
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.570
So it's not an experiment you can do in your kitchen,

14
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.920
nitrogen.

15
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.410
And two exists as a gas at room temperature.

16
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.350
And if you cool it down, it forms a liquid.

17
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.390
And so chemists everywhere are only familiar with the gas or liquid

18
00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:14.720
nitrogen. If you only really cold,

19
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.730
you can also get to solid,

20
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.380
but most chemist have never seen solid nitrogen phosphorus.

21
00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:22.430
On the other hand,

22
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.930
which is in the same group of the periodic table immediately underneath

23
00:01:26.931 --> 00:01:31.640
nitrogen phosphorus has three different forms,

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.020
has a white form, which is rarely reactive.

25
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.270
You've seen Pete burning it.

26
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.980
<v 1>And then we'll watch what happens.</v>

27
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.170
So instantaneously, you can see that fantastic oxidation reaction.

28
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.850
<v 0>Red phosphorus,</v>

29
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.710
which is a sort of reddish Brown color and black phosphorus,

30
00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.050
which I'd never seen till a couple of years ago when I was giving a lecture in

31
00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:04.640
the German city often when I was a bit worried before the

32
00:02:04.641 --> 00:02:06.380
lecture and walking round,

33
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.030
I saw a case with a sample of black phosphorus,

34
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.370
and I photographed it for you, the periodic videos viewers,

35
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.440
and as the first time for me to show you and you can see it really is black.

36
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.780
Now in black phosphorus,

37
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.550
the atoms of phosphorus are arranged in rings.

38
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.500
Hexagonal rings that are joined together like the wire in

39
00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:38.180
chicken wire, but unlike chicken wire, they're not flat,

40
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.310
but they go up and down because of the angles between the

41
00:02:43.311 --> 00:02:47.780
bonds and the phosphorus nobody has ever before

42
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.140
seen nitrogen in this form.

43
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.010
So nobody has seen nitrogen with this structure

44
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.670
though, in theory, nitrogen could form that.

45
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.780
But usually the reason that I and everybody else teaches our

46
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:07.930
students is that end too,

47
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.880
has the strongest possible bond between two atoms or so-called triple

48
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:13.714
bond.

49
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.310
And any other form of nitrogen would decompose to form

50
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:21.790
into gas with a huge release of energy.

51
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.530
So you've already seen on some of our videos when reactions form and

52
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.140
two, they release a lot of energy,

53
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.380
our famous bulking dog experiment,

54
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.620
and rocket fuels. You've seen our rocket tension

55
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.840
And the decomposition of nitrogen triad date.

56
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.460
They all form nitrogen and release energy.

57
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.920
Now this experiment,

58
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.050
which was explained in the paper was performed in Germany

59
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.210
by a group,

60
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.680
led by a scientist called Dominique [inaudible]

61
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.680
. They have built a very special piece of operators that will generate really high pressures. And the operators consists of two pieces of diamond, which are tapered. So they go to a very narrow point. And the end of the point is flattened. When you press the fat ends of the diamonds, you amplify the pressure. So you can generate a really high pressure between the tips between the tips. They put a very thin sheet of the metal rhenium, and they drilled 

62
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.680
a tiny hole, only 40 microns thinner than when the may has in that

63
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.513
 toe is where they did the experiment. They have a machine for generating pressure. They fill it by putting a very high pressure of nitrogen round, the whole operators about 1200 atmospheres.

64
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.690
So quite high pressure of nitrogen.

65
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.070
And as they start squeezing the nitrogen solidifies,

66
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.240
and when it's solid, it is not very compressible.

67
00:05:12.241 --> 00:05:17.220
So they can ramp up the pressure very easily, that type, they get the pressure,

68
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.590
but how did they heat it?

69
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.600
And the way they heat it is to shine a laser beam,

70
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.850
a very intense laser beam through the diamond onto the

71
00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:30.684
sample.

72
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.510
And the laser beam can deliver a lot of energy very quickly and heat up the end

73
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.520
into before they have melted the whole of the operators, right?

74
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.380
And when they heat it up, the nitrogen bones get broken.

75
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.560
The atoms get really hot,

76
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.940
give out a lot of light because they're just so hot.

77
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.820
You'll know how red top things give out.

78
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.970
And this is much hotter than red hot. When the bones are broken,

79
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.210
they can reform in a different way. And how do they form?

80
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:09.920
What happens what's happened is that at a

81
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:13.580
pressure of about 1.2 million atmospheres,

82
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.830
the nitrogen is actually black. And this is the exciting thing.

83
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.090
When they heat it up at 1.4 million atmospheres,

84
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.940
it suddenly goes transparent.

85
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.580
So they have the sample of transparent nitrogen under

86
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:35.390
really high pressure. And the question is,

87
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.620
how do you find that what this transparent stuff is made of?

88
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.250
How are the nitrogen atoms arranged.

89
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.170
<v 2>After they've done the experiment and they've had the high pressure and the</v>

90
00:06:47.171 --> 00:06:49.570
laser, and everything's turned off,

91
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.360
does the nitrogen stay in its solid form.

92
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.130
<v 0>Once it's formed, at least for the time of the experiment,</v>

93
00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.290
everything is stable. How much.

94
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.040
<v 2>If they made like a thimble fall or like how much do you make in this little</v>

95
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.933
avoid?

96
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:09.100
<v 0>Well, you have a hole that is 40 microns in</v>

97
00:07:09.101 --> 00:07:10.120
diameter,

98
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.220
and the rhenium starts at 200

99
00:07:15.221 --> 00:07:18.160
microns thick and get squashed.

100
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.780
So there's really very, very little, you know,

101
00:07:22.781 --> 00:07:27.310
normally we talk about cubic centimeters or

102
00:07:27.311 --> 00:07:29.140
milliliters here.

103
00:07:29.141 --> 00:07:33.820
We're talking about the Pico liter or perhaps even less.

104
00:07:33.821 --> 00:07:37.660
So a tiny, tiny amount. So the question is,

105
00:07:37.661 --> 00:07:39.400
how do you find out what it is?

106
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:45.340
And they have two different ways of doing it the first way is that

107
00:07:45.341 --> 00:07:49.090
they've taken their operators to a so-called

108
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.350
synchrotron.

109
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:55.230
This is a very large piece of equipment and electronic

110
00:07:55.231 --> 00:07:56.260
accelerator,

111
00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.700
which produces very intense pulses of x-rays.

112
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.640
And you can use those x-rays to look at

113
00:08:06.641 --> 00:08:11.170
the structure of crystals and the

114
00:08:11.171 --> 00:08:15.430
tiny piece of nitrogen transparent nitrogen they've made

115
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.020
is the crystal. What happens when they shine?

116
00:08:20.021 --> 00:08:24.820
The x-rays onto the crystal is that the

117
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.690
x-rays are diffracted to a series of spots.

118
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:34.090
Rather light light is diffracted from the back of the CD or

119
00:08:34.091 --> 00:08:37.570
DVD from the pattern of these spots,

120
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.520
they can compute what the structure of the solid

121
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.530
was that different. Did the x-rays have they.

122
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.860
<v 2>Carried the crystal from where they did the experiment to the synchrotron,</v>

123
00:08:50.861 --> 00:08:54.850
or do they do the experiment at the synchrotron or is the crystal stable enough

124
00:08:54.851 --> 00:08:57.360
that you can put it in a container and carry it around.

125
00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.080
<v 0>The experiments done in the synchrotron?</v>

126
00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:02.930
And as far as I know,

127
00:09:02.931 --> 00:09:06.320
they take the diffraction pattern as quickly as they can,

128
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.150
after they've heated with the laser.

129
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:12.950
And there's some nice pictures that Dominique sent to us showing the

130
00:09:12.951 --> 00:09:16.370
equipment in situ at the synchrotron,

131
00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:21.410
it looks so complicated. I don't even quite know which way the beam goes,

132
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.790
but it's pretty impressive.

133
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:25.820
<v 2>And what did that synchrotron tell them what had they created?</v>

134
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:30.740
<v 0>What the synchrotron told them was that the</v>

135
00:09:30.741 --> 00:09:35.300
structure of the nitrogen they had formed was exactly the

136
00:09:35.301 --> 00:09:40.160
same structure as the structure of black phosphorous,

137
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.960
which is why they called them material B P

138
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:50.450
N BP for black phosphorus and then N for nitrogen.

139
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.820
<v 2>So there's no actual phosphorus in there.</v>

140
00:09:52.821 --> 00:09:55.820
The BP just stands for this is like black phosphorus.

141
00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.840
<v 0>Yes, precisely no phosphorus in it at all.</v>

142
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.610
It just has the same structure. Some journalists who've reported it,

143
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.570
simplified it and called it black nitrogen,

144
00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:14.360
which is a bit silly since it's transparent and the light can get through.

145
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:17.630
<v 2>It was black for awhile. And then it went transparent. What's that about.</v>

146
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:23.300
<v 0>The solid nitrogen from which it's formed is black</v>

147
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.810
because it has some other structure.

148
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:31.010
And I don't know precisely why it's black,

149
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:36.170
but the fact that the BP nitrogen is colorless is

150
00:10:36.171 --> 00:10:37.190
really interesting.

151
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:42.530
They believe the reason is the 10 black phosphorous,

152
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.300
which is really black,

153
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:49.070
the bonds between each phosphorous item of the same length,

154
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.000
but in the nitrogen form,

155
00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:57.980
some of the nitrogen atoms are closer together than other ones.

156
00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:02.780
And this means that the electrons in the black

157
00:11:02.781 --> 00:11:07.610
nitrogen is arranged in a different way from the electrons

158
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.600
in black phosphorous and for physicists. That's really very good.

159
00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.480
<v 2>So professor, I can see what the physicists are excited,</v>

160
00:11:14.481 --> 00:11:16.610
just because they've seen something for the first time,

161
00:11:16.611 --> 00:11:21.380
but is there any usefulness to this or applications like with graphene and

162
00:11:21.381 --> 00:11:22.214
things like that?

163
00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:26.510
<v 0>I think the answer is that there's no application for</v>

164
00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.320
black nitrogen as it is,

165
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:34.280
but it might have some use

166
00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:37.520
because in the sense,

167
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:41.990
the tip will allow people to understand the behavior of nitrogen

168
00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.980
and allow them to design new materials,

169
00:11:45.981 --> 00:11:50.930
which contain some nitrogen and perhaps some phosphorus or some other element

170
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.480
so that they get different electronic properties.

171
00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.930
But from the point of view of chemists,

172
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.280
I think it is very interesting because we,

173
00:12:03.281 --> 00:12:07.720
as chemists usually don't think very much about high

174
00:12:07.721 --> 00:12:10.540
pressures for us.

175
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:15.670
200 atmospheres is already a really high pressure.

176
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:20.860
And we never really think much about how our elements

177
00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.060
behave when there is a million atmosphere's pressure.

178
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:31.210
And so I think what this experiment will do

179
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:35.860
is make me be slightly less dogmatic when I say

180
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.710
nitrogen only exist as in too.

181
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.440
And for some of you who are away from school because of

182
00:12:44.441 --> 00:12:48.670
lockdown, when you go back, you can say to your teachers,

183
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.840
you're wrong. There isn't just, and two,

184
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:55.810
there's a new form that's been discovered.

185
00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:02.760
<v 1>Raising and liquid nitrogen. I'd never tried freezing a banana.</v>
