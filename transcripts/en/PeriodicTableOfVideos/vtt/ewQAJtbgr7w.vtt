00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.380
<v 0>The brigade, the rosier</v>

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.480
[inaudible] stupid nuts.

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.900
[inaudible] dear friends.

4
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.650
They've finally chosen the name for element 115.

5
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.970
And the name is Moscow Liam, or perhaps with a Russian accent.

6
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.170
Must scorpion.

7
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.400
The reason they have chosen a Russian name is because the element was

8
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:31.380
sensitized for the first time in [inaudible] somewhere to the North

9
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.250
of Moscow is the big research center where

10
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.350
elements synthesis has been studied for the last 30 or more

11
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:41.184
years.

12
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.050
Originally under the leadership of flurry of after whom

13
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.460
flerovium was named quite recently as were the other elements.

14
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.410
The way that you make these elements is by accelerating

15
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.660
very light iron it's very high speed into

16
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.400
a heavy element and the nuclei fuse together. Now,

17
00:01:05.401 --> 00:01:09.120
the problem is that both nuclear are positively charged.

18
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.010
So you need a lot of energy to overcome the repulsion positive against

19
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.400
positive, but then once it's made,

20
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.360
you didn't want too much energy, or it will immediately fall to bits.

21
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.770
It's a bit like trying to jump from the ground onto the top of a

22
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.680
flagpole. You might get there,

23
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.460
but then overbalance straight away and fall off again to do this.

24
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.690
It's not just enough to choose the right atomic numbers,

25
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.360
but you'll have to choose the right isotope.

26
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.860
That's the atoms with the correct number of protons and

27
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.390
neutrons. So that in combination you get to stable number,

28
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.340
it's really important to understand that calcium 48 is a

29
00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:56.370
very rare isotope of calcium,

30
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.240
less than 0.1% of naturally occurring calcium.

31
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.820
And it's very expensive to produce.

32
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.820
And there is only one plant in the whole of Russia,

33
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.010
one plant in the whole world that can make calcium 48.

34
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.780
They ionize the calcium atoms and then separate the magnetically

35
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.700
as in a mass spectrometer.

36
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.680
So you need huge amounts of electricity to produce a few

37
00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:27.300
milligrams of the compound. And apparently in one experiment in Duke,

38
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.040
now they use the million dollars worth of calcium 48.

39
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.350
In these experiments, you're bombarding.

40
00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:38.970
The tongue gets Emory SIM with trillions of calcium irons,

41
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.190
and only very rarely does the correct fusion take place.

42
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.240
And you make one of the nuclei of element 115.

43
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.930
Very fortunately, when you are successful,

44
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.100
the element comes out to the back, almost in the straight line,

45
00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.940
whereas when it blows up fragments in something else,

46
00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:03.070
the fragments go in all directions.

47
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.680
So if you put a very narrow slit behind your target,

48
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.570
you can get not just element 115,

49
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.260
but the subset of fragments that contains that,

50
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.420
and most of the junk goes away.

51
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.020
Muskogee Liam is in group 15.

52
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.640
That's the group that begins with nitrogen and then phosphorous.

53
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.750
And what is interesting about this group is that it includes arsenic,

54
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.310
which is very poisonous,

55
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.060
used to be used by poisoners to kill their wives or husbands.

56
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.130
But now as you go down the CR you come to bismuth the element immediately

57
00:03:41.131 --> 00:03:46.020
above Muskogee and bismuth is surprisingly and poisonous it's even

58
00:03:46.021 --> 00:03:49.710
used in medicines. So it's a very interesting question.

59
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.130
If you had a large quantity of Muskogee, Liam,

60
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.530
would it be poisonous or not?

61
00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.240
It's also interesting to think whether the chemistry

62
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.340
would be similar to that,

63
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.270
to phosphorus arsenic and bismuth or whether like bismuth,

64
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.080
it would be almost like a metal you can get, for example,

65
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.850
phosphorous Penta, fluoride, PFI, five arsenic, Penta, fluoride,

66
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.620
but you don't get these Penta fluorides of business,

67
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.450
or at least you don't get them so easily.

68
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.140
So there'd be a lot of interesting chemistry, but unfortunately,

69
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.000
the technology so far will not allow you to do that sort of chemistry.

70
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.000
Moscow is one of my favorite cities.

71
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.700
And so obviously I'm delighted.

72
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.440
Muscovy is one of the few elements named after capital city.

73
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.790
And most of the others are not easily recognizable because for example,

74
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.400
lutetium is named after Paris, but it's a Latin name that unless, you know,

75
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.770
doesn't seem to relate to Paris at all. So I think it's a very good name,

76
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.690
as I mentioned before,

77
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.760
Scottish viewers will like it because it has a symbol MC and many

78
00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:05.790
Scottish surnames begin with MC.

79
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.410
So they're going to be a lot of people in Scotland who can now spell their name

80
00:05:10.411 --> 00:05:12.480
with the elements of the periodic table.

81
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.400
Making Muskogee him has been a fantastic piece of international collaboration

82
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.280
because although the experiments were done in Russia,

83
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.810
they re lied on having samples of Amaris Siham,

84
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.610
which were made in America.

85
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.960
These are very specialist experiments where you need a

86
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.310
particular facility that can make the act you want.

87
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.350
We're talking about the starting material of milligrams

88
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.430
or less. So even if the process was very efficient,

89
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.890
you would only get milligrams of the element.

90
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.790
And because of the low probability, forming them

91
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.220
about really quite small numbers of atoms being formed.

92
00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.350
And in this paper, which is about the sensitive,

93
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:05.390
the heavy elements they're giving the numbers of the atoms of these different

94
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:09.710
elements, 118 hundred and 17, so on. So for 115,

95
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.120
the highest number that any lab has seen that's in Dubliner is

96
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.030
27 atoms of a particular isotope.

97
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.540
Just to make that clear in my teacup,

98
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.190
there are probably 10 to the 26 or 10 to the

99
00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:27.020
27 atoms.

100
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:32.180
It is really almost incalculable that you can start costing up this

101
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:35.570
element atom by atom and each atom.

102
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.950
Probably if you take in all the costs will cost millions of dollars.

103
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.510
Whereas with gold, for millions of dollars, you can get several kilos,

104
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.640
but for here,

105
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.630
you got one atom and it doesn't last very long.

106
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.920
So it's the ultimate gift to give to somebody.

107
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.870
You might just have enough time to say, I love you before the atom decays.

108
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.600
<v 1>It's the million dollar items. Yes.</v>

109
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.250
We already have an element named after Doug ner Doug medium. Is it overkill?

110
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.070
You know, now having Moscow them, are they, are they hugging all the names?

111
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.960
<v 0>I think it's fair enough.</v>

112
00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.400
You have to bear in mind that there are some places that have at least four

113
00:07:15.401 --> 00:07:16.750
elements named after them,

114
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.890
particularly it had been the small islands near Stockholm

115
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.510
and there's California.

116
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:28.480
Berkelium Le ransom and live a Moriam are all in

117
00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:32.470
California. So I don't think it's unreasonable

118
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.650
in my pockets.

119
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:41.380
I've got this and this is a real Nobel prize

120
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.530
metal. It's a real Nobel prize metal made of gold.

121
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.950
It's the metal that was won by my colleague at the Royal society to pull nurse

122
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.800
the precedent. And I borrowed it for this lecture.
