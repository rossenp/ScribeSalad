1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.950
<v 0>This is Nobel prize in chemistry has as usual been given to three</v>

2
00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:05.784
people,

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.290
but one person has won half the Nobel prize.

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.120
And the other two show the other half the Nobel prize is

5
00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:19.530
based upon the idea of exploiting evolution

6
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.120
in bacteria,

7
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.220
in other biological systems to make chemicals,

8
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.840
to make pharmaceuticals. That would be very difficult to make. In other ways.

9
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.240
<v 1>Half of it went to this fantastic researcher called Francis Arnold she's in</v>

10
00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:36.500
Caltech in California,

11
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.660
and has been a major success for the community of

12
00:00:41.661 --> 00:00:43.100
enzymology and Talia.

13
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.900
<v 0>The other half was split between, uh, George Smith. And so Gregory winter,</v>

14
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.900
they were awarded the prize for the development of a technique called phage

15
00:00:50.901 --> 00:00:51.734
display.

16
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.480
I only know really something about one half of the Nobel prize.

17
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.290
That's the one, one by Francis Arnold.

18
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.630
<v 1>Her main thing is the, um,</v>

19
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.490
development of techniques that have been applied to enzymes to change their

20
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.100
capacity properties and the quality.

21
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.420
<v 0>To find ways of changing enzymes,</v>

22
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.790
the natural catalysts that catalyze most of the

23
00:01:19.791 --> 00:01:24.530
processes in our bodies and in all living organisms,

24
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.390
how to change those enzymes so that they will do chemical

25
00:01:29.391 --> 00:01:33.380
reactions that we would really like to be done. For example,

26
00:01:33.381 --> 00:01:37.850
for making biofuels, for making other chemicals that we need.

27
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.410
<v 1>And then she has screening methods to see which of the Newtons that she's</v>

28
00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:46.090
generated will survive the new condition that she's put in the enzyme.

29
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.570
<v 0>They take DNA in a gene,</v>

30
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.400
which makes an enzyme that sort of does the reaction you want

31
00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.440
and randomly mutate the DNA so that it makes

32
00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:03.470
changes and makes a slightly different enzyme.

33
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.790
So you get lots and lots of different enzymes from one set of

34
00:02:07.791 --> 00:02:08.870
mutations,

35
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.060
and then you try all of those enzymes for the

36
00:02:14.061 --> 00:02:15.290
reaction you want.

37
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.130
<v 1>Her major expertise is with this enzyme called cytochrome P four 50.</v>

38
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.290
An oxidative type of enzyme is a hymn based enzyme that she can manipulate

39
00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:28.100
with an ease and an elegance that is, uh, Israeli.

40
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.710
<v 0>And you select the enzyme or few enzymes that do the reaction a</v>

41
00:02:33.711 --> 00:02:35.630
bit better than the natural one.

42
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.500
<v 1>Chicken grow them in the lab. She can manipulate the DNA very efficiently,</v>

43
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.710
and then she screens for variants that she, um,

44
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.850
is interested in because they're doing the reaction that she's.

45
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.890
<v 0>And then you go round and round and round each time to choose the</v>

46
00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:56.240
best enzymes that you produce. And after a few generations,

47
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.270
you can produce an enzyme that the reaction you want very,

48
00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:02.380
very much better.

49
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.690
<v 2>Chemists with all these amazing machinery and labs and all these things you do.</v>

50
00:03:06.691 --> 00:03:08.040
And yet it seems like in the end,

51
00:03:08.041 --> 00:03:12.150
a lot of the time you just use nature to do what you want to do like this nature

52
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.050
still the best at it.

53
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.550
<v 1>Absolutely. That's exactly.</v>

54
00:03:14.551 --> 00:03:17.820
Actually one of Frances definition that is nature is the best chemist.

55
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.560
<v 0>The point is that bacteria can make these enzymes very easily.</v>

56
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.320
That generations rotate very quickly.

57
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.570
And once you've got the enzyme identified the modified one that

58
00:03:30.571 --> 00:03:34.350
can do it, it is then very easy to produce it in large amounts.

59
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.390
<v 1>Well, certainly I thought that she would have,</v>

60
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.920
she was very close to getting the Nobel prize because of all this innovation.

61
00:03:40.921 --> 00:03:44.550
She's also an excellent person like her. She's a lovely person.

62
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.510
She has quite a nice, quite has evolved quite vigorously.

63
00:03:48.511 --> 00:03:52.140
I would say in her career, she's a woman and she's an engineer.

64
00:03:52.141 --> 00:03:56.100
And I think she was the first professor in engineering in college.

65
00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.350
<v 0>And she's a really impressive example of somebody who is both a scientist and</v>

66
00:04:01.351 --> 00:04:06.000
engineer who is combining engineering principles

67
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.590
and scientific principles to do something that's never been done before.

68
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.770
<v 1>Fewer females in science. Unfortunately,</v>

69
00:04:13.771 --> 00:04:17.130
this is something we are really trying to change. Um,

70
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.660
and the community is becoming very attentive to this situation as well.

71
00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:24.450
So the fact that she was a woman was amazing,

72
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.330
but the fact that she was a woman in my field of research,

73
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.020
that was really what made before me, you know, so it was a great recognition,

74
00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:33.360
a great boost to the field. And, um,

75
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.020
maybe also sparking attention from other scientists in, uh,

76
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.280
peripheral fields to enzyme engineering that I now become interested. So yes,

77
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.050
being a female was amazing. And then it combined that on with that research

78
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.413
can be any better.

79
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.980
<v 0>She's the only the fifth woman to ever to win the Nobel prize in</v>

80
00:04:52.981 --> 00:04:53.814
chemistry.

81
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.950
And I'm pleased to say that two of those women have won the Nobel prize

82
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.040
during the time we've been making periodic videos.

83
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.070
<v 2>How did you find out that she'd won the Nobel prize? Where were you,</v>

84
00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:05.904
what were you doing?

85
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.860
<v 1>I was doing a PhD vibe and I got a text message</v>

86
00:05:10.861 --> 00:05:15.000
from one of my former PhD students and said, you know, fast as Adam did it.

87
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.680
And I was in the Vive.

88
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.070
I couldn't really do anything other than checking it on my unit. I watch.

89
00:05:20.071 --> 00:05:23.400
And I was like, God, I really need to check this out.

90
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.370
And I had to finish until know, wait until the end of the Bible.

91
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.000
<v 0>They exploited a virus. I've got a model here. My, my empty bottle,</v>

92
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.760
I'm a pipe cleaner. So they, they, um,

93
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.370
exploited a virus called a bacteria phage.

94
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.400
And it's a very simple biological structure.

95
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.170
And it's composed of protein coat, which is represented by the bottle, uh,

96
00:05:46.171 --> 00:05:49.410
which has many different proteins that are assembled together into this.

97
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.370
What's called a capsid internal to this capsid is, um, Australian of DNA.

98
00:05:53.371 --> 00:05:58.070
So genetic material that, um, codes for the proteins of.

99
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.230
<v 3>The coat, it has the ability to,</v>

100
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.840
and the information encoded within it to replicate itself.

101
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.680
But it can't do that on its own. It has to ha has to do this with bacteria.

102
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.810
And so the bacteria phage can infect bacteria with its DNA

103
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.110
and the bacteria is forced to use its cellular machinery to,

104
00:06:16.111 --> 00:06:20.150
to read and decode the DNA and produce all of the proteins that are involved in

105
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.280
the, in the coat. And so within the bacteria,

106
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.850
the protein coat forms around the file DNA,

107
00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:30.590
and then the bacteria face break out of the bacteria and then can scuttle off

108
00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:33.470
and, and then infect more bacteria. And that's their life cycle.

109
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:34.970
That's all it does. It goes,

110
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.830
it goes into the bacteria and then the bacteria doesn't just make one copy of

111
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.720
the, of the capsule. It just keeps going.

112
00:06:41.721 --> 00:06:45.620
It keeps making them until they burst out. So from, I don't know how many, uh,

113
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.430
bacteria phase you're made from, from one piece of DNA, but it's it's many.

114
00:06:49.431 --> 00:06:53.950
So it, all it does is reproduce and then kill the backup. That's his job.

115
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.010
It doesn't seem like a nice dude. No, it's not.

116
00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.540
Forest is not particularly friendly. So George Smith, one of the recipients.

117
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.760
So he was the first to exploit the,

118
00:07:03.761 --> 00:07:06.250
the relationship between the bacteria phage and the bacteria.

119
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:11.320
And so he forced the bacteria to make a bacteria phage, which, which had,

120
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.970
um, a protein of interest,

121
00:07:12.971 --> 00:07:17.710
a different protein attached to the top of the protein coat to the capsule.

122
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.710
So I've got my little, my little bespoke protein here.

123
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.290
He did this by inserting a gene.

124
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.140
So the DNA codes for the specific protein.

125
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.290
And so when the bacteria read and decode this DNA,

126
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.610
they'll produce all of the proteins that make up the capsid,

127
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:38.300
but the heal they'll also produce, uh, this new bespoke protein. Uh,

128
00:07:38.301 --> 00:07:43.090
and so the gene for this protein is inserted into another gene within

129
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.530
the viral DNA.

130
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:49.260
So he's produced a bacteria phase that displays this bespoke, uh,

131
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.133
protein at the top.

132
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:54.490
He was forcing the bacteria to express bacteria phage with small fragments of

133
00:07:54.491 --> 00:07:57.280
proteins at the top. And these fragments are antigenic,

134
00:07:57.281 --> 00:08:00.310
which means they can be recognized by the immune system.

135
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.650
And so if we have an infection,

136
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.580
we can an immune response in our body and the body produces larger proteins

137
00:08:06.581 --> 00:08:07.960
called antibodies.

138
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:12.370
And these can be engineered by our body to bind to pretty much any protein

139
00:08:12.371 --> 00:08:16.540
sequence. And so these little fragments can be recognized by antibodies.

140
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:20.890
And so you can use the structure now, so he can take a known antibody,

141
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:25.510
which will bind to this peptide and he can then fish this whole bacteria Faraj,

142
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.220
but here phase out of solution.

143
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:31.990
The reason for this is that what makes this a fantastic technique is he's now

144
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:36.160
plucked out, uh, the peptide that binds to the antibody,

145
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.330
but he also has importantly the genetic information that codes for this peptide.

146
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:45.310
So he can then see what peptide is produce, what protein is produced, um,

147
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:49.810
from a certain gene and also which peptide or protein binds to the

148
00:08:49.811 --> 00:08:51.010
antibody. And in fact,

149
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:55.120
the weather sort of healthcare aspect really comes in is with a sir Gregory

150
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.130
winter who took this technology further. And so we just talked about antibodies.

151
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.310
He inserted genes, that code for antibodies into the,

152
00:09:03.311 --> 00:09:05.400
the phage DNA. And so he,

153
00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:09.540
the bacteria would produce the bacteria phage with antibodies attached to the

154
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:13.220
surface attached to the capsid. Okay. So once you formed your,

155
00:09:13.221 --> 00:09:16.290
your bacteria phage with your antibody there, that's fantastic that you can,

156
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.190
you can produce that.

157
00:09:17.191 --> 00:09:21.600
But th one of the really genius aspects of this research is the ability to

158
00:09:21.601 --> 00:09:26.420
produce billions of different antibodies on top of these phages. And,

159
00:09:26.421 --> 00:09:31.380
and this is done by, uh, making small mutations of the gene,

160
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:35.220
that codes for the antibody that's been inserted into the bacteria phage.

161
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.890
And so this is actually quite easily done.

162
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:42.090
And so a gene is a small section of DNA, which has made up as a polymer,

163
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:44.640
which has made up of many subunits called nucleotides.

164
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.990
And so you may have a few thousand or many thousand nucleotides in one gene.

165
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:53.520
And so the sequence of nucleotides is very specific and it codes for a very

166
00:09:53.521 --> 00:09:58.140
specific protein. And so just by making very small changes in the sequence,

167
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:59.550
you're mutating that sequence.

168
00:09:59.551 --> 00:10:03.570
And then you make very small changes in the protein that it codes for.

169
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:05.520
Okay, so you can make all of these,

170
00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:08.400
you can be taped the DNA and in one pot have many,

171
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.610
many billions of different mutated sequences,

172
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:15.360
because there are so many nucleotides by making small changes. So for instance,

173
00:10:15.361 --> 00:10:16.860
you could, you could, um,

174
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.830
develop an antibody that binds to a specific target protein.

175
00:10:19.831 --> 00:10:22.860
So let's say if you had a protein that was on the surface of a cancer cell,

176
00:10:22.861 --> 00:10:26.520
that you wanted to bind an antibody to, um, what, uh,

177
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:30.990
Greg winter did was immobilize that target protein on a solid

178
00:10:30.991 --> 00:10:33.120
surface. So what you can do is you can, uh,

179
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:37.340
wash all of the many billions of fish with the different antibodies, uh,

180
00:10:37.341 --> 00:10:38.100
across the,

181
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.400
the solid support or they'll bind to the target protein and there'll be

182
00:10:41.401 --> 00:10:44.880
retained. And all the other, um, bacteria fiber will be washed away.

183
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.670
And then you can isolate the ones that bind,

184
00:10:47.671 --> 00:10:51.390
and you don't need to analyze the protein material because you have the genetic

185
00:10:51.391 --> 00:10:53.760
instructions already within the capsid.

186
00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:58.260
So you can take that DNA and you can, um, you can produce, uh,

187
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:01.410
many more of this particular phage. And then if you repeat the process,

188
00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:02.400
a number of times,

189
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:06.690
what you're left with is only the few antibodies that bind incredibly strong

190
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.360
that have a very high affinity with the target protein.

191
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:13.650
And these are the proteins that make the best, the most effective drugs.

192
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.530
Hi, thanks for watching. We've done lots of other videos about Nobel prizes,

193
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.800
previous winners, or just interesting stuff about the prize in general,

194
00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:24.320
if you'd like to check out a playlist of videos,

195
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:26.540
there should be a link on the screen right now,

196
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.820
or have a quick look down in the video description.
