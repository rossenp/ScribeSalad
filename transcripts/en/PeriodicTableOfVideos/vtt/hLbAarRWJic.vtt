00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.290
<v 0>If you can look,</v>

2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.460
I'm surrounded by books made out of paper and

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.590
the atmosphere in the room is 20% oxygen.

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.450
So have you ever wondered why the paper

5
00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:18.450
doesn't spontaneously stop burning

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.870
that matter? Why doesn't I have stopped burning or even me?

7
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.650
And the answer is a really important concept in chemistry called

8
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.480
activation energy.

9
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.280
You probably know that when something burns, it gives that heat,

10
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.500
the molecules start at a higher energy than they end up afterwards.

11
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.150
So the difference between these two Heights is the energy

12
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.720
releases. In order to release that energy,

13
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.010
you have to put in a bit of energy first to get the reaction going.

14
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.020
And that energy is called activation energy.

15
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.060
It's a bit like having to buy a lottery ticket before you can win a lump

16
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.903
sum of money.

17
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.160
But the difference is if you put in activation energy,

18
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.070
you definitely will get the energy out.

19
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.570
Whereas if you buy a lottery ticket, you may not win.

20
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.100
The reason why in the case of oxygen

21
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.530
that you have the activation energy or part of the reason is

22
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:32.670
because oxygen has unpaired electrons.

23
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.740
You can see our video that shows that oxygen is magnetic.

24
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.610
And if I take the liquid oxygen, you can say,

25
00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:46.590
I can pull it right up here and you have to pair these electrons up

26
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.710
to get the reaction going. Now,

27
00:01:49.711 --> 00:01:52.740
once you've got a little bit of the reaction going,

28
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.010
he took your paper with a match.

29
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.690
Then the heat that is given out will make the reaction

30
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.500
self-sustaining and it will in fact go faster and faster.

31
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.050
And you can put the activation energy in different ways,

32
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.630
either by heating things, you can do it with mechanical energy.

33
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.610
You can hit the chemical mixture with a hammer.

34
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.010
For example, when firing a gun,

35
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.410
the hammer hits the cartridge and sets it off.

36
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.840
Or if you strike a match,

37
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.910
the friction on the side of the matchbox

38
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.050
produces enough heat to get the reaction started.

39
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.020
You can also put in the energy with light.

40
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.570
<v 1>And there is a very famous.</v>

41
00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.120
<v 0>Reaction where you react hydrogen and chlorine</v>

42
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.570
and set it off with a flash of light,

43
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.560
Right breaks,

44
00:03:10.561 --> 00:03:15.060
the bonds between the two chlorine atoms and the

45
00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:16.710
cl two molecules.

46
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.230
And those CLL Latins react with the hydrogen produce

47
00:03:22.231 --> 00:03:26.400
heat, which then makes the reaction go off.

48
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.810
So once you've started it just like lighting with the match,

49
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.160
it goes to completion in that case with a really quite

50
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.570
spectacular bang.

51
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.380
When you have any collection of molecules,

52
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.490
some of the molecules have more energy than others,

53
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.590
and a very tiny number have a lot of energy.

54
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.910
So when you put in heat,

55
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.920
you increase the number of molecules that have a really lot of energy,

56
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.490
and then they have enough energy to react.

57
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.930
So quite a small amount of heat

58
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.310
can have a surprising effect on the rate of the reaction.

59
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.610
<v 1>Why does it need that heat for the reactions to happen in the first place?</v>

60
00:04:17.611 --> 00:04:19.350
Like why, why wasn't it already right.

61
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:20.280
<v 0>Reacting?</v>

62
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.110
Because there were not enough molecules that had the energy to

63
00:04:25.111 --> 00:04:30.030
make the reaction to go fast enough for you to realize these

64
00:04:30.031 --> 00:04:33.450
books are reacting with oxygen.

65
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.160
But so slowly that even though some of them are more than a

66
00:04:38.161 --> 00:04:41.550
hundred years old, essentially,

67
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.380
very few of them have reacted.

68
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.360
<v 1>Some of those books are on fire. They're just on fire. Very, very, very, very,</v>

69
00:04:48.361 --> 00:04:49.320
very, very gently.

70
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.320
<v 0>They oxidizing very slowly. I suppose.</v>

71
00:04:52.321 --> 00:04:56.760
Quite a good example is if you eat a chili baby,

72
00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.200
or sometimes I think in American,

73
00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:05.100
they call gummy bears. If you eat one of those,

74
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.850
you eventually convert it to carbon dioxide and water,

75
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.630
but flames don't come out of your mouth.

76
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.850
But if you rate them high temperature like Simon,

77
00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:19.890
Neil did on one of our videos.

78
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.110
<v 1>Oh wow, that's it.</v>

79
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.980
<v 0>You get huge flames because the reaction is going very fast.</v>

80
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.140
<v 1>And we should be able to fit not one, not two but four jelly babies,</v>

81
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.810
a chorus of jelly babies into this one.

82
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:45.563
[inaudible].

83
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.240
<v 0>This brings us on to catalysts.</v>

84
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.390
And the major role of a catalyst is to reduce

85
00:05:54.391 --> 00:05:59.270
the activation energy so that you don't have to put so

86
00:05:59.271 --> 00:06:03.230
much energy in to make the reaction go.

87
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.830
And very often these catalysts can be metals.

88
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.960
For example, platinum,

89
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.720
and the platinum will absorb molecules on the

90
00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:22.550
surface and for possibly make the

91
00:06:22.551 --> 00:06:25.610
bonds between the atoms break on the surface,

92
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.670
and then they can start reacting.

93
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.800
And when Brady and I went to the platinum refinery,

94
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.020
we saw large sheets of woven platinum wire that

95
00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:43.910
were used for the reaction between oxygen and ammonia to make nitric

96
00:06:43.911 --> 00:06:48.800
acid. And you can see it's got really quite a nice herringbone pattern,

97
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.490
rather nicely than my suits. You would make a nice suit.

98
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.590
And these big sheets of platinum could be used on an

99
00:06:57.591 --> 00:07:02.150
industrial scale to lower the activation energy for this reaction.

100
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.040
The whole point of a catalyst is that it can take

101
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.810
parts in the reaction, but it ends up in the same state it started.

102
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.500
So it can catalyze the next molecule reacting.

103
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.920
<v 2>You mentioned before that platinum was forming an actual break of bonds.</v>

104
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.120
Is the platinum involved in that chemical reaction or is it just its presence

105
00:07:25.121 --> 00:07:26.320
making those bonds break?

106
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:27.303
<v 0>Well,</v>

107
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:31.900
if you think about it in the bulk of the

108
00:07:31.901 --> 00:07:34.330
platinum metal, the,

109
00:07:34.331 --> 00:07:38.140
you can imagine the platinum atoms bonded together.

110
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.510
And those on the surface don't have

111
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:49.120
neighbors because they're at the edge. So they have,

112
00:07:49.121 --> 00:07:53.710
if you'd like dangling bonds, which the oxygen can bind onto.

113
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:58.270
So there is a transient reaction, a short live reaction,

114
00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.500
but at the end,

115
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:04.420
the oxygen leaves leaving a space for the next oxygen atom to come

116
00:08:04.421 --> 00:08:07.450
in or oxygen molecules come in.

117
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.930
<v 2>Are there reactions where the activation energy is so high,</v>

118
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:14.980
that the reaction only happens while you're pouring in activation energy?

119
00:08:14.981 --> 00:08:18.520
And once you remove the activation energy, it can't be self-sustaining.

120
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.800
<v 0>Well, this applies to what is called endothermic reactions.</v>

121
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.600
These are reactions,

122
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:30.250
which rather than releasing energy require energy,

123
00:08:30.251 --> 00:08:31.660
the energy of the product.

124
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.730
So it's higher than the energy of the starting material. And in that case,

125
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:41.020
you have to keep on pouring in energy to make the reaction go.

126
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.680
Most reactions tend to be exothermic.

127
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:49.600
<v 2>Exothermic reactions, where the it's so close to zero,</v>

128
00:08:49.601 --> 00:08:53.200
it's only just tipped over into exothermic that you have to keep pouring in

129
00:08:53.201 --> 00:08:56.010
energy. Anyway, yes, their reactions.

130
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.870
<v 0>That go from very endothermic to very exothermic.</v>

131
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.830
And there are quite a few that don't give out very much energy at all.

132
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:09.030
The reactions of manual Ganek compounds are not very

133
00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:13.950
exothermic. They have, um, an activation energy,

134
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:17.580
which means that around room temperature,

135
00:09:17.581 --> 00:09:21.270
if you increase the temperature by 10 degrees Celsius,

136
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:25.410
the rate of the reaction, approximately doubles.

137
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.790
So if you heat it up by 30 degrees,

138
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:34.560
the reaction will go eight times as fast it's as if you like the

139
00:09:34.561 --> 00:09:39.150
fact that organic compounds do not have very exothermic

140
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:40.770
reactions. Except of course,

141
00:09:40.771 --> 00:09:45.690
if they burn that allows you to build up very complicated,

142
00:09:45.691 --> 00:09:47.130
organic molecules,

143
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.440
inorganic molecules tend to have much more exothermic

144
00:09:52.441 --> 00:09:53.310
reactions.

145
00:09:53.311 --> 00:09:57.600
So they release their energy and one great foot and they've

146
00:09:57.601 --> 00:10:02.580
exploded or burns or whatever. Do you prefer exothermic or thermic?

147
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.020
Well, if you want to do a good demonstration,

148
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.620
that makes our YouTube viewers say, wow,

149
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:14.460
there's nothing to be too good. Exothermic reaction.

150
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:25.700
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>
