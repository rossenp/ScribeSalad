00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.830
<v 0>Brady. And I have just been looking at some photos from the 1930s</v>

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.690
archive of Nottingham.

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.770
These are labs that were the real state of the art.

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.180
The building had just been built as far as I knew that these photos here

5
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.310
of research students,

6
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.050
we knew that at least one of them called Wagstaff who's here subsequently

7
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.620
10 years later died in the second world war.

8
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.630
He was on a bomber which disappeared and never returned behind these

9
00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:34.710
photos. There are very real personal stories.

10
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.300
There are some quite strange things. People smoking pipes,

11
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.630
some of you might not even know what a pipe is.

12
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.370
Wooden thing for smoking tobacco. They're not wearing safety glasses,

13
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.350
the loads of chemicals everywhere. It's pretty untidy.

14
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.540
They know women, I suppose.

15
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:58.920
That's not so surprising because even when I was a student,

16
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.810
there weren't many women chemists.

17
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.820
These labs were brand new when the photo had been taken.

18
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.590
And we're in a really lucky position that I can show you some

19
00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:15.180
labs that are also brand new. They were opened two weeks ago.

20
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.340
So let's go upstairs and see what differences we can spot.

21
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.280
Before we go up. I should show you my tie,

22
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.900
special tie with test tubes and things on it. What's really special.

23
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.010
Is that here,

24
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.660
Tim gamble set it on fire with white phosphorus in the middle of a lecture.

25
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.010
Before we go, let me stress. This is a teaching lab.

26
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.170
It's for science, technology, engineering and maths. They,

27
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.140
what the mathematicians will do in this lab. I'm not sure.

28
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.240
So the first thing you noticed, everything's weight,

29
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.940
the benches await the lab coats await.

30
00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.370
Whereas you can see in the photo that the benches are dark and I think they

31
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.010
don't lab coats are a darkish color.

32
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.080
The next thing you've noticed is it's enormous compared

33
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.610
to this lab in the photo, there are many more students.

34
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.380
This is partly because there are many more students in universities than they

35
00:02:18.381 --> 00:02:23.000
were in the 1930s. There are lots more fume cupboards in the photo.

36
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.710
There's perhaps one. And you can see here that fume cup is everywhere.

37
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.530
The other thing that's really funny is that some of the film

38
00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:38.420
cupboards have transparent backs. So if we go round here,

39
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.380
you can see the students working away

40
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.340
without even needing to wear safety glasses.

41
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.250
And at the same time

42
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.400
we frightened them away.

43
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.000
It's good for them because if I want to demonstrate something,

44
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.670
they can stand around this side and watch what I'm doing great is really excited

45
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.830
because he can imagine videoing Neil from a completely different

46
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:09.664
angle,

47
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.930
seeing what he's really thinking when he doesn't speak.

48
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.760
So we can walk along this corridor to get to the middle

49
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:23.680
part of the lab. And again, you'll see the quite big differences.

50
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.480
One of the things you'll see immediately is that the people who teaching,

51
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.700
wearing colored lab coats like me so that the students can immediately

52
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:36.970
see who can help them. We have red coats,

53
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.980
our inorganic chemists,

54
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.420
and the green ones over there are the organic chemists.

55
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.000
So that's also an innovation mixing up organic chemists and then

56
00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:50.680
organic chemists together.

57
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.040
It makes the lab much more flexible.

58
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.460
It means you don't need to have all the equipment duplicated.

59
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.630
One of the things that hasn't changed very much from this photo is the sink.

60
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.210
You can see here. There's still a sink with relatively seamless taps.

61
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.340
But the difference is that the sink is now made that a plastic rather

62
00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:17.620
than porcelain or China,

63
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.240
so that if you drop some glassware in there, it doesn't break.

64
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.750
You see? So you don't have to pay for it.

65
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.770
But students nowadays don't have to pay for their glassware. Anyway,

66
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:32.551
in the old days,

67
00:04:32.551 --> 00:04:36.390
some students had to finish their course early because they couldn't pay for the

68
00:04:36.391 --> 00:04:37.860
glassware that they were breaking.

69
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.413
<v 1>Dreadful.</v>

70
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.670
<v 0>There's one difference from really quite recent labs.</v>

71
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.880
There are lots and lots of fire extinguishers.

72
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.710
When I was teaching in the lab on the floor below a student,

73
00:04:52.711 --> 00:04:54.360
set fire to the bench,

74
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.770
and it took me a long time to find the fire extinguisher.

75
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.370
And by then the bench was really blazing away.

76
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.020
And once we put it out for years, I saw this child Mark.

77
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.700
Every time I went into the lab,

78
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.840
the most exciting thing about this lab is something which you might not have

79
00:05:15.841 --> 00:05:18.480
noticed. This bench here,

80
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.400
which has taps is fixed just like the benches in the old

81
00:05:23.401 --> 00:05:24.120
labs,

82
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.500
which we'll fix down and had to stay there for years and years and years.

83
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.120
But all the other benches that you can see in both

84
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.860
directions are on wheels. And so if we suddenly decide,

85
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.960
we'd like to change the way we teach this particular class in an

86
00:05:42.961 --> 00:05:46.860
afternoon, we can completely change the configuration of the lab,

87
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.490
move the benches around, move the electrical power around.

88
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.230
And so on the key to the flexibility are these sort of the

89
00:05:55.231 --> 00:05:56.340
elephant trunks,

90
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.430
because what these are doing are they contain the electrical power to the

91
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:03.890
benches, the internet connections.

92
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.700
And of course the pipes for the pipe,

93
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.570
nitrogen and compressed air that you have on the benches

94
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:13.940
and the water.

95
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.070
Apart from the basins where you wash your hands and some glass where all

96
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:21.200
the water is in the fume cupboards.

97
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.560
I haven't mentioned gas. We all think of Bunsen burners in labs.

98
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.540
There's no guests in this lab. So how do they heat things up?

99
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.290
The answer is with a guest like this,

100
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.150
I had to be taught how to use it a few minutes ago, you clip it down.

101
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.123
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

102
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.700
<v 0>And the flavor comes out the door of the few.</v>

103
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.530
It is automated, like Lyft, you press the button.

104
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:04.210
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

105
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.770
<v 0>One of the things that I thought was interesting is that when a bubble catches</v>

106
00:07:08.771 --> 00:07:13.360
fire, the burning gas continues to move up

107
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:15.880
almost the same shape as the bubble.
