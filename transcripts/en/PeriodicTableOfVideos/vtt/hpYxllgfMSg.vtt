00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.010
<v 0>France is the heaviest of the alkaline metals,</v>

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.420
at least until element 119 is synthesized.

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.520
It also has the biggest datum of any element in the whole

4
00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:18.150
periodic table. Now some of you may have seen on YouTube,

5
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.740
there are videos that pretend to be huge explosions of

6
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:23.574
Francine,

7
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.050
and I'm never quite sure whether I should be really pleased about this because

8
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:31.440
it shows that people are using the periodic table in the right way.

9
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.570
And deducing that France seems should be really very reactive or whether

10
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:40.890
I should be tearing out my hair because the videos are

11
00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:44.010
fake and they're chemically wrong.

12
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.100
But most of all, they miss the really exciting part about him,

13
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.600
which is the really moving story about Margaret Perry,

14
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.430
the woman who discovered France him at the beginning of the

15
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.900
20th century, it was obvious that they ought to be an element,

16
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.750
but the bottom of the alkaline metals.

17
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.640
And so lots of people were looking for it. The American professor,

18
00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:13.980
Fred Alison in Alabama,

19
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.080
the one who thought he discovered element 85 also thought that he

20
00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:21.360
discovered element 87,

21
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.260
but it turned out that his method that he was using,

22
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.850
which is quite complicated.

23
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:30.270
So I went to explain it now with fundamentally flawed,

24
00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:34.530
it was wrong and he wasn't measuring anything except something

25
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.420
psychological in his mind.

26
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.490
It was realized fairly early on that

27
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.630
element,

28
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.890
87 could be made from element

29
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.020
89 actinium by emission of an

30
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.910
alpha particle. An alpha particle is two protons and two neutrons.

31
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.510
So if you take two away from 89, you get 87.

32
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.390
And the problem was that actinium is quite a rare element and was very difficult

33
00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:07.890
to get hold of a sample.

34
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.330
It had been discovered by Andre TBN around about

35
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:16.980
1900, and he was working in the same Institute as Marie Curie.

36
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.960
And in 1929, a young woman, Margaret Perry,

37
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.030
went to the lab and started as a lab assistant with Marie Curie.

38
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.040
And she was put to purifying actinium you would begin with

39
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.390
literally tons of impure or probably

40
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.920
uranium. And then you would gradually boil it up,

41
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:41.880
dissolve it,

42
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.980
extract material until you ended up with just a few

43
00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:49.320
milligrams of the material you wanted.

44
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.390
The other problem was that nobody realized how dangerous radioactivity

45
00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:55.224
was.

46
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.740
So they were all working in the lab with very few precautions.

47
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.020
The upshot of this was that Margaret Perry became a real

48
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.910
expert in handling actinium and separating it four years after

49
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:12.310
she started Madame Curie died.

50
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.530
She started working simultaneously for a [inaudible]

51
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.600
the professor who had discovered actinium and also married to

52
00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:23.590
his daughter,

53
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.910
Irin [inaudible] for some completely unknown reason.

54
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.990
These two people didn't realize they were both directing the work of the same

55
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:32.620
person.

56
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.600
The aim was to get the purest possible sample of actinium

57
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.350
and then measure the radioactivity coming from it.

58
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.300
The way the acting Liam decays is entirely due to the physics of the

59
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:51.160
nucleus. The reason for purifying it is to get rid of all the other radioactive

60
00:03:51.161 --> 00:03:52.330
impurities,

61
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.220
which might send out signals that would completely mask the effect you were

62
00:03:57.221 --> 00:03:57.970
looking for.

63
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.920
So what Margaret packer observed was when she took a

64
00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:07.660
really pure solution of actinium and measured the radioactivity

65
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.810
very rapidly for the first two hours,

66
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.290
the radioactivity of the solution increased.

67
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.020
And then it came approximately constant.

68
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.510
And so she did use that.

69
00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:24.460
What was happening was that the acting was decaying to form

70
00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:25.750
a new element,

71
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.580
which itself was decaying and giving out much stronger radiation.

72
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.200
The reason you sold this buildup was because material went into

73
00:04:35.201 --> 00:04:39.640
solution and you got to a stage where it was being formed at the same rates as

74
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.900
which it was decaying.

75
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.000
She also discovered that this radioactivity could be precipitated by

76
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.370
adding cesium salt and then precipitating the cesium sold as

77
00:04:51.371 --> 00:04:56.290
the perchlorate Caesium and element 87 should have

78
00:04:56.291 --> 00:05:01.060
similar chemical properties. So you expect them to precipitate together.

79
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.040
Once it precipitated you could show that the precipitate was radioactive rather

80
00:05:06.041 --> 00:05:10.660
than the solution. And the half-life was about 21 minutes.

81
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.760
So you had to work really fast.

82
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.710
The upshot was that she had discovered element 87

83
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.020
in 1939.

84
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.370
She published her paper on element 87

85
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.860
derived from actinium.

86
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.640
Now there was a really exciting and interesting situation.

87
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.640
Margaret was an lab assistant.

88
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.380
She had no chemical qualifications apart from basic

89
00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:43.300
training, but she had enough material for a doctorate,

90
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.390
possibly even for a big prize,

91
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.180
but she couldn't submit this material for a doctorate because he didn't have a

92
00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:53.320
chemistry degree.

93
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.700
What happened was that she was allowed to go and study during the second world

94
00:05:58.701 --> 00:06:02.240
war to get the necessary certificates,

95
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:07.250
to allow us to submit her main discovery for a doctoral thesis.

96
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:12.410
Now, the interesting thing about this paper is that there is only one

97
00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:14.300
author, Margaret Peggy.

98
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:20.060
And there's the name here of [inaudible] the person who actually

99
00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:23.830
submitted this paper to the journal on her behalf. What's interesting,

100
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.900
neither of the two professors have their names on the papers.

101
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.220
And apparently after the discovery had been made,

102
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.810
they discovered that Margaret was,

103
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.230
as it were double timing them and working with both of them.

104
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.730
And neither of them could agree whose names should go on the paper.

105
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.560
And eventually they decided that she should publish just alone.

106
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.090
It was probably a misunderstanding and perhaps a

107
00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:56.960
reflection of the way that lab assistants were treated.

108
00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.650
And they actually asked her who she was working for.

109
00:07:00.651 --> 00:07:05.540
They were both ordering her about now in 1946,

110
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.880
when she submitted her thesis,

111
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.720
she was asked what name she wanted for the elements.

112
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:17.570
And she suggested that she should call it Catchum CA

113
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:22.340
T R U M because she believed that being at the

114
00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:24.800
bottom of the periodic table,

115
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:30.080
it would form ion a positive iron more easily than any other

116
00:07:30.081 --> 00:07:32.120
elements. However, Madame Curie,

117
00:07:32.121 --> 00:07:35.300
his daughter who spoke English said,

118
00:07:35.301 --> 00:07:38.660
she thought it was a bad name because English speakers would think it was

119
00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:42.290
something to do with cats, the furry animals,

120
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.290
therefore it wasn't appropriate for name of an element.

121
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:50.480
So instead the second choice was Francine named after France,

122
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:54.440
originally with the symbol F a,

123
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.800
but then this was changed at fr in fact,

124
00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:02.450
Seaborg wrote to Margaret Perry to ask, which was the correct symbol.

125
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:05.780
And she answered fr after her doctorate,

126
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:10.040
she had quite a impressive career.

127
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:15.110
She was made a professor of chemistry and she was also elected as the

128
00:08:15.111 --> 00:08:18.320
first woman to the academic decisions,

129
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.390
the French Academy of sciences,

130
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.390
the first woman since the 17th century.

131
00:08:23.391 --> 00:08:27.860
So it was really quite a triumph, but sadly,

132
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.480
because of her exposure to all these radioactive elements,

133
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.010
as she got older,

134
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:38.750
she developed chronic radiation sickness and

135
00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:41.630
problems. So towards the end of her life,

136
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:45.440
when she was really keen to do more research into France,

137
00:08:45.441 --> 00:08:49.250
SIM her health deteriorated and she died quite young in

138
00:08:49.251 --> 00:08:50.600
1975.

139
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.680
But what's exciting is that research is continuing and fancying

140
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:56.663
people. Now,

141
00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:02.250
consensus size friends assume in accelerators by the method of taking a light

142
00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:06.900
atom and a heavy one. In this case, the light item is oxygen atomic,

143
00:09:06.901 --> 00:09:10.860
number eight and gold atomic number 79,

144
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:16.140
eight plus 79 makes 87. So for example,

145
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.880
there has been an interesting paper that was published in 2005

146
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.650
on the relative rates of extraction of Francine and cesium from

147
00:09:25.651 --> 00:09:30.120
solution. And even if you have just a tiny amount of Francine,

148
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.830
because it's radioactive,

149
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:37.140
you can follow the process very easily because modern radiation

150
00:09:37.141 --> 00:09:40.980
detectors can detect even a few atoms.

151
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.710
I think from the point of view, periodic videos,

152
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:48.240
the most interesting fact is that people have measured the ionization

153
00:09:48.241 --> 00:09:49.770
energy of Francine.

154
00:09:49.771 --> 00:09:54.600
That's the energy required to remove one electron to make France

155
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:59.340
SIM plus, this is the reaction that occurs when you put the metal in water,

156
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.830
it shows just how reactive the iron.

157
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.273
<v 1>Holy crap.</v>

158
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:13.250
<v 0>Most surprisingly the amount of energy to remove the electron from</v>

159
00:10:13.251 --> 00:10:17.630
Francine is slightly greater than required to remove it from

160
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:19.183
cesium.

161
00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:26.360
So Caesium is actually a bit more reactive than Francine.

162
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.570
The difference is not very great in principle.

163
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.490
This is quite surprising because you would think that the bigger the atom,

164
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:39.560
the further the electron will be away and therefore the easier it is to remove

165
00:10:39.561 --> 00:10:40.160
it.

166
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.750
And we've seen this in our videos when we've compared the reactivity of lithium,

167
00:10:44.751 --> 00:10:49.310
which is really small with sodium potassium, rubidium, and cesium,

168
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.780
as the atoms get bigger.

169
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.640
The reason why France SIM doesn't behave as people expect is

170
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.580
due to what to call the relativistic effects.

171
00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:03.500
And we've talked about this in our video about mercury is that as

172
00:11:03.501 --> 00:11:04.910
the atom gets bigger,

173
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.760
the electrons are circulating faster and faster at

174
00:11:10.761 --> 00:11:13.640
speeds that are a fraction of the speed of light,

175
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.090
which affects the mass of the electron.

176
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:21.890
And therefore makes the atom a bit smaller than one might

177
00:11:21.891 --> 00:11:23.150
expect. Therefore,

178
00:11:23.151 --> 00:11:28.100
the electron is a little closer to the nucleus and is bound a bit more strongly

179
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.490
than it might be. Otherwise if there were not,

180
00:11:31.491 --> 00:11:34.790
these effects pattern is still much bigger than Caesium,

181
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.060
but it's not quite as big as you would expect.

182
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:43.670
And we're talking about quite a small energy difference between Caesium and, um,

183
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.883
Francine, but it's real.

184
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:50.330
So this brings me back to the fake videos.

185
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.040
Francine would not react with water more violently than Caesium.

186
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.230
So you shouldn't be surprised that I want to tear my hair out.

187
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.630
Perhaps it's understandable. Even I was wrong on one of our videos. I,

188
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.800
it, that the video of the century would be friends, him and water.

189
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.130
It would be the damp squib of the century.

190
00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.780
No one will ever see Fran Sims reacting with water because the so few

191
00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:21.610
atoms. And in fact,

192
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:26.770
the world record for getting France in Matton's in one

193
00:12:26.771 --> 00:12:30.370
place in one time is 300,000 atoms.

194
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.560
That might sound a lot,

195
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.890
but it is an unimaginable police,

196
00:12:35.891 --> 00:12:39.910
small speck of France SIM. And you wouldn't see anything.

197
00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:41.080
If you drop that into water.

198
00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:46.890
<v 2>At the moment, the cesium, you can see the lovely gold color it.</v>

199
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:52.050
Did you believe me? Smelting? I looked at it. Oh yeah. It's very warm.

200
00:12:52.051 --> 00:12:53.850
It's the season's melted.

201
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.750
So we're just going to try and freeze it again.
