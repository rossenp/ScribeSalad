1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.680
<v 0>There's been quite a lot of recent discussion about chemical weapons.</v>

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.930
So we thought it might be useful for you to know a bit about the chemistry so

3
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:12.750
that you can understand the discussions rather better.

4
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.030
<v 1>So I know a little bit about some of these things in particular nerve gases,</v>

5
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.770
just because some of the research I do looks at the nervous system and how we

6
00:00:24.771 --> 00:00:29.600
can interact with it, uh, actually to control pain rather than kill anyone.

7
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.400
<v 0>The use of chemical weapons really began in the first world war.</v>

8
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.410
First of all, they use chlorine,

9
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.710
which is a sort of yellowish gas.

10
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.350
So you could see it coming across the battlefield.

11
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.950
<v 1>You had trench warfare, these would go along,</v>

12
00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:50.300
no man's land down into the trenches and obviously Maman kill,

13
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.800
um, the, the enemy or if you've got the wind direction wrong, your own troops.

14
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.350
<v 0>Mustard gas, which is chemical weapon,</v>

15
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.450
which was used again in the Iraq Iran war in the 1980s

16
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.500
is although it's called the gas. It is actually liquid,

17
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.090
which made it particularly unpleasant because it would persist on the

18
00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:14.030
battlefield for months mustard,

19
00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:18.650
gas that was shot in the autumn could still be there in the spring and affect

20
00:01:18.651 --> 00:01:19.484
people.

21
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.140
And it caused blindness for those people who were not actually

22
00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:24.974
killed by it.

23
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.080
But the rather McCobb twists to the chemistry of mustard gas is that

24
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.390
it has since been used or derivatives of it have been

25
00:01:35.391 --> 00:01:40.310
used in medicine and more people have been saved by derivatives of

26
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.350
mustard than were killed in the various uses on the battlefield.

27
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.040
<v 1>Run up. And in particularly in the early stages of the second world war,</v>

28
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.390
I guess, both sides allies and, and the Nazis,

29
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.010
they were both developing more sophisticated chemical warfare agents,

30
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.390
presumably in case the other side used it. Uh, luckily, um,

31
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.030
although there are lots of developments were made. Um,

32
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.830
luckily there was no chemical warfare whatsoever in the second world war. And,

33
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.950
uh, none of these, uh, items got used, but nonetheless,

34
00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:17.870
the technology had been developed. Um, and so these days the,

35
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.920
you know, there's,

36
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.060
there is some knowledge out there about these more advanced systems of which

37
00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:25.460
siren is one of them. Unfortunately,

38
00:02:25.461 --> 00:02:30.080
terrorists can get hold of it. I've got a molecule of siren here.

39
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.990
Not real siren, not real, sorry. No,

40
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.550
that would be illegal to make that I've made it out of, uh, straws. And, uh,

41
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.540
these colored balls, they're quite a small molecule, uh, not many atoms.

42
00:02:41.541 --> 00:02:42.890
And that's why it's volatile.

43
00:02:42.891 --> 00:02:47.660
It's a gas or a very low boiling liquid here. We have a phosphorous,

44
00:02:47.661 --> 00:02:52.640
this purple one, these two red ones are oxygen. The black ones are carbon.

45
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.340
And the thing which makes it the reactive,

46
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.440
um, and volatile some extent, it's this one here, this is a flooring.

47
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.150
And what this does is it blocks something in all animals,

48
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.470
uh, humans, um, called tile, Coleen Estrace.

49
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.780
That's what it works on.

50
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.680
<v 0>There was great worry in the UK,</v>

51
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.920
that chemical weapons,

52
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.330
which by the time of the second world, war were much more sophisticated,

53
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.520
um, might be used. So all British citizens,

54
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.080
even babies were given respirators or gas masks,

55
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.970
and I've got my father's gas smells.

56
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.810
I think they were presented in the cardboard box,

57
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.040
but my father had this rather posh leather case made for it.

58
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.660
And if you look inside,

59
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.410
it has his name is written a political Esquire,

60
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.070
and he's got his address, his work address,

61
00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.780
and even his telephone number inside is the gas mask itself.

62
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.160
I haven't taken it out for many years and I think it might be

63
00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:08.070
perished, but let's see if we can get it out.

64
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.010
<v 1>So what is acetone Coleen Estrace,</v>

65
00:04:11.011 --> 00:04:13.650
or before I tell you what the esterase bit means,

66
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.020
I'll tell you a bit about Estelle Coleen.

67
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.040
So this is a molecule here of acid tile Coleen,

68
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.290
and this is a neurotransmitter.

69
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.660
So whenever we breathe or move our arms or do a whole range of things,

70
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.300
heartbeats and whatnot, um,

71
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.620
we use our nervous system and our brain sends a signal.

72
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.800
Now throughout most of it it's like an electrical cable,

73
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.510
but when it gets to a junction,

74
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.610
those signals that are transferred by neuro-transmitters and ask toll coding is

75
00:04:44.611 --> 00:04:49.140
one type of neurotransmitter. So this drifts across the Sinai optic gap,

76
00:04:49.141 --> 00:04:53.010
the junction and it triggers the next response.

77
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.540
And that response might be the arm moves or lungs breathe.

78
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.670
<v 0>I think I may need to stand up for this. Yeah. So here are the straps,</v>

79
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.860
but let's see what's left in sight. When you.

80
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.040
<v 1>You want that response to die off,</v>

81
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.530
what happens is this drifts away from its receptor and a molecule

82
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.980
like a Pac-Man comes along and choose this up.

83
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.730
And that molecule is called a acid tile, Coleen asteroid.

84
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.970
So that's totally natural. A very good thing. Very good thing,

85
00:05:23.971 --> 00:05:26.700
because otherwise, if you move your arm, it would always be there.

86
00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:30.830
You wouldn't be able to stop it and get it, come back. And again,

87
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.450
the breathing you'd be always breathing out, not breathing in.

88
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.880
<v 0>There's something coming. So here we are,</v>

89
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.900
this is not a completely come off.

90
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.890
And there is an IPS.

91
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.880
And the thing that you breathe through.

92
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.950
<v 1>So you need this to go on.</v>

93
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.950
And this happens in milliseconds is incredibly quick, incredibly quick.

94
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.440
And all that happens is that it's our style.

95
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:03.560
Cody in Australia's comes along and it takes the end off.

96
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.130
This is now vinegar over here,

97
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.980
and the other bit is Coleen.

98
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.330
And that gets recycled to make more as style Coleen in the receptor end.

99
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.590
<v 0>Well, you can't see very much. It's a bit dirty.</v>

100
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.020
I can just about see the camera.

101
00:06:20.021 --> 00:06:24.940
I couldn't drive in this and what it would have been like walking in

102
00:06:24.941 --> 00:06:27.670
the complete darkness of blackouts. I've no idea.

103
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.320
<v 1>So that process is going on and on and on constantly in our bodies.</v>

104
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:36.160
And what siren does is it comes along

105
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.500
and the molecule, which, which takes this ends group off here, let's,

106
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.620
let's call it this, uh, thing here.

107
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.600
It's this O H which is gonna happen. And that's the,

108
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.860
the Pac-Man molecule comes along. It swaps that for that.

109
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.450
And then water comes in and takes this off to make a Ctech acid

110
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.510
or sarin comes along and it's got a much more active

111
00:07:04.511 --> 00:07:08.920
group. The flooring is really reactive, that goes,

112
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.640
and this attaches on, but now water,

113
00:07:15.641 --> 00:07:16.840
can't take this off again.

114
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.820
So it's just soaked up one of these Pac-Man molecules as Tel Colina Australia's

115
00:07:21.821 --> 00:07:25.000
molecules. Well, now you see it's not available

116
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.460
to break down the Aztec Coleen in your body.

117
00:07:30.461 --> 00:07:34.120
So you've always got an on switch on your muscles.

118
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.210
And the thing which is deadly is, is you breathing.

119
00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.940
Cause obviously your lungs and muscles, they move in and out.

120
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:44.800
And if they don't go one way and don't go back the other way, then, you know,

121
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:49.150
you're, you're very quickly diversification, which is why you see, uh,

122
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:53.230
in all these news reports, people with really bad breathing problems.

123
00:07:53.231 --> 00:07:57.850
And it's because they can't get those muscles to work correctly

124
00:07:57.851 --> 00:08:02.620
because the Coleen Estrace has been mopped up by the sarin

125
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.100
and the water can't hydrolyze.

126
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:11.980
<v 0>Inside here will be activated carbon</v>

127
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:13.750
charcoal,

128
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:18.640
which has a very large surface area and will absorb the molecules of the

129
00:08:18.641 --> 00:08:22.780
poison gas. And I believed,

130
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.480
or I'm not certain that they found that coconut

131
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.360
Chaco was by far the best Y from coconuts. I don't know.

132
00:08:31.361 --> 00:08:34.330
It just probably gave a higher surface area.

133
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.310
<v 1>So there is an antidote. And of course,</v>

134
00:08:36.311 --> 00:08:41.230
whenever chemists have designed in the past poisonous things,

135
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.470
obviously they don't want to kill themselves. They're clever guys.

136
00:08:44.471 --> 00:08:46.420
They invent some sort of antidote.

137
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.080
And the antidote is this molecule it's called prowl doxing.

138
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.170
And this is like super water.

139
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:58.740
So here's an oxygen here and it's connected to this nitrogen and that makes

140
00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:03.510
this oxygen about hundreds of 300 times more reactive than normal

141
00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:04.344
water.

142
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:09.210
And that can come along and displace the siren from the Estelle

143
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.610
coli in Australia. And that can go back it's business again.

144
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:16.460
<v 0>Now, the other thing, which is perhaps more interesting is this,</v>

145
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:21.020
which I bought as a school boy in the early 1960s.

146
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.300
As far as I remember, I paid five shillings for it,

147
00:09:26.301 --> 00:09:31.250
25 UK Pentz and 60 at that

148
00:09:31.251 --> 00:09:33.230
time, 60 us cents.

149
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.590
So not very much inside if you look,

150
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.410
this is a kit,

151
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:44.210
a military kit for detecting poisonous gases,

152
00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.090
and here are the instructions how to use it here.

153
00:09:47.091 --> 00:09:50.840
There's a whole lab of little different vessels.

154
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:54.230
And underneath is essentially

155
00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.870
what is a bicycle pump,

156
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.320
except instead of pumping things up,

157
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.440
it sucks air through a hole at the top,

158
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:10.850
you put the chemical tests to here and then you punch like this and it sucks air

159
00:10:10.851 --> 00:10:11.860
through. So you've got,

160
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:16.430
imagine me now wearing a gas mask and gloves because there may be chemicals.

161
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.440
It was that you put the thing in here, and then out of here,

162
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.350
you took a small paper disc.

163
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:28.430
So imagine wearing gloves and the battle raging around me.

164
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:33.230
And you put a chemical, this piece of filter paper in here,

165
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:38.480
and then you start mixing up solutions here and start pumping away and see if

166
00:10:38.481 --> 00:10:39.320
you get to color.

167
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:46.580
<v 1>Totally. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's horrendous. The,</v>

168
00:10:46.581 --> 00:10:50.480
the lethal dose for this is around one milligram,

169
00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:55.610
far smaller than the smallest sort of a sweetener pill that you might put in

170
00:10:55.611 --> 00:10:57.320
your coffee. For example,

171
00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.760
we think of Sinai sodium cyanide is being quite dangerous,

172
00:11:01.761 --> 00:11:06.380
but you'd need sort of half a teaspoon full of that. So you can see these are,

173
00:11:06.381 --> 00:11:10.820
these are, you know, around thousand times more deadly than,

174
00:11:10.821 --> 00:11:15.290
than even Sinai item. We all know that that was a horrendous.

175
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:20.150
<v 0>I think one of the problems of chemical weapons is that they are</v>

176
00:11:20.151 --> 00:11:25.040
not targeted at particular individuals in the way

177
00:11:25.041 --> 00:11:27.140
that you would. If you shoot a gun at them.

178
00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.520
<v 1>You can't control them. I mean,</v>

179
00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:31.280
if you're aiming a bomb or a missile at a building, you're,

180
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:35.030
you're aiming at that building, but if you release a gas,

181
00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.220
it's going to go over the wind, blows it.

182
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.600
And there's no control of who's in the way and who isn't.

183
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:46.610
<v 0>Also that the members of society who are most</v>

184
00:11:46.611 --> 00:11:50.360
vulnerable, old people, young children,

185
00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:55.000
are those that are likely to suffer most from chemical weapons.

186
00:11:55.030 --> 00:12:00.010
Because if you know the chemical weapons about, and you're properly equipped,

187
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:03.370
such as soldiers with all their battlefield kit,

188
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.640
then they're relatively little danger.

189
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:11.290
You cannot easily protect yourself from exploding

190
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.760
bombs if they're big ones, but you can from chemical weapons.

191
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.940
So part of the revulsion,

192
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.940
I think that everyone feels about chemical weapons is that they're not targeted

193
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.540
to individuals and innocent bystanders can so easily

194
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.300
be injured or killed.

195
00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.550
<v 2>So I look at the blue one, the nitrogen,</v>

196
00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:40.350
this is a cat time that Tetra trimethyl ammonium species.

197
00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:45.720
<v 0>There is a huge problem now that there are aging</v>

198
00:12:45.721 --> 00:12:50.520
stockpiles and various places of chemical weapons that need to be

199
00:12:50.521 --> 00:12:51.450
destroyed.
