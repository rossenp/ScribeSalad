00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.830
<v 0>Even really simple experiments can sometimes teach you</v>

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.890
interesting things and then expected things.

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.040
Especially if you look at the temperatures,

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.370
what we're going to do is to show you two different experiments.

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.750
The first one is pouring sulfuric acid into water.

6
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.430
A thermal imaging camera cannot penetrate water and it cannot penetrate

7
00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:30.540
glass. So we've done the experiment in a plastic beaker.

8
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.340
So you can see through the beaker and see the inside surface of the

9
00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:39.390
water. Now, the acid is much denser than water,

10
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.980
so it sinks to the bottom,

11
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.110
but then the water begins to dilute the acid and the acid

12
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.230
interacts with the water and generates heat.

13
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.940
The interaction is the water molecules interacting

14
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.890
with the H class irons and the SL four, two minus ions.

15
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.340
So the Catalans and the unknowns from the acid,

16
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.750
and since the acid we're pouring in already has some water.

17
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.690
There will be a degree of ionization. And when you diluted,

18
00:01:10.691 --> 00:01:15.420
it will ionize more and there's more water that can solve it.

19
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.940
That's interact with each of the aims.

20
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.800
So if you watch the first thing that's interesting is that the acid layer

21
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.060
gets really hot. But the next thing that's interesting is that, you know,

22
00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:28.770
that hot things rise,

23
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.660
but the acid layer stays hot and the water on top stays relatively

24
00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:34.470
cold.

25
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.150
And the reason for this is that the acid is far denser

26
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.970
than the water. So even with the heating,

27
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.370
it's not light enough to convict up.

28
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.170
And so what you have to do is to stir the acid with the rod,

29
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.480
and then it starts mixing things up.

30
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.540
I was quite surprised by the lack of convection,

31
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.190
but it really demonstrates how important it is to start a reaction

32
00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:00.024
mixture,

33
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.350
okay, stir it. And we're doing some reaction each time you pulled in the acid,

34
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.480
you pour it in slightly differently.

35
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.450
And each time you might get a slightly different result.

36
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.780
So if you want to make a really reproducible experiment,

37
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.370
you need to stir it hard all the time. The obvious next step.

38
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.610
And our second experiment is to see what happens.

39
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.570
If you dissolve an alkaline metal hydroxide in water,

40
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.810
these hydroxides are solids room temperature,

41
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.040
and they are sold as pellets, rather like small beads.

42
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.580
And when you tip these beads into water,

43
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.590
they sink to the bottom and then the water begins to dissolve the pellets.

44
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.450
Now you've got to understand that the solid consists

45
00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.790
of metal and metal plus and minus,

46
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.230
and there's a whole array of these, not just two irons and the irons,

47
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.180
because the metal plus is attracted to a minus require energy

48
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:14.320
to separate them. And that energy has to be put in.

49
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.470
However, because these irons are small,

50
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.570
they interact with the water and the water molecules interacting

51
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:26.800
with both the positive ions and the negative ions give out heat.

52
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.720
In the case of alkaline metal,

53
00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:32.650
hydroxides the energy that you get from the water.

54
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:35.770
Interacting with the ions is more than the energy.

55
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.930
Then you need to pull those irons apart.

56
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.280
So overall desolving hydroxides generates heat.

57
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.990
So if we look those pellets at the bottom of the beaker start

58
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.670
glowing, quite hot,

59
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.720
and the solution just above it starts to glue hot,

60
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.670
but just like the acid, that solution is very dense,

61
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.340
far denser than ordinary water.

62
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.670
So it doesn't shoot up towards the surface,

63
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.690
but that concentrated layer gets hotter and hotter.

64
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.700
And you have to be quite careful because you can generate a lot of

65
00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:17.230
heat without realizing it just as before. If you stir it,

66
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.430
you can get that heat to go up into the bulk of the solution.

67
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.900
But unlike the acid, because the pellets are solid,

68
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.390
they stay at the bottom of the beaker.

69
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.870
So you keep on generating the heat at the bottom of the beaker,

70
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.140
but very slowly you can see the heat spreading.

71
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.580
If I'd been asked beforehand what would happen with the temperature in these two

72
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.080
and how they would behave. If I thought a long time, I might have guessed,

73
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.720
but even to me, it was quite a surprise to see this in reality, yeah.

74
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.370
Process that's generating the heat is fundamentally the same.

75
00:05:02.371 --> 00:05:05.520
In both cases, this is water molecules,

76
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.880
interacting with positive and negative ions.

77
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.680
The way they interact is very slightly different because in one case you have a

78
00:05:13.681 --> 00:05:17.010
metal lion that is positive. In the other case,

79
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.610
you have an H plus sign of proton, which is very,

80
00:05:20.611 --> 00:05:24.630
very much smaller because H plus doesn't have any electrons around it.

81
00:05:24.631 --> 00:05:28.980
So the quantum mechanics of the interaction is slightly different,

82
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.450
but on a more global scale, the mechanism is pretty similar.

83
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.340
So what the take home message is is that both acids and

84
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.930
alkalize dissolve in water, generating heat and very dense.

85
