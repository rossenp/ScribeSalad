1
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.700
<v 1>The best book for non chemists to get a basic understanding of chemistry.</v>

2
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.950
And what is your favorite fiction book?

3
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.500
<v 2>I have no idea which book to recommend to you because books like</v>

4
00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:22.010
teachers, some people get on really well with one teacher.

5
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.950
Some people prefer a different teacher.

6
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.550
So it's which author you relate to.

7
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.800
I very much like the book by Primo LaVey called the periodic table,

8
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.360
but it may not suit everybody. I don't read very much fiction.

9
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.260
And if I do read fiction, I usually only read once.

10
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.850
What's the last fiction book you read. The

11
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.910
last fiction book I read was by, um,

12
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.570
Owen Matthews. I've forgotten his title.

13
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.030
It's a murder mystery set in a Russian

14
00:01:02.031 --> 00:01:05.780
town in the 19 early 1950s.

15
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.440
When the H-bomb was being constructed there.

16
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.790
<v 1>Videos, we often see experiments fail, but in a factory,</v>

17
00:01:13.791 --> 00:01:17.660
the same chemical reaction will be flawlessly executed with perfect

18
00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:19.610
predictability. Why?

19
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.540
<v 2>When we do experiments, we're doing them for the first time, at least for us.</v>

20
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.630
So there are lots of things we don't know yet.

21
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.440
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

22
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.990
<v 2>If you're building a chemical factory,</v>

23
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.230
you will put in a lot of chemical engineering,

24
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.330
you will know all of the aspects of the reaction and you've

25
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.120
calculated the rates of reactions and so on.

26
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.170
So you've done the experiments hundreds of times,

27
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.700
and you've got it readily to work.

28
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.090
<v 1>Working with so many different chemicals through the years.</v>

29
00:01:59.091 --> 00:02:00.980
I'm sure you've had a few scares,

30
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.850
but was there ever an incident when you were genuinely fearful for your life?

31
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.313
<v 2>No.</v>

32
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.300
I think chemists have to work safely.

33
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.250
I suppose the scariest incident they had was when I was a

34
00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:20.480
student doing my doctorate and they put

35
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.640
500 pounds per square inch pressure of hydrogen gas by

36
00:02:25.641 --> 00:02:27.680
mistake into a glass bulb.

37
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.380
And the bulb exploded and bits of glass

38
00:02:33.381 --> 00:02:36.020
were found all over my hair,

39
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.810
but fortunately I wasn't injured at all.

40
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.450
We were in safety specs in those days,

41
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.290
people who wore glasses were not given safety glasses.

42
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.300
So I actually glued some state pieces onto one of my pairs of

43
00:02:50.301 --> 00:02:51.440
glasses after that.

44
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.360
<v 1>What is your best advice in teaching chemistry that will help me become an even</v>

45
00:02:56.361 --> 00:03:00.190
better teacher. First of all, let me say that. When.

46
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.060
<v 2>I talk to professional chemists and ask them,</v>

47
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:05.830
why did you become a chemist?

48
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.840
They nearly always say because I had an inspirational chemistry teacher

49
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.800
and I had a great teacher called Tony Roberts.

50
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.350
<v 1>I'm Tony Roberts. I taught Martin chemistry 50 years ago.</v>

51
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.150
<v 2>I behave badly in his class, but he still inspired me.</v>

52
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.860
So I think the most important thing for any sort of teaching is

53
00:03:28.861 --> 00:03:32.910
enthusiasm. If you find the subject boring,

54
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.830
haven't helped the pupils.

55
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.870
So I think you've got to convey the idea that you think the work is

56
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.630
interesting and you like it.

57
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.870
I was once lecturing to students about something I thought was really boring.

58
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.230
Substitution and octahedral cobalt complex is the whole

59
00:03:55.231 --> 00:03:59.100
class was silent. And I suddenly thought, gosh,

60
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.570
they think it's interesting.

61
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.180
And I worked myself up into such a state of excitement that I couldn't

62
00:04:06.181 --> 00:04:08.040
do anything for the rest of the morning.

63
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.850
<v 1>Dear professor Poliakoff, what is your favorite cheese?</v>

64
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.970
<v 2>I don't like blue cheese very much, but I like most other cheeses.</v>

65
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.310
I once published the paper with my colleague, George Davidson,

66
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.390
analyzing cheese, in fact,

67
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.100
analyzing low fat cheese and comparing with normal cheese.

68
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.780
I was so embarrassed that I published a paper with the word

69
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.880
cheese in the title that I didn't put it in my CV

70
00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:43.320
for many, many years.

71
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.350
<v 1>What's wrong with having cheese in the title?</v>

72
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.750
<v 2>Well, I thought it was not very didn't sound very scientific.</v>

73
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.270
<v 1>What will you do when you retire?</v>

74
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.280
<v 2>One can never foresee the future,</v>

75
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.130
but I'm not planning to retire immediately, but who knows?

76
00:05:02.131 --> 00:05:04.110
What's going to happen to one in the future.

77
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.660
<v 1>How many periodic table ties do.</v>

78
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.890
<v 2>You have? I'm not sure because I have two collections,</v>

79
00:05:10.891 --> 00:05:14.230
one at home and one here at the university and the.

80
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.413
<v 1>University one.</v>

81
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.460
<v 2>And the tires sometimes travel between the two.</v>

82
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.620
I think it's more than a dozen.

83
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.500
I rarely wear a tie without the periodic table on

84
00:05:28.501 --> 00:05:33.300
it. I've never even gone really dark one that is suitable for funerals.

85
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.470
You can't really see the elements very well, but I know they're there.

86
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.640
I have a theory which might

87
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.150
amuse some of you that wearing a tie may help mitigate

88
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.140
global warming because you see when you have a tie,

89
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.590
it constrains your collar around your neck.

90
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.930
So hot air gets trapped in your shirt.

91
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.500
So you feel warmer so you can turn the heating down.

92
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.880
So if you wear a tie less CO2,

93
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.710
it's discharged in the atmosphere. So save the planet and wear a tie.

94
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.060
<v 1>How do you relax in your free time sleep?</v>

95
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.030
You go to the movies a lot.

96
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.020
<v 2>So I go to, well, my wife is very keen on cinema,</v>

97
00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.480
so we go quite a bit to the cinema.

98
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.790
And you probably know that my brother is a movie director and

99
00:06:30.791 --> 00:06:34.600
writer. You can buy his DVDs on Amazon.

100
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.320
So I do enjoy going to send them out.

101
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.490
And my mother was an actor though. She didn't perform very much,

102
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.240
but there is a big tradition of performing in our family.

103
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.140
<v 1>Is it true that you sometimes leave when you're bored and go and work out in the</v>

104
00:06:50.141 --> 00:06:52.270
corridor though and leave your wife for what you're on her own?

105
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.870
<v 2>Yes. Um, the cinema has very good wifi.</v>

106
00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.280
And so if the film bores me or frightens me,

107
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.010
I go out and work on my computer.

108
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.080
<v 1>A lot of people asked about this.</v>

109
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.640
What advances in chemistry will be most important for preventing or

110
00:07:09.641 --> 00:07:13.150
mitigating climate change besides wearing ties?

111
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:18.370
<v 2>I think the important thing is to find ways of providing</v>

112
00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:23.080
energy without generating CO2 or

113
00:07:23.081 --> 00:07:24.640
large amounts of CO2.

114
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.620
It is not just a question of chemistry because it involves lots of engineering.

115
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.980
The chemistry may be the underlying principle,

116
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:37.330
but getting it to work on a lot of scale is definitely engineering.

117
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.540
So engineers and chemists have to work together.

118
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:46.300
The really important things that need to be done is to learn how to

119
00:07:46.301 --> 00:07:50.800
harness the energy from the sun really efficiently.

120
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:52.660
For example,

121
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.700
new catalyst to split water into hydrogen and oxygen,

122
00:07:57.701 --> 00:07:58.900
using sunlight.

123
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:04.120
Then you can burn the hydrogen to fuel cars and other sorts

124
00:08:04.121 --> 00:08:07.540
of transport. Then there is the question of batteries.

125
00:08:07.541 --> 00:08:12.100
So you can store electrical energy that you've generated with photo cells,

126
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:17.260
making cheaper photo cells that last longer that use

127
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.200
all of the spectrum of the light from the sun.

128
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.400
My hope is that chemists are going to succeed.

129
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.210
If they don't, we'll all fry.

130
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:33.100
As the temperature just goes up and up in the Earth's atmosphere.

131
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.980
<v 1>We had so many questions about this, I guess I better ask,</v>

132
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:40.150
how do you maintain your majestic hair? How do you prepare it?

133
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:41.380
What's your hair regime?

134
00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:47.230
<v 2>So my hair is what I was born with and I don't do</v>

135
00:08:47.231 --> 00:08:50.410
very much apart from occasionally brushing it.

136
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:55.530
I haven't been to a barber since 1967.

137
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.010
My wife cuts my hair occasionally

138
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.860
when she's persuaded me that it looks totally ridiculous.

139
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:20.270
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>
