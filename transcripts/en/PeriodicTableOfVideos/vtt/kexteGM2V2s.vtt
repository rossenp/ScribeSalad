00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.580
<v 0>Neil, our technician suddenly got inspiration from his own physics teacher.</v>

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.440
He's devised a machine which will allow him to put a high current

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.240
through a piece of thin wire. And as he turns the knob,

4
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.640
the current goes up and up and up until the wire fails. Ready when you,

5
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.770
after this one. So we started with copper.

6
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.430
What happens is that as you put the current through the copper,

7
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.540
it gets hotter and hotter and hotter. And in this case,

8
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.810
copper melts before it catches fire.

9
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.210
So suddenly you see the wire sinking down and down

10
00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:43.890
and down, and eventually it breaks. And as it breaks,

11
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.000
there is a flash as the cup of vaporizes.

12
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.080
And you may remember that copper gives a nice green color in the vapor.

13
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.800
So you see very quick flash to bring light.

14
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.730
So Neo has a great ambition to try and burn aluminum.

15
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.560
So he got a piece of aluminum wire and heated it up,

16
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.870
but like copper Allen mini melts before it catches fire

17
00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:22.370
in the air. So suddenly it starts cycling,

18
00:01:22.371 --> 00:01:26.600
cycling, cycling, and after a little bit it breaks.

19
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.793
<v 1>Yes.</v>

20
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.390
<v 0>Neil was a bit disappointed, nothing burned.</v>

21
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.040
So we tried magnesium didn't have magnesium wire.

22
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.870
So we tried magnesium ribbon. That's relatively flat material.

23
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.000
And as you heat that because the heated metal

24
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.530
expands,

25
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.940
the magnesium started arching upwards,

26
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.070
and then suddenly it drew.

27
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.370
<v 1>Okay.</v>

28
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.540
<v 0>But as probably many of you know, that once you've set fire to magnesium,</v>

29
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.950
it keeps burning.

30
00:02:06.951 --> 00:02:11.150
So the whole lot burnt away with clouds of white

31
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.350
smoke, which essentially is finely divided. Magnesium oxide.

32
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.430
Magnesium is a metal that once you light it,

33
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.840
it generates so much heat that the burning becomes

34
00:02:29.841 --> 00:02:31.040
self-sustaining.

35
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.010
It's probably because the metal doesn't conduct away the heat very much from the

36
00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:40.640
area that's burning, whereas aluminium and copper,

37
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.080
if you set it on fire and remove the source of heat,

38
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.820
it quickly goes out. Probably the metal just cools down to false.

39
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.793
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

40
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.690
<v 0>Neil suddenly remembered he had some special way,</v>

41
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.780
or he took Brady to his special store. He calls it the dark hole.

42
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.150
Doesn't want me going there?

43
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.680
I might start taking things from it in the dark hole.

44
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.940
What's the remains of a superconducting magnets,

45
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.380
very powerful magnet that gets used in an instrument some years ago,

46
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.430
the magnet consists of a coil and Neil cutoff,

47
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.380
a piece of this alloy,

48
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.730
the wire that's used for this magnets has to be insulated.

49
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.290
Otherwise it would short circuit and it's insulated with Val niche.

50
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.390
So as it heats up,

51
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.350
there's a bit of smoking as the varnish vaporizer,

52
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.850
Slightly disappointingly. It behaves much the same as the other metal.

53
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.130
<v 1>Sykes flashes and breaks</v>

54
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.933
necks.

55
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.040
<v 0>Neil produced a piece of tungsten wire tungsten wire is what's used in</v>

56
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.770
old fashioned light bulbs. It was really interesting as you heat it up,

57
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.810
it gets hotter and hotter.

58
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.400
Tungsten has the highest melting point of any of the metals that we used,

59
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.950
and it starts to burn doesn't melt at all

60
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.630
and just gets thinner and thinner and thinner until it fails.

61
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.850
He ended up with quite a terrifying looking spike of

62
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.040
really narrow tungsten.

63
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.060
<v 1>So professor, this did fire quite quickly, but light bulbs don't fail quickly.</v>

64
00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:54.730
Ideally.

65
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.220
<v 0>What's the difference between this and a light bulb?</v>

66
00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.990
The difference from the light bulb is that in the light bulb,

67
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.790
the tungsten is not as hot as at the end of Neil's

68
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.870
experiment.

69
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.700
And of course the bulb itself is filled with argon gas rather

70
00:05:11.701 --> 00:05:13.260
than with air Neil.

71
00:05:13.261 --> 00:05:18.030
And I were both really quite fascinated by this very narrow spike that is

72
00:05:18.031 --> 00:05:18.864
made.

73
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.790
And I think it just because one part of the wire must've started

74
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.530
getting thinner than the rest and therefore hotter and therefore preferentially,

75
00:05:28.531 --> 00:05:33.300
the hottest part will have burned. Fastest Brady really wanted to do gold.

76
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.140
Neil was a bit reticent. Gold is expensive.

77
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.290
So he puts a glass dish underneath.

78
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.150
Now I must say that gold was probably the most disappointing of the mall

79
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.010
because it's heated up it melted. It broke

80
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.030
it didn't give a really very convincing flash gold.

81
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.030
Doesn't have a beautiful green color like copper, but Brady was satisfied.

82
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.340
Uh, Neil didn't lose any gold.

83
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.060
I think the most exciting metal,

84
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.030
and this was a real surprise with molybdenum.

85
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.340
When we heated up molybdenum,

86
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.570
even when I was watching the camera from the distance,

87
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.770
there seem to be some sort of pulsating on the picture.

88
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.160
And when we looked at the metal afterwards,

89
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.770
it was extraordinary because instead of having a smooth

90
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.633
wire,

91
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.740
there were little blobs of molybdenum metal all the way along the

92
00:06:41.741 --> 00:06:46.180
wire and these blobs were really quite evenly

93
00:06:46.181 --> 00:06:47.014
spaced.

94
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:04.330
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

95
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.980
<v 0>No, it turns out that this phenomenon has been seen in exploding wires</v>

96
00:07:08.981 --> 00:07:13.390
using very high-speed cameras. I think it's unusual. I,

97
00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:18.130
and none of my colleagues had seen anything like this before. Now.

98
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.690
You probably,

99
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.860
or some of you who are specialists in this area probably have some really good

100
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.260
explanation of why this happened.

101
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:31.510
I think what happened is that the molybdenum metal began to

102
00:07:31.511 --> 00:07:33.940
melt on the surface of the wire.

103
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:39.760
So you mentioned the wire covered with a thin layer of liquid.

104
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.790
And because liquid has surface tension,

105
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.790
this is why liquid forms drops.

106
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:51.190
I think that the liquid separated into little drops

107
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.890
because the surface tension pulled it together.

108
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:59.890
And so you get what would normally be little drops

109
00:07:59.891 --> 00:08:03.190
of liquid, but they solidified.

110
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:07.030
So we've somehow got them fossilized along this wire,

111
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:11.980
all my colleagues that I've shown these bits of wire to have got really excited.

112
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:16.510
It's really surprising that you can get such an even spacing.

113
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:21.820
I did a bit of research on this phenomenon and I came across a word

114
00:08:21.821 --> 00:08:26.350
I'd never heard before called under Lloyds until Lloyd is the word that

115
00:08:26.351 --> 00:08:29.440
mathematicians use to describe this sort of object.

116
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:34.450
I would be very interested to hear from any of you who has a really good

117
00:08:34.451 --> 00:08:36.310
explanation of what's happened.

118
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:42.610
Neil thinks that the spacing might be related to the frequency of

119
00:08:42.611 --> 00:08:43.450
the mains.

120
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.340
So he's keen to try and use direct current rather than alternating current

121
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:52.870
and see whether we get the same effect. I think there'll be no difference.

122
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:58.980
I had the, that we should turn the operators through 90 degrees.

123
00:08:58.981 --> 00:09:03.810
So the wire is vertical and it would be much more difficult for it to sag.

124
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:08.790
And what we found was indeed it didn't sag so

125
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:11.550
much, at least until it broke.

126
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:16.710
And we got a much better shot of the flash of

127
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.860
green light as the cup of vaporized,

128
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:24.960
there was still slight bending, but it was much less than before,

129
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.880
just as we were packing up,

130
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:31.020
I persuaded Neil to make a coil of copper.

131
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.390
We put this coil vertically.

132
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.620
My idea was that the COI would be floppier than the straight piece of wire.

133
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.240
So it might sink more,

134
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.800
but then it collapsed quite spectacularly once it did.

135
00:09:58.820 --> 00:09:59.150
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

136
00:09:59.150 --> 00:09:59.751
<v 0>Chemically.</v>

137
00:09:59.751 --> 00:10:04.640
What was interesting to me was that if you looked at the bit that was broken,

138
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:09.830
you could see the black copper to oxide on the surface of the

139
00:10:09.831 --> 00:10:14.420
copper showing that there was at least some reaction with oxygen,

140
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:17.540
but very much less than saying the burning magnesium.

141
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.800
I was really grateful to Neil because he devised a demonstration,

142
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.170
which almost turned into an experiment,

143
00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:29.810
which made me think I'd never thought that piece of molybdenum wire

144
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.760
could be in the least bit interesting.

145
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:37.040
And here I am the day after Neil did the experiment still thinking about

146
00:10:37.041 --> 00:10:41.960
it and anything that makes scientists think is really good and

147
00:10:41.961 --> 00:10:44.600
anything that makes us think differently. Yeah.

148
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:45.170
<v 1>Brilliant.</v>
