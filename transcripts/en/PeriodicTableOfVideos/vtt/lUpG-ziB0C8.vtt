1
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.900
<v 0>Yes. Well, I'm not sure I really need the miles.</v>

2
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.490
[inaudible] you? We do break. So let's take this off. Where did that come from?

3
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.900
I made it myself. So it's unique.

4
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.100
I suppose I've always felt it's quite difficult to do unique things with the

5
00:00:20.101 --> 00:00:21.420
periodic table,

6
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.950
but I wanted to tell you about something else that I did,

7
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.610
which I thought was unique as well with the periodic table.

8
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.740
<v 1>What very nice segue professor.</v>

9
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.340
<v 0>It started a long time before, um,</v>

10
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.120
locked down perhaps nearly five years ago.

11
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.800
I was playing on my computer one afternoon and decided,

12
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.750
I can't remember why to flip the horizontal of the periodic

13
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:51.330
table using PowerPoint.

14
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.850
So what was pointing up suddenly pointed down and it was a sort of

15
00:00:56.851 --> 00:01:00.510
joke. But then when I looked at it,

16
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.800
I was really quite surprised because the periodic table

17
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.810
turned out to look something like this. Of course, the first time I did it,

18
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.060
the letters weren't the right way round.

19
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.200
I thought it was good if you thought about the periodic table, like a graph,

20
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.520
because when it's a graph, if you have the zero here,

21
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.410
things normally increase in this direction and that one,

22
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.790
then the periodic table, they increase in this direction,

23
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.710
but everything like weight and so on increases when you get it downwards.

24
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.260
So it's a bit sort of upside down. And this is really difficult.

25
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.700
When we talk to chemists to our students about how the

26
00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:49.050
electrons fill up to give you the structure of the periodic table.

27
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.220
It's got a German name, it's called the outbound principle,

28
00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:55.410
meaning the building up principle.

29
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.440
Somehow it doesn't sound good to the students.

30
00:01:58.441 --> 00:02:02.490
If you say this means building up and then you do it downwards.

31
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.190
So I got quite excited about this and I wrote a little article about

32
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.080
how having the periodic table, the other way up might be better.

33
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.550
Certainly from the point of view of teaching. And I wrote to, um,

34
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.160
an expert on the periodic table and said,

35
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.270
had he ever seen one like this? And he said, no.

36
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.070
So I got really excited.

37
00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:29.580
Perhaps I'd done something new with the periodic table.

38
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.990
So I sent it to the journal and the editor was quite excited.

39
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.600
But then he said, hang on a minute.

40
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.640
Perhaps people will read it like a book from the left to the right and

41
00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:44.100
starting at the top rather than the bottom,

42
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.910
where all the interesting elements like hydrogen and helium are,

43
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.410
and they'll concentrate too much on the heavy elements at the top.

44
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.910
So we were stuck.

45
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.870
And then I suddenly remembered that my daughter,

46
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.070
who's an experimental psychologist who specializes in

47
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.480
measuring where people look tracking their eyes when they look at the picture.

48
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.940
And so they could see whether I was looking at Brady or the camera,

49
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.030
whatever I decided I would collaborate with her,

50
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.590
never collaborated with my daughter before in the scientific project.

51
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.450
So she entered colleague Alexis set up an experiment,

52
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.670
not a very big one with 24 subjects so that people weren't

53
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:34.660
biased. They used a blank periodic table with all the squares,

54
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.070
but not the letters. And the results were really quite surprising.

55
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.230
What they found was that if you look at an ordinary

56
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:45.250
periodic table,

57
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.930
you begin by looking in the middle and then your eyes go to the top where

58
00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:54.280
hydrogen and helium are. But with the inverted periodic table,

59
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.290
you still begin in the middle,

60
00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.190
but your eyes gives downwards to the hydrogen and helium.

61
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.140
So we could prove to the editor

62
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.270
that the way people looked at our periodic table was different from a book.

63
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.600
<v 2>Why is that professor does, does the paper,</v>

64
00:04:12.601 --> 00:04:16.260
or did your daughter conclude why no matter where you put those elements,

65
00:04:16.261 --> 00:04:19.740
hydrogen and helium and you know, the well that's where you go.

66
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.980
<v 0>Kids because the picture, well,</v>

67
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.630
the periodic table is relatively symmetrical where

68
00:04:27.631 --> 00:04:31.830
the lanthanides and active for nights and heavy elements are,

69
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.000
but at the bottom or the top, depending on which one you're looking at,

70
00:04:36.001 --> 00:04:39.840
where hydrogen helium are, they're a bit unsymmetrical.

71
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.090
And I think your eye is drawn to things that are unsymmetrical.

72
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.910
And there was also thought that perhaps the upside

73
00:04:50.911 --> 00:04:55.890
down periodic table looked a bit like an animal with legs. Um,

74
00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.540
but that wasn't really proved one way or another.

75
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.380
The numbers were significant,

76
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.390
but the difference wasn't huge,

77
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.940
but it was enough to convince us. And more importantly,

78
00:05:11.941 --> 00:05:16.740
the editor and the referee. So the tip was a real effect.

79
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.330
And if you're interested,

80
00:05:18.331 --> 00:05:22.860
you can read all the details in the supplementary information,

81
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:23.763
the paper,

82
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.340
there was then quite a long delay because chemistry journal

83
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.510
had never published a paper involving human subjects.

84
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.950
And there was a lot of extra paperwork, but it was published.

85
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.140
And I was really excited to have a paper with my name

86
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.330
and Ellen's name together.

87
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.530
<v 2>Oppressor Bay on us. Cause it's just you, me and the periodic videos.</v>

88
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.030
Viewers was this bit of like a gimmick or a publicity stunt, or what,

89
00:05:54.031 --> 00:05:55.200
what are you trying to achieve here?

90
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.480
You're not seriously trying to get every table on a wall and a textbook in the

91
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:00.850
world, flipped upside down. Yeah.

92
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.950
<v 0>What I wanted to do was to make people think differently about the periodic</v>

93
00:06:05.951 --> 00:06:06.784
table.

94
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.920
I am showered by people sending me different sorts of the

95
00:06:11.921 --> 00:06:16.810
periodic table saying theirs is much better than the conventional one

96
00:06:16.811 --> 00:06:20.590
and so on. I don't think I was any better than any other one,

97
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.870
but for some purposes like explaining the filling of the electron shells could

98
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.900
be useful. There was some quite exciting things.

99
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.060
The New York times and the London times wrote little

100
00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:35.440
articles about it.

101
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.400
Never had my research in the popular press before.

102
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:45.310
And then it caused quite a sensation in Japan

103
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.460
and a museum in Japan included the version of the periodic table

104
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.020
in their display for the international year of the periodic table.

105
00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:57.820
And best of all,

106
00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.740
for the closing ceremony of the international year of the periodic table in

107
00:07:02.741 --> 00:07:06.160
Tokyo, a special fan was made.

108
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.620
You can see it here quite useful on the whole day and which

109
00:07:11.621 --> 00:07:14.530
has a upside down periodic table on it.

110
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.440
But the really important lesson for me

111
00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:26.890
was that you cannot really do anything very original

112
00:07:26.891 --> 00:07:28.780
with the periodic table.

113
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.130
And sometime after the people was published,

114
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:38.410
somebody pointed out to me that the English theoretical chemist

115
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.980
Christopher longer tigons had published a paper in

116
00:07:41.981 --> 00:07:46.660
1957 when I was nine years old, not quite 10,

117
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:51.730
and that never heard of the periodic table saying perhaps it would be

118
00:07:51.731 --> 00:07:56.290
better to have the periodic table the other way round for teaching the output

119
00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.360
principle. In the end,

120
00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:03.280
I got the fun of publishing a paper by got quite a solitary

121
00:08:03.281 --> 00:08:08.140
lesson that you cannot discover anything new about the

122
00:08:08.141 --> 00:08:09.370
periodic table,

123
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.890
except if you're Brady who invented the periodic

124
00:08:14.891 --> 00:08:18.430
table of videos, which I think really was originally.

125
00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:25.450
<v 2>If you've ever dreamed of having your name on the periodic table. Well,</v>

126
00:08:25.451 --> 00:08:27.310
I'm not sure there's much we can do to help you with that.

127
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.910
That's a very select club, some of the great names in science,

128
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:35.320
but what you can do is have your name on our periodic table of patrons,

129
00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:38.440
which looks like this. This is a slightly less exclusive,

130
00:08:38.441 --> 00:08:42.550
but equally important club of people that support our project on Patrion.

131
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.780
We update this table every month or two with names of people who've adopted

132
00:08:46.781 --> 00:08:47.614
elements,

133
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:52.870
Patrion supporters also receive occasional exclusive extras photos behind the

134
00:08:52.871 --> 00:08:54.640
scenes stuff. If you're interested,

135
00:08:54.641 --> 00:08:58.330
go to patrion.com/periodic videos,

136
00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.820
or have a look at the links I've put in the video description.

137
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:02.200
Thanks everyone for watching.

138
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:06.130
We'll be back again soon with more stories from the periodic table. That one,

139
00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:07.390
not the Patriot on one.
