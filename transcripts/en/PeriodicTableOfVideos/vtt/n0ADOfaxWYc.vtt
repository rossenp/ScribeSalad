00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.950
<v 0>This is quite a sad video because Harry Kroto a friend of mine</v>

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.560
and Nobel prize winner,

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.010
discoverer of [inaudible] the molecule shape,

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.040
like a soccer ball died quite recently.

5
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.270
He was also a very keen periodic videos fan,

6
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.500
but his Nobel prize is particularly special to me

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.080
because it is the only occasion in my scientific lifetime that

8
00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:32.970
I have really seen the project go right from the beginning to when they got

9
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:34.170
the Nobel prize.

10
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.030
Harry Kroto was a physical chemist who was really interested in the

11
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:41.490
molecules who find in outer space.

12
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.150
He was based at the university of Sussex in the South of England,

13
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.350
and he did a sorts of measurements, school microwave spectroscopy,

14
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.590
looking at chains of carbon atoms,

15
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.750
which he thought with the sorts of molecules that could be found in outer space.

16
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.490
And so much of his research was based on trying to synthesize

17
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.740
possible molecules that might also exist in space and

18
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.130
to do this and his key piece of work.

19
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.190
He went to rice university in Houston,

20
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.110
in the United States and worked with a chemist there called Rick Smalley.

21
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.330
And some years before I went to visit Rick's Morley as part of a

22
00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:26.460
big tour around the United States.

23
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.640
So I saw all the operators while it was being built.

24
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.420
This is my notebook from my trip here. It says,

25
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.040
Rick Smalley down here, you can see there is a sketch of the operators.

26
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.900
And the thing that I think is really interesting is that it says they're going

27
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.300
for large clusters,

28
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.900
which they called new surface science.

29
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.370
So this was the aim of the project 1982,

30
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.820
three years before they found [inaudible]

31
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.820
. This operators was designed to shine the laser on the road of a

32
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.653
 metal or solid carbon. And the pulse of the laser was so powerful that it produced a plume of vapor. And then down in this part of the operators, you can measure the mass of the molecules that came off.

33
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.650
The key experiment was that they sapped

34
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.200
carbon graphite and lots of fragments came off with different numbers

35
00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:29.250
of carbon atoms,

36
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.960
but one of them C 60 H was much more

37
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.580
abundant than everything else.

38
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.260
Eventually they worked out that it must be a molecule shaped like a

39
00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:41.880
football soccer ball.

40
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.460
[inaudible] he named it Buckminster fuller in after the famous

41
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.800
architect, Buckminster fuller,

42
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.130
who designed what is called the [inaudible] dome,

43
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.810
which is a dome that has part of this structure. You have to understand,

44
00:02:57.811 --> 00:03:02.710
they just saw some mass in the spectrum. They didn't have any chemical.

45
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.570
So there was a huge argument. Were they right? Were they not? Right?

46
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.350
People wrote quite rude papers. One of them had the title,

47
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.590
soccer ball deflated saying they were wrong,

48
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.860
but in the end it turned out they would correct.

49
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.740
And see 60.

50
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.900
The first new form of carbon that had been discovered for 2000

51
00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:28.420
years, turned out to be real.

52
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.940
See 60 itself. The material is a rather boring black color,

53
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.620
but when it's dissolved in solution, for example, in Tollerene,

54
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.160
it has rather a nice per-click red color.

55
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.570
Subsequently people discovered other molecules with slightly different

56
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:51.250
structures like CS 70, and which has a different color.

57
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.180
So you can see this one is more red and this one is more orange.

58
00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.280
Here was a form of carbon that you could get in solution. People thought,

59
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.550
perhaps you could do all sorts of exciting work,

60
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.440
perhaps make transistors, all sorts of things. The whole chemistry was open.

61
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.880
And since then there have been thousands and thousands of papers published. Now,

62
00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:17.620
what I think is the really important thing about Harry is what sort of person he

63
00:04:17.621 --> 00:04:21.490
was. There are lots of famous scientists in the world,

64
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.650
but he was a really passionate scientist and really

65
00:04:26.651 --> 00:04:31.630
keen on communicating science and how exciting science is to

66
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:32.464
young people.

67
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.150
He had quite a piercing voice and like me,

68
00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:38.950
he tended to wave his hands.

69
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.510
He was enormously enthusiastic when he lectured

70
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.020
whatever he was talking about. Not always very politely.

71
00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:51.340
If he didn't agree with something, he wasn't shy to say it was rubbish.

72
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.080
Last year, 2015,

73
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.090
there was an announcement that the iron of [inaudible] had been

74
00:04:58.091 --> 00:05:00.940
observed in outer space for Harry.

75
00:05:00.941 --> 00:05:03.970
This was the culmination of all his research.

76
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.200
He had been looking for these molecules because he thought they were in outer

77
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:12.880
space and they had been observed through the absorption of

78
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:17.170
light because obviously nobody has been with a test tube to

79
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.540
the atmosphere of styles. Harry came to Nottingham quite frequently.

80
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.310
One of his last official visits was to open a

81
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.690
nanotechnology center and to Mark the events,

82
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.620
he gave a lecture here and to Mark the opening,

83
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.660
the plaque was put on the wall of the nano center.

84
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.950
<v 1>[Inaudible] conveniently.</v>

85
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.780
<v 0>The manly technology center is just been refurbished and</v>

86
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:52.770
improved.

87
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.920
So the plaque is temporarily off the wall so we can show it to here.

88
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.080
And you can see it was opened nine year, nearly nine years ago.

89
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.930
And you can see his name.

90
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.990
So Harry Kroto and I'm sure he would like it.

91
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:11.930
If we bounced the molecule of C6 state of

92
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.340
the flack, Harry was also president of the Royal society of chemistry.

93
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.080
One of the duties of a precedent is to present prizes

94
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.440
and metals, the people who win prizes and metals.

95
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.300
And he was president when I and my industrial

96
00:06:32.301 --> 00:06:35.930
collaborators in the company called Thomas one, one,

97
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:40.940
the so-called industrial innovation team award down here

98
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.130
in sort of green ink is Harry's signature

99
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.950
as president of the Royal society of chemistry.

100
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:54.050
And there was a glass Rose bowl that was presented to me and is now at the

101
00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:58.760
company. But as soon as the official photograph had been taken,

102
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.480
Harry, who was quite jealous of my hair,

103
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.480
turn the bowl upside down and placed it on top of my head. Unfortunately,

104
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.100
nobody photographed that,

105
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.760
but we do have a nice picture of him presenting the award.

106
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.320
He was somebody who was not phased by ceremony

107
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.280
and tended to make fun of things like these formal ceremonies,

108
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.030
which is usually a good thing. Unfortunately,

109
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:31.190
some Nobel prize winners are quite pompous after they've got the

110
00:07:31.191 --> 00:07:35.210
prize because they suddenly think they're enormously great,

111
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.640
which of course they are great,

112
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.590
but the really great Nobel prize winners remain

113
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.600
pretty modest and they use their Nobel prize to

114
00:07:47.601 --> 00:07:52.070
enable them to speak out on important issues. In Harry's case,

115
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:57.050
he spoke out very strongly about the funding of

116
00:07:57.051 --> 00:08:00.110
science, the funding of fundamental science,

117
00:08:00.111 --> 00:08:04.580
rather than the applied science in a way that his Nobel prize

118
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:09.560
gave him the power to be listened to scientists are quite often

119
00:08:09.561 --> 00:08:13.580
asked what they might have done if they weren't scientists.

120
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:18.140
So there's no doubt in Harry's case that he would have been a graphic designer

121
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:22.910
who was very good at drawing and producing very nice designs.

122
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.560
One of Harry's more mischievous designs was a Bruce Shaw

123
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:32.150
advertising the chemistry tools at the university of Sussex.

124
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.700
It consisted of a map of the United Kingdom with a Bunsen

125
00:08:37.701 --> 00:08:42.350
burner on each of the cities where there was a chemistry

126
00:08:42.351 --> 00:08:44.720
department, which was okay.

127
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:49.760
But the thing that was mischievous is that only the Bunsen burner on Brighton

128
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:54.560
university of Sussex was a light and all the others were switched

129
00:08:54.561 --> 00:08:56.940
off. It's wonderfully fitting that Harry,

130
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.710
the potential graphic designer should have discovered a molecule

131
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:03.120
C6 day,

132
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.800
which probably has the most beautiful cemetery of any

133
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:11.790
molecule that's ever been discovered. I suppose,

134
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:16.290
if you had asked Harry when he was younger to design a really beautiful

135
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:18.840
molecule, he might have.

136
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.760
<v 2>Produce this mathematical friends.</v>

137
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.540
Does it have a special name? And the friend said, yes,

138
00:09:26.541 --> 00:09:27.830
it's called the soccer ball.
