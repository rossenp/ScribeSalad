00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.830
<v 0>We're going to do a very well-known experiment called the elephant's toothpaste.</v>

2
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.030
<v 1>We're using concentrated hydrogen peroxide. As you can see,</v>

3
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.710
I'm going to put some of that in all five liter Chronicle. Um,

4
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.630
and then I'll explain the rest as we go.

5
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.720
<v 0>There are lots of videos on YouTube of this already.</v>

6
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.460
So we thought we'd explain or trying to explain why it's so spectacular.

7
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.910
And of course, sprayed filmed it in slow motion,

8
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.040
which allows you to see quite a lot of the detail as the ranch and develops.

9
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.660
<v 1>The final ingredient to our reaction is a saturated solution of</v>

10
00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:39.950
potassium iodide. So this is what's going to make this reaction go.

11
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.330
So at this point, I think Neil,

12
00:00:41.331 --> 00:00:44.990
you need to move that way because I'm going to very rapidly be going that way as

13
00:00:44.991 --> 00:00:49.940
well. Once this has been added in, so are you ready? Three, two,

14
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:50.803
one.

15
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.660
<v 0>The reaction is a reaction of hydrogen peroxide.</v>

16
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.940
I've got rather a crude model here.

17
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.950
It is H2O to two hydrogens, two oxygens.

18
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.690
The key part about this molecule is that the bond between the two oxygens

19
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.240
is rather long and rather weak.

20
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.650
You may remember that when you break bones,

21
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.350
you have to put energy into a molecule.

22
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.190
And when you make bones, you get energy back.

23
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.380
The overall energy that you have from a reaction that's where the heat comes

24
00:01:33.381 --> 00:01:33.890
out,

25
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.420
or you have to put heat in depends on the balance between the

26
00:01:38.421 --> 00:01:42.470
energy needed to break the bones and the energy needed to make them.

27
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.820
So in this case,

28
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.980
the reaction is overall that two molecules of H2O

29
00:01:51.981 --> 00:01:56.960
to form two molecules of water and one molecule of

30
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.390
[inaudible] and Oh two oxygen has a double bond between the two

31
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.900
oxygen atoms. So if you look at it overall,

32
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.940
all you have done is to break two single bonds and make one double

33
00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:15.470
bond. Because in both of them, you have four O H bonds,

34
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.500
four here and four here. And usually,

35
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.180
and the key to this reaction is that two single bonds

36
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.850
need less energy to break them.

37
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.420
Then you get back when you form one double bond,

38
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.790
that is the double bond is more than twice as strong as two single bonds.

39
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.330
So you'll break into single bonds between oxygen atoms,

40
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.010
making one double bond between two oxygen atoms and getting energy

41
00:02:43.011 --> 00:02:46.490
out. And this is what makes the reaction work.

42
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.860
Now like most reactions,

43
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.990
you need some energy to get it started because hydrogen peroxide does not

44
00:02:56.991 --> 00:03:00.340
spontaneously fall apart at room temperature.

45
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.390
So in this reaction, in the demonstration,

46
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.830
you have hydrogen peroxide, a bit of soap to cause foam.

47
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.110
<v 1>Little bit of soap is just going into there. Yeah, just,</v>

48
00:03:13.111 --> 00:03:15.420
just washing up liquid liquid detergent.

49
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.810
<v 0>Sometimes people put in a bit of coloring,</v>

50
00:03:18.811 --> 00:03:21.030
so it looks a bit more dramatic the foam.

51
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.760
And then you have to drop in the catalyst,

52
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.860
which reduces the amount of energy needed to break the first few

53
00:03:28.861 --> 00:03:29.694
bones.

54
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.530
<v 1>The final ingredient to our reaction is a saturated solution of</v>

55
00:03:34.531 --> 00:03:35.850
potassium iodide.

56
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.740
<v 0>There's a choice of different catalysts.</v>

57
00:03:37.741 --> 00:03:41.340
You can use Sam used potassium iodide.

58
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.630
The potassium is not important. It's the iodide itself,

59
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.790
which can lower the energy needed to break the bond.

60
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.370
And because all molecules at room temperature have a certain

61
00:03:56.371 --> 00:03:59.310
amount of energy with the catalyst.

62
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.240
There is enough energy in the system to get the reaction started.

63
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.431
Now,

64
00:04:11.431 --> 00:04:16.290
once the reaction starts each molecule that reacts gives that

65
00:04:16.291 --> 00:04:21.270
some heat. So the temperature rises, chemical reactions go faster.

66
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.690
It's the temperature rise. So more molecules react,

67
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.710
more heat comes out and you get a runaway process.

68
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.070
So the reaction goes faster and faster and faster.

69
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.390
<v 1>So what he's doing now is actually using the oxygen of the foam to keep that</v>

70
00:04:39.391 --> 00:04:41.100
splint lit.

71
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.300
<v 0>If you look at the reaction products, oxygen is a gas.</v>

72
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.680
So you've got a liquid that is producing a gas,

73
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.110
which has a much bigger volume than the liquid.

74
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.190
And also because of the reaction mixtures heating up,

75
00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.500
you're also producing some steam. That's the vapor of water though.

76
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.220
The volume of steam is probably much less than the volume of the gas.

77
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.810
The material needs to expand because the gas is at room temperature.

78
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.430
So it expands. And by having soapy solution,

79
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.410
you can make a foam so people can actually see the gas expanding.

80
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.500
The reaction would work just as well without the soap,

81
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.200
but then you wouldn't see the oxygen coming out.

82
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.030
There is the second very important and totally physical

83
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.460
aspect of this reaction.

84
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.110
And that is that the reaction is done in a conical flask with sloping

85
00:05:37.111 --> 00:05:41.010
sides, two relatively small diameter neck.

86
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.940
And you will see the same thing in mode, any of the demonstrations on YouTube.

87
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.470
So what happens is that as the foam rises,

88
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.960
because the tube is getting narrow,

89
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.040
the speed at which it goes up has to accelerate.

90
00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.400
And so it comes out with really quite a high speed and shoots up into the

91
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:04.910
air. And of course, as you get the column of the foam going up,

92
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.190
there's nothing supporting it. So when it runs out of momentum,

93
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.110
gravity makes it collapse down again.

94
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.373
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

95
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:34.360
<v 0>I was really excited to see the foam overcoming a little</v>

96
00:06:34.361 --> 00:06:35.530
camera at the side.

97
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.180
So now we can actually demonstrate that

98
00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:45.490
this conical flask is important because Sam wanted to do the reaction in one of

99
00:06:45.491 --> 00:06:50.350
our big test tubes are barking dog tubes, which have straight sides.

100
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.660
She thought it'd be really spectacular.

101
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.910
Neil thought it would be a waste of time. In fact, they were both wrong.

102
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.830
It was not bad, but not nearly as dramatic as in a conical flask.

103
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.780
<v 2>Wow. All right. You're right. You were right.</v>

104
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.740
<v 0>The takeaway message of this demonstration is that the</v>

105
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:40.570
underlying chemistry provides the energy to get the reaction

106
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.140
going, but you need the catalyst to set it off.

107
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:50.020
And then the buildup of heat and the conical flask gets it

108
00:07:50.021 --> 00:07:51.400
to go with the real whoosh.

109
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:58.450
So next time when you see the elephant's toothpaste, think of the science,

110
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.880
not the clowning of the people who are doing it.

111
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:05.200
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>
