WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.740
<v 0>Today, we're going to learn a little bit about, uh, this molecule here,</v>

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.610
this crazy complex looking piece of molecular architecture,

3
00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:11.670
which is called strychnine, which no doubt you probably will have heard of.

4
00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:16.020
It's a well-known poison these days it's used for killing rats,

5
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.920
but in the past it was a medicinal compound, especially in the Victorian area.

6
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.630
So at that point in time, uh, it was used for all sorts of ailments,

7
00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:25.770
like headaches. It was, uh,

8
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.580
one of the very first athletic performance enhancers, believe it or not.

9
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.720
And of course it's,

10
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.040
it's a poison it's really not useful in any of these respects whatsoever.

11
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.780
It comes from the seeds of a tree in the Philippines. And,

12
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.070
uh, hundreds of years, the Filipinos would use the extracts of this.

13
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.220
So being as they called the seed to treat various elements.

14
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:50.850
So it was a sort of herbal type of medicine and it works on the nervous system.

15
00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:55.070
So it give you a bit of a tingle, um, obviously in high doses or,

16
00:00:55.071 --> 00:00:57.210
or actually not that high doses, um,

17
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.160
it'll have very severe effects on you, but if, if something, he takes something,

18
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.090
it interacts in your body,

19
00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:06.720
you get a bit of a tingle and perhaps you feel like it's doing good rather than

20
00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:11.490
harm. So in small quantities, uh, it was used for centuries,

21
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:14.280
but actually is it's got no real beneficial effect, uh,

22
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.170
as a medicine and indeed, you know, famously it's been used, uh,

23
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.020
in all sorts of murder mystery cases.

24
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.650
<v 1>I have just one story about straightening,</v>

25
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.540
but I really like it just before I started as a PhD

26
00:01:29.541 --> 00:01:30.410
student,

27
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.210
a Brazilian professor visiting the chemistry department,

28
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.370
took some strict Nene out to the store because he wanted to poison his

29
00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:42.890
wife, but being a professor,

30
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.600
he was a bit types and minded and he mislaid the threatening. He lost it.

31
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.490
And he got really worried that somebody might get poisoned

32
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.380
other than his wife.

33
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.580
So he went to the police and admitted everything.

34
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.160
And then the strict Nene was found in his jacket pocket hanging in his

35
00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:07.460
wardrobe. So his wife was safe.

36
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.940
What happened to the professor? I have no idea.

37
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.380
<v 0>I find as a Stanford university is poisoned by strict being murdered by</v>

38
00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:16.041
straightening. And the,

39
00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:20.810
her last words were that this is the most horrible and painful death

40
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:22.281
and fiction.

41
00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:26.660
It's been used a lot and I get the Christie three or four novels of hers had

42
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.010
strict coming in in the grand Budapest hotel. It's in there as a, as a poison.

43
00:02:31.011 --> 00:02:31.730
Actually,

44
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.660
there hasn't been many deaths or murders through the use of strict strychnine.

45
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.760
Uh, luckily, so this was given to us by Sigma Aldrich, uh, for the use in,

46
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.030
uh, the periodic videos. So thank you very much to them. Yeah.

47
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.740
It was about a gram in here and it takes about 10 to 50 milligrams to,

48
00:02:48.741 --> 00:02:52.760
to kill human beings. This tree gives a beautiful white flowers, uh,

49
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.860
very fragrant smelling. Um,

50
00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:58.760
but presumably it's in there to stop animals from eating the seeds, you know,

51
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.350
animal takes a bite of it and doesn't finish its meal.

52
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.440
Like many of the campaigns that I talk about it works on the nervous system

53
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.340
means that you or your muscles go out of control. And you know,

54
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:11.590
you dive as fixation of, uh,

55
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.290
not being able to breathe because your lungs aren't working properly.

56
00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.700
Imagine it is a series of electrical cables with junction boxes in between.

57
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.390
And at the end is he got sensors and muscles at the other end.

58
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:24.670
So sensors built up using irons,

59
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.290
a concentration of positive charge using generally sodium potassium,

60
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.090
calcium mines that then finds an electrical charge down the cable to the other

61
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:38.770
end and then calcium mines allowing the release of neurotransmitters to go and

62
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:42.370
tell the muscle or the brain or whatever's on the other end, what to do.

63
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.160
So this interferes with that process at the junction boxes.

64
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.990
So this inhibits both sodium and chlorine iron channels, which is unusual.

65
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.900
Normally a molecule will interact with just one type of receptor.

66
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.230
Whereas this is interacts with two types of receptor.

67
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.660
How does it actually get there? Yeah, that's a good question.

68
00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:03.070
So if you ingest something, it'll go obviously into your gut.

69
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:03.904
Once it's in the gut,

70
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.590
it can then pass through the guts of blood barrier needs to be charged to do

71
00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:10.270
that. So we've got basic aiming on here.

72
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.240
It then gets into your bloodstream in the bloodstream,

73
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:14.950
then transports it around your body.

74
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.660
This obviously with the blood will go to all your muscles and start to interfere

75
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.440
with any, uh, neuromuscular junctions that, that it comes across.

76
00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:26.590
It's not a very good murder weapon because it will stay in the body for years

77
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.500
traces of it. So it'd be very easily identifiable.

78
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.230
<v 2>No, it's a new one. Just strictly tastes like, well,</v>

79
00:04:40.231 --> 00:04:45.060
they say it takes bitten. And, uh, on the strict name, uh,

80
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.650
this is tertiary aiming here. This, this blue action, uh,

81
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.130
in anything with a tertiary aiming, always tastes incredibly better. A lot,

82
00:04:53.131 --> 00:04:58.110
a lot of insects are these tertiary Amy molecules on

83
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.450
the back so that they taste horrible.

84
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.160
So a bit like I'm licking a brass or copper spoon. Yeah. Really bitter and

85
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.300
really not very pleasant at all. So again, not,

86
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.600
not the best poison cause you get to taste it in your cup of tea.

87
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.820
Here we are. We'll open the bank, the, uh,

88
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.550
high security containment system and just take a little look at what the

89
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.810
straightening looks like so that we have the chop.

90
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.730
There's not a lot in here. Actually. I was maybe it maybe a hundred milligrams.

91
00:05:32.731 --> 00:05:36.030
No, not at all. Let's just take that.

92
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.880
There we go. So there we go.

93
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.850
Just a, a white

94
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.110
powder essentially looks fairly innocuous.

95
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.580
I mean the majority of chemicals that you work with are not toxic. Uh,

96
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.490
there may be, it was so-called harmful,

97
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.500
maybe slightly crazy for majority. Uh, uh, not that way.

98
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.420
So I wouldn't want my PhD students to it with anything that's extremely

99
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:07.010
toxic. Um,

100
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.140
although we have made a few natural products over the years, which,

101
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.700
which are really quite potent,

102
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.380
but this is quite dangerous substance and not something that the likes of which

103
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:19.090
we would normally.

104
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.670
<v 0>Be working with. I look at that and I think, wow, that's beautiful,</v>

105
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.920
such a really unique architecture. All of these rings systems,

106
00:06:26.921 --> 00:06:30.940
you've got hydrogens pointing into this cavity here.

107
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.020
Seven membered rings, five of them had rings.

108
00:06:34.021 --> 00:06:38.680
Six members rings all sorts of different molecular architectural pieces in

109
00:06:38.681 --> 00:06:43.180
there. And for the synthetic chemists that makes this an absolutely outstanding

110
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.650
challenge. This is the Everest,

111
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.040
if you like of the total synthesis type of world.

112
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.260
So as isolated by two French chemists in 1818.

113
00:06:53.261 --> 00:06:56.890
So, you know, nearly 200 years ago now, uh,

114
00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:01.510
and it was about 120 years later by the time chemists had

115
00:07:01.511 --> 00:07:01.991
figured,

116
00:07:01.991 --> 00:07:06.910
finally figured out what on earth the structure was because it's just so

117
00:07:06.911 --> 00:07:10.000
complex. So there were over a hundred,

118
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.740
250 papers attempting to find out what the structure of

119
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.290
straightening was. And eventually in 1947, uh, two chemists, uh,

120
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:24.970
Robert Robinson who is later became sir Robert Robinson at Oxford university.

121
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.940
He proposed the correct structure and, uh,

122
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.180
Luke's a completely separate chemist. Also debit.

123
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.830
Rob Robinson was very famous in his day and this was a combination of two

124
00:07:35.831 --> 00:07:39.400
decades worth of work in his laboratories. Seven years later,

125
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.230
Robert Burns Woodward was the first group to synthesize it. And,

126
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.800
uh, Robin Hanson had said for its molecular size,

127
00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:52.540
it's the most complex molecule ever known since Woodward's original synthesis

128
00:07:52.541 --> 00:07:55.150
has been 17 further syntheses.

129
00:07:55.180 --> 00:08:00.010
So 1954 was the first synthesis as was around 28 synthetic steps.

130
00:08:00.011 --> 00:08:04.840
So different things that you had to do and the yield was minuscule. It was, uh,

131
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:09.680
there was starting from tens of kilos and getting milligrams, Oh, Oh,

132
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.230
Oh, Oh 6% yield, which is a very small amount.

133
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.030
And quite a lot of steps.

134
00:08:16.031 --> 00:08:20.740
28 steps actually is for the complexity of this molecule is still quite

135
00:08:20.741 --> 00:08:25.330
competitive. The next synthesis was carried out in 1992.

136
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:30.010
So it was many years later, uh, by Phillip Magnus. That was again 28 steps,

137
00:08:30.011 --> 00:08:34.720
but he got up to point over 3% yield. It's considerably more efficient,

138
00:08:34.721 --> 00:08:39.040
about a thousand times more efficient, but still a very low yield in each case.

139
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:44.260
Um, all of these people, uh, were developing a new type of bond connection,

140
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:49.060
connecting reaction, and they are putting that into operation. So Magnus in,

141
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:53.770
in his synthesis was making this bond in this bond and the key step using a

142
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:58.020
deals, all the type of, uh, Woodward had used a, um,

143
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.130
obviously that the synthetic chemistry of the day in, in, you know,

144
00:09:02.131 --> 00:09:05.850
40 years have passed by the time Magnus, uh,

145
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:10.680
came to doing it in 1994 was the next synthesis.

146
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.450
And that one went up to 3% yield using Larry omens chemistry.

147
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.670
And these are all, you know, incredible.

148
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:21.840
These are the rock stars of the organic chemistry world that are coming to play

149
00:09:21.841 --> 00:09:23.910
here. Uh, so, uh,

150
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:28.710
time moves on 2007 Padre. I've got it down to 16 steps,

151
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.050
2% yield by 2011,

152
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:36.000
we had the shortest census ever nine steps by Chris van Duval, terrible yield.

153
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.040
There was one really difficult step in there,

154
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.120
but nine steps when you think the original was 28, um,

155
00:09:42.121 --> 00:09:45.990
it was quite incredible and probably the best synthesis out there is by David

156
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.330
McMillan, 12 steps, but 6% yield.

157
00:09:48.331 --> 00:09:53.100
So considerably stronger and thousand times more efficient than the original

158
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:53.880
synthesis.

159
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.620
And this is the progress that organic chemistry has made not only in structural

160
00:09:58.621 --> 00:09:59.341
elucidation.

161
00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:03.990
So 20 years worth of work in the 1930s and forties,

162
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:08.400
250 papers to determine the structure of this

163
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:09.750
today.

164
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:14.250
One of my PhD students will be able to determine the structure in an afternoon

165
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:19.170
because spectroscopic techniques have come an incredibly long way.

166
00:10:19.171 --> 00:10:23.070
There were almost none back in 1946, we had infrared,

167
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.700
there was an x-ray of this in 1952.

168
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.020
So that was one of the very first x-rays, but in 1946, that didn't exist.

169
00:10:31.021 --> 00:10:35.910
So back then they had to literally chemically react it and figure

170
00:10:35.911 --> 00:10:37.080
out what, uh,

171
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:41.490
bonds would have been broken through that type of reaction.

172
00:10:41.491 --> 00:10:46.230
So it was a real detective story back when using evidence chemical evidence to

173
00:10:46.231 --> 00:10:48.960
determine structure. Whereas now we can use spectroscopy.

174
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.570
<v 2>Can I happen to that now? Well,</v>

175
00:10:50.571 --> 00:10:54.770
I'll put some of that back in the bottle and the rest we'll have we'll destroy

176
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:59.120
and then sit on a shelf for a certain lot cupboard. Yeah.

177
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:03.500
Just in case we get some ramps in the, uh, the lab.

178
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.260
<v 0>Uh, but every few seconds, your brain's saying, breathe in, breathe out,</v>

179
00:11:09.261 --> 00:11:13.340
breathe in, breathe out. It does it automatically, or, or move your muscles.

180
00:11:13.341 --> 00:11:17.540
So if you stop any of those signals, then obviously it muscles stop.

181
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.390
And if you stop breathing, you're going to die pretty quick.
