00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.170
<v 0>This is a classic demonstration,</v>

2
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.390
which involves what I would call a pickled Gherkin.

3
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.550
Many of you might just call a pickle.

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.290
The demonstration involves taking two electrically

5
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.090
conducting pieces of metal forks and sticking

6
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:24.270
them into each end of the goat kin,

7
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.530
and then applying a high voltage across it.

8
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.270
Now I must say immediately,

9
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.860
this is potentially an extremely dangerous experiment. And one,

10
00:00:34.861 --> 00:00:38.580
you shouldn't try because if you touch the metal,

11
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.110
you will get a huge shock. Neil had a historic piece of operators,

12
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.490
which we used.

13
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.080
Unfortunately the plastic safety cover had been lost,

14
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.670
but because we were using it under controlled conditions, it was safe.

15
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.880
I found the piece of equipment about to be thrown out.

16
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.080
And I wrote a note to Neil saying, save it for periodic videos.

17
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.800
Probably we should go straight to watching what.

18
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.893
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

19
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.950
<v 0>The first thing to realize is that when you pickle something,</v>

20
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.190
you put it into a mixture of salt and vinegar.

21
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.140
So contains ions, sodium ions, chloride ions.

22
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.310
And so solution is electrically conducting,

23
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.540
but it's not very electrically conducting compared to metal.

24
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.220
So what you've got are two electrical conductors with a

25
00:01:40.221 --> 00:01:44.150
resistance in between. And when you pass a current through it,

26
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.360
the resistor will hit heat up

27
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.560
To have here.

28
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.090
And you have to understand that Gherkin is a biological

29
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.810
specimen and biological specimens are different.

30
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.130
So it's not like doing a chemical experiment where the chemicals should be

31
00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:06.380
exactly reproducible. As you can see,

32
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.820
this Gherkin is completely different from the other ones, not even as long.

33
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.650
So you can't expect everything to be totally reproducible.

34
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.490
What happens is that when you switch on the current to begin with you see

35
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.610
nothing and then, uh, one of the ends,

36
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.260
and it's important that it's at the end because the maximum resistance

37
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.240
appears to be where the fork goes into the Gherkin because

38
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.100
there's less opportunity for the electricity to be conducted that

39
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.090
heats up.

40
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.980
And it heats up enough for the sodium mines to give out light in the

41
00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:52.850
same way that you may have seen from sodium street lens. Now,

42
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.830
what is interesting is because mains electricity in most

43
00:02:57.831 --> 00:03:01.210
countries is so-called alternating current,

44
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.980
that it switches from positive to negative, positive to negative.

45
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.990
So the polarity switches round going through zero in

46
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:14.590
the UK, it's at 50 times a second in the States.

47
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:16.390
It's 60 times a second.

48
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.560
And if you watch the Gherkin under high speed,

49
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.460
you can see that the light flashes on and off

50
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.080
as the current changes. So if you think about the voltage,

51
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.340
this side is the so-called neutral, which stays at zero volts.

52
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.200
And this side goes up and down to plus

53
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.640
200 volts down, minus 200 volts up and down.

54
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.830
And the first time we saw it,

55
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.330
there was a strong glow from the neutral end.

56
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.750
And we spent quite a lot of time thinking,

57
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.980
why should it be the neutral land rather than why the voltage is changing?

58
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.090
So in the end we thought, we'd just try it again. And the next go,

59
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.390
can it went at the other end? So it's clearly chance

60
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.160
If you look at the pool goat in afterwards, it's a bit shriveled.

61
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.350
And the end where the light came out is child.

62
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.950
We've actually got hot enough to burn the Go-Team.

63
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.960
You may know of what temperature gherkins burn, but we didn't.

64
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.800
So we decided to use a thermal imaging camera.

65
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.970
The first thing that I noticed is you can see the steam coming out of the

66
00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.130
Gherkin because the steam is hot and therefore is picked up by the camera.

67
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.660
Whereas our camera barely noticed it in the dark.

68
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.980
You can see that it really is heating up and you can see that the end where the

69
00:05:10.981 --> 00:05:15.030
light is coming from gets much hotter than the other end.

70
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.070
We then thought that it would be interesting to try and increase the resistance

71
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.690
of the middle of the Gherkin.

72
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.570
So Neil cut out a piece from the middle of the Gherkin length.

73
00:05:26.571 --> 00:05:31.500
This a hypothesis was that if we made the can narrow

74
00:05:31.501 --> 00:05:35.820
at that point, that part of the Gherkin should get hotter because it's thinner.

75
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.620
It will conduct electricity less well. So it has higher resistance.

76
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.810
And the heating effect is related to both the current and the

77
00:05:45.811 --> 00:05:50.700
resistance and the current going through the homework and must be the same,

78
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.080
but the current density will be higher in the small point and it will get

79
00:05:55.081 --> 00:05:55.914
hotter.

80
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.200
And in fact, what we found when we looked with the thermal imaging camera,

81
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.980
indeed, it did get very hot there. Interestingly, even when,

82
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.600
when Neil had cut it,

83
00:06:19.601 --> 00:06:23.680
it didn't get hot enough to give any emission from the sodium.

84
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.090
But you may remember we got quite excited why it went to one end rather than the

85
00:06:28.091 --> 00:06:32.320
other. And quite by chance in this experiment,

86
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.090
what happened was that one end lit up. And then after a bit,

87
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.960
the other end lit up for a few moments,

88
00:06:40.961 --> 00:06:44.560
both were blowing and then it went to the other end

89
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:52.570
And you can see really well with the thermal imaging camera that the

90
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.800
forks themselves,

91
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.570
the prongs of the forks get very hot because they're conducting

92
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.670
away the heat from this whole zone.

93
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.880
I have no idea why it changed from one end to the other.

94
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.833
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

95
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.200
<v 0>I'm not an expert on Gherkin structure. And anyway,</v>

96
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.240
it's probably pure chance,

97
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.910
but you'd have to do lots and lots more good things to be sure when

98
00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:28.660
you look at these experiments and you can see there are videos of this on

99
00:07:28.661 --> 00:07:29.494
YouTube,

100
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.970
you should always think what is the science behind it?

101
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.220
They're great demonstrations,

102
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:41.020
but so often they're wasted people just take it as a joke and don't

103
00:07:41.021 --> 00:07:43.870
think about the physics or the chemistry behind it.

104
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.153
Okay.

105
00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.610
<v 1>Thanks for watching periodic videos.</v>

We really appreciate people that do that. It's a lot of fun.

109
00:08:14.051 --> 00:08:16.180
You can even adopt an element if you like,

110
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.660
but of course the best thing you can do is do what you're doing right now.

111
