00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.760
<v 0>Most chemists are fascinated by what they've always been told that</v>

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.770
HF hydrofluoric acid eats human flesh.

3
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.040
We thought that we should, right.

4
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.350
Obviously we can't try human flesh.

5
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.720
And Brady decided that the chicken's leg that's an

6
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.310
uncooked leg from a dead chicken is a reasonable

7
00:00:31.311 --> 00:00:33.950
approximation to a finger.

8
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.690
We decided that we should try and do a demonstration,

9
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.660
but with some controls so we could compare them.

10
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.580
And what we wanted to know was what was special about HF?

11
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.120
Was it the acid or was it the fluorine?

12
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.430
So we thought if we took two other acids, HCL, hydrogen chloride,

13
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.200
and so Furic acid,

14
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.950
both of those have the H the acid part,

15
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.540
but they don't have the fluorine.

16
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.400
I had been told that HF attacked your

17
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.610
nerves so quickly that if you stuck your finger in it,

18
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.130
and none of us obviously would try this,

19
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.500
that it destroyed the nerves really quickly. So you could hardly feel anything.

20
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.190
There are stories of people whose gloves have leaked,

21
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.930
and they've taken out their hands and bits are missing. And of course,

22
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.750
HIF features in the TV show, breaking bad, which I'm glad to say.

23
00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:33.110
I've never.

24
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.250
<v 1>Seen, are you glad to say that it's really good? Well.</v>

25
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.790
<v 0>Perhaps perhaps one day I might watch it when I'm old,</v>

26
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.430
after five minutes, nothing

27
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.530
after half an hour, nothing.

28
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.883
It's just half an hour

29
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.070
at the end of the day, something's likely my truth,

30
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.113
how

31
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.770
we decided to call it today,

32
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.630
but just in case to leave it overnight in the acid in the

33
00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:35.270
morning, it was really nice. Interesting.

34
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.900
The two chicken legs in the control acids,

35
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.880
HCL sulfuric acid had made quite strong color in the

36
00:02:46.881 --> 00:02:51.110
liquid and the bits of the chicken legs sticking out,

37
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.040
still looked quite healthy. You could almost imagine cooking them,

38
00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.070
but the leg in the HF was pale. Look,

39
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:01.360
decidedly dead.

40
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.100
So we lifted them out. The ones in ACL and sulfuric acid.

41
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.050
It turned rather jelly lines.

42
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.223
<v 2>She's done.</v>

43
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.350
[inaudible].

44
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.210
<v 0>Really looked almost like an advertisement for being a vegetarian,</v>

45
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.590
really yucky, but with the HF,

46
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.880
it was quite different.

47
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.290
It was as if the surgeon had chopped the bottom off,

48
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.120
it was moderately interesting what has happened below the surface,

49
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.310
but really what was much more interesting to me is why the

50
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.150
chicken leg in HF looked as if it was dead.

51
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.370
And clearly what had happened is that some of the pigments,

52
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.270
some of the red color of the meat had been bleached away.

53
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.460
The reason that meat is red is because it contains

54
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.320
a molecule called myoglobin. This is related to hemoglobin,

55
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.770
which we have in our blood and my globin stores,

56
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.500
oxygen in the muscles.

57
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.900
And my globin is a very similar color to hemoglobin.

58
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.920
If you cook beef roast beef.

59
00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:38.820
So it's rare and red juice comes out. The red juice is my globin.

60
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.010
When in fact it's my globin, that's reactive with carbon monoxide,

61
00:04:44.011 --> 00:04:45.630
which makes it such bright red.

62
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.070
My theory is that the HF

63
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.980
is bleaching away.

64
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.880
That's attacking the structure of the myoglobin in particular,

65
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.320
the so-called hymn group,

66
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.300
the iron porphyrin group in the middle and breaking some of the bonds

67
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.390
so that it no longer absorbs light and is colorless.

68
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.120
And that's why the solution that was left of HF was completely

69
00:05:12.121 --> 00:05:15.330
colorless. It looked as if the stuff had just disappeared.

70
00:05:15.331 --> 00:05:18.570
There wasn't any sludge in the HF peaker.

71
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.210
<v 1>From school, I thought acid was acid.</v>

72
00:05:21.211 --> 00:05:24.990
And we always learned that H plus is the big deal here and doing all the work,

73
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.400
whether the H plus is coming from hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid or

74
00:05:29.401 --> 00:05:31.710
hydrofluoric acid, why did they,

75
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.260
why did the three or will do their work so differently?

76
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.900
<v 0>The reason is that the chicken leg is made up of a</v>

77
00:05:39.901 --> 00:05:43.470
mixture of organic compounds, proteins,

78
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.280
a bit of fat and also bone,

79
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.860
which is a mixture of mineral. Now,

80
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.450
if you break these organic molecules, you are breaking carbon,

81
00:05:54.451 --> 00:05:56.820
hydrogen, carbon, carbon bonds,

82
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.130
and you can't just break them. You have to,

83
00:06:01.131 --> 00:06:05.690
if you like cap them off with some other group and

84
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.790
carbon fluorine bonds of very strong. In fact,

85
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.660
H F is not a very strong acid.

86
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.250
If you dissolve HF in water, especially when it's dilute,

87
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.290
it is not as acid as HCL because the bond

88
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.980
doesn't dissociate the HF bond quite so much,

89
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.350
but hydrogen fluoride HF is very reactive because although

90
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:38.300
the bond is strong, the bonds in the products that you make are even stronger.

91
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.770
So.

92
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.370
<v 1>In terms of HF, having a reputation for being a bad boy,</v>

93
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.970
that's really got nothing to do with its acidity or its hydrogen.

94
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.650
It's just the fact that it's got fluorine.

95
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:53.080
<v 0>It is because it has got fluorine and it will react very</v>

96
00:06:53.081 --> 00:06:53.914
easily.

97
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.040
<v 1>So anything with fluorine? No, because.</v>

98
00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.490
<v 0>If you take something with say, carbon fluorine bonds,</v>

99
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:05.590
the bonds are so strong that it's very difficult to break them.

100
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.240
They are very inert. They used this refrigerants, for example,

101
00:07:10.241 --> 00:07:12.880
because they're very stable.

102
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.500
<v 1>So it's, so it's a bit like fluorine has come to the dance with hydrogen,</v>

103
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.380
but really it wants to dance with someone else precisely.

104
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.550
<v 0>Well, it was not so much to dance, but to bond for life.</v>

105
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:31.600
The reason why I think my explanation is correct is because

106
00:07:31.601 --> 00:07:33.790
we then went the whole hog,

107
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:39.160
cut the strings and dunked the chicken legs completely in the

108
00:07:39.161 --> 00:07:39.700
acid.
