00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.860
<v 0>What is the most embarrassing thing that you have messed up in the lab or taken?</v>

2
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.020
<v 1>I think my biggest mistake was an undergraduate.</v>

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.630
When I tried to open a vacuum Desecrator large

4
00:00:14.631 --> 00:00:16.970
glass vessel with a flat glass lid,

5
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.090
the lid was stuck and it had a tap at the top.

6
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.820
And I decided to open this with compressed air. So I attached, compressed that,

7
00:00:24.821 --> 00:00:29.810
switched it on and it worked beautifully. The lid shut up with a loud bang,

8
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.970
but what I didn't realize beforehand, but once the lid got to here,

9
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.130
there was nothing to support it.

10
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.060
So it came down with a huge crash and smashed to bits.

11
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.430
I could have been killed.

12
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.020
<v 0>On periodic videos. What is your favorite video so far?</v>

13
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.990
<v 1>I'm a scientist not to journalist once a</v>

14
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.340
journalist, not Brady said that for a journalist.

15
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.840
The favorite story is the one they're working on at the moment.

16
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.070
And once they've done it, it sort of fades into the background.

17
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.960
So it's a bit like that for me. I hope every video when we make it,

18
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.370
it's going to be one of the best.

19
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.260
I think the single video that I think is funniest and which

20
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:19.690
amuses me most of the time,

21
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.560
I still like is our original video about Hasidim where

22
00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:28.670
at the beginning I say, I mean, nothing about,

23
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.900
should we make something happen? I still like that video quite a lot.

24
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.700
<v 0>Do you think what molecule you have dealt with that has the most different</v>

25
00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:38.534
elements in it?

26
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.160
<v 1>I always worked with quite small molecules.</v>

27
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.330
I think there's some organic molecule with selenium in it.

28
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.730
I can't even remember the name. It was yellow.

29
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.870
And I think that had quite a lot of different elements in it,

30
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.290
but quite honestly,

31
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.980
chemists don't count the number of elements in the molecules.

32
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.600
You tend to look at just one or two atoms near the center where the is going to

33
00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:09.980
happen. And the rest is rather light my hair. You're aware about it,

34
00:02:09.981 --> 00:02:13.400
but you ignore it sometimes chemists different, just call it shrubbery.

35
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.560
That's like bushes.

36
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.700
And so you've never count the number of atoms,

37
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.120
but now you've asked probably I'll start nightly counting. Atoms.

38
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.190
What is your favorite element?

39
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.950
This is a question I've been asked several times and I have quite a few

40
00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:35.420
elements that I get quite excited about. There's Xenon,

41
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.250
which has been good to me, iron,

42
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.030
which I've studied the photochemistry of this for a lot.

43
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.460
I liked the element sodium because it's symbol and a

44
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.070
is what my mother called herself as a little girl. She was called inner.

45
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.560
So she abbreviated it to now.

46
00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:57.980
So I get a nice warm feeling whenever I see the symbol,

47
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.140
I suppose at moment, I'm really excited about the element niobium.

48
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.550
I've done very little research with niobium, but this morning,

49
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:11.470
a PhD students started in my research group and she's going to be

50
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.100
studying chemistry of niobium. So I'm really excited about that.

51
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.290
<v 0>What molecule do you think is most interesting at the moment?</v>

52
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.640
<v 1>I think huge number of molecules are interesting.</v>

53
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.800
Carbon dioxide is very interesting because how are we going to deal with so

54
00:03:28.801 --> 00:03:32.640
much carbon dioxide in the world that we're making by burning fuels?

55
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.690
But molecule I think is particularly interesting is nitric oxide,

56
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.760
the L the compound and O which is very

57
00:03:41.761 --> 00:03:43.770
reactive. If you expose it to air,

58
00:03:43.771 --> 00:03:48.480
it reacts with oxygen making clouds of [inaudible] almost

59
00:03:48.481 --> 00:03:52.590
instantaneously, but what's really intriguing about this molecule.

60
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.610
Is that quite recently, and by quite recently,

61
00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:58.530
I mean the last 25 years,

62
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.600
it was certainly discovered that this tiny molecule Eno is absolutely

63
00:04:03.601 --> 00:04:08.340
vital in the function of organisms, particularly ourselves,

64
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.210
because if Ana is released in the bloodstream,

65
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.630
it causes the blood vessels to expand.

66
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.850
And so I've always thought it's extraordinary that this molecule,

67
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.620
that was just the chemical curiosity's suddenly been found to be

68
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.850
really important in controlling the physiology of our body.

69
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.650
<v 0>What advice would you give to young students hoping to study chemistry in the</v>

70
00:04:34.651 --> 00:04:35.484
future?

71
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.480
<v 1>That's quite simple.</v>

72
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.300
Enjoy yourself and learn as much chemistry as you can.

73
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.900
You never know which bits are going to be useful. Of course,

74
00:04:45.901 --> 00:04:48.120
a lot of it is always going to be useless,

75
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.350
but it's really that you need to know as much as you can.

76
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.510
One of the really good pieces of advice I was given by one of my friends,

77
00:04:57.511 --> 00:05:01.710
who's a bit older than me. He said that you've got to imagine chemistry,

78
00:05:01.711 --> 00:05:06.090
rather like a landscape. If you're walking with Hills and so on.

79
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.510
And if you want to be really good chemist,

80
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.210
you need to know about the shape of the landscape.

81
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.790
You don't need to know every detail and so on,

82
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.080
but you need to know the rough shape of the landscape so that you know which

83
00:05:19.081 --> 00:05:20.580
direction to go in.

84
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.840
If you want to get to a particular place and therefore the more you can explore

85
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.030
chemistry, the better, how many.

86
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.010
<v 0>Water bottles are in your collection.</v>

87
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:30.780
<v 1>I'm not sure,</v>

88
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.920
but I think it's over 300 and occasionally

89
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.530
boring. One falls down and it gets thrown out.

90
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.090
Sometimes I get a really exciting one and I have to persuade my secretary that

91
00:05:45.091 --> 00:05:48.630
we can add it. I've just been to Senegal in Africa.

92
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.550
I brought two bottles back, but I haven't yet dead bring it into the office.

93
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.490
But I think that plastic water bottles are really quite beautiful.

94
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.060
And if they were really expensive, I think people would quite value them.

95
00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.260
<v 0>No, you go run for those who haven't seen it.</v>

96
00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.470
That's just some of the collection. Are you proud of it?

97
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.840
<v 1>Yes. Sometimes I'm slightly embarrassed, but it's quite fun.</v>

98
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.520
It's ruined my life. Every time somebody gives me a bottle of water.

99
00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.540
I start looking at it like a bottle of wine. And so on.

100
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.280
I've even just recently written a scientific paper about two of the boat,

101
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.770
water bottles in this collection.

102
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.530
<v 0>Oh, that sounds like a video for another day.</v>

103
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.450
<v 1>Brady and I, and the rest of the periodic video team,</v>

104
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.100
I've got really quite excited because we've reached our 500th video.

105
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.240
When we started out, we were just going to make a periodic table,

106
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.250
119 videos with an introduction and an advert hundred and

107
00:06:51.251 --> 00:06:52.084
20 and two.

108
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.890
And we never dreamed that we'd be gone for so long with so many videos.

109
00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.560
And first of all,

110
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.760
I really like to thank all of you who watch our videos,

111
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.230
who send us comments,

112
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.120
who even stopped me or some of my colleagues in the street and tell us how much

113
00:07:10.121 --> 00:07:11.800
you enjoy the videos,

114
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.550
because this is a great reward to us to hear from you.

115
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.920
But I'd also like to say that we shouldn't just be looking back,

116
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.560
looking at what we've done in the past,

117
00:07:23.561 --> 00:07:25.960
because science is always moving forwards.

118
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:31.150
And I'm really excited about what we can do in the next 500

119
00:07:31.151 --> 00:07:34.960
videos. We've only touched on the number of molecules.

120
00:07:34.961 --> 00:07:39.400
There are there all sorts of molecules, which are crying out for videos,

121
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:40.420
ammonia.

122
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.680
Some of the element videos are not very good need to be redone.

123
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.960
We have a high-speed camera now,

124
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.520
so we can show you things which none of us have seen

125
00:07:51.521 --> 00:07:52.354
before.

126
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.400
And we really want to keep you thinking about

127
00:07:57.401 --> 00:08:02.260
chemistry and understanding chemically more of what's going on around you in

128
00:08:02.261 --> 00:08:03.220
everyday life.

129
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.750
So I hope you'll keep watching and I look forward to talking to you all and

130
00:08:07.751 --> 00:08:11.740
perhaps many more people as well. When we reach our thousandth video,

131
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.053
won't belong.

132
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:14.283
<v 0>Oh, say,</v>

133
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:19.000
I will say thank you to professor Poliakoff who does so much for these videos

134
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:24.040
and lots of people write comments saying you seem very kind and very wise and

135
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.590
like a nice guy and, and you are,

136
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.760
and also those people should know when the camera's off professor Poliakoff is

137
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:34.590
even kinder and nicer. So we're very lucky to have him. Thank you. Thank you.

138
00:08:59.470 --> 00:08:59.470
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>
