00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.660
<v 0>Brady thought that 10 was a really boring element,</v>

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.120
but we've changed his mind showing him that it does more than it says on the

3
00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:09.954
tin.

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.750
What we can show you is how 10 melts,

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.540
how you can join wires on the battlefield while you're being

6
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:22.950
fired at, by the enemy.

7
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.790
How you can stop things growing on the bottom of sips.

8
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.490
And also give you a few hints about a first-year chemistry course.

9
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.080
If you've come here to the university,

10
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.670
10 is in group 14, the same group has carbon.

11
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.990
So it is below germanium and above led.

12
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.880
It was really valuable in prehistoric times because

13
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.520
it was found that when you mix it with copper,

14
00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.710
you could make bronze and bronze melts at a lower

15
00:01:00.711 --> 00:01:03.950
temperature than copper. So it's easier to make weapons.

16
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.930
And the weapons were harder.

17
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.390
10 is found in a variety of minerals.

18
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.590
There are lots of sources of it in China, in Malaysia,

19
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.800
and also in Cornwall in the West of England.

20
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.140
<v 1>After the oil has been crushed and washed,</v>

21
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.550
the tin oxide is dried and the sample is tested for quality and good design

22
00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:28.580
project year with 140 pounds of 10 come a ton of all.

23
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.020
<v 0>Still many abandoned tin mines in Cornwall.</v>

24
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.690
They're quite dangerous. When you walk across the malls, there are open shafts,

25
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.620
which if you're not looking where you're going, you can fall down.

26
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.120
<v 1>Cornell could provide a third of all the tin required by this country.</v>

27
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.520
<v 0>We have been trying to look at 10 beginning with the metal.</v>

28
00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.440
One of the interesting things about tin is that it melts at quite a low

29
00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:02.810
temperature. So if you heat it up,

30
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.580
it melts around 230 degrees centigrade.

31
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.860
So even with a gas torch, you can melt it quite easily in the glass test tube.

32
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.870
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

33
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.640
<v 0>This low melting point is very useful for a whole series of</v>

34
00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:26.510
applications, particularly for so-called soda.

35
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.520
That is joining things, electrically. This is soda.

36
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.380
It is the metal,

37
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.150
which is used to make electrical connections in this case on a

38
00:02:38.151 --> 00:02:42.530
very old computer memory board now to make joints like

39
00:02:42.531 --> 00:02:47.450
this requires precise tools, and it's a bit boring,

40
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.640
but what we want to show you is how people joined wires together on the

41
00:02:52.641 --> 00:02:56.180
battlefield. For example, in the second world war,

42
00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.850
you've got to imagine you're on the battlefield. People are shooting at you.

43
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.400
You need to put down the telephone wires.

44
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:06.970
So you can talk to the groups on either side of you.

45
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.080
And the last thing you want to do is to get out to soldiering, I, and,

46
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.900
and wait for it to heat up. And so on.

47
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.620
I remembered that I had some self soldiering joints,

48
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.390
which I got when I was an army cadet. When I was about 15,

49
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.340
that's a copper tube with some soldier inside and some material

50
00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:30.940
that burns so that you can light it like a match.

51
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.400
So you take the two bits of electrical wire.

52
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.090
You want to join post one piece of wire in each end,

53
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.960
and then you light it. The soldier is insight.

54
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.760
I've had these 56 years and they weren't new when they got them.

55
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:49.600
So they probably come from the second world war. They'd probably surplus.

56
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.340
I thought they would work. Neil was a bit dubious as usual.

57
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.163
I was right.

58
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.700
So Neil set fire to the red part,

59
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.460
which is some sort of igniting mixture and it flared up

60
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.170
quite quickly. And then you can see the whole tube gets very hot. Now,

61
00:04:11.171 --> 00:04:15.340
of course you can't see the soldier because that's inside, but as it gets hot,

62
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.600
the soldier melts and runs around the

63
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.320
wires. And then as it cools down, it solidifies,

64
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.380
fixing the wires into the soap piece of copper tube.

65
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.180
On one occasion, we did it more than once.

66
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.050
You could see the soda coming out, just on one side.

67
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.280
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

68
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.920
<v 0>Just to show that the soldier was in there.</v>

69
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.550
I persuaded Neil and our new assistant Connor.

70
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.530
Who's joining our team to heat one of these pieces

71
00:04:55.531 --> 00:04:58.710
vertically so that when the soldier melts,

72
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.540
it will drop out to the bottom.

73
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.900
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

74
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.710
<v 0>Just to show you the guilt hops. We put the thermocouple,</v>

75
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.870
which niches temperature into the top.

76
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.820
So you can see the temperature going up and you can see the soldier running out.

77
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.630
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

78
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.700
<v 0>So we were really quite excited.</v>

79
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.060
Then we thought 10 is in the same group has carbon carbon burns.

80
00:05:38.061 --> 00:05:43.020
So perhaps 10 will burn well in the Bunsen, we found some very nice,

81
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.330
finally pouted 10 Neil started sprinkling the tin

82
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.130
into the flame of the Bunsen burner. And it was really beautiful.

83
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.070
<v 2>You could see all.</v>

84
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.620
<v 0>Sorts of swirling flames.</v>

85
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.030
And when the tin went into the flame, you got quite a bright colored light.

86
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:15.040
Now there's some argument whether it was valid or look,

87
00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.100
and, but there was a touch of green as well,

88
00:06:18.101 --> 00:06:20.230
which I think came off his bachelor.

89
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:26.470
It was really much more beautiful than any of us expected.

90
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.320
And then Neil had a really good idea.

91
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:34.210
He fed the powder into the air hole of the Bunsen

92
00:06:34.211 --> 00:06:34.990
burner.

93
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.670
The stream of gas then blew the powder up into the

94
00:06:39.671 --> 00:06:42.030
flame and that looked even better.

95
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.790
So we had two really good experiments demonstrations.

96
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.320
And so we felt really ready to go for a third. Now,

97
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.880
tin is very well known of having two different forms of the

98
00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:04.714
metal.

99
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:09.040
One of them is shiny and looks just like any other metal.

100
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.930
The other one is meant to be a sort of brownish color and crumbles away.

101
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.040
This transition between the two happens at low temperature.

102
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:22.240
And I'd seen the terrific time-lapse video on YouTube,

103
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.810
where you can see a block of metallic tin,

104
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.940
gradually crumbling away as this so-called tin pest spreads

105
00:07:30.941 --> 00:07:34.030
across. So we thought we will try the same,

106
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.510
but perhaps we were not quite so patient.

107
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.740
So first of all,

108
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.990
I had the tin soldier and we tried dunking the soldier

109
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.540
in liquid nitrogen.

110
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:05.410
It came out looking much the same,

111
00:08:05.411 --> 00:08:09.100
but we hoped it's transformed inside.

112
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:11.980
So Neil thumped it with a hammer

113
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.360
that was successful. It shattered the bits,

114
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.770
but there was absolutely no evidence that the metals had changed.

115
00:08:20.771 --> 00:08:23.410
It was just Neil's power that smashed it.

116
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.120
So we then tried a different experiment,

117
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:32.470
melting the tin and pouring the molten tin,

118
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.500
the liquid tin into liquid nitrogen.

119
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:40.150
The thinking here was that if we froze the liquid quickly,

120
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:45.220
it would go into the unstable form directly without going through the

121
00:08:45.221 --> 00:08:49.660
metallic one. So it was really quite spectacular when it went in,

122
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.950
there were great plumes of vapor, vapor,

123
00:08:53.951 --> 00:08:58.140
water vapor as nitrogen evaporated. And when we took it out,

124
00:08:58.770 --> 00:08:59.640
it was a relevant,

125
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:03.930
beautiful shape of long piece of tin,

126
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.870
But it was the shape of the test tube. So it looked by the autistic,

127
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.350
but it didn't demonstrate what we wanted.

128
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.650
We thought perhaps we were being a bit impatient.

129
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:21.210
So we left it in liquid nitrogen overnight while the piece of

130
00:09:21.211 --> 00:09:24.930
string in case it crumbled away. And sadly,

131
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:28.660
when we took it out the next day still hadn't transformed.

132
00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.490
We've been completely unsuccessful.

133
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:48.710
I think that when we did, we've done it to lower temperature.

134
00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:53.330
You probably need it a bit below freezing point of water.

135
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:57.410
So minus 10, minus 20 degrees centigrade.

136
00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.530
And when it's really cold liquid nitrogen temperature,

137
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:04.190
the atoms don't have enough thermal energy to rearrange.

138
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.550
If we left it in liquid nitrogen for a couple of years,

139
00:10:07.551 --> 00:10:10.520
perhaps something would happen. So as well as bronze,

140
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:14.240
there's a very well known alloy of tin called pewter.

141
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.910
Originally it was tin and lead.

142
00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:21.740
It's now tin with other metals is particularly famous in Malaysia,

143
00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:26.000
you get many souvenirs. And when I was in Malaysia,

144
00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:28.880
I was given this plate made that pewter.

145
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:33.860
And the reason why people like it is because you can melt it quite

146
00:10:33.861 --> 00:10:38.240
easily and make it into elaborate shapes. Like the pattern on this plate.

147
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:41.240
Now we really haven't talked about the chemistry. Yet.

148
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.830
10 is in the same group has carbon.

149
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:49.610
So it has four electrons in the outer shell.

150
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.350
But unlike carbon,

151
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:56.600
it can either use two of these electrons or four of these electrons for

152
00:10:56.601 --> 00:10:59.540
bonding. When it uses two electrons,

153
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:04.640
it forms say 10 dichloride standers chloride,

154
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.060
which is a salt rather like sodium chloride.

155
00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:13.250
So it dissolves in water makes a slightly cloudy

156
00:11:13.251 --> 00:11:16.790
mixture if you put too much in, but it dissolves,

157
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.830
but it will not dissolve in organic solvents. Like cyclohexane.

158
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:27.050
On the other hand, if you use four electrons,

159
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.890
you can make compounds like tin Tetra iodide,

160
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:35.060
which is one of the compounds our students make in the first year lab.

161
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.350
And we had two samples made by students and you can see the colors are a bit

162
00:11:39.351 --> 00:11:42.890
different because one made the purest sample than the other.

163
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.970
The 10 Tetra iodide is like an organic compound.

164
00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:48.800
If you put this one in water,

165
00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.120
the tin ID in bones react with,

166
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:58.450
so you get hydrogen iodide, which you can't see,

167
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:02.170
and you get to precipitate of tin oxide, which is white.

168
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.620
If you put it in an organic solvent, it dissolves.

169
00:12:05.621 --> 00:12:09.760
So you get a nice yellow solution. I wouldn't say anymore.

170
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:12.640
Or you might cheat when you're a student here,

171
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:18.190
10 oxides are important in screens on smart

172
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:22.570
phones and similar things because this display

173
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.450
consists of a material,

174
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.240
which is sandwiched between two electrodes.

175
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:33.370
And obviously the electrode through which you're looking has to be transparent

176
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.310
and indium tin oxide.

177
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.710
That's a mixed oxide,

178
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:43.030
indium and tin is electrically conducting,

179
00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.560
but is transparent.

180
00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:49.570
So Indian tin oxide is a key component of most

181
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:54.970
smartphones and other displays. So if you're watching this,

182
00:12:54.971 --> 00:12:58.900
you're probably watching it through thin film of indium tin oxide.

183
00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.960
The final application of 10,

184
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:06.610
I want to tell you about involves ships. This is a wooden ship,

185
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:09.790
but it's the only one I could find when the ship is made.

186
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:12.880
Obviously the bottom of the ship is absolutely clean,

187
00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:18.250
but as it sails around the seas, various Marine organisms,

188
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.560
mussels, barnacles, and so on,

189
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.950
fix themselves to the bottom of the sheep and start growing.

190
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.370
So eventually the bottom of the ship looks around the Lake,

191
00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:31.060
my hair with covered in these Marine organisms.

192
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.910
And this greatly slows down the shape.

193
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.720
It doesn't go through the water so easily. So for centuries,

194
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:41.410
people have tried different sorts of coating on the bottom of ships for

195
00:13:41.411 --> 00:13:45.880
so-called antifouling to stop organisms growing on them,

196
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:50.740
a very successful method is involved using organic tin compounds,

197
00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:54.100
usually derivatives of tribute, titled tin.

198
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:58.180
These are very effective in preventing growth on the bottom of ship.

199
00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.070
The problem is that the tin can leech dissolve

200
00:14:03.071 --> 00:14:07.900
off the bottom of the sheep and particularly Nieuports because there are a

201
00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.660
lot of ships there and they spend quite a lot of time there.

202
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.060
And when the tin comes out,

203
00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.600
of course it stops the organisms,

204
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:20.800
the barnacles fixing onto rocks and all sorts of things.

205
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:23.110
So in recent years,

206
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:28.030
there's been quite a strong movement to stop using tin in antifouling paints

207
00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:32.920
and to use clever paint chemistry to make the bottom so smooth,

208
00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:34.240
but nothing can stick to it.

209
00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:40.350
<v 3>There you go. And to think, I thought a video about 10 would be boring.</v>

210
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:41.880
As you probably know,

211
00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:44.880
we've made videos about all the elements on the periodic table,

212
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.880
but like the one you just watched, then we're redoing them,

213
00:14:47.881 --> 00:14:50.310
making them bigger and better. If you'd like to support us,

214
00:14:50.311 --> 00:14:51.980
help us make new videos,

215
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.640
like the people whose names you see on the screen at the moment you can back us

216
00:14:55.641 --> 00:14:59.930
on Patrion, go to patrion.com/periodic videos,

217
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.370
Patrion supporters, occasionally get little extra goodies. For example,

218
00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:08.600
I'm about to share with them this video about the professor's Ty collection.

219
00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:11.960
You haven't lived until you've seen a video about the professors tie collection.

220
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.360
Anyway, there are links down in the video description.

221
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:16.850
Thank you so much for watching and we'll be back soon.
