00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.980
<v 0>I'm in Paris in the UNESCO building here,</v>

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.960
I'm here for the ceremonial opening of the international year of the

3
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:13.500
periodic table. It started in January,

4
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.150
but now at the end of January is the full opening.

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.770
There's been a ceremony with lots of speeches with

6
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.360
ministers, all sorts of important people, making speeches,

7
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.080
Nobel prize winner, and also me.

8
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.700
<v 1>And then I came to do this unusual way.</v>

9
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.160
I'm good to take you on the tour I office in altering them.

10
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.000
And [inaudible] not all of the,

11
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.810
so finally, to celebrate this,

12
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.310
I want to show you a special video that my colleagues,

13
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.190
which we were not used to in about 10 minutes time.

14
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.850
So much though, I never seen so much of any element.

15
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.370
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

16
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.770
<v 1>Inserted the cube into the periodic table of the elements to the 10 is</v>

17
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.040
Here. I also found my very first female table.

18
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.410
<v 0>I have been showered with presence by all sorts of different people.</v>

19
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.750
I've lost count what I've had.

20
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.123
<v 1>Okay.</v>

21
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.780
<v 0>This one's really good. This is thin coating of aluminum oxide.</v>

22
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.390
And as you turn it, it changes color.

23
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.600
Also they have a terrific exhibition.

24
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.830
And what I've really liked to do is not so much to,

25
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.030
for you to hear the speeches. You can hear speeches anywhere,

26
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.300
but come and see some of the things in the exhibition.

27
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.000
These are high temperature superconductors,

28
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:18.200
which if you called them to liquid nitrogen temperature, display,

29
00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:21.680
the so-called Meissner effect and they repel magnets.

30
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.510
So you can make things levitate.

31
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.040
So this must be Mendel leaves flat.

32
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.820
<v 1>It's his office, I think. Yes. So you can look around and like,</v>

33
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.850
look wherever you look. Wow.

34
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.830
<v 0>I couldn't see his portraits. And it's quite a,</v>

35
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.270
quite a nice room. Yeah.

36
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:45.523
I've got the.

37
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.040
<v 1>Joy that yes, really. Well.</v>

38
00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.100
<v 0>I would rather done the experiment myself, I think, but it was quite fun.</v>

39
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.570
The ball runs nice. Debbie would get really excited at this.

40
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:06.930
<v 2>So where are you from</v>

41
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:14.663
into the water?

42
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.410
<v 0>Not too crazy.</v>

43
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.080
Mandalay proposed the periodic table for the first time he published it

44
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.490
in 1869. That's 150 years ago.

45
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.940
And not quite three years ago,

46
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.470
it suddenly struck me that the hundred and 50th anniversary would be a great

47
00:03:37.471 --> 00:03:41.070
time for chemists all over the world to celebrate this.

48
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.590
And I suggested it to the president of the international union of pure

49
00:03:46.591 --> 00:03:50.550
and applied chemistry. And then thankfully,

50
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.680
I didn't have to do anything else.

51
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.430
People got really excited and now they've made it happen.

52
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.560
And here I am to enjoy it.

53
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.940
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

54
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.710
<v 0>Of course I will have a very warm weaponry of Brady being here and keeping me</v>

55
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:20.663
and older.

56
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.740
But I hope also what I really will remember is

57
00:04:25.741 --> 00:04:30.660
the very warm things that people have said about our videos and how much of it

58
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.370
is helping them to teach chemistry and to enthuse people about the periodic

59
00:04:35.371 --> 00:04:36.204
table.

60
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.913
<v 2>Like that.</v>

61
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.170
<v 0>Part two of our video we're in Moscow, in Russia,</v>

62
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.150
we're in a building called the golden brain has strange things on top a bit like

63
00:04:48.151 --> 00:04:52.500
my hair only golden. And there's a huge number of people here.

64
00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:54.540
You can see selfies and Gardner as well.

65
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.410
<v 2>Look at all these people. How would you cameras up? Look at them all.</v>

66
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.070
What do you think of this professor? You're famous. Wow.

67
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.450
<v 0>I'm about to sit in men, the lift chair.</v>

68
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.323
It's amazing.

69
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.030
And I suppose this is nearly as close as I can get to Mandalay,

70
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.070
but on the other hand,

71
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.320
it looks as if the test has been covered again with, um,

72
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.300
new material. I suspect his cigarette burn.

73
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.850
So lots of health in this this morning,

74
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.780
I saw a really nice painting. I've seen it before.

75
00:05:36.781 --> 00:05:41.430
My favorite painting of men did at his desk cup of

76
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.920
tea cigarette in hand looking as if he's about to say something really

77
00:05:46.921 --> 00:05:51.900
interesting. So now I'm here noti no cigarette,

78
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.320
but I feel really proud to be here.

79
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.633
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

80
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.210
<v 1>[Inaudible] officer.</v>

81
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.370
[inaudible] what we paid more.

82
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.070
Yes. Is my belt.

83
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.123
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

84
00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.940
<v 1>No, yeah.</v>

85
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.890
At the effective ties, uh,

86
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.700
in my cardiac care specifically.

87
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:26.373
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

88
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:29.860
<v 1>You? Perfect. Are you ready?</v>

89
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.970
And it wouldn't be the periodic table that we noticed that I also,

90
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:41.920
my very first.

91
00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:58.270
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>
