00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.620
<v 0>Manganese is actually a much more interesting metal than you might</v>

2
00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:08.580
expect. I should say element perhaps the metal.

3
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.070
<v 1>So first thing we need to do is like the Bunsen. So there we are.</v>

4
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.750
Okay.

5
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.490
And then what we've got inside the boiling tube is actually potassium

6
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.383
manganese.

7
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.040
<v 0>One of the transition metals and the row of transition metals</v>

8
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.750
stretches all the way from scandium over here to

9
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.093
zinc over there.

10
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.900
What makes manganese particularly interesting is that it is in the middle of

11
00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:37.070
this transition group.

12
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.330
There are 10 transition metals from scandium to zinc

13
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.180
and manganese is number five.

14
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.190
The reason that 10 is because each of them has a certain

15
00:00:49.191 --> 00:00:53.960
number of D electrons. One for scandium 10 for zinc.

16
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.910
So manganese in the middle has five and five.

17
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.320
If you're a mathematician, you will notice half 10.

18
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.180
So it has exactly half the number of D electrons that can be

19
00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:09.350
accommodated in the shell.

20
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.240
<v 1>All I've gone and done is just popped a couple of spatulas of potassium from</v>

21
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.660
Andre into the Boyd in shape. And as you can see from the college, very,

22
00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:22.370
very dark, almost black, uh,

23
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.980
possibly a dark green. So that's in there.

24
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.580
<v 0>But let's begin just having looked at the metal itself.</v>

25
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.020
This is a bottle of manganese that Neil has lent us and

26
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.080
Brady promised that we wouldn't break it.

27
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.150
Don't tell anyone, but I dropped it and a bit has fallen out at the bottom.

28
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.160
He broke it, you broke it. It was going to be very angry.

29
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.830
Anyway, let's look at the metal.

30
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.260
So you can see the metal is in this particular form is coming

31
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.930
sheets, but has this rather bubbly feature on the

32
00:01:59.931 --> 00:02:00.764
surface?

33
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.030
This is the top of wherever the metals and it's been broken up.

34
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.980
What is also interesting that I've got magnet here and you can see

35
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.750
it's not magnetic at all and you

36
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.470
can't pick it up. Now. You can also,

37
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.260
why is it interesting if something's not magnetic?

38
00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:23.030
Lots of things are not magnetic.

39
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.510
And the reason that's interesting is if you look at it souls,

40
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.740
so this is a salt of manganese.

41
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.670
The label is not very good, but it's manganese sulfate.

42
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.430
[inaudible] the first thing that you notice is that it is almost white.

43
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.440
It's very slightly pink.

44
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.660
And this is surprising because especially in your first

45
00:02:47.661 --> 00:02:48.800
chemistry lessons,

46
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.420
they say the characteristic of the salt of transition

47
00:02:53.421 --> 00:02:58.160
metals is that they're colored and here's manganese sulfate.

48
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.640
Almost remember that manganese metal is not magnetic.

49
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.140
Let's take the same magnet into the sulfate,

50
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.220
push it down.

51
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.360
So you can see that the salt sticks to the magnet.

52
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.720
Now, I think that's extraordinary.

53
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.120
Normally you don't expect salts to be magnetic,

54
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.040
and it's even more surprising if the metal is not magnetic,

55
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.270
but that's all it is.

56
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.330
<v 1>Of the safety flame into the hot blue flame get so that</v>

57
00:03:33.331 --> 00:03:37.680
it's at the tip of the flame. It's nice and hot there.

58
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.970
Ah, you see a movement there, perfect that movement there.

59
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.650
All we can see going right the way up the tube,

60
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.730
and that's dropping back down again and what's happened there in the heat.

61
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.350
We've changed the oxidation state of the manganese to plus

62
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.243
six.

63
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.420
So it's now K to M N O four.

64
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.300
You're also getting oxygen,

65
00:04:00.301 --> 00:04:04.560
which is why you saw that movement of the powder as the gas is being liberated.

66
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.220
It shots up the tube and you're getting manganese dioxide there.

67
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.820
<v 0>And the reason why the salt is magnetic is because it has</v>

68
00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:18.660
five electrons, these five electrons in the D cell.

69
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.890
And they so-called, unpaired,

70
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.960
they're each in a different volume of space around the atom.

71
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.340
So each of them has a strong magnetic effect. And with all five of them,

72
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.540
it's really magnetic.

73
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.040
And the fact that the material has no color is

74
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.800
also associated with these five electrons.

75
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.560
If you drop solution of manganese sulfate,

76
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.540
which is also colorless into sodium hydroxide solution,

77
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.750
you get a precipitate of hydroxide.

78
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.730
And because there is air dissolved in the sodium hydroxide,

79
00:04:53.731 --> 00:04:58.170
the oxygen removes one of the electrons from the manganese.

80
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.500
So it now is so-called manganese three,

81
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.090
which has only four electrons and it's nice Brown color.

82
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.660
So you suddenly get this color change.

83
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.780
This was one of the first experiments I did in my second year of university in a

84
00:05:15.781 --> 00:05:20.430
practical class. They didn't tell us what was happening. We had to explain it.

85
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.440
<v 1>And so now we need to make sure all of it is being converted</v>

86
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.460
to plus six oxidation States.

87
00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:31.530
So I'm going to make sure it stays in that flame for just that bit longer.

88
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.510
<v 0>Really famous compounded manganese is potassium permanganates,</v>

89
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.140
which is a purple color potassium per blank.

90
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.170
The date is K M a new fall. In fact,

91
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.300
in the MNO four minus the permanganate iron manganese

92
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.150
has no D electrons at all.

93
00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:55.740
They've all gone to the oxygen and there's very bright color is because the

94
00:05:55.741 --> 00:05:59.630
light makes one, the electrons jump back to the manganese.

95
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.970
So you get this very intense color, which is very bright.

96
00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:08.030
Even the small amount of the material causes a lot of color.

97
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.130
And if you drop just a few tiny crystals of permanganates into water,

98
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.400
you can see this beautiful purple color spreading out.

99
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.930
I persuaded Sam to repeat one of the earliest

100
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:25.880
experiments. I did myself after reading about it in the book,

101
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.280
heating potassium permanganates.

102
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.900
<v 1>And so apart from that movement of the powder up and down the tube,</v>

103
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.110
it doesn't look like anything else is really happening.

104
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.010
<v 0>I did this when I was 14 or 15,</v>

105
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.800
Sam is using a nice boiling tube.

106
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.610
I used a metal spoon and a gas stove.

107
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.820
<v 1>We're going to put it into this, uh, centered funnel.</v>

108
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.120
That's sort of top of the conical flask.

109
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.870
And then I'm going to add some concentrated alkaline to it.

110
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.650
<v 0>And when you hit the permanganate up,</v>

111
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:06.580
there is a sort of small puff of gas, but nothing very exciting,

112
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.260
but then you make so-called potassium manganese that

113
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.780
K2 MNO four,

114
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.230
which is bright green.

115
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.960
If you put it in alkalized solution.

116
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.130
So same if she's done,

117
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.690
what I suggested has poured the solid out into a

118
00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:33.070
filter and then poured over it some

119
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.630
strong alkali,

120
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.920
and you should see this really nice dark green color solution coming through.

121
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.340
<v 1>Thank you. See that normally,</v>

122
00:07:45.341 --> 00:07:50.200
if you put potassium manganese in solution, or you just in water,

123
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:55.300
we'd go nice purple color. But here, because you've got K2 MN Oh four, um,

124
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.100
it's actually giving you a lovely green color.

125
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.070
<v 0>But it's a, not a very stable compound.</v>

126
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.400
And if you add acid to the solution,

127
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.770
it decomposes very quickly.

128
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.920
And so you get permanganates back again, plus a precipitate,

129
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.820
which you may or may not be able to see of manganese dioxide,

130
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.280
which is Brown solid. Now,

131
00:08:18.281 --> 00:08:21.280
when I did this experiment as a school boy in the kitchen,

132
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.860
I didn't know all of this chemistry and my sister's clothes were on the

133
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.710
draining board of the sink. They were being washed.

134
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.410
And I'm just saying to say,

135
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:37.660
and I didn't notice that some of the [inaudible] or magnate got onto my

136
00:08:37.661 --> 00:08:42.460
sister's clothes and Brown spots appeared all over it.

137
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:47.530
And it was not very popular with my parents. What were you punished?

138
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:52.540
I can't remember. I think I was forgiving in the interests of science.

139
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.810
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

140
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:13.520
<v 3>13,487. Jacqueline has that.</v>

141
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.250
I feel like I should. You should.

142
00:09:16.251 --> 00:09:20.360
That is the biggest Brady number that appears in the first 1 million desperate

143
00:09:20.361 --> 00:09:21.350
places of PI.

144
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:21.500
<v 2>Right?</v>
