00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.160
<v 0>One of the big surprises of the whole periodic video project for</v>

2
00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:09.600
me was my actually seeing a sample of technetium

3
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.920
before I tell you how I saw it, let me explain why I was surprised.

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.660
Technetium was one of four elements that were predicted by

5
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.020
Mendeleev to exist in the periodic table, but had not yet been discovered.

6
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.280
He predicted it first to have an atomic weight of a hundred,

7
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.730
which he then revised to 99, which was pretty accurate.

8
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.710
So take Newseum is element 43 and obviously between

9
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.700
molybdenum, which is 42 and routine, which is 44,

10
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.090
the real discovery came when two Italians,

11
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.640
Emilio segregate and color Perrier in Palermo in Sicily was

12
00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:55.380
sent a sample of molybdenum that had been irradiated

13
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.380
in the cyclotron in Berkeley.

14
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.540
It had been irradiated with a mixture of neutrons and due to runs due to

15
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:07.950
rums are the nucleus of deuterium, one proton,

16
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.903
one neutron.

17
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.430
And so cigarette and period were desolving up this piece of

18
00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:19.050
molybdenum, which was highly radioactive. So they let it sit for a bit.

19
00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:21.360
So some of the radioactivity decade,

20
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.430
just to find what was in it by carefully precipitating and

21
00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:28.470
seeing where the radioactivity went,

22
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.750
they isolated the first sample of technetium,

23
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.820
but it was too small to see,

24
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.160
but by its behavior and the fact that it precipitated together with rhenium,

25
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.400
they could tell that it must be in the same group.

26
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.910
I think it was just sent to them because they were interested.

27
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.390
Nobody thought expected, take new, seem to be in it.

28
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.340
And the technetium was there for the first element that had

29
00:01:56.341 --> 00:01:59.460
ever been made. Synthetically chemists,

30
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.670
who were looking at the structure of the periodic table,

31
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.660
felt that synthetic elements were somehow cheating.

32
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.510
So it should not be put on the periodic table.

33
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.370
Can you imagine that the paper was published in 1937 and

34
00:02:14.371 --> 00:02:16.620
nothing happened to the second world war.

35
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.140
Then in the second world war, there was the Manhattan project,

36
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.820
the development of nuclear weapons and lots of new synthetic

37
00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:30.450
elements were discovered, particularly plutonium,

38
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.620
which had never been discovered before and after the war,

39
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.310
1947, very shortly before I was born,

40
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.200
there was a historic paper was published in the journal nature by the

41
00:02:43.201 --> 00:02:47.880
German chemist Paneth who during Nazi times had moved to the UK

42
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.200
and was working at the university of Durham. He laid down the ground rules,

43
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.340
which exist to this day for the naming of elements.

44
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.270
Number one,

45
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.200
the right to name an should go to the first presumably group or

46
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:06.520
person to give definite proof of the existence of one of its

47
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:11.380
isotopes. Second point in deciding the priority of the discovery.

48
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.280
There should be no discrimination between naturally occurring,

49
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.150
an artificially produced isotopes. And the third point,

50
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.040
and this is very important.

51
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.450
If a claim to such a discovery has been accepted in the past,

52
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.310
but is refuted. That means contradicted by later research,

53
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.290
the names should be deleted and replaced by one chosen by the real discoverer.

54
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.930
And those rules applied to this day.

55
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.600
And it was technetium that really precipitated this.

56
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.250
So what happened then was that the names of six new

57
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:49.084
elements,

58
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.470
including plutonium were accepted and cigarette and period were

59
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.850
invited to name their elements and they chose the name

60
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.920
technetium in the same journal in a really short paper from the

61
00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:05.320
Greek word, which means synthetic.

62
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.120
So it is embodied in his name that it was the first synthetic

63
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.950
element in the early 1960s with improvement of instrumentation.

64
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.090
People discovered that in uranium minerals,

65
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.640
because of the radioactive decay of uranium, you can detect tiny,

66
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:29.170
tiny traces of technetium and

67
00:04:29.171 --> 00:04:31.990
therefore it is natural after all.

68
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.850
So the name isn't quite right. And then in 1972,

69
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.470
there was an extraordinary discovery by geologists in Gabon,

70
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.340
in Africa,

71
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.530
where they discovered that in a uranium deposits underground

72
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.420
about a million years ago, a natural nuclear reactor had started.

73
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.190
There was a high enough concentration of uranium for nuclear reaction to take

74
00:04:57.191 --> 00:05:00.430
place. And because of this nuclear reaction,

75
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.920
there were in fact traces of technetium found under the ground because of

76
00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:10.630
all the nuclear research that was done during the Manhattan project,

77
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.610
there was an abundant supply of technetium became available after the

78
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:20.200
second world war and people started stunting the chemistry and you can get a

79
00:05:20.201 --> 00:05:23.320
wide range of compounds. And as you might expect,

80
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.820
the chemistry is perhaps a little closer to rhenium than to

81
00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:31.150
manganese because heavier elements tend to be more similar.

82
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.830
But one of the most interesting applications turns out to be in medicine.

83
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.490
The application is in diagnosis.

84
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.260
When people have cancer,

85
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.480
it's often quite hard to see the tumors or particularly the secondary

86
00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:51.250
tumors that spread across somebody's body because they're small and they are not

87
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.300
easily imaged,

88
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.710
but turns out that if you take radioactive molybdenum,

89
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.610
molybdenum 99,

90
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.870
it decays by emission of electrons to make

91
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.860
technetium,

92
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.840
but very unusually and something which we've never talked about before the

93
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.610
technetium is formed with the nucleus in an excited

94
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:18.560
state that is with higher energy than it might have otherwise in this excited

95
00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:23.180
state is symbolized by the letter M which stands for meta

96
00:06:23.181 --> 00:06:26.510
stable, which means it's stable for a short time, but not very long.

97
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.820
And so what happens is this matter staple,

98
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.650
technetium decays to the stable isotope or stable

99
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:37.700
state, but with the same mass and gives out a gamma Ray,

100
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.680
which can penetrate a large distance through, for example, human flesh,

101
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.810
and then much more slowly, the take new SIM 99 decay is to routine Liam.

102
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.580
So what happens is that if you do your chemistry very quickly,

103
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.560
you can isolate this technetium 99

104
00:06:57.561 --> 00:07:00.890
M and before it decays,

105
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.700
you can react it with another chemical,

106
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.230
which will complex that's bind round the technetium and you

107
00:07:09.231 --> 00:07:11.510
choose this, um,

108
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:16.070
binding chemical so that it will also bind to tumor cells

109
00:07:16.071 --> 00:07:21.020
selectively. It will bind to the tumor and not to ordinary organs.

110
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.530
So quickly you inject it into the patients.

111
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.660
It goes round the body and is localized at the tumors.

112
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.330
Then if you put the patient into a suitable detector or

113
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.140
array of detectors, you can measure the gamma rays coming out,

114
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.850
and the gamma rays will come out much more strongly from where the tumors are.

115
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.870
And because the techniques simply case rapidly,

116
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:52.970
you can get a good signal to do your imaging without

117
00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:56.690
giving the patient a big overall dose of radioactivity.

118
00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.290
So now this brings me back to how I saw technetium.

119
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.300
Some years ago,

120
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.650
I went to zero at university and met a professor,

121
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:11.900
Roger Alberto who's one of the world's experts in techniques in

122
00:08:11.901 --> 00:08:14.000
chemistry. During the coffee break,

123
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:18.080
Roger came up to me and pulled out of his pocket,

124
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:22.820
a little metal vile and unscrewed the lid and took out

125
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.280
a glass container.

126
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:29.890
And inside was a piece of metal coated with techniques.

127
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.650
I was amazed. I never thought I would be able to see this.

128
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:37.160
So I immediately asked him how he could get hold of this stuff.

129
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:42.230
And she explained that one of his coworkers had used electrolysis

130
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.700
that's parsing electric,

131
00:08:43.701 --> 00:08:48.050
current through a solution to deposit a thin layer

132
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.410
of technetium onto a piece of copper.

133
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.230
Now you don't need very much metal,

134
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:59.400
only a few nanometers to see what the metal looks like,

135
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:03.630
because light doesn't go through it. And in fact, this particular sample,

136
00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:08.280
I think had probably a couple of milligrams of technetium on it.

137
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:12.240
So it looked just the same as a large block of techniques and would look,

138
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.730
but I felt really excited because here was an element which

139
00:09:17.731 --> 00:09:20.970
I'd seen sort of in brackets on the periodic table.

140
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:25.140
And I never thought I would actually hold a sample in my hand,

141
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.940
or I held the glass bottle and because take Newseum decays

142
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:33.840
by beater emission, that's emitting electrons.

143
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:38.640
And these electrons don't penetrate through material very easily,

144
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:43.350
even as small glass file is quite enough to protect people,

145
00:09:43.351 --> 00:09:46.620
at least for a short time. So I could safely hold it.

146
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.440
And in triumph,

147
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:54.600
I held it against my tie next to the symbol of technetium and

148
00:09:54.601 --> 00:09:56.820
I felt I'd really made the discovery.

149
00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:59.900
<v 1>There. Thanks for watching this video. Of course,</v>

150
00:09:59.901 --> 00:10:03.860
we have made videos on every element on the periodic table on the screen right

151
00:10:03.861 --> 00:10:07.460
now I will put links to a playlist so you can watch well,

152
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:11.180
all hundred and 18 in order, if you want. Some of them are quite old,

153
00:10:11.181 --> 00:10:13.610
but we are updating them with new videos all the time,

154
00:10:13.611 --> 00:10:16.580
like this one to make bigger and better videos about each element.

155
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:21.140
And you can support the process as well on Patrion. And if you do that,

156
00:10:21.141 --> 00:10:25.370
there's a chance for you to adopt an element on our periodic videos webpage,

157
00:10:25.371 --> 00:10:28.190
and you can have your name there under that particular element,

158
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:32.450
check it out at patrion.com/periodic videos. But as always,

159
00:10:32.451 --> 00:10:34.910
the best thing you can do is keep watching here on YouTube,

160
00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:38.450
stay subscribed to the channel, switch on the notifications. So, you know,

161
00:10:38.451 --> 00:10:40.850
every time we upload a new video and we'll see you again.

162
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:42.050
<v 0>Very soon,</v>
