00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.280
<v 0>So I've got really quite a funny story to tell you last year,</v>

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.660
as many of you know was the international year of the periodic table.

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.850
And during the year I've been going around all sorts of places,

4
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.250
giving essentially a very similar lecture about the

5
00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:21.480
periodic table

6
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.790
and the lecture takes the form of a tour.

7
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.600
Run my office at the university of Nottingham,

8
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.980
showing you some of the periodic tables that I've got.

9
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.080
And one particular thing I show is a periodic table

10
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.560
from the Royal Australian chemical Institute,

11
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.960
which was devised for the international year of chemistry nine years

12
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:49.740
ago.

13
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.270
And artists from Tasmania painted pictures of all sorts of different

14
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:55.140
elements.

15
00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.420
And one of the artists sent me a picture of the element gallium.

16
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.550
Now I explained that this picture is a choke on

17
00:01:05.551 --> 00:01:10.320
several different levels. You can see it's got a Cockerel in the middle,

18
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.390
which is the symbol of France. Gallium is named after France,

19
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.840
after the Latin name for France school.

20
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.970
It's also a joke because the Latin word for a chicken is

21
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.440
Gallus. So you have the French symbol and the pun in Latin.

22
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.880
And then there's a third joke because the chemist who

23
00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:33.840
discovered,

24
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.640
or at least isolated gallium for the first time was called lacak,

25
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.020
which is the French for cultural. So there's a third suit.

26
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.560
Now, if you look at the top right-hand corner,

27
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.450
there's a radioactive symbol. And for all these lectures,

28
00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:52.710
I have each time saying,

29
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.300
I have no idea why that simple is there.

30
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.620
And then my last lecture, which was just over a month ago,

31
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.420
just before the lockdown,

32
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.980
one of the people in the audience was the boyfriend

33
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.530
of one of our Nottingham students. And she told him about the lecture.

34
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.520
And so he came along and after the lecture,

35
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.980
he thoughts of an explanation of the radioactive symbol and

36
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:25.170
got the student to email it to me.

37
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.380
And his explanation was really quite funny and

38
00:02:31.381 --> 00:02:34.350
really unusual and involves chickens.

39
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.210
He pointed out that in the late

40
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:40.530
1950s,

41
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.210
the British army in Germany had a

42
00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:49.830
mad scheme to stop the Russians invading Germany.

43
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.810
If they tried and their scheme was to bury

44
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.660
nuclear bombs under the ground.

45
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.270
And the idea was that if the Russians invaded,

46
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.300
these bombs could be blown up.

47
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.800
So these were nuclear landmines, but really quite powerful,

48
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.750
nearly as powerful as the dreadful bomb that destroyed her Russia

49
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:14.643
in Japan.

50
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.840
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

51
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.550
<v 0>Unfortunately there was a technical problem that when you buried</v>

52
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.200
these mines, these nuclear mines under the ground in winter,

53
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.620
they could get cold. And the electronics,

54
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.920
which in those days were quite primitive, might stop working.

55
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.930
Now you have to realize these bombs were really large,

56
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.770
the size of a large freezer, if not bigger,

57
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.820
there was really quite a lot of space inside the casing.

58
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.040
And so the proposed solution to this freezing of the

59
00:03:53.041 --> 00:03:57.420
electronics was to put some grain and some

60
00:03:57.421 --> 00:04:00.120
water and to chicken,

61
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.770
a live chicken inside the bomb case before we buried it,

62
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.750
it was worked out that the chicken would live for about a week before it

63
00:04:09.751 --> 00:04:10.584
died.

64
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.660
And that was long enough because if the invasion hadn't taken

65
00:04:15.661 --> 00:04:17.010
place within the week,

66
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.820
you could dig up the mine and recharge it.

67
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.530
The idea was that the chicken would produce enough body

68
00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:30.120
heat just to keep the electronics warm. Presumably when it died,

69
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.770
it would become a frozen chicken.

70
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.993
<v 1>Professor.</v>

71
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.000
What would happen to the chicken if they ended up having to set the bomb off?

72
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.231
<v 0>Well,</v>

73
00:04:37.231 --> 00:04:41.940
the chicken would have been evaporated together with much of the

74
00:04:41.941 --> 00:04:44.610
rest of the surrounding area.

75
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.460
<v 1>All right. So then you get a roast chicken. Well.</v>

76
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.920
<v 0>I think you would get a vaporized chicken,</v>

77
00:04:49.921 --> 00:04:52.470
if not an atomized chicken,

78
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.950
although the British are very sentimental about animals.

79
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.380
I don't think they were worried about the chicken.

80
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.460
This whole project was called operation blue peacock.

81
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.320
The bone friends' explanation was that this radioactive symbol

82
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.480
referred to operation blue peacock because of course there's the chicken

83
00:05:12.481 --> 00:05:14.070
on the painting.

84
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.670
<v 1>And the, and the also the piece of artwork is quite blue in color. Isn't it?</v>

85
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.730
<v 0>Yes. So I thought this was really clever.</v>

86
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.710
And I also thought that it demonstrated quite a nice point about scientific

87
00:05:25.711 --> 00:05:29.940
experiments, that when you're building some expensive,

88
00:05:29.941 --> 00:05:33.180
some complicated piece of equipment,

89
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.900
you need to spend a lot of money on the key parts,

90
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.390
but for the less important parts you can use really quite a simple

91
00:05:42.391 --> 00:05:46.260
device just to achieve whatever you want in this case,

92
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.270
using a chicken as a heater.

93
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.880
<v 1>What do you think of that idea, professor?</v>

94
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.710
<v 0>I think it's completely mad,</v>

95
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.820
but I think in the end it was also considered mad by everybody

96
00:05:58.821 --> 00:06:02.420
because it was never implemented. However,

97
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.670
and the really nice twist to this story is I suddenly

98
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:12.590
thought I could Google the Australian website

99
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:16.160
and see what the artists said about this radioactive symbol.

100
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.240
And it turns out that the explanations really boring.

101
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.070
It's a reference to the use of radioactive gallium in medicine

102
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.670
for some sort of treatment or diagnosis.

103
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.390
So the blue peacock, although true,

104
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.490
was completely irrelevant.

105
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.460
And that demonstrates another really important principle of science,

106
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.920
which was propounded in medieval times and is called

107
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:46.611
outcomes.

108
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:51.290
Raiser outcome is the guy who thought of it and raise, uh,

109
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.670
is the thing that you use for shaving and outcomes.

110
00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.930
Razor says when you have some effect, some problem,

111
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.390
and you have two explanations,

112
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.810
one that simple and the other that's complicated.

113
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.050
It's usually the simple one that is correct.

114
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:14.000
So this picture has given me great pleasure because taught me

115
00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:16.130
about operation blue peacock.

116
00:07:16.131 --> 00:07:20.930
They knew nothing about and gave me a nice reminder about Ockham's razor.

117
00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.173
<v 1>Professor.</v>

118
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.870
You mentioned that they didn't end up using the chickens cause they thought it

119
00:07:25.871 --> 00:07:27.250
was probably a mad idea.

120
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.300
Did they actually end up using the nuclear minds to,

121
00:07:31.301 --> 00:07:33.850
in case of the Russian invasion or did that not happen either?

122
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.050
<v 0>No, I think they didn't. They,</v>

123
00:07:36.051 --> 00:07:41.050
they thought the idea of the nuclear mines was a bad idea and they thought

124
00:07:41.051 --> 00:07:42.700
they didn't need the chickens.

125
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:48.130
I don't think the people who were responsible for strategy

126
00:07:48.131 --> 00:07:51.430
went down to the level of the chickens inside the bomb.

127
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:57.850
So the question you didn't ask me and which really intrigues me is what

128
00:07:57.851 --> 00:08:01.930
happened. If the chickens started laying eggs inside the bone,

129
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.830
would that upset the electronics.
