00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.040
<v 0>One of Neil's favorite experiments and mine is dropping red,</v>

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.510
hot charcoal into liquid oxygen in a cauldron, a bowl.

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.200
You've seen it before, but now we're going to show it to you.

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.030
Like you've never seen it.

5
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.460
We're going to show you how we do the experiment from the very beginning.

6
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.090
And we're going to show it to with a thermal imaging camera.

7
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.610
So you can see which bits get hot,

8
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.360
which bits get cold and even see some of the temperatures.

9
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.230
The first thing is that you have to fetch some liquid nitrogen from the tank.

10
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.040
It's usually a bit of a chore, but when you look at the temperatures,

11
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.020
it's really quite interesting.

12
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.680
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

13
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.450
<v 0>Once Neil did that, he had to carry the doers back to his lab,</v>

14
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.120
where we can to make the liquid oxygen. Now,

15
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.830
liquid oxygen has a higher boiling point than liquid nitrogen.

16
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.420
And so you can condense liquid oxygen using

17
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.790
liquid nitrogen because it's colder.

18
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.700
So you begin with a cylinder,

19
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.460
that's a high pressure bottle of oxygen.

20
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.970
Now the pressure of the gas is far too high to use for the experiment.

21
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.290
So you have to reduce the pressure with a so-called regulator,

22
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.920
which sits on the top of the cylinder. Once you've got it flowing,

23
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.810
you flow it through coil of copper, copper conducts heat very well.

24
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.090
So if you put the coil of copper in the liquid nitrogen and flow the

25
00:01:50.091 --> 00:01:52.530
oxygen through, it will liquefy,

26
00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.870
But because there's a flow,

27
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.950
it goes right through and doesn't solidify in the coil.

28
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.920
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

29
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.150
<v 0>So the gas comes out to the cylinder. It's a low pressure,</v>

30
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.080
but flowing quite fast. It flows down to,

31
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.150
into the copper coil, which is cold in the coil it liquefies.

32
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.160
And when it liquefies the flowing gas blows through probably

33
00:02:28.161 --> 00:02:32.510
droplets or slugs of liquid out of the other side,

34
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.580
and then it's fast enough so that it doesn't all boil away when it goes through

35
00:02:37.581 --> 00:02:41.390
the last piece of tube. And then it goes into Thermo's flask.

36
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.800
We didn't have much oxygen. And because once it's in the bowl,

37
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.780
it will boil away quite quickly.

38
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.090
<v 2>It was important to get the hot charcoal ready first because the</v>

39
00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:56.780
charcoal will gently burn in air. So once it's hot,

40
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.490
it will stay hot for quite a long time. So Neil heated,

41
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:04.330
the Chaco really light lighting, a barbecue.

42
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:11.140
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

43
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.450
<v 0>Remember we only have one thermos of liquid oxygen.</v>

44
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.140
And as soon as you pour something cold into the bowl,

45
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.280
which starts at room temperature, a lot of it will boil away.

46
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.610
So Neil didn't want to waste the oxygen.

47
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.580
So he cooled the bowl,

48
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.280
pre-cool it with liquid nitrogen,

49
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.100
because he has far more liquid nitrogen oxygen.

50
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.970
The bolts made of metal.

51
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.350
So it cools quite quickly because it doesn't have a very high heat capacity.

52
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.250
Once the boat is cold, when he paused in the liquid oxygen,

53
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.210
it will still boil a little bit, but it won't boil very violently.

54
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.260
So we won't waste.

55
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.600
So it goes the liquid oxygen into the pre-cool metrics.

56
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.450
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

57
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.280
<v 0>Neil was ready. He had to contain it with several pieces of hot Choco. Now,</v>

58
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.780
obviously when you drop them in, you have Choco, which is carbon,

59
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.010
which is going to burn really brightly and the presence of oxygen.

60
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.740
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

61
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.660
<v 0>When it stopped in the ordinary video camera completely whites</v>

62
00:04:51.661 --> 00:04:55.350
out looks really good looks as if the whole world has ended,

63
00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.390
but the thermal imaging camera looks very much more

64
00:05:00.391 --> 00:05:01.860
selective wavelengths.

65
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.790
So you can actually see what's happening to the piece of childcare.

66
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.790
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

67
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.670
<v 0>Not only can you see, but you can measure its temperature.</v>

68
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.600
So you have two really good bits of scientific information.

69
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:24.480
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

70
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.150
<v 0>There was a really interesting thing that happened.</v>

71
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.580
One of the pieces that Neil dropped in, went the usual flash of light,

72
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.350
and nobody knew what was happening.

73
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.360
But Brady who was looking through the thermal imaging cameras said it's broken

74
00:05:39.361 --> 00:05:44.070
into. And then when things had subsided, what has happened,

75
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.930
you could see, in fact, two pieces of charcoal, it's important to stress.

76
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.360
The liquid oxygen is very cold.

77
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.150
The charcoal is very hot.

78
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.580
It's somewhere between 900 and a degrees centigrade.

79
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.800
And so the way that these two can,

80
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.230
co-exist something that's very hot and something that's very cold is that

81
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.150
the shell code is probably surrounded by a bubble of gas.

82
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.830
Now you can't see that hot gas because it's probably not radiating in the same

83
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:20.750
way as the telco, but you do need to remember,

84
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:25.520
you can't have a liquid at minus nearly 200 degrees

85
00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:30.500
centigrade in contact with the surface. That's a thousand degrees centigrade.

86
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.570
So the charcoal is surrounded by a cushion of air except it's

87
00:06:35.571 --> 00:06:36.021
round.

88
00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:40.550
So it's more like a bubble and that's important because of course the oxygen

89
00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:45.470
gas gets much more efficiently to the surface to maintain the burning.

90
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.810
Eventually the reaction slows down and the oxygen

91
00:06:53.811 --> 00:06:58.010
rushes in and cools down the remaining fragments of childco.

92
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.130
So probably when Neil washed it out,

93
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.330
he found some small pieces of charcoal bottom.

94
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:30.280
We thank Google's making and science initiative for helping us

95
00:07:30.281 --> 00:07:34.090
make this video. If you want more information about the initiative,
