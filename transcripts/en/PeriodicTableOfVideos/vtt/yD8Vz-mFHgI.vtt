00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.180
<v 0>We're going to tell you about the chemistry for all snake.</v>

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:05.993
<v 1>My goodness.</v>

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.270
<v 0>It's a fascinating element.</v>

4
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.420
<v 1>Very poisonous.</v>

5
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.230
<v 0>Compounds murders have been carried out with it.</v>

6
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.960
It has some very nice connections with ancient wallpaper.

7
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.380
And Neil is going to show you a whole series of experience.

8
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.990
The books say that our snake looks metallic,

9
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.050
but our sample looked a bit Brown.

10
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.490
So Neil heated it in a test tube. I'll snakes.

11
00:00:46.491 --> 00:00:50.900
Interesting. It doesn't melt it. Sublimes when you heat it.

12
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.640
That is the vapor is formed and condenses on the side of the

13
00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:57.410
vessel. And if you look carefully,

14
00:00:57.411 --> 00:01:01.970
you can see it makes a very nice metallic film often called an

15
00:01:01.971 --> 00:01:06.890
arsenic mirror. Arsenic is particularly famous as a poison.

16
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.960
People used it to get rid of their lovers, their waves,

17
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.610
or just go with people.

18
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.080
And the compound they used is arsenic oxide,

19
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.010
ASMR four Oh six. Now we didn't have a sample of this.

20
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.070
So we decided that Neil would make some forests.

21
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.320
So he began by dissolving our snake in dilute nitric

22
00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:34.154
acid.

23
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.060
There's quite a violent reaction, lots of bubbling.

24
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.810
And it forms the gas and nitric oxide,

25
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.490
which is colorless,

26
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.510
but it reacts with air to give nitrogen dioxide,

27
00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:51.590
which is Brown.

28
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.580
So you can see Brown fumes coming out to the test tube.

29
00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.220
The textbooks say that when you dissolve our snake in nitric acid,

30
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.000
you make a solution of the oxide.

31
00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:09.470
We want the poisonous oxide it's meant taste of sugar.

32
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.480
Neil set up a very nice filter system, poured the solution in,

33
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.920
and it came through. I must say it did still look a little Brown,

34
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.670
but we were really hopeful. We were going to get our white powder.

35
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.990
The next stage of course is to go from solution to solid.

36
00:02:29.991 --> 00:02:32.570
So you have to evaporate of the water.

37
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.630
It was a bit slow process.

38
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.290
I got bored and went out while Neil was finishing it.

39
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.380
What a disappointment instead of this lovely white powder,

40
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.780
there was some sticky Brown solid I presume because we've

41
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:09.210
still got some parts circles of our snake in the white powder.

42
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.550
At least we've tried,

43
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.320
but I still think it's probably our snake oxide.

44
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.730
The reason they used us, Nick oxide was they could easily get it.

45
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.670
It was a white powder. It tasted sweet.

46
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.790
So it wasn't very noticeable if you mixed it with sugar.

47
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.380
So our Brown stuff is not going to be much use for poisoning people.

48
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.420
Fortunately, we're not going to try.

49
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.990
I have two favorite stories about poisoning.

50
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.090
Both of them are true.

51
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.650
The first one happened in a town in the North of England called

52
00:03:43.651 --> 00:03:47.790
Bradford. It happened in 1858 in October.

53
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.450
In those days, sugar was quite expensive.

54
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.310
So people who made sweets were very dishonest and added some

55
00:03:56.311 --> 00:04:00.990
cheap powder to the sugar so that they didn't have to put so much sugar in the

56
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.540
sweets. They called this white powder daft on this particular occasion,

57
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.230
a sweet maker called John Neil,

58
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.500
sent his lodger to go and get some daft to put

59
00:04:16.501 --> 00:04:18.480
in his next batch of sweets.

60
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.920
He called them lots of inches and he went to the next town

61
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.060
and went to a pharmacist.

62
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.130
And the pharmacist told his assistant to go and fetch the daft,

63
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.650
which was the white powder. And unfortunately he didn't explain correctly.

64
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.280
So the pharmacist so old 12 pounds,

65
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.630
that's five kilos of arsenic oxide to the

66
00:04:45.631 --> 00:04:47.100
unfortunate customer.

67
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.660
This was mixed in with the sweet mixture and more than 20

68
00:04:51.661 --> 00:04:56.070
people died of arsenic poisoning in Bradford and more than

69
00:04:56.071 --> 00:04:57.960
200 were really ill.

70
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.790
And this was one of the things that led to greater control of our snake

71
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.860
in the United Kingdom.

72
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.450
The other case took place in the early 1920s

73
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.580
in a town in the West of England called Hayan why the

74
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.420
attacks were carried out by a solicitor,

75
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.490
a lawyer who in fact was the only lawyer who's ever been hanged in the

76
00:05:23.491 --> 00:05:24.240
UK.

77
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.070
It is believed he poisoned his wife with our snake over a period of

78
00:05:29.071 --> 00:05:30.420
several months.

79
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.070
And then one of his business rivals was

80
00:05:35.071 --> 00:05:36.450
invited to tea.

81
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.470
The lawyer passed a scone,

82
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.330
a little cake in his fingers to his rival. And as he passed it,

83
00:05:45.331 --> 00:05:48.750
he said, excuse fingers. And in that moment,

84
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.390
it is believed he put our snake on the cake.

85
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.280
His guest was very ill and was found to have been poisoned with our

86
00:05:56.281 --> 00:05:56.870
snake.

87
00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.580
So they exhumed the body of his wife DocuTAP and it was full of

88
00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:02.360
arsenic.

89
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.310
So he was tried and convicted and it's executed.

90
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.300
It should be said that he always denied that he had done this,

91
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.740
that when he was arrested,

92
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.460
he did have our Snick powder in the packet in his pocket.

93
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.360
Did he a good white powder or have Brown sludge? She had nice white powder.

94
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.400
The question is,

95
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.200
how did they find our snake in the body of his dead wife?

96
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.990
Who'd been under the ground for several months.

97
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.640
And it's with a very clever test that was invented in the early 19th

98
00:06:34.641 --> 00:06:39.320
century called Marsh is test and Neil decided he would like to

99
00:06:39.321 --> 00:06:40.970
do Marsh's test too.

100
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.590
The first thing you have to do is add metallic sync.

101
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.610
I was really excited. I was allowed to chop up the zinc.

102
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:54.050
You put in the pieces of sink into round bottom flask,

103
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:58.280
and then you add whatever you think contains arsenic.

104
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.050
In our case, a small amount of Neal's Brown sludge,

105
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.430
And then throw them a dropping funnel.

106
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:20.050
You drop in dilute sulfuric acid and the sulfuric

107
00:07:20.051 --> 00:07:23.590
acid reacts with the zinc and generates hydrogen.

108
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.450
And the hydrogen reacts with the snake and makes a

109
00:07:28.451 --> 00:07:32.350
compound, which has a similar formula to ammonia,

110
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:37.120
but it has three hydrogens attached to our snake rather than three

111
00:07:37.121 --> 00:07:40.510
hydrogens are types to nitrogen, which you have in pneumonia.

112
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.310
And this compound called RCN is very volatile. It's a gas

113
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:52.720
As the hydrogen streams off the reaction, it takes the RC in with it.

114
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:57.590
You're then meant to light the stream of hydrogen coming out of the nozzle.

115
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.360
The top of the operators, if it's just hydrogen coming out,

116
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.490
it would be colorless.

117
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:09.010
And Brady was absolutely convinced that we would see a

118
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:10.420
colorless list flame,

119
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:14.890
and he could tell us how bad we'd been at the experiment.

120
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.820
<v 1>Oh my goodness. It works. I can't believe it works.</v>

121
00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.670
That's amazing. Yes. You happy? Yes.

122
00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.790
So the murderer is guilty Martin.

123
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.310
<v 0>Much to all our surprise.</v>

124
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:37.030
The flame came out a beautiful lavender color.

125
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.020
Lavender is the color that arsenic burns with,

126
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.830
but the real elegance of Marsh's test is that

127
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.050
if you put a cold surface,

128
00:08:50.051 --> 00:08:54.370
a piece of glass or a piece of porcelain into the flame,

129
00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.220
Our scene does not burn completely.

130
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:05.690
So you get a thin film of our snake on the surface.

131
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.410
The importance of this was that once the film's there,

132
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.730
it will stay there.

133
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.380
So it could be taken to court to be shown as a piece of evidence.

134
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.610
And you could say, look,

135
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:21.680
ask Nick came out of the woman's stomach or whatever the, um,

136
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:23.780
sample was that you had.

137
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:29.090
There's another completely different way that people in the 19th

138
00:09:29.091 --> 00:09:31.880
century were poisoned by arsenic.

139
00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.550
And that was from the green coloring.

140
00:09:34.551 --> 00:09:38.030
The green pigment that was used in their wallpaper.

141
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.950
This green pigment is a copper salt called Sheila's green.

142
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:47.900
It is made by taking a solution of sodium Mehta last

143
00:09:47.901 --> 00:09:52.610
night, which is colorless and dropping in copper sulfate.

144
00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:00.110
I've done this reaction several times, but I haven't done it for a long time.

145
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:05.060
And I was really surprised quite how beautiful it is saying this

146
00:10:05.061 --> 00:10:06.530
green solid forming

147
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.430
Green was used quite widely. This would have been fine. Except in those days,

148
00:10:37.431 --> 00:10:42.320
people were really frightened of drafts and they used to close

149
00:10:42.321 --> 00:10:45.860
all the windows and doors and have very stuffy rooms,

150
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:50.810
which were not very well heated. So particularly at night when they were asleep,

151
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.370
there was a lot of condensation and mold would grow on the wallpaper.

152
00:10:55.730 --> 00:11:00.470
And so the mold growing on your wallpaper could create a gas

153
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:01.910
containing our snake,

154
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:06.560
which if you were laying asleep in this Ellis room over a period of just one

155
00:11:06.561 --> 00:11:08.510
night would be enough to kill you.

156
00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.240
<v 1>In October 18, 15,</v>

157
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.260
Napoleon Bonaparte was brought a prisoner to the Island of Santalina in the

158
00:11:18.261 --> 00:11:22.460
South Atlantic. Yeah. He was to spend the last six years of his life. Yeah.

159
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:23.870
He died on the 5th of May.

160
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:28.250
1821 examination was made of specimens of hair syndrome being taken from the

161
00:11:28.251 --> 00:11:31.460
head of Napoleon before and after he died,

162
00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.790
the results establish the presence of arsenic.

163
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:37.070
<v 0>My friend, David Jones,</v>

164
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:42.470
who was an expert in really weird chemical facts,

165
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:46.790
wondered whether the stories of Napoleon being poisoned with

166
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:51.650
arsenic by the weekly British could in fact be due to mold on the

167
00:11:51.651 --> 00:11:55.900
wallpaper, in his house, on the Island of St. Halina,

168
00:11:55.901 --> 00:11:57.550
where he was exiled.

169
00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:02.560
And remarkably David managed to get hold of a sample of

170
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.940
Napoleon's wallpaper, which had some green marks on it.

171
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:12.100
And he could analyze this and show that it did indeed contain

172
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:12.963
arsenic.

173
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.740
And there was enough arsenic in Napoleon's wallpaper to explain the arsenic

174
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.540
that had been found in his hair,

175
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.350
but not enough to kill him.

176
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.080
So according to David's experiments,

177
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.020
the British did not poison Napoleon,

178
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.200
but he just felt unwell because of his green wallpaper.

179
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:37.570
The action of mold on arsenic compound was

180
00:12:37.571 --> 00:12:42.100
exploited for real chemistry by an

181
00:12:42.101 --> 00:12:46.570
Australian chemist called Bruce wild and his technician,

182
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:51.670
Paul Gungan, they did a really unique experiment.

183
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:56.080
They got some bread and injected it with an arsenic

184
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.390
compound that was not volatile.

185
00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:03.280
And then put the bread in a large container and let mold grow

186
00:13:03.281 --> 00:13:08.200
on it. The mold converted the arsenic compound into

187
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:12.550
volatile compound gas. Then they led this through to,

188
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:17.740
into a solution and they got a yellow solution of a new complex.

189
00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:22.660
And the reason they use the mold is because unlike human chemists,

190
00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.070
the mold could produce a so-called optically active

191
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:27.820
compounds.

192
00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:32.650
That is a left-handed version of the molecule without the right handed one.

193
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:37.240
Whereas ordinary cameras produced both at the same time and they

194
00:13:37.241 --> 00:13:41.950
published a great paper and they had an extraordinary photo

195
00:13:41.951 --> 00:13:42.731
of Paul,

196
00:13:42.731 --> 00:13:47.230
the technician holding this loaf of bread full of arsenic.

197
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:51.010
I dread to think what their safety assessment looked like.

198
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:55.540
This piece of metal has an extraordinary story about it,

199
00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:59.590
which involves arsenic. When I first came here to Nottingham,

200
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.120
one of my colleagues,

201
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:05.380
Mike was studying the reactions of our snake with liquid

202
00:14:05.381 --> 00:14:07.720
fluorine. If it's done carefully,

203
00:14:07.721 --> 00:14:10.600
this is a nice controlled reaction.

204
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:15.700
You have to do it with the operators cooled in liquid nitrogen.

205
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:20.680
So he was doing the reaction inside the thermos flask that looks

206
00:14:20.681 --> 00:14:21.514
like this,

207
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:26.410
and something went wrong and there was an enormous explosion.

208
00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.610
All that was left of the thermals was the plastic top.

209
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:35.080
And this piece of metal, everything else was distributed around the lab.

210
00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:39.370
But I think the importance of this is to show you that our snake,

211
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:41.920
if you get it in the right state,

212
00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:46.660
or perhaps I should say the wrong state can react very violently.

213
00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:51.830
I went into the lab before it had been cleaned up and this,

214
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.320
because I was just so amazed by it.

215
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.490
And I used to use it when I was teaching about arsenic chemistry.

216
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.180
Apparently Metallica,

217
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.840
Nick can occasionally be found in natural minerals,

218
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:10.250
but usually it's found as compounds. And in our store, we have a sample of,

219
00:15:10.251 --> 00:15:13.880
one of the minerals containing our snake. That's called [inaudible]

220
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:13.880
. It's an arsenic sulfide, which has really very nice red crystals. Unfortunately, as sample has rather small crystals. 

221
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:13.880
But if you look at the Mandarin

222
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:13.880
 microscope, you can see really nice red crystals, which are of arsenic sulfite

223
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:13.880
. And this is probably why ask Nick compounds when then

224
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:13.880
 even in ancient times, because of these brightly colored minerals, while we were filming, Neil found some amazing old papers, 

225
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:13.880
led acetate papers for testing for arsenic

226
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:13.880
. They were labeled 20th of July, 1942 before any of us were born. So we tried these papers out, tried testing them on some of 

227
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:13.880
Neil's mixtures that had made We're

228
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:13.880
 expecting the papers to go black. However, Nothing much happened. We haven't thrown them away because one of you may know how to use these papers, or we may find out some instructions. 

229
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.713
And because Martin doesn't.

230
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:32.950
<v 1>Throw anything away.</v>

231
00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:39.580
<v 0>It is said that our arsenic was discovered by a German Bishop called</v>

232
00:16:39.581 --> 00:16:41.260
Albertus Magnus,

233
00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:46.180
who is buried in the city of cologne in Germany. And about a year ago,

234
00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:50.890
I gave a lecture in cologne and the students took me to see his

235
00:16:50.891 --> 00:16:51.724
grave.

236
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:56.500
And they made a couple of little videos of me looking at it,

237
00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:01.540
not as professional as Brady or James, but still quite fun.

238
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:30.610
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

239
00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:31.181
<v 0>Albertus,</v>

240
00:17:31.181 --> 00:17:36.160
Magnus has real significance in cologne to

241
00:17:36.161 --> 00:17:38.200
current PhD students.

242
00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:43.420
There is a tradition that when they graduate successfully,

243
00:17:43.421 --> 00:17:45.160
when they finish their doctorate,

244
00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:50.250
they go to his statue and they touch his thumb is a sign of good

245
00:17:50.251 --> 00:17:52.170
luck for the future career.

246
00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:09.800
