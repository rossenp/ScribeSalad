1
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.580
<v 1>Is a really quite interesting experiments that we</v>

2
00:00:13.581 --> 00:00:17.270
did some time ago happened quite by chance.

3
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.040
So what happened was that Neil, uh,

4
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.990
tireless technician had to empty some cylinders of

5
00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:30.980
noble gases.

6
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.900
So Particularly Xenon

7
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.030
Krypton, uh, neon, you may think that this is great extravagance,

8
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.020
but when you buy guests in the way that we do,

9
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.080
you pay a rental on the cylinders.

10
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.820
<v 0>Hello, I'm now don't get me helium in my voice.</v>

11
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.430
<v 1>When the cylinders nearly empty,</v>

12
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.440
you're paying much more for renting it than the value of the gas inside.

13
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.720
So eventually you just have to get rid of the last bit of gas if you don't have

14
00:01:05.721 --> 00:01:07.040
an urgent experiment.

15
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.360
So I persuaded Neil to fill some balloons

16
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.710
with neon, Krypton and Xenon,

17
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.230
and to make them all the same size.

18
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.310
And because scientists like to do a control experiment,

19
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.610
he also blew one up with nitrogen.

20
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.830
This all happened in a great hurry. Neil had to empty the cylinders quickly,

21
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.830
Brady wasn't in knotting. Um,

22
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.970
so we filmed it ourselves, not me,

23
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.480
but one of my colleagues, but you will see,

24
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.710
I didn't even have time to put on a tie. When I appear on the film,

25
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.390
what I wanted to do was to demonstrate two different things.

26
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.100
The first thing I wanted to show the difference in density of the

27
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.590
gas is the heavier gas.

28
00:01:57.591 --> 00:02:01.910
Like Krypton should fall much faster, the neon,

29
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.050
which should almost float. And when same, uh,

30
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.490
Neal released all four blue balloons at the same time,

31
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.770
you can see the Xenon does fall quite a lot faster.

32
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.280
<v 0>So if you had like, you know, a feather and a hammer and these sort of things,</v>

33
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.100
that mass is irrelevant and things should fall at the same time.

34
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.850
<v 1>Of course, this is true in a vacuum,</v>

35
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.820
but if you have a balloon,

36
00:02:28.821 --> 00:02:33.800
which is very large compared to its mass air

37
00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:35.720
resistance is important.

38
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.860
So then the weight does become significant.

39
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.240
And if you watch, you can see the neon

40
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.940
falls much more slowly than the Xenon and Krypton.

41
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.820
<v 0>Of course, if you had helium, it would've go on the other way.</v>

42
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.820
<v 1>Yeah, of course. Helium should have gone up. In fact,</v>

43
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.150
neon is light to the narrow and also should have gone up,

44
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.100
but you've got to remember that the balloon also has a weight,

45
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.610
so the neon was more or less neutral.

46
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.490
And so it went down just rather slowly.

47
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.870
Now there was another reason they wanted the balloons filled.

48
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.360
And this is because I really wanted to have a balloon of Xenon

49
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.560
in my office.

50
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.210
I could show to visitors.

51
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.120
And my idea was that the gas in the balloon leaks

52
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:32.350
out also,

53
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:36.550
I thought by a process called diffusion and light

54
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.570
molecules,

55
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.640
like neon diffuse much faster than heavy

56
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:44.290
atoms like CNO.

57
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.630
The reason is that light molecules travel faster.

58
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.090
So the Neo on the banging away at the sides of the balloon all the time,

59
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.300
the Xenon, while traveling slower,

60
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.370
doesn't hit the site so frequently. So it shouldn't go through so fast.

61
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.920
So I expected that the neon balloon would deflate quite quickly,

62
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.960
but the Xenon balloon would stay for a long time and I could show it to

63
00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:17.290
visit us and say, wow, look a balloon of Xenon.

64
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.070
So after the dropping experiment,

65
00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:25.510
the balloons were taken to my office and you can see from the photo,

66
00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:27.730
they were more or less the same size.

67
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.760
The next day I was horrified.

68
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.460
The Xenon balloon had got small. So I ran down and told Neil,

69
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.870
he hadn't filled it up properly and persuade to attempt to fill another one.

70
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.460
I thought he hadn't tied the knot properly at the end of the balloon,

71
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.340
but the next day the same thing had happened.

72
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.130
The Xenon balloon had got small and I was really puzzled.

73
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.690
But then I discovered that my theory was wrong.

74
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.070
In fact, there'd been a paper published exactly a hundred years ago,

75
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.110
which showed the rate at which gases diffuse

76
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.960
through the fabric of rubber balloons.

77
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.010
And they didn't use Xenon because it's so expensive,

78
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:16.960
but they use carbon dioxide,

79
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.560
which has very similar properties to Xenon.

80
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.660
And it turns out that carbon dioxide diffuses

81
00:05:25.661 --> 00:05:28.960
out of a balloon much faster than the hydrogen,

82
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.300
because it dissolves in the rubber and the same must be true for Xenon as

83
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:35.134
well.

84
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.670
I suddenly learnt something that reason that gases come out of

85
00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:41.980
balloons is not just a fusion,

86
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.150
but it's the rate at which they dissolve in the rubber. How does Xenon.

87
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.010
<v 0>Dissolve in rubber what's going on.</v>

88
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.870
<v 1>There? Well, the rubber is, if you like,</v>

89
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.600
like a very viscous liquid,

90
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.220
it's not really a crystalline solid.

91
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.160
And so material can dissolve in the rubber. What do you mean by dissolve?

92
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.700
Well, it is just the same as dissolving in a liquid,

93
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.120
the atoms of Xenon or molecules,

94
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.890
because the molecule has only one atom goes between the chains of

95
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:18.320
the rubber molecules,

96
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.680
just in the same way as it would dissolve in the liquid.

97
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.210
So the Xenon dissolves in the rubber, which is quite thin.

98
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.470
And then it goes through the rubber and comes out the other side,

99
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.430
rather zip would do through three thin film of liquid.

100
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.310
<v 2>I would have big Xenon atom have an easier time desolving than</v>

101
00:06:39.311 --> 00:06:42.280
say a neon atom, which is much smaller.

102
00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.670
<v 1>I think it's because the scene on that term interacts more strongly with</v>

103
00:06:48.671 --> 00:06:50.800
the rubber, uh,

104
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.760
than the neon and therefore energetically.

105
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:59.590
It is favorable for the Xenon to go into the rubber

106
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.000
compared to the neon.

107
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:05.500
So I think that this experiment demonstrates

108
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.680
two things. That's three.

109
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.840
The first thing it demonstrates the difference between a demonstration

110
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.850
where you're showing something that you know is going to happen.

111
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.830
We knew that Xenon was heavier than neon,

112
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:27.940
so we knew it would fall faster. The other part,

113
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:32.890
the size of the balloon turned out to be an experiment.

114
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.630
An experiment is where you do something.

115
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.400
When beforehand you have a hypothesis.

116
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.660
If you'd like a theory,

117
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.700
I had the hypothesis that neon would come out faster than

118
00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:49.534
Xenon.

119
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.770
We did the experiment and showed that it was wrong.

120
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.860
Xenon came out fast to the neon.

121
00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:00.130
<v 2>So it was almost, you intended to do a demonstration that turned into an X.</v>

122
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:05.710
<v 1>Precisely. And then it demonstrated the third thing,</v>

123
00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:10.240
which is chemists or scientists like me.

124
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:15.370
Can't possibly know everything, even though it's a hundred years ago,

125
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.630
since the paper on gases in balloons had been published,

126
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:24.010
I knew nothing about it until I actually seen the effect

127
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:29.260
and then search for papers and found that it was well known.

128
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:34.510
The important thing is that once never too young or too old to

129
00:08:34.511 --> 00:08:38.170
learn things like very high voltage,

130
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.390
you can excite the electrons in the helium and it emits light.

131
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.520
And then with a small spectroscope,

132
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:50.860
you can look at it and see the very yellow line that was detected in the sun

133
00:08:50.861 --> 00:08:51.430
spectrum.
