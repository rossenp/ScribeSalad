00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.010
<v 0>Brady Neil and Darren have done another slightly</v>

2
00:00:05.011 --> 00:00:06.300
strange experiments.

3
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.460
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

4
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.020
<v 0>They decided to cool balloons down balloons containing</v>

5
00:00:15.021 --> 00:00:17.300
hydrogen with liquid nitrogen.

6
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.560
And of course, when you cool the gas,

7
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.130
it contracts and the balloon follows down.

8
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.870
But of course, as the balloon gets smaller, it's weight, doesn't change it,

9
00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:39.410
displaces less air, and it can't float.

10
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.450
And as you warm it up again, it,

11
00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:47.150
it starts expanding displaces more air and eventually raises

12
00:00:47.151 --> 00:00:47.984
up.

13
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.530
And when it started rising up, of course,

14
00:00:54.531 --> 00:00:56.720
they couldn't resist putting a match to it.

15
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.790
But the strange thing to them was when they put a match to this code balloon,

16
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.160
it didn't make as loud a bang it did when they used a

17
00:01:10.161 --> 00:01:10.994
warm balloon.

18
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.530
When you look at the actual footage,

19
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.570
there isn't all that much difference between the flames that you see.

20
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:26.120
<v 1>Bye.</v>

21
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.750
<v 0>At the camera doesn't have a sense of ears as my colleagues,</v>

22
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.810
but the people in the room definitely noticed a difference.

23
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.700
So what was going on? Well,

24
00:01:34.701 --> 00:01:37.910
the obvious explanation is first of all,

25
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.530
that when the balloon is cold, the rubber is not as stretching.

26
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.920
So when you light it, it won't fly away as quickly.

27
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.020
And secondly, that the gas is the lower pressure because it's colder.

28
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.970
So what this means is that the balloon will burst more

29
00:02:01.971 --> 00:02:05.030
slowly and the gas won't expand as fast.

30
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.740
It won't mix with act so quickly with oxygen and therefore you'll get

31
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.940
the same amount of heat, but it will be released more slowly.

32
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.450
So you won't get the big shock wave that makes group.

33
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.450
The big question is how could you test this?

34
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.960
We thought that perhaps you could test it by putting the hydrogen instead of in

35
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.200
the balloon, in the plastic bag,

36
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.140
because the plastic bag will inflate,

37
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.000
but it's not under tension like balloon. So it will burst much more slowly.

38
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.030
So the gas was not really under pressure at all.

39
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.070
After a quick tray with a sandwich bag taken from one of my students,

40
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.080
she had to have her lunch early.

41
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.570
We then tried with a white plastic, which was tied loosely,

42
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.050
but not really sealed. And when you put the match to it,

43
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.120
there was something which we all thought looked a bit like the Hindenburg air

44
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.253
ship crashing,

45
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.350
the bag caught fire. There was a small fireball,

46
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.540
but no explosion in the same way,

47
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.700
Just that the idea of the rubber being stretched and the fact

48
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.680
that it was the gas was lower pressure might explain the absence of

49
00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:35.514
the explosion,

50
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.900
but we hadn't really demonstrated that the oxygen is also needed.

51
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.620
So we started with a second bag this time green

52
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.540
and the green bag was filled with hydrogen,

53
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.760
but the bottom was left completely open so that the air could go in and mix

54
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.470
with the hydrogen. So we had a sort of mixture of hydrogen and oxygen,

55
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.560
much better to burn. And when we let that.

56
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.573
<v 1>One.</v>

57
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.000
<v 0>There was a much more convincing poll,</v>

58
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.180
but still the bag caught fire and just burn.

59
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.673
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

60
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.920
<v 0>It would appear that this rather strange experiment with a balloon and liquid</v>

61
00:04:28.921 --> 00:04:33.630
nitrogen was a combination of two effects that balloon didn't

62
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.460
burst so quickly.

63
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.070
And the hydrogen didn't mix with the air as well because its pressure was lower.

64
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.740
But what was quite interesting is that rather than the balloon,

65
00:04:46.741 --> 00:04:50.340
where little bits disappeared across the room and you rarely find them,

66
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.110
we ended up with two quite artistic pieces of burnt

67
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.240
plastic and they've quite hard.

68
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.980
It makes quite a bang.

69
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.720
I'm sure you've all been at children's parties where the little children burst

70
00:05:06.721 --> 00:05:09.570
into tears when the balloon burst because of the noise.
