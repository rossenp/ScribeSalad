00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:00.540
<v 0>Uh,</v>

2
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.140
we decided to come outside and try and experiment out here while the weather was

3
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.610
nice and dry. What we've got inside that huge beaker is water.

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.180
And we put in an indicator called phenol failing.

5
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.580
So at neutral that's colorless,

6
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.960
but once we put this other chemical in there, sodium hydroxide,

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.370
the sodium hydride will react with the water and it should be a very vigorous

8
00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:27.150
reaction. Um, it produces sodium hydroxide, which is a base,

9
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.990
and that will therefore turn the solution. Uh, pink.

10
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.660
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

11
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.470
<v 2>Sodium hydride is really quite an interesting compound.</v>

12
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.790
I often say that,

13
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.560
but I think sodium hydride is particularly interesting because it

14
00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:52.190
contains the hydride iron, which is H minus,

15
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.920
let me explain here. I have a rather crude model. This is a sodium atom,

16
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.210
and this is a hydrogen atom. And in the sodium atom,

17
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.440
there is one electron, which is in the outer shell.

18
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.750
And in sodium hydride in the solid one of these electrons is

19
00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:14.660
transferred from the sodium to the hydrogen.

20
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.190
So you have sodium plus where the outer electron has been removed.

21
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:20.631
And over here,

22
00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:25.610
you have eight minus that's hydrogen atom when extra electron.

23
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.880
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

24
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.580
<v 2>These irons are in the solid,</v>

25
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.450
and when you dissolve them in water,

26
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.070
what happens is they dissolve? So you get an,

27
00:01:43.071 --> 00:01:46.100
a plus and H minus in solution,

28
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.170
but the hydrogen does not hold onto its electron very

29
00:01:51.171 --> 00:01:52.004
strongly.

30
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.200
And the electron is easily removed by reaction with water.

31
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.420
As they drop the sodium hydride into the water. First of all,

32
00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:03.710
it hits the surface.

33
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.960
Then it begins to dissolve and as it begins to dissolve,

34
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.830
it forms NH plus H minus,

35
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.000
and the H minus can then react with water. Water,

36
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.800
as you know is H2O. If you take H minus plus H2O,

37
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.750
it goes to H two hydrogen gas and OHA minus,

38
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.650
which is the hydroxide Dianne, which is what makes things alkaline.

39
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.180
So we then have a weight minus in the solution.

40
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.160
The H minus can then interact with the fin of Darlene,

41
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.150
which goes from colorless to red or pink,

42
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.600
depending on the concentration. So overall,

43
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.400
what happens when you drop it in,

44
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.600
there is a great puddling as the hydrogen gas comes out and it comes through.

45
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.463
<v 1>Right?</v>

46
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.130
[inaudible].

47
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.130
<v 2>Sometimes it depends on the particular reaction conditions.</v>

48
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.990
The hydrogen can touch fire and you can get big flames. It looks good,

49
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.360
but good chemists shouldn't get big flames.

50
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.240
