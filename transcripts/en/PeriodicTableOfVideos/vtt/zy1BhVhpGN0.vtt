1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.470
<v 0>So today's the chemistry Nobel prize has been announced.</v>

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.730
And for once it's really excited Neil,

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.340
because it's for lithium batteries.

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.250
And so he's gone on a battery Safari.

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.910
Some of you know that Neil is a motorcyclist.

6
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.610
He has an electric motorcycle,

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.330
which in the owner of the Nobel prize, he brought into the land.

8
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.710
<v 1>How did you find out that they won the prize? Well,</v>

9
00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:29.870
I had planned to watch it live,

10
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.530
but I was actually working this morning and I forgot about the announcement.

11
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.490
So somebody came into my office, very excitedly, uh,

12
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.120
telling me the finally the lithium-ion people had got the prize.

13
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.040
It's been awarded to the people who really made lithium-ion batteries,

14
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.840
what they are today and gave us the kind of devices we,

15
00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:51.170
we all take for granted.

16
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.000
<v 0>The batteries on this motorbike are lithium ion</v>

17
00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:59.060
batteries, but they're not what they seem.

18
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.530
If you look inside them. And Neil started in the excitement,

19
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.380
taking it to bits to show us what's inside.

20
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.010
You'll find there is a whole stack of many,

21
00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:12.410
many lithium ion batteries.

22
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.820
And the key point about these batteries is that they are small.

23
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.410
They have a lot of energy in them, and they're very light.

24
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.480
The reason they're lots of batteries is because each battery is

25
00:01:26.481 --> 00:01:28.040
about four volts.

26
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.350
And to drive a motorcycle engine with enough power,

27
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.180
you need a much higher voltage.

28
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.900
So you will have a whole series of batteries in series.

29
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.420
This is much more efficient than low voltage,

30
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.480
where you need very thick wires to take the big current.

31
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.390
<v 1>The way a battery works is effectively.</v>

32
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.160
It shuttles electrons from a negative electrode to a positive

33
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.360
electrode in the batteries that were developed by the prize winners.

34
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.310
You have lithium atoms that release electrons and those electrons

35
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.150
travel through a wire power powering our phone or whatever it is.

36
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:06.860
And at the same time,

37
00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:11.810
the lithium ions that are released travel through an electrolyte and then

38
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.600
recombine with the electrons. At the other side.

39
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.980
<v 0>Neil decided he would try and find a lithium battery,</v>

40
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.220
which he could take to bits. The first battery had found,

41
00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:24.140
had lithium written on it,

42
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
but it was an old fashioned battery,

43
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.760
which not using modern lithium iron technology.

44
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.150
It said lithium [inaudible] chloride.

45
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.300
None of us actually know how it works,

46
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.470
except it's not the right sort as he was sewing it open.

47
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.870
He got really quite a nasty whip of some gas, probably the time chloride,

48
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.000
but this didn't stop Neil taking it to bits and throwing it into water.

49
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.580
<v 1>Stanley was looking up materials that could, as we say, intercalate the lithium.</v>

50
00:02:58.581 --> 00:03:01.860
So when lithium travels through the electrolyte during the,

51
00:03:01.861 --> 00:03:06.340
the battery operation, it intercalate into the positive electrode.

52
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.780
So he was developing materials that could capture this lithium after it was

53
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:14.350
released and then rerelease it. When we recharge the battery,

54
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.390
what happened subsequently was that good enough found a

55
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:24.100
material that was better at reversibly catching this lithium

56
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.050
and releasing it. The early batteries contained lithium metal,

57
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:31.000
which is very highly reactive.

58
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.770
So one of the developments that then came later on,

59
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:38.230
which is really the kind of third part of the prize,

60
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:42.940
if you like is that we realized that we could use

61
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:47.380
graphite to actually house lithium when the batteries fully charged.

62
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.020
So rather than use a piece of lithium,

63
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.650
which gets oxidized or releases its electrons,

64
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.050
we use graphite in which the,

65
00:03:58.051 --> 00:04:02.800
the lithium is stored and that kind of stabilizes the lithium atoms.

66
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.040
<v 0>So finally in desperation,</v>

67
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.560
Neil offered to sacrifice one of the spare batteries from his mobile phone.

68
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.800
The phone only costs Neil five pounds.

69
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.510
That's about $6 and it had five pounds of free calls on it.

70
00:04:18.511 --> 00:04:23.310
So it was a pretty good bargain. And when he started opening the battery,

71
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.970
he cut it in half and using a knife.

72
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.890
He short-circuited the two electrodes and you can see

73
00:04:31.891 --> 00:04:35.430
the sparks, which show the amount of energy that must be in there.

74
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.740
He then started unwrapping it and they think this particular battery is quite

75
00:04:40.741 --> 00:04:41.940
complicated.

76
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.810
It will have obviously the material for both the cathode,

77
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.740
that's the positive electrode and the anode, the negative one,

78
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.480
but none of us could work out exactly what it was.

79
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.160
Neil had wrecked it, pulling it apart, but some of them fixed,

80
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.360
which suggested possibly that there was some lithium there,

81
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.450
but it might just have been electrolysis of the water.

82
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.290
<v 2>We've been following the Nobel prize for many years now.</v>

83
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.470
How do you feel about this one?

84
00:05:10.471 --> 00:05:12.600
This seems like a good chemistry when this time doesn't it?

85
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.590
<v 0>I think it's really good. First of all, it's chemistry. Secondly,</v>

86
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.600
it really fulfills.

87
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.580
Nobel's original will that the price should be for something

88
00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:27.750
that is really useful to humanity, energy,

89
00:05:27.751 --> 00:05:31.020
efficient batteries, batteries that delight and store.

90
00:05:31.021 --> 00:05:36.000
A lot of energy are really important for decarbonizing

91
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.050
our life, allowing us to use energy,

92
00:05:40.051 --> 00:05:43.650
but without discharging so much CO2 into the atmosphere.

93
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.150
<v 1>One of the things that this prize might do is, um,</v>

94
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.100
in the wider community or in the public is perhaps get people excited

95
00:05:53.101 --> 00:05:54.120
about batteries.

96
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.030
And then we can tell people about the new of batteries chemistries that are

97
00:05:59.031 --> 00:05:59.660
coming along.

98
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.590
One of the things that we're working on at the minute is trying to move

99
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.920
towards what we call beyond lithium iron.

100
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.350
So this is the next generation of batteries.

101
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.880
These are the ones that will store much more energy than a lithium-ion battery

102
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.350
could be more potentially. Yeah. Yeah. I might still be in one a chance.

103
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.420
<v 3>And then he plunged the burning lithium into the beaker.</v>

104
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:37.000
I've got this and this is a real Nobel prize

105
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:37.510
metal.
