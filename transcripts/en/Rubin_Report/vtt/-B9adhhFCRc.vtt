00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.300
<v 0>When was the last time you heard of a liquor store owner going up and down the</v>

2
00:00:03.301 --> 00:00:05.340
halls of a high school, trying to sell gin.

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.800
If it's legal and the profits aren't there.

4
00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:12.150
You're not going to have the profit motive for people to go out and sell it. Or,

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.740
um, I ask what when's the last time you ever heard of a vodka addict, uh,

6
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.070
breaking into houses in order to support a vodka habit, you know,

7
00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:23.460
you can make enough money to support it. If it's legal, uh,

8
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.360
when things are illegal, they tend to cost 20 to 25 times higher.

9
00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:31.200
So that's 20 to 25 times as many houses as you have to break into.

10
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.880
<v 1>On the drug part of this. I find this to be a really interesting one because,</v>

11
00:00:40.881 --> 00:00:44.360
you know, I always describe myself as a classical liberal and people always say,

12
00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:46.760
well, Dave, you sound like a libertarian. What is a classical liberal?

13
00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:47.630
And I always say, well, look,

14
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.320
a classical liberal enough in effect is what I would say.

15
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.700
A really sort of a realist libertarian is meaning that I love all the

16
00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:58.670
libertarian ideas, but I understand I can't win all the time.

17
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.440
And I'm going to have to put some,

18
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.250
some guard rails there that that's the way I most simplest way that I would

19
00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:07.490
describe it. So in my book, I talk about the drug war and I,

20
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.170
and I'm for legalizing marijuana. I'm certainly for legalizing, um,

21
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.520
psychedelics. And, and then we can whittle down every little drug,

22
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.650
but I'm not personally for legalizing the seriously hardcore

23
00:01:21.651 --> 00:01:22.010
stuff.

24
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.130
And it's not because I want to put people in jail because of their decisions.

25
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.741
But,

26
00:01:25.741 --> 00:01:30.620
but the simple truth is I know that if someone was cooking meth next door to

27
00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:33.560
me, I know that there's going to be more crime.

28
00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:37.340
And I know that that it's going to be riskier to be out there and you don't want

29
00:01:37.341 --> 00:01:39.110
kids there and the rest of it.

30
00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:44.030
So are you for legalizing absolutely everything with no regulations or is

31
00:01:44.031 --> 00:01:47.270
this a place where you, you find some, some middle ground,

32
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.880
I know you would kick it to the States regardless, but,

33
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.990
but where do you fall on this?

34
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.700
<v 0>I mean, yeah, the States right now have laws on drinking.</v>

35
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.600
And I was appalled when I moved from a state that, you know,

36
00:01:59.601 --> 00:02:01.400
you could drink pretty much anytime you want.

37
00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:05.150
And then I moved to the South and I was shocked when I found out what you can't

38
00:02:05.151 --> 00:02:08.660
buy alcohol on Sunday. You know, what kind of, where did I end up here?

39
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.730
And in fact, we couldn't buy alcohol on Sunday until pretty recently. So, um,

40
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.020
so I, you know, yes, I, even though I don't like those laws,

41
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.830
at least there's some, uh, competition among laws,

42
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.730
unless you get the federal government involved. And by the way, I realized I'm,

43
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.920
I'm gonna kind of leave the topic for just a minute, just to explain real quick,

44
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.730
because a lot of people don't know that, you know, we had,

45
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.860
when I was in school, in fact,

46
00:02:36.861 --> 00:02:40.670
I was a bartender in college because I was in a state where the drinking age was

47
00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:43.370
on the 18. And that's the way it was back then.

48
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.360
Different States had different drinking ages until Elizabeth goal

49
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.640
transportation secretary in the nineties came along, took in, you know,

50
00:02:52.641 --> 00:02:54.860
just like government always does. Federal government always says,

51
00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:58.790
takes in the money and then dangles the highway funds in front of States and

52
00:02:58.791 --> 00:03:01.960
says, do you want your, uh, you want your highway money back?

53
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.140
You're going to have to raise the drinking age. Now we can have it as bait.

54
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.370
You know, maybe 21 is a better drinking age, whatever, but the point is,

55
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.450
it shouldn't be the federal government deciding that it should be the States.

56
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.570
So when I say, okay, let's have the States, you know, you know, we'll,

57
00:03:18.571 --> 00:03:21.490
we'll let the States regulated if they like, I mean,

58
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.330
really let them regulate it, not have the federal government, you know,

59
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:29.890
backdoor in there trying to, um, hold bribes over their heads. So, uh,

60
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.860
they can do what they want. So D really.

61
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.650
<v 1>So you let them do it.</v>

62
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.010
<v 0>Confused what you said,</v>

63
00:03:38.011 --> 00:03:40.710
because you said that you wouldn't legalize the harder drugs,

64
00:03:40.711 --> 00:03:45.330
but then you talked about, you know, having, um, somebody have an, a meth lab.

65
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.510
I mean, I guess as a meth lab, a harder trigger I'm I'm confused.

66
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.460
<v 1>Yeah. Well, well, meaning I wouldn't want, if meth was totally legal,</v>

67
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.770
uh, then I suspect that more meth labs would be popping up. And I know that I,

68
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.910
right now, if someone moved in next door and was cooking meth next to me, I,

69
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.990
we know it's, it's illegal and someone will hopefully do something about it.

70
00:04:06.991 --> 00:04:10.230
Assuming we still have a police department here in Los Angeles, I'm not sure,

71
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.650
but if it was legal, there would be no recourse. And we know what will happen.

72
00:04:13.651 --> 00:04:14.640
Crime will expand,

73
00:04:14.641 --> 00:04:18.300
you'll get shady or people around your property value will go down, et cetera.

74
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.010
<v 0>I see it completely differently because we've got alcohol. Well,</v>

75
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.390
alcohol is legal and I just don't hear of many people making bathtub gin,

76
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.650
but that's part of the problem is when you legalize something or decriminalize

77
00:04:31.651 --> 00:04:36.180
it, however you want to do it is it has to truly be legal. So for instance,

78
00:04:36.181 --> 00:04:39.810
in California, they've legalized marijuana, but they've limited.

79
00:04:39.811 --> 00:04:42.630
The number of people can sell it. They've got all these licensing laws,

80
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.350
you've got to pay all these fees. So there's still underground.

81
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.700
There's still an underground market.

82
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.080
There's still people selling marijuana illegally. So that means the laws.

83
00:04:52.081 --> 00:04:53.850
Aren't right. Uh, again,

84
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.790
when's the last time you heard of anybody selling bathtub gin,

85
00:04:56.791 --> 00:05:00.050
that would cause somebody to go blind. You don't because it's,

86
00:05:00.051 --> 00:05:04.290
it's legal to the point that we go down and we buy it safely. So if,

87
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.590
if meth were legal, there wouldn't be people making it next door.

88
00:05:07.591 --> 00:05:11.220
They'd be making it down at Phillip Morris or whoever. Uh Seagram's you know,

89
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.110
whoever makes, uh, the other drugs.

90
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.320
<v 1>Okay. So I, so I'm not with you there,</v>

91
00:05:16.321 --> 00:05:19.230
but I do understand the line of thinking that that's just fine,

92
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.960
but what would you say? This is where the conservatives,

93
00:05:21.961 --> 00:05:24.990
I think see the libertarian movement as sort of bananas,

94
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.920
because I think this is where conservatives would say, okay, I get freedom.

95
00:05:28.921 --> 00:05:31.050
I get States' rights. I get all that stuff.

96
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.780
But you're telling me that in effect,

97
00:05:33.781 --> 00:05:38.310
if there was enough demand for meth that Philip Morris and

98
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.640
Unilever should start making meth, if the market demands it.

99
00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:44.850
And we know that a society filled with meth is not great.

100
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.920
So the conservatives would take sort of,

101
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.930
we want to conserve sort of a functioning society where the libertarians are

102
00:05:51.931 --> 00:05:55.800
saying it's more of a free for all. Do you think that's like a fair,

103
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.970
it's just sort of like a philosophically different spot?

104
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.610
<v 0>Well, I think they're misguided, uh, first off,</v>

105
00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.400
if you look where marijuana is legal,

106
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.030
you haven't seen increase in marijuana use,

107
00:06:10.031 --> 00:06:13.840
let's say in teenagers and you haven't seen it. Um,

108
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.090
basically abused. You know, I, again, we look at alcohol I'm right.

109
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.970
<v 1>But marijuana is not, marijuana is not highly addictive the way meth or,</v>

110
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.790
you know, some opiates, you know, some of the more hardcore stuff is.

111
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.870
<v 0>Well, alcohol is highly addictive. Tobacco's highly addictive.</v>

112
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.530
Those are very highly active. In fact, our own surgeon general said that, uh,

113
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.580
tobacco was the former surgeon general. I believe it was C Everett Koop,

114
00:06:36.581 --> 00:06:40.840
who said that tobacco was just as, uh, highly addictive as heroin.

115
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.040
So, uh, and, and yet that's legal, but you know,

116
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.030
what we have right now is we've got drugs being illegal.

117
00:06:49.031 --> 00:06:53.680
And so they don't go for help and even look at where it starts. You know, again,

118
00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.010
when was the last time you heard of a liquor store owner going up and down the

119
00:06:57.011 --> 00:06:59.050
halls of a high school, trying to sell gin,

120
00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.510
if it's legal and the profits aren't there.

121
00:07:01.511 --> 00:07:05.860
You're not going to have the profit motive for people to go out and sell it. Or,

122
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.450
um, I asked what, when's the last time you ever heard of a vodka addict, uh,

123
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.780
breaking into houses in order to support a vodka habit. You know,

124
00:07:13.781 --> 00:07:17.170
you can make enough money to support it. If it's legal, uh,

125
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.070
when things are illegal, they tend to cost 20 to 25 times higher.

126
00:07:21.071 --> 00:07:24.970
So that's 20 to 25 times as many houses as you have to break into.

127
00:07:24.971 --> 00:07:28.510
And so I'm looking at it and by the way, I'm not a drug user. Well,

128
00:07:28.511 --> 00:07:33.040
actually I am a bourbon is my drug of choice. Yes,

129
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.990
bourbon is a drug and I got a graduate certificate in drug and

130
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.070
alcohol studies.

131
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:43.330
And I understand that the way our neuro-transmitters work alcohol is actually a

132
00:07:43.331 --> 00:07:47.650
very dangerous drug, much more dangerous than marijuana. Um, but somehow,

133
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.760
somehow I got through the 1970s in high school and college never having tried

134
00:07:51.761 --> 00:07:54.160
marijuana. I got admit, you know, I'm a goody two shoes,

135
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:59.560
but the point here is there's not a profit motive.

136
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.280
You know, w w when people ask me about legalizing drugs,

137
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:08.080
the point is, and they say, well, but I don't use drugs. So I don't care. I say,

138
00:08:08.081 --> 00:08:10.510
but you should care. If you care about crime,

139
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.330
you should care if your kids are in a school.

140
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:18.640
Because right now there's a profit motive to get your kids hooked on drugs and,

141
00:08:18.641 --> 00:08:20.770
and high school kids themselves will say, you know,

142
00:08:20.771 --> 00:08:24.820
it's a lot easier to buy marijuana than it is to buy alcohol. Yeah.

143
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.600
Because alcohol is legal. There's not the profit in there. There's competition.

144
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.940
It's, we've got the free market out there taking care of it.

145
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.940
So how about let's have the free market take care of the other things.

146
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.770
And then if you do have a heroin problem,

147
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:40.630
that's treated as a medical issue and not, uh, uh,

148
00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:41.890
you know, a criminal issue.

149
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:45.160
