1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>You see it on the masks. They say the surgeon general United States said,</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.240
do not buy masks there. They will harm people. If you buy the masks,

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.520
don't buy masks. Then later you have to buy the masks.

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.960
The disease will be spread on surfaces. The disease won't be spread on surfaces.

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.240
The disease will be spread by asymptomatic people.

6
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.850
The disease won't be spread by asymptomatic people, right?

7
00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:20.610
The list goes on and on. And actually it gets to a distinction.

8
00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:21.630
You talk about a lot.

9
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.220
The distinction between say Progressive's are leftists and classical liberals,

10
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:27.810
right? Well,

11
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.340
what the progressive project has been telling us for a hundred years now is

12
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.720
forget about politics.

13
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.280
Forget about debate and persuading your fellow citizens and engaging in

14
00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:40.140
questions and making ethical choices.

15
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.650
Just pick some experts in lab coats.

16
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.620
They are going to find the indisputable answer.

17
00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:48.390
They're going to tell you all how to live your lives.

18
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.670
And even if they contradict themselves the next day,

19
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.560
we just have to do what they say.

20
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:55.020
And I think what we're beginning to learn now is no,

21
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.410
we actually have a right to speak about this too.

22
00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.550
We're not just going to blindly.

23
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.380
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

24
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.330
<v 2>This is the Rubin report. And I'm Dave Rubin.</v>

25
00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:14.630
Don't forget to subscribe to that YouTube channel.

26
00:01:14.631 --> 00:01:17.150
We've got over there and click the notification bell.

27
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.980
And joining me today is the host of the Michael Knowles show on the daily wire

28
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.420
and a best-selling author, Michael Knowles. Welcome to the Rubin report. Dave,

29
00:01:26.421 --> 00:01:29.690
thank you for having me. How is we not done this before?

30
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.850
Something doesn't seem right here.

31
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.330
Like the universe is sort of lining up right now, but how did this not a lie?

32
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.060
I liked that it took a pandemic for us to really do it. I know.

33
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.260
Are we allowed to shake hands? I, you want to shake hands?

34
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.090
I'm going to shake your hand on camera because you know this,

35
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.740
I think with the rest of the world, doesn't know this on super Tuesday,

36
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.670
which was what was that? February was that March it's like March 2nd.

37
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.110
It was a while ago. That was like right at the beginning of Corona. Yeah,

38
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.110
super Tuesday. I'm with you guys at the daily wire,

39
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.640
just as Corona is bubbling up.

40
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.420
You are the last hand that I shook as I was walking out of there.

41
00:02:05.421 --> 00:02:08.750
I shake Shapiro's hand. I shake Klaban's hand whoever else in the crew.

42
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.390
And then I walk out of there. You're the last one that I shake.

43
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.140
And then we went into lockdown the next day. So short of David,

44
00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:17.720
I have not touched another, the last one,

45
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.700
according to the latest medical science, if you ever get Corona, it's my fault.

46
00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:23.870
I think. Well, the best part,

47
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.410
the best part of that is that then it turned out that I guess a few days before

48
00:02:27.411 --> 00:02:29.510
you were at, uh, where were you using?

49
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.050
SeaPak you were at SeaPak and it turned out somebody at SeaPak shook somebody's

50
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.370
hand and I'm like, man,

51
00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:38.750
I'm going to get Corona virus now because NOLs was at sea Pat. It's right.

52
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.010
Shook my hand. But yet we're both here and we're both healthy. We both survived.

53
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.660
<v 0>It's so funny because right after that,</v>

54
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.410
the reason that became a big story at SeaPak is I was there with Senator Cruz

55
00:02:48.411 --> 00:02:52.490
and we were doing this, this live show we're in the green room. And there were,

56
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.580
there were a lot of important people in the administration.

57
00:02:55.581 --> 00:02:58.850
There was like Kellyanne Conway. It was Ronald McDaniel was the head of the GOP,

58
00:02:58.851 --> 00:03:00.580
all in this very small room.

59
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.570
And one guy tested positive for Corona virus.

60
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.680
So all of a sudden you have all these people locking down quarantining for weeks

61
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:09.250
and weeks.

62
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.670
And I thought I've just re ruined the Rubin report because I'm the last guy that

63
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:13.410
he touched.

64
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.400
<v 2>Not only the Rubin report,</v>

65
00:03:14.401 --> 00:03:18.240
if any of this had had the veracity that they told us it was going to have,

66
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.160
right? You would have taken out the daily wire.

67
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.790
You would have taken out half of Los Angeles. And yet we're all here.

68
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.840
<v 0>Well, because we found the cure, you know, we found the cure to coronavirus,</v>

69
00:03:27.841 --> 00:03:30.900
which it turns out is nationwide race, riots, racism.

70
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.430
I thought it might be hydroxy Clark. When I thought it could be,

71
00:03:35.431 --> 00:03:39.000
they maybe get a vaccine. Nope. Turns out a race riots.

72
00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:40.050
That's the cure to the virus.

73
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.020
<v 2>Oh, you're being slightly sarcastic there. You know,</v>

74
00:03:43.021 --> 00:03:46.230
we've had public officials that have said that, that have literally said,

75
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.140
if we get the second wave of Krone,

76
00:03:49.141 --> 00:03:53.790
it will not be because of the disease itself. It will be because of racism.

77
00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:56.070
This is what one of the health commissioners of New York city said.

78
00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.930
<v 0>Not, not just one. There was this,</v>

79
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.700
this letter that came out a couple of weeks ago. I think it was about 1200,

80
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.200
over 1200 public health officials who said, there are,

81
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.240
there are riots and they didn't say right. They said,

82
00:04:09.241 --> 00:04:12.570
there are protests going on right now, peaceful, very peaceful,

83
00:04:12.571 --> 00:04:14.700
social justice protests against racism.

84
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.150
Those should be encouraged from a public health perspective.

85
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.590
But the protests that went on a few weeks before against the lockdowns,

86
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.730
those must be discouraged because they are mostly white. And I, frankly,

87
00:04:26.731 --> 00:04:29.820
I don't even know if that's true. Yeah. And this was the kicker. They said,

88
00:04:29.821 --> 00:04:34.110
from our perspective as scientists, we know that white supremacy,

89
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.880
which is totally a real thing.

90
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.530
White supremacy is a public health threat that exacerbates Corona

91
00:04:40.531 --> 00:04:43.260
virus. This was a shock to me. I didn't,

92
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.510
we don't know that much about the virus, but we do know that.

93
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.150
<v 2>How do you feel being a pundit in the stupidest stuff?</v>

94
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.790
I've been thinking a lot about this.

95
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.040
<v 0>I think this is the best time to be a pundit to be in politics</v>

96
00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.450
because we've been living in this fiction for an actually a number of years now,

97
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.520
which is that there is science, right?

98
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.350
And science with a capital S trademark over the E is you can't argue with

99
00:05:07.351 --> 00:05:09.240
science. Science tells you what to do.

100
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.000
We bow down and pay obese sins to the God of science.

101
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.680
And what we're finding out is a lot of this science is not so certain.

102
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.040
It's actually a little bit more political than all that. I mean,

103
00:05:20.041 --> 00:05:22.170
obviously in coronavirus, they've basically admitted it.

104
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.400
<v 2>You're telling me that the who the world health organization could potentially</v>

105
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.980
occasionally possibly be wrong about things.

106
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.300
<v 0>I would never want to contradict the Chinese communist party. We are on YouTube.</v>

107
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.630
Yes. I know exactly. But this is the.

108
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.960
<v 2>But he, but that sort of thing where it's like, I mean,</v>

109
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.460
because we're so in the same world here,

110
00:05:41.461 --> 00:05:45.240
I mean that we have to believe these people. The second they say something,

111
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.060
even though two weeks later, they say the complete reverse right.

112
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.740
Related to masks or whatever it is.

113
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.280
And then we are doing this on YouTube and I'm sure they're going to suppress the

114
00:05:53.281 --> 00:05:53.851
views on this.

115
00:05:53.851 --> 00:05:57.500
But the simple truth is YouTube said you can't contradict the who,

116
00:05:57.501 --> 00:05:59.360
which contradicts itself all the time. Right?

117
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.430
<v 0>You see it on the masks. They say the surgeon general United States said,</v>

118
00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.880
do not buy masks there. They will harm people. If you buy the masks,

119
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.160
don't buy masks. Then later you have to buy the masks.

120
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.630
The disease will be spread on surfaces. The disease won't be spread on surfaces.

121
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.910
The disease will be spread by asymptomatic people.

122
00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.490
The disease won't be spread by asymptomatic people, right?

123
00:06:18.491 --> 00:06:21.250
The list goes on and on. And actually it gets to a distinction.

124
00:06:21.251 --> 00:06:22.270
You talk about a lot,

125
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.890
the distinction between say Progressive's or leftists and classical liberals,

126
00:06:26.891 --> 00:06:27.724
right?

127
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.290
W what the progressive project has been telling us for a hundred years now

128
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.360
is forget about politics.

129
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.950
Forget about debate and persuading your fellow citizens and engaging in

130
00:06:38.951 --> 00:06:40.780
questions and making ethical choices.

131
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.290
Just pick some experts in lab coats.

132
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.260
They are going to find the indisputable answer.

133
00:06:47.261 --> 00:06:49.030
They're going to tell you all how to live your lives.

134
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.340
And even if they contradict themselves the next day,

135
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.200
we just have to do what they say.

136
00:06:53.201 --> 00:06:55.660
And I think what we're beginning to learn now is no,

137
00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.050
we actually have a right to speak about this too.

138
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.130
We're not just going to blind you.

139
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.690
<v 2>What do you think the psychological underpinning of that is with Progressive's</v>

140
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.200
because I, I get it. I've thought a lot about this. I wrote about this. Like,

141
00:07:08.201 --> 00:07:11.890
what do you think it is about the progressive mind that they pretend they're

142
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.120
anti-authoritarian all the time. And yet they love authoritarian voices.

143
00:07:16.121 --> 00:07:18.930
Actually, all their policies are authoritarian all the,

144
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.940
every time there's a study that that proves what they want.

145
00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:23.080
Then that's the right study.

146
00:07:23.081 --> 00:07:25.660
And everybody else's is the racist study or something like that.

147
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.290
But do you think there is like a psychological reason to it? I do.

148
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.730
<v 0>I think it actually it's, it's a philosophical and a psychological reason,</v>

149
00:07:33.731 --> 00:07:37.570
and it goes back to Carl Marx and it actually goes back to this idea of science.

150
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.880
So if you go all the way back to the word, science,

151
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:41.980
science just refers to knowledge,

152
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.940
it comes from the Latin word for knowing things, right. And yet,

153
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.600
now the word science has been minimized. It's been truncated into this,

154
00:07:49.601 --> 00:07:53.710
a little tiny aspect of material inquiry and empirical inquiry. Right?

155
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.810
So everything else that we have,

156
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.060
we have to say about knowledge is kicked out of that.

157
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.720
And what Mark said was he discovered a science of history,

158
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.000
and this is what progressive say, it's right there in the word,

159
00:08:04.001 --> 00:08:07.720
progressive is we're progressing towards something it's inevitable.

160
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.270
Barack Obama used to always quote Martin Luther King Jr.

161
00:08:10.271 --> 00:08:12.940
Who would always say the arc of the moral universe is long,

162
00:08:12.941 --> 00:08:14.770
but it bends toward justice, basically,

163
00:08:14.771 --> 00:08:19.510
meaning we're inevitably hurdling toward this progressive utopia. And you,

164
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.370
you can stand in the way for a little bit,

165
00:08:21.371 --> 00:08:23.590
but you're not really going to stop it. And so.

166
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.630
<v 2>And don't forget, history will judge.</v>

167
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.030
<v 0>You and you'll be on the wrong side of history. Right?</v>

168
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.620
All of this language basically turns politics into a science.

169
00:08:32.621 --> 00:08:35.560
And the reason it does that is so that you can't disagree with it.

170
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.770
And that's been, the science is always, always right.

171
00:08:38.771 --> 00:08:39.670
You can never disagree with it.

172
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.580
And what we're learning now is that was just an excuse.

173
00:08:42.581 --> 00:08:46.060
That was a facade to cover up their political choices.

174
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:51.040
And so I think the authoritarian impulse there comes because they

175
00:08:51.041 --> 00:08:55.000
know that we're going to paradise. They see the utopia right ahead of,

176
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.460
and so if you stand in the way of utopia, you can only be one of two things,

177
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.660
really evil or extremely stupid. And either way,

178
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:04.890
we shouldn't be listening to you.

179
00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:08.310
And the funny thing about this is they think the word utopia means the best

180
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:11.640
place, but it doesn't mean that the word actually means no place.

181
00:09:11.641 --> 00:09:13.860
It doesn't exist. And I think a lot of people are.

182
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.110
<v 2>Well, there's a semi autonomous zone in Seattle, I think, is,</v>

183
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.930
is there utopia or whatever the hell is going on there?

184
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.440
I don't mind me asking your lady never tells me, okay. You're,

185
00:09:24.441 --> 00:09:27.440
you're young fella out there in the political world.

186
00:09:27.441 --> 00:09:31.310
And I always find it interesting when, when I meet younger conservative.

187
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.590
So especially now at college, when I meet younger conservatives,

188
00:09:33.591 --> 00:09:35.360
because I think you, at least,

189
00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:39.080
although I do think this is changing now for at least a decade,

190
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:40.640
really more than a decade,

191
00:09:40.641 --> 00:09:44.450
probably a couple of decades to be a young conservative was like, you're,

192
00:09:44.451 --> 00:09:48.380
you're just sort of this dorky, stuffy, whatever. You're a nerd. You, you,

193
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:51.260
you know, you care about numbers. You don't know anything about culture.

194
00:09:51.261 --> 00:09:52.160
You're not funny.

195
00:09:52.161 --> 00:09:56.630
You don't like comedy or any of these things where you always a

196
00:09:56.631 --> 00:10:00.980
conservative and how do you see that sort of changing right now?

197
00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.500
Because I really see it changing.

198
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:04.070
<v 0>I see it. I mean, I think we're,</v>

199
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.260
we're in the midst of it changing pretty radically.

200
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.600
I basically came out of the womb.

201
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.340
<v 2>Smoking cigars, parted hair.</v>

202
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:14.840
