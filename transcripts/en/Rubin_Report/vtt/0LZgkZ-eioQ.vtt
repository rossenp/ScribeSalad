00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.650
<v 0>I think one of the sad things, but the reality is over the past 20,</v>

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.550
25 years is the Republicans have shown themselves to be very good at winning

3
00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:11.400
elections. Maybe not in this particular case for the white house,

4
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:15.930
but in general, they win elections and very bad at fighting the culture Wars.

5
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.180
And it's unfortunate because now the Democrats control the

6
00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:26.130
media, Hollywood academia, big tech,

7
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.350
and half the country doesn't feel represented at all in

8
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.860
almost all of the information that comes back to them publicly.

9
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:43.370
<v 1>What do you think.</v>

10
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.280
<v 2>The big tech element then also that, you know,</v>

11
00:00:46.281 --> 00:00:50.600
going forward that at least, even though they did nothing, I mean,

12
00:00:50.601 --> 00:00:53.540
I kept saying this the whole time you guys are having these hearings and it's

13
00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:56.390
great to see Ted Cruz who I totally like and respect.

14
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.190
It's great to see him grill Jack,

15
00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:00.590
but you guys are doing it six days before an election.

16
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.400
And we're pretending that this is in theater. Are you worried that okay,

17
00:01:04.401 --> 00:01:07.820
Trump was sort of the last thing that was stopping big tech from doing whatever

18
00:01:07.821 --> 00:01:11.090
it might want to do. I don't know what exactly what it wants to do,

19
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.180
but now without that threat of we're going to regulate you, whatever it might,

20
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.670
you know, break you up, stuff that I don't particularly want them to do. Uh,

21
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.280
are you worried that they're just going to go all in and,

22
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.600
and silence the real resistance, which will be the remaining freethinkers?

23
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.090
<v 0>Yes, I am worried about that. I don't have the solution to that either. I,</v>

24
00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:34.580
I am worried. I think one of the sad things,

25
00:01:34.581 --> 00:01:36.740
but the reality is over the past 20,

26
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.640
25 years is the Republicans have shown themselves to be very good at winning

27
00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:43.490
elections. Maybe not in this particular case for the white house,

28
00:01:43.491 --> 00:01:48.020
but in general, they win elections and very bad at fighting the culture Wars.

29
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.300
And it's unfortunate because now the Democrats control the

30
00:01:53.301 --> 00:01:57.290
media Hollywood, um, academia,

31
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.330
big tech and half the country doesn't feel represented at

32
00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:07.250
all in almost all of the information that comes back to them publicly,

33
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.620
like sports forgot to mention them.

34
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.940
So you turn on the television and watch a sports game or get the news or watch

35
00:02:13.941 --> 00:02:17.450
the Oscars or the VMs, whatever it is.

36
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.770
And now you're getting woke is shoved down your neck.

37
00:02:21.771 --> 00:02:24.470
And you're being told you're a racist. If you happen to be a Republican,

38
00:02:24.471 --> 00:02:25.640
you like Trump, or even just,

39
00:02:25.641 --> 00:02:30.140
if you're a Republican these days and you send out a tweet that is

40
00:02:30.141 --> 00:02:34.820
totally legitimate and maybe just opinionated or a news story being

41
00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:39.080
reported by that New York post censored, censored, censored, you know,

42
00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:42.950
your viewpoints or you're being told they're bad by everyone that has control of

43
00:02:42.951 --> 00:02:46.820
the public microphones. And I do think at least people could be like, Hey,

44
00:02:46.821 --> 00:02:49.130
am I insane? And is everything. I think

45
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.020
it's a problem. Now I think big tech is part of the problem.

46
00:02:54.021 --> 00:02:57.710
I really wish we would see somebody like Peter teal, you know, who, you know,

47
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.470
he's going to, to actively create a new Twitter and a new Facebook. And like,

48
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.810
there needs to be a real,

49
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.190
other digital forum out there that represents the other half of the country.

50
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.400
Cause I just don't think they've got much of a future on the existing platforms.

51
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.960
<v 2>Well,</v>

52
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.850
the irony is if Trump loses and then it finally gives him the impetus to be

53
00:03:17.851 --> 00:03:20.640
like, okay, I'm going to another platform or I'm starting my own platform.

54
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.470
That's how the platform will work. Right? Like that ultimately would be it. No,

55
00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:26.850
you don't, you don't think that would be enough.

56
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.000
<v 0>No, I think that'll be like, I mean, with all due respect,</v>

57
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.420
Sean Hannity starting his own network, like, you know,

58
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:34.403
you know what you're going to get.

59
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.050
You're not going to get real analysis that now that's.

60
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.480
<v 2>Well, I don't mean, I don't mean you'll get analysis. I mean,</v>

61
00:03:39.481 --> 00:03:41.340
if Trump is just like, all right, I'm going,

62
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.510
I'm going to parlor or I'm going to locals or wherever that it would be like

63
00:03:45.511 --> 00:03:48.810
everyone would go there just because he's still the show in a way.

64
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.200
I don't mean that he's going to create some non-partisan network.

65
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.150
<v 0>You can not like conservative media is well-represented in the digital world.</v>

66
00:03:57.151 --> 00:04:00.540
I get that. But when it comes to these main, the main platforms out there,

67
00:04:00.541 --> 00:04:03.360
when it, I mean, Facebook is, it gives a little bit more play, but they're,

68
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.660
they're censoring a lot of stuff too. But if you could have a real,

69
00:04:06.661 --> 00:04:08.610
and I know there's parlor, I'm on parlor, but it's just,

70
00:04:08.611 --> 00:04:12.090
it's not what Twitter is. And I don't know that it's going to be,

71
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.640
you need a real player with a lot of money to,

72
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.120
to create the platform and back it. And somebody with a spine of steel,

73
00:04:18.121 --> 00:04:22.440
like Rupert Murdoch to say, I don't need to be loved at the cocktail parties.

74
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.840
I'm going to let this be a real forum for mainstream conservative

75
00:04:27.841 --> 00:04:31.170
thought. In other words, we don't need Alex Jones on there. Okay.

76
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.650
But like Dave Rubin does not need to get censored. Right.

77
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.830
And I that's my only thought because I,

78
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.270
you're not going to change Jack Dorsey. You're not going to change Facebook.

79
00:04:42.271 --> 00:04:45.900
You're not going to change these big tech organizations for whom it's like

80
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.700
deeply ideological. They think it's the difference between good and evil.

81
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.620
You know, it's not just about getting Biden, elected.

82
00:04:52.621 --> 00:04:56.100
It's about silencing the rest of these resists.

83
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.460
Did you see that clip from sunny Hostin on the view? Yeah.

84
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.223
<v 2>Unbelievable.</v>

85
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.060
<v 0>That that embodies how they think that the left wing and I don't even mean</v>

86
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.680
progressive. I know you used to be one.

87
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.770
Most professors I know are totally normal and mainstream and they don't believe

88
00:05:10.771 --> 00:05:11.730
in any of this nonsense.

89
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.470
It's the quote left with a capital L who are insane and the way they see the

90
00:05:16.471 --> 00:05:18.180
other half of the country and sunny Hostin,

91
00:05:18.181 --> 00:05:23.010
just put it on display where it was like these at least half the

92
00:05:23.011 --> 00:05:26.760
country. I'm not going to say they're racists. Yeah, whatever it is,

93
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.590
that's either racist. But at least half the country voted for him.

94
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.950
Net was standing his racism, his sexism, racism,

95
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.960
xenophobia has transphobia.

96
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.970
And then another woman on the panel, Sarah, I don't remember her name,

97
00:05:41.971 --> 00:05:44.520
but she was like, how can you say that? You know, people vote in their own.

98
00:05:44.521 --> 00:05:46.890
Self-interest all the time, pocket book issues. And so on.

99
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.470
It doesn't make them bad. It doesn't make them racist.

100
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.450
And the response was no, because this is about we,

101
00:05:54.451 --> 00:05:59.420
the people and we are supposed to behave as a collective and do what

102
00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:04.160
is right. It's one of those things day. I was like, Oh my God, I wish so badly.

103
00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:06.140
For the first time in my life that I were sitting on the view,

104
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.830
I would have loved to said to her, I get it. Totally. And just out of curiosity,

105
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:15.470
I'm wondering, cause like there's a lot of people who really feel like,

106
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.910
for example, um,

107
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.220
abortion is murder and it's actually killing babies and that's wrong.

108
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.670
And what would be right would be to ban it outright.

109
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.120
And if you don't support that, you are on the wrong side,

110
00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:31.850
you're in favor of murder. And we,

111
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:35.540
the people respond to you to behave as a collective, right?

112
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.070
Like I could go on for, you know, give me five other examples, like eat outrage.

113
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.230
And by the way, let's look at the Southern border. You know,

114
00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:45.290
the people down there who have had family members killed by people illegally

115
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:50.090
coming across with drugs and weapons who have lost jobs to people who are here

116
00:06:50.091 --> 00:06:51.230
unlawfully in the country.

117
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.580
They have real reasons for wanting a great border wall and for cracking down on

118
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.030
illegal immigration. And if you don't support it,

119
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.960
you're the one who doesn't care about life and the well-being of your fellow

120
00:07:02.961 --> 00:07:07.640
citizens and read the people who died and made her

121
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.800
King of we, the people. Right.

122
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:10.923
<v 2>So do you think,</v>

123
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.790
do you think they'll ever stop that thing like that in many ways,

124
00:07:15.791 --> 00:07:19.150
what you just described there? That is the thing that most,

125
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:24.250
the rest of us are fighting to make it about Sonny, but that thing,

126
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.500
and it's been so successful and,

127
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.800
and as we're talking potentially is about to dethrone Donald Trump,

128
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.600
why would they stop doing it?

129
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.170
<v 0>They're not going to, they're not going to. And I,</v>

130
00:07:35.171 --> 00:07:38.500
I agreed with the headlines this week that said woke ism was Delta blow during

131
00:07:38.501 --> 00:07:40.420
this election because he saw, you know, his numbers.

132
00:07:40.421 --> 00:07:43.090
As you pointed out with all these minority groups, go up, people,

133
00:07:43.091 --> 00:07:45.610
the minority groups like him more than they used to,

134
00:07:45.611 --> 00:07:48.820
not less like four years of ubiquitous media coverage,

135
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:51.850
telling them he's awful racist, bigot, all this stuff.

136
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:56.620
And that they're awful if they like it. So that didn't work. Oh. And by the way,

137
00:07:56.621 --> 00:07:58.750
I mean, even just today, there was a Congressman,

138
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.200
a democratic Congresswoman who was saying, uh, defund,

139
00:08:02.201 --> 00:08:05.140
the police killed us, killed us.

140
00:08:05.141 --> 00:08:07.600
That is why we went down in the house instead of up.

141
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.270
And if we don't abandon that ridiculous messaging,

142
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:14.680
we're going to see a bloodbath in two years. So woke is, um, you know,

143
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.160
that the messaging was proven to be a failure when it comes to electoral

144
00:08:18.161 --> 00:08:21.610
politics, but that won't deter them. That's not going to stop anything.

145
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.450
But for the reasons I was saying, it's ideological,

146
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.620
it makes them feel like better people. So, um,

147
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:31.090
I don't know if it's their guilt,

148
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:35.230
if it's just the virtue signaling makes them feel great about themselves in bed

149
00:08:35.231 --> 00:08:38.530
at night when they judge other people and decide they're all bad.

150
00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:40.510
So we're going to have to deal with it.

151
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:44.590
And the people who don't believe in this BS culture,

152
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.510
and there's so many people in the center, right,

153
00:08:46.511 --> 00:08:49.120
who don't either look at the Harper's Le leather letter,

154
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.120
look at people like Andrew Sullivan who hated Trump, but you know,

155
00:08:52.121 --> 00:08:54.280
he's completely taken a stand against this baloney.

156
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.230
They're going have to speak up. They're the people who are against it.

157
00:08:58.231 --> 00:08:59.250
I know they're afraid.

158
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.450
I know you can get fired now for the most ridiculous reasons. Trust me, I know

159
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.910
we're going to have to start taking risks. Otherwise we're all going to go down.
