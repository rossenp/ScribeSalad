00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.210
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.770
<v 1>Hello voters. Non-voters dead voters.</v>

3
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.340
People who voted twice and everyone else I'm Dave Rubin.

4
00:00:16.341 --> 00:00:18.890
This is the Rubin report direct message for

5
00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:21.620
November 12th, 2020.

6
00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:26.150
And you may notice that I'm in a slightly different situation than usual.

7
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.710
I am live right now at the blaze TV studios here in Dallas, Texas.

8
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.590
I actually traveled folks for the first time.

9
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.340
Since February last February, I was in Florida.

10
00:00:37.341 --> 00:00:40.460
I came home from Florida and then I didn't realize I wasn't going to travel for

11
00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:43.910
the next nine months considering I usually do three or four, uh,

12
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.540
speaking gigs or college gigs or whatever it might be a month. Uh,

13
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.220
then of course lockdown happened and I have been in Los Angeles every day since

14
00:00:52.221 --> 00:00:56.870
around February 21st and last night I got on an

15
00:00:56.871 --> 00:01:01.100
airplane and I flew to Dallas, Texas, and here I am,

16
00:01:01.101 --> 00:01:04.460
I made it of alive. I'm okay. I even checked into a hotel.

17
00:01:04.461 --> 00:01:05.450
It's incredible stuff.

18
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.930
You can actually still travel despite everything going on. Uh, so yeah,

19
00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:11.030
I'm thrilled to be here with the blaze people. I've,

20
00:01:11.031 --> 00:01:14.900
they've got a great team and uh, we're going to do our show as normal.

21
00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:19.250
I've got three stories for you. Obviously there's a ton going on, uh,

22
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.560
in the world right now and with the election and everything else,

23
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.690
but just real quick, I wanted to talk about just,

24
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.190
just traveling again and everything else, because I went to, uh, lax,

25
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.230
Los Angeles international airport yesterday,

26
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.750
and after not traveling for so long,

27
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.990
being in a pretty much empty airport.

28
00:01:35.991 --> 00:01:38.510
I don't know how many of you guys have traveled since this whole,

29
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.900
whole thing started, but to be in an empty airport where all of the,

30
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.820
the restaurants were closed,

31
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.480
actually the bookstore was open at the American airlines terminal.

32
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.540
And I saw don't burn this book in a bookstore for the first time.

33
00:01:50.541 --> 00:01:51.374
Believe it or not,

34
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.710
the book came out in April and I have not been to a bookstore even.

35
00:01:54.711 --> 00:01:56.810
I've seen it in target a couple of times,

36
00:01:56.811 --> 00:02:00.020
but I actually got to see my book in a bookstore, which was pretty great.

37
00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:03.980
It was right next to Ben Shapiro's book, you know, that Shapiro guy. Um,

38
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.360
but just seeing all of these people, you know, everyone's in masks,

39
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.150
everyone's standing away for themselves, everyone. I mean,

40
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.030
I don't know if I was noticing this more than usual or it's happening more than

41
00:02:14.031 --> 00:02:18.050
usual or what, but everybody just staring at their phone, right?

42
00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:21.230
Like there's cause you can not talking to anybody. So it's eerily silent.

43
00:02:21.231 --> 00:02:23.750
It felt very dystopian. Uh,

44
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.260
but in any event got on the plane and it turned out that I was sitting next to a

45
00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:31.100
pilot who was just, uh, doing some traveling, not actually flying the plane,

46
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.310
who was a fan of mine. We had, we had a great chat and it's just more,

47
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.190
it's further proof that there are people out there that are,

48
00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:39.410
that are waking up to some of this stuff. Uh,

49
00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:42.410
and then I went to a hotel where I had to wear a mask in the lobby,

50
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.650
but then when I sat down at the restaurant, I could take the mask off.

51
00:02:45.651 --> 00:02:49.250
And then when I got up from the table, then I had to put the mask back on.

52
00:02:49.251 --> 00:02:53.060
I did not wear a mask in my hotel room and here we are. Okay guys.

53
00:02:53.061 --> 00:02:55.730
So the three stories that we're going to cover today, first,

54
00:02:55.731 --> 00:03:00.460
I'm going to cover a couple things going on election wise, uh, on the Twitter,

55
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.270
you know, about that Twitter machine. Uh, but the secretary of state of Arizona,

56
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.810
who's going to be in charge of the recount and everything else going on there.

57
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.790
And the results tabulating, the final results.

58
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.540
She is not a fan of Donald Trump and she has the tweets to prove it. And yes,

59
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.100
it involves the N word Nazi. Of course. Could I do a story without, uh,

60
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.950
somehow someone calling Trump a Nazi? I don't think so. So we're,

61
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.660
we're going to cover that. And then some tweets by, uh, Joe Biden's potential,

62
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.520
uh, chief of staff who has in the past claim that elections were rigged, uh,

63
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:33.790
and then Donald Trump just tweeted something in all caps that we definitely have

64
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:35.530
to cover. So we're going to get to that. Uh,

65
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.020
then we're going to talk about these new New York curfews.

66
00:03:38.021 --> 00:03:40.990
I have just had it where the Andrew Cuomo, as you guys know,

67
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:43.300
I've only lived in New York and Los Angeles,

68
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:45.940
which is a very bizarre thing because everyone that likes me lives in the middle

69
00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:49.210
of the country, I should clearly be living in Idaho or something. Um,

70
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.320
but there are new regulations, uh, in New York for bars, restaurants, gyms,

71
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:57.100
and all sorts of other stuff. So we're gonna get into that. And, uh,

72
00:03:57.101 --> 00:04:00.040
and then finally the story is a little bit of an offshoot of what's going on,

73
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.100
but I think you'll see why I want to cover it. Uh,

74
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.790
university of Haberford or Haverford college in Pennsylvania,

75
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.740
a bunch of students, uh,

76
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.180
basically have accomplished a list of demands that they want the

77
00:04:13.181 --> 00:04:14.500
university to adhere to.

78
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.480
And it involves all that photo diversity stuff and fake tolerance and the rest

79
00:04:19.481 --> 00:04:22.750
of it that we talk about all the time. And I thought that would be a little,

80
00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:25.300
a little break from just the pure political stuff.

81
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.970
But it does seem that woke ism.

82
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.780
Ain't leaving the colleges as easily as it might. Uh,

83
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.340
but before I get to all of that, guys, I want to talk to you about Glint.

84
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.180
Okay guys, I've got my Glint card right here. I know this is a mock-up card.

85
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.320
So you can't look at my numbers and take my Glint money. But Glen is really,

86
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:49.060
it's a really fantastic system that you can buy and sell gold.

87
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.390
You can then use your card to make purchases virtually anywhere.

88
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:53.500
I showed you guys yesterday,

89
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.550
I bought a brand new basketball on amazon.com through this, this morning,

90
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.870
I went on nike.com and I bought myself some new sneakers.

91
00:05:01.871 --> 00:05:05.650
So we'll debut those new sneakers at about a week. My new kicks, uh,

92
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.900
but you can pay in gold or in cash.

93
00:05:07.901 --> 00:05:12.220
You can transfer back and forth super easily. And we, I don't have to tell you,

94
00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:14.440
we live in some crazy times guys. So if you're,

95
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.900
if you're a little nervous about what's going to happen to the dollar,

96
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:21.730
then obviously gold is a great way of having a little bit of financial

97
00:05:21.731 --> 00:05:24.280
security. So check it out. It's just super easy.

98
00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:27.760
You get the card and it operates basically like your debit card and within the

99
00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:29.320
app, you just Sue, you just choose.

100
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.720
Am I going to pay with gold or am I going to pay, uh,

101
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.900
out of my normal bank accounts? And you go from there. It's really fantastic.

102
00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:35.650
So take a look.

103
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.000
You guys can sign up for free@glintpay.com slash Rubin,

104
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.360
and you can get some more information and start purchasing gold today.

105
00:05:43.361 --> 00:05:47.770
That's Glint pay.com/rubin. And now back to me,

106
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.040
okay guys, let's, let's talk about the latest with the election.

107
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.840
I want to pull up some tweets by the secretary of state of Arizona.

108
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.530
Her name is Katie Hobbs,

109
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.330
and these are a couple of tweets that she had from 2017. Uh, this is Katie hub,

110
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:03.260
secretary States.

111
00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:06.350
I remember this is the woman that will be in charge of what happens with the

112
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:09.320
election in Arizona. And in August of 2017,

113
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:13.970
she said real Donald Trump has made it abundantly clear that he's more

114
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:18.410
interested in pandering to his Neo Nazi base than being

115
00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:22.310
president of the United States for all Americans. And, uh,

116
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.010
actually just a few days before that she had this gym,

117
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:30.050
she said the president is on the side of the freaking Nazis.

118
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.330
Don't just say stuff, do something. And she used all caps there.

119
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.910
So let's, let's unpack this for a little bit. Now,

120
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.660
the cries of Nazis and everyone who disagrees with you as a racist and a

121
00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:44.360
homophobe and a bigot. Okay. We're I think, uh,

122
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.740
if you've been watching this show long enough,

123
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.520
we're all kind of past the point where any of that has any validity. Um,

124
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.270
but there is some validity to the idea that the woman.

125
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.160
<v 2>Who is in charge.</v>

126
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.540
<v 1>Now of what will happen with Arizona's election results, the secretary of.</v>

127
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.520
<v 2>State of Arizona clearly.</v>

128
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.070
<v 1>Has some level of Trump derangement syndrome and clearly thinks Trump is a Nazi.</v>

129
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.880
Now, do you think that might just, you know,

130
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.710
I know everyone's a conspiracy theorist these days,

131
00:07:11.711 --> 00:07:15.910
but do you think that that might affect her ability to be impartial when it

132
00:07:15.911 --> 00:07:19.720
comes to recounts or tabulating results correctly or whatever it might be?

133
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.770
I think it might. It just might. Right. Does that, does that make me tin,

134
00:07:23.771 --> 00:07:27.400
foil hat, Alex Jones, the frogs are turning everybody gay. I'm not sure,

135
00:07:27.401 --> 00:07:28.930
but I think there's something there.

136
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.040
This is the type of thing by the way that the mainstream media refuses to talk

137
00:07:33.041 --> 00:07:34.450
about. Right? So it leaves.

138
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.370
<v 2>The YouTubers.</v>

139
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.370
<v 1>And the folks here at the blaze and the daily wire and all of these other places</v>

140
00:07:39.371 --> 00:07:42.820
and me and Crowder and everybody else to talk about these things, because it,

141
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.820
that what I just showed you there, her comments in and of themselves,

142
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.540
they're obviously not evidence of fraud, just like that, right?

143
00:07:49.541 --> 00:07:52.240
They're not evidence that she necessarily is going to do something,

144
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.920
but it is something that colors the picture. And, you know, I mean, this is,

145
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:57.940
this is the part, and this is,

146
00:07:57.941 --> 00:08:01.450
what's so dangerous about what the left has done over these last couple of years

147
00:08:01.451 --> 00:08:04.780
by calling everybody Nazis and bigots. If,

148
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.990
if she's looking at these numbers at the end and it's like, Whoa,

149
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.360
these things are pretty close, but Trump, Trump did.

150
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.460
When do you think it would be out of character or even a crazy estimation to

151
00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:20.290
think that she might do something to stop the man that is leading the

152
00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:22.510
Nazis? Like, do you think that that's crazy,

153
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.780
but this is what we've been reduced to. And by the way, it's not just her, the,

154
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:30.070
the, uh, attorney general of Pennsylvania Shapiro.

155
00:08:30.071 --> 00:08:32.980
I've mentioned them a few times, no relation to Ben Shapiro. As far as I know,

156
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.930
he tweeted out about four days before the election that Trump will lose. Well,

157
00:08:37.931 --> 00:08:40.720
how did he know Trump was going to lose four days before the election?

158
00:08:40.721 --> 00:08:43.690
And now we've got some weird stuff going on in Pennsylvania,

159
00:08:43.691 --> 00:08:45.640
in Philadelphia specifically.

160
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:49.840
So if you have partisan people that are in charge of the apparatus of these

161
00:08:49.841 --> 00:08:52.420
States, you got a problem on your hand.

162
00:08:52.421 --> 00:08:55.890
And that's one of the things that we're going to have to keep discussing over

163
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:58.530
the next couple of weeks, because the mainstream media just,

164
00:08:58.531 --> 00:09:02.340
they just won't touch it. As I always say, if you guys would just do your job,

165
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:05.400
I'll find something else to do. I want it to be in the NBA. Okay.

166
00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:09.390
I'd like to make that dream a reality. As I said, I just got a basketball and,

167
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.200
and I'm getting do kicks where my Glint card. So come on, people help me out.

168
00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:14.880
You know what I mean? Let me do something else for a living,

169
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.840
but I want to show you two other tweets that are important. So one of them, uh,

170
00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.240
is a tweet from a couple of years ago. This is from, uh,

171
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.720
actually July of 2014.

172
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:29.670
And this is Ronald Klein and Ronald Klein. We can throw that tweet up there. Uh,

173
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:34.260
he is responding to an article in Vox and the article in Vox,

174
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.123
as you can see,

175
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:40.350
it says that 68% of Americans think that elections are rigged.

176
00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:43.890
Now just very quickly on Vox. You guys know, I do not like Vox.

177
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.760
I find them to be awful as reclined who, uh, runs Vox.

178
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.840
I don't think it's an honest actor. He's, he's written some pieces about me.

179
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:54.150
Um, and, and the type of things that,

180
00:09:54.151 --> 00:09:57.030
that I do here and what the things that I'm talking about and all of that stuff.

181
00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.660
Well, there's the article. 68% of Americans think elections are right now.

182
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.640
It doesn't even matter whether that's true or not,

183
00:10:02.641 --> 00:10:04.440
or whether Vox is doing actual research there.

184
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.140
The contents of the article actually are completely irrelevant.

185
00:10:07.141 --> 00:10:10.980
You see the headline there and we live in an odd time where the headline sorta

186
00:10:10.981 --> 00:10:13.830
means more than the story. Well, well, Ronald client, again,

187
00:10:13.831 --> 00:10:16.560
he is potentially the chief of staff.

188
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.010
So basically running the white house for Joe Biden. Well,

189
00:10:20.011 --> 00:10:21.270
let's look at his response,

190
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:26.250
his response that's because they are all right.

191
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.490
You got that guys. That's what Ronald Klein is saying.

192
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.510
That that's because they are meaning 68% of Americans think elections are rigged

193
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.660
his response. That's because they are.

194
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.820
So the chief of staff of the potentially incoming president thinks

195
00:10:41.821 --> 00:10:44.460
that the elections are rigged. He might be right,

196
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.520
but it might not be for the reason that he thinks nor the election that he

197
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:51.600
thinks. So these are just things, again, that, that color what's going on here,

198
00:10:51.601 --> 00:10:53.730
but let's go to the most important tweet of the day.

199
00:10:53.731 --> 00:10:56.790
I just saw this about an hour ago. This is that, that Donald Trump guy,

200
00:10:56.791 --> 00:11:00.030
you guys have heard of him, right? Uh, and he did it in all caps. So, you know,

201
00:11:00.031 --> 00:11:01.320
it's something, uh,

202
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:05.730
report dominion and dominion is the software company that many of these States

203
00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:07.620
used to run. Their elections.

204
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:12.720
Dominion deleted 2.7 million Trump votes nationwide

205
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.670
data analysis finds 221,000 Pennsylvania

206
00:11:17.671 --> 00:11:20.670
votes switched from president Trump to Biden

207
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:25.830
941,000 Trump votes deleted States using dominion

208
00:11:25.831 --> 00:11:30.630
voting system switched 435,000 votes from Trump

209
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:35.220
to Biden. And this is based on reporting. He tags the journalist there.

210
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:37.830
That was on OANN now. Okay.

211
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.190
First off he's using caps. So, you know,

212
00:11:41.191 --> 00:11:43.950
Trump really means it when he's using caps. Um,

213
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:47.400
I cannot comment on the veracity of that claim.

214
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:49.950
I cannot sit here and tell you that that is true.

215
00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.880
What I can tell you is that this would be a very curious

216
00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:58.450
move by Trump, if it was not true. So let's, let's play it out here.

217
00:11:58.451 --> 00:12:01.930
So the not true version is that's not true, it's fabricated.

218
00:12:01.931 --> 00:12:06.700
And he just went all in. He just went all in on the lies, all caps.

219
00:12:06.701 --> 00:12:08.500
He picked specific numbers.

220
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:11.350
He talked about the S the boating software and the whole thing.

221
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:15.010
And he's going all in to get all of his people crazy.

222
00:12:15.011 --> 00:12:17.350
That would be the dishonest version of this. Now,

223
00:12:17.351 --> 00:12:19.570
that seems very hard for me to believe right.

224
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:22.420
That he would do something so specific. It's one thing to say, Oh,

225
00:12:22.421 --> 00:12:25.990
the election was rigged, or, you know, we're, we're trying to find votes here.

226
00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:27.610
Or the attorney general of this state is,

227
00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:31.690
is an anti-Trump or those are all sort of more vague generalities that I think

228
00:12:31.691 --> 00:12:32.140
you can,

229
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:36.520
you can talk about in a way that doesn't like really pin you down to a direct

230
00:12:36.521 --> 00:12:39.970
lie. If you think what Trump is doing is like that, right?

231
00:12:39.971 --> 00:12:42.790
They're giving us the numbers, telling us the software,

232
00:12:42.791 --> 00:12:46.270
saying this amount were deleted. This amount switched from Trump to Biden.

233
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:51.100
That is a pretty direct statement that if he does not have evidence for

234
00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.080
that could be the nail in the coffin.

235
00:12:53.081 --> 00:12:57.670
Now I suspect my suspicion would be that that Trump is not an

236
00:12:57.671 --> 00:13:02.230
idiot and that he is saying that because they've seen something because

237
00:13:02.231 --> 00:13:07.010
otherwise to go on the record with that level of specific specificity is,

238
00:13:07.011 --> 00:13:11.350
is pretty crazy. So I think there's something there. I don't know what it is.

239
00:13:11.351 --> 00:13:14.320
I suppose we will find out. And as I said, this,

240
00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.990
this tweet was from about 20 minutes before we started here.

241
00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:20.560
So I'm guessing that the Internet's lit up with all sorts of theories right now.

242
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:21.130
Um,

243
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:24.340
but we clearly need to look into what's going on with this dominion software.

244
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.800
Well, so the name dominion, right?

245
00:13:26.801 --> 00:13:29.170
It doesn't sound like a scifi movie at this point.

246
00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:32.020
How did they steal the election and the dominion software? Who was,

247
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:35.300
it was dominion. Uh, yeah, it sounds like something. All right. Let's,

248
00:13:35.301 --> 00:13:37.360
let's jump on to, uh, to story. Number two,

249
00:13:37.361 --> 00:13:40.870
have you heard about this COVID thing? Uh, well, on Saturday when they,

250
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:45.130
when the media, whatever they are, when they called the election for, for bide,

251
00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.080
and suddenly we had two days of like, Oh,

252
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:50.710
coronavirus is going to go away and it's pretty much done.

253
00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:55.180
And we got this Pfizer vaccine and it's going to cure 90% of the people it'll

254
00:13:55.181 --> 00:13:57.010
work on 90%. We're all good to go.

255
00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:01.630
Then Monday rolled around and Trump started fighting again. Trump said,

256
00:14:01.631 --> 00:14:04.150
I'm not going to accept these results. We're going to go to all these States,

257
00:14:04.151 --> 00:14:06.730
we're gonna do all this stuff. And then suddenly you could feel it online.

258
00:14:06.731 --> 00:14:10.000
The Trump people were starting to fight back. And then what did the system do?

259
00:14:10.001 --> 00:14:13.210
It suddenly brought coronavirus back. So over the weekend,

260
00:14:13.211 --> 00:14:15.720
you've got thousands of people partying in,

261
00:14:15.721 --> 00:14:17.560
in New York and DC all over the place.

262
00:14:17.561 --> 00:14:20.110
You've probably seen the video of the partiers, I think in Brooklyn,

263
00:14:20.111 --> 00:14:22.870
where they're passing around champagne bottles and just drinking out of

264
00:14:22.871 --> 00:14:26.440
champagne bottles. Now that somehow that's not a super spreader event,

265
00:14:26.441 --> 00:14:30.010
but you know, if a Trump guy shows up in a mask with a flag, ease, you know,

266
00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:34.350
big Nazi, evil, you know, uh, super spreader guy.

267
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:40.350
Um, so suddenly we see all these celebrations, then Trump fights back.

268
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.131
And then suddenly,

269
00:14:41.131 --> 00:14:45.150
now they're telling us that Corona virus is just that COVID is just blowing up

270
00:14:45.151 --> 00:14:48.150
all over the place. So Andrew Cuomo, Andrew Cuomo,

271
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.130
who is the governor of New York.

272
00:14:50.131 --> 00:14:55.040
This is a man who caused the deaths of probably 30,000 people by sending

273
00:14:55.310 --> 00:15:00.200
elderly people back in to homes. We know this, don't take my word for it,

274
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:03.680
Google it. You can actually find it on the Google, at least for now. Uh,

275
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:07.250
he also then wrote a book somehow. Yeah, he wrote it. I mean, he wrote a book.

276
00:15:07.251 --> 00:15:11.750
Somebody wrote a forum about leadership during, uh COVID. Uh,

277
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:16.310
he was even on Howard stern the other day, promoting his book. Um, well,

278
00:15:16.311 --> 00:15:17.420
what does he decided to do?

279
00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:21.290
He's got a whole new list of things that you got to do. If you live in New York.

280
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.480
Oddly, I left New York to go to California.

281
00:15:23.481 --> 00:15:24.800
So I'm not saying I'm the perfect man,

282
00:15:24.801 --> 00:15:27.110
but let's get into some of the stuff that he has ordered here.

283
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:31.070
I'll read you the exact quote from Fox business Cuomo, ordered bars,

284
00:15:31.071 --> 00:15:31.851
restaurants,

285
00:15:31.851 --> 00:15:36.200
and any other establishment with state liquor licenses to end

286
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.920
indoor and outdoor dining by 10:00 PM.

287
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.420
Beginning on Friday,

288
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.980
the governor said that these restrictions were necessary after con contact.

289
00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:51.170
After contract tracing, data showed establishments where alcohol is served,

290
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:55.820
gyms and indoor gatherings at private homes were contributing to the

291
00:15:55.821 --> 00:15:59.360
spread of coronavirus. Okay? So there's a lot here.

292
00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:02.870
These people told us two weeks to flatten the curve.

293
00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.750
They told us that eight months ago, then they told us, Oh,

294
00:16:05.751 --> 00:16:09.290
we're going to just shut down for the summer. Then we rolled into the fall.

295
00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.780
Now we're rolling into Thanksgiving.

296
00:16:11.781 --> 00:16:14.080
And I guarantee you we're rolling into the new year.

297
00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:16.850
They love power and they love controlling your life. I did.

298
00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:21.050
I did the story yesterday about these ridiculous CDC guidelines about what you

299
00:16:21.051 --> 00:16:24.470
can do in your own home for Thanksgiving. I said,

300
00:16:24.471 --> 00:16:27.710
I was going to share the spoon. Everyone touched the spoon at my Thanksgiving.

301
00:16:27.711 --> 00:16:30.170
A lot of people picked up on that. I maybe we'll do it.

302
00:16:30.171 --> 00:16:32.000
I don't know if you know, if you want your own spoon,

303
00:16:32.001 --> 00:16:32.990
you can have your own spoon.

304
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:37.880
The point is we are allowing these people to control our lives in

305
00:16:37.881 --> 00:16:40.400
crazy ways. And we don't, we don't even know why.

306
00:16:40.401 --> 00:16:44.300
And we don't even know how it is that they have the power to exercise this

307
00:16:44.301 --> 00:16:48.380
nonsense over us. So at 10:00 PM, we're going to close liquor establishments.

308
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:50.480
We're going to close bars and we're gonna close restaurants.

309
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.720
So what do they think happens after 10:00 PM?

310
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.600
Why is 10:00 PM the lockdown now?

311
00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:01.490
Is it possible that some level of COVID is being spread at

312
00:17:01.491 --> 00:17:04.220
bars and restaurants? It is possible, as I said,

313
00:17:04.221 --> 00:17:06.710
I went to a restaurant last night. It was basically empty.

314
00:17:06.711 --> 00:17:09.320
It was quite depressing. Although the food was pretty good. Uh,

315
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:10.640
but there's nobody there.

316
00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:13.730
There's nobody there because everyone is just freaked out right now.

317
00:17:13.731 --> 00:17:18.530
So they are continually destroying the economy in the name of saving all of

318
00:17:18.531 --> 00:17:22.010
us. And guess what? Andrew Cuomo, I don't think you can save me.

319
00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:25.310
I don't think you can save me. I don't think Gavin Newsome can save me.

320
00:17:25.311 --> 00:17:28.400
The only people who can save each other are us.

321
00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:32.300
We can save each other by doing what we think is right in our own individual

322
00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:36.740
lives. You guys watching this through the YouTube machine, sitting at home,

323
00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.950
I believe you can probably make the right decisions for yourself. I know.

324
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:44.990
I know. I'm crazy. What can I tell ya? Um, so first off, okay,

325
00:17:44.991 --> 00:17:48.080
we got this 10:00 PM cutoff then yes. As I said,

326
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.460
is it possible that at a restaurant it could spread.

327
00:17:50.461 --> 00:17:54.090
Is it possible that has it at a gym? It could spread.

328
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:59.190
Is it possible at your own home? It could spread. These are all possible things.

329
00:17:59.191 --> 00:18:04.140
Yes. I don't deny that. But does that mean that the government has the right,

330
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:09.210
not even the right that the government has the duty to do these

331
00:18:09.211 --> 00:18:11.760
lockdowns and continue to destroy our lives?

332
00:18:11.761 --> 00:18:16.140
Look at the numbers of people that we have seen rises in suicide and in

333
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:17.070
alcoholism.

334
00:18:17.071 --> 00:18:21.840
And we've seen secondary sicknesses like cancer go up because people aren't

335
00:18:21.841 --> 00:18:22.680
getting screenings.

336
00:18:22.681 --> 00:18:25.050
They're not going to the doctor enough to do preventative stuff.

337
00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:29.790
We have seen a cascading series of problems that we won't even know the effects

338
00:18:29.791 --> 00:18:31.140
of for years and years.

339
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:35.130
But I would say all of this sort of goes back to what I told you at the

340
00:18:35.131 --> 00:18:38.130
beginning about me traveling. They are doing something to change,

341
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.420
how we all behave,

342
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:44.040
going to an airport and not being able to sit at a restaurant and nobody looking

343
00:18:44.041 --> 00:18:48.000
at anybody. And I don't even think they were playing music. If I'm not mistaken.

344
00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:52.860
And it was eerily silent, nobody looks, you don't make eye contact with anyone.

345
00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:57.000
We are doing something that is anti-human to, to separate ourselves.

346
00:18:57.001 --> 00:19:01.140
And that is not to diminish what the reality of the numbers is.

347
00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:05.850
But if you think that this government that can't really do much of anything,

348
00:19:05.851 --> 00:19:09.270
well, right? Like what does the government really do? Well,

349
00:19:09.271 --> 00:19:11.610
what problem would you have that you would go?

350
00:19:11.611 --> 00:19:13.410
I think the government should solve it.

351
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:17.190
This is something that actually aligns lefties and righties, right?

352
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:20.310
Like people on the right don't want the government to solve all their problems.

353
00:19:20.311 --> 00:19:21.540
That's very obvious. Right?

354
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.960
So that's one of the things that that's like a core piece of being on the right.

355
00:19:24.961 --> 00:19:26.310
You don't want the government to solve things.

356
00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:30.210
The flaw of leftist thinking is that the government, what they'll tell you,

357
00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:31.950
I mean, this is listen to what any of the progressive say,

358
00:19:31.951 --> 00:19:34.800
listen to what the Democrats are saying. The government is evil,

359
00:19:34.801 --> 00:19:39.660
it's patriarchal. It's, uh, it's racist. It's systemically racist,

360
00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:41.310
the rest of it. And what is their answer?

361
00:19:41.311 --> 00:19:45.330
Their answer is always give it more power. How about we have federal lockdowns?

362
00:19:45.331 --> 00:19:46.790
I mean, there are literally lefties who,

363
00:19:46.791 --> 00:19:48.540
who over the last six months were telling you,

364
00:19:48.541 --> 00:19:52.080
Trump is Hitler and we needed federal lockdowns because we needed to give Hitler

365
00:19:52.081 --> 00:19:55.380
more power to control all of our lives. You see why this doesn't work.

366
00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:58.920
Most of us realize the government ain't working quite right.

367
00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.190
Why give it more power over your decision-making?

368
00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.640
I think you should be able to celebrate Thanksgiving as you see fit.

369
00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:07.050
And more importantly,

370
00:20:07.051 --> 00:20:11.700
I think if you are a restaurant owner or anyone that owns

371
00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:14.700
any sort of shop that you have put your blood, sweat,

372
00:20:14.701 --> 00:20:18.990
and tears and life into that, you have the right to,

373
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.480
to open that business and do what you think is right.

374
00:20:21.481 --> 00:20:23.100
And if you want people to take their temperature,

375
00:20:23.101 --> 00:20:25.200
when they come in and wear masks, then that's up to you.

376
00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:27.810
And if they don't want to behave the way you want them to then keep them out.

377
00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:30.750
But the idea that we're outsourcing all of the,

378
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:34.260
all of the decision-making to the government and that Biden is literally saying,

379
00:20:34.261 --> 00:20:38.790
we will have a federal mask mandate as if what is happening in downtown New York

380
00:20:38.791 --> 00:20:42.210
city is applicable to what is happening in rural Idaho.

381
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.830
This is absolutely crazy. And we're running out of time to wake up to it.

382
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.000
Uh, all right. I want to do one other story real quick.

383
00:20:49.001 --> 00:20:53.760
We're we're tight on time here. Uh, but, uh, Haverford college, uh,

384
00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:58.260
the students Rose up against oppressive Haverford college, uh,

385
00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:01.890
and started to negotiate some things that they wanted, uh,

386
00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.420
to happen at Haverford college.

387
00:21:03.421 --> 00:21:04.980
You've probably never heard of Haverford college.

388
00:21:04.981 --> 00:21:07.710
It's not that important other than I think what you'll see here,

389
00:21:07.711 --> 00:21:10.890
the things that I'm going to bring up are indicative of what's happening across

390
00:21:10.891 --> 00:21:12.690
the universities, all over the place. Uh,

391
00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.130
but a bunch of students created a group.

392
00:21:14.131 --> 00:21:18.090
It was originally on Instagram and this was in protest of the shooting of wa uh,

393
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:22.620
Walter Wallace Jr. By Philadelphia police. So this is reported by the,

394
00:21:22.621 --> 00:21:24.600
by college news. Yeah.

395
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:28.470
And I'm going to read some of the demands that they have extracted out of

396
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.630
Haverford college, which again, you probably haven't heard,

397
00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:35.040
but I think this shows you what's happening across colleges all over the place.

398
00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:39.870
They secured 75,000 towards renovation at the black cultural center. Okay.

399
00:21:39.871 --> 00:21:41.190
That doesn't sound so bad. Maybe there,

400
00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.380
they need some money to fix some things there. That's just fine.

401
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:47.820
They canceled classes and jobs on election day and secured holiday pay versus

402
00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.530
central employees. I actually don't have a major problem with that. I think,

403
00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.850
you know, making sure people can vote is very important. Although we do,

404
00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:57.240
we live in a time where people are voting, uh, via mail.

405
00:21:57.241 --> 00:21:58.890
And I thought that was supposed to be good too.

406
00:21:58.891 --> 00:22:01.590
It sort of seems like you wouldn't need to do that, but yeah. Okay. Uh,

407
00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:06.210
they guaranteed full funding for all students who wish to visit a therapist of

408
00:22:06.211 --> 00:22:10.350
their choosing off campus. Well, that, that seems a little,

409
00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:14.130
it's strange to me. I mean, we're going to fund students, visiting therapists,

410
00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:17.490
whoever they want to visit off campus. We can't do that on campus.

411
00:22:17.491 --> 00:22:18.840
And why are we funding it?

412
00:22:18.841 --> 00:22:21.360
And what does that have to do with going to college and learning to become an

413
00:22:21.361 --> 00:22:25.680
adult? Uh, they secured a pass-fail model for the fall 20, 20 semester.

414
00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:29.370
No more grades guys. That's just fantastic. You either passed or you failed.

415
00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:32.520
It doesn't matter if you ACE the test or you, you pass by one question,

416
00:22:32.521 --> 00:22:33.540
you are the same,

417
00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.110
which is very much in line with a lot of what's coming out of left.

418
00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:40.050
You remember Kamala Harris is little cartoon right before, uh,

419
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:43.530
right before the election where she was basically promoting communism that said

420
00:22:43.531 --> 00:22:46.080
we will all end up in the same place.

421
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:48.900
That's the beauty of the system of equity that they want to create while they're

422
00:22:48.901 --> 00:22:52.860
doing that now at Haverford college, because you'll either pass or fail.

423
00:22:52.861 --> 00:22:56.970
It won't matter whether you pass by one question or you or you ACE the test,

424
00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.740
a couple others I'll throw two out here.

425
00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:04.770
They secured an annual operating budget of 25 grand for work completed

426
00:23:04.771 --> 00:23:07.590
under the chief diversity officer. Now, as you guys know,

427
00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:09.420
the chief diversity officer officer,

428
00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:13.740
usually there is to inject systemic racism into the system because that's what

429
00:23:13.741 --> 00:23:15.300
they're doing know under the name of diversity.

430
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:19.920
They secured 75 grand for bias training at the college over the next two years.

431
00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.790
They guaranteed compensation for up to 20 hours of missed work while

432
00:23:23.791 --> 00:23:28.320
participating in a strike. So if you don't go to work because you want a strike,

433
00:23:28.321 --> 00:23:32.580
they'll pay you for it. Do you see how insane this is?

434
00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:33.990
What does that have to do with anything?

435
00:23:33.991 --> 00:23:37.080
What does that have to do with being an adult? These are the places where we're,

436
00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:38.071
we're learning things.

437
00:23:38.071 --> 00:23:40.920
And there's just one or two more here that I'll throw two real quick.

438
00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:45.980
They encouraged inter departmental discussion and reforms to center anti-racist

439
00:23:45.981 --> 00:23:50.000
work in every discipline. I had no idea that Haverford college was so racist,

440
00:23:50.001 --> 00:23:52.340
but all of these colleges that are lefty colleges,

441
00:23:52.341 --> 00:23:56.060
apparently they're all very deeply racist. And it goes across curriculums,

442
00:23:56.061 --> 00:23:58.430
which is actually pretty amazing. And finally,

443
00:23:58.431 --> 00:24:03.410
they secured reserved caps hours for LGBTQ students and

444
00:24:03.411 --> 00:24:08.060
the commitment to hire other another counselor specializing in working with

445
00:24:08.061 --> 00:24:10.220
LGBTQ people. Uh,

446
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:14.390
you guys might remember the famous Supreme court case. Brown vs the board of ed,

447
00:24:14.391 --> 00:24:17.270
which decided that separate but equal. That's no good.

448
00:24:17.271 --> 00:24:19.550
You can't have black people in this school and white people in this school

449
00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:20.660
separate, equal, no good.

450
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:25.610
But apparently now we want to separate everybody by race and by gender and

451
00:24:25.611 --> 00:24:29.330
by sexuality and all of those silly things. Anyway,

452
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.030
it's not that Haberford university is that important,

453
00:24:32.031 --> 00:24:36.860
but these things that we've been talking about about critical race theory about

454
00:24:36.861 --> 00:24:40.820
title nine, all of these bad ideas about anti-racism,

455
00:24:40.821 --> 00:24:44.120
which is actually racism and the way they're injecting it into the system,

456
00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:48.500
it's all still here, guys. It's all still here. And we got work to do, uh,

457
00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:49.700
speaking of work to do,

458
00:24:49.701 --> 00:24:52.850
I am doing roughly a bajillion blaze shows while I'm in town.

459
00:24:52.851 --> 00:24:54.440
I'm in town for a couple of days. Uh,

460
00:24:54.441 --> 00:24:58.370
I shot Allie Stuckey's podcast this morning. It was actually a great interview.

461
00:24:58.371 --> 00:25:00.920
I think you're really gonna dig it. So I'll make sure that I tweet that out.

462
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:04.640
I'm doing some stuff with Glenn Beck tomorrow and a couple of the other blaze

463
00:25:04.641 --> 00:25:04.911
hosts.

464
00:25:04.911 --> 00:25:08.750
I may even see that Steven Crowder guy that that's the rumor we'll see about

465
00:25:08.751 --> 00:25:12.290
that. Um, and, and I've got a couple other business meetings,

466
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:17.060
good things are happening. Stay sane, everybody. It's going to be okay.

467
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:21.140
I promise you and I'll be back tomorrow. Thanks everybody.
