WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.450
<v 0>For you to basically chastise me about, uh,</v>

2
00:00:03.451 --> 00:00:06.870
what Trump has done for the black community and especially coming from joy Bay

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.780
horror. I thought, I thought, you know, you're number one, not in Baltimore,

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.690
you don't live in one of these dangerous cities and you're not black.

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.160
And so I just thought, you know,

6
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:18.630
how could you basically tell me how I should be feeling in this situation? Um,

7
00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:21.840
I'm on the ground every single day. My team is out there seven days a week,

8
00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:24.930
knocking doors. We registered voters five days a week.

9
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.100
And so I wanted to talk about all the great grassroots things we were doing, uh,

10
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.430
as Republicans, you know, and I talked about this in my RNC convention,

11
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:35.280
speech Republicans, usually right off the inner cities.

12
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.820
And so I wanted to talk about the fact that we're actually providing an option

13
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.820
for inner city communities. And it just kind of went left.

14
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.430
<v 1>All right, everybody, this is a Rubin report on the fly today.</v>

15
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.260
Joining me is Kim classic.

16
00:00:54.261 --> 00:00:58.310
She's a Republican candidate for Congress in Maryland seventh district,

17
00:00:58.311 --> 00:00:59.660
which covers Baltimore.

18
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.100
Kim had quite a morning and I reached out to her and she immediately responded.

19
00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:06.470
So here we are, Kim, how you doing?

20
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.520
<v 0>Hey, how are you? I'm doing, doing well so far.</v>

21
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.980
<v 1>I'm doing pretty well,</v>

22
00:01:12.981 --> 00:01:17.900
but you have had one of those mornings because you went viral and I've wanted

23
00:01:17.901 --> 00:01:18.920
to have you on the show,

24
00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:23.150
but you were on the view this morning and we're going to show the clip in just a

25
00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:26.510
second. But before we get to the clip that everybody's talking about,

26
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.590
did you kind of have a sense that it might go in this direction?

27
00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:33.650
I just want to get your sense of like where your head was at before and then

28
00:01:33.651 --> 00:01:34.484
we'll show the clip.

29
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.080
<v 0>Yeah. So, um, the view actually the Booker called me, uh,</v>

30
00:01:39.081 --> 00:01:43.250
yesterday to basically give me a rundown and talk to me about the questions

31
00:01:43.251 --> 00:01:45.860
that, uh, the ladies were going to ask me. Um,

32
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.190
since she gave me about 20 questions, she said, we'll get to five of them, but,

33
00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:53.360
you know, just so you have them, uh, you'll know exactly where we're going. Um,

34
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.270
so, you know, I honestly, from the questions that she gave me,

35
00:01:56.271 --> 00:02:00.110
I thought it was going to be kind of an even keel conversation. Um,

36
00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:02.180
I thought they wanted to know a little bit about, you know,

37
00:02:02.181 --> 00:02:05.810
what I want to do in Baltimore, the policies that I'll put forth. Um,

38
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.460
so I didn't see it coming to, you know, what about Trump? What about Trump?

39
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.740
Uh, but when it did, I just thought, you know what,

40
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.430
I'm here to talk about what I want to bring to the table and district seven. So,

41
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.760
uh, you know, I, I just said, okay, you know, I've had enough of this.

42
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.460
I'm just going to keep going and, and just, you know,

43
00:02:22.461 --> 00:02:24.800
be honest and be myself at this point.

44
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.800
<v 1>Yeah. Okay. So before we show the clip,</v>

45
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.670
I should just add that before this happened in the clip,

46
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.630
you had a really nice exchange with Megan McCain, totally respectful.

47
00:02:35.631 --> 00:02:40.010
You got to talk about your ideas and then joy Bay,

48
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.370
hard chimed in. So we'll throw it to the clip. Come on Kim, excuse me.

49
00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:44.810
I have to say something to you.

50
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.880
He told Bob Woodward that it was a very serious issue and it's an airborne

51
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.170
and that it was terrible.

52
00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:53.810
And then they went out and told the American people don't wear masks.

53
00:02:53.811 --> 00:02:57.770
It's all going to go away. You have to put some blame on your trash. I'm sorry.

54
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.100
You putting it on something extraneous.

55
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.600
<v 0>Here. Talk to the point, please. Is this, is this joy speaking,</v>

56
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.700
joy, joy rated around in black face. Not too long ago.

57
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.110
Come on, Joel. I don't think he should be

58
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.520
[inaudible] the black community had my back. They know that

59
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.370
[inaudible] has your back. The black community has your back

60
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.770
for you, black. You know what? He did not vote for you.

61
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.160
It was during a special study. Can I speak,

62
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.320
what are you living during a special while we were still

63
00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:44.800
under locked out and I cannot talk to people. Can I speak,

64
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.290
are you just going to sprinkle? This becomes a big listen,

65
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.850
thanks to Kim Cleland. Very immature, but thank you for having me.

66
00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.750
<v 1>Okay. So that is the clip that is going around the world right now,</v>

67
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.680
where you ready with that? Like, were you ready? Just to be like,

68
00:04:04.681 --> 00:04:08.610
if they go that route, I'm going to have to pull out the black face thing.

69
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.040
<v 0>No, I honestly,</v>

70
00:04:11.041 --> 00:04:15.360
I wanted to just really strictly stick to the policies and I wanted to talk a

71
00:04:15.361 --> 00:04:18.720
little bit more about my opponent. You know, I did lose in a special election.

72
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.000
Um, I pulled his, this horn in since May 5th,

73
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.870
and I wanted to basically highlight the fact that he hasn't done anything since

74
00:04:24.871 --> 00:04:28.860
being in the seat. Um, so when they kept going on the Trump situation,

75
00:04:28.861 --> 00:04:33.630
I thought, you know what for you to basically chastise me about, uh,

76
00:04:33.631 --> 00:04:37.020
what Trump has done for the black community and especially coming from joy Bay

77
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.930
horror, I thought, I thought, you know, your number one, not in Baltimore,

78
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.870
you don't live in one of these dangerous cities and you're not black.

79
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.340
And so I just thought, you know,

80
00:04:44.341 --> 00:04:48.810
how could you basically tell me how I should be feeling in this situation? Um,

81
00:04:48.811 --> 00:04:52.020
I'm on the ground every single day. My team is out there seven days a week,

82
00:04:52.021 --> 00:04:55.110
knocking doors, and we registered voters five days a week.

83
00:04:55.111 --> 00:04:59.250
And so I wanted to talk about all the great grassroots things we were doing, uh,

84
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.610
as Republicans, you know, when I talked about this in my RNC convention,

85
00:05:02.611 --> 00:05:05.430
speech Republicans, usually right off the inner cities.

86
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.970
And so I wanted to talk about the fact that we're actually providing an option

87
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.850
for inner city communities. And it just kinda went left.

88
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.580
<v 1>It went left, no, no pun intended. Um, what,</v>

89
00:05:16.581 --> 00:05:18.930
what do you make of the line that joy said,

90
00:05:18.931 --> 00:05:22.980
which is I have the support of the black community and that there was two

91
00:05:22.981 --> 00:05:23.850
things. It was,

92
00:05:23.851 --> 00:05:27.930
I have the support of the black community and that her black face was an

93
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.610
Amash somehow, because she's a lefty when she does black face.

94
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.230
It's an Omar judge.

95
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.550
But of course we know if someone on the right did blackface to be silly or

96
00:05:38.551 --> 00:05:40.050
Halloween or whatever it might be,

97
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.930
we know this is not going to be taken as an homage. What do you,

98
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.130
what do you make of those two things?

99
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.730
<v 0>Yeah. I don't know how she could even reconcile with those. You know,</v>

100
00:05:47.731 --> 00:05:49.470
we saw Megan from Fox news.

101
00:05:49.471 --> 00:05:53.680
Remember she had her own daily talk show and she was just totally, yeah,

102
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.430
she didn't, it was just talking about the fact that she didn't realize, but,

103
00:05:57.431 --> 00:06:01.400
you know, hanging Omaj or blackface, uh, was disrespectful.

104
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.950
I remember she was talking about how kids grew up, you know,

105
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.490
doing the Michael Jackson and that was a costume for Halloween.

106
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.970
So she was actually reprimanded just for talking about it.

107
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.110
And so here's an individual that actually did it. And then she says to me,

108
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:18.290
you know, the black community has her back, uh, because, you know,

109
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.340
I guess she's joy Bay, her, I don't know. I don't know her very well. Um,

110
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.820
but what I will say is, you know, it didn't make any sense to me.

111
00:06:25.821 --> 00:06:29.240
It was very unfair. And this is kind of what we see in the media today.

112
00:06:29.241 --> 00:06:32.440
You've got Megan Kelly who basically gets asked eyes and,

113
00:06:32.441 --> 00:06:35.330
and people are trying to counsel her, uh, for talking about,

114
00:06:35.331 --> 00:06:37.910
or even asking the question. And then you've got Joey Bay,

115
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.600
her on the other hand who actually did it, but she should be, you know,

116
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.030
able to do so, because I guess she's on the left.

117
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.440
And so this is what I think we see a lot media bias. Um, but you know,

118
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:49.550
I'm not standing for it.

119
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.720
<v 1>What about that phrase? The black community,</v>

120
00:06:52.721 --> 00:06:55.630
because there's something about that phrase that you say the black community,

121
00:06:55.631 --> 00:06:57.490
the gay community, whatever it is, it's as,

122
00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:02.110
as if these people all think the same thing and she has the gall to say it to

123
00:07:02.111 --> 00:07:05.290
you, you happen to be black, nobody cares.

124
00:07:05.291 --> 00:07:08.490
But if you're saying the black community supports me will, well,

125
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:09.610
I don't think Kim does.

126
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.350
<v 0>Yeah, absolutely. I've been black for 38 years. You know, I comfortable black,</v>

127
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.000
you know, I it's like, I can't believe that people say these kinds of things.

128
00:07:19.001 --> 00:07:22.120
And I think this is something that even Candace Owens has touched on before,

129
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.390
you know, you can't be a white liberal or anybody, you know,

130
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.880
have a different color and tell us about our community.

131
00:07:27.881 --> 00:07:30.970
I can't tell a Jewish person how they should feel, you know,

132
00:07:30.971 --> 00:07:33.940
with the antisemitism that we see across the country, you know?

133
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:38.020
So we have to make sure that we allow those people to still have a voice at the

134
00:07:38.021 --> 00:07:40.720
same time. I'm not the kind of person to put everybody in a box.

135
00:07:40.721 --> 00:07:44.590
I think that's divisive. Uh, but again, I was ready to talk about the policies.

136
00:07:44.591 --> 00:07:47.020
I was ready to talk about career opportunities that I want to bring to

137
00:07:47.021 --> 00:07:48.970
Baltimore. Um, and I thought, you know what?

138
00:07:48.971 --> 00:07:51.460
This is a great time to talk to the other side of the aisle.

139
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.620
I never get invited to CNN or MSNBC or, you know, left wing media. Uh,

140
00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.090
they don't even want me on there.

141
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.840
So I thought this is a great chance to just reach that audience and talk about

142
00:08:01.841 --> 00:08:05.080
what I want to bring to the community, uh, as a member of Congress.

143
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.490
And it kinda just went a completely different way. Uh,

144
00:08:08.491 --> 00:08:11.350
I'm sorry that it ended up that way, but at the same time,

145
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.240
I'm not sorry for defending myself.

146
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.570
<v 1>Yeah. Well, I don't think you have anything to be sorry for it. Cause you,</v>

147
00:08:16.571 --> 00:08:20.170
you were a total pro, but you know, because we talk about these things in the,

148
00:08:20.171 --> 00:08:23.890
in the context of identity politics that they're kind of throwing on us,

149
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.040
like the, the female element of this.

150
00:08:27.041 --> 00:08:29.710
Like if you were to ask the ladies of the view,

151
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.310
I'm sure all of them would say we're we're for all women we're we're for all

152
00:08:33.311 --> 00:08:36.640
women. And yet the way Sonny framed her first question to you was,

153
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.750
was deeply dismissive. We just watched what, what joy did to you?

154
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:42.520
What do you make about that sort of thing?

155
00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:47.080
The way Republican or just right-leaning women or just non-progressive women

156
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.450
are, are treated by these women.

157
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:54.910
<v 0>Yeah. So there's a trend right now is called a hashtag win with black women.</v>

158
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:55.441
Right?

159
00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:58.440
And they're talking about the fact that they were so excited that Kamala Harris

160
00:08:58.441 --> 00:09:02.370
was picked as Joe Biden's VP. Right. That was the whole thing.

161
00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:05.730
But it's only when with black women, if you are a Democrat,

162
00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:07.320
if you think like them, you know,

163
00:09:07.321 --> 00:09:10.920
if you're a black woman running as a Republican, that is like, Oh my gosh,

164
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.410
I can't believe you're running. You're a, your uncle, Tom,

165
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.570
you're all these things. And so for me, you know,

166
00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:18.930
when you're in the black community and you've been voting for Democrats for over

167
00:09:18.931 --> 00:09:21.900
50 years, um, they do take our vote for granted.

168
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.210
And that's what I was kind of showing in Baltimore, you know,

169
00:09:24.211 --> 00:09:27.480
for us to move the needle, we have to have allies on both sides of the aisle.

170
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.790
So I don't understand why we do this.

171
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:33.210
We chastise each other because we want to run in a different party.

172
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.750
I noticed in the white community, you can run as a Democrat or Republican.

173
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.840
They don't actually, you know, chastise you for it. Uh,

174
00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:42.450
but in the black community, we have something totally different going on.

175
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:46.080
So it's it's, to me, you know, they just want you to think the same,

176
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:47.460
I guess they always want you to do it.

177
00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:50.490
But I look at those women in the view and I know they are both are,

178
00:09:50.491 --> 00:09:52.620
all of them are millionaires. You know,

179
00:09:52.621 --> 00:09:56.430
they live in a different basically society. And the people do in West Baltimore.

180
00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.410
I know study said she's from Baltimore.

181
00:09:58.411 --> 00:10:02.070
I wanted to ask her when's the last time she's been to wasps Baltimore. Um,

182
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.680
because it is it's, we've got 17,000 vacant homes.

183
00:10:04.681 --> 00:10:08.130
We have a poor education system. Um, and we have crime and violence.

184
00:10:08.131 --> 00:10:09.480
And so for me, it's like,

185
00:10:09.481 --> 00:10:12.210
I don't think they understand because they're not on the ground.

186
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.500
They don't feel it like we do here. And so that was my point. And then I hope,

187
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.000
uh, that point got across.

188
00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.430
<v 1>Yeah. So I want to do a bigger interview with you before the election.</v>

189
00:10:22.431 --> 00:10:23.930
So people can really talk about your ideas,

190
00:10:23.931 --> 00:10:26.180
but we just wanted to do this quick and in light of the view thing,

191
00:10:26.181 --> 00:10:27.830
but just let's just do a couple of things.

192
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.010
Cause I think you made some really interesting points also in the interview,

193
00:10:31.011 --> 00:10:33.830
despite everything, is it 52 years,

194
00:10:33.831 --> 00:10:36.440
53 years of democratic rule in Baltimore.

195
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.110
<v 0>53 Years, we've been under.</v>

196
00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:40.520
<v 1>53.</v>

197
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:45.380
Do you sense when you say that to people like the average person in Baltimore,

198
00:10:45.381 --> 00:10:47.840
when you tell them that when they say, okay, we've got all these problems,

199
00:10:47.841 --> 00:10:50.750
we got crime, we got drugs, we got homelessness, blah, blah, blah.

200
00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.540
When you say to them, okay, I hear ya. I agree.

201
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.200
We got 53 years of democratic rule. Does that,

202
00:10:57.201 --> 00:11:00.620
do you think that actually starting to get through to people because we see this

203
00:11:00.621 --> 00:11:02.690
in all of the big cities that have the problems,

204
00:11:02.691 --> 00:11:07.100
they seem to all be run by Democrats for decades. It's just a fact. Yeah.

205
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.910
<v 0>Absolutely. I mean our pollings that come back next week, I think on Tuesday,</v>

206
00:11:10.911 --> 00:11:13.400
but we have a lot of people that have been saying, you know what,

207
00:11:13.401 --> 00:11:17.030
I'm voting for Kim classic. They get it. They understand, you know,

208
00:11:17.031 --> 00:11:20.270
voting for the same party, having your vote taken for granted. You know,

209
00:11:20.271 --> 00:11:23.840
this is a situation I posted last year of videos of the fact that there are

210
00:11:23.841 --> 00:11:27.110
certain neighborhoods where they can even get the trash picked up. I mean,

211
00:11:27.111 --> 00:11:31.250
this is a real serious situation. This is 20, 20 it's America.

212
00:11:31.251 --> 00:11:32.690
And people shouldn't be living like this.

213
00:11:32.691 --> 00:11:36.050
So I don't know why the women on the view would actually, you know,

214
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.740
be mad at me for trying to make a black community better and give them a better

215
00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:42.230
quality of life. Uh, but that's where we are today.

216
00:11:42.231 --> 00:11:46.520
And that's just how divisive things are and how polarizing it is in certain

217
00:11:46.521 --> 00:11:47.354
parts of the media.

218
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:52.070
<v 1>Yeah. So you gave a pretty spectacular speech, I think, at the RNC.</v>

219
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.160
And can you talk a little bit, you know,

220
00:11:54.161 --> 00:11:59.020
I think still it's sorta like the stereotype related to 53 years of

221
00:11:59.021 --> 00:12:02.320
democratic rule. People can't understand that maybe you want to change that.

222
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:06.040
Can you talk a little bit about what you've seen in the last year or two going

223
00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:07.330
on with the Republican party?

224
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.420
Because it does seem to me that it's getting a lot wider we're now I just saw a

225
00:12:10.421 --> 00:12:14.950
poll, something like 45% of gay men are gonna are going to vote Republican.

226
00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:18.250
Like these are crazy numbers and we're seeing similar things with,

227
00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.250
with the black community, something like 30%. Now,

228
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:22.720
can you talk about that a little bit?

229
00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.370
<v 0>Absolutely. So I think there's going to be a lot of people,</v>

230
00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:28.590
especially in the black community voting for president Trump,

231
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:30.180
you have to think first and foremost,

232
00:12:30.181 --> 00:12:32.340
a lot of people don't even want to admit it because you know,

233
00:12:32.341 --> 00:12:36.360
the cancel culture and the backlash from it. Um, but people understand. I mean,

234
00:12:36.361 --> 00:12:39.420
when you have president Trump tweeting out, look district seven,

235
00:12:39.421 --> 00:12:42.810
if you vote for Kimberly classic, she wants to bring career opportunities.

236
00:12:42.811 --> 00:12:46.290
She wants to bring businesses. People understand that's basically him saying,

237
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:50.730
if she's elected and I'm reelected, we're going to make Baltimore great. Again,

238
00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:51.121
you know,

239
00:12:51.121 --> 00:12:55.320
we were once a manufacturing powerhouse here and we allowed all those jobs to go

240
00:12:55.321 --> 00:12:58.530
overseas or in a Clinton administration. And I think Trump, you know,

241
00:12:58.531 --> 00:13:01.650
he's all about the economy and he wants to bring a lot of those jobs back.

242
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:06.150
I wouldn't bring that biotech industry here to Baltimore so we can do that. Um,

243
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.650
but at the same time, it's like, look,

244
00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.970
if you're not here on the ground and you don't understand firsthand what people

245
00:13:11.971 --> 00:13:13.760
are going through, um, that I,

246
00:13:13.761 --> 00:13:16.320
I really don't understand how you can comment on it. You know,

247
00:13:16.321 --> 00:13:18.300
I know Sonny said she grew up in Baltimore.

248
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.330
I have not seen her in West Baltimore a day in my life.

249
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.690
And I've been in this area for 10 years now, but at the same time, it's like,

250
00:13:24.691 --> 00:13:26.790
look, why don't we come up with solutions?

251
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:30.660
Why are we going back and forth basically saying who's black enough or who's not

252
00:13:30.661 --> 00:13:32.430
black enough. That's just a distraction.

253
00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.730
We get to make some real results come to the area.

254
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:37.150
<v 1>Okay. So speaking of Baltimore, there,</v>

255
00:13:37.151 --> 00:13:39.420
there was another moment in the clip today where,

256
00:13:39.421 --> 00:13:42.720
when Sonny asks her first question, but you know, she doesn't really say hello.

257
00:13:42.721 --> 00:13:44.880
She basically kind of throws you under the bus while you're not living in

258
00:13:44.881 --> 00:13:48.030
Baltimore right now. She's from Baltimore. Uh,

259
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.060
and you had a great response to her. I thought, uh, could you,

260
00:13:51.061 --> 00:13:54.850
could you just kind of repeat what, what you've done in Baltimore and,

261
00:13:54.851 --> 00:13:56.430
and why you care about Baltimore?

262
00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:00.840
<v 0>Yeah. So for the past eight years I've been working with my nonprofits workforce</v>

263
00:14:00.841 --> 00:14:04.620
development. Um, we haven't gotten many grants received any money, you know,

264
00:14:04.621 --> 00:14:06.180
it's kind of something that we did on our own,

265
00:14:06.181 --> 00:14:09.570
but we helped over 200 women become gainfully, employed,

266
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.230
30% went on to be financially independent. And so for me,

267
00:14:13.231 --> 00:14:16.680
that's what I'm trying to do as a member of Congress is bring those career

268
00:14:16.681 --> 00:14:19.500
opportunities, uh, focus more on job training,

269
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.780
putting apprenticeship programs through the high schools.

270
00:14:21.781 --> 00:14:24.600
Like this is all stuff that I wanted to talk about on the view. Um,

271
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.750
but I wasn't given that opportunity, but you know, that's what it's about.

272
00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.280
Getting people back to work, you know,

273
00:14:29.281 --> 00:14:32.940
getting some of that crime and violence down because there are opportunities.

274
00:14:32.941 --> 00:14:34.950
And so for me, I feel like, you know, Sonny,

275
00:14:34.951 --> 00:14:38.550
if she's from Baltimore and she sees how bad we're suffering here,

276
00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:41.100
why hasn't she tried to come home and do anything?

277
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:44.460
I haven't heard anything that he's tried to do on the ground here.

278
00:14:44.461 --> 00:14:46.650
If this is really truly her home, you know,

279
00:14:46.651 --> 00:14:49.500
there's a lot of people suffering here. So I don't know. I don't,

280
00:14:49.501 --> 00:14:52.850
I don't even know why she threw that in there, but she did. Yeah.

281
00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:58.150
<v 1>Just the idea that the people who were screaming the most about</v>

282
00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.600
racism these days, the people who were screaming the most about sexism,

283
00:15:01.601 --> 00:15:04.930
homophobia, the rest of the buzzwords, that in many cases,

284
00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.630
they're the ones who were pushing it more than anyone else.

285
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.560
<v 0>Absolutely. I mean, we see that a lot with the whole defund,</v>

286
00:15:11.561 --> 00:15:13.000
the police narrative, right?

287
00:15:13.001 --> 00:15:16.990
We live in a city where most of the crime is perpetrated against black people.

288
00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:21.940
Gallup did a poll, 81% of black Americans do not want to defund the police.

289
00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:25.780
The only people talking about it are people that live in gated communities,

290
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:29.440
or they're running around with security themselves. You know, there's not,

291
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:33.040
there's not the people living in these dangerous community that is saying defund

292
00:15:33.041 --> 00:15:34.720
the police. And it doesn't make any sense.

293
00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:38.320
If you want police to be better trained, you want police reform,

294
00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:42.130
you need more funding. So it makes absolutely no sense at all.

295
00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.100
And nobody on the ground is saying that. But yeah, that's what we see.

296
00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:49.030
We see the people that are living the elite life, uh, basically saying,

297
00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:52.120
this is what people living in low income neighborhoods one,

298
00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:54.790
and that's just not true. They never take the,

299
00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:58.570
the cameras into these neighborhoods and talk to people on the ground.

300
00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.550
They just act as if they know what they want.

301
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:03.940
<v 1>You probably saw it, you know, Nancy,</v>

302
00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.930
Pelosi's been kind of pushing along the riots or not saying anything about them.

303
00:16:07.931 --> 00:16:09.430
And then like, what two days ago,

304
00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:14.020
someone literally pooped on her driveway and then suddenly she spoke out against

305
00:16:14.021 --> 00:16:17.230
the riots. So it kinda came home for her. Okay. I know your,

306
00:16:17.231 --> 00:16:21.040
your phone is melting and do, and I appreciate you taking the time. Uh,

307
00:16:21.041 --> 00:16:23.710
where can people go if they want to find out more about you and,

308
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:27.460
and give one pitch to the people that don't know yet that are just finding out

309
00:16:27.461 --> 00:16:28.294
about you?

310
00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.990
<v 0>Yes. You could definitely go to Kim K for congress.com.</v>

311
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.770
You can find me on Twitter at Kim K Baltimore. And I'm honestly a,

312
00:16:35.771 --> 00:16:40.420
non-politician just trying to run to fix the problems that we have.

313
00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.830
My first and foremost thing is to bring more career opportunities to the

314
00:16:44.831 --> 00:16:48.220
Baltimore area. And just back to America in general, right?

316
00:16:51.611 --> 00:16:56.050
cities that was relied on manufacturing. We need to bring those jobs back home.

317
00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.160
So that's my big thing.

318
00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.420

00:17:05.381 --> 00:17:08.630
to get all the accolades. You enjoy it. You, uh, you deserve it.
