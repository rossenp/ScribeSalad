WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.810
<v 0>One, they fund 12 times as much, $12 billion a year,</v>

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.860
compared to the government of nutrition science that shows candy is great for

3
00:00:07.861 --> 00:00:10.800
weight loss for kids. And that soda is not linked to obesity,

4
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:12.090
which is just nonsense, right?

5
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.050
They co-op professional societies like the American heart association,

6
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.940
the Academy of nutrition, dietetics, and fund their organizations.

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.840
The nutrition organization gets 40% of their funding from the food industry and

8
00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:26.730
in their annual conference.

9
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.640
You're not allowed to take pictures in the exhibit hall because they don't want

10
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:30.474
people to see all the things.

11
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:32.503
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

12
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.110
<v 0>It's terrifying to me because we're threatening our future generation.</v>

13
00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:42.080
We're threatening our global economic competitiveness. Uh,

14
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.320
we're threatening our ability to actually have good national security because

15
00:00:45.321 --> 00:00:50.300
70% of the recruits for the military are rejected because they're

16
00:00:50.301 --> 00:00:51.630
unfit to fight. It's, uh,

17
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.550
a national security threat that the generals and admirals have written a report

18
00:00:55.551 --> 00:00:57.770
saying unhealthy and unprepared. I mean, just from,

19
00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.900
just from the war in Iraq and Afghanistan,

20
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.060
there were 70 plus percent more evacuations for obesity

21
00:01:05.061 --> 00:01:10.030
rated related injuries than for war injuries. I think about that, that,

22
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.530
that actually almost doesn't sound, it doesn't sound possible.

23
00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:16.310
And then I just talked to a woman who works at the top level in the department

24
00:01:16.311 --> 00:01:18.890
of defense a couple of days ago, she said on,

25
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.700
on the military bases that are just loaded with fast food restaurants,

26
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.620
the combat troops are not combat ready

27
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.170
because they become so unfit. So.

28
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.940
<v 1>That's S well,</v>

29
00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:36.560
how do you get from knowing that this stuff ain't right to having all these fast

30
00:01:36.561 --> 00:01:39.020
food joints on the combat basis?

31
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.420
<v 0>Well, let's just like they have fast food in schools.</v>

32
00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:44.090
They have McDonald's Monday and taco bell Tuesday,

33
00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:48.770
and Wendy's Wednesday 80% of contracts of the schools have contracts with soda

34
00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:52.910
companies. Uh, you know, these companies are very smart and deliberate.

35
00:01:52.911 --> 00:01:55.310
So while there may not have been bad intentions to start,

36
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.050
there is a lot of bad behavior.

37
00:01:57.051 --> 00:02:01.640
Now they have a massive way of controlling the narrative about food and

38
00:02:01.641 --> 00:02:05.960
confusing consumers, confusing the scientists and confusing politicians. One,

39
00:02:05.961 --> 00:02:08.000
they fund 12 times as much,

40
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.350
$12 billion a year compared to the government of nutrition science that shows

41
00:02:12.351 --> 00:02:16.340
candy is great for weight loss for kids. And it's soda is not linked to obesity,

42
00:02:16.341 --> 00:02:17.630
which is just nonsense, right?

43
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.590
They co-op professional societies like the American heart association,

44
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.480
the Academy of nutrition, dietetics, and fund their organizations.

45
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.380
The nutrition organization gets 40% of their funding from the food industry and

46
00:02:30.381 --> 00:02:32.270
in their annual conference.

47
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.180
You're not allowed to take pictures in the exhibit hall because they don't want

48
00:02:35.181 --> 00:02:38.060
people to see all the junk food that they're promoting. Right? Uh,

49
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.890
they fund the American heart association,

50
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:43.520
which allows them to say tricks are a heart healthy food. Cause it's low in fat.

51
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.840
I mean, it's, it's frightening.

52
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.400
And they create friend groups for companies spent half a billion dollars on

53
00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:54.020
front groups to confuse consumers saying that, for example, uh,

54
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.070
the pesticides and high fructose corn syrup and trans fats and smoking are not

55
00:02:58.071 --> 00:03:00.400
bad for you. Like the American on science and health,

56
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.740
they spent $30 million fighting GMO labeling in California when they won that

57
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:09.970
battle. Uh, they fund social groups like the, uh,

58
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.250
NAACP and Hispanic Federation. So they,

59
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.630
co-opt the very groups that have most effected by these conditions like diabetes

60
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:20.920
and obesity. So they will oppose things like soda taxes. They were the,

61
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:23.920
one of the biggest opposition groups to the big gulp, uh,

62
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.370
recommendations from Michael Bloomberg, which I think it was ill advised idea,

63
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.080
but still they were opposing it, right?

64
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.570
Because they were funded by these groups.

65
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.610
They fund nutritionists and dieticians to go on social media saying we shouldn't

66
00:03:36.611 --> 00:03:40.540
have soda taxes or that sodas, okay. I mean, it's, it's just insidious.

67
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:45.010
And then they fund the political process. So just on one bill,

68
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.170
the GMO labeling bill,

69
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.860
which was euphemistically called the dark act of dying Americans,

70
00:03:50.861 --> 00:03:51.730
the right to know,

71
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.380
they spent $192 million in one year on one bill.

72
00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.350
They spent half a billion dollars on the farm bill,

73
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.410
which is governing most of our food programs like food stamps.

74
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.370
They fund feeding America, which is a hunger group, which is great,

75
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:09.040
a hunger advocacy group to make sure we deal with hunger in America.

76
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.350
On the board of that group are high-level executives from the food industry,

77
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.330
which is why they oppose restricting food stamps for soda or

78
00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:23.980
other junk food. Right? So now government is paying $7 billion a year.

79
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:26.620
The single biggest line item for food stamps for soda,

80
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:29.140
for the poor that's 30 billion a year.

81
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.720
<v 1>Sicker. Then back to the Medicare problems. You mentioned.</v>

82
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.740
<v 0>The true cost of food is not in the price we pay at the checkout counter.</v>

83
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.780
So you buy a can of soda. Well, let's look at what happens to the corn, right?

84
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.023
<v 1>I'm off the soda.</v>

85
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.810
I just feel that I can tell you that I haven't had a regular soda in God knows

86
00:04:45.811 --> 00:04:50.400
how long. So here's, here's the health clubs, clubs. Hi, here's how the, the,

87
00:04:50.401 --> 00:04:50.880
the, the.

88
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.040
<v 0>So the connectivity works in corn. So yeah,</v>

89
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.300
government funds the subsidies that support corn production,

90
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.340
these monocrop that are heavy use of fertilizers, pesticides,

91
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.290
herbicides that corn production itself destroys.

92
00:05:07.291 --> 00:05:11.280
The soil causes release of carbon into the atmosphere.

93
00:05:11.281 --> 00:05:15.480
Soil carbon is a third of all the carbon in the atmosphere from the way we farm

94
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.550
and contributor to climate change. It, it actually destroys the ecosystem.

95
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.280
Pollinators and bees are killed. Who's paying for that, right?

96
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.130
It destroys the rivers, lakes and oceans. As I mentioned,

97
00:05:26.131 --> 00:05:28.170
and creates dead zones because of the fertilizer runoff,

98
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.710
then the food that's produced is the raw materials for junk food and for soda.

99
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.080
Then we pay for that to be given at the tune of about

100
00:05:37.081 --> 00:05:41.100
$75 billion a year to the poor in food stamp products.

101
00:05:41.101 --> 00:05:45.330
75% of that is junk food. Seven, 10% is soda. So they eat that.

102
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.400
And then we pay for Medicare Medicaid on the backend when they have diabetes and

103
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.980
obesity related illnesses. And so we're,

104
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.120
we're not paying for the economic or the,

105
00:05:55.121 --> 00:06:00.080
the impact on our environment and climate where we're paying for it literally

106
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:02.990
four times. And that price is not in the can of Coke.

107
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:06.070
It should be maybe a hundred dollars for a can of Coke when you include all

108
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.910
those costs.

109
00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.900
<v 1>Right? Okay. You gave me a lot there. First. I have to jump back for a second.</v>

110
00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.760
You're calling it denote.

111
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:17.740
I always thought it was Dan and American standard to know. Okay. Now. All right.

112
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.530
All right. That was sticking with me this whole time. So I'm glad we got it.

113
00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.010
Got it. Got the important thing out of the way you say tomato. I say tomato.

114
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.540
Okay. So you did grow up in Spain now, now it's a European company,

115
00:06:28.541 --> 00:06:30.790
so that's how they say it. Okay. Fair enough. Uh,

116
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.830
that actually is perfect segue to my next question,

117
00:06:32.831 --> 00:06:35.350
which is how much of this is uniquely an American problem?

118
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.750
<v 0>Oh my God. Yes.</v>

119
00:06:37.751 --> 00:06:42.460
We have basically created the worst diet in the world and are exporting it to

120
00:06:42.461 --> 00:06:46.090
every country on the planet. And what's frightening to me is, you know,

121
00:06:46.091 --> 00:06:49.990
I was in China in 1984. It was no obesity. It was no diabetes.

122
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.270
Now they have a hundred plus million diabetics in

123
00:06:55.271 --> 00:06:58.930
China. It's, it's the number one country in the world with diabetics.

124
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:00.243
There is that.

125
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.840
<v 1>That's probably just a numbers game though. Right?</v>

126
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.850
Just cause the amount of [inaudible].

127
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.450
<v 0>It used to be one in 50. Oh, okay. So now it's one in 10. Okay. So yeah,</v>

128
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.960
it's one in 10. Yeah. India is number two. And in the middle East,

129
00:07:10.961 --> 00:07:14.440
it's one in four. I have diabetes, uh, in the developing world,

130
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.460
80% of the diabetics and, uh,

131
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.030
and obesity related issues and chronic disease are in the developing world, 80%.

132
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.100
So, uh, in countries like Africa in India, in China,

133
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.800
junk food, fast food is aspirational.

134
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.710
If you want to take your date out in America for a good time,

135
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.330
you don't take her to McDonald's.

136
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:39.070
But that's what they do in the developing world. KFC is a premium brand.

137
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.110
McDonald's is a premium man. Domino's.

138
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.470
<v 1>My brother-in-law was living in El Salvador doing some work,</v>

139
00:07:44.471 --> 00:07:48.880
some research work down there. And we went down there and basically, you know,

140
00:07:48.881 --> 00:07:52.480
I saw a Wendy's and there was a lot of Wendy's I think it was Wednesday Wendy's

141
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.130
and a couple other chain things.

142
00:07:54.131 --> 00:07:56.170
And those were the nights that's where everyone wanted to go.

143
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.480
Cause that was sort of thought of as the nice stuff. Yeah.

144
00:07:58.870 --> 00:07:59.870
Which is a very backwards.

145
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:01.391
<v 0>For you.</v>

146
00:08:01.391 --> 00:08:04.660
And these kinds of shows because this kind of conversation wouldn't happen on

147
00:08:04.661 --> 00:08:07.630
traditional TV. I was watching good morning America of the day.

148
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.870
And I was in a green room about to go on a show and I don't want you to watch

149
00:08:10.871 --> 00:08:11.171
TV.

150
00:08:11.171 --> 00:08:16.150
And there was the whole segment where they gave free Wendy's breakfast burgers

151
00:08:16.151 --> 00:08:18.820
or whatever the junk they give them to the entire audience.

152
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.790
And then they were talking about these great Wendy's breakfast things,

153
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:23.950
and they were eating, the hosts were eating them, right.

154
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:25.360
They had a big ad after.

155
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.810
<v 1>Because you know, the host would never eat that stuff normally.</v>

156
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:29.763
No they wouldn't.

157
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.000
<v 0>But the media is co-opted who funds the media and advertising today,</v>

158
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.850
big pharma and food, big food.

159
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.390
