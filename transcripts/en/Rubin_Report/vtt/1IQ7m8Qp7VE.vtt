00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:08.423
<v 0>Hello.</v>

2
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.020
<v 1>Bins and other carbon based life forms. It's me, Dave Rubin.</v>

3
00:00:12.021 --> 00:00:16.760
And this is the Rubin report direct message for today, October 14th, 2020.

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.970
And don't worry people. There's no shortage of things to talk about.

5
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.440
I don't know if you've heard about this,

6
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.700
but there is a confirmation hearing for a Supreme court justice and the

7
00:00:25.701 --> 00:00:28.910
senators just made complete fools of themselves.

8
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.440
We're only going to show one clip though,

9
00:00:30.441 --> 00:00:35.090
because I don't want to bludgeon you with clips of ridiculous pompous

10
00:00:35.091 --> 00:00:39.710
self-serving senators, uh, making fools of themselves. So I only picked one.

11
00:00:39.711 --> 00:00:44.540
I picked the most special of all the clips. So we're going to talk about that.

12
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.790
Uh, then we are going to talk about a video that was going viral last

13
00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:53.390
night, that you are not going to see on mainstream media. There,

14
00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:56.330
there is a rather incredible video, uh,

15
00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.370
of a young black man on a Southwest flight from last

16
00:01:01.371 --> 00:01:02.960
night. I think it's from yesterday afternoon.

17
00:01:02.961 --> 00:01:06.470
Actually the video went viral a little later in the evening, uh,

18
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.610
and he's being kicked off the flight because he was eating with his mask down.

19
00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:12.950
Now you're allowed to eat with your mask down and you're allowed to drink with

20
00:01:12.951 --> 00:01:14.750
your mass down, et cetera, et cetera. Uh,

21
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.570
but you might find this part interesting. Uh,

22
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.580
he had a Trump 2020 mask and he had a black voices for Trump

23
00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:25.040
hat. Do you think that might've had something to do with it?

24
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.770
He was then kicked off by, uh,

25
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.300
by a white employee of Southwest and the woman

26
00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:35.360
videotaping. It was actually traveling with him. Uh,

27
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.720
she teaches constitution all over the country. They were traveling,

28
00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:41.810
he was doing some video work for her and they were traveling to talk about the

29
00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:43.880
constitution together. Uh,

30
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.660
I actually just interviewed them a little bit before we're taping this.

31
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.640
I got assurances from them that nothing that you don't see in the video happened

32
00:01:52.641 --> 00:01:57.020
that would have been warranted to, uh, allow them to be kicked off. Uh,

33
00:01:57.021 --> 00:01:58.790
so I interviewed both of them. Uh,

34
00:01:58.791 --> 00:02:02.540
it's just about 12 minute or so interview that I think you guys will find really

35
00:02:02.541 --> 00:02:05.000
interesting. And, and, and the reason I wanted to do it of course,

36
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.980
is because we know that if a young black man was kicked off a

37
00:02:09.981 --> 00:02:12.650
flight in normal circumstances,

38
00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:16.130
this is the type of story that the media would say, we're a systemically racist.

39
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.580
This is racism. Southwest is racist. Everyone should be fired, et cetera,

40
00:02:19.581 --> 00:02:20.240
et cetera.

41
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.600
But because he was wearing a Trump mask and a black voices for Trump hat,

42
00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:26.780
somehow I'm guessing this aint going to be on CNN today.

43
00:02:26.781 --> 00:02:28.550
This ain't going to be on MSNBC.

44
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.770
And thus it leaves Dave Rubin to have to tell you stories of things that

45
00:02:33.771 --> 00:02:36.620
you should know about. Because as I keep saying to you guys,

46
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.240
one type of fake news is the stuff that they won't show you because it doesn't

47
00:02:41.241 --> 00:02:44.480
fit the narrative. So I had a really interesting interview with Phillip who's,

48
00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:47.060
the young man and the woman that he was traveling with. Uh,

49
00:02:47.061 --> 00:02:49.970
and then the third story I wanted to do today is actually not current events.

50
00:02:49.971 --> 00:02:51.530
You know, I always tell you guys,

51
00:02:51.531 --> 00:02:54.200
I don't want you guys to just be obsessed with current events.

52
00:02:54.201 --> 00:02:55.790
I don't want to be obsessed with current events,

53
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.310
but sometimes something comes across my desk.

54
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.440
That feels right for the moment that doesn't have anything to do with

55
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.870
necessarily what's happening today.

56
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:09.480
And yesterday saw a video posted by Rita Panahi,

57
00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:12.960
who's an Australian journalist, uh, who I've had on the show.

58
00:03:12.961 --> 00:03:16.410
And I've been on her show when I was in Australia. And she's one of the really,

59
00:03:16.411 --> 00:03:18.570
really great, she's a journalist,

60
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.750
she's an actual journalist who I don't have to put air quotes around when I say

61
00:03:21.751 --> 00:03:24.750
journalism. That's, that's the best thing I can say about a journalist. Uh,

62
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.130
but she, she retweeted a video, uh, that was originally from firing line,

63
00:03:29.131 --> 00:03:31.860
which was an interview show, uh, decades ago.

64
00:03:31.861 --> 00:03:36.630
And there's an interview with former British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher.

65
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.260
And in this two minute interview, which we're going to show you the clip of,

66
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.560
she talks about how the labor movement,

67
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.880
which in effect is sort of our democratic party here, uh, in America.

68
00:03:47.881 --> 00:03:48.870
So meaning our left,

69
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.000
how it sort of always gets led by its worst elements and that how a small group

70
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.040
of people can sort of expand and keep everybody in a constant state of

71
00:03:59.041 --> 00:04:01.790
fear. And that's why the thing gets so out of control. And I was watching it,

72
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.850
knowing, yes,

73
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.770
this is literally exactly what I've been saying about our democratic party and

74
00:04:07.771 --> 00:04:12.600
why the good Democrats have nothing to do to stand up,

75
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.590
or they just have no ability basically to stand up against the radical left

76
00:04:16.591 --> 00:04:20.940
elements and the progressives and the Marxists and the rest and the rest of it.

77
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.650
Uh, but, or we get to that.

78
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.220
I wanted to tell you guys a little bit about ancestry.com, you know,

79
00:04:26.221 --> 00:04:30.090
all about them. Uh, but there are many paths to finding your family story,

80
00:04:30.091 --> 00:04:34.890
whichever way you choose tracing your family generations back with a family

81
00:04:34.891 --> 00:04:37.710
tree or uncovering your ethnicity with ancestry.

82
00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:42.390
DNA is easy to get started with ancestry and ancestry.

83
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.770
DNA test tells you where your ancestors are from an ancestries,

84
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.290
billions of records and millions of family trees.

85
00:04:49.291 --> 00:04:51.540
Let you discover their personal stories.

86
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.380
You could find a famous relative or perhaps a photo of your great-grandma's,

87
00:04:55.381 --> 00:04:59.490
a little girl, whatever you find, it's sure to change the whole way.

88
00:04:59.491 --> 00:05:01.860
You look at your family history and yourself,

89
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.390
after all the story of your family is the story of you researching your history

90
00:05:06.391 --> 00:05:08.220
as a fun activity for the whole family.

91
00:05:08.221 --> 00:05:12.180
And the stories you learn about your shared past can bring you closer together.

92
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.220
Ancestry DNA can reveal ethnic origins and provide historical details that bring

93
00:05:17.221 --> 00:05:20.610
your unique family story to life ancestry DNA.

94
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.560
Doesn't just tell you which countries you're from,

95
00:05:22.561 --> 00:05:25.470
but can also pinpoint the specific regions within them.

96
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.890
Giving you insightful geographic detail about your history,

97
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.480
trace the paths of your recent ancestors and learn how and why your family moved

98
00:05:33.481 --> 00:05:35.250
from place to place around the world.

99
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.600
No other DNA tests delivers such a unique interactive experience.

100
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.570
It's easy to start making discoveries with ancestry,

That's ancestry.com/rubin. And now back to me,

106
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.670
all right, here we go. People, uh, the big story of course, of the day,

107
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.280
certainly of yesterday, and it's going to roll into today and,

108
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:13.140
and finish up throughout the week, uh, is the,

109
00:06:13.141 --> 00:06:15.920
the confirmation hearings of Amy Coney Barrett.

110
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.500
Now on the broad side of this first off,

111
00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:21.590
I don't expect all of you guys to be watching all of these things. I'm amazed.

112
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:24.810
You know, one of the problems we have right now is because so many of us are,

113
00:06:24.811 --> 00:06:28.250
are trapped at home and we're working from home. You've got people,

114
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.220
good people who have lives and children,

115
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:34.940
and should be out doing things and talking to other people and being productive.

116
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.370
And instead they're watching CSPAN all day. I mean,

117
00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:40.010
watching confirmation hearings for a Supreme court justice,

118
00:06:40.011 --> 00:06:44.750
that's not to diminish the importance of a Supreme court justice,

119
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.400
uh, or even have a hearing,

120
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.550
even though we know the outcome of the hearing already, right? Like again,

121
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.860
the Republicans have the votes.

122
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:55.730
This woman is being confirmed as a Supreme court judge.

123
00:06:55.731 --> 00:06:59.990
So everything you're watching when Cory Booker is crying and everything else,

124
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.700
it's all theater that doesn't diminish the important issues that they're

125
00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:07.190
sort of talking about. But there's a,

126
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:10.910
there's a whole lot of just sort of drivel and theater.

127
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.180
And the fact that everyone is just watching this thing for hours,

128
00:07:14.181 --> 00:07:17.270
like you don't need to watch it for hours. If you could just get little,

129
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:22.190
little bites, you can get a flavor of what's going on in the country.

130
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.660
And, uh, and,

131
00:07:23.661 --> 00:07:27.020
and sort of what the important issues are that we're talking about in any event.

132
00:07:27.021 --> 00:07:31.040
My, my bumper sticker review of what's been going on, um,

133
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:36.110
is that she is absolutely an excellent candidate. She will,

134
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.260
she will, let's put it this way.

135
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:43.550
She will be looking at the constitution, not as,

136
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.100
as I said to you guys yesterday, as she wants it to be,

137
00:07:46.101 --> 00:07:49.880
but as it was written and that's how she will make her judicial decisions.

138
00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:52.430
I think that's the best thing you can ask for these people.

139
00:07:52.431 --> 00:07:55.460
You don't want judges legislating from the bench.

140
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:59.630
You want them analyzing the law as it is. So beyond that,

141
00:07:59.631 --> 00:08:01.970
she also strikes me as a, as a pretty decent human being.

142
00:08:01.971 --> 00:08:05.750
I think she has seven children, two of them adopted from Haiti,

143
00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:09.400
which we would have thought it was a good thing until the last week or so.

144
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:13.430
And some crazy radical leftists have been saying it's because she's a colonizer

145
00:08:13.431 --> 00:08:16.370
or something like that. But she seems like a good family person.

146
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.210
There's the wonderful moment yesterday where she holds up her notes and she's

147
00:08:20.211 --> 00:08:21.080
got nothing there.

148
00:08:21.081 --> 00:08:24.680
And all of the senators have essays and books and all this stuff in front of

149
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:27.560
them. She seems totally competent. And all of those things,

150
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:32.600
and even John King on CNN yesterday said that in normal

151
00:08:32.601 --> 00:08:36.650
times, this is someone who would get something like 70 votes. Uh,

152
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.360
she's basically going to get 51.

153
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.310
Cause unfortunately it's going to be on partisan lines,

154
00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:44.540
which is a much bigger topic to talk about relative to just how everything is

155
00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:47.780
sort of devolved into Republican versus Democrat. Anyway,

156
00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:53.420
there was a bunch of viral videos yesterday of the senators asking her sort of

157
00:08:53.421 --> 00:08:54.740
ridiculous questions.

158
00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:59.970
Corey Booker literally almost as he was crying like this overly emotive

159
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.210
thing, asking her if she's a white supremacist.

160
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:08.250
And he basically said he had to ask her because our president won't deny white

161
00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:11.910
supremacists, white supremacism. I mean, it's just,

162
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:16.020
it's just so stupid, so much of it, but I thought the stupidest,

163
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:21.570
it wasn't Corey Booker, the stupidest one was Senator Massey Hirono.

164
00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:25.050
She is from Hawaii. And, uh, well,

165
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.000
let's just go to the video tape.

166
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.880
<v 2>Uh, to ensure the fitness of nominees for a lifetime appointment to the federal</v>

167
00:09:31.881 --> 00:09:35.780
bench or to any of the other, uh, positions of, uh,

168
00:09:35.781 --> 00:09:37.610
for any of the committees on which they appear.

169
00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:42.260
I asked each nominee these two questions and I will ask them, have you,

170
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.390
since you became a legal adult,

171
00:09:44.391 --> 00:09:49.250
have you ever made unwanted requests for sexual favors or committed any

172
00:09:49.251 --> 00:09:53.810
verbal or physical Harris' mint or assault of a sexual nature? Now, Senator,

173
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.650
who will,

174
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:59.120
have you ever faced discipline or entered into a settlement related to this kind

175
00:09:59.121 --> 00:10:03.890
of conduct now, Senator judge bear,

176
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:08.420
do you think it is appropriate for justices to consider real world

177
00:10:08.421 --> 00:10:13.250
impacts and their decision-making as justice Ginsburg noted

178
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:15.590
and a number of her dissents?

179
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:19.640
<v 1>Okay. So to be clear as to what just happened there,</v>

180
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.890
Mazzy just asked a woman who has never been accused of sexual

181
00:10:24.891 --> 00:10:29.420
favors or committing any verbal or physical harassment or assault of

182
00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:32.390
anyone in a sexual nature of otherwise,

183
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:35.600
if she's done any of that stuff, now Masih saying,

184
00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:37.070
this is what she asks everybody,

185
00:10:37.071 --> 00:10:40.880
but just this type of stupidity,

186
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:45.710
it's just theater for the click for the moment

187
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:50.990
that can possibly go viral for it to get listed in Twitter's

188
00:10:50.991 --> 00:10:51.824
trends.

189
00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:56.510
So that someone out there will somehow associate Amy Coney

190
00:10:56.511 --> 00:11:00.860
Barrett with sexual favors or physical or sexual

191
00:11:00.861 --> 00:11:05.030
harassment or something like that. And it's just nonsense again,

192
00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:08.510
she is going to be confirmed.

193
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.260
There's really no argument against whether she should be confirmed or not.

194
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:13.220
Now what you could say,

195
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:17.480
what a lot of the Democrats were doing yesterday was they were saying, well,

196
00:11:17.481 --> 00:11:21.470
you know, you might flip, uh, Roe V Wade, which again,

197
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:24.290
it's very important to say this because people are very confused as to what Roe

198
00:11:24.291 --> 00:11:27.950
V. Wade is Roe V. Wade did not make abortion legal.

199
00:11:27.951 --> 00:11:31.340
What it did was he took it out of the States and it made it federally illegal.

200
00:11:31.341 --> 00:11:35.150
Right? So before that, the States all made their own decision. Um, so as a,

201
00:11:35.151 --> 00:11:38.600
as a small government guy and someone that believes in federalism for me,

202
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.170
even though as many of you know, and by the way, many of you criticize me for,

203
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:46.520
uh, I lay out an, uh, begrudgingly pro-choice argument in my book,

204
00:11:46.521 --> 00:11:49.040
which is that in the first trimester, you leave it up to the woman and I,

205
00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:51.140
and I lay out all the reasons for that. And, um,

206
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.820
and I'm more than happy to continue that discussion disagree with some of you

207
00:11:54.821 --> 00:11:58.360
guys on that. That's just fine. Um, but what the,

208
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:01.780
what the democratic senators were doing basically were saying, well,

209
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:06.010
if you want to reverse that, then you, you are not qualified.

210
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:08.620
And th that's not first off, she can't, pre-judge a case, right?

211
00:12:08.621 --> 00:12:11.260
There's no case on the way up that would even get it there.

212
00:12:11.261 --> 00:12:14.140
Now there could be in the future, but she can't prejudge the case.

213
00:12:14.141 --> 00:12:17.080
So they're trying to get her to pre-judge a case. Um,

214
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:22.180
and so that in and of itself is bad, but also the idea that just because a case,

215
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.430
just because there's a,

216
00:12:23.431 --> 00:12:26.710
a decision that has been made in the past the Roe V Wade decision,

217
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.180
just because the decision has been made in the past that a judge isn't allowed

218
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:36.130
to potentially disagree with the decision that that doesn't really make sense.

219
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.780
So the two, they were trying to get her on,

220
00:12:37.781 --> 00:12:40.630
basically the implication was you hate women because you're going to want to

221
00:12:40.631 --> 00:12:43.900
flip Roe V. Wade, even though she has not said that, um,

222
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:48.130
and that she will further dismantle Obamacare, the affordable care act,

223
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:51.250
even though she has not specifically said that. And, and of course,

224
00:12:51.251 --> 00:12:54.970
will there be cases that get up to the Supreme court about the affordable care

225
00:12:54.971 --> 00:12:57.340
act? Of course there will, but also it's,

226
00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:01.330
it's extremely important to remember guys, and don't forget this,

227
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.370
that judges sometimes who were brought in and thought of as conservative ended

228
00:13:05.371 --> 00:13:08.410
up doing things that are not conservative and judges who are thought of as

229
00:13:08.411 --> 00:13:12.100
liberal end up doing things that are not thought of as liberal, right? I mean,

230
00:13:12.101 --> 00:13:12.340
this,

231
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:16.000
this happened when Obamacare was passed in the first place with John Roberts.

232
00:13:16.001 --> 00:13:20.770
So these things do happen, but the, the, the bumper sticker,

233
00:13:20.771 --> 00:13:25.000
as I said before, is that she is going to be confirmed.

234
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:29.710
She strikes, I think pretty much everybody as a decent person and just watching,

235
00:13:29.711 --> 00:13:33.100
unfortunately, the Democrats, you know,

236
00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:37.180
are you a white supremacist? Have you ever sexually assaulted anyone? It's like,

237
00:13:37.181 --> 00:13:40.390
man, you guys really blew your load with Brett Kavanaugh.

238
00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.740
You went all in on trying to destroy a human being with Brett Kavanaugh.

239
00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:46.510
And now this is what you're left with.

240
00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.630
You're left with nothing you're left with knowing that you're holding a farce

241
00:13:49.631 --> 00:13:51.940
hearing, cause she's going to be confirmed.

242
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.050
And the fact that you're just throwing out crazy nonsense.

243
00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.740
Cause cause you got nothing left to do. All right guys,

244
00:13:58.741 --> 00:14:02.670
before we move to the second story, I want to talk about second thoughts.

245
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.840
The board game I'm even holding it up, right? That's pretty good. Uh,

246
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:11.580
this game is seriously, seriously fun. And I'm not just saying it. And uh,

247
00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:14.930
the makers of the game are, are fans of the show. Uh, so I'm,

248
00:14:14.931 --> 00:14:17.850
I'm thrilled that they're, that they're supporting us here guys.

249
00:14:17.851 --> 00:14:20.580
Second thoughts is this year's new favorite party game.

250
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:24.600
That'll be sure to be a hit with your friends and family on game night,

251
00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:28.500
the play of the game calls for each team to quickly create a list of words for

252
00:14:28.501 --> 00:14:29.250
their opponents,

253
00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:33.930
the decipher leading to hilarious puzzlement and laughter simply put it's a

254
00:14:33.931 --> 00:14:38.220
classical word guessing game with a unique twists that allows players to

255
00:14:38.221 --> 00:14:42.120
personalize the content with their voluminous sense of words.

256
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:45.870
Smithery just, they're witty and warped imaginations.

257
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:49.980
Each round of second thoughts is a hilarious high-speed attempt to stump.

258
00:14:49.981 --> 00:14:50.814
The other team.

259
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.890
Both teams create a list of five things using the letters revealed from the

260
00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.960
colored dice, be witty and wise,

261
00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:00.530
but don't take too long because time is not on your side and the amount of time

262
00:15:00.531 --> 00:15:04.130
it takes your team to create the list is exactly how much time your opponents

263
00:15:04.131 --> 00:15:06.110
get to guess them. Second thoughts,

264
00:15:06.111 --> 00:15:09.560
the quick thinking versus fast talking party game. How am I doing?

265
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:12.670
I'm fast talking, not too bad. Get yours today at second. Thoughts,

266
00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.330
the game.com. That's second thoughts,

267
00:15:14.331 --> 00:15:19.190
the game.com or at your local target store. And now back to me doing the show,

268
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:24.380
all right, here we go. So the next story that I want to cover today is this,

269
00:15:24.381 --> 00:15:28.040
this viral video that hopefully you've seen already. Uh,

270
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:31.880
and as I mentioned in a, in about an hour or so from posting this,

271
00:15:31.881 --> 00:15:33.860
we are going to post an interview with, uh,

272
00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:37.790
the guy that you're going to see here in this viral video and the woman who

273
00:15:37.791 --> 00:15:42.500
videotaped it. This is video from a Southwest airlines flight from yesterday

274
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.930
where a young black man who he just happens to be black. Okay.

275
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:53.060
Uh, he is, uh, he's eating, uh, some nuts. I think it is.

276
00:15:53.061 --> 00:15:54.050
He's eating some nuts.

277
00:15:54.051 --> 00:15:58.970
And I think he had a cup of coffee on a Southwest flight and he was kicked off

278
00:15:58.971 --> 00:16:03.230
a flight. The flight attendant reported that he wasn't wearing his mask.

279
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.810
And next thing you know, you've got, you know,

280
00:16:05.811 --> 00:16:08.030
the higher up at Southwest they're kicking them off.

281
00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:11.930
The guy happens to be white. That's kicking him off. He happens to be black.

282
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:16.520
I don't really care about the racial element of any of this, except that the,

283
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:20.900
uh, the little asterisk to the story is that he had a Trump 20,

284
00:16:20.901 --> 00:16:25.130
20 mask at a young and a black voices for Trump, uh, hat.

285
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:28.610
And now we know this does not fit the narrative, right?

286
00:16:28.611 --> 00:16:33.110
This doesn't fit the narrative of racism because somehow if you're black and

287
00:16:33.111 --> 00:16:35.540
you're a Trump supporter, then nothing is racist.

288
00:16:35.541 --> 00:16:38.750
But we know if he wasn't a Trump supporter, then everything is racist. I mean,

289
00:16:38.751 --> 00:16:43.190
it's the same old, silly nonsense. So we are going to post an out, uh,

290
00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.140
an interview. It's a very short interview.

291
00:16:45.141 --> 00:16:47.660
I wanted to get their feelings about what happened because it wasn't going to be

292
00:16:47.661 --> 00:16:51.290
covered by mainstream. We're going to post that interview in about an hour. Uh,

293
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.410
but here's just a portion of the, of the viral video.

294
00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:07.720
<v 3>Can you tell us the policy that prevents them from taking his mask off while</v>

295
00:17:07.721 --> 00:17:08.620
he's eating, please

296
00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.030
present the crew has denied. Okay. But you're seeing him with eating.

297
00:17:16.031 --> 00:17:17.590
So please tell me the policy,

298
00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:22.300
tell the crew to tell me the policy that says he cannot eat with his mask

299
00:17:22.301 --> 00:17:25.510
off. Here you go.

300
00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:30.010
Say that he put his mask on. He took it off when he started eating the nuts.

301
00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.640
That were good. I was sitting right here. So

302
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.140
it's not a, it's not a publicity stunt.

303
00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:42.070
It's trying to make you follow policy indiscriminately

304
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.250
and impartially. Okay.

305
00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:50.580
So do you follow your policy and impartially,

306
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:53.400
or do you just do this for people whose message you don't like?

307
00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.810
<v 1>Okay. So just to be clear again, uh,</v>

308
00:17:56.811 --> 00:18:01.400
when I talked to Phillip and, uh, and the lady who, uh,

309
00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:05.780
videotape that they have assured me that he was not doing anything untoward,

310
00:18:05.781 --> 00:18:08.390
he had not gotten into a fight or anything else before that.

311
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:12.170
And I will give you one other little, uh, preview of the interview,

312
00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:16.520
which is that they're not looking to Sue. They want to find out what happened.

313
00:18:16.521 --> 00:18:19.880
They'd like to get down to the end of it. Actually the, the woman filming,

314
00:18:19.881 --> 00:18:21.920
they were, they were traveling because, uh,

315
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:25.850
she teaches the constitution to various groups throughout the country.

316
00:18:25.851 --> 00:18:29.120
And he was doing some video work for her. So these are not people. I mean,

317
00:18:29.121 --> 00:18:31.220
I think you'll see when you see the interview, Phillip,

318
00:18:31.221 --> 00:18:34.190
this is not a guy that was looking for publicity and you can even see it.

319
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.260
You can even see it in that video, right?

320
00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:41.000
Like we see other videos of people going bananas on planes and screaming at

321
00:18:41.001 --> 00:18:43.250
people and everything else because they just want attention.

322
00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.770
And this clearly was not the case with the guy. So that'll,

323
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:48.740
that'll be up in about an hour. And I just want to cover, uh,

324
00:18:48.741 --> 00:18:53.270
one other thing today, and this is not pure current events. Um,

325
00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:57.380
but I did see a video that was, uh, shared by Rita. Panahi, who,

326
00:18:57.381 --> 00:19:01.460
as I mentioned is a, is a journalist, uh, in Australia,

327
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:04.400
an actual journalist. And it was a video from firing line,

328
00:19:04.401 --> 00:19:06.890
which was an old interview show back in the day.

329
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:09.830
And they had interviewed Margaret Thatcher.

330
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:13.160
Who's the former prime minister of England.

331
00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:18.410
And I thought what she said in this interview from about three decades ago

332
00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:23.360
is so applicable to what is happening with the Democrats and the left of

333
00:19:23.361 --> 00:19:24.680
today. So let's take a look.

334
00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:26.570
<v 4>In 1959,</v>

335
00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:31.430
you could count the number of extreme left-wingers in the labor party.

336
00:19:31.431 --> 00:19:35.420
Certainly on two happens, there are perhaps seven or eight of them.

337
00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:36.970
We knew who they were.

338
00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:41.240
We all rather thought that this was just an example of the X centricity of

339
00:19:41.241 --> 00:19:45.800
British politics that, that allowed, that kind of thing was yes. Yes.

340
00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:50.660
And in a way it was rather proud that this thing happened now after the

341
00:19:50.661 --> 00:19:53.420
last election, there are more than 80 of them.

342
00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:58.280
So you see you've gone from a situation in which you had a very few left winners

343
00:19:58.281 --> 00:20:02.310
in the labor party, the one in which you've had over 80. No,

344
00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:07.970
no, no, no. I haven't even developed a thesis yet. Now.

345
00:20:07.971 --> 00:20:09.950
You'll know you've traveled the world. As I have.

346
00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:14.330
The one thing about left-wing politicians is they're always fanatical.

347
00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.770
They never let go. It's their religion. They go on and on.

348
00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:22.370
And although there are a minority of the labor party,

349
00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.100
but 80 to a hundred out of some 300,

350
00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:27.920
they tend to dominate them in view.

351
00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:33.410
It's the left-wing that I think has led the policies of the labor

352
00:20:33.411 --> 00:20:37.820
party and your social Democrats have not really argued with them.

353
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:42.320
Although they've been in the majority, they've not been in their ascendancy.

354
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:45.380
<v 1>Okay. So what she's describing there, I mean, man,</v>

355
00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:50.260
doesn't that sound exactly what has happened with the Democrats, right?

356
00:20:50.261 --> 00:20:53.380
That there was this like small, loud contingency,

357
00:20:53.381 --> 00:20:57.550
and then it started getting bigger and then sort of the old school Democrats

358
00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.340
just withered beneath it. I mean that,

359
00:20:59.341 --> 00:21:02.500
that's almost everything that I've been talking about for the last couple of

360
00:21:02.501 --> 00:21:07.000
years and how the good liberals, whatever the remaining old school,

361
00:21:07.001 --> 00:21:11.380
good liberals are the liberals who don't want the government to do everything

362
00:21:11.381 --> 00:21:15.580
who don't think everything is racist, who don't want to burn everything down.

363
00:21:15.581 --> 00:21:20.260
They seem to have no defense against the radical new

364
00:21:20.261 --> 00:21:22.300
progressive Marxists lefties, right?

365
00:21:22.301 --> 00:21:26.710
They have no defense against the AOC and the Ilhan. Omar's,

366
00:21:26.711 --> 00:21:30.640
it's not because the AOC and the Ilhan Omar is have better ideas.

367
00:21:30.641 --> 00:21:34.110
It's because they bark loudly and they call everybody racist. And,

368
00:21:34.111 --> 00:21:36.920
and the liberals, unfortunately, they,

369
00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:39.460
they cower in the name of that.

370
00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:44.350
And that's why so many of the liberal institutions are

371
00:21:44.351 --> 00:21:47.260
crumbling because once you basically say, Hey,

372
00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:51.970
however you feel about something is just as important as what the truth might

373
00:21:51.971 --> 00:21:52.301
be. Well,

374
00:21:52.301 --> 00:21:56.560
then everyone can come in with whatever their crazy theory of the day is.

375
00:21:56.561 --> 00:21:59.020
And then you'll watch all of the institutions burn.

376
00:21:59.021 --> 00:22:01.690
So the line that I really thought was great there, uh,

377
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:06.040
is that you're saying the one thing with left-wing politicians is that they're

378
00:22:06.041 --> 00:22:10.150
fanatical, it's their religion. And we've talked about this,

379
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:13.510
a bunch on the show. And I often quote my, my friend and former guest,

380
00:22:13.511 --> 00:22:15.160
Peter Boghossian, uh,

381
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:19.750
who has talked about woke ism as a secular religion,

382
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.920
meaning they've thrown away all, all other religious belief,

383
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:26.590
all belief outside of themselves. Right.

384
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:31.420
And what they believe in is that they can create a world through

385
00:22:31.421 --> 00:22:34.930
laws, through creating a system that they install,

386
00:22:34.931 --> 00:22:39.640
who is more powerful than who and who can take and who can give and all of those

387
00:22:39.641 --> 00:22:44.050
things that they can create a system that, that they, they don't mean religion.

388
00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:46.780
It's, it's their, it's their philosophical worldview of everything.

389
00:22:46.781 --> 00:22:50.110
This is also partly why, why generally right now,

390
00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:55.120
and I see this consistently is that people on the left seem to be far more

391
00:22:55.121 --> 00:22:59.650
hysterical and angry and mean

392
00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:04.360
really then people on the right. And there's a fundamental reasoning for that.

393
00:23:04.361 --> 00:23:05.740
And the reasoning is they've,

394
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:10.390
they've traded in any other belief for the belief in the system that they can

395
00:23:10.391 --> 00:23:15.310
create. And that, that is a type of religious thinking. Now, in most religions,

396
00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.680
you have some sort of redemption narrative, right?

397
00:23:17.681 --> 00:23:20.770
There's some sort of forgiveness that you can do, but,

398
00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.410
but actually in this new woke religion,

399
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:28.210
especially if you are a white heterosexual, uh, Christian man,

400
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:32.590
you have to bow forever. And I don't know about you guys out there,

401
00:23:32.591 --> 00:23:37.420
but I refuse to live by someone else's

402
00:23:37.421 --> 00:23:41.770
rules and bow to them forever. And that's why the walkaway movement,

403
00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.140
meaning the people that are leaving the left.

404
00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.480
And it doesn't mean you're a card carrying Republican necessarily,

405
00:23:47.481 --> 00:23:49.910
but the people who are going, Oh, you know, those conservatives,

406
00:23:49.911 --> 00:23:52.400
they ain't so bad. Those libertarians, they ain't so bad.

407
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.630
Something interesting is happening in this, in this Trump space.

408
00:23:56.631 --> 00:23:59.210
And as you guys know, I just stumbled upon a Trump rally the other day.

409
00:23:59.211 --> 00:24:00.590
And it was absolutely incredible.

410
00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:04.100
And there was no racist there or anything else like that. Um,

411
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:08.480
you can see why the walkaway movement is, is picking up so much momentum.

412
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:11.480
Um, and, and the blogs, it movement and the rest of it.

413
00:24:11.481 --> 00:24:14.180
You can see it because young people are going, wait a minute, wait a minute.

414
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:16.910
When did being on the left,

415
00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:21.530
which used to be about free speech and it used to be cool. And, and,

416
00:24:21.531 --> 00:24:26.510
and artists, why were artists and musicians and comedians and all of the,

417
00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:29.480
all of the things that make up culture, why were they all left these?

418
00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:33.200
Because the left used to be the home for free expression,

419
00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.020
but as they've become religious in nature,

420
00:24:36.021 --> 00:24:39.830
which is exactly what Margaret Thatcher is talking about.

421
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.050
They've tried to stifle dissent,

422
00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:46.610
show me where there's a healthy debate of ideas where there's healthy dissent,

423
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:51.350
uh, on the left. It basically does not exist,

424
00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:55.250
which is partly also why Joe Biden seems incapable of,

425
00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:58.640
of answering a question honestly, about what he thinks about anything,

426
00:24:58.641 --> 00:25:02.030
because he knows his own base will destroy him. And again,

427
00:25:02.031 --> 00:25:06.050
that is not to say people that Reuben, you become such a Trump, blah, blah,

428
00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.710
blah. Or you went from being on the left and now you're just a conservative or

429
00:25:09.711 --> 00:25:14.690
something like that. And it's like, okay, if being gay, married,

430
00:25:14.691 --> 00:25:17.000
and pro choice and against the death penalty,

431
00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:21.930
if all of that fits within the conservative tent, um, or the,

432
00:25:21.931 --> 00:25:23.000
the tent on the right, well,

433
00:25:23.001 --> 00:25:26.930
that's a much better place to be because we can all agree to disagree and the

434
00:25:26.931 --> 00:25:27.440
rest of it.

435
00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.470
And I'm not trying to convince anyone that I'm right on all of the issues I

436
00:25:30.471 --> 00:25:32.150
wrote a whole, a whole book about it.

437
00:25:32.151 --> 00:25:35.060
You don't have to agree with me about all of this stuff. Um,

438
00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:38.270
but I know that a certain set of people are willing to talk about it while a

439
00:25:38.271 --> 00:25:42.620
certain set of people have become fanatical and religious in their belief.

440
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:43.101
Anyway,

441
00:25:43.101 --> 00:25:47.600
I thought the clip was worth playing because not only was this roughly 30 years

442
00:25:47.601 --> 00:25:49.160
ago, that Margaret Thatcher was talking about it,

443
00:25:49.161 --> 00:25:52.580
but she was obviously talking about it, uh, you know, with, uh,

444
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:56.570
within the lens of what was happening politically in England. And it's like,

445
00:25:56.571 --> 00:25:59.750
you know, for everybody that wakes up and thinks, Oh, this is so unique,

446
00:25:59.751 --> 00:26:01.580
what's happening right now is just so unique.

447
00:26:01.581 --> 00:26:03.620
It's never happened before and it'll never happen again.

448
00:26:03.621 --> 00:26:05.390
And it's the worst time ever. Well,

449
00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:10.160
these things are cyclical and they happened before it happened with the labor

450
00:26:10.161 --> 00:26:13.010
party. And by the way, look at the labor party in the UK right now,

451
00:26:13.011 --> 00:26:16.370
it was completely destroyed by the radical leftist, right?

452
00:26:16.371 --> 00:26:19.640
The Jeremy Corbyn left was crushed in the elections.

453
00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:23.810
And my hope is that that is what will happen, uh, with the Democrats this time,

454
00:26:23.811 --> 00:26:28.730
because then maybe they can recalibrate and some old school Democrats and

455
00:26:28.731 --> 00:26:30.020
blue dog Democrats, some,

456
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:33.800
some decent open-minded free speech Democrats could come back.

457
00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:36.710
And then guess what, as, as Jordan Peterson always says,

458
00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.460
you would then have a healthy tension between the left and the right,

459
00:26:40.461 --> 00:26:43.260
a healthy tension between Democrats and conservatives,

460
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:47.310
that healthy tension between conservatives and liberals. All right. People,

461
00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:51.810
the interview, uh, that I did with, uh, the young man and the lady,

462
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.780
uh, from Southwest flight that we just showed you,

463
00:26:54.781 --> 00:26:58.200
the video that'll be up in about an hour. This has been the Rubin report,

464
00:26:58.201 --> 00:27:01.980
direct message. Have a nice day, everybody. And, uh, take a walk.

465
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:05.940
How about taking a walk, get out there and get a little sunshine. All right.

466
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:06.710
See you guys.

467
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.710
<v 0>Wow.</v>
