1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.070
<v 0>It's the left and you talking about true evil.</v>

2
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:06.540
When you work diligently to keep people hopeless and educated.

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:07.710
That's what I call evil.

4
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.580
You go to the state of California with 75% of the Blackboard state of

5
00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:15.210
California. 2017 can not pass standard reading and writing tests.

6
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.340
When young people cannot read and write,

7
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.840
we're not going to talk about space court.

8
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.580
We're not going to have conversations like this.

9
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.970
You're going to turn on the networks and be driven by emotion because they have

10
00:00:23.971 --> 00:00:26.490
no hope, no way of thinking. No matter reasoning.

11
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.570
<v 2>What kind of traction are you getting? Cause you know,</v>

12
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.470
it's funny the way Twitter operates, you know,

13
00:00:39.471 --> 00:00:41.600
I see certain personalities that are,

14
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.870
will bubble up for awhile and then I'll click a profile. I'll go, Oh,

15
00:00:44.871 --> 00:00:47.840
this guy is running for Congress in Utah.

16
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.680
This girl's running for something in Florida, something else. And you're,

17
00:00:50.681 --> 00:00:51.441
you're kind of like, Oh,

18
00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:54.710
well they they're sort of popular on Twitter or they make sense here,

19
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.500
but it's a little hard to tell from as an outsider. Well,

20
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.210
is this gaining traction at home?

21
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.140
How can you grade sort of where your campaign is at? Uh, are,

22
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.260
are there weak spots that you want to shore up? You know, that kind of thing.

23
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.643
<v 0>Very different.</v>

24
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.200
I think the blessings that I've had is that I never thought about being a

25
00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:13.880
politician all these years. I mean,

26
00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:16.460
literally it did not happen until by this time last year.

27
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.500
So up until this point, I came out of the book. Uh, the person was, uh,

28
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.110
liberalism, how to turn good men into whiners, weenies, and wimps.

29
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.010
And that got me on just run the same time that the company gets a good title.

30
00:01:28.011 --> 00:01:29.150
It really is, but it's,

31
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.210
it's just about the same time the company was doing his kneeling,

32
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.060
but had a chance to get on and share with America,

33
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.690
my thoughts and my pride in country and that what I saw as really being

34
00:01:38.691 --> 00:01:42.320
detrimental. So I had a chance to develop some friendships throughout the time.

35
00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:44.120
And so now that I, that I'm running,

36
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.370
I really have an opportunity to have exposure.

37
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.440
That's been very advantageous for me. Uh,

38
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.450
we have a community again because we're,

39
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.410
we're very conservative that looks at Fox. So many people knew me somewhat,

40
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.230
even though I was in a very small niche, I was working with at-risk kids.

41
00:01:57.231 --> 00:02:01.030
So it wasn't out in community a whole lot, but it's been an opportunity for me.

42
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.720
First of all, to really know, uh, this, this,

43
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.400
this district a lot more than I would've ever no outstate lot better.

44
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.960
Cause I'm not out talking with people.

45
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.900
And what I'm finding is that my message resonates.

46
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.830
We all just want to have somebody who willing to stand and not,

47
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.850
not wilt and not, not feel ashamed and not apologize.

48
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.690
And I'll tell you to be in the end of the day when God country,

49
00:02:23.691 --> 00:02:28.070
family and raised is the most important thing before anything else it's easy to

50
00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:32.240
stand. It really is no big deal because if that's being attacked,

51
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.240
then you want to run to make sure you protect all the above.

52
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.490
And that's what I'm finding out across our country.

53
00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:40.580
We have conservatives that really get it. They don't mind taking the hit.

54
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.010
They don't mind being called names. Cause it doesn't mean a thing.

55
00:02:43.011 --> 00:02:45.740
Matter of fact, I tell people, call me names, make sure you're using your time.

56
00:02:45.741 --> 00:02:46.910
Right? Cause it doesn't impact me.

57
00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:50.180
You might be wasting a lot of time because it doesn't bother me at all. So,

58
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.220
so together we get that group together and we get this message to those

59
00:02:55.221 --> 00:02:59.060
again, who has been truly used over the last few months,

60
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.760
the abuse the last few months,

61
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.090
I think we have a point that we can start to resonate and say, yes, you know,

62
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:04.690
guys,

63
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.780
this worked together to get our County back to where it was a few months ago and

64
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:10.720
this time know who the enemy is and never go back.

65
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.570
And I think that's where we come out of this, this process with.

66
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.840
<v 2>Yeah. So I, as I said,</v>

67
00:03:15.841 --> 00:03:18.360
I was on your website this morning and I was looking at the issues that you

68
00:03:18.361 --> 00:03:22.320
knock out one, one at a time, uh, let's just do two or three that you're,

69
00:03:22.321 --> 00:03:26.520
that you're particularly passionate about. Um, you, you leave,

70
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.780
I'll even toss them up to you.

71
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.870
Give me two or two or three that you really care about that you think are the

72
00:03:30.871 --> 00:03:32.730
core issues that that can help you in.

73
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.130
<v 0>Very good, very good day. Uh, again,</v>

74
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.480
everything that I'm working with is based on those promises, life, Liberty,

75
00:03:39.481 --> 00:03:40.380
and pursuit of happiness.

76
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.730
That's the bottom line for us to understand that we have to be educated,

77
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.350
ignorant and free can never be Thomas Jefferson. That is so powerful.

78
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.690
And the left is understood that a long time.

79
00:03:51.691 --> 00:03:55.230
That's why they work very hard to make sure we stay ignorant. It's the left.

80
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.310
And you talk about true evil.

81
00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.780
When you work diligently to keep people hopeless and educated.

82
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.950
That's what I call evil.

83
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.270
You go to the state of California with 75% of the Blackboard state of California

84
00:04:06.271 --> 00:04:09.450
in 2017 can not pass standard reading and writing tests.

85
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.580
When young people cannot read and write,

86
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.080
we're not going to talk about space Corps.

87
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.820
We're not going to have conversations like this.

88
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.210
You're going to turn on the network and be driven by emotion because they have

89
00:04:18.211 --> 00:04:20.760
no hope, no way of thinking. No matter reasoning,

90
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.020
they'll never read the scriptures.

91
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.170
The connection with a God in heaven will never ever happen.

92
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.080
And you go to every single threshold.

93
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.980
Every single city that's owned by the leftist, by the Democrats.

94
00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:36.360
You've seen the exact same thing, hopelessness, anger, and literacy.

95
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.240
So education is going to be a bit big. It's going to be a big piece.

96
00:04:39.241 --> 00:04:42.810
Now the other part of education is that what they've done in higher education.

97
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.230
It's just not just the poor kids that are being attacked.

98
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.210
It's the rest of our kids.

99
00:04:48.211 --> 00:04:51.780
That's how middle-class we raise our kids in a great environment.

100
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.310
We send them off to get a degree.

101
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.400
They come back as little marks as Hayden off country and not being able to think

102
00:04:56.401 --> 00:04:57.720
at all about reasoning.

103
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.690
They have been doing this for so long and now you see it in the streets,

104
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.370
across the country and T4. They're not black kids. They're they're,

105
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.160
they're middle-class yuppie my days yuppies. What was cool?

106
00:05:08.161 --> 00:05:11.880
I don't know if it's still cooler, but, but they're, they're,

107
00:05:11.881 --> 00:05:14.730
they're they're kids who have the wealth, but they hate our country.

108
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.550
What I think we should do is very simply this I talked about earlier,

109
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.020
this put together a program and an understanding of what is expected about

110
00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:25.050
colleges. They want, they want, they want our money. They, first of all,

111
00:05:25.051 --> 00:05:27.540
we have to see transparency. How much is being been?

112
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.230
How much are they succeeding and what areas we need as a country,

113
00:05:31.231 --> 00:05:34.620
if they don't hit those areas, those, those bills do matrix. We get our money,

114
00:05:34.621 --> 00:05:37.590
we take it back, put it someplace else. So education is the first thing.

115
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.980
One of the things that just warmed my heart really warmed my heart.

116
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.170
When I saw the rise in Minneapolis, it had this video of these black owners,

117
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.090
black businesses just next to each other. Yeah. And in the window, black owned,

118
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.620
big black deck back on.

119
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.940
And this was an it opportunity for all of us to see what a Passover looks

120
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.960
because the, the, the locus and the,

121
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.950
the pillage of losers passed over these businesses. Why?

122
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.530
Because there was these eight or 15 sitting there on the store to these Gates,

123
00:06:07.531 --> 00:06:09.920
these kids, knowing that it didn't show up here,

124
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.110
you're going to have some issues,

125
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.430
some issues they pass by to go to those companies.

126
00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:16.010
Those businesses that still believes in the bureaucracy is going to take,

127
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.810
going to save them. So those,

128
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.370
I think those are the two top things is education educational allow us to have

129
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.490
that mindset to go out and build our own businesses, build our property,

130
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:26.360
which is important.

131
00:06:26.361 --> 00:06:30.380
That's what the pursuit of happiness was in place for pursuit of property.

132
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.190
When that property will be tangible property, intellectual property,

133
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.520
spiritual property passed down through our kids, our name, those things.

134
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.060
We work our lives to build at the end of the day, without our last breath,

135
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.420
which was able to say, I'm so glad I live because this is my legacy.

136
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.240
That's what a property was truly means in order to protect that,

137
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:48.710
we need to be educated,

138
00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:51.320
to think about what it looks like and to have the vision, to get there.

139
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.220
We also have to have the tools to protect every single step of the way so nobody

140
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.530
can come in and steal it from us. And we now understand,

141
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.000
we've talked about needing to have that, that ability go to these cities,

142
00:07:02.001 --> 00:07:05.030
where they would just let loose evils, just let loose. In these cities.

143
00:07:05.031 --> 00:07:07.220
We started to see what it really looks like and where we can.

144
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.050
We can never let that happen in our lifetime.

145
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:14.590
<v 2>Do you think that that mindset of, of how to conquer all of this,</v>

146
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.840
um, is really the same mindset,

147
00:07:16.841 --> 00:07:21.010
whether you're an entrepreneur or a professional athlete or a politician that

148
00:07:21.011 --> 00:07:25.210
really wants to change things properly, that it is purely a mindset of,

149
00:07:25.211 --> 00:07:29.410
I am going to dedicate myself to this relentlessly and see it fit.

150
00:07:29.411 --> 00:07:31.960
And maybe that's why you can see it as a,

151
00:07:31.961 --> 00:07:36.310
as a former NFL player where some people can't quite see it because, you know,

152
00:07:36.311 --> 00:07:41.260
there's this idea that somehow victimhood gives you virtue these days,

153
00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:43.290
or can't someone else do it, or, or the cyst,

154
00:07:43.291 --> 00:07:46.540
the rules are so against me that I can't do it. But it's like,

155
00:07:46.541 --> 00:07:51.070
if we think of all of our heroes, our sports heroes or fictional heroes,

156
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.290
they did it. They said it doesn't matter how messed up the game is. Um,

157
00:07:55.291 --> 00:07:56.800
I'm going, gonna win. I'm going to fix it.

158
00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.460
<v 0>And you know, that's, that's what comes out of a healthy environment. Uh,</v>

159
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.280
that's what came out of my community growing up. Um, did your parents,

160
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.790
when we had the idea, first of all, life is not always called fair.

161
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.700
Life is difficult. And there are people who are going to try to slow you down.

162
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.110
But if you have the tenacity,

163
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.470
you can dream because you've educated yourself to know this possible.

164
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.590
And you have the faith know that, that you're just especially anybody else.

165
00:08:17.591 --> 00:08:21.190
Then we can overcome those obstacles, the problem with having in my community.

166
00:08:21.191 --> 00:08:24.610
And we're now having across the country. And I say this as often as I can,

167
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.180
what destroyed my community was turned it upside down.

168
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.390
So we see kids now that are acting like victims and it's destroying their own

169
00:08:31.391 --> 00:08:34.090
properties. It was not white supremacists.

170
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:37.030
It's never has been white supremacists. We beat out white supremacists.

171
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.320
It's been black liters. It's been those with stealth. Those who look like me,

172
00:08:41.321 --> 00:08:43.930
those who talk like me, those who put their arms around and say, you know,

173
00:08:43.931 --> 00:08:45.610
we're going to bake things right. And make things.

174
00:08:45.611 --> 00:08:49.300
So it's all fair and it's still out. They go and they go to Congress,

175
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.780
the black caucus, the NAACP, uh, your name, um,

176
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.250
the elitist instead of giving us and tell us what we can do.

177
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.710
They purposely put in place impediments.

178
00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:01.530
They put in laws that make sure the poor connect become,

179
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.030
become melt middle class,

180
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.680
to make sure that our poor black kids could never be educated. Why?

181
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:12.780
Because they're stuck because of this anti-choice that these black leaders will

182
00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:17.760
vote for and stand for and see their people destroyed because they

183
00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:21.210
don't care. So it is truly elite as across the board. That's our enemy.

184
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:25.110
And I'll say this, if we go ahead and educate ourselves,

185
00:09:25.111 --> 00:09:29.220
not to what the propaganda of the leftist educate ourselves to our history,

186
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.280
educate ourselves to what we, the people have done. I'll tell you, Dave,

187
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.910
if we did that, I'm just real quick story. I would never, ever,

188
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.340
ever, I'm not a racist. I've never will be, but my point is,

189
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.040
but particularly for, uh, uh, um,

190
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.870
our German and Mexican Americans will ever look down or feel bad about that

191
00:09:48.871 --> 00:09:51.750
race, those people. Why? Because my, when my great,

192
00:09:51.751 --> 00:09:54.360
great grandfather came here and had been the Belle of the ship, a slave ship,

193
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:59.100
they escaped, uh, North, South Carolina, uh, plantation that bridges plantation.

194
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.180
They went to Southern and Western route of the underground railroad guess who

195
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:05.610
was, who was making that happen? Christian,

196
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.400
German Americans and Mexican Americans, and opened the doors,

197
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.160
opening the fields, fed them, gave them hope along the way.

198
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.910
And what happened when that trip out West, not only did my, my great,

199
00:10:14.911 --> 00:10:17.880
great grandfather understand he could make great things happen,

200
00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:22.140
but he was able to forgive and went on to be a successful entrepreneur. Uh,

201
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.680
I owned a hundred, two acres of land that he bought in two, eight, two years,

202
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.520
a pillar of his community, because along the way, this traveler,

203
00:10:29.521 --> 00:10:31.080
he realized that all white people on bad.
