00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.680
<v 0>I am not surprised to see the end of Trump's at least first four years ending</v>

2
00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:07.770
chaotically since that is how they began. And that is how they went.

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.160
And that is why he was elected in the first place to be a disruptor.

4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.130
So why are people so shocked that he continues to disrupt?

5
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.220
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

6
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.540
<v 2>All right. This is the Rubin report.</v>

7
00:00:23.541 --> 00:00:27.830
I'm Dave Rubin and we are doing a quick on the fly interview today because I

8
00:00:27.831 --> 00:00:30.980
mentioned on the show the other day, I don't know who to trust anymore.

9
00:00:30.981 --> 00:00:32.990
I don't know. Who's making sense. I don't know.

10
00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:37.220
Who's looking at the world with clear eyes and I went through my mental Rolodex

11
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.160
and Megan Kelly popped up and Megan,

12
00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:45.140
you agreed to do the show just like that. And here we are. How are you doing?

13
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.120
<v 0>I'm doing well for you, Dave. Anytime. Clear eyes, full heart. Can't lose.</v>

14
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.020
<v 2>All right. Well, here are my notes for today's interview.</v>

15
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.710
<v 0>Oh, are you just like Tony Barrett?</v>

16
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.200
<v 2>I got nothing. Although my guys did tell me, this is,</v>

17
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.020
this is going to air on Sunday. We're taping this Friday afternoon.

18
00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:05.690
So people will have to bear with, you know,

19
00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:09.980
if any little crazy boat got changed or anything else. But generally speaking,

20
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.550
as we tape this on Friday afternoon,

21
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.280
how are you feeling about the state of this election? The media portion of it,

22
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.330
the recount portion of it, Biden Trump, the whole thing.

23
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.800
<v 0>I have a lot of thoughts. Um, a lot of thoughts let's do. Um,</v>

24
00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:29.000
let's do one at a time.

25
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.890
I am not surprised to see the end of Trump's at least first four years ending

26
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.010
chaotically since that is how they began. And that is how they went.

27
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.370
And that is why he was elected in the first place to be a disruptor.

28
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.000
So why are people so shocked that he continues to disrupt, uh,

29
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.030
right up to the last, what appear to be the last final moments of, you know,

30
00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:49.760
his, his, if not his presidency, his, you know,

31
00:01:49.761 --> 00:01:54.320
the time in his presidency before election? Um, I think Trump has lost.

32
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.900
I do. I know people don't want to hear that. Um,

33
00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.340
but I think he's lost and I think a lot of people are struggling to

34
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.120
accept it, right? It's like, uh, a grief process. The first,

35
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.080
first step is denial. And I think Trump,

36
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.260
and I'm not saying that he shouldn't get, we should do all the stuff we should.

37
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.910
We should check out what's happening in Pennsylvania.

38
00:02:13.911 --> 00:02:15.470
He should see those legal challenges through.

39
00:02:15.471 --> 00:02:17.570
We should make sure we have a Wisconsin, Wisconsin, recount,

40
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.340
and a Georgia recount. Uh,

41
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.080
but my assessment from where I sit out here is there are not enough

42
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.040
gettable boats,

43
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.910
even if he can prove fraud or some untoward process with the mailing boats to

44
00:02:28.911 --> 00:02:32.630
get them over the top anymore, that that phase has passed. Um.

45
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.430
<v 2>I have faith that the numbers that we're getting are real, like,</v>

46
00:02:37.431 --> 00:02:39.620
do you have faith that not only the people on the ground,

47
00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:43.230
in whatever state you want to pick, whatever city you want to sit, uh, pick are,

48
00:02:43.231 --> 00:02:46.430
are being honest. And that is being translated to us, honestly,

49
00:02:46.431 --> 00:02:48.170
through the media. Do you have faith in that?

50
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.410
<v 0>Not utter faith, but enough faith. I mean,</v>

51
00:02:51.411 --> 00:02:56.390
these are the same people who did the count four years ago and he won. So let's,

52
00:02:56.391 --> 00:03:00.460
let's be real. They didn't just become, uh, you know,

53
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.020
vote counters in the past four years.

54
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.940
And they also hated him four years ago. It's not like they loved him.

55
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:08.620
They thought he was going to be full of love and rainbows.

56
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:12.490
When he got into office, they wanted to kill him four years ago. And you know,

57
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:14.980
Philadelphia is famous for its voter fraud. And so like these,

58
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.520
these problems have existed long before now.

59
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.340
And what I'm seeing in the electoral process is it, to me,

60
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:24.640
it's akin to like when we went HD and television,

61
00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:28.120
where everything looked just fine when it was like, there's a little fuzzy.

62
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:30.490
And then like, when you could see it up close and personal, it was like,

63
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:33.940
my eyes were like, God, I didn't want to see this, this hideous.

64
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.780
And that's what's happening with our electoral process. It isn't perfect.

65
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:41.260
It's far from perfect. It's the best we have. Should we do better?

66
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.640
Can we do better? Yes. And yes. Hello Florida. Let's just be like Florida. Um,

67
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.530
but we're not right now and we're not going to get it to the point of, ah,

68
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.060
now it's perfect.

69
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.750
And we can perfectly know that every vote that was proper was counted and

70
00:03:55.751 --> 00:03:58.900
everyone that wasn't was not, it's not going to happen. People.

71
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.670
That's not the way our system is built.

72
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.020
So we're going to have to do good enough. That's how the system set up. And the,

73
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.760
even the votes he's counting,

74
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.550
even the ones he's like that was fraudulently filled out. Or that's Bubba,

75
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.940
you're talking about handfuls handfuls here and there. You know,

76
00:04:12.941 --> 00:04:15.790
you're not talking down about 70,000 votes.

77
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.050
That's going to get him over the top in Arizona. That's not going to happen.

78
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.040
And you know, the places where it's tightest Biden is a ahead.

79
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.790
Biden is a head right now in Georgia. Biden is ahead. Um,

80
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.670
in a couple of these States that Trump is contesting.

81
00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:35.620
So I just think the odds of Trump turning this around right now

82
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.880
are infant testimony. And so re I'm not saying it's totally impossible,

83
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.700
but realistically, if you want to know what I think,

84
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.480
I think he's lost and I don't think his legal challenges or the recounts are

85
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:47.463
going to amount to much.

86
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.800
<v 2>Yeah. So, so what do you think he'll do,</v>

87
00:04:49.801 --> 00:04:53.160
do you think he just runs the table with every legal recap, every,

88
00:04:53.161 --> 00:04:56.400
every legal course of action and just does absolutely anything,

89
00:04:56.401 --> 00:04:59.610
or do you sense that maybe at some point, if what you're saying is right,

90
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.290
that he will throw in the towel.

91
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.770
<v 0>I know that throwing in the towel doesn't sound like Trump. And, uh,</v>

92
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.770
I also think he owes it to his supporters who love him and,

93
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.450
and don't trust these systems for good reasons to see these challenges through.

94
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.180
I have no problem with him stoking those fires and getting in there and making

95
00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:17.100
sure to the extent he can,

96
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.960
maybe it's his final act as president right before his lame duck period to like

97
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.510
disrupt yet another system to upend it,

98
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.230
blow it up and ultimately make it better, right. Tear down.

99
00:05:28.231 --> 00:05:32.460
So we can come back better for the next four year period. Um, but I,

100
00:05:32.461 --> 00:05:36.480
I support his, his willingness to challenge these, you know,

101
00:05:36.481 --> 00:05:39.000
where he has good faith evidence of a problem,

102
00:05:39.001 --> 00:05:42.630
like what happened in Pennsylvania with allowing the Malin votes to be

103
00:05:42.631 --> 00:05:44.010
postmarked on election day,

104
00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:48.720
something that was approved by judges and not legislators, which is not okay.

105
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.090
The court refused to take that challenge. They said,

106
00:05:51.091 --> 00:05:53.760
get back to us if this becomes an ongoing problem after the election.

107
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.280
And if there's a split in the States that we might have to resolve,

108
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.630
he should proceed pursue that. You should. But again,

109
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.290
it doesn't look like there are enough boats in that pile that could help him

110
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.330
anyway. I think he should see it through,

111
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.870
I don't think he should give up before he has to, but I think realistically,

112
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.970
when it becomes clear that he's lost,

113
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.420
we're going to need the people who are closest to him, who he trusts,

114
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.830
not the media, which he doesn't for good reason to sit him down and say,

115
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.580
it's no longer about you. This is about the country.

116
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.940
And there will be a peaceful transfer of power.

117
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.860
And while you can go out there and say,

118
00:06:27.861 --> 00:06:30.890
I have real problems with the way the system conducted itself.

119
00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:32.240
And I don't know about this vote.

120
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.340
I am going to pass the torch and put America first to quote

121
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:38.750
somebody. We all know.

122
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.350
<v 2>Do you think that part of his calculation of, of even if he sees it,</v>

123
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.810
that he's lost, like the challenges aren't going anywhere?

124
00:06:46.811 --> 00:06:50.650
That part of it will be the burn it down thing, because you know,

125
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.950
even just a few minutes before we started here, I saw a tweet by AOC and,

126
00:06:53.951 --> 00:06:57.280
you know, in, uh, in effect, you know, we're going to have to come for Trump.

127
00:06:57.281 --> 00:07:00.880
And he, you know, they keep saying enablers and the sycophants and whatever.

128
00:07:00.881 --> 00:07:03.360
And it's like, you know, a few weeks ago, Robert Rice,

129
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.820
who was in the Clinton administration talking about a truth and reconciliation

130
00:07:06.821 --> 00:07:11.320
commission and that these people love lists and all of these weird things.

131
00:07:11.321 --> 00:07:14.830
And it's like, for all the chance of lock her up, it never happened.

132
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:15.521
There was no,

133
00:07:15.521 --> 00:07:18.610
there was nobody knocking on Hillary's door and that Trump may feel.

134
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.940
And I think actually for good reason that, that these people,

135
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.130
whether the guy did anything illegal or not,

136
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.430
they've created this monster in their heads, let's say,

137
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.780
and that they will do things that are unimaginable in,

138
00:07:30.781 --> 00:07:32.410
in the American political landscape.

139
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.410
<v 0>Well, I think, yes, they will.</v>

140
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.290
It's not paranoia when they really are out to get you.

141
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.170
And that explains a lot of Trump's behavior. I mean,

142
00:07:41.171 --> 00:07:45.550
I think the media is like so disgusted by his rhetoric from the white house.

143
00:07:45.551 --> 00:07:47.650
And they're like, it's not great. I'm not going to defend it,

144
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.630
but I understand where he's coming from.

145
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.560
They have been out to get him for more than four years.

146
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:58.750
The media is his enemy. They absolutely are his enemy.

147
00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:03.790
And the Democrats load him in a special

148
00:08:03.791 --> 00:08:04.624
way.

149
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:09.130
And one does have to wonder if a lot of these Democrats think the ends justify

150
00:08:09.131 --> 00:08:10.490
the means. I mean, we,

151
00:08:10.491 --> 00:08:14.470
we really have had a baseless attempt to impeach the guy

152
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.750
that was right on the heels of a completely made up Russia

153
00:08:19.751 --> 00:08:24.610
investigation and not to mention all the non controversies the media fed

154
00:08:24.611 --> 00:08:29.170
off of for the last four years. So he is right to totally distrust them.

155
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.470
The pollsters have had it totally wrong when it comes to Trump all along.

156
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:36.460
I do want to make a distinction between the pollsters who predict vote prior to

157
00:08:36.461 --> 00:08:40.960
the vote and the people at the decision desks who analyze for a living

158
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:44.950
raw vote tallies, two totally different animals. Okay.

159
00:08:44.951 --> 00:08:48.400
So just because we don't trust the pollsters like Nate silver doesn't mean we

160
00:08:48.401 --> 00:08:51.220
shouldn't trust the Fox news decision desk, but anyway,

161
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:55.300
Trump has a general distrust of the systems that's well-founded.

162
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.630
And so, and I, and so to his fans,

163
00:08:57.631 --> 00:09:00.090
and that's why I think people aren't being nuts right now.

164
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:02.250
It's not crazy conspiratorial people like no one,

165
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:06.870
but it's based on data it's based on experience. And, uh,

166
00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:11.400
and to expect the left, to understand any of that is too much to expect.

167
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:14.580
They won't there isn't grace on the other side. I mean, there's,

168
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.580
there's great guys like Andrew Yang, right? Who's saying all the right things,

169
00:09:17.581 --> 00:09:20.460
like be cool. And like, let's not go too far and whatever.

170
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:24.210
And then there's just jerks like AOC or Nancy Pelosi coming out and saying,

171
00:09:24.211 --> 00:09:27.040
we have a mandate, which you don't even have close to a mandate. And,

172
00:09:27.041 --> 00:09:29.490
and one other point on her, the more you say, you have a mandate,

173
00:09:29.491 --> 00:09:32.550
which you clearly do not lost how seats instead of gaining them,

174
00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:34.230
it looks like you're not going to have control of the Senate.

175
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.650
You didn't get the blue wave at the federal at the presidential level.

176
00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.570
The more the Republicans,

177
00:09:39.571 --> 00:09:43.560
if they do take over that Senate are going to do to stymie every piece of Joe

178
00:09:43.561 --> 00:09:47.400
Biden's agenda. There will be no grace on their side either. So.

179
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:50.570
<v 2>I actually read your tweet about Nancy Pelosi and the mandate on,</v>

180
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.890
on my show this morning.

181
00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:55.550
And I was trying to frame it in a way that that will give people,

182
00:09:55.551 --> 00:09:58.850
obviously a lot of my audience likes Trump. So I was trying to say, okay,

183
00:09:58.851 --> 00:10:02.270
if this doesn't work, if this doesn't end up the way you want it to end up,

184
00:10:02.271 --> 00:10:04.790
like, what are the silver linings around this thing?

185
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:09.020
And I agree with you that her tweet or her comment was so over the top that

186
00:10:09.021 --> 00:10:12.410
maybe it gets the Republicans to dig. And then I'm starting to think, you know,

187
00:10:12.411 --> 00:10:15.380
I'm not a status generally in like a traditional sense,

188
00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:19.610
but I'm starting to think that maybe instead of the small government that I

189
00:10:19.611 --> 00:10:22.430
really want, maybe we never really get to that.

190
00:10:22.431 --> 00:10:26.540
But maybe the best thing we could have is sort of like an endlessly stalemated

191
00:10:26.541 --> 00:10:30.590
government like that, that basically just can't do anything.

192
00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:34.520
And then what'll happen is every four years we'll have the guy do executive

193
00:10:34.521 --> 00:10:36.430
actions and then the next guy will reverse them. And that,

194
00:10:36.431 --> 00:10:39.560
and that'll just be the way we're governed. And I know it kind of sucks.

195
00:10:39.561 --> 00:10:41.480
And for those of us that do this for a living,

196
00:10:41.481 --> 00:10:45.110
it's like not really what you want, but like maybe in a bizarre sense,

197
00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:47.590
that's the last fail safe that we have. Does that make.

198
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.230
<v 0>Basis status could be, could be okay. Right.</v>

199
00:10:51.231 --> 00:10:55.370
I think that the Democrats would much have preferred status to Trump doing

200
00:10:55.371 --> 00:10:58.490
anything meaningful. And I think that's how the Republicans are feeling now.

201
00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.180
I mean, I,

202
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:03.200
my own sense of it is most Republicans aren't that scared of Joe Biden, the man,

203
00:11:03.201 --> 00:11:06.260
because he has a 50 year history of legislating from the middle,

204
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:11.450
but Joe Biden is elderly and not totally with it mentally from what we've

205
00:11:11.451 --> 00:11:12.200
seen.

206
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.410
And I think a lot of people are worried that he is just going to be the puppet

207
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:18.800
and people like AOC and Nancy Pelosi are going to be the puppeteers.

208
00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.750
And I realized those two women don't have the same agenda,

209
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.290
but as far as Republicans are concerned, neither is good. Um, you know,

210
00:11:24.291 --> 00:11:26.930
you're not going to have some moderate, um, you know,

211
00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.920
Joe mansion pulling the strings on Joe Biden. It's going to be people like that,

212
00:11:30.921 --> 00:11:31.521
the squad,

213
00:11:31.521 --> 00:11:34.040
and nobody wants a squad getting in there and telling them what to do,

214
00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:37.160
or just pressuring him so much that he does it. So I think Stacy,

215
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.740
this would be okay, but I think it could be worse than stasis.

216
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.310
It could be a bloody civil war sort of if you will political.

217
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:47.120
So I forgive that reference because, um, if they,

218
00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.250
if they do go after Trump, if they, if,

219
00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.250
if they decide to go after him legally and put them in jail and I'll do

220
00:11:52.251 --> 00:11:55.450
everything and like, you know, completely go after Trump and his supporters,

221
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.480
you know, the Senate does a lot. If it Republicans control the Senate.

222
00:11:58.481 --> 00:12:00.970
And I don't, I know we're looking at two runoffs in Georgia,

223
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.820
but Georgia Republicans have never lost a runoff in the state of Georgia.

224
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:07.030
Never not realize we're going to have a huge money dump there to try to change

225
00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:09.250
that this time around. But, and George is changing.

226
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.670
It's becoming bluer obviously, but the odds are on the GOP side.

227
00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:17.620
So let's assume for now GOP retains control of the Senate. They,

228
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.320
if they retain control of the Senate and the Democrats do all those things,

229
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:25.000
they're going to make it as ugly and as acrimonious and is unfortunate for the

230
00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:28.360
Dems as possible. A lot of these categories just have to be,

231
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.770
they have to be confirmed by the Senate, right? Like what if, what if, uh, uh,

232
00:12:32.771 --> 00:12:36.850
justice, uh, God forbid dies and you need confirmation by the set.

233
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.380
Like there there's a lot the Senate can do to stop a president from getting

234
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.330
anything done. And,

235
00:12:42.331 --> 00:12:47.110
and then two years we have another election and the Democrats share of the house

236
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.330
majority. I mean, it's going down like this. As we speak,

237
00:12:49.331 --> 00:12:52.360
it's getting smaller and smaller and it could get down. And all of a sudden,

238
00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:56.920
Dunn's just a four seat advantage by the Dems. If that happens,

239
00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.380
they're almost certainly going to lose control in two years.

240
00:12:59.381 --> 00:13:01.630
So politics never stops.

241
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:06.280
If you are just a complete prick two and four years later,

242
00:13:06.281 --> 00:13:08.110
it's going to come back at you. Right?

243
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.950
<v 2>And then when you look at some of the interesting numbers that broke in</v>

244
00:13:10.951 --> 00:13:15.840
different ways that the black men voted more than two times as high

245
00:13:15.841 --> 00:13:18.810
for a Republican, as they did last time and black women,

246
00:13:18.811 --> 00:13:22.290
it went up from 4% to 8%. That's not a huge percentage,

247
00:13:22.291 --> 00:13:26.730
but doubling is pretty good. I saw something this morning that 16%,

248
00:13:26.731 --> 00:13:28.650
I think of Muslims voted for Trump.

249
00:13:28.651 --> 00:13:31.740
Like all things that you just wouldn't expect that, that, uh,

250
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:35.430
LGBT support for Trump actually more than doubled. So like,

251
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.110
there are some interesting signs of future.

252
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.380
How worried are you just about general,

253
00:13:40.381 --> 00:13:43.080
like trust in the whole thing like that,

254
00:13:43.081 --> 00:13:47.880
the same people who said Russia are now saying our election is tamper-proof

255
00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.850
right. Like, that's the big one that I'm like seeing the hypocrisy on right now,

256
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.060
you guys ran around saying Russia interfered in our elections four years ago.

257
00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.700
Now, now you're telling us because you got what you wanted,

258
00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:01.500
apparently that the system is perfect so that people won't trust the electoral

259
00:14:01.501 --> 00:14:05.580
system. They already don't trust the media system. That, that basically,

260
00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.510
you know, all of our, the colleges, just the institutional level,

261
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:13.140
there is just no trust in anything anymore.

262
00:14:13.141 --> 00:14:16.350
And I can't really fake it for people. You know,

263
00:14:16.351 --> 00:14:19.020
like I wish these things were better, but I don't think they are.

264
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:24.030
<v 0>Well, some of that concerns me, but most of it doesn't, um,</v>

265
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:25.290
I think for example, I think Joe,

266
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.140
Biden's not going to pack the Supreme court and that's good because that would

267
00:14:28.141 --> 00:14:30.600
have been a massive move that would have ruined the Supreme court.

268
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:33.260
And that would have been the end of the Supreme court. And that would,

269
00:14:33.261 --> 00:14:35.580
would have been a catastrophic breakdown of systems.

270
00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:38.780
<v 2>What if it ain't Joe? Cause I'm with you on that? I think Joe.</v>

271
00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:39.190
<v 0>No,</v>

272
00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:42.480
there's not support for it within the democratic party or writ large there isn't.

273
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:43.021
<v 2>Do you think,</v>

274
00:14:43.021 --> 00:14:46.230
you think by him getting in it's it's fed them enough that they won't have to do

275
00:14:46.231 --> 00:14:47.070
like the crazy.

276
00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:48.061
<v 0>Thank you. You know,</v>

277
00:14:48.061 --> 00:14:50.940
if Kamala Harris were at the top of the ticket right now and descending to the

278
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.590
white house, it wouldn't happen there isn't support for it in the United States.

279
00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:56.960
There are the people don't want it. You know,

280
00:14:56.961 --> 00:14:59.810
the FDR couldn't get it through when he controlled his party,

281
00:14:59.811 --> 00:15:04.340
Democrats controlled the house and the Senate and he was hugely popular. Well,

282
00:15:04.341 --> 00:15:08.780
the support right now is 20% lower for packing the court than it was back then.

283
00:15:08.781 --> 00:15:10.730
It's not going to happen. People don't want it.

284
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.250
These politicians aren't politically suicidal.

285
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.580
So that was a good talking point by Jeffrey Toobin who really should have been

286
00:15:16.581 --> 00:15:20.270
more focused on how to work as zoom than writing provocative articles in the new

287
00:15:20.271 --> 00:15:21.890
Yorker about that's never going to happen.

288
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.950
And I don't think Joe Biden is going to do that.

289
00:15:24.951 --> 00:15:27.560
I think the reason he wouldn't answer that when he was running is because the

290
00:15:27.561 --> 00:15:30.950
answer was no, it was to protect his left flank. Uh, you know,

291
00:15:30.951 --> 00:15:33.980
him from his left flank not to protect himself from the right,

292
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:38.990
but I also kind of think that distrust and in

293
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:44.180
some agencies can be good and it's, it's not all destructive.

294
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:44.990
You know,

295
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:49.720
like I think the media needed to be destroyed and,

296
00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:52.970
and now it will rebuild in some way, shape or form. I mean,

297
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:58.580
I really think I've said this to you before that the journalists they've been on

298
00:15:58.581 --> 00:16:01.670
a kamikaze mission ever since Trump, I didn't start with Trump,

299
00:16:01.671 --> 00:16:04.430
but like he he's the, it was the, that was the real mission.

300
00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.270
They've been on a kamikaze mission to take him down and it wound up being a

301
00:16:08.271 --> 00:16:12.440
thing where they did kill themselves. And in the end,

302
00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.230
they, it does appear. They took him with them.

303
00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.260
It does appear they brought him down because if you don't think the media played

304
00:16:18.261 --> 00:16:20.840
a role in people's perceptions of Trump these past four years,

305
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.510
as controversial as he is legitimately back then,

306
00:16:23.511 --> 00:16:25.880
I don't mean to give him a full pass on all the crazy stuff he's done,

307
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:30.530
but the media did so much of it. So they, they are,

308
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.970
they are a force. I don't want to say for evil, that's too strong,

309
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.660
but they're not to be trusted and they're not what they used to be.

310
00:16:38.661 --> 00:16:40.040
And they're not honest about it.

311
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:43.850
So they needed to be destroyed and we'll see what comes up.

312
00:16:43.851 --> 00:16:45.560
So maybe that's true. And the FBI,

313
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:49.040
they needed to be unmasked as this political organization.

314
00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:53.330
I had complete trust in James Comey, David, I did, I was like,

315
00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.830
Jim, call me, I, you know, the guy wrong.

316
00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:02.990
And I'm grateful for having that, you know, that that mass pulled off. And so

317
00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:08.660
I can't totally dismiss the dismantling of distrust of trust in some of these

318
00:17:08.661 --> 00:17:09.490
organizations.

319
00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:10.720
<v 2>Right? Like that. Well, that's what I'm saying.</v>

320
00:17:10.721 --> 00:17:13.670
I'm I'm down with the distrust stuff. I don't, I don't think they,

321
00:17:13.671 --> 00:17:15.430
they deserve our trust anymore,

322
00:17:15.431 --> 00:17:19.090
but the problem is that it sort of only got halfway. In other words,

323
00:17:19.091 --> 00:17:22.330
if Trump loses, well, then they'd been on mass, but they're about to rebuild.

324
00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:26.680
You can already feel it a little bit. Like they didn't fully get us.

325
00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.540
So here we go. Again, something like that.

326
00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:29.740
<v 0>No, I don't think that's right,</v>

327
00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:33.790
because they never lost trust with the Democrats. They they've had it. I mean,

328
00:17:33.791 --> 00:17:35.740
we're just going to a more fractured media world.

329
00:17:35.741 --> 00:17:38.590
Like the country used to have when we were founded for a hundred years

330
00:17:38.591 --> 00:17:40.240
thereafter where, you know,

331
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.030
the left has its sources and the right has its sources. But one great thing.

332
00:17:43.031 --> 00:17:47.890
Trump did was make very clear that virtually everybody is on that

333
00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:51.810
first day, virtually buddy is actually fighting for Democrats.

334
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.840
There's not a Republican in the country left.

335
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:59.640
I think that thinks CNN is fair and objective news.

336
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.400
We may be some people who really don't pay attention to the news might,

337
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:06.090
might still think that the Republicans haven't been fooled, you know,

338
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:10.240
th th the mask has been pulled off. So that's a good thing. You know,

339
00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:11.310
I don't think they're going to,

340
00:18:11.311 --> 00:18:14.550
I think they're going to be very defensive of Joe Biden. I think quietly,

341
00:18:14.551 --> 00:18:18.270
the Washington post democracy dies in darkness is going to just get pulled off

342
00:18:18.271 --> 00:18:22.740
the moon. It's no longer dark, so we don't need,

343
00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:28.830
but I think all of that's great and it gives the audience, you know, it's like,

344
00:18:28.831 --> 00:18:30.330
let me, let me put it to you this way.

345
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:35.730
If you have a friend who's a real jerk and you didn't, you didn't know it. Um,

346
00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.820
I'm thinking of my one friend's example.

347
00:18:38.821 --> 00:18:42.330
So I'll G I'll give you this friends of ours, interracial couple,

348
00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.530
the husband's black, the wife is white. And after the George Floyd thing,

349
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:51.990
they were very upset because one of their white friends called them up and said,

350
00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:56.970
how are you doing? I hope you're okay. And then they saw, they found out, Oh,

351
00:18:56.971 --> 00:18:57.804
no, you know what?

352
00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:00.210
I can't tell the whole story because it will reveal who it was,

353
00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:04.200
but it was somebody who they thought was a friend and who they had helped out

354
00:19:04.201 --> 00:19:06.360
with there, with respect to their kid, getting into college.

355
00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:07.470
They had done a lot to help him.

356
00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:12.720
And basically the guy got outed as repeatedly saying the N word and really

357
00:19:12.721 --> 00:19:17.640
racist stuff about black people. So they were shocked. They were horrified.

358
00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.400
And I said to them, you know what, this is a good thing,

359
00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:23.340
because that was the reality yesterday.

360
00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.240
And you just didn't know w it's better today to know,

361
00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:31.530
and then act accordingly. It's not, it's hurtful to find out,

362
00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.210
but it's not better to be in the dark.

363
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.420
And that's how I feel about the media and these organizations,

364
00:19:36.421 --> 00:19:37.830
which really are politically driven,

365
00:19:37.831 --> 00:19:40.920
but we didn't know it may hurt to learn it or not,

366
00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.800
but it's better to know and then act accordingly. Yeah.

367
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:45.170
<v 2>Yeah. I'm with you on that. Well,</v>

368
00:19:45.171 --> 00:19:48.740
what do you think about the big tech element then also that, you know,

369
00:19:48.741 --> 00:19:53.060
going forward that at least, even though they did nothing, I mean,

370
00:19:53.061 --> 00:19:55.550
I kept saying this the whole time you guys are having these hearings,

371
00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.880
and it's great to see Ted Cruz who I totally like and respect.

372
00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:00.650
It's great to see him grill Jack,

373
00:20:00.651 --> 00:20:03.050
but you guys are doing it six days before an election.

374
00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.890
And we're pretending that this is in theater. Are you worried that, okay,

375
00:20:06.891 --> 00:20:10.310
Trump was sort of the last thing that was stopping big tech from doing whatever

376
00:20:10.311 --> 00:20:13.550
it might want to do. I, I don't know what exactly what it wants to do,

377
00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:18.650
but now without that threat of we're going to regulate you, whatever it might,

378
00:20:18.651 --> 00:20:22.160
you know, break you up, stuff that I don't particularly want them to do. Uh,

379
00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.770
are you worried that they're just going to go all in and,

380
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:28.040
and silence the real resistance, which will be, you know,

381
00:20:28.041 --> 00:20:28.874
the remaining free thing?

382
00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:33.620
<v 0>Yes, I am worried about that. I don't have the solution to that either. I,</v>

383
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:37.070
I am worried. I think one of the sad things,

384
00:20:37.071 --> 00:20:39.200
but the reality is over the past 20,

385
00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:43.100
25 years is the Republicans have shown themselves to be very good at winning

386
00:20:43.101 --> 00:20:45.980
elections. Maybe not in this particular case for the white house,

387
00:20:45.981 --> 00:20:50.500
but in general, they win elections and very bad at fighting the culture Wars.

388
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:55.750
And it's unfortunate because now the Democrats control the

389
00:20:55.751 --> 00:21:00.700
media Hollywood, um, academia, big tech,

390
00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:05.920
and half the country doesn't feel represented at all in

391
00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:09.730
almost all of the information that comes back to them publicly,

392
00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.070
like sports forgot to mention them.

393
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:16.420
So you turn on the television and watch a sports game or get the news or watch

394
00:21:16.421 --> 00:21:19.930
the Oscars or the VMs, whatever it is.

395
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:24.250
And now you're getting woke is shoved down your neck.

396
00:21:24.251 --> 00:21:26.920
And you're being told you're a racist. If you happen to be a Republican,

397
00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:28.120
you like Trump, or even just,

398
00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:32.620
if you're a Republican these days and you send it a tweet that is

399
00:21:32.621 --> 00:21:37.300
totally legitimate and maybe just opinionated or a news story being

400
00:21:37.301 --> 00:21:41.330
reported by that New York post censored, censored, censored, you,

401
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:45.340
your viewpoints are B you're being told they're bad by everyone that has control

402
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:48.580
of the public microphones. And I do think it leads people to be like,

403
00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:51.580
am I insane? M is everything. I think

404
00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:56.500
it's a problem. Now. I think big tech is part of the problem.

405
00:21:56.501 --> 00:22:00.190
I really wish we would see somebody like Peter teal, you know, who, you know,

406
00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:04.420
he's going to have to actively create a new Twitter and a new Facebook.

407
00:22:04.421 --> 00:22:07.300
And like, there needs to be a real,

408
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:11.680
other digital forum out there that represents the other half of the country.

409
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.830
Cause I just don't think they've got much of a future on the existing platforms.

410
00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:15.420
<v 2>Well,</v>

411
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:20.310
the irony is if Trump loses and then it finally gives him the impetus to be

412
00:22:20.311 --> 00:22:23.130
like, okay, I'm going to another platform or I'm starting my own platform.

413
00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:27.360
That's how the platform will work. Right? Like that ultimately would be it.

414
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:29.430
Now you don't, you don't think that would be enough.

415
00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:32.490
<v 0>No, I think that'll be like, I mean, with all due respect,</v>

416
00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.880
Sean Hannity starting his own network, like, you know,

417
00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:36.863
you know what you're going to get.

418
00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.600
You're not going to get real analysis that now that's cool.

419
00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.970
<v 2>No, no, I don't mean, I don't mean you'll get analysis. I mean,</v>

420
00:22:41.971 --> 00:22:43.800
if Trump is just like, all right, I'm going,

421
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:47.970
I'm going to parlor or I'm going to locals or wherever that it would be like

422
00:22:47.971 --> 00:22:51.270
everyone would go there just because he's still the show in a way.

423
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.600
I don't mean that he's going to create some nonpartisan network.

424
00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:55.843
<v 0>If you can.</v>

425
00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.610
Not like conservative media is well-represented in the digital world.

426
00:22:59.611 --> 00:23:01.470
I get that. But when it comes to these main,

427
00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:05.040
the main platforms out there when I'm in Facebook is it gives a little bit more

428
00:23:05.041 --> 00:23:07.440
play, but they're, they're censoring a lot of stuff too.

429
00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.590
But if you could have a real, and I know there's parlor, I'm on parlor,

430
00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:14.580
but it's just, it's not what Twitter is. And I don't know that it's going to be,

431
00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:17.080
you need a real player with a lot of money to,

432
00:23:17.081 --> 00:23:20.610
to create the platform and back it. And somebody with a spine of steel,

433
00:23:20.611 --> 00:23:24.900
like Rupert Murdoch to say, I don't need to be loved at the cocktail parties.

434
00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:30.300
I'm going to let this be a real forum for mainstream conservative

435
00:23:30.301 --> 00:23:33.660
thought. In other words, we don't need Alex Jones on there. Okay.

436
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.110
But like Dave Rubin does not need to get censored. Right.

437
00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.320
And I that's my only thought because I,

438
00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:44.760
you're not going to change Jack Dorsey. You're not going to change Facebook.

439
00:23:44.761 --> 00:23:48.380
You're not going to change these big tech organizations for whom it's like

440
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:53.150
deeply ideological. They think it's the difference between good and evil.

441
00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:55.100
You know, it's not just about getting Biden, elected.

442
00:23:55.101 --> 00:23:58.580
It's about silencing the rest of these racists.

443
00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:01.910
Did you see that clip from sunny Hostin on the view? Yeah.

444
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:03.703
<v 2>Unbelievable.</v>

445
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:08.510
<v 0>That that embodies how they think that the left wing now I don't even mean</v>

446
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:10.130
progressives. I know you used to be one.

447
00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.250
Most professors I know are totally normal and mainstream and they don't believe

448
00:24:13.251 --> 00:24:14.180
in any of this nonsense.

449
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:18.950
It's the quote left with a capital L who are insane and the way they see the

450
00:24:18.951 --> 00:24:20.660
other half of the country and sunny Hostin,

451
00:24:20.661 --> 00:24:25.490
just put it on display where it was like these at least half the

452
00:24:25.491 --> 00:24:29.240
country. I'm not going to say they're racists, whatever it is,

453
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:34.070
that's either racist. But at least half the country voted for him.

454
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:38.420
Net was standing his racism, his sexism CISM, his xenophobia,

455
00:24:38.421 --> 00:24:43.190
his transphobia. And then, uh, another woman on the panel,

456
00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:45.980
Sarah, I don't remember her name, but she was like, how can you say that?

457
00:24:45.981 --> 00:24:47.000
You know, people vote in their own.

458
00:24:47.001 --> 00:24:49.400
Self-interest all the time pocketbook issues. And so on.

459
00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:51.920
It doesn't make them bad. It doesn't make them racist.

460
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:56.930
And the response was no, because this is about we,

461
00:24:56.931 --> 00:25:01.910
the people and we are supposed to behave as a collective and do what

462
00:25:01.911 --> 00:25:06.650
is right. What are those things today? I was like, Oh my God, I wish so badly.

463
00:25:06.651 --> 00:25:08.630
For the first time in my life that I were sitting on the view.

464
00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:10.820
<v 2>I.</v>

465
00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.550
<v 0>Would have loved to said to her, I, I get it. Totally.</v>

466
00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:15.620
And just out of curiosity, I'm wondering,

467
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:19.370
cause like there's a lot of people who really feel like, for example, um,

468
00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:24.710
abortion is murder and it's actually killing babies and that's wrong.

469
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:28.160
And what would be right would be to ban it outright.

470
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:31.580
And if you don't support that, you are on the wrong side,

471
00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:34.340
you're in favor of murder. And we,

472
00:25:34.341 --> 00:25:38.000
the people respond to you to behave as a collective, right?

473
00:25:38.001 --> 00:25:42.560
Like I could go on for, you know, give me five other examples, like outreach.

474
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:44.720
And by the way, let's look at the Southern border. You know,

475
00:25:44.721 --> 00:25:47.750
the people down there who have had family members killed by people illegally

476
00:25:47.751 --> 00:25:52.550
coming across with drugs and weapons who have lost jobs to people who are here

477
00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:53.720
unlawfully in the country.

478
00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:58.070
They have real reasons for wanting a great border wall and for cracking down on

479
00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:01.520
illegal immigration. And if you don't support it,

480
00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:05.450
you're the one who doesn't care about life and the well-being of your fellow

481
00:26:05.451 --> 00:26:10.100
citizens and read up people who died and made her

482
00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.190
King of we, the people, right. It's like, do you think.

483
00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:18.250
<v 2>Do you think they'll ever stop that thing like that in many ways,</v>

484
00:26:18.251 --> 00:26:21.610
what you just described there, that is the thing that most,

485
00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:26.740
the rest of us are fighting have to make it about Sonny, but that thing,

486
00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:28.930
and it's been so successful. And,

487
00:26:28.931 --> 00:26:32.260
and as we're talking potentially is about to dethrone Donald Trump,

488
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:33.880
why would they stop doing it?

489
00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:37.630
<v 0>They're not going to, they're not going to. And I,</v>

490
00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.990
I agreed with the headlines this week that said woke ism was dealt a blow during

491
00:26:40.991 --> 00:26:42.370
this election because he saw, you know,

492
00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:45.570
his numbers as pointed out with all these minority groups, go up, people,

493
00:26:45.571 --> 00:26:48.080
the minority groups like him more than they used to,

494
00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:52.650
not less like four years of ubiquitous media coverage telling them he's

495
00:26:52.651 --> 00:26:56.550
awful racist, bigot, all this stuff. And that they're awful if they like it.

496
00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.000
So that didn't work. Oh, and by the way, I mean, even just today,

497
00:27:00.001 --> 00:27:04.680
there was a Congressman, a democratic Congresswoman who was saying, uh, defund,

498
00:27:04.681 --> 00:27:07.620
the police killed us, killed us.

499
00:27:07.621 --> 00:27:10.080
That is why we went down in the house instead of up.

500
00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:12.750
And if we don't abandon that ridiculous messaging,

501
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:17.130
we're going to see a blood bath in two years. So woke is, um, you know,

502
00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:20.640
that the messaging was proven to be a failure when it comes to electoral

503
00:27:20.641 --> 00:27:24.090
politics, but to have wanted to hear them, that's not going to stop anything.

504
00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.930
But for the reasons I was saying, it's ideological,

505
00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:32.100
it makes them feel like better people superior. Um,

506
00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:33.570
I don't know if it's their guilt,

507
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:37.710
if it's just the virtue signaling makes them feel great about themselves and bed

508
00:27:37.711 --> 00:27:41.010
at night when they judge other people and decide they're all bad.

509
00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:42.960
So we're going to have to deal with it.

510
00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:47.070
And the people who are don't believe in this BS culture,

511
00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.980
and there's so many people in the center, right,

512
00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.600
who don't eat and look at the Harper's Le leather letter,

513
00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:54.600
look at people like Andrew Sullivan who hated Trump, but you know,

514
00:27:54.601 --> 00:27:56.760
he's completely taken a stand against this baloney.

515
00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.720
They're going to have to speak up. They're the people who are against it.

516
00:28:00.721 --> 00:28:01.740
I know they're afraid.

517
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:05.940
I know you can get fired now for the most ridiculous reasons. Trust me. I know

518
00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:11.370
we're going to have to start taking risks. Otherwise we're all going to go down.

519
00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:13.800
You're going to go down together on this war. Yeah.

520
00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:15.470
<v 2>On a personal note,</v>

521
00:28:15.471 --> 00:28:19.430
as you were watching the election and you're not in the big studio and do it,

522
00:28:19.431 --> 00:28:22.540
all that stuff that you've done in the past. Did, did,

523
00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:25.700
did you enjoy it more in a weird way because you could just kind of watch it and

524
00:28:25.701 --> 00:28:27.970
be on your couch or where you on your couch.

525
00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:31.430
<v 0>I was, yeah. I was doing a bunch of hits from here, my living room.</v>

526
00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.353
So I will say.

527
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:36.950
<v 2>You were, you were on daily wire right before me that night you were home. Yeah.</v>

528
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:38.023
<v 0>You know, can I tell you honestly,</v>

529
00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.400
that was the first time that I've actually missed being on TV.

530
00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:44.420
Since I went off TV, I loved those big election nights and I,

531
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:46.880
I think I know how to anchor them. Well, you know, and I,

532
00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.180
it's one of those things where if you're a strong pitcher and you see somebody

533
00:28:50.181 --> 00:28:54.050
else pitching in the big game, you're like, Hmm, I wish I could be doing it.

534
00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.320
So that was like one of the first nights I think that I actually thought, Oh,

535
00:28:57.321 --> 00:28:58.160
I'd love to be out there,

536
00:28:58.161 --> 00:29:01.310
but that's not to not to disparage anybody who was out there.

537
00:29:01.311 --> 00:29:04.040
Just that I sort of missed throwing my fast ball. Yeah.

538
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:09.200
<v 2>So, so what's next then for the meat, uh, Megan, Kelly, media empire,</v>

539
00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:13.880
if you miss that sense, I send something. You just said you missed something.

540
00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:18.590
<v 0>Not at all. No, no, no, no. I love what I'm doing. I'm I am loving my podcast.</v>

541
00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:22.700
It's like, I'm home. I chose. Right. This is exactly right. For me,

542
00:29:22.701 --> 00:29:27.620
it's a new forum. It's one in which I can use all aspects of my personality.

543
00:29:27.621 --> 00:29:29.240
You know, it's like, I'm loving it,

544
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.850
but that doesn't mean it can scratch every edge,

545
00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:36.350
but I have no desire to go back to Fox or cable news at all. I, you know,

546
00:29:36.351 --> 00:29:39.530
as you know, I left it for very good reasons. That could be 11,

547
00:29:39.531 --> 00:29:40.670
nine and seven right now.

548
00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:43.810
And they're more important to me than taking care of that.

549
00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:44.700
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

550
00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:49.050
I don't think that I asked you this when I had you on a couple of weeks ago,

551
00:29:49.051 --> 00:29:53.970
but what is your sort of philosophical or

552
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:56.640
religious? Like what is your,

553
00:29:56.670 --> 00:30:00.360
like the thing that's beneath politics that kind of keeps you sane throughout

554
00:30:00.361 --> 00:30:00.720
this?

555
00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:04.020
Cause when we're talking about the people that use this in a religious nature

556
00:30:04.021 --> 00:30:05.640
and how woke ism has,

557
00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:08.790
has caused so much destruction and caused people to become believers who

558
00:30:08.791 --> 00:30:11.490
otherwise, usually aren't believers in a traditional sense.

559
00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:15.330
I find the only people that are making sense to me these days are people that

560
00:30:15.331 --> 00:30:19.380
come at it from some sort of belief aspect. I'm not,

561
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:22.320
they can have very various versions of it, but like,

562
00:30:22.321 --> 00:30:26.070
what is like beneath just your political outlook of life?

563
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:27.360
<v 0>Well, it's,</v>

564
00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.870
it's more like it's above my political outlook of life and I just feel like

565
00:30:30.871 --> 00:30:34.410
politics is over here. And, um, this is like,

566
00:30:34.411 --> 00:30:37.890
something we talk about is that it's not, it's not who I am.

567
00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:39.660
It's not really that important to me.

568
00:30:39.661 --> 00:30:42.210
I have to get involved because it brings up important fights.

569
00:30:42.211 --> 00:30:45.990
That one must fight and, and I cover it, you know, as a,

570
00:30:45.991 --> 00:30:50.790
as a journalist and a commentator. But when I, I am a woman of faith,

571
00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.190
I'm not particularly observant in my Catholicism,

572
00:30:53.191 --> 00:30:56.880
but I was raised Catholic and I have that moral imprint on me. Um,

573
00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:00.450
and I believe in God and I totally believe in an afterlife and a higher power.

574
00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:02.880
And I,

575
00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:07.410
I guess I just believe what we're here for is our human connections and not any

576
00:31:07.411 --> 00:31:09.000
of this BS. This is,

577
00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:12.840
this is small stuff that people use to who enjoy

578
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:16.290
divisiveness. They enjoy hostility.

579
00:31:16.291 --> 00:31:20.130
And I really believe a lot of them have too little fulfillment in their own

580
00:31:20.131 --> 00:31:23.070
lives. And they, you know, the smaller your life gets,

581
00:31:23.071 --> 00:31:27.540
the more you feel the need to, to fill it with something else. Be it drama,

582
00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:31.800
be it anger fighting. I'm not in that boat.

583
00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:36.450
I am feeling the main pitcher over here. PITC AGR,

584
00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:41.580
my children, my husband, my marriage, my friendships, my self, my, my,

585
00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:44.910
you know, my enjoyment in life. And then politics over here.

586
00:31:44.911 --> 00:31:47.640
And I take it swim over and I'll fight where I need to fight.

587
00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.910
But I just think people who have nothing to like remind them,

588
00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:55.800
it's just a limited time. We're here together. Um, make,

589
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:58.560
make bad choices and I'll put one period on it.

590
00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:03.450
I interviewed Adam Corolla recently who I just adore. And he said, it's such a,

591
00:32:03.451 --> 00:32:04.890
in such a good way. He said,

592
00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:10.320
I have no time for people who obsess over people who are

593
00:32:10.321 --> 00:32:14.490
generally good, but sometimes say controversial things or do,

594
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.150
and, and he, because I was asking him, how is he,

595
00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.790
how's he best friends with Jimmy Kimmel, right? Who like,

596
00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:25.740
doesn't seem to really like conservatives and Adam pretty much is like, what,

597
00:32:25.741 --> 00:32:30.690
how does that work? And he just sees everybody in terms of like, look,

598
00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:35.460
that's not a bad person there. Who's like doing good things. Like even like AOC,

599
00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.820
right? She's not a bad person. She's young. She's a whippersnappers.

600
00:32:38.821 --> 00:32:41.930
She herself elected to Congress from being a bartender. I mean,

601
00:32:41.931 --> 00:32:44.840
on some level you got to respect that you don't have to agree with the word she

602
00:32:44.841 --> 00:32:47.840
says politically, and you don't have to like her judgements of other people,

603
00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:51.230
but like, should we be focused on tearing down? Uh,

604
00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:55.220
let's see that the civilian AOC is of the world now. I'm like, I don't,

605
00:32:55.221 --> 00:32:58.520
we get so upset about them. They might be a minor, minor irritant, you know,

606
00:32:58.521 --> 00:32:59.240
like sunny Haas.

607
00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.670
And I was just ripping on her because she's got hostility for everybody.

608
00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:04.520
Do we really need to worry about the sunny houses? No.

609
00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:08.450
Should fight the political battles, which is don't get so upset personally,

610
00:33:08.451 --> 00:33:11.690
over these people. And like, you know, when it's coming into your life and it's,

611
00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:16.580
it has the power to like fire you or make you lose your job or make

612
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:20.660
endanger your children, you got to perk up and you got to pay attention,

613
00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:25.010
but you don't have to get personally offended by everything.

614
00:33:25.011 --> 00:33:26.240
Somebody else stands for.

615
00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:31.270
<v 2>You know, you did it to me last time. And you did it this time, which is,</v>

616
00:33:31.271 --> 00:33:31.511
you know,

617
00:33:31.511 --> 00:33:34.630
how to end an interview because we could keep going here and talk more about

618
00:33:34.631 --> 00:33:37.180
politics or the election. But I think that, that was it. That was it.

619
00:33:37.181 --> 00:33:40.540
I'm not going to drag out anything else. That that was just perfect.

620
00:33:40.541 --> 00:33:45.070
So we are going to link to the podcast down below. Thanks.

624
00:33:57.911 --> 00:34:00.970
the husband and the husband. And hopefully we'll,
