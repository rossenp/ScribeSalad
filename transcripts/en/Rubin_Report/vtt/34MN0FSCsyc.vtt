1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.300
<v 0>I have a concern about critical, critical theory, critical this, this whole,</v>

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:04.830
this whole, everything that's happening right now.

3
00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:08.370
I believe it was a Trojan horse. I believe that that, um,

4
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.010
that James Lindsey and how he described it as a Trojan horse,

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.580
is he's exactly right on it's coming into our churches. Um,

6
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.850
do the division that it's causing right now is insane because like you said,

7
00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:25.620
it's another gospel. It's another religion it's like, uh, because once again,

8
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.760
they have their own epistemology. So the way that they discover truth is,

9
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.020
is from a positional standpoint. So, so how do I respond to that.

10
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.690
<v 2>Before you mentioned the sort of lefty versus conservative,</v>

11
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.430
uh, demographics that you're dealing with in the church? Um,

12
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.510
so as we've watched this culture war just like explode all over the place,

13
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.120
I know that all sorts of churches, temples,

14
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.670
virtually every organization,

15
00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:06.230
secular or not is dealing with some sort of like internal split over how to

16
00:01:06.231 --> 00:01:08.870
deal with everything that's happening these days,

17
00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:12.980
literally from Corona virus to black lives matter and everything in between.

18
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.010
What, what version of that are you seeing these days?

19
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.153
<v 0>Yeah. Uh,</v>

20
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.380
there's definitely a political part of everything. Um,

21
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.010
and dude, this is insane. Like it's insane. I keep on telling my friends.

22
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.000
I'm sure that all your friends are just going, what, what is happening in 2020?

23
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.300
Um, you know, for there, there's a, there's a,

24
00:01:35.301 --> 00:01:37.430
there's a conversation in the church right now,

25
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.110
politically about the threshold of, um,

26
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.610
the threshold of religious Liberty versus, um, you know,

27
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.570
government needing to, you know, keep it, uh,

28
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.490
tabs and a lid on coronavirus. Um, and so we're kind of, I guess,

29
00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.050
exploring that threshold, um, you know, you got people who,

30
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.120
uh, th that's that's, that's absolutely fine falls along ideological lines,

31
00:02:05.121 --> 00:02:07.970
right? So there's, there's, it seems like there's two types of Americans.

32
00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:12.800
There's ones that want to, they, they, they have a huge trust in the government.

33
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.030
My wife is one of my wife is an Australian. I'm a Canadian,

34
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.480
but my wife is like, she trusts the government. She's just like, they are,

35
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.810
you know, they love us and I want to be, she told me last night, she's like,

36
00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:28.670
I want to be nannied. I like, like a hot moment. Um, I was just like,

37
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.020
have you read all of that? Totally. Um, so there, you got my,

38
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.430
my wife, Jasmine, and then you got me and I'm like the most distrusting,

39
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.500
uh, you know, uh, person of, of government because yeah, I, you know,

40
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.010
like they, uh, who are these angels, you know,

41
00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:51.470
like the old argument who are these angels that are going to make all these

42
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.700
rights decisions for us. So there's that,

43
00:02:52.701 --> 00:02:57.110
that's a huge conversation of the church and that alone Dave was tearing us

44
00:02:57.111 --> 00:02:58.550
apart. Right? Like,

45
00:02:58.551 --> 00:03:02.620
so you got pastors like calling up pastors or people calling up people like in

46
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:04.450
the, in the faith community, just being like,

47
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.890
you need to trust the government authorities from God. And then, um,

48
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.990
and then now you have, of course, uh, you know, George Floyd's death,

49
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.680
which was horrific and tragic. Um, and, uh,

50
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.440
you have black lives matter. Um, the organization, um,

51
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.700
that's kind of, uh,

52
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.010
occupied some space in wake of the George Floyd killing and then a

53
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.330
mod Arbery, um, because it, it looks,

54
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.680
um,

55
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.570
it looks from social media that young black men are

56
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:45.010
being hunted down and killed. Um, so, so yeah,

57
00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:47.590
you have this major space and it's it,

58
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:49.660
this is another thing that's kind of dividing us right now.

59
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:52.990
It's just like the narrative to believe and, um,

60
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.650
and what we ought to do about it. And, and regardless of if you,

61
00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.350
if you believe that narrative or not, you know,

62
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.960
Christians are called to mourn with those who mourn and weep with those who

63
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:05.470
weep. Um, so finding that threshold of going, okay,

64
00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:08.620
I might not agree with the political narrative,

65
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.080
but I'm called to, uh, to stand alongside, you know,

66
00:04:14.081 --> 00:04:18.370
people who are in my life that regardless of whether I know it, whether or not,

67
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:21.760
I believe that they are, their emotions are rooted in any kind of reality.

68
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.670
And I'm arguing from a, you know, if you're a conservative, you know,

69
00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:28.180
like I I've, I have a responsibility towards them to love them. You know,

70
00:04:28.181 --> 00:04:31.510
like my wife is terrified of airplanes. Um,

71
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.050
it's not rooted in anything logical at all. Um,

72
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.100
but I'm the one that's stuck holding the bag and comforting her and getting her

73
00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:42.820
Xanax when we're on a flight. And, you know, so there's an element of that.

74
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.980
If you're a conservative, uh,

75
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.450
that you have a responsibility towards the people that you're in community with

76
00:04:49.451 --> 00:04:52.870
and you're living life with, and, you know, you know,

77
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.210
quoting stats at my wife, doesn't help her flight anxiety,

78
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.490
you know, like, so finding how is the mess right now?

79
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.941
<v 2>Yeah. How,</v>

80
00:05:04.941 --> 00:05:09.870
how worried are you though that letting in this sort of different,

81
00:05:09.871 --> 00:05:13.620
what I would call a religious belief system, social justice,

82
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.310
that once it enters the institution enters the church,

83
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.690
that in many ways it will just, it will rot from the inside.

84
00:05:21.691 --> 00:05:23.760
All of the good things that you've been talking about. I mean,

85
00:05:23.761 --> 00:05:27.060
this is what we've sort of seen happen to every secular institution it's

86
00:05:27.061 --> 00:05:29.880
happening to the New York times, it's happening to the Washington post,

87
00:05:29.881 --> 00:05:34.440
it's happening to Harvard and Princeton and all of our liberal institutions. Um,

88
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.970
so I'm sort of fascinated where with this idea that it could be entering,

89
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.541
you know,

90
00:05:39.541 --> 00:05:44.010
sort of conservative or religious institutions and that they may not even have

91
00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:47.850
the correct defense mechanisms to, to purge it, or.

92
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.240
<v 0>That's exactly what's happening. So it's not necessarily,</v>

93
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.580
so for me, I've tried to dance line where like, you know,

94
00:05:58.581 --> 00:06:02.450
the idea of black lives matter is like, it's an idea.

95
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:06.650
It's a saying I've sort of divorced it from the organization.

96
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.200
Um, they don't like that, but sourced it from the organization because,

97
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.880
you know, the black lives do matter. And so if there are instances of where,

98
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:21.190
you know, there's police brutality that doesn't seem to fit, you know,

99
00:06:21.191 --> 00:06:23.710
the resident, I mean, you know, as if, as we, as we examine the data,

100
00:06:23.711 --> 00:06:26.980
that's one of the big ones that we know that, that, you know, the, uh,

101
00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:31.720
Harvard Rowan's, um, uh, his paper,

102
00:06:31.721 --> 00:06:35.260
and we know that the, the study that was done, uh,

103
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.270
Heather McDonald obviously lays this all out.

104
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.980
But one of the things that I have a giant question Mark over is the police

105
00:06:41.981 --> 00:06:46.930
brutality part. Um, I don't know if we're nailing that, you know, well, and so,

106
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.860
uh, let's say that you're like me where you're going, okay. The shooting part,

107
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.020
you know, there's, there's no racial bias.

108
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.470
That's been detected by three major studies. Um,

109
00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.220
but police brutality, do you have a question on that? Like,

110
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.390
why are 30% of blacks being, you know, accused of resisting arrest?

111
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.100
Are they resisting? Is that what's happening or the police, you know, being, um,

112
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.110
antagonistic towards them or whatever. So, so let's, let's just say for example,

113
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.260
that there is some antagonism, it needs to be dialed back.

114
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:25.210
Um, so I stand with my brother who feels he's, he's terrified.

115
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.760
Okay. And he's, and he's like, Nate, you know, like,

116
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.450
I just feel like black doesn't matter. Okay. Man, black lives matter. Okay.

117
00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:34.630
I'm with you on black lives. Like I'll say that now the organization,

118
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.020
they believe in the [inaudible] of the family,

119
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.880
which is doing nobody a service, particularly the black community in America.

120
00:07:42.881 --> 00:07:46.750
Right. So, um, so, so for me,

121
00:07:46.751 --> 00:07:51.490
obviously I have some fat or theological concerns to fry. Um,

122
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:55.950
but I'm walking this line where I'm in community with, with, with,

123
00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.910
with my black brothers and sisters. And so, um, so for me,

124
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.960
like once again, I have a concern about critical, critical theory,

125
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.960
critical this, this whole, this whole, everything that's happening right now,

126
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:11.530
I believe it was a Trojan horse. I believe that, that, um,

127
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:17.260
that Jane Lindsey and how he described it as a Trojan horses,

128
00:08:17.261 --> 00:08:20.740
he's exactly right on it's coming into our churches. Um,

129
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:24.010
do the division that it's causing right now is insane because like you said,

130
00:08:24.011 --> 00:08:27.940
it's another gospel. It's another one religion. It's like, uh,

131
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.430
because once yeah, they have their own epistemology.

132
00:08:30.431 --> 00:08:35.050
So the way that they discovered truth is, is from a positional standpoint.

133
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.730
So, so how do I respond to that? It's, it's, it's,

134
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:43.810
it's almost an impossible dance, but I have to show rational compassion,

135
00:08:43.811 --> 00:08:48.400
not empathy, because empathy, uh, is,

136
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.060
you know, as, as we've seen in the last, like 10,

137
00:08:52.061 --> 00:08:56.640
15 years in psychology is dangerous and your biases come into empathy,

138
00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.040
I have to have what's called rational compassion.

139
00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:02.280
So I have to reasonably move through the data,

140
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:07.050
move through the things that are happening using my Christian worldview and

141
00:09:07.051 --> 00:09:11.190
frame and framework and my epistemology, you know, and,

142
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.510
and then as I'm checking these, these movements and going, okay, these were,

143
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:19.300
are man's right. Cause everything has a demand. We demand that no,

144
00:09:19.301 --> 00:09:22.770
that you overhaul, uh, you know, as James says, you know,

145
00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:25.020
you can't tear down the master's house, the master's tools.

146
00:09:25.021 --> 00:09:29.610
So we have to completely change how we structure, not,

147
00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:32.490
not just the way we structured our church organization,

148
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:37.530
but we also demand that like the way that you go about finding

149
00:09:37.531 --> 00:09:42.090
truth changes as well. And so at that point, um,

150
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:45.900
for me, I'm not going to fight peripherals like in any good argument,

151
00:09:45.901 --> 00:09:48.420
you always argue first principles. So you don't argue peripherals.

152
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:52.050
And so for me, when it comes to the black lives matter movement,

153
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.890
when it comes to the things that are happening on the streets and the protests,

154
00:09:55.891 --> 00:09:59.760
et cetera, I'm not going to, there are some things I think that are peripheral.

155
00:09:59.761 --> 00:10:03.750
And as conservatives, we get a little bit sidetracked by. And so to me,

156
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:08.130
the critical theory thing, and this is why I think James Lindsey, um,

157
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.880
is just so on the money right now is because it's the,

158
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:16.200
you don't go after the fruit. You go after the root. And to me,
