00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.420
<v 0>This is the big lie that you have spoken out against for a long time,</v>

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.610
or you should feel very vindicated over the past few minutes,

3
00:00:05.611 --> 00:00:09.060
pretty vindicated lately, because the big lie we've always heard is, Oh,

4
00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:12.240
these college campuses, these are just a bunch of idiots.

5
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.260
Just wait until they get out into the real world. Well, uh,

6
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.180
I'm looking around the real world now,

7
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.270
and I'm seeing the consequences of those college campuses.

8
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.610
As the buildings are burning down all around the country.

9
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.410
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

10
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.510
<v 2>People over the last, you know, five years,</v>

11
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.810
we're yelling at guys like us for talking about what was going on on college

12
00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:42.380
campuses. Oh, it's just a bunch of kids, you know? And it's like,

13
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.250
actually you do know that this is leaking out into society and these people are

14
00:00:46.251 --> 00:00:50.210
graduating and they're starting to take down institutions.

15
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.530
Literally you have young editors at publishing houses that are getting books

16
00:00:54.531 --> 00:00:58.160
canceled at the New York times. And the New York times has been taken up.

17
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.050
Do you think this thing is going to destroy virtually every liberal

18
00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:04.640
institution? So we have.

19
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.150
<v 0>This is the big lie that you have spoken out against for a long time,</v>

20
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.340
or you should feel very vindicated over the past few minutes,

21
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.790
pretty vindicated lately, because the big lie we've always heard is, Oh,

22
00:01:13.791 --> 00:01:16.970
these college campuses, these are just a bunch of idiots.

23
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.990
Just wait until they get out into the real world. Well, uh,

24
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.910
I'm looking around the real world now,

25
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.000
and I'm seeing the consequences of those college campuses.

26
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.020
As the buildings are burning down all around the country, the,

27
00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:31.310
the issue with the institutions you bring up is a,

28
00:01:31.311 --> 00:01:35.600
is an interesting one because we've been told for the past few weeks

29
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.100
that all of these protests are about institutional racism, right?

30
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.990
But then it occurred to me,

31
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.490
the left controls every major institution in America. Yeah.

32
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.120
Control the media controls, higher education and lower education controls.

33
00:01:50.121 --> 00:01:53.000
Hollywood controls, big tech controls, administrative government control,

34
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.350
basically other than talk radio and some little parts of the internet,

35
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.400
the left controls every institution. So if there's institutional racism,

36
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.840
whose fault is that?

37
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.340
<v 2>Well, not only whose fault is it,</v>

38
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.150
but they are the ones putting it into the institutions.

39
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.130
They're the ones making it systemic. Harvard.

40
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.540
Harvard says we want less Asian people because you guys have had it too good

41
00:02:14.541 --> 00:02:18.980
through hard work and education. So we're going to Institute a racist policy.

42
00:02:18.981 --> 00:02:22.280
I don't know if you saw it. I just tweeted last night or this morning, uh,

43
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.820
this thing in, in Tacoma, Washington, where they're now go,

44
00:02:25.821 --> 00:02:30.740
it is going to be in practice that if you have lost your job or need

45
00:02:30.741 --> 00:02:32.240
housing, because of COVID,

46
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.280
they're only going to help people who identify as people of color.

47
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.630
<v 0>You might have something. I might, you know, the Sicilians wiggle room here,</v>

48
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.690
right? I mean, you see that you saw this with Uber eats, right?

49
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.390
Uber eats love this one. They come out. They say,

50
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.880
if you're ordering from a black owned business, whatever that is, I don't know.

51
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.160
How are you going to measure the equity here? A black owned business.

52
00:02:55.161 --> 00:02:57.770
There's no delivery fees, but if it's a white owned business,

53
00:02:57.771 --> 00:03:00.460
there will be delivered. They are the ones actually.

54
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.740
<v 2>Injecting racism into the system. Of course.</v>

55
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.160
<v 0>But that's the point. You know, I, it occurred to me.</v>

56
00:03:05.161 --> 00:03:09.990
I thought a friend came up to me the other day said, Michael,

57
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.050
it's almost like they want us to be racist.

58
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.900
They're tr they're the mainstream media, the left,

59
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.480
they're ginning up this racial division. It's like, they want us to be racist.

60
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.130
And I realize they do.

61
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.480
They actually need you to be racist because so much of liberalism

62
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.350
is about overcoming this oppressive past, right?

63
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.100
So the whole story of liberalism is you can't end. It can't end. It's got,

64
00:03:32.101 --> 00:03:34.970
you've always got to be freeing yourself, but look around you.

65
00:03:34.971 --> 00:03:36.240
You remember early on in the riots,

66
00:03:36.241 --> 00:03:38.370
the mainstream media tried to blame white supremacists.

67
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.180
How many Klansmen are there in America? Like four left or something.

68
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.910
But I don't, I didn't see a whole lot of white hoods out there. I saw,

69
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.880
I saw a white hood on the governor of Virginia, the Democrat, Ralph Northam.

70
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.890
I didn't see it in the riots. So they,

71
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.780
they have to either create this boogeyman or actually try to create racists

72
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.510
if only to have a villain to then overcome.

73
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.170
<v 2>Well, also, when they're going through these cities, destroying everything,</v>

74
00:04:01.171 --> 00:04:02.400
we were talking about West Hollywood,

75
00:04:02.401 --> 00:04:05.640
which is literally the gayest place on earth.

76
00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:10.500
They have rainbow crosswalks, the entire West Hollywood right now, as we tape,

77
00:04:10.501 --> 00:04:13.290
this is boarded up. I used to live there. I went there a couple of days ago.

78
00:04:13.291 --> 00:04:16.920
It is boarded up. It looks like a third world nation. And on every sign outside,

79
00:04:16.921 --> 00:04:21.840
it says, BLM, the implication being don't destroy our business. We're for you.

80
00:04:21.841 --> 00:04:24.600
Black lives matters, but help watch what I can do here.

81
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.740
If it was white supremacists that were rampaging through the neighborhood,

82
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.280
wouldn't you be writing like white power on the side, because then you go, I'm,

83
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.170
I'm a white supremacist. You're a white supremacist.

84
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.820
Don't don't bust up my business.

85
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.450
<v 0>And also it's worth noting. This is pride month, right?</v>

86
00:04:39.451 --> 00:04:42.000
So I call me grower. I'm not an expert.

87
00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:46.110
I thought this was supposed to be the month to celebrate West Hollywood and the

88
00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:47.280
LGBT community,

89
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.380
but that it progressivism changes so fast that now pride

90
00:04:52.381 --> 00:04:55.110
month is canceled. And now pride month is BLM month.

91
00:04:55.111 --> 00:04:55.980
What's it going to be next year?

92
00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.810
<v 2>You remember a couple of years ago at Toronto pride when they stop BLM</v>

93
00:05:00.811 --> 00:05:03.870
stopped the March and said, you guys can't March any further,

94
00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:07.740
unless you sign our edict or our, whatever it is.

95
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.780
And basically they did.

96
00:05:09.781 --> 00:05:12.360
And they let them March in a bunch of us talked about it and they said, Oh,

97
00:05:12.361 --> 00:05:16.140
here you go again here. When you guys go again, this.

98
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.250
<v 0>This issue of the, the intersectional politics. It's,</v>

99
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.140
it's an interesting one here because you're almost seeing the return of more of

100
00:05:25.141 --> 00:05:27.960
an old school Marxism. You know, for the past 10 years,

101
00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:31.500
you've been hearing about how the gay community has something in common with the

102
00:05:31.501 --> 00:05:32.490
trans community.

103
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.250
Just kind of ironic because those two communities sort of contradict one

104
00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:36.400
another. Either. There,

105
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.460
there are individual sexes and same-sex attraction is having to do

106
00:05:41.461 --> 00:05:43.830
with the two sexes or there's no such thing as sexes.

107
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.160
And so that contradicts the G and the LGBT, right?

108
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.590
But those have something to do together. You're gonna have Gloria Steinem,

109
00:05:49.591 --> 00:05:53.310
radical feminist holding hands with Linda Sarsour and islamised at the women's

110
00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:55.260
March. And that makes sense. But now you're seeing that,

111
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.210
I think begin to fade away a little bit into more of an old school.

112
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.640
The black lives matter interest is not the LGBT interest and the

113
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:07.820
BLM one is going to take precedence, even though all of,

114
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.870
all of it comes down to a sort of radical Marxism. And this,

115
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.780
this is the part that I think some of the squishy types don't yet,

116
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.240
because they'll say, they'll say the word black lives matter.

117
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.620
Nobody disagrees with that. Here's my evidence that nobody disagrees with that.

118
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.910
Everybody posted the black square on social media, everybody,

119
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.320
everybody in government, in media, in corporate America, in all your friends,

120
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.610
they all did it. It's no one disagrees with that stuff.

121
00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.240
<v 2>Yeah. Even people that didn't want to do it,</v>

122
00:06:34.241 --> 00:06:36.550
not because they're not for black lives,

123
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.070
but because they don't like being bullied into things, they did it too.

124
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.850
<v 0>They did it too. But then you look at the black lives matter website,</v>

125
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.870
the about us section, and it's not just about black lives mattering.

126
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.050
At one point, it says we exist to destroy the quote,

127
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.360
Western prescribed nuclear family. What,

128
00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.950
uh, what does that have to do with police brutality or it's obviously,

129
00:06:59.951 --> 00:07:03.970
and you can see the founders of BLM come from radical leftist organizations,

130
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.730
which get their funding from the open societies foundation,

131
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.320
which is run by George Soros.

132
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.260
That's that's not a conspiracy theory with nonprofits. It's not,

133
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.200
it's not anti-Semitic to say that. I don't even know how would it be?

134
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:19.390
<v 2>We're Soros has lived his life to basically fund every Jew hating</v>

135
00:07:19.391 --> 00:07:21.240
thing. There is pretty much right, right.

136
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.260
He would love to have Israel wiped off the map.

137
00:07:23.261 --> 00:07:26.860
So the idea that saying that George Soros funds these things is antisemitic.

138
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.860
<v 0>Right? It'd be, it becomes what,</v>

139
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.490
what the left wants to pretend is that this is a racial issue primarily,

140
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.090
and it's not the left uses race all the time, but it's not.

141
00:07:37.091 --> 00:07:40.390
You can see when you look at the about us section of the BLM page,

142
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:44.200
when you look at who's funding, it it's primarily ideological.

143
00:07:44.201 --> 00:07:48.700
And I think there are some squishy conservatives and Republicans who want to go

144
00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:51.250
along with it because they they're afraid of being called racist,

145
00:07:51.251 --> 00:07:54.250
even when they're not at all racist, but that's a,

146
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.900
that's a very bad deal to get into.

147
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.710
Cause then you're accepting radical leftist premises that are going to undercut

148
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:00.880
everything you stand for.

149
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.320
<v 2>In many ways though,</v>

150
00:08:02.321 --> 00:08:07.180
do you think the ship has sailed to the point that we don't

151
00:08:07.181 --> 00:08:10.150
have enough power to fix this thing that,

152
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.630
that you're laying out since and,

153
00:08:13.631 --> 00:08:17.770
and thoughtful analysis and people are waking up to it.

154
00:08:17.771 --> 00:08:20.890
And I do think a ton of red people are being red pilled right now because,

155
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.280
because just reality is red pilling them, right? I've got Hollywood lefties,

156
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.430
friends that are calling me and they're like, where do you get a gun?

157
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.280
So it's like, so something's happening here. But in many ways,

158
00:08:30.281 --> 00:08:34.000
do you think that the destructive force of this thing has,

159
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:39.100
has so infiltrated everything that nothing can, can return?

160
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.530
<v 0>You've hit the nail on the head, which is,</v>

161
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.780
we were beginning to see more people than just conservatives or classical

162
00:08:46.781 --> 00:08:51.250
liberals or just normal people are seeing yikes.

163
00:08:51.251 --> 00:08:52.990
Something has gone seriously wrong here.

164
00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:56.070
And yet very little is being done to it. You see,

165
00:08:56.071 --> 00:08:59.040
even the president of the United States, more or less,

166
00:08:59.041 --> 00:09:01.950
all he can do is tweet about it. And people were saying, okay, enough tweeting.

167
00:09:01.951 --> 00:09:05.460
You got to actually do something, but it gets back to the institution's issue.

168
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.570
The left controls, the institutions, which means the left controls,

169
00:09:09.571 --> 00:09:10.620
the levers of power.

170
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:14.610
The only institution that we've got on the right is talking.

171
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.040
And so we can talk until we're blue in the face.

172
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.030
We can point out hypocrisy until we're blue in the face. And the left says,

173
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:25.440
yeah, okay. You've pointed out my hypocrisy. I still have the levers of power.

174
00:09:25.441 --> 00:09:29.970
I think what is required now of the Rite and of conservatives is to

175
00:09:29.971 --> 00:09:33.210
take back it actual institutions of power.

176
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.250
And perhaps even more importantly,

177
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.360
to be willing to exercise that political power when we have the ability to.

178
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.780
<v 2>What does that mean? Rubber meets the road. What are you saying?</v>

179
00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:44.960
Like actually start separate universities. I mean,

180
00:09:44.961 --> 00:09:48.380
there are some more conservative leaning universities and some of them have

181
00:09:48.381 --> 00:09:51.320
thrived in the midst of all this and university of Chicago though. It's not,

182
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:52.880
it's not conservative per se,

183
00:09:52.881 --> 00:09:56.690
but they have actually instituted like an actual defense of free speech and they

184
00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.000
probably won't burn as quickly as the rest of these other places.

185
00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.760
But what do you actually mean by that? Like what,

186
00:10:00.761 --> 00:10:01.790
what is the institution building?

187
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.420
<v 0>So that would be a wonderful thing. I mean,</v>

188
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.630
unfortunately I could probably count the conservative universities on one hand

189
00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.300
and they're really great universities, I guess the,

190
00:10:11.301 --> 00:10:14.900
the silver lining and the storm cloud of the coronavirus lockdown and some of

191
00:10:14.901 --> 00:10:19.730
the riots is that you're seeing a collapse in many ways of this decrepit

192
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.410
educational infrastructure that,

193
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:26.570
that not only does not give people an education and it does not give people an

194
00:10:26.571 --> 00:10:30.290
ability to have a career. And it does saddle them with a lot of debt.

195
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:34.790
All it does is indoctrinate them in a very modern sort of politics,

196
00:10:34.791 --> 00:10:36.920
which is not worth the cost of admission.

197
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.340
<v 2>If you're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations about politics,</v>

198
00:10:40.341 --> 00:10:43.670
