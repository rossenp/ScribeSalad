1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.800
<v 0>It's challenging to go to the UN and participate in the system where the</v>

2
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:06.150
UN says, you know,

3
00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:09.840
we have this formula and every country gets to have a certain amount of people

4
00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:14.280
get jobs at the UN. So they look at the formula and they say, Oh, well,

5
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:16.410
how many people do we have from Nigeria? Oh,

6
00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:20.160
we need more go hire people into the system from Nigeria.

7
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.830
It tends to not be whether or not someone is qualified or has the skillset.

8
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.060
It is,

9
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.380
are we being fair and equal on the disbursement of jobs?

10
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.260
<v 1>And that's.</v>

11
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.960
<v 0>Where it breaks down because you're hiring people that really don't know what</v>

12
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:39.840
they're doing. And they waste money in the UN becomes a jobs program.

13
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.630
<v 2>Can you talk a little bit.</v>

14
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.070
<v 1>What about just generally what the state of the UN is and what it was like to be</v>

15
00:00:49.071 --> 00:00:49.431
there?

16
00:00:49.431 --> 00:00:53.900
And you know that so many people think that it's like this sort of perfect

17
00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:57.950
thing that the countries come together and figure out what's right.

18
00:00:57.951 --> 00:00:58.850
For everybody. Like,

19
00:00:58.851 --> 00:01:03.350
they love the idea of it more than I think functionally how it works or does not

20
00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:04.184
work.

21
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.710
<v 2>Well, first of all, the, uh.</v>

22
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.270
<v 0>I always try to correct people that, that the UN doesn't really exist.</v>

23
00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:15.710
The UN has member States, right? So when somebody says, Oh, the UN says, no,

24
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.730
I always say the UN doesn't say no members at the UN,

25
00:01:19.731 --> 00:01:23.030
maybe Russia and China got together in the security council and said, no,

26
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.900
but the UN doesn't take a position. And so I,

27
00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:30.080
I try to not just reflexively blame, Oh,

28
00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:33.440
the UN stopped something. Cause it's really member countries.

29
00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:35.360
That's the first thing. The second thing is,

30
00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:39.320
is the UN does not work unless the U S is leading it.

31
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.360
Whether it's the world food program, UNICEF UN DP, you know,

32
00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:48.350
the development programs, whatever it is, the U S has to be there.

33
00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:50.060
Otherwise the UN does not work.

34
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.590
The UN system is based on every country is equal.

35
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.800
Not every person is equal, it's every country.

36
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.170
And that's where I think as Americans, we say,

37
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.580
that's just fundamentally not true. Every country is not equal.

38
00:02:04.581 --> 00:02:06.590
So in the general assembly,

39
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.210
when we pretend that these small Island countries get the same vote as

40
00:02:11.211 --> 00:02:15.710
China or the United States, or, you know, the bigger economies,

41
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.570
um, that's kind of laughable, to be honest, I get that.

42
00:02:20.571 --> 00:02:24.530
We want to have a general assembly where people have the ability to talk,

43
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.660
but I don't love the idea of one country, one vote,

44
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.560
um, which I think is balanced by the security council and the,

45
00:02:33.561 --> 00:02:37.370
and the idea that the substantive work goes to the security council.

46
00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:40.550
So I get to the kind of separation. Um,

47
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.140
but it's challenging to go to the UN and participate in the system where

48
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.150
the UN says, you know,

49
00:02:47.151 --> 00:02:50.840
we have this formula and every country gets to have a certain amount of people

50
00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:55.280
get jobs at the UN. So they look at the formula and they say, Oh, well,

51
00:02:55.281 --> 00:02:57.410
how many people do we have from Nigeria? Oh,

52
00:02:57.411 --> 00:03:01.150
we need more go hire people into the system from Nigeria.

53
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.850
It tends to not be whether or not someone is qualified or has the skillset.

54
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.050
It is,

55
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.370
are we being fair and equal on the disbursement of jobs.

56
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.080
<v 1>Out of this idea lately?</v>

57
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.710
<v 0>And that's where it breaks down because you're hiring people that really don't</v>

58
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:20.800
know what they're doing. And they waste money in the UN becomes a jobs program.

59
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.760
<v 1>Is the UN better at certain things and worse at others.</v>

60
00:03:23.761 --> 00:03:27.120
So like when it comes to food disbursement or helping development,

61
00:03:27.121 --> 00:03:29.670
that kind of stuff, it seems like they're probably pretty decent at,

62
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.930
and then the security council or a lot of the rest of it seems like 90% of it is

63
00:03:33.931 --> 00:03:35.790
just voting against Israel for yeah.

64
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.760
<v 0>Yeah. For sure. Moving to rock. Um, yeah,</v>

65
00:03:38.761 --> 00:03:40.560
I think you hit it on the head is that, you know,

66
00:03:40.561 --> 00:03:45.060
we pay 25% of the UN bill and that's for the

67
00:03:45.061 --> 00:03:48.090
secretariat and the kind of UN administration.

68
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.450
<v 1>Parking tickets. Right. Isn't it, isn't the whole thing. Just parking tickets.</v>

69
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.050
Exactly. Not what they say. It's just ambassadors,

70
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.320
use the park wherever you want. Yeah.

71
00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.660
<v 0>Um, but at the same time, there are these what they call, um, uh,</v>

72
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.570
extra bodies, independent bodies,

73
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.440
and those are funded through voluntary contributions.

74
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.990
So world food program in UNICEF,

75
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.250
they don't get monies from the,

76
00:04:13.251 --> 00:04:17.730
the general fund of the 25% money that we give.

77
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.320
UNICEF only gets its budget by appealing to people say, to say,

78
00:04:22.321 --> 00:04:26.940
we've got a crisis we need to go out. And who, who wants to write us a check?

79
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.410
The Europeans, the Germans, the Americans, we fund the most on those,

80
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.100
a world food program, UNICEF type, uh, independent bodies.

81
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.210
That's why they're the well run is because we demand management,

82
00:04:39.211 --> 00:04:42.930
transparency and accountability, and these independent bodies,

83
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.250
we don't have that ability to do in the UN general assembly. So the,

84
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.080
you get this kind of

85
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.060
really blob type, uh,

86
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.310
management and,

87
00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.150
and mission from the actual UN operations.

88
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.380
<v 1>What is the obsession with Israel with the general assembly? I mean, every,</v>

89
00:05:04.381 --> 00:05:08.040
every time you look at that chart, it's like 90% of the condemnations.

90
00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:11.790
And you know that there's only one country that can't serve on the security

91
00:05:11.791 --> 00:05:13.350
council. That's Israel.

92
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.290
<v 0>I'm outraged by it. I'm telling you, I think that,</v>

93
00:05:16.291 --> 00:05:18.720
that the U S government should just put its foot down and say,

94
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.900
we're going to clear the deck and Israel should be on the security council,

95
00:05:21.901 --> 00:05:26.370
just to prove a point of, of, of getting them on the CA on the security council.

96
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.590
Um, it there's this fascination with condemning Israel.

97
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.430
It's why we got out of the human rights council is because, you know,

98
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.110
you've got nine resolutions on Israel and

99
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.520
nothing on, you know, Iran or, or, I mean, the word is out. If you,

100
00:05:44.521 --> 00:05:48.810
if you don't want to be condemned by the UN and you're a human rights abuser,

101
00:05:48.811 --> 00:05:52.050
then go run for the human rights council. So you can protect yourself, right.

102
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.080
<v 1>Trump somehow just gets all this.</v>

103
00:05:55.081 --> 00:05:59.240
Like he really has fixed a lot of this or is in the process of fixing it or.

104
00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.950
<v 0>No, he's not of the political establishment.</v>

105
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.380
And so he's willing to be a disruptor.

106
00:06:05.381 --> 00:06:10.270
We all know about disruptive technology and people who go

107
00:06:10.271 --> 00:06:14.050
in and say, gosh, everybody has group think, and you're missing the big,

108
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:15.970
you know, reform effort.

109
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:21.400
I think Americans really want Washington to be disrupted or the UN,

110
00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.710
they, they look at it and they say, what a waste? You know,

111
00:06:23.711 --> 00:06:24.880
why are we spending all that money?

112
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:28.500
But the system in Washington filled with lobbyists and,

113
00:06:28.501 --> 00:06:30.520
and all the people that take care of each other,

114
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.830
they don't want an outsider coming in and somehow wrecking

115
00:06:35.831 --> 00:06:40.120
their good fortune, you know? And, and we see that in Hollywood,

116
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.950
we see that same thing in Hollywood. And so I want to,

117
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.750
to applaud and do everything I can for president Trump, because first of all,

118
00:06:49.751 --> 00:06:50.950
he's got really thick skin.

119
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.570
All of the people who just constantly come at him for w thank God we got a

120
00:06:55.571 --> 00:06:59.710
president. Who's just really tough on that and doesn't care. And too,

121
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.550
he sees it for what it is. And he's not really that partisan. I mean,

122
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.660
I look at what I'm starting to call the Trump doctrine,

123
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.500
which I think is the Trump doctrine to foreign policy,

124
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.900
which is a dual approach to every single issue where you use every tool of

125
00:07:16.901 --> 00:07:19.210
the U S government economic tool,

126
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.620
sanctions pressure to change the behavior of a country.

127
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.450
And you really utilize that pressure in a strong way. At the same time,

128
00:07:28.451 --> 00:07:30.580
there's the separate path to say, let's talk,

129
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.680
let's sit down and have a diplomatic talk.

130
00:07:32.681 --> 00:07:35.650
He's doing it with Kim Jong-un and the,

131
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.570
the neo-cons and the traditional Republicans did not like him saying,

132
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:44.020
I'm going to just go talk to Kim Jong-un they only want to do the squeezing.

133
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.180
They don't always want to say, well,

134
00:07:46.181 --> 00:07:50.830
why not talk to see if we can test this talking as a tactic?

135
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.730
It's not, it's not the goal. Right? You see the, when you.

136
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.830
<v 1>Then like the never Trump conservative.</v>

137
00:07:56.831 --> 00:08:00.280
So like the bill crystals are just those guys that have sort of been around

138
00:08:00.281 --> 00:08:03.280
forever and who usually you've gotten everything wrong. Always,

139
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:07.180
are they different privately? Like, are they privately kind of like, yeah,

140
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:08.530
I like what he's doing. And he's.

141
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.550
<v 0>So I think the creatures of Washington, I think they live in Washington DC.</v>

142
00:08:12.551 --> 00:08:15.130
And they, they, they want people to play by the rules,

143
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.560
the people who benefit from the rules and,

144
00:08:17.561 --> 00:08:21.880
and they want everybody to come in and play by the rules are, uh,

145
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:26.050
on both sides of the aisle. This is not a partisan thing at all.

146
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:30.370
It's you got to come to our city and play by our rules because we got lobbyists

147
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:31.263
to take care of.

148
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.320
And we've got a system and everybody is participating in the system, right.

149
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.860
Marco Rubio actually talked about this just the other day.

150
00:08:38.861 --> 00:08:41.230
And I thought it was really good. He was, he was saying, look,

151
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.530
when I came to Washington and I didn't go to their cocktail parties,

152
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.960
I eventually didn't get invited to their cocktail parties.

153
00:08:46.961 --> 00:08:49.720
And then they started sniping at me because I wasn't going to their cocktail

154
00:08:49.721 --> 00:08:53.410
parties. And I, and they recognized that I wasn't playing by the rules.

155
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:58.290
And he said, Trump has done it, tenfold he's come in and, and, you know,

156
00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:02.550
completely, uh, double down on that. And, and I think it's right.

157
00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:05.520
I think we're getting senators. You know, Ron Johnson,

158
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:09.230
I think is another great Senator who doesn't play that game. And he,

159
00:09:09.231 --> 00:09:13.530
he comes from Wisconsin and plays a different tune,

160
00:09:13.531 --> 00:09:17.160
which is I'm fighting for the people of Wisconsin. Marco Rubio, I think,

161
00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:17.881
is doing that,

162
00:09:17.881 --> 00:09:22.380
that we have senators that are beginning to do that and

163
00:09:22.381 --> 00:09:26.550
challenge the system. Uh, and I think it's what the people want.

164
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.910
<v 1>Uh, so what's it like when Trump, Donald Trump, New York businessman,</v>

165
00:09:31.911 --> 00:09:35.420
Donald Trump, the guy becomes president, then I assume your phone rings one day.

166
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.440
And he says, I'm looking to send somebody over to Germany. Is it a phone call?

167
00:09:39.441 --> 00:09:41.930
Is it an email to someone else reach out to you first? How does that all work?

168
00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:46.400
<v 0>I had been, um, in and around the campaign quite a bit.</v>

169
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.300
And so there's always a constant conversation. Um,

170
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.530
and there's also, I think a question of like, who's loyal, right? Who, who,

171
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.670
who was here before all of the jobs were available, um,

172
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.730
who was committed. And I think they saw that I was very committed in,

173
00:10:02.731 --> 00:10:07.430
in the campaign. And so the conversation to me was,

174
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.830
you know, where do you see yourself in the administration,

175
00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:14.420
or do you want to join the administration? And so from the beginning,

176
00:10:14.421 --> 00:10:18.230
I just said, you know, some sort of a foreign policy role, you know, let's,

177
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.880
let's discuss. And then we had that conversation. And eventually I was like,

178
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:24.050
I think Germany is a good fit.

179
00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.500
