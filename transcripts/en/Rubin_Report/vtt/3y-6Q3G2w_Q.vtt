1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.620
<v 0>She is tarnishing every the reputation of every Muslim,</v>

2
00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:09.600
every American Muslim, and they know it now. And they,

3
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.970
I mean, I speak to, uh, I mean, to, uh, in, in the district,

4
00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:18.330
I speak to summaries and I speak to Muslims and they,

5
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.260
the majority agreed that she tarnish their reputation.

6
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.400
People there are not waiting just for handouts.

7
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.530
These are hard workers. The all that they want is to have better lives,

8
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.270
to send their kids to better school, to have a safe district.

9
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.990
<v 1>So what else are you going to do in Minnesota is fifth district to</v>

10
00:00:44.991 --> 00:00:46.580
supplant Ilhan Omar.

11
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.320
<v 0>Before that I am planning and I would represent</v>

12
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.393
every,

13
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.870
every voter in this district and not even a voter,

14
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.390
every resident of the fifth district,

15
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.440
because I am running to represent them. Um,

16
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.930
I'm planning to introduce Minneapolis and the

17
00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:10.430
fifth district to DC,

18
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.140
not bring DC to Minneapolis and to that district. Um,

19
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.950
she failed to do anything for them.

20
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.090
And for me, this is, I mean,

21
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.480
she's supposed to be a public servant.

22
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.370
A public servant means that you serve your constituents.

23
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.680
And that's what I'm planning to do. Um,

24
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.030
I will represent every residence of the fifth district,

25
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.230
regardless of color, ethnicity, faith,

26
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.600
and political affiliation.

27
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.600
<v 1>What do you think the Somali community thinks of her? So.</v>

28
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.580
<v 0>They are seriously,</v>

29
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.380
they are sick and tired of her scandals of her, uh, uh,

30
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.320
outside influences of her, uh,

31
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.910
narrative that she is tarnishing every,

32
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.930
the reputation of every Muslim, every American Muslim.

33
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.600
And they know it now. And they, I mean, I speak to,

34
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.600
I mean, to the district,

35
00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:17.960
I speak to summaries and I speak to Muslims and they,

36
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.890
the majority agreed that she tarnish their reputation.

37
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.000
People there are not waiting just for handouts.

38
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.130
These are hard workers. The all that they want is to have better lives,

39
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.410
to send their kids to better school, to have a safe district, the.

40
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.690
<v 1>Same thing as every other American. Exactly.</v>

41
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.640
<v 0>Exactly. We don't need names. We are all Americans. I don't, when I,</v>

42
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.240
when I travel, when people ask me, Oh, where are you from?

43
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.740
I don't say I'm an American. I am an American period.

44
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.270
And that's the values that I have are the American values.

45
00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.880
And the people I love are they Americans. It mean that I hate Iraq.

46
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.760
It's always my that's what I was born.

47
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:06.820
And these are my extended families.

48
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.290
But when it comes to my heart, my heart is here.

49
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:14.890
That's why I've been living here for 30 years and I'm not planning to go

50
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.330
anywhere. And that's why I have only one passport, which is the U S bank.

51
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.010
<v 1>Will you come on stage with me? I have a show in Minneapolis for my book tour.</v>

52
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.640
Tired. I'm going to bring you on stage. We'll we're going to do some stuff.

53
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.410
<v 0>Change your mind. I'll Sue you.</v>

54
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.850
<v 1>Well, now it's been recorded. All right, I'll get you the date,</v>

55
00:03:32.851 --> 00:03:35.130
but I'll be in Minneapolis around the May 10th or so separately.

56
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.060
<v 0>I wouldn't be honored to do so. I would be honored to.</v>

57
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.670
<v 1>Johann will not be happy with us. I'll invite her too, though.</v>

58
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.000
If she's watching right now, she's welcome to come on stage with both of us.

59
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.020
<v 0>I've been I've, I've been inviting you for</v>

60
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.830
a cup of coffee forever.

61
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.060
So I think maybe we should have coffee in the neighborhood that you don't live

62
00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.500
there anymore because you moved to DC. So I'm in Minneapolis. Where is she?

63
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.790
She's in DC.

64
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.840
<v 1>Yeah. Can you talk a little bit about some of the other scandals related to her?</v>

65
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.660
Cause there's a, there's a lot of weird stuff out there.

66
00:04:09.661 --> 00:04:12.300
And for the last two years, it was only these very,

67
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.040
I don't want to say very far, right?

68
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.270
It was a seemingly far right outlet,

69
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.970
or I don't even want to say that there were outlets on the right that are

70
00:04:20.971 --> 00:04:24.930
ignored by mainstream that were saying there was this weird thing with her and

71
00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:29.220
her brother and passports and this whole thing. Can you,

72
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.230
can you kind of get me up to speed on what.

73
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.030
<v 0>I mean, usually I don't speak about it, but it's, um,</v>

74
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.660
I mean,

75
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.340
there are investigations for about so many

76
00:04:41.341 --> 00:04:45.660
things. Like three, four for me, one is many. Yeah. Um,

77
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.370
and especially about the immigration fraud, because apparently based on,

78
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.880
uh, a community leader in,

79
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.230
in the Somali community came out and including,

80
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.660
uh, pictures. And, and let me tell you what happened.

81
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.250
And then hopefully, um,

82
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.780
the investigation would lead to, because she would not never talk about it.

83
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.440
And it's like, Oh, this is so appalling. Yeah. Well she's.

84
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.540
<v 1>There, she's under investigation right now. Definitely.</v>

85
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.850
<v 0>Definitely. Yeah. Um,</v>

86
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.730
apparently she had a brother who lived in the

87
00:05:26.731 --> 00:05:29.580
United States and the United Kingdom in London.

88
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.730
And according to her close friends that went on the record saying

89
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.740
that because her brother was gay.

90
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.960
So she decided to bring him to the us being

91
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.530
inside the, within the Somali community.

92
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.090
So maybe he'll get queued. This is the one who, uh,

93
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.880
who defends the LGBT community that she wants

94
00:05:56.881 --> 00:05:58.280
to cure her brother.

95
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.263
<v 1>By.</v>

96
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.430
<v 0>Being in this community.</v>

97
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.190
So he came by as a British citizen.

98
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.300
He cannot live here.

99
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.550
So basically they got married and

100
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.460
to give him, well, it's not like for any other reasons. I mean, it's, it's,

101
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.850
it's committing an immigration fraud and that's how he got his citizenship.

102
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.800
Um, she brought him to cure him and basically she used to say,

103
00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:32.360
according to her friends and to the people that went on the record saying that

104
00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:37.220
he's been around the wrong crowd in England.

105
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.240
So it's better for him to come here and be around us. Right.

106
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.860
<v 1>Okay. So putting aside the part about the gay brother and the curing,</v>

107
00:06:44.861 --> 00:06:46.480
which is bad enough in and of itself,

108
00:06:46.481 --> 00:06:49.060
especially by her own progressive ideals where she's supposed to,

109
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:50.680
it's supposed to be for gay people, but,

110
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.210
but that's not criminal in and of itself marrying your brother for the purposes

111
00:06:55.211 --> 00:06:58.390
of getting his immigration status is immigration fraud.

112
00:06:58.391 --> 00:07:00.040
And this is under investigation right now.

113
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.670
Do you think it's bizarre the way the mainstream media seems to be covering this

114
00:07:03.671 --> 00:07:06.700
up or is that just sort of congruent with everything else that.

115
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.140
<v 0>I think we got used to the mainstream media sadly,</v>

116
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:12.490
but we got used to it.

117
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.050
Have we ever heard anything about anybody about

118
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.200
progressive, about a Democrat? Yeah.

119
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.970
It's always about the us, the conservatives,

120
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.120
the Republicans, it's always about us.

121
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.550
What about all these candles that were around

122
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.240
a large percentage of the Democrats?

123
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.640
It's it, it goes under the radar and they would,

124
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:43.990
even if they mentioned it,

125
00:07:43.991 --> 00:07:48.580
they would mention it in and in times that are not very popular.

126
00:07:48.581 --> 00:07:51.050
So, um, and then that's it that's.

127
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:51.401
<v 1>Well,</v>

128
00:07:51.401 --> 00:07:55.450
instead of the New York times writes a piece about the new hip artist in town,

129
00:07:55.451 --> 00:07:58.770
Hunter Biden, you saw that one in the times, he,

130
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.920
the new hot artist in town, I'm pretty sure Donald Trump Jr.

131
00:08:02.921 --> 00:08:06.010
Wouldn't get the same, uh, coverage, New York times.

132
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:10.540
<v 0>Uh, no, not even, not Trump, not his kids,</v>

133
00:08:10.541 --> 00:08:12.580
not his children.

134
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.890
<v 1>Does it feel in a weird way? So for someone that,</v>

135
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.750
that was a journalist under a dictatorship, um, does that,

136
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:23.560
or came from a country that was a dictatorship does when you see the way our

137
00:08:23.561 --> 00:08:24.850
media behaves right now.

138
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:28.990
<v 0>Similar, similar, exactly,</v>

139
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.360
exactly similar. I mean, having, uh,

140
00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.160
uh, they always try to defend all the mainstream media.

141
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:42.700
They pretend to defend the first amendment,

142
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.560
but what they're doing is so, and tie the first amendment,

143
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.760
freedom of speech is the most important thing.

144
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:57.300
Uh, there are just doing,

145
00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.500
and I know it,

146
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:03.420
I know what the narrative of the Progressive's and it'll

147
00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:08.390
handle of Rashida, what they bring. I've seen the consequences of,

148
00:09:08.391 --> 00:09:09.600
of the hatred.

149
00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:13.980
I've seen the consequences of oppression and of division.

150
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.230
I run away from it and I was fighting it for 31

151
00:09:19.231 --> 00:09:21.840
years and I am,

152
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:26.670
as an American citizen would stand against it from NEF.

153
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.630
I was standing against it and I will until the day I die.

154
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:35.480
<v 1>Does anything about the machine that you're going up against scare you in any</v>

155
00:09:35.481 --> 00:09:38.300
way? Just, I mean, at the most human level, I mean,

156
00:09:38.301 --> 00:09:41.240
I know you've been through worse in a lot of ways, but it's a big.

157
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.700
<v 0>Huge machine. Uh,</v>

158
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:49.070
and especially when it comes to radical Muslims and to the Muslim brotherhood

159
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:53.270
and to the people behind the Muslim brotherhood faith. No,

160
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:57.860
if you hear, or if you read that I committed suicide,

161
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.860
I'm not suicidal. I'm very happy.

162
00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:05.780
So look for them because definitely I'm not a,

163
00:10:05.781 --> 00:10:08.480
we've seen suicides here and there, uh,

164
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.720
lately and the, uh,

165
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:16.670
the Muslim brotherhood is a terrorist group and the first thing would be

166
00:10:16.671 --> 00:10:20.270
my priority when I get elected in November,

167
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:25.130
that I will make sure the Muslim brotherhood would be

168
00:10:25.131 --> 00:10:29.900
designated as a terrorist group, such as several countries,

169
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.590
Egypt, that's where the Muslim brotherhood, uh,

170
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:37.310
was formed Egypt, consider it, uh, and,

171
00:10:37.311 --> 00:10:41.450
and other countries in the region consider it a terrorist group.

172
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:45.470
And we should, we should to, to, uh,

173
00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.280
I'm not scaring, not trying to scare people,

174
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.380
but we shouldn't be afraid of name calling things with their real names.

175
00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.360
And that's not Islamophobe,

176
00:10:56.390 --> 00:11:00.950
that's not anti anything that's being entitled and reserved an entire

177
00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.720
radicalism. And if I don't stand against it,

178
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.673
who else.

179
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.490
