1
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.220
<v 1>All right. People. It is November 30th, 2020,</v>

2
00:00:13.221 --> 00:00:16.640
we're almost into December. And I'm Dave Rubin.

3
00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:19.010
This is the Rubin report direct message.

4
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.150
It was a long weekend holiday weekend, Thanksgiving weekend.

5
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.010
I know that most of you probably committed several misdemeanors and felonies by

6
00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:30.020
getting together with family members,

7
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.240
perhaps crossing state lines may be even sharing the spoon

8
00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:36.860
of a buffet style meal.

9
00:00:36.861 --> 00:00:39.920
So I know a lot of you were probably on the run from the law right now.

10
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.600
You're probably in a car, you know, cops behind ya. They're hunting us down.

11
00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:45.680
They're coming for us.

12
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.360
These more chronic authoritarian draconian laws that these dingbats

13
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.320
have, uh, tried to crush us with, but I don't think they're going to win.

14
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.190
And in case he can't tell people I'm in a very good mood this morning.

15
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.660
I am completely refreshed. I needed a couple of days just to, just to eat,

16
00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:07.220
basically sleep, watch some TV and do pretty much nothing else.

17
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.610
And that's exactly what I did. We did a little gardening around here. We,

18
00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:14.930
we just ate a obscene amount of food.

19
00:01:14.931 --> 00:01:18.230
If you're not following me on, on Twitter or Instagram or whatever,

20
00:01:18.231 --> 00:01:20.630
you can see the type of stuff that we're cooking around here.

21
00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:22.880
And I think we're to work on a cookbook as well.

22
00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:26.330
We've sort of had an idea for it for, for quite some time. Um,

23
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.350
so you can check out on Instagram Rubin report and on Twitter, Rubin record,

24
00:01:30.351 --> 00:01:33.530
all that stuff. Uh, we did a little gardening. We watched airplanes.

25
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.350
David had never seen an airplane before we watched airplane.

26
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.200
And it's just like absolute perfection.

27
00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:42.740
I would say naked guns still to me is the funniest movie of all time.

28
00:01:42.741 --> 00:01:45.710
But we did watch a little airplane. That was great. And uh, Oh,

29
00:01:45.711 --> 00:01:47.930
and then we watched Mandalorian and I know, you know,

30
00:01:47.931 --> 00:01:50.390
I did a Q and a over the last week or so,

31
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.520
and I said that I wasn't loving Mandalorian.

32
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.100
It just didn't quite get me there yet. But finally,

33
00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:58.010
the last two episodes they're getting there and to see a soca there in the way

34
00:01:58.011 --> 00:02:02.750
they're linking the pre-calls with the originals and now in the new, well,

35
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.170
not the new universe, but the now universe, I guess you could say,

36
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.420
I thought that was pretty great too. So it was just,

37
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.160
I'm feeling good about life. I know the world is crazy. Uh, but uh, I think,

38
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.860
I think some good things are on the horizon.

39
00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:19.160
I think a lot of people are really misjudging what's happening in the world

40
00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:22.010
right now. And we're seeing a lot of people celebrate a little too early. Oh,

41
00:02:22.011 --> 00:02:23.240
and we're not even going to do this story,

42
00:02:23.241 --> 00:02:26.690
but I guess I should address the fact, Oh no, we are going to do this story.

43
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.650
I was about to, uh, to talk about Biden's foot, but we, we are,

44
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.660
we aren't doing Biden's foot. All right. So let's,

45
00:02:32.661 --> 00:02:37.210
let's talk about lockdown stupidity because here in Los Angeles, it,

46
00:02:37.211 --> 00:02:40.520
it continues to get worse and worse. One day,

47
00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:42.380
I'm just going to be doing the show from, you know,

48
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.870
literally just be a dark room. I will have nothing.

49
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.130
They'll just be a spotlight on me and nothing else. Uh, because these lockdowns,

50
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.370
they, they just continue. So we'll start off with a,

51
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.170
a quote from the Los Angeles department of health. And well,

52
00:02:57.171 --> 00:02:58.004
here we go.

53
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.100
As new COVID 19 cases remain at alarming levels and the number of people

54
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:07.990
hospitalized continues to increase a temporary Los Angeles County health

55
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:12.520
officer order will be issued to require additional safety

56
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:14.440
measures across sectors. Now,

57
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.100
before I get into the specifics of what they're asking us to do,

58
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:20.860
and I assure you, they're ridiculous, you're going to find out soon enough.

59
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.910
I just wanted to point out that as far as I know in the United States,

60
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:28.980
we don't have any hospitals that have been completely overrun.

61
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.810
We don't have any States that have been completely destroyed, Florida,

62
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.520
which has stayed open is not somehow a million times worse than

63
00:03:38.521 --> 00:03:41.040
California, which has stayed closed.

64
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.730
We don't see massive outbreaks in homeless camps, encampments.

65
00:03:44.731 --> 00:03:47.940
Now we got a lot of homeless encampments. I went to home Depot yesterday.

66
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.720
I had to drive under a bridge and there's literally now trolls under the bridges

67
00:03:51.721 --> 00:03:55.560
because they all live under the bridges now. And they have massive encampments.

68
00:03:55.561 --> 00:03:56.400
Obviously, no one,

69
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.840
they're not doing the things that would be best for personal hygiene and wearing

70
00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:04.530
masks and everything else. But we don't see massive outbreaks there. I passed,

71
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.680
I passed a, a, I pass two hospitals yesterday, actually.

72
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.790
And they're both pretty much empty. Now, again, this isn't to say that COVID,

73
00:04:11.791 --> 00:04:13.170
isn't real and we know it's real.

74
00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:16.380
And we know that 99% of people roughly survive it.

75
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.630
And we know we've got vaccines coming out and everything else.

76
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.240
And whether they're rushing out the vaccines and whether you should take the

77
00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:22.350
vaccine as a separate issue.

78
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.630
But the point is that these insane measures are just destroying people

79
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.120
lives and doing nothing else. And I look forward,

80
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.400
I predicted this on Twitter a couple weeks ago,

81
00:04:32.401 --> 00:04:36.420
but I really believe that 2021 is going to be the year of the lawsuit.

82
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.800
P there are going to be so many class action lawsuit suits and,

83
00:04:39.801 --> 00:04:44.730
and personal lawsuits going after the crash politicians who

84
00:04:44.731 --> 00:04:49.500
manipulated science and did all sorts of things that they constitutionally are

85
00:04:49.501 --> 00:04:50.670
not allowed to do. Uh,

86
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.180
but let's break down some of the numbers and some of the specific things that

87
00:04:54.181 --> 00:04:57.720
you're allowed to do here, Los Angeles, let's throw it up.

88
00:04:57.721 --> 00:04:58.680
This is very exciting.

89
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.690
Essential retail can be at 35% maximum occupancy.

90
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.470
Now I don't know what essential retail is. I mean, I guess if you need sneakers,

91
00:05:07.471 --> 00:05:09.270
that would be essential, but like,

92
00:05:09.271 --> 00:05:13.440
is buying like a hoodie not essential or like, what is essential retail?

93
00:05:13.441 --> 00:05:15.650
They don't, they never tell you it doesn't matter, but okay.

94
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.180
35% now where'd they come up with that number? Now,

95
00:05:18.181 --> 00:05:21.300
this is what I'm saying about how none of this is based in science,

96
00:05:21.301 --> 00:05:23.940
like 35% at essential retail.

97
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.110
That sounds like something like they put some thought into it, but why not? 40%?

98
00:05:28.111 --> 00:05:32.760
Why not? 45%? I don't know. Non-essential retail, whatever that is.

99
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.210
Non-essential retail. So is that a video game store? Uh,

100
00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:40.410
so that would be at 20% maximum occupancy. All right.

101
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.410
You know, sounds sorta whatever, uh,

102
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.320
includes indoor malls at 20%. I mean,

103
00:05:46.321 --> 00:05:48.090
most indoor mall has been failing for a long time.

104
00:05:48.091 --> 00:05:52.260
They're usually at 10% occupancy if you've been to a mall lately. So 20%,

105
00:05:52.261 --> 00:05:55.770
they'd be thrilled to have that personal care services at, uh,

106
00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.260
can be at 20% maximum, maximum occupancy. So personal care,

107
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:03.620
I assume that's like getting your nails done, getting your toe toenails done,

108
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:06.290
maybe getting your haircut. So, okay. 20%.

109
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.530
And I'm sure those businesses will really thrive, right?

110
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.660
Like those people who own those small businesses,

111
00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:15.620
that's going to really thrive when only one out of five of your little chairs at

112
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:19.610
your, at your nail salon or your foot specialist place. When that, uh,

113
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.570
when those chairs are, uh, all open, four out of five are open.

114
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.490
Libraries can be at 20% maximum occupancy,

115
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.540
okay. That not ever. I mean, again, these numbers they do.

116
00:06:31.541 --> 00:06:32.810
They just make up these numbers.

117
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.430
Fitness centers operating indoors can be at 50%, uh, sorry.

118
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.550
Outdoors can be at 50% maximum occupancy.

119
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.290
Now remember most fitness places, most gyms your gym. Think about your gym.

120
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.640
Do they have an outdoor area? The gym that I used to go to, I,

121
00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:51.890
I went to Equinox. I canceled it, but they had no outdoor area.

122
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.960
And now it just sits there. Absolutely empty, good, young, healthy,

123
00:06:56.961 --> 00:07:00.620
vibrant people could be going to the gym indoors.

124
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.870
They could be taking their temperature outside.

125
00:07:02.871 --> 00:07:05.540
They could be washing things off and sterilizing things,

126
00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:08.810
but instead they've decided to destroy businesses.

127
00:07:08.811 --> 00:07:13.250
Like most gyms don't have a just outdoor area for you to run around and play in.

128
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:15.920
<v 2>Museums, galleries.</v>

129
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.280
<v 1>Zoos, and aquariums can be at 50% occupancy.</v>

130
00:07:19.281 --> 00:07:22.100
So what are they going to do with all the penguins? Okay. What are you going to,

131
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.660
you're going to slaughter half the penguins.

132
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.570
Is that what we're is that what we're doing now? I mean, really? It's this,

133
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.110
we're gonna have a big penguin roast at this point. 50% capacity.

134
00:07:30.111 --> 00:07:34.850
I mean that again, it just makes no sense. Museums, galleries, zoos,

135
00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:39.080
and aquariums. Let's try this. Museums, museums usually indoors,

136
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.950
mostly endorsed. Sometimes they have a little outdoor area to museum galleries,

137
00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:47.690
usually indoors. Okay. Fine. Zoos outdoors. Right?

138
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.640
I've been to the LA zoo here in LA. Many times I've been to Safari park, uh,

139
00:07:52.641 --> 00:07:55.910
which is the, uh, the San Diego zoo. They've got the whole Safari.

140
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.130
You're in a big Safari. It's outdoors.

141
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:03.350
Can you be there aquariums outdoors? For the most part, I know the lizards,

142
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.880
you know, they keep the lizards two doors.

143
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:06.560
The point is none of this makes sense.

144
00:08:06.561 --> 00:08:10.910
Why would a museum that's indoors be at 50% capacity and an aquarium?

145
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:15.890
You see the point a and then here's my favorite mini golf batting

146
00:08:15.891 --> 00:08:18.080
cages. Go-kart racing,

147
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.680
operating outdoors can all be at 50%. So

148
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.540
Schiller,

149
00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:28.100
we've wrecked the livelihoods of restaurant tours and all sorts of people who

150
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.790
opened little shops and whatever they wanted to do with their lives.

151
00:08:31.791 --> 00:08:36.020
But we're going to keep the go-cart thing going at 50%, you know,

152
00:08:36.021 --> 00:08:38.720
just 50 freaking percent, uh, by the way,

153
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.780
this is all colored by the fact that right now,

154
00:08:41.781 --> 00:08:46.310
they also are telling us that you can't have anyone else in your home.

155
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.940
That's right. You are supposed to until December 20th.

156
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.700
So this is three weeks basically. And then by the way,

157
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.380
they'll roll that right into Christmas. I mean,

158
00:08:54.381 --> 00:08:57.210
they tried to Thanksgiving and now they want to destroy Christmas.

159
00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.050
These people are evil. Do you get it yet? Uh,

160
00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.630
but they wasn't nobody in your house. So I just want to be very clear.

161
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.510
They were about something because you guys know I'm a radical freedom.

162
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:08.990
Extremist. I'm breaking the laws right now. Michael,

163
00:09:08.991 --> 00:09:13.100
will you please wave to the camera? Okay. That's one hand Connor, will you wait,

164
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.020
you see what's happening here?

165
00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:18.410
People I've got floating hands in this room with me. The room is,

166
00:09:18.411 --> 00:09:22.820
I'd say maybe 10 by 10. There's at least two, their hands in here. Okay.

167
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.170
At least what are you going to come and get me? Garcia? You like, Oh,

168
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:30.110
screw you people really. They're just awful.

169
00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:34.100
But if you want to know how awful they are, I'd say, uh, Gavin Newsome, who is,

170
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.200
is our ridiculous governor here in California.

171
00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:39.440
He hit peak Gavin Newsome awfulness,

172
00:09:39.441 --> 00:09:43.880
and then Kamala Harris and went into peak Kamala awfulness because they put out

173
00:09:43.881 --> 00:09:47.150
these insane tweets over the weekend, uh,

174
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.630
because they were talking about small business Saturday.

175
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:53.180
And here's the tweet from Gavin Newsome. I mean,

176
00:09:53.181 --> 00:09:57.680
this is just incredible quote. Today is small business.

177
00:09:57.681 --> 00:10:02.420
Saturday, California is home to over 4 million small businesses.

178
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:07.610
This holiday season shop safe and shop local to help support

179
00:10:07.611 --> 00:10:12.020
our account economy and the over 7 million workers that help keep our small

180
00:10:12.021 --> 00:10:13.400
businesses going. Okay.

181
00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:18.680
Do you understand that Gavin Newsome

182
00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.460
is the one who has closed all of the small businesses.

183
00:10:22.461 --> 00:10:25.820
He has closed all of the small shops,

184
00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.340
all of the small restaurants, all of these things.

185
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:32.900
And then he's also telling us that we should shop there while he's got these

186
00:10:32.901 --> 00:10:37.880
people with their restaurants closed and boarded up the height of

187
00:10:37.881 --> 00:10:41.960
hypocrisy. This, this guy is going to French laundry. The most,

188
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:44.720
one of the most expensive restaurants in the entire country.

189
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:48.470
I did this story last week. He was with 22 people. They were indoors.

190
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:49.730
They didn't have masks.

191
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:54.740
They spent $15,000 on booze,

192
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.810
$15,000 on booze.

193
00:10:56.811 --> 00:11:00.710
That's about 750 bucks a person on booze.

194
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:05.330
And he has the goal as they shut down and destroy lives,

195
00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:08.540
destroy your lives. They have the gall to tell you, Oh,

196
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.340
it also shop at the small businesses. Only.

197
00:11:10.341 --> 00:11:13.430
The only thing is we closed all the small businesses right now.

198
00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:18.170
Literally I can go about two miles away and go to target. Target is open.

199
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.960
But if you were to go to just the little store,

200
00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.720
just the little store that I'd have some of the things that you might get at

201
00:11:23.721 --> 00:11:28.100
target, say some, uh, holiday wrapping paper, some gifts,

202
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.340
trinkets, whatever it is, those stores are closed. And this,

203
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:35.180
this numb nut dingbat has the gall to say this,

204
00:11:35.181 --> 00:11:38.600
but then the, uh, the presumed president delay.

205
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.310
And we'll get to the next story in a second.

206
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.940
Cause I think she's thinks she's going to be president. Uh, this is from, uh,

207
00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:47.390
Kamala. She said, small businesses need our support.

208
00:11:47.391 --> 00:11:51.470
Now more than ever before this small business, Saturday throughout the holidays,

209
00:11:51.471 --> 00:11:55.000
please shop local and do your part to the backbone of our communities and our

210
00:11:55.001 --> 00:11:56.290
economy. Again,

211
00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:00.030
Democrats are the one one's destroying all of these businesses.

212
00:12:00.031 --> 00:12:04.410
These people are, these people are liars and frauds.

213
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:09.240
They are not good people. If you don't see it yet, I, I, if I could smack you,

214
00:12:09.241 --> 00:12:12.090
I don't know that we have the technology yet through the YouTube,

215
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.690
but I would just whack you just not a, not a full on bam, but just like,

216
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:21.300
you know, like you, you wake up already. These, these are not good people.

217
00:12:21.301 --> 00:12:22.950
They must be voted out and they have,

218
00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:27.540
they should have no authority to run anyone's life. And, and by the way,

219
00:12:27.541 --> 00:12:29.640
I'm just not listening to any of their edicts.

220
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.130
Like I'm going to have people here. Look, look, I got a floating hand,

221
00:12:32.131 --> 00:12:34.110
watch this floating in there's one floating hand.

222
00:12:34.111 --> 00:12:37.110
Can I get another floating hand? Look at this. I got floating hands, like,

223
00:12:37.111 --> 00:12:40.470
come and get me Garcetti, really come and get me. Let's see what happens, man.

224
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.880
Ugh, gross losers. Uh, but it's not just California.

225
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:49.710
That's completely insane. Vermont is actually, uh,

226
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:54.090
potentially equally as insane because now they've got school children

227
00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.460
ratting out their parents. Yeah.

228
00:12:56.461 --> 00:13:01.320
They literally want children to tell their teachers and administrators

229
00:13:01.321 --> 00:13:05.580
at public schools. What the nature of their Thanksgiving holidays, where,

230
00:13:05.581 --> 00:13:08.430
I mean, this is absolutely insane. This is, this is a story from the blaze.

231
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:13.200
The state of Vermont has announced that school children and their parents will

232
00:13:13.201 --> 00:13:17.370
be questioned about the nature of their Thanksgiving gatherings.

233
00:13:17.371 --> 00:13:22.080
After the kids returned to school and children and families that admit

234
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:26.670
to violating the state's rules against celebrating with another household will

235
00:13:26.671 --> 00:13:26.940
be.

236
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:30.360
<v 3>We're required to quarantine at home.</v>

237
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:35.340
<v 1>Do you see why we have a problem here?</v>

238
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:40.110
People we are telling children that they should

239
00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:42.330
rat out on their family members.

240
00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:47.790
Did you little Johnny celebrate Thanksgiving with grandma? Sure.

241
00:13:47.791 --> 00:13:51.360
She only has a couple of years to live and maybe she didn't want to spend her

242
00:13:51.361 --> 00:13:54.900
last years alone in a dark room during Thanksgiving.

243
00:13:54.901 --> 00:13:57.720
She wanted to take the risk and be there with her family.

244
00:13:57.721 --> 00:14:00.540
And you could have socially distanced or done whatever else you want to rambly,

245
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:05.070
but we're the government and you better do what we say. God, it's insane.

246
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:09.720
I mean, kids ratting out parents. That's what they want.

247
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.750
That's what they want. And by the way, because, uh, you know,

248
00:14:12.751 --> 00:14:14.400
obviously I hit the Democrats on this a lot.

249
00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:18.300
The governor of Vermont is a Republican. His name is Phil Scott.

250
00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:22.110
And he's the one that ordered the Vermont agency of education to execute this.

251
00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:27.090
So most of these draconian laws, most of these ridiculous rat on your neighbor,

252
00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.350
we're locking you down.

253
00:14:28.351 --> 00:14:31.410
We're destroying small businesses while telling you to go to small businesses.

254
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:35.400
Most of it's coming out of Democrats, but Phil Scott, you're the, uh,

255
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:38.790
you're the prime I'm trying to, you know,

256
00:14:38.791 --> 00:14:41.070
I've been saying that F bomb a lot of them on the show lately,

257
00:14:41.071 --> 00:14:44.760
because I've been doing these special messages and I know you guys enjoy them.

258
00:14:44.761 --> 00:14:48.090
I did a special messaged with my newsman glasses.

259
00:14:48.091 --> 00:14:51.120
I did a special message to, uh, to Gavin Newsome.

260
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.840
I think I did to build a Blasio. And a lot of people are enjoying them. And the,

261
00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:56.750
and the, you know, they get, they pick up some steam,

262
00:14:56.751 --> 00:15:01.070
but I was trying to be nice there to Phil, to Phil Scott. Wasn't that,

263
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.350
what's his name in the office. That was Michael Scott.

264
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.960
But you see the same difference people. Anyway,

265
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:08.720
I have the glasses here and I'm thinking about doing one today, but I'm not,

266
00:15:08.721 --> 00:15:11.390
I'm not sure yet. Cause I'm trying not to curse too much,

267
00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:15.380
but really like the idea of children ratting on their parents.

268
00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:19.460
Like how far are we from that to show me your papers, right? Like world war II,

269
00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.390
Nazis people just walking down the street, show me your papers over.

270
00:15:22.391 --> 00:15:26.930
We're going to take you away. It's just, it's just crazy. Um, all right, well,

271
00:15:26.931 --> 00:15:28.220
speaking of crazy,

272
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:32.420
there's a 78 year old man who is the presumed president elect,

273
00:15:32.421 --> 00:15:35.120
although I'm pretty sure it ain't gonna happen, but we'll see about that.

274
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.610
There's a lot of stuff going on there that the mainstream's not,

275
00:15:37.611 --> 00:15:41.090
not talking about, not, not to talking about and they're not talking about it.

276
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:45.680
Um, but we got this 78 year old guy with dementia. And then on Saturday,

277
00:15:45.681 --> 00:15:50.270
apparently he broke his foot. He fractured his foot while playing with his dog.

278
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.650
Now, normally, uh,

279
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.770
you would think a 78 year old man with a broken foot in dementia.

280
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.570
Maybe he shouldn't be the leader of the free world,

281
00:15:56.571 --> 00:16:00.650
but let's put that aside for a sec. Uh, here's ABC news.

282
00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:04.040
They said after initial x-rays were reassuring,

283
00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:09.200
a follow-up CT scan showed that president elect Joe Biden has hairline

284
00:16:09.201 --> 00:16:12.380
fractures in his foot following a fall. This weekend,

285
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:17.330
his doctor said Biden will likely need to wear a walking boot for several weeks.

286
00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.750
You know, the boot, you know that boot, you see these people with the boot.

287
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:24.080
I don't know. I laugh every time I see the boot, something about that.

288
00:16:24.081 --> 00:16:28.430
Boot just seems very funny to me, but okay, it's already started with Joe Biden.

289
00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:33.320
It's like this, man. If, if, if he is sworn in on January 20th, which again,

290
00:16:33.321 --> 00:16:35.210
I'm still not convinced is going to happen.

291
00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:37.790
But if he is sworn in on January 20th,

292
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.230
the idea that he is going to be president for four years,

293
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.580
until he's 82 years old, he obviously has the beginnings of dementia.

294
00:16:43.581 --> 00:16:47.900
He now has a broken foot and he's going to be in a boot and a broken foot.

295
00:16:47.901 --> 00:16:50.690
You know what happens after the broken foot people? It's the broken hip.

296
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:54.500
And you know what happens to elderly people once they break the hip, okay?

297
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:59.210
We all know what this thing looks like. Like this is just the,

298
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:02.480
I don't know if they pushed them. I'm not, you know,

299
00:17:02.481 --> 00:17:03.800
I'm not saying any of that happened.

300
00:17:03.801 --> 00:17:06.470
Let's just say he tripped over the dog or something happened with the dog,

301
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:11.450
but this guy is not ready, is not, it's not ready. That's not the right word.

302
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:15.260
He is not fit to be president of the United States. And this is just a,

303
00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.470
her in a way you think his team has got to be thrilled right now.

304
00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:19.071
Cause they're like, Oh,

305
00:17:19.071 --> 00:17:21.800
now we have the perfect excuse to never get them out there. Right.

306
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:24.800
We never have to get them out because we don't want them to be seen in the boot

307
00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.530
limping like, like a lame dog. Right?

308
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:32.690
So instead we're just gonna hide him and we'll let Kamala do all the

309
00:17:32.691 --> 00:17:36.890
talking. And man, she, you know, she is licking her chops,

310
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:41.360
just waiting for that 25th amendment to be called out and go,

311
00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:45.710
I'm taken over. But I assure you people, if Biden is sworn in on January,

312
00:17:45.711 --> 00:17:48.980
you know what, here we go. I'm going to make a bold statement. Michael,

313
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:51.690
coming to make a bold statement today. Bold statement. Here we go.

314
00:17:51.691 --> 00:17:55.140
If Joe Biden is sworn in on

315
00:17:55.141 --> 00:17:57.660
January 20th, 2021,

316
00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:02.400
and he completes a four year term actually completes a four-year term.

317
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:06.960
I will retire. I will retire at the end of that term. That will be it.

318
00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:09.450
I will disappear in just over four years,

319
00:18:09.451 --> 00:18:11.940
four years in about a month and a half. And that'll be it.

320
00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:16.080
That's how convinced I will just disappear from public life altogether.

321
00:18:16.081 --> 00:18:19.830
I will delete all of my accounts and then you'll never hear from me again.

322
00:18:19.831 --> 00:18:22.560
That's how convinced I am, that it ain't going to happen.

323
00:18:22.561 --> 00:18:24.720
He will not be president for four years.

324
00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:29.070
He either won't be president at all because of the election fraud and all that

325
00:18:29.071 --> 00:18:32.100
kind of stuff. Um, which by the way, is gaining momentum.

326
00:18:32.101 --> 00:18:33.690
We're not even really covering it that much today,

327
00:18:33.691 --> 00:18:35.220
but it is actually gaining momentum.

328
00:18:35.221 --> 00:18:37.440
And Giuliani was at a hearing in Arizona today.

329
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.910
They found some really bizarre stuff with these mid, you know, these late night,

330
00:18:41.911 --> 00:18:46.080
1:00 AM to 6:00 AM vote dumps. I think in Pennsylvania, ran,

331
00:18:46.081 --> 00:18:48.420
Paul was tweeting about it this morning. I mean,

332
00:18:48.421 --> 00:18:49.650
there's just some stuff going on,

333
00:18:49.651 --> 00:18:52.980
but I do not think that one way or another Joe Biden will not be president for

334
00:18:52.981 --> 00:18:55.830
four years anyway. So he's got a broken foot on top of everything else.

335
00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:59.370
And then I saw this clip this weekend, you know,

336
00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:01.560
I try not to tweet on the weekends, but then, you know,

337
00:19:01.561 --> 00:19:04.020
sometimes I accidentally get on there literally accidentally,

338
00:19:04.021 --> 00:19:06.660
like you just open up my phone and my finger just goes through it. And I'm like,

339
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:09.870
ah, I'm in there. Um, or sometimes people send me some things,

340
00:19:09.871 --> 00:19:14.790
but I thought this was just spectacular because this is four years ago basically

341
00:19:14.791 --> 00:19:15.624
to the day.

342
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:20.520
This is right after Donald Trump was elected president and the Russians were

343
00:19:20.521 --> 00:19:25.140
involved in the whole thing and it was very bad. Uh, and he was on Chris Hayes,

344
00:19:25.141 --> 00:19:28.050
his show on MSNBC. And at first, when you see this clip,

345
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:29.970
Chris Hayes to me is a five-year-old,

346
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:34.290
who's dressed up like an adult with his fancy glasses to look like he's an

347
00:19:34.291 --> 00:19:36.780
important person who knows what he's talking about. Uh,

348
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:41.250
but they talk about the wonderful ways that they could

349
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.910
overthrow the election of Donald Trump.

350
00:19:44.911 --> 00:19:48.630
And I thought it would be worth showing you too when these people show when they

351
00:19:48.631 --> 00:19:51.990
now tell you, Oh no, no, no, no, there's nothing we can do.

352
00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:54.030
And you must obey the results of the election,

353
00:19:54.031 --> 00:19:56.550
but they were singing a different tune four years ago.

354
00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.580
Here's the clip from Ms and BZ.

355
00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:03.140
<v 4>I think there are people who are pushing very hard and think that, um,</v>

356
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:07.010
because of some of the constitutional perils of the emoluments clause, uh,

357
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.910
because of the popular vote margin, because of, um, uh, fundamentals,

358
00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.460
they think threat to liberal democracy that the,

359
00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.600
that electors should be persuaded and pressured on Monday to,

360
00:20:16.601 --> 00:20:20.120
to part with what their pledges and vote and vote against Donald Trump. Yes,

361
00:20:20.121 --> 00:20:21.710
they absolutely should do that. Absolutely.

362
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:24.050
I believe right now that there are electors,

363
00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:28.670
but only 38 of them who have a conscience or who are worried about a man who

364
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:31.280
won't attend the daily security briefings who, uh,

365
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:35.960
who we now know Russia was trying to help get elected. I mean,

366
00:20:35.961 --> 00:20:38.630
can you imagine that this is if you are, I had been running for office and they,

367
00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.740
they showed that the Iranians were somehow involved in helping you or me get

368
00:20:42.741 --> 00:20:47.560
elected. What would happen to you or me, Chris? I'm just curious what happen.

369
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:52.840
<v 1>It would be a totally all right. People I'm as serious as those two,</v>

370
00:20:52.841 --> 00:20:54.550
I've got thick, grim glasses on.

371
00:20:54.551 --> 00:20:59.440
So you know what I'm about to say has a lot of weight. Okay. Um, yeah. What is,

372
00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.310
what is Michael Moore? Michael Moore, uh, go to the gym,

373
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:08.200
take a couple of days off bread for God's sakes. Um, he says, uh,

374
00:21:08.201 --> 00:21:12.100
electors with a conscience that they're the ones that are supposed to flip the

375
00:21:12.101 --> 00:21:12.880
election.

376
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.500
And he obviously got help from the Russians God,

377
00:21:17.501 --> 00:21:22.270
these people are absolutely patently absurd, patently,

378
00:21:22.271 --> 00:21:22.750
absurd,

379
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:26.800
everything they said four years ago is now the reverse of what they're saying.

380
00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:27.510
Yeah.

381
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:32.100
And that again is why you really shouldn't be for a team in and of itself,

382
00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:34.170
because then you're just going to flip constantly.

383
00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:38.580
You should try to have some basic set of principles that you can apply and then

384
00:21:38.581 --> 00:21:41.880
you go, Oh, well maybe I want to scale back power.

385
00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:43.620
This is what I tell you guys all the time. Right?

386
00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.630
And I'm a guy with thick rim glasses. So, you know,

387
00:21:45.631 --> 00:21:46.590
I know what I'm talking about.

388
00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:51.420
What you want to do in a healthy society is scale back the power so that when

389
00:21:51.421 --> 00:21:56.100
the guy who's the real bad guy gets in, he can't do that much bad.

390
00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.580
And when the guy who you like your good guy, right?

391
00:21:59.581 --> 00:22:02.640
Your hero when he gets in the trade off is he can't do everything you want.

392
00:22:02.641 --> 00:22:07.260
And that allows us to have that healthy tension between conservative and

393
00:22:07.261 --> 00:22:11.850
liberal and left, right. And red, blue Democrat, Republican, and the rest of it.

394
00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.930
Um, I'll take the glasses off for the rest of this. Anyway,

395
00:22:15.931 --> 00:22:17.160
I thought it was worth, uh,

396
00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:20.670
it was worth showing you guys that there is just such a series of,

397
00:22:20.671 --> 00:22:24.900
of stupid things happening. Um, but that's what we're here for.

398
00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:25.860
That's what we're here for it, by the way,

399
00:22:25.861 --> 00:22:28.710
I wasn't even going to do a show today, uh, because we just, uh,

400
00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.950
we hired our new director Connor and he's here in person for the first time.

401
00:22:31.951 --> 00:22:33.330
So I know over the last couple of weeks,

402
00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.130
we've had a couple of little technical glitches.

403
00:22:35.131 --> 00:22:37.110
We've been doing a lot of stuff on the fly and everything else,

404
00:22:37.111 --> 00:22:42.000
but we've now got our full team here in Los Angeles. And, uh,

405
00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.620
you know what, let's just show them the floating hands.

406
00:22:43.621 --> 00:22:47.190
One more time just to prove I'm here with human beings. Okay.

407
00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:50.460
I know I'm going to, I'm going to I'm racking up fines left and right over here,

408
00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:53.580
real people in this room, we're all going to be okay.

409
00:22:53.581 --> 00:22:57.090
We're making decisions for ourselves.

410
00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.790
I think we're going to go out further because they were going to go out for

411
00:22:59.791 --> 00:23:02.550
lunch. We can't go out for lunch. We're going to sit outside for lunch.

412
00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:05.400
That's what we're gonna do today. Uh, all right guys, uh, we're,

413
00:23:05.401 --> 00:23:08.400
we're back five days a week. This week originally, as I said,

414
00:23:08.401 --> 00:23:10.470
I was going to only plan to do this show three days a week,

415
00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:15.600
but the world just won't let me have a day. Uh, by the way, we posted a part,

416
00:23:15.601 --> 00:23:19.680
one of my new interview with Douglas Murray Douglas is basically

417
00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:25.050
the clearest thinker around, uh, highly recommend you watch it.

418
00:23:25.051 --> 00:23:28.800
I got his take on everything happening in America. He was in America,

419
00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:32.100
actually stayed with us for a couple of days, uh, here at the house,

420
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:35.070
but he was in America where he, he went to Trump rallies.

421
00:23:35.071 --> 00:23:39.630
He traveled with Antifa. He was at, uh, some of the election stuff and got,

422
00:23:39.631 --> 00:23:43.050
you know, as someone from the UK got just like an insider's view of America.

423
00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:44.640
So we talk about that. Uh,

424
00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:49.490
he also opines on this story that you probably heard about a penguin random

425
00:23:49.491 --> 00:23:51.500
house, which is my publishing company, by the way,

426
00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:53.540
there they're the people that publish don't burn this book,

427
00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.780
the Canadian imprint, uh, they were,

428
00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:00.440
they were having all sorts of problems because Jordan Peterson's new book is

429
00:24:00.441 --> 00:24:01.550
coming out. And some of the,

430
00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:04.970
some of the children who work there were very upset and they were crying because

431
00:24:04.971 --> 00:24:06.650
Jordan's a white supremacist and the rest of it,

432
00:24:06.651 --> 00:24:11.120
which of course is the reverse of truth. And it shouldn't matter, uh, whether,

433
00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:12.980
whether an author is controversial or not,

434
00:24:12.981 --> 00:24:15.530
because it's about how many books can this person sell and everything else.

435
00:24:15.531 --> 00:24:17.930
So we get his feelings on that and much more.

436
00:24:17.931 --> 00:24:20.360
So clip one is up and then the rest will be out throughout the week.

437
00:24:20.361 --> 00:24:24.680
And of course the full episode is up on Rubin report.com already. Uh,

438
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:27.650
don't forget to subscribe to the channel here. We've got a busy day.

439
00:24:27.651 --> 00:24:30.020
Hope you're good. And, and I just,

440
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.110
one last thing I think everything's going to be okay.

441
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:37.130
I can't really explain why, but I, I sent something good this week.

442
00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:40.220
Today's Monday, by the time I do this show on Friday,

443
00:24:40.221 --> 00:24:42.500
I think we're going to have some good news people.

444
00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:45.830
That's the Dave Rubin prediction. I've never been wrong before,

445
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:48.800
so we'll see what happens. All right. That's it.

446
00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:49.960
<v 0>See you tomorrow.</v>
