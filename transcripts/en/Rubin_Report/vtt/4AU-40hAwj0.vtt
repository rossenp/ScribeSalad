1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.880
<v 0>Well remember that we have 20, um,</v>

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.860
conversion therapy laws that prohibit them from doing anything other than

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.800
affirming, because that might be considered, you know,

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.610
the so-called conversion therapy might be trying to convert them out of being

5
00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:17.790
trans. Now, in essence, they could lose their license,

6
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.480
they could lose their license. Um, now of course, conversion therapy,

7
00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:23.580
the reason we pass these bands was to,

8
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.650
it was to eliminate the really ugly practices of gay conversion

9
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:30.480
therapy. That's how they got past,

10
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.870
but they inserted activists inserted gender identity language.

11
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.900
So now a therapist can't even say to a child, hold on.

12
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:38.280
I know you say you're a boy,

13
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.460
but let's explore some of the other things that seem to be upsetting you.

14
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.600
<v 1>Are you worried that the slippery slope of this ultimately is that, you know,</v>

15
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.340
a child will, uh, a girl,

16
00:00:55.341 --> 00:00:58.340
young girl will basically announced that she's trans at school,

17
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.430
a parent or the parents will say, well,

18
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.670
we're not transitioning to something like that. And then as the state grows,

19
00:01:04.671 --> 00:01:04.971
and again,

20
00:01:04.971 --> 00:01:09.080
we're both in California that literally the state will start taking kids away

21
00:01:09.081 --> 00:01:11.030
from their parents. Like, is that something that,

22
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.350
that you think is really legit.

23
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.110
<v 0>It's already happening? I mean,</v>

24
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.260
you especially hear that now we're where with divorce,

25
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.220
divorce couples where they're not on the same page D I I've had,

26
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.250
I've been called by a mother who was, you know, she was divorced,

27
00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:29.510
but she had full custody of the daughter because the court deemed her the more

28
00:01:29.511 --> 00:01:34.250
responsible, better parent. And when the daughter hit 13 out of nowhere,

29
00:01:34.251 --> 00:01:37.940
she decided she was trans with the encouragement of her therapist and,

30
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.840
and her step-mom. And the moment the mom said,

31
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.920
the mom put the brakes on it and said, honey, you don't look. You know? And,

32
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.330
and the mom was not gender conforming herself. The mom said, honey, look,

33
00:01:50.331 --> 00:01:52.820
you're, you're still a girl just because you'll, you know,

34
00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:57.770
you don't want to dress girly. That's fine. Um, then, then the,

35
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.490
um, a social worker was brought in and decided that, um,

36
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.410
the mom was no longer a safe parent.

37
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.630
<v 1>God. I mean, it's just, it's, it's, it's twisted. It's deeply twisted.</v>

38
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.320
What about on the parent's side where we've seen some stories like this,

39
00:02:12.321 --> 00:02:14.450
I can think of one from about two months ago.

40
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.720
We're really seems to be the parent that's driving this,

41
00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:19.640
that the stuff we talked about earlier about, Oh,

42
00:02:19.641 --> 00:02:23.240
you suddenly are getting a lot of likes on tumbler or you're feeling like you're

43
00:02:23.241 --> 00:02:26.480
in a group suddenly that we've heard some instances where it seems like the

44
00:02:26.481 --> 00:02:29.780
parents are the ones driving their children towards this,

45
00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:33.890
because then they sort of by proxy feel popular or liked, or,

46
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.780
or as an oppressed screw, they're,

47
00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:38.450
they're an oppressed group adjacent or something.

48
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.750
<v 0>Right. So I think that does happen. Um,</v>

49
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.690
the population I really looked at is the biggest population.

50
00:02:44.691 --> 00:02:49.550
It's this teen girl population and the, and, and there, you don't, you know,

51
00:02:49.551 --> 00:02:52.580
these are young women who aren't listening to mom at all. In fact,

52
00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:57.230
the last thing they want is advice from mom. And so usually in that instance,

53
00:02:57.231 --> 00:03:00.940
the parents aren't so much the driver sometimes with the little kids,

54
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.250
you do see parents who they, you know,

55
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:07.030
who seem to be pushing this awfully hard and certain certainly seem to be

56
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:10.690
bragging about it online in ways that make you wonder if they aren't getting

57
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:11.710
something else out of it.

58
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.210
<v 1>Yeah. All right. The shrinks are up next.</v>

59
00:03:15.211 --> 00:03:18.600
I know that you're not thrilled with the way therapists have dealt with it.

60
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.060
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, they have an affirmative model right now, the majority,</v>

61
00:03:24.061 --> 00:03:24.990
although I interviewed, look,

62
00:03:24.991 --> 00:03:28.710
I interviewed a lot of giants in the field who don't agree with it and are not

63
00:03:28.711 --> 00:03:29.760
affirmative therapist,

64
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.300
but affirmative therapy says we start from the conclusion.

65
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.840
We know that we're going to agree with that,

66
00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:38.370
that a young person who says they're gender dysphoric,

67
00:03:38.371 --> 00:03:40.440
we're going to agree that that's the right diagnosis.

68
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.180
We'll affirm them as transgender.

69
00:03:42.181 --> 00:03:46.470
And the only question is when do we get started on the medications? And, um,

70
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.540
you know, that's, that's just not medicine.

71
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.630
Medicine is an evaluation of risks and benefits.

72
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.220
And the moment you are open about the risks and benefits of any medical

73
00:03:56.221 --> 00:04:00.330
treatment, you're, you're not in the gender affirmative camp anymore. You're,

74
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.200
you're on my side of things, which is to have an open look and,

75
00:04:04.201 --> 00:04:06.180
and approach with some skepticism,

76
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.660
how these girls are and whether they're benefiting.

77
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.340
<v 1>Do you sense that the,</v>

78
00:04:11.341 --> 00:04:15.090
that some of the psychologist or the psychiatrist that they're actually not

79
00:04:15.091 --> 00:04:17.070
telling these young girls, the,

80
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.360
what the numbers are in terms of either regretting it later in life or that it's

81
00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:26.340
not going to solve all of your problems or, or that suicides are still high?

82
00:04:26.341 --> 00:04:28.770
I mean, all of these things that are uncomfortable to talk about, I mean,

83
00:04:28.771 --> 00:04:32.640
do you sense that they kind of hide that because they're, they're just on board?

84
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.120
<v 0>Well, remember that we have 20, um,</v>

85
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.100
conversion therapy laws that prohibit them from doing anything other than

86
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.040
affirming, because that might be considered, you know,

87
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.880
the so-called conversion therapy might be trying to convert them out of being

88
00:04:47.881 --> 00:04:51.030
trans. Now in essence, they can lose their license,

89
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.720
they could lose their license. Um, now of course, conversion therapy,

90
00:04:54.721 --> 00:04:56.820
the reason we pass these bands was to,

91
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.890
it was to eliminate the really ugly practices of gay conversion

92
00:05:01.891 --> 00:05:03.720
therapy. That's how they got past,

93
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.110
but they inserted activists inserted gender identity language.

94
00:05:07.111 --> 00:05:10.140
So now a therapist can't even say to a child, hold on,

95
00:05:10.141 --> 00:05:11.520
I know you say you're a boy,

96
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.570
but let's explore some of the other things that seem to be upsetting you. Yeah.

97
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.150
<v 1>Can you clean that up a little bit for people that have nothing,</v>

98
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.500
no knowledge of any of this, the sort of difference between sexual identity,

99
00:05:22.501 --> 00:05:27.150
meaning your sexuality versus verse gender identity and why conversion

100
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.600
in each case or conversion therapy in these cases,

101
00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.560
it's not exactly apples to apples.

102
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.570
<v 0>Sure. So with homosexuality, you know, um, we we've, we, you know,</v>

103
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.310
we've long known that this is seems to be innate and immutable.

104
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.660
It's not the kind of thing you can sort of convert someone out of or convince

105
00:05:45.661 --> 00:05:49.770
them out of. And nor should you want to. I mean, this is,

106
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.790
there's nothing unhealthy about a gay life. There just isn't.

107
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.850
But when you're talking about, um, you know,

108
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.400
the letting a child become comfortable in their own body,

109
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.010
because gender identity, if a young woman suddenly says, I'm really a boy out,

110
00:06:05.011 --> 00:06:06.110
I need to become a boy.

111
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.130
You're setting them up to be a lifetime medical patient where they will put

112
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:12.920
testosterone in their bodies. They need to stay on it for life.

113
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.030
It has all kinds of terribly extreme side effects.

114
00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.740
They're are highly risky. Um, and unlike, you know,

115
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.560
therapy that may make her comfortable in her body,

116
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.700
the today's therapy pushes her to transition. Um,

117
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.770
that's very different from,

118
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.550
from being gay in which all the gay person asks is that you accept them for what

119
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.690
you, what they are. What, what, uh, you know, what a trans teen asks is you,

120
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:41.210
can you help me try to be what I'm not?

121
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.940
And that's a much more invasive intervention.

122
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.720
<v 1>Yeah. You know, I'm reminded as you're talking about this,</v>

123
00:06:46.721 --> 00:06:49.000
I I'm blanking on whether you mentioned the show in the book.

124
00:06:49.001 --> 00:06:51.160
Did you talk about transparent at all the show?

125
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.650
So in there's a line in the last episode of the first season

126
00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.540
where a woman who's already transitioned says to the main character,

127
00:07:01.541 --> 00:07:05.260
who's about to begin the process in effect, this is going to ruin your life.

128
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:06.640
This is going to ruin your family.

129
00:07:06.641 --> 00:07:10.570
And that in many ways is what the show ended up being about.

130
00:07:10.571 --> 00:07:12.940
And I know that's not about a child transitioning,

131
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.210
but I think a lot of what you're talking about is just that so many people just

132
00:07:16.211 --> 00:07:21.100
don't have a holistic view of what this is going to be like on the other side.

133
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:22.570
<v 0>That's exactly right.</v>

134
00:07:22.571 --> 00:07:27.430
And when I interview transgender adults who are very happy in their transitions,

135
00:07:27.431 --> 00:07:31.000
very often, they will still tell me, look, this is not easy.

136
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.380
It's not easy to go through life on all this hormonal treatment, you know,

137
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.430
holding yourself out as a member of the opposite sex. It's really hard.

138
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.010
And when, when transgender adults talk to me about it,

139
00:07:42.011 --> 00:07:45.420
they are horrified that teenagers are getting this. So this,

140
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.500
this hormonal treatments so easily,

141
00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:51.400
without any kind of understanding of the risks and, you know,

142
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:55.060
and not appreciating how hard medical transition really is.

143
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.620
<v 1>So all that being said, chapter seven is about the dissidents. There,</v>

144
00:07:59.621 --> 00:08:01.960
there are some dissidents in the field.

145
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.580
<v 0>That's right. A number of prominent people have stood out and said, hold on.</v>

146
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.990
This is way too much, way too fast with too little medical oversight. Um,

147
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.800
you know, look, the court found, you know, and I, I interviewed a lot of them,

148
00:08:14.801 --> 00:08:18.360
including, you know, Ken Zucker who chaired the entry, the,

149
00:08:18.361 --> 00:08:22.150
the writing of the entry on gender dysphoria for the DSM five,

150
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.190
the classic psychiatric manual on, uh, on mental disorders. And,

151
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:29.890
um, you know, these are people who say,

152
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:34.540
starting with the conclusion is not medicine, right? And in fact,

153
00:08:34.541 --> 00:08:36.160
last week, um, a,

154
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:40.210
the British high court examined the same protocols that they have in place in

155
00:08:40.211 --> 00:08:44.500
Britain for gender medicine. And the, the high court was appalled. They said,

156
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:45.580
you know,

157
00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:50.380
in effect what's been going on here is likely to transition a lot of young women

158
00:08:50.381 --> 00:08:53.920
who are not supposed to be transgender. And a lot of, you know,

159
00:08:53.921 --> 00:08:56.100
young people who are likely experience severe.

160
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:56.933
<v 1>Regret,</v>

161
00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.350
looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations about women's issues

162
00:09:00.351 --> 00:09:04.010
