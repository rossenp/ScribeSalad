00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.350
<v 1>Conspiracy theorists and radical freedom</v>

2
00:00:12.351 --> 00:00:16.760
extremists. I'm Dave Rubin. This is the Ruben report, direct message.

3
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.730
Four 1118 2020, November 18th, 2020.

4
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.740
We were just a week and a day, a week and a day from Thanksgiving. Wait,

5
00:00:27.741 --> 00:00:31.040
is Thanksgiving next week or the week after? It's the week after, right? No,

6
00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:34.790
it's next week. Assuming we have Thanksgiving, it's actually next week, right?

7
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.400
We have an election that's still not done and we've already rolled into

8
00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:41.180
Thanksgiving. What do you say about that? Uh, all right.

9
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.130
We got a lot of fun stories to talk about today because we're mostly going to

10
00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:47.810
be discussing,

11
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.320
discussing the hypocrisy of the Progressive's.

12
00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:55.700
And I find that fun because these people say one thing and they do something

13
00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:59.690
else. And they're generally, uh, pretty awful as public servants.

14
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.630
And we're going to unpack that. So the three stories that we're doing today,

15
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.220
AOC had a tweet from yesterday about student loan debt. They,

16
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.240
she wants, uh, other people to pay off your student loan debt.

17
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.700
Do you want me to explain how she's going to do it, but you know,

18
00:01:13.701 --> 00:01:17.090
it's just the right thing to do. You just should do the right thing.

19
00:01:17.091 --> 00:01:20.750
I guess we should also be paying off people's mortgages and car payments.

20
00:01:20.751 --> 00:01:24.290
And you know, if you took a little, uh, credit card loan to get a new TV,

21
00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:26.180
we should probably pay that off too, because you know,

22
00:01:26.181 --> 00:01:30.530
that would be what good people would do and AOC and the progressive they're very

23
00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:35.390
good because somehow they've trick people into thinking that envy is actually

24
00:01:35.391 --> 00:01:39.890
something that should be lauded and something that you should attain for.

25
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.800
Uh it's it's quite ridiculous. So we're talking about that,

26
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.380
but the hypocrisy of these people knows no bounds.

27
00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:48.320
We're also going to talk about Gavin Newsome because as you guys know already,

28
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.200
because this story is catching fire, which I'm glad to see.

29
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.330
He had a dinner with about 12 people at French laundry,

30
00:01:56.331 --> 00:02:00.800
which is a super expensive exclusive months in

31
00:02:00.801 --> 00:02:01.341
advance.

32
00:02:01.341 --> 00:02:05.870
You got to make reservations restaurant up in Yardville in Northern Cali,

33
00:02:05.871 --> 00:02:08.300
that's up in wine country. And uh,

34
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.060
people say that it's literally like a thousand bucks a plate.

35
00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:13.340
Like usually it's 400, but you throw it a little line.

36
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.990
You're walking out of there for a thousand bucks.

37
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.790
He issued this ridiculous apology. Well,

38
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:20.720
now some photos have come out from the event where he kind of made it seem like

39
00:02:20.721 --> 00:02:23.540
he was sitting outdoors, but there's chandelier's and carpet.

40
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.240
So that seems a little odd. And of course, you're not going to believe this guy.

41
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.070
He was there with lobbyist. What are the chances? Yeah.

42
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.120
And, uh, and if that's not enough, we've got one more from the brilliant,

43
00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:37.100
progressive wing of the democratic party,

44
00:02:37.101 --> 00:02:39.410
which is pretty much the whole party at this point. Uh,

45
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.850
Senator Tammy Duckworth is attacking Trump for trying to get our remaining

46
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:48.230
troops out of Afghanistan. We've been in the war in Afghanistan for what,

47
00:02:48.231 --> 00:02:51.800
like 19 years at this point, something like that 18 years.

48
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.080
And he wants to get our remaining troops out.

49
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.630
Nobody even knows why we're there anymore. Uh,

50
00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.670
but she had just an absolutely quotes.

51
00:02:59.671 --> 00:03:04.210
So we've got progressive policies that want to pay for other people's

52
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:07.510
debts, a progressive guy who's locking us down for Thanksgiving.

53
00:03:07.511 --> 00:03:10.780
Who's going into fancy restaurants and a progressive, uh,

54
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.220
who is trying to keep us in Wars. It's all very, very confusing.

55
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.800
We're going to do all of that. And then of course, you know,

56
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:21.340
w what sits on top of this obviously is that we're still in this sort of

57
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:25.660
election limbo. Everybody is waiting to release the crackin.

58
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.990
They keep saying, we're going to release the crackin and Sidney Powell.

59
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.170
Who's Trump's lawyer and Giuliani that they've got this big info.

60
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:36.790
And as I said yesterday, you know, the interesting thing here is people I think,

61
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:38.590
want more info to be dropped. Like,

62
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:40.480
I think people want to wake up everyday and be like, Oh,

63
00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:42.940
we found out this in Wisconsin. We found out this in Arizona,

64
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:47.710
we found out this in Pennsylvania, and that's not exactly how a legal case, uh,

65
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.450
can come together, can coalesce, right? Like they, they have to build a case.

66
00:03:52.451 --> 00:03:54.640
I think these are people who know how to build a case.

67
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.210
So we'll see if that cracking gets released,

68
00:03:58.211 --> 00:04:01.420
but we're not going to get too far into the nitty gritty of the election today.

69
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:04.270
I thought, I'd give you a little break on that, but before we do anything else,

70
00:04:04.271 --> 00:04:05.104
people,

71
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.790
are you looking for a new protein bar that tastes like a candy bar?

72
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.860
You're not going to believe it. I'm holding one in my hand right now.

73
00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:13.300
I've got just the brand for you.

74
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.590
Built bars are super tasty and coming 18 amazing flavors.

75
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.040
I shared them with my family and staff recently, Michael had one this morning,

76
00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:23.830
which is fun because everyone picked a different flavor.

77
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.430
My personal favorite is cookies and cream. As I have right here,

78
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.290
bill bars are covered in a hundred percent.

79
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:33.310
Chocolate include both nut and nut-free flavors and are soft and easy to chew

80
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.980
with the holidays just around the corner. It's easy to slip up,

81
00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:40.180
which is why built bars are the perfect alternative to pie for the health

82
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.493
conscious guy.

83
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.890
I can actually lose or maintain weight while indulging in a delicious treat.

84
00:04:44.891 --> 00:04:47.410

88
00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:04.990
Now back to me. Hello. Uh, okay. Let's talk about this tweet from AOC.

89
00:05:04.991 --> 00:05:08.310
We'll throw the tweet up on the screen and I will read it to you.

90
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.350
AOC things were bad for me, so they should stay bad for her.

91
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.670
Everyone else is not a good argument against debt cancellation,

92
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.740
student medical or otherwise hashtag cancel

93
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.360
student debt. Okay.

94
00:05:24.361 --> 00:05:27.960
So let's talk a little bit about canceling student debt.

95
00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.140
I find one of the best ways to discuss this is,

96
00:05:31.141 --> 00:05:33.420
think about your own personal situation.

97
00:05:33.421 --> 00:05:37.950
So I remember when I was applying to colleges way back in

98
00:05:37.951 --> 00:05:42.000
1993. Okay. You can do the math. On my age,

99
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.570
I was applying to colleges and I wanted to go to Syracuse university.

100
00:05:45.571 --> 00:05:48.900
I grew up in New York. Syracuse is a private school, upstate New York.

101
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.420
And I wanted to go to Syracuse university because they had a great sports

102
00:05:51.421 --> 00:05:55.380
broadcast program. I believe by Bob Costas went there, Marv Albert.

103
00:05:55.381 --> 00:05:59.080
I want it to be a, like a center anchor kind of thing. But I, I,

104
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.000
I knew I wanted it to be a broadcaster of some sort, I guess,

105
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.390
I guess it worked out, I suppose. Um,

106
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.230
I wanted to go to Syracuse and my dad looked at the numbers.

107
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:12.950
We got the application and we're looking at everything and it was something like

108
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:17.840
$25,000 a year to go to Syracuse. And my dad made it very clear. He said,

109
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:19.100
if you want to go to Syracuse,

110
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:20.750
you're going to have to take out the loans to do it.

111
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:22.160
But if you want to stay in state,

112
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.040
meaning go to a state school here in New York and in New York,

113
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:28.010
at least at the time had some pretty good state schools.

114
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.330
They're called SUNY state university of New York, S U N Y. Um,

115
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.420
if you want to go to a SUNY school, which are like 8,000 bucks,

116
00:06:35.421 --> 00:06:38.780
something like that, we'll pay for it. And I remember thinking, okay,

117
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.930
I can either get into a hundred thousand dollars debt.

118
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.110
I didn't even really fully understand what that meant as a young kid,

119
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:47.750
but I was like, you know, a young person, but I was like, all right,

120
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:51.830
that doesn't seem good to walk out of school and then have to pay all this money

121
00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:52.311
back. Right?

122
00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:54.890
Like that almost seems like the reverse of school school should be setting you

123
00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:58.670
up. So now you're ready to roll. You're ready to explode into the world and,

124
00:06:58.671 --> 00:07:02.330
and, and produce and, and get and all of those things.

125
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.470
So I said, all right, I'm going to a SUNY school. And I went to SUNY Binghamton,

126
00:07:06.471 --> 00:07:08.150
which at the time was, was quite a good school.

127
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.310
They've got a bunch of problems around free speech now. And, um,

128
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.260
they'd been trying to invite me there to make it happen.

129
00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:15.440
We haven't been able to do it cause a COVID yet, but in essence, uh,

130
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.600
my folks paid for it. It wasn't that much money.

131
00:07:17.601 --> 00:07:20.390
And I got a pretty solid education. I was a political science major.

132
00:07:20.391 --> 00:07:21.740
So maybe something got through to me.

133
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.590
And although I wasn't progressive for a while after that.

134
00:07:24.591 --> 00:07:27.410
So I'll have to rethink that one. But the point is,

135
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.540
everyone in their life makes choices.

136
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.830
So I chose not to get a hundred thousand dollars plus into debt. Now,

137
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.820
Syracuse university at the time, as I said was about 25 grand right now,

138
00:07:37.821 --> 00:07:38.990
Syracuse university,

139
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.060
$54,000 a year,

140
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.930
without food or housing with food or housing,

141
00:07:46.931 --> 00:07:48.820
they estimate that it will be

142
00:07:48.821 --> 00:07:53.350
$75,000 per year to

143
00:07:53.351 --> 00:07:55.630
go to this college. Now, I don't even need to,

144
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.510
to comment on Syracuse university as a, as a university,

145
00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:01.870
specifically 75 times four, let's do the math here.

146
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:06.100
People that's about 300 grand. That means if you're taking out loans, right.

147
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.820
To go to Syracuse university, to be whatever it is that you want to be.

148
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.980
You walk out of that university in the hole for 300 grand.

149
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:19.300
Now, even if you get an incredible job right after college,

150
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.960
the idea that you're, let's say, I don't know, out of college,

151
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.090
if you've got an $80,000 a year job out of college,

152
00:08:25.091 --> 00:08:28.540
that's pretty freaking awesome. You're still $300,000 in debt,

153
00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:30.280
and it's not like that 80 grand goes to pay that off.

154
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:31.840
You got to live and everything else. Anyway,

155
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.990
I mentioned all of this because AOC is tweet,

156
00:08:34.991 --> 00:08:37.630
which I'm just going to read again real quick. Uh, why don't we,

157
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.000
why don't we throw that back up there? Connor? Um,

158
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:41.770
she says things were bad for me,

159
00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:45.490
so they should stay bad for everyone else is not a good argument against debt

160
00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:47.230
cancellation, student medical,

161
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:52.330
or otherwise everyone makes choices in life.

162
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:55.710
And if you choose to go into a lot of debt, well,

163
00:08:55.711 --> 00:08:58.820
then it's on you pay it off. That's just the truth.

164
00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.130
Now there there's an irony here because the implication,

165
00:09:01.131 --> 00:09:03.260
this is what progressives do with almost every policy.

166
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.770
It's sort of sounds right. Cancel student debt, students have it,

167
00:09:06.771 --> 00:09:11.360
tough young people have it tough in this changing economy and we should help

168
00:09:11.361 --> 00:09:13.520
them out. Well, that sort of sounds right. And by the way,

169
00:09:13.521 --> 00:09:14.630
I think there are some ways,

170
00:09:14.631 --> 00:09:18.410
ways that you can help young people and reduce expenses for college.

171
00:09:18.411 --> 00:09:21.170
And our college is way too expensive. And actually in many cases,

172
00:09:21.171 --> 00:09:25.160
making children, young people, yes they are. Um,

173
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.950
but if you were to cancel student debt first off,

174
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.950
let's think about all the people who just pay it, get off their debt. Well,

175
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:32.150
they're a bunch of suckers, right?

176
00:09:32.151 --> 00:09:34.880
They played by the rules and now they paid off their debt.

177
00:09:34.881 --> 00:09:38.930
And then their tax dollars after doing the right thing will now go to pay off

178
00:09:38.931 --> 00:09:42.110
someone else's debt. So that, that doesn't seem right. Right, right there.

179
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.240
But also when you say, cancel student debt,

180
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:48.770
you realize AOC that you're talking about, excuse me,

181
00:09:48.771 --> 00:09:52.820
you're talking about a lot of middle class and upper middle class people who

182
00:09:52.821 --> 00:09:56.570
take these loans to go to these obscenely expensive private schools,

183
00:09:56.571 --> 00:10:01.220
like Syracuse get $300,000 into debt. And then you, in essence,

184
00:10:01.221 --> 00:10:05.120
you're not even poor people having their tax money to go to pay off that stuff.

185
00:10:05.121 --> 00:10:09.350
So it doesn't make sense at any level whatsoever. Um,

186
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:13.100
but this is just consistent with progressive do. It's sort of sounds right.

187
00:10:13.101 --> 00:10:15.340
We don't have to think about the second and third order of things,

188
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:20.420
but what's interesting here is she also says student medical or otherwise now

189
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:21.650
think, I think there are some arguments,

190
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:24.470
as I just said about colleges that they cost too much.

191
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.980
I think that obviously medical bills can really add up and there should be all

192
00:10:27.981 --> 00:10:30.470
sorts of ways that we can help to fray that.

193
00:10:30.471 --> 00:10:34.610
And I believe in competition so that hopefully you would have more hospitals out

194
00:10:34.611 --> 00:10:37.880
there that could do different procedures because competition actually causes

195
00:10:37.881 --> 00:10:41.930
prices to drop. So that's sort of a separate issue, but interestingly she says,

196
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:46.430
or otherwise, or otherwise meaning other types of debt.

197
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:52.100
I have a house mortgage. Could you pay that off for me, AOC? Uh,

198
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:57.050
I have a car mortgage, a car loan. Could you pay that off for me?

199
00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:58.250
Like this,

200
00:10:58.251 --> 00:11:02.660
this idea of what it all boils down to two is they just want to say things that

201
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:05.930
outsource in essence, all of your responsibility,

202
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.450
and they'll just take care of you.

203
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:10.610
And as long as you don't fight back against them,

204
00:11:10.611 --> 00:11:11.750
they'll always take care of you.

205
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.360
But then one day you might realize that they're not as benevolent,

206
00:11:14.361 --> 00:11:17.570
as good as they say they are. And then you're in a lot of trouble.

207
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.270
So the idea of debt cancellation,

208
00:11:20.271 --> 00:11:24.020
if you've got somebody in your family that really thinks it's the right thing,

209
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.850
remind them they are paying off most likely a middle class or upper middle

210
00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.040
class student young.

211
00:11:31.041 --> 00:11:34.850
Person's extremely expensive education.

212
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.710
If you want it to say to me, Hey,

213
00:11:36.711 --> 00:11:41.330
we should put more tax dollars to have better public

214
00:11:41.331 --> 00:11:43.490
schools that maybe aren't, uh,

215
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.690
indoctrinating young people with identity politics and critical race theory and

216
00:11:47.691 --> 00:11:51.080
the rest of it. Well, that would be an interesting debate to have, right?

217
00:11:51.081 --> 00:11:52.280
I think there's an argument for that.

218
00:11:52.281 --> 00:11:54.760
The more libertarian side of me says the government should have nothing to do

219
00:11:54.761 --> 00:11:57.670
with it. But I actually think, you know, I'm the product of,

220
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:01.240
of pretty good public education. I went to a public elementary school,

221
00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:04.360
public middle school, public high school, as I said, I went to a New York state,

222
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:08.770
uh, college. So like, I think it can work.

223
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:12.910
Our system is now so beaten up. And so corroded and has had,

224
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:17.320
and especially at the academic level has had so many bad ideas. In fact,

225
00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:21.250
the entire thing that maybe it can't turn around and maybe these things have to

226
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:25.030
drop, have to just cry, crumble and collapse. Maybe they do.

227
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:29.100
But the point is don't think that just because someone says they're for death

228
00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.600
cancellation, that it means it means anything. That it means that they're good.

229
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:34.411
What they're,

230
00:12:34.411 --> 00:12:38.610
what they're really saying is we're going to take other people's money to pay

231
00:12:38.611 --> 00:12:42.540
for someone else's mistake and or may not even mistake.

232
00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.420
Someone's happy that they took the debt out. Well, then let them pay it back,

233
00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:46.680
let them pay it back. But this,

234
00:12:46.681 --> 00:12:50.280
they love these one blank get answers for everybody.

235
00:12:50.281 --> 00:12:53.790
And it doesn't really work in itself. Certainly doesn't work economically.

236
00:12:53.791 --> 00:12:57.420
And here we are. So AOC, this one goes out to you. You ain't,

237
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.530
you ain't right on this one sister and yet, right on most of the stuff. Uh,

238
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.910
but speaking of economics, people, I want to talk to you about Glint pay.

239
00:13:05.911 --> 00:13:07.560
You guys know I've been talking about Glen pay.

240
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:11.370
I actually really love what they're doing here. So Glint pay, uh,

241
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.470
this is the card. This is not my actual card,

242
00:13:13.471 --> 00:13:16.170
but it is what your card would look like. Um,

243
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.690
you can buy and sell gold on Glint pay,

244
00:13:18.691 --> 00:13:22.770
and then you could use the card as an actual debit card.

245
00:13:22.771 --> 00:13:26.400
So you can choose whether you're buying coffee or you're buying sneakers,

246
00:13:26.401 --> 00:13:27.990
or you're paying for dinner at a restaurant.

247
00:13:27.991 --> 00:13:29.220
If you're allowed to go to a restaurant,

248
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.650
you can choose at that moment via the app.

249
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:35.070
You can choose whether you want to pay in gold or in dollars.

250
00:13:35.071 --> 00:13:39.030
It's a great way to just get involved in the gold games so that you have

251
00:13:39.031 --> 00:13:43.140
something that's backed a little bit more sensibly perhaps than the U S dollar,

252
00:13:43.141 --> 00:13:46.320
which is in a bit of a strange position at the moment. Uh,

253
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:49.140
I love what's going on with Olympia. As I said, I've bought coffee.

254
00:13:49.141 --> 00:13:52.290
I bought sneakers. Um, I bought some stuff on Amazon.

255
00:13:52.291 --> 00:13:54.570
There's all sorts of stuff you can do. Uh, and again,

256
00:13:54.571 --> 00:13:59.040
you can choose whether you want to spend your gold or your us dollars.

257
00:13:59.041 --> 00:14:01.260
You can also buy gold on there, sell gold everything else.

258
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.920
The Glint card is issued by Sutton bank, which is member of FDI.

259
00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:09.120
See pursuant to license from MasterCard international. It's free to sign up.

260
00:14:09.121 --> 00:14:13.830
So go to Glint, pay.com/rubin for more info and to start purchasing gold today,

261
00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.640
that's Glenn pay.com/ruben to get your goal today.

262
00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.130
And now back to me, all right,

263
00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:23.820
let's talk about another brilliant progressive politician.

264
00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:28.440
So first off we started with AOC with an imaginary way that she's going to pay

265
00:14:28.441 --> 00:14:31.530
off debt, not a real thing, but she says it and she can do it.

266
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.080
And that's a perfect segue to Gavin Newsome,

267
00:14:34.081 --> 00:14:38.190
who is our governor here in California. And he was caught.

268
00:14:38.191 --> 00:14:40.380
We're going to show you some of the photos right now.

269
00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:43.470
He was caught at a restaurant known as French laundry,

270
00:14:43.471 --> 00:14:46.380
which is one of the most exclusive expensive restaurants in all of them,

271
00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:51.030
California. I think I mentioned a day or two ago that I tried to go there.

272
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:54.530
Last time we were in Sonoma and you had to have reservations for months and

273
00:14:54.531 --> 00:14:58.460
months in advance. Uh, my friend Kelly Rizzo, who's a food blogger.

274
00:14:58.461 --> 00:15:00.950
I have tweeted out that it's about 400 bucks a plate.

275
00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:03.500
She reminded me that free throwing a little wine and whatever.

276
00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:04.340
Some of the extras are.

277
00:15:04.341 --> 00:15:06.770
You're not walking out of there for under a thousand dollars a plate.

278
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.510
Now I don't begrudge anybody.

279
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.770
I don't begrudge anybody from spending their hard earned money on these things,

280
00:15:12.771 --> 00:15:14.900
but you're not going to believe this guy has Gavin Newsome. Well,

281
00:15:14.901 --> 00:15:18.520
first off he said he was outdoors. As you can see by the pictures there, uh,

282
00:15:18.521 --> 00:15:22.910
that doesn't appear to be outdoors with giant mirrors and Shandel ears and fancy

283
00:15:22.911 --> 00:15:26.210
carpet that doesn't look outdoors. Uh, nobody's wearing a mask.

284
00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.440
There are 12 people there.

285
00:15:27.441 --> 00:15:30.800
He wants you to have less than 10 people in your own home,

286
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.560
and you're not gonna believe it. Guys.

287
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.590
There were a lobbyist at the dinner.

288
00:15:36.591 --> 00:15:39.230
Here is the quote from Politico,

289
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.050
California medical association.

290
00:15:42.051 --> 00:15:46.910
Officials were among the guests seated next to governor Gavin Newsome at a top

291
00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.820
California political political operatives,

292
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:54.560
opulent birthday dinner at French laundry restaurant

293
00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:56.120
this month. Uh,

294
00:15:56.150 --> 00:16:00.830
it was the CEO of the California medical association and some other lobbyists

295
00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:01.431
that were there.

296
00:16:01.431 --> 00:16:06.020
So just the hypocrisy just knows no bounds.

297
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:08.900
And I know, I know all politicians are hypocrites.

298
00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:13.250
These are people who want to exercise power over you while they live a

299
00:16:13.251 --> 00:16:17.060
completely different lifestyle. You know, think back to Nancy Pelosi,

300
00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:18.650
another progressive genius.

301
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:23.000
Remember at the beginning of lockdown and she's got all of this freaking ice

302
00:16:23.001 --> 00:16:27.800
cream in her twin, double Z fridges. And it's like, I don't begrudge her that,

303
00:16:27.801 --> 00:16:31.310
although somehow she got really rich while being a public servant. Um,

304
00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.220
but like I know that, especially at the beginning of lockdown,

305
00:16:34.221 --> 00:16:36.770
when we were all freaking out and we were all stocking up on food,

306
00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.890
I didn't buy any ice cream. You know what we bought? We bought protein,

307
00:16:39.891 --> 00:16:42.920
we bought rice, we bought pasta. Um,

308
00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:46.610
we filled our freezer up with frozen meat and fish and things like that.

309
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.910
Chicken. We weren't just filling it up with ice cream, but she had like,

310
00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:50.181
you know,

311
00:16:50.181 --> 00:16:54.140
20 different types of ice cream and she's getting a haircut while she's telling

312
00:16:54.141 --> 00:16:55.370
people not to get haircuts.

313
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.450
And mayor Lightfoot in Chicago is telling people to stay home while she's out

314
00:16:59.451 --> 00:17:01.130
there celebrating, Biden's win.

315
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:06.560
Every one of these people is the worst type of hypocrite and they

316
00:17:06.561 --> 00:17:11.450
should not be in charge or have literally anything to do with

317
00:17:11.451 --> 00:17:15.140
your life. You know, I joked on the show yesterday on not on my show.

318
00:17:15.141 --> 00:17:17.750
I joked on, uh, I was on John box, uh,

319
00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.420
John Bachman show on Newsmax.

320
00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:24.850
And I joked that maybe I would run for governor of California and a zillion

321
00:17:24.851 --> 00:17:26.410
people thought I was serious. And then they were,

322
00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:30.160
they were literally like thousands of retweets flying around about Dave Rubin

323
00:17:30.161 --> 00:17:33.970
running for governor of California. I mean, let's, let's recall Gavin Newsome.

324
00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:35.530
And then I guess stranger things have happened,

325
00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.110
but my C would just be the reverse Newsome.

326
00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:40.300
I would just run as the reverse Newsome at that man.

327
00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.850
Hasn't my policy is the worst. He's going to raise taxes.

328
00:17:42.851 --> 00:17:46.530
I'm going to lower taxes. He wants to lock you down. I'm going to free ya. Uh,

329
00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:50.070
he loves just allowing homeless people to run everywhere and do drugs

330
00:17:50.071 --> 00:17:53.010
everywhere. We'll we'll clean that up. We got crappy roads here.

331
00:17:53.011 --> 00:17:55.350
I'm going to fix the roads. I don't want to run for governor.

332
00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.630
That's literally the, I don't want a dime at first off.

333
00:17:57.631 --> 00:18:00.630
I would also not take a dime from anyone that's for sure.

334
00:18:00.631 --> 00:18:02.940
Like I got a YouTube channel. I'll get my message out there.

335
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.720
I wouldn't take a dime, but anyway, I'm, I'm basically kidding on this.

336
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.000
Although there is a part of me that's now kind of like, eh,

337
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:13.170
maybe I'll just do it. Cause these people are just absolutely awful. Um,

338
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:17.190
but it's just really important to see these pictures and just know,

339
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.480
just know that these people who are telling you that you have to wear masks

340
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:23.850
literally inside your house,

341
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.330
Pennsylvania announced that today they want people to wear masks inside their

342
00:18:27.331 --> 00:18:31.380
house. Although they do acknowledge that it will be tough to enforce,

343
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:36.570
but just try to imagine the level of psychotic authoritarian power that they

344
00:18:36.571 --> 00:18:40.170
want to exercise over you, that you have friends over forget friends.

345
00:18:40.171 --> 00:18:43.290
You have just your family in your house and they think it's,

346
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:48.060
it would be okay to somehow be monitoring you. What is going on here?

347
00:18:48.061 --> 00:18:52.710
This is what the worst sort of authoritarian regimes do and were being

348
00:18:52.711 --> 00:18:56.370
tested. People were being tested to see how far they could push us.

349
00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.300
That's not some crazy conspiracy theory. That's just obvious. So sorry,

350
00:19:00.301 --> 00:19:02.910
Gavin Newsome. I'm not going to listen to your nonsense.

351
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.860
I'm going to have people at my house.

352
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:09.060
We're going to hug and we're going to talk and we're going to laugh and we're

353
00:19:09.061 --> 00:19:12.990
going to sing and do all of those things. Okay. We just are,

354
00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.480
and you can suck it. All right, moving on.

355
00:19:15.481 --> 00:19:20.010
Let's talk a one more brilliant progressive politician. Uh,

356
00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.350
this is Senator Tammy Duckworth,

357
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:27.300
and she had a bit of an odd reaction to Trump talking about ending

358
00:19:27.301 --> 00:19:28.230
the war in Afghanistan.

359
00:19:28.231 --> 00:19:31.800
Now it's really interesting what's happening right now because as the Biden

360
00:19:31.801 --> 00:19:34.950
transition team starts to leak out what some of their info is. Well,

361
00:19:34.951 --> 00:19:37.950
it seems like they want to reverse a lot of the gains that we've had in the

362
00:19:37.951 --> 00:19:39.480
middle East. We're not going to war there anymore.

363
00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:40.710
There've been peace deals signed,

364
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.970
but now they want to get back into the Iran deal and a bunch of other stuff. Um,

365
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.090
we're hearing that Trump who was taking our troops out of Germany,

366
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.880
remember we're not at war with Germany anymore. Uh,

367
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:52.860
Biden now wants to keep tropes there,

368
00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:57.060
like all of the old ideas of the past and the bad neo-con ideas.

369
00:19:57.061 --> 00:20:00.240
They now are just, they're just have been laundered in effect in there.

370
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:02.010
Now they're Democrat ideas.

371
00:20:02.011 --> 00:20:04.800
So Trump has wanted us out of Afghanistan from the beginning.

372
00:20:04.801 --> 00:20:06.300
He was talking about it years ago.

373
00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:10.470
And we've been at war in Afghanistan for almost two decades.

374
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.650
It's the longest war in American history. I mean, really think about that.

375
00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:18.180
Cause nobody even realizes we're at war there, but the Afghanistan war Google,

376
00:20:18.181 --> 00:20:23.010
it don't take my word for it. It is now the longest war in American history.

377
00:20:23.011 --> 00:20:27.450
Now why are we there? I know the Taliban and nine 11 and okay,

378
00:20:27.451 --> 00:20:30.810
all that stuff. We could talk about all that. We're disrupting networks.

379
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:33.540
We're getting them there so they don't get us here, blah, blah, blah, blah,

380
00:20:33.541 --> 00:20:35.790
blah. There is no reason to be there anymore.

381
00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:38.340
Absolutely no reason to be there anymore. So Trump's try and end it,

382
00:20:38.341 --> 00:20:39.690
try to get the troops out.

383
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:43.050
Here's Senator Tammy Duckworth on what Trump is doing.

384
00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:45.800
<v 2>All of the military commanders have spoken up and say,</v>

385
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:48.760
this is the wrong thing to do. We want our troops home,

386
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.250
but let's not bring them home in body bags.

387
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.140
And that's potentially what's going to happen.

388
00:20:53.141 --> 00:20:57.610
If this president gets his way and puts his own political timeline ahead of our

389
00:20:57.611 --> 00:20:58.570
national security.

390
00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:03.420
<v 1>I mean the level of hypocrisy there is so off the charts,</v>

391
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:07.350
how is getting our troops out of Afghanistan,

392
00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:11.040
going to cause our troops to come home in body bags?

393
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.580
Are we going to be shooting our own troops as they get on the plans on the way

394
00:21:14.581 --> 00:21:18.330
home? I don't think so. You know, what would cause more troops to die,

395
00:21:18.331 --> 00:21:22.170
staying in a place that we're not even sure why we're there anymore, right?

396
00:21:22.171 --> 00:21:23.220
Every day that you stay there,

397
00:21:23.221 --> 00:21:25.680
you increase the risk that somebody is going to die.

398
00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:30.210
If you say we are now leaving, well, then less people are going to die.

399
00:21:30.211 --> 00:21:33.360
Less troops are going to die the way she says that that we're going to bring

400
00:21:33.361 --> 00:21:36.300
them home in body bags because of Trump's timeline. By the way,

401
00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:40.590
let's remember this. One of the reasons that Barack Obama became president,

402
00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:42.090
a lot of people forget this,

403
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:47.760
but one of the reasons that he became president 12 years ago was because

404
00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:52.080
in the, in the democratic primary, Hillary Clinton was saying, you know,

405
00:21:52.081 --> 00:21:55.410
we need to have some sort of sensible withdrawal from Iraq.

406
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:58.110
I want to get out of her act, but we, it needs to be a sensible withdrawal.

407
00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:01.440
And Obama was basically like, we're leaving, we're leaving no matter what.

408
00:22:01.441 --> 00:22:04.380
And the, and the base, the progressive base was like, all right,

409
00:22:04.381 --> 00:22:06.720
let's just get the hell out of there. Now, ironically,

410
00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.050
what ended up happening in Iraq, which is, well,

411
00:22:10.051 --> 00:22:11.340
you all know what happened in Iraq,

412
00:22:11.341 --> 00:22:15.120
which is that they started having a free and fair elections, right?

413
00:22:15.121 --> 00:22:17.670
We also saw the pictures. And then in essence,

414
00:22:17.671 --> 00:22:21.810
we got the hell out of there so quick that Iraq is now just basically a failed

415
00:22:21.811 --> 00:22:24.690
state. Now that's, you can argue either way, what we should have stayed longer.

416
00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:27.330
If you break it, you got to fix it. We can have all those arguments,

417
00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.110
but the point is, we don't even know why we're in Afghanistan anymore.

418
00:22:31.111 --> 00:22:35.340
There's just no reason to be there. And we got to get out. So anyway,

419
00:22:35.341 --> 00:22:40.320
the reason I wanted to do this story is we're being sold a lot of bad

420
00:22:40.321 --> 00:22:42.990
ideas that we put away already.

421
00:22:42.991 --> 00:22:46.650
We put the bad ideas of endless Wars away. And you know,

422
00:22:46.651 --> 00:22:49.530
they'll tell you that Trump is this warmonger and everything else, but you know,

423
00:22:49.531 --> 00:22:53.190
Trump, you know what he did like the, the two big things that he did,

424
00:22:53.191 --> 00:22:54.600
foreign policy wise that actually,

425
00:22:54.601 --> 00:22:58.650
I think basically kept us out of Wars for the last four years.

426
00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:01.470
He did two things remember, right? When he became president,

427
00:23:01.471 --> 00:23:06.240
he dropped the M O a B, uh,

428
00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:09.540
he dropped the M O a B. That was the mother of all bombs.

429
00:23:09.541 --> 00:23:13.350
He dropped that thing and everyone said, this is going to start world war three.

430
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.480
Okay. And it never started world war three.

431
00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:18.840
And then he killed her rainy in general Soleimani. And everyone said,

432
00:23:18.841 --> 00:23:20.670
this is going to start world war three. Oh.

433
00:23:20.671 --> 00:23:22.590
And then he also brought on John Bolton and everyone said,

434
00:23:22.591 --> 00:23:24.120
this is going to start world war three.

435
00:23:24.121 --> 00:23:26.670
And that net neutrality is going to start world war three and everything else.

436
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:30.450
The guy did a couple of things by dropping this bomb saying to people, Hey,

437
00:23:30.451 --> 00:23:32.880
we're, we're, we're a little muddy. We're a little nutty.

438
00:23:32.881 --> 00:23:33.810
You better not mess with us.

439
00:23:33.811 --> 00:23:36.390
So we're going to drop this bomb and then guess what, nobody messed with us.

440
00:23:36.391 --> 00:23:39.420
And he took out ISIS. Then he killed this Iranian general. And everyone said,

441
00:23:39.421 --> 00:23:41.850
you see, Iran's going to get to go crazy now.

442
00:23:41.851 --> 00:23:43.920
And we're in a lot of trouble and they're going to activate all these super

443
00:23:43.921 --> 00:23:46.700
cells and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And absolutely nothing happened.

444
00:23:46.701 --> 00:23:49.340
He looked at the middle East deals and said, okay,

445
00:23:49.341 --> 00:23:53.840
this isn't working right direct negotiations between these two parties don't

446
00:23:53.841 --> 00:23:55.970
work because the Palestinians refuse to accept the deal.

447
00:23:55.970 --> 00:24:00.020
So we're just going to start looking elsewhere and find countries that will sign

448
00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.310
peace deals. And they did.

449
00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:06.620
And now we're being told by Democrats that we have to stay in

450
00:24:06.621 --> 00:24:10.400
Afghanistan longer. It just doesn't make any sense.

451
00:24:10.401 --> 00:24:13.100
And that's why I wanted to do these three stories today,

452
00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:18.140
because these are the policies of the Democrats

453
00:24:18.141 --> 00:24:21.830
now will pay off loans, even though there's no money for it.

454
00:24:21.831 --> 00:24:23.660
And it's unfair to do. And it's actually,

455
00:24:23.661 --> 00:24:28.310
anti-American in many ways to take money from some to just give it to others,

456
00:24:28.311 --> 00:24:32.540
to cover their mistakes. Like that's not an American ideal. Okay.

457
00:24:32.541 --> 00:24:36.650
So that was this first story we covered. The second story, you know,

458
00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:39.530
we're going to lock you down at home. We're going to crush your business,

459
00:24:39.531 --> 00:24:42.560
destroy your restaurant, but me Gavin Newsome,

460
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:45.680
I'm going to go out and live like a King and not even listen to my words.

461
00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.160
And by the way, his apology, if you saw the video was absolutely disgusting.

462
00:24:49.161 --> 00:24:53.450
He's laughing through it. He's laughing through it. He's the worst sort of smug,

463
00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:58.460
awful good that you got. And then the third story where in essence,

464
00:24:58.461 --> 00:25:00.350
they're saying more endless Wars,

465
00:25:00.351 --> 00:25:03.350
let's just do more and more and more endless Wars.

466
00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:07.850
I think that it's a nice package to sort of explain that the craziness of the

467
00:25:07.851 --> 00:25:08.810
left and that way,

468
00:25:08.811 --> 00:25:13.100
it got us a little bit away today of just focusing on the election,

469
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:18.020
uh, in any event guys. Oh, I should tell you this. Before I wrap up, uh,

470
00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:21.650
I did an interview a couple of days ago, two days ago with Yon MI park.

471
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:26.240
She is a North Korean defector turned human rights, activists. This girl,

472
00:25:26.241 --> 00:25:29.330
I had met her. She came here. I, I had some people over for dinner.

473
00:25:29.331 --> 00:25:31.070
I don't want to get in any trouble,

474
00:25:31.071 --> 00:25:33.980
but I did have a bunch of people over here for dinner a couple of weeks ago,

475
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:38.390
and Yon me joined. And she is an absolutely wonderful,

476
00:25:38.391 --> 00:25:41.480
magical human being. And I interviewed her.

477
00:25:41.481 --> 00:25:44.390
She tells her story of at 13 years old, leaving North Korea,

478
00:25:44.391 --> 00:25:47.150
what it was like the horrific conditions that she lived in and,

479
00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:50.480
and what happened to her and being sold into sex, slavery and everything else.

480
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:52.670
Meanwhile, she has made it to America now,

481
00:25:52.671 --> 00:25:56.570
and she is fighting for freedom and capitalism and democracy.

482
00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:00.800
But the scary part of the interview is she sees some of the markings of what

483
00:26:00.801 --> 00:26:05.450
went on in North Korea and what went on in China when she eventually got there,

484
00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:09.890
she sees some of the beginnings of that happening here. Um, so I just highly,

485
00:26:09.891 --> 00:26:12.170
highly recommend you check it out. We just put up, uh,

486
