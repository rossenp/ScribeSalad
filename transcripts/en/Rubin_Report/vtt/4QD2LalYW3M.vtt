1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.530
<v 0>Kim Jong-un can never exist without Chinese communist party sponsorship.</v>

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.110
There's no way he can be dictated right now.

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.640
And he's improving 25 millions of people and the United nations,

4
00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:13.710
they are saying only resemblance.

5
00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:16.830
We can see what's happening to North Korean people is a Holocaust.

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.140
That's what cause it happening again,

7
00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:23.490
North Korea and the words denying your game and the mainstream, of course,

8
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:27.240
Hollywood and media, because they don't want to like upset China.

9
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.660
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

10
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.310
<v 2>How were you sort of welcomed into inter the Western world after</v>

11
00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:43.820
this? I mean, now you live in Chicago now you're your friends.

12
00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:47.540
We have a ton of similar friends that are, that are all fighting these battles,

13
00:00:47.541 --> 00:00:50.150
but, but you've lived through this battle. How did,

14
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.370
how did you go from just sort of activism in South Korea to,

15
00:00:54.371 --> 00:00:55.400
to where you are now?

16
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.090
<v 0>Yeah, in South Korea, unfortunately I was heavily,</v>

17
00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:02.030
heavily discriminated and I couldn't feed in.

18
00:01:02.031 --> 00:01:06.860
I had to lie to people that I was South Korean because they were so many

19
00:01:06.861 --> 00:01:10.700
things like South Koreans who were discriminated against for North Koreans.

20
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.920
And that's why I chose to come to America.

21
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.470
Even the people who say this is like racist country.

22
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.150
This is a congestion where most embracing included in my life.

23
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.120
So I chose ESS my home because it's like,

24
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.850
there's no racism for me here to experience. Right.

25
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.960
<v 2>So before we get to the non racism of the United States, so,</v>

26
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.890
so South Koreans were discriminating against North Koreans. Was that,

27
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.160
was that simply because they didn't know North Koreans or they felt that too

28
00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:39.740
many North Koreans were coming over or what, what is that?

29
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.740
Because you don't really think that there would be that type of discrimination.

30
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.440
<v 0>Just because we are coming from a poor country and, you know, South Koreans,</v>

31
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.100
uh, they discriminate against like Southeast Asians like that.

32
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.440
NAMI's Thailand in PI Filipinos and North Korea is also a poor country.

33
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.130
I don't think they discriminate people as much when they come from France or

34
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.190
Europe or Western Europe or like USA,

35
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.690
but without when people coming from poor country. So we,

36
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.780
even though we were saying people, when I went to South Korea,

37
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.710
they were just making fun of my accent because I was speaking with Northern

38
00:02:15.711 --> 00:02:19.520
accent and, you know, they were asking me like, I used by,

39
00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:23.780
why are you talking to me? And it's like, if I were spy,

40
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.980
why would I even escape? So it was very tough.

41
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.540
<v 2>Right? So what put you on my radar was a few months ago,</v>

42
00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:36.750
a whole bunch of people started sending me a video of you talking about your,

43
00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:38.600
your adventure and your journey and everything else.

44
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.760
And you happen to mention that you read don't burn this book and that it helped

45
00:02:43.761 --> 00:02:44.361
you in some way,

46
00:02:44.361 --> 00:02:49.160
which is I don't even have the words to explain my gratitude for

47
00:02:49.161 --> 00:02:49.821
that. I mean, it's,

48
00:02:49.821 --> 00:02:53.150
it's just beyond imagination considering what you've lived through.

49
00:02:53.151 --> 00:02:56.150
But in essence, you are now here in the United States.

50
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.550
Do you consider yourself an activist first?

51
00:02:58.551 --> 00:03:01.020
Like what do you consider yourself now? Really? You're,

52
00:03:01.021 --> 00:03:03.880
you're an author obviously. And you're out there fighting all these battles,

53
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:05.620
but what, what do you consider yourself now?

54
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.310
<v 0>Because I'm a fighter and trying to fight against North Korea,</v>

55
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.150
dictatorship and Chinese communist party that sponsors dictator should be North

56
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.350
Korea. And I think that's why I began. I mean, on chair,

57
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.280
I read your book and it was, uh, I was more trying to be,

58
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.300
you know what? I tried to do my best to raise awareness.

59
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.890
And at Hollywood, everybody, they don't pick up North Korean story.

60
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.490
Like they talk about slavery and they talk about like Malala,

61
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.900
who was shot by Taliban.

62
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.370
They talk about was captured by ISIS and Michelle Obama with the standing of

63
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.190
alcohol anchors, all these people in the mainstream,

64
00:03:44.191 --> 00:03:47.880
standing up for a lot of girls and like human trafficking issues.

65
00:03:47.881 --> 00:03:52.710
But nobody here in like West wants to talk about North Korea because

66
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.420
that offsets Chinese region.

67
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.810
<v 2>Is it? Yeah. Is that crazy for you?</v>

68
00:03:57.811 --> 00:04:02.610
Like you come here and you see this sort of fear around

69
00:04:02.611 --> 00:04:05.970
talking, not, not just about North Korea, but we talked about this a little,

70
00:04:05.971 --> 00:04:08.820
a little bit, a couple of weeks ago, just that you see the way we,

71
00:04:08.821 --> 00:04:11.790
we are afraid of speaking up here in the freest country,

72
00:04:11.791 --> 00:04:13.290
in the world about whatever it might be.

73
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.920
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, that's like, that's so shocking to me.</v>

74
00:04:16.921 --> 00:04:21.060
Like I thought America was like land of the free, the home of the brave way.

75
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.570
That's like how I thought of this country to be in coming here.

76
00:04:24.571 --> 00:04:25.980
And like the movies,

77
00:04:25.981 --> 00:04:29.160
when they make a one North Korea to expulsion the dictatorship,

78
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.190
the Hallyu like drop the sponsorship.

79
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.830
And there's no way I can like talk about it because there's Kim Jong-un can

80
00:04:37.831 --> 00:04:41.460
never exist without Chinese comments, parts of sponsorship.

81
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.040
There's no way he can be dictated right now.

82
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.540
And he's improving 25 millions of people and the United nations,

83
00:04:48.541 --> 00:04:50.610
they are saying only resemblance.

84
00:04:50.611 --> 00:04:53.730
We can see what's happening to North Korean people is a Holocaust.

85
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.070
That's what cause it happening again,

86
00:04:56.071 --> 00:05:00.390
North Korea and the words denying your game and the mainstream, of course,

87
00:05:00.391 --> 00:05:04.170
Hollywood and media, because they don't want to like upset China.

88
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.060
<v 2>Yeah. I mean, is it that obvious? Like, it's that they just,</v>

89
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.410
Hollywood just wants Chinese dollars. The last transformers movie, you know,

90
00:05:13.411 --> 00:05:15.000
they really want it to push to China.

91
00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:18.000
So they fill in part of it there and they put all the products and all that kind

92
00:05:18.001 --> 00:05:19.650
of stuff. I mean, is it really that simple?

93
00:05:19.651 --> 00:05:22.590
It just comes down to money and they see a new market there and that's it.

94
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.010
<v 0>So that's like what? I only recall.</v>

95
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.090
I discovered last few years that I've been, keep trying to talk to people.

96
00:05:30.091 --> 00:05:33.570
And then as soon as I talk about the, my spoon, China is being, you know,

97
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.240
human trafficking, all of that. They were like, Oh,

98
00:05:36.241 --> 00:05:40.740
I cannot put my name on that. And so yeah, in those everyone's like, Oh,

99
00:05:40.741 --> 00:05:43.140
I cannot, like, I, I care about what you do, but like,

100
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.450
I can never like support you on this.

101
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.260
And they have no problem supporting like a lot of other causes.

102
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.520
And also though I work, I mean, my movie has been trying to make,

103
00:05:53.521 --> 00:05:55.860
and other movies were being made already.

104
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.180
And this production companies gave him money.

105
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.290
And then as soon as they were like appreciated by like these other platforms,

106
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:06.470
they just drop the sponsorship and there's like, I can not show this movie.

107
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.090
<v 2>And when you see, like, you know, there was the big controversy,</v>

108
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.440
six or seven months ago with the NBA players that would in criticize China.

109
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.400
And yet they'll tell you how racist and everything else America is. It must,

110
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:19.600
it must just blow your mind.

111
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.750
<v 0>I mean, but even though it blew my mind,</v>

112
00:06:22.751 --> 00:06:27.160
I couldn't speak out because I was scared. You know, like, they're gonna, what,

113
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.650
how am I gonna, like, I need to fight for my people.

114
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.370
What if all these countries, and I make me a CIS spy and blah, blah, blah,

115
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:34.900
you know, being a racist, all of that.

116
00:06:34.901 --> 00:06:37.480
Like how do I even get a chance to fight for my people?

117
00:06:37.481 --> 00:06:42.190
Maybe I still need to be like somehow being acceptable to them.

118
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.360
But like, and real, I was robbed in Chicago this year,

119
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.920
during the summer mast. And I was punched by these two black women.

120
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.840
And then in, and then I was trying to ask them like, can you, like,

121
00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.370
I was asking people to have lunch too.

122
00:06:57.371 --> 00:07:01.380
She was punching me and taking my wallet away. And these people were studying,

123
00:07:01.381 --> 00:07:05.770
calling me a racist, like this, like middle of the Chicago, Michigan Avenue.

124
00:07:05.771 --> 00:07:09.100
I still have a footage of the scars. And the second you are racist,

125
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.470
you're a bad person. While you're doing this, like color scheme,

126
00:07:11.471 --> 00:07:15.640
doesn't make them fav. I was like, I mean, I have nanny was Muslim and he job,

127
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.790
like, I'm going to call her a person. Like, why would I do that?

128
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.520
And of course those girls worked.

129
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.830
If the police got the fridge over them using my credit card,

130
00:07:23.831 --> 00:07:28.030
spending $3,000 at programming and like rooming there or something.

131
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:34.360
And I just couldn't believe like the people were seeing me this,

132
00:07:34.361 --> 00:07:35.950
I was very petty. As you saw me,

133
00:07:35.951 --> 00:07:40.150
this big three black women were like pushing me to the car and punching me.

134
00:07:40.151 --> 00:07:42.190
And then district calling me a racist and like,

135
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.700
they're holding me down so they can run away so I can not call the police on

136
00:07:45.701 --> 00:07:49.360
them. And that was like, Oh my gosh,

137
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.910
I cannot believe that I have a son in this country. Like,

138
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.870
this is not a safe country anymore. Like, things are not like,

139
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.010
okay anymore.

140
00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:01.300
<v 2>So what, what do you make about what's happening in the United States?</v>

141
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.930
Cause one of the things we were talking about a couple of weeks ago is that the

142
00:08:04.931 --> 00:08:09.310
chill around free speech that just people are, you said to me,

143
00:08:09.311 --> 00:08:12.160
I think this is exactly what you said, but correct me if I'm wrong. I mean,

144
00:08:12.161 --> 00:08:16.900
you said this is right now feeling like what it felt like.

145
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.120
I know this feeling.

146
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.850
<v 0>I, before I say always,</v>

147
00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:26.530
I get like first thing my mom taught me was not even whisper because the first

148
00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:30.670
and my school hear me in North Korea. And now I'm same thing.

149
00:08:30.671 --> 00:08:35.410
Like trying to teaching my son. Like when you cross the, like, what, what grade?

150
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.350
And do you know, like crosswalk there's like white men,

151
00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:42.250
like walking sign and he's like, we are, so of course he was like light color.

152
00:08:42.251 --> 00:08:44.530
And man, like he says a white man, I can walk.

153
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.920
And people are looking at him as like, you can not say you're, I cannot,

154
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.880
I'm like always teaching him to be how not to be attacked. And like,

155
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:56.460
this is exactly my mom did to me. Like I just like,

156
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:02.190
and what also, what I see in America is that when I was going North Korea,

157
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.740
I was like third generation of this oppression.

158
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:09.990
I didn't even know what the alternative was like, but my grandmother knew,

159
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.770
like she was living under the Japanese colonization before Kim,

160
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:18.180
she lived her life and people at the time who knew what was different

161
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.600
