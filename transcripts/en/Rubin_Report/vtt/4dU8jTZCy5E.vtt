00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.570
<v 0>They don't forgive because there's nothing to forgive because I'm stuck.</v>

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.220
I'm stuck in the oppressor group.

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.430
If I'm stuck in the oppressor group and there's no escaping it,

4
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.220
there can be no forgiveness if there's no repentance, right?

5
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.290
Like isn't that how it works so that I'm just perpetually a sinner and I'm just

6
00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:19.140
going to continue to perpetuate the oppressor group.

7
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.550
And there's nothing that I can do.

8
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.450
<v 2>It's an impossible, uh,</v>

9
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.960
place to put yourself because you're trying to hold something.

10
00:00:35.961 --> 00:00:40.130
You're trying to be open. You're trying to retain ideas and,

11
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.510
and also not put people down. It's tough. W what do you make of this idea?

12
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.310
So you hit on that, that critical theory, whatever cultural, Marxism,

13
00:00:49.311 --> 00:00:52.430
whatever you want to call, the thing that it's religious in nature. One of the,

14
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.380
one of the facets that I'm constantly amazed by is there's no forgiveness in

15
00:00:57.381 --> 00:01:01.940
this thing that basically, if you're white or you're cis-gendered,

16
00:01:01.941 --> 00:01:05.900
or you're Christian, or whatever, you're privileged and thus bad,

17
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.960
and that really, you just have to pay penance your whole life.

18
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.700
You have to live on your knees, your whole life,

19
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.980
where most religions have some level of forgiveness, right.

20
00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:20.000
You can actually atone for your sins and hopefully be a better person on the

21
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:23.720
other side. This thing doesn't have that this thing has, Oh,

22
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.600
well live like a slave forever in effect.

23
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.370
<v 0>Right? Yeah. A hundred percent. So, so in,</v>

24
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.680
in critical theory, you're sort of guilty, um,

25
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.940
you know, before proven innocent. Um, so everybody's guilty.

26
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.250
Um, and as James Lindsay, you know, as, as observed and in,

27
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.200
in his findings, um,

28
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.730
all of the critical theorists believe essentially that if you will, even, even,

29
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.421
you know, for example,

30
00:01:53.421 --> 00:01:56.780
if I want to be somebody accused me of problematic Alex yesterday,

31
00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.480
but that's the whole point,

32
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.520
the whole point is that I can never be truly an ally. My,

33
00:02:03.521 --> 00:02:07.910
my allyship is always going to be problematic. Um, there's, you know, like,

34
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.600
so there's no, there's no, there's no end to it.

35
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.310
It just continues to be what it is. So,

36
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.190
uh, yeah, they, they,

37
00:02:19.191 --> 00:02:22.760
they don't forgive because there's nothing to forgive because I'm stuck.

38
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.380
I'm stuck in the oppressor group.

39
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.590
If I'm stuck in the oppressor group and there's no escaping it,

40
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.950
there can be no forgiveness if there's no repentance, right. Like,

41
00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:32.090
isn't that how it works,

42
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.170
so that I'm just perpetually a sinner and I'm just going to continue to

43
00:02:36.171 --> 00:02:40.400
perpetuate the oppressor group. And there's nothing that I can do. Yeah.

44
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.750
So that's why, of course,

45
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.130
CA cancel culture is actually the logical conclusion of critical theory,

46
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.240
right?

47
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.010
It's the logical conclusion that to be consistent logically they have

48
00:02:52.011 --> 00:02:53.030
to, uh,

49
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.450
be consistent in their cancel culture because they have to get rid of the

50
00:02:56.451 --> 00:03:00.250
oppressor class. I hate to you. I think it's beheadings.

51
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.510
<v 2>Is the logical conclusion. Cancel culture is just cancel.</v>

52
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.470
Culture is just a stop on the way,

53
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.450
but we can sort of leave that just for you personally, dealing with this, um,

54
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.480
the idea that everything's become political. And in many ways,

55
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:18.400
I think people used to go to have religious experiences regardless of the

56
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:21.400
religion, they would go there to escape politics that,

57
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.060
that religion sort of offered them that, you know,

58
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.290
that separation from the real world to think of something timeless,

59
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.940
something like that, um,

60
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.750
to see it all seep in just for you as a leader of a community.

61
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.640
<v 0>How's that been on you? Um,</v>

62
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.650
yeah, so, so, so one of the things that I do, um,

63
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.210
in my role is I traveled to a number of churches. I, I don't, I'm like,

64
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.690
I'm not the lead pastor, um, in a, in a community,

65
00:03:51.691 --> 00:03:54.530
but I go to all of the different communities. Um, and I,

66
00:03:54.531 --> 00:03:59.250
I speak at a number of churches. And so what is it, what is it like? Well, um,

67
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.450
yeah, people are, people don't get church.

68
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.520
It's supposed to be a place where they like,

69
00:04:05.521 --> 00:04:09.720
hear about the love of God for them. And they hear about the sacrifice that,

70
00:04:09.721 --> 00:04:14.520
you know, and, and they, they re uh, remember the Lord's, um,

71
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.140
passion, et cetera. And so it's kind of become in some circles,

72
00:04:19.141 --> 00:04:20.100
in some churches,

73
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.720
the gospel has totally become about current events.

74
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.640
Um, and I think that that's definitely problematic. Um,

75
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.910
you know, it, it, it, it definitely become problematic where, where, um,

76
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.980
in Christianity we teach essentially that everybody's a priest. In fact,

77
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.140
um, the Protestant reformation happened because one of, you know,

78
00:04:46.141 --> 00:04:49.710
Martin Luther's 95 problems with the Catholic church was that you had to have a

79
00:04:49.711 --> 00:04:51.360
priest to connect with God.

80
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.960
And the new Testament is replete with scriptures about the priesthood of the

81
00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:55.794
believer.

82
00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.110
And so what this necessarily means for Protestants like me is that every

83
00:05:01.111 --> 00:05:04.040
believer is supposedly coming to church to be appraised.

84
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.570
It's what you literally do is you come to what a priest do.

85
00:05:06.571 --> 00:05:08.310
They administer the Lord and they minister to others.

86
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.110
But like when you come to church and it's a lesson on critical theory,

87
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.030
you know, and there's like, there's no escape. Um,

88
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.140
I think that people aren't able to do their job as a Christian. Uh,

89
00:05:22.141 --> 00:05:23.580
I think that, that, it's,

90
00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:27.570
it's really tough to glorify God and to worship God when it's like, you're in a,

91
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.320
you're in a perpetual classroom, and there's just doubt and there's confusion.

92
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.710
And,

93
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.740
and I think that one of my biggest frustrations for me is that I don't think

94
00:05:34.741 --> 00:05:38.850
that a lot of church leaders have their pulse on this epistemological issue.

95
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.550
So it's just, it's washing it.

96
00:05:41.551 --> 00:05:44.790
Like pastors are good people and they love people.

97
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.980
And so from that good place of going, I love people. They're probably going,

98
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.380
we need to talk about this because this, this is a real pig. This is, this is,

99
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.850
this is where the rubber hits the road, but problematically, if you're not you,

100
00:05:56.851 --> 00:06:00.170
don't your pulse on culture and understanding,

101
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.560
and the undercurrents epistemologically, you know, you're,

102
00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:05.540
you're creating a lot of confusion for people.

103
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:08.300
So that's absolutely what's happening. Do you think.

104
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.120
<v 2>Certain religious denominations and certain sex within religions are just</v>

105
00:06:13.121 --> 00:06:16.420
better at keeping some of this stuff at Bay?

106
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.800
So it seems to me it's not perfect, but like something like Orthodox Jews,

107
00:06:20.801 --> 00:06:21.281
let's say,

108
00:06:21.281 --> 00:06:25.780
have really kept this at Bay in a way that conservative or reformed Jews haven't

109
00:06:25.781 --> 00:06:26.614
been able to,

110
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.450
or evangelicals I think have done a pretty good job at keeping it at Bay. Um,

111
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.810
do you think that there are like certain strengths and weaknesses from a

112
00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:36.520
Protestant perspective or, uh,

113
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.410
or another denomination perspective that makes certain worldviews a little more

114
00:06:41.411 --> 00:06:42.880
able to stand up to these?

115
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.770
<v 0>Absolutely. So it's a focus. Um, it's a focus on,</v>

116
00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.660
on their purpose. Like why does, why do Orthodox Jews exist? Right.

117
00:06:52.661 --> 00:06:57.070
Like they know why. Um, and I mean, look,

118
00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.700
break down sometimes to the way that they dress, like they're in this world,

119
00:07:00.701 --> 00:07:05.050
but they're not of this world, sort of this Jesus said. Um, and so I think that,

120
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.690
that they do a really great job, you know,

121
00:07:07.691 --> 00:07:12.280
of like focusing on their community and focusing on the reasons why they

122
00:07:12.281 --> 00:07:17.050
exist. Um, so there's a, there is a definitely a bounce to be.

123
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.630
We'll see what I look at Jesus. And it's just, once again,

124
00:07:19.631 --> 00:07:22.810
this isn't a political epistemological issue, but when I look at Jesus,

125
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.290
I don't look at somebody who is necessarily engaged in the politics of this day.

126
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.410
I think that, you know, Jesus said, my kingdom is not of this world.

127
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:34.210
And so he had a little bit of a I'm in the world, but I'm not of it.

128
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:40.000
Um, does that mean that we don't engage in issues of justice? No.

129
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.140
Doesn't mean that we don't,

130
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:46.030
I think that marching with Martin Luther King was the right thing to do,

131
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.060
um, during the civil rights and, and, um, you know, uh,

132
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.970
I think that defeating Hitler was probably a good thing to do. Um, you know,

133
00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:02.170
like, so there's, there's, I think that the church doesn't run from things,

134
00:08:02.171 --> 00:08:04.090
but it's, it's finding,

135
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.400
it's sifting through the things that we should engage in.

136
00:08:06.401 --> 00:08:08.380
How would you engage in the threshold of that?

137
00:08:08.381 --> 00:08:11.830
And it's a conversation that we're having right now. And, uh, yeah,

138
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:16.330
evangelicals probably have done a really great job because evangelicals are a

139
00:08:16.331 --> 00:08:19.150
bit more heady. Pentecostals are probably a bit more,

140
00:08:19.151 --> 00:08:22.510
we lean a bit more experiential. Um,

141
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:26.940
and so I'm, uh, um, that's, you know, I,

142
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:31.930
I wish that Pentecostals were a bit more likely than Angelicals and, and, uh,

143
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.980
in that they, they sifted, they had their, you know, like Albert Mohler,

144
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:36.611
you know,

145
00:08:36.611 --> 00:08:40.450
he he's the president of the Southern Baptist convention and he set out,

146
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.800
he sent out a letter on critical theory to all of the pastors. And, but,

147
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:48.370
Hey guys, this is what's happening. Like, but Pentecostals is a bit of the wild,

148
00:08:48.371 --> 00:08:52.510
wild West and in Christianity, um, I don't know if you knew this,

149
00:08:52.511 --> 00:08:56.970
but we've only been around for 120 years and we, uh,

150
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.590
there's 750 million of us,

151
00:08:58.591 --> 00:09:02.810
and we're the fastest growing version of Christianity in the world. Like, we're,

152
00:09:02.811 --> 00:09:07.680
we're going to clips, we're going to clips Catholicism in 50 years. Um,

153
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.210
so, um,

154
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:13.770
so our brand of Christianity in terms of filling stadiums and people singing our

155
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:17.190
songs and all this stuff, it's, uh, it's, it's a big place. And it's like,

156
00:09:17.191 --> 00:09:20.730
it is the battleground for Christian expression.

157
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:25.110
And that finding that threshold of where politics are and what Christianity is

158
00:09:25.111 --> 00:09:29.520
going to look like, et cetera. So Pentecostals don't, we don't have, um,

159
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.570
we don't have like, uh, uh, a grand Poobah, like an Albert Mohler,

160
00:09:33.571 --> 00:09:37.620
or like a Jerry foul or whatever who kind of

161
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.570
dictates to us or will tell us, Hey guys, this is what's coming up. We're,

162
00:09:41.571 --> 00:09:45.150
we're very, very much independent. So because of that,

163
00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:47.490
because the nature of that, and because we're so experientials,

164
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.160
and because we're so kind of up on the culture,

165
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.480
it's a mess right now, but nobody knows what to believe,

166
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:56.280
but we know that people are hurting.

167
00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.270
And so we're going to run towards people because we're experiential and people

168
00:10:00.271 --> 00:10:02.850
are having these experiences. So we're going to love them.

169
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.660
But that's the rational part of our compassion seems to be a bit missing.

170
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.590
And we're unawares to what is really inside this Trojan horse.
