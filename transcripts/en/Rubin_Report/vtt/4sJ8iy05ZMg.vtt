1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.380
<v 0>Yeah, absolutely.</v>

2
00:00:01.381 --> 00:00:04.680
So it was a little bit funny because after of course the Trump rally,

3
00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:09.030
about a month later, the pandemic really hit and not too long after that we had,

4
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.760
um, George, the George Floyd incident in Minneapolis.

5
00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:16.620
And after that critical race theory really started taking over my entire

6
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.641
industry.

7
00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:20.940
I had just been doing trainings with organizations about how to be better

8
00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:24.100
managers and how to communicate with each other and interpersonal communication,

9
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.590
all that good stuff. Well,

10
00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:29.850
critical race theory came in and took over absolutely every single thing.

11
00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:34.170
And the results that I've seen have just really they've emphasized why critical

12
00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:37.680
race theory is not a good direction to go. And it's harming individuals.

13
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:40.950
It's harming team cohesion, it's harming organizational productivity,

14
00:00:40.951 --> 00:00:44.610
and yet organizations all over the country are spending thousands,

15
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.450
tens of thousands.

16
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.680
Some of them millions of dollars on this training that has absolutely no

17
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:52.350
foundational evidence to support its effectiveness.

18
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.170
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

19
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.970
<v 2>It's locals.</v>

20
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.420
We hear on the Rubin report and I'm doing a series of mini interviews with

21
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:12.800
creators on why they decided to become less reliant on big tech and instead

22
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.270
owned their content community and livelihood with locals.com.

23
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.280
Joining me today is an organizational therapist and knitter turned fearless

24
00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:26.390
political fighter Carlin. Borysenko welcome back to the Rubin report.

25
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.573
Thanks for having me.

26
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.170
I am glad to have you back on because although we're going to talk obviously a

27
00:01:33.171 --> 00:01:35.360
bit about locals and why you're on there,

28
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.310
you really have become sort of a fearless political fighter. And a year ago,

29
00:01:40.311 --> 00:01:43.400
you weren't in this game at all.

30
00:01:43.401 --> 00:01:47.210
You were a simple private person, a knitter,

31
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.470
and now look at you.

32
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.170
<v 0>You know, life is funny, Dave,</v>

33
00:01:51.171 --> 00:01:53.240
you never quite know what it's going to throw at you, but, um,

34
00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:55.130
it's been a wild ride and I'm enjoying it.

35
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.380
<v 2>Yeah. So for people that don't know, you we'll,</v>

36
00:01:57.381 --> 00:02:00.500
we'll link to the full interview that we did below. And in effect,

37
00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:04.460
you went to a Trump rally thinking you were going to be at a white supremacist

38
00:02:04.461 --> 00:02:04.971
rally,

39
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:07.790
and it turned out that you were surrounded by a lot of nice people and now

40
00:02:07.791 --> 00:02:12.410
you've become a big part of the walkway campaign and the rest of it. Um,

41
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.100
how are you feeling about the world at the moment?

42
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.760
<v 0>You know, I mean, it is touch and go, isn't it,</v>

43
00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:24.050
there are some days I'm like we are all incredibly tuned and there are some days

44
00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:25.420
that the, yeah,

45
00:02:25.421 --> 00:02:28.790
I just have so much faith and confidence in the direction that we're going in.

46
00:02:28.791 --> 00:02:31.520
You know, I've been traveling around the country for the past couple of months,

47
00:02:31.521 --> 00:02:34.850
doing walkaway rallies all over the place that I've gotten to meet so many

48
00:02:34.851 --> 00:02:37.190
amazing people. I've gotten to meet a lot of conservatives,

49
00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:37.911
a lot of Republicans,

50
00:02:37.911 --> 00:02:42.350
but also a lot of people just like us who have walked away from the left and you

51
00:02:42.351 --> 00:02:44.660
know, their, their energy. And it's just,

52
00:02:44.661 --> 00:02:48.110
it's a different vibe when you're in the walkaway community, everyone is happy.

53
00:02:48.111 --> 00:02:51.290
It's like a burden has been lifted off your shoulders. And I love it.

54
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.030
<v 2>What's interesting to me is that you're not just like the average person</v>

55
00:02:56.031 --> 00:03:00.730
walking away, but, but in many ways, your job as an organizational therapist is,

56
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.510
is sort of tied to why you're walking away. Can you explain that a little bit?

57
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.750
<v 0>Yeah, absolutely.</v>

58
00:03:06.751 --> 00:03:10.050
So it was a little bit funny because after of course the Trump rally,

59
00:03:10.051 --> 00:03:14.430
about a month later, the pandemic really hit and not too long after that we had,

60
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.130
um, George, the George Floyd incident in Minneapolis.

61
00:03:17.131 --> 00:03:22.020
And after that critical race theory really started taking over my entire

62
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.011
industry.

63
00:03:23.011 --> 00:03:26.310
I had just been doing trainings with organizations about how to be better

64
00:03:26.311 --> 00:03:29.510
managers and how to communicate with each other and interpersonal communication,

65
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.960
all that good stuff. Well,

66
00:03:30.961 --> 00:03:35.250
critical race theory came in and took over absolutely every single thing.

67
00:03:35.251 --> 00:03:39.540
And the results that I've seen have just really they've emphasized why critical

68
00:03:39.541 --> 00:03:43.080
race theory is not a good direction to go in. It's harming individuals,

69
00:03:43.081 --> 00:03:46.320
it's harming team cohesion, it's harming organizational productivity.

70
00:03:46.321 --> 00:03:49.980
And yet organizations all over the country are spending thousands,

71
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.843
tens of thousands.

72
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.080
Some of them millions of dollars on this training that has absolutely no

73
00:03:55.081 --> 00:03:57.720
foundational evidence to support its effectiveness.

74
00:03:57.721 --> 00:04:01.680
And so that's really where I've been focusing on in the past couple of months is

75
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.150
fighting back against this monster that has taken over and really is doing a lot

76
00:04:06.151 --> 00:04:08.130
of harm to individuals and organizations.

77
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.030
<v 2>And you've done a really great job of sort of mapping how you can stand up to</v>

78
00:04:12.031 --> 00:04:14.100
the mob and still survive because you talk about it.

79
00:04:14.101 --> 00:04:18.270
You've lost jobs because of this, but at the same time, you've got,

80
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.710
I'm guessing thousands of people reaching out to you telling you, Oh,

81
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.960
this stuff, this critical race theory stuff, it's,

82
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.220
it's leaking into my organization. How do I fight it and everything else?

83
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.780
<v 0>Yeah, that's absolutely true. I've definitely been canceled by clients,</v>

84
00:04:33.781 --> 00:04:36.390
but I've also gotten clients in return. And you know,

85
00:04:36.391 --> 00:04:40.860
really where I'm at right now is I just want to help people understand why this

86
00:04:40.861 --> 00:04:44.070
philosophy is so dangerous because it's one of those things that, you know,

87
00:04:44.071 --> 00:04:47.910
one of the reasons it is so dangerous is because people don't understand it,

88
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.960
organizations that are implementing it, do not understand exactly what it means.

89
00:04:51.961 --> 00:04:56.040
And so if we can help debunk what's going on and really help people, uh,

90
00:04:56.041 --> 00:04:57.870
approach it in a more, um,

91
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.620
in a more simple way where you can just get to the core issue of why this stuff

92
00:05:01.621 --> 00:05:02.454
is dangerous,

93
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.790
then you can help them to understand and then fight back in their own lives.

94
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.700
<v 2>Yeah. So you fighting back on this and, you know,</v>

95
00:05:08.701 --> 00:05:12.090
having jobs canceled and I know all too well,

96
00:05:12.091 --> 00:05:16.080
the stories of what happens in a personal life and, uh, just earlier today,

97
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.160
as we were tweeting like fools, so the trolls were going after you,

98
00:05:20.161 --> 00:05:22.650
and you said you were eating your sushi, lunch and smiling.

99
00:05:22.651 --> 00:05:25.290
So I myself had a sushi lunch, uh,

100
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.520
but that's sort of a good segue to why you're on locals because when we started

101
00:05:29.521 --> 00:05:34.440
locals, my initial idea was I want to find people who are

102
00:05:34.441 --> 00:05:36.690
doing good work, doing something valuable,

103
00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:40.920
but could still be crushed by big tech at any moment.

104
00:05:40.921 --> 00:05:44.490
And the stuff that you're doing, which, which is true and decent and important,

105
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.060
the, the big tech people ain't that thrilled with those ideas?

106
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.590
<v 0>No, they're, they're not, it was funny because right after I was on your show,</v>

107
00:05:52.591 --> 00:05:54.630
the first time I started a Facebook group,

108
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.310
basically trying to have civil discourse among people who disagreed with each

109
00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:00.470
other and that group is still around and it's still going,

110
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.530
but almost immediately upon starting that group,

111
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.530
it became very clear that Facebook was going to censor it and they would just

112
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:10.370
randomly delete things that frankly had no, there was no problem with it.

113
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:13.280
If someone was just asking a question that Facebook deemed out of bounds,

114
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.160
they would just delete it out of nowhere and then I'd get a notification.

115
00:06:16.161 --> 00:06:19.730
And so I was really freaking out that one day I was just going to wake up and

116
00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:22.520
this group was going to be gone. And so you kind of reached out to me and said,

117
00:06:22.521 --> 00:06:26.210
well, bring it on to locals and you don't have to worry about that anymore.

118
00:06:26.211 --> 00:06:27.860
And so that's exactly what I'm trying to.

119
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.320
<v 2>And congratulations, it's your community. You can regulate it or not regulated.</v>

120
00:06:32.321 --> 00:06:33.670
It has nothing to do with me.

121
00:06:33.671 --> 00:06:35.590
It actually doesn't really have anything to do with the locals.

122
00:06:35.591 --> 00:06:38.210
People were just giving you the tools to do that. So what,

123
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:42.100
what are you doing on locals that you can't do as easily when,

124
00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:44.590
when you're on Facebook or Twitter or elsewhere?

125
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:46.773
<v 0>Well, you know, I mean,</v>

126
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.470
know what's great about locals is it's like the adult community. I mean,

127
00:06:50.471 --> 00:06:52.900
we were talking about how we were dealing with all these trolls on Twitter

128
00:06:52.901 --> 00:06:54.850
today. Twitter is not the adult community.

129
00:06:54.851 --> 00:06:56.840
You don't go on Twitter to have adult conversation,

130
00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.510
plug Twitter to exactly. And it can be fun and all that stuff.

131
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.900
But if you want to have adult conversations, you need an Avenue to do that.

132
00:07:04.901 --> 00:07:08.260
And even Facebook that's, it gets really hard to do it on there.

133
00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:12.220
But what I love about locals is that people are self-selecting into this

134
00:07:12.221 --> 00:07:12.791
community.

135
00:07:12.791 --> 00:07:16.810
There's that little barrier of having to pay like five bucks a month to join the

136
00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:18.160
platform so that you,

137
00:07:18.161 --> 00:07:21.430
you tend to get people that are much more interested in actually having those

138
00:07:21.431 --> 00:07:24.940
adult conversations. And it's just so nice. It's so calm.

139
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.160
And no one has to worry about being canceled.

140
00:07:27.161 --> 00:07:30.340
You don't have to worry about being banned at a moment's notice because someone

141
00:07:30.341 --> 00:07:33.130
at Twitter or Facebook, doesn't like what you're saying, it's just, it's,

142
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.100
it's a relief is the best way I can think to describe a little bit. Yeah.

143
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.460
<v 2>Have you had any crazy people in there? I mean,</v>

144
00:07:39.461 --> 00:07:43.690
has anyone decided I'm going to pay her money so that I can be mean nobody does

145
00:07:43.691 --> 00:07:44.524
it right.

146
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.070
<v 0>Well, I'm sure you just gave them the idea to do that. So thanks a lot. Bye.</v>

147
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.460
<v 2>I made you a couple of bucks and then you have to decide if you want to keep</v>

148
00:07:51.461 --> 00:07:53.050
them cause it's up to you.

149
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:57.460
<v 0>Exactly. But to your point, no, that absolutely hasn't happened yet.</v>

150
00:07:57.461 --> 00:07:58.810
And you know, in my locals community,

151
00:07:58.811 --> 00:08:02.470
we actually do weekly zoom calls with all of my local supporters.

152
00:08:02.471 --> 00:08:03.850
We actually get on just like this.

153
00:08:03.851 --> 00:08:06.370
And we chat with each other and someone even said last week,

154
00:08:06.371 --> 00:08:08.890
they were afraid were like, I don't know if I'm going to vote for Trump.

155
00:08:08.891 --> 00:08:11.260
And I'm afraid I'm going to get kicked out of the group was like, no,

156
00:08:11.261 --> 00:08:13.150
you're not going to get kicked out of the group. Just come in,

157
00:08:13.151 --> 00:08:16.270
be a reasonable human being. That's really all we asked for.

158
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.330
<v 2>Interesting how just a couple, a couple bucks,</v>

159
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:24.490
we'll kind of keep the, you know, riff-raff out, you know?

160
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.380
Yeah.

161
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.240
<v 0>Yeah. And it just makes it nicer for everyone.</v>

162
00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:31.420
It's not only nicer for me as the person running the community,

163
00:08:31.421 --> 00:08:33.370
it's nicer for everyone else there.

164
00:08:33.371 --> 00:08:37.360
And it allows people a way to develop those genuine human relationships.

165
00:08:37.361 --> 00:08:39.130
And it's just been really, really fantastic. Yeah.

166
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.960
<v 2>So when you're fighting the mob,</v>

167
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:44.500
I think I asked you a version of this question about a year ago when we first

168
00:08:44.501 --> 00:08:46.150
sat down or maybe it wasn't even that long ago,

169
00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:48.700
time is very strange these days since COVID, it's like,

170
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:52.420
did that happen yesterday or four years ago? I'm not sure. Um, but,

171
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.460
but what is it about you,

172
00:08:54.461 --> 00:08:58.560
do you think that lets you be brave in these very strange times?

173
00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:02.490
Because I think the reason you've made a Mark suddenly is people are like, Oh,

174
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:06.510
that girl is saying what she thinks. And so many people are afraid to do it.

175
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:07.860
Some guy wrote a book about that.

176
00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.920
<v 0>He did, he did. And we're actually reading that book in my community right now.</v>

177
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:17.660
Um, but you know, I think what, what for me is, I mean, frankly,

178
00:09:17.661 --> 00:09:21.290
what is lacking among so many of the people that we see out protesting that all

179
00:09:21.291 --> 00:09:25.250
want these safe spaces is I've had to overcome a lot of challenges in my life,

180
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.520
from my family to different, you know, bullies I've met in my life.

181
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.760
And I think that when you overcome challenges like that,

182
00:09:31.761 --> 00:09:35.330
it sets you up to take on things that are just simply, you know, that are,

183
00:09:35.331 --> 00:09:36.380
that are much more important.

184
00:09:36.381 --> 00:09:40.400
So I think that I've developed the resiliency from having to overcome things

185
00:09:40.401 --> 00:09:43.730
throughout my life, that I don't mind standing up on a stage and saying,

186
00:09:43.731 --> 00:09:43.941
you know,

187
00:09:43.941 --> 00:09:46.760
this is what I think this is why I walked away from the democratic party.

188
00:09:46.761 --> 00:09:49.190
And some people are going to like it and some people are going to hate it.

189
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.950
And that's just the way it is. But I also think that there's,

190
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.090
there's something to being in this every day. Isn't there is that when you,

191
00:09:56.091 --> 00:09:57.590
when you have the hate come at you,

192
00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.140
it's a pattern and you can see that no matter what you say,

193
00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:01.070
no matter what you do,

194
00:10:01.071 --> 00:10:04.910
the hate comes in exactly the same way as incredibly predictable.

195
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.170
And so after a while,

196
00:10:06.171 --> 00:10:08.840
you start to realize that has nothing to do with you at all.

197
00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:12.290
It has to do with them and where they're at and the goals that they have and

198
00:10:12.291 --> 00:10:14.990
trying to achieve those goals by any means necessary.

199
00:10:14.991 --> 00:10:18.350
So I can't take it personally. It's not about me. It's about them. Yeah.

200
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:22.010
<v 2>It's funny. I had a tweet that was catching fire today and I had a very,</v>

201
00:10:22.011 --> 00:10:23.780
very minor typo in it.

202
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:28.700
And I had like hundreds of these trolls, you know, did you have a stroke?

203
00:10:28.701 --> 00:10:31.790
Are you retarded? Like stuff that's much worse than that. And it's like,

204
00:10:31.791 --> 00:10:35.030
I don't really care about that. Um, but it's like, wait a minute.

205
00:10:35.031 --> 00:10:38.360
I thought you guys were the tolerant good people. Um,

206
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:42.950
but maybe not as tolerant and good as you say,

207
00:10:42.951 --> 00:10:47.710
you are, something like that. Um, where do you sense, uh, your,

208
00:10:47.711 --> 00:10:48.820
your community going? What,

209
00:10:48.821 --> 00:10:51.980
what's the goal and how do you stay out of the echo chamber? I mean,

210
00:10:51.981 --> 00:10:55.280
one of the things that I'm trying to figure out with my own community is that,

211
00:10:55.281 --> 00:10:57.800
you know, people are paying a couple of bucks to get in. So you're,

212
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.770
self-selecting a certain amount of people. And, and I know for people like us,

213
00:11:00.771 --> 00:11:02.870
we don't want it to be just like-minded people.

214
00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:06.080
And I love seeing people interact with each other and agree to disagree.

215
00:11:06.081 --> 00:11:08.420
But how do you, how do you guard against that?

216
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.420
<v 0>You know,</v>

217
00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:14.300
I really want to have more constructive discussion and constructive debate in my

218
00:11:14.301 --> 00:11:14.781
community.

219
00:11:14.781 --> 00:11:18.800
One of the things that I found is that it is incredibly hard to get people who

220
00:11:18.801 --> 00:11:22.250
are not Trump supporters or people on the right to join the community.

221
00:11:22.251 --> 00:11:24.890
We do have lefties in there and I'm grateful that they're in there and I'm

222
00:11:24.891 --> 00:11:27.980
grateful for their contribution, but I really want to see more of them.

223
00:11:27.981 --> 00:11:31.250
So one of the things I want to do when I have a little downtime after the

224
00:11:31.251 --> 00:11:35.000
election is I want to start doing more constructive discussions.

225
00:11:35.001 --> 00:11:36.410
I want to start a debate club.

226
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.840
I actually want to have a debate club where people get assigned to their

227
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:40.760
position so they don't get to choose them.

228
00:11:40.761 --> 00:11:42.710
So sometimes they might have to argue positions.

229
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.100
They don't agree with just to understand the other side. Um,

230
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:49.520
and I think it's very important for people to demonstrate that they're capable

231
00:11:49.521 --> 00:11:53.620
of having adult conversations and walking away and being like it's okay to it's.

232
00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:55.030
Okay. We're all going to survive.

233
00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:57.510
<v 2>Weird to be one of the adults in the room. When,</v>

234
00:11:57.511 --> 00:11:59.520
when there aren't as many adults in the room, isn't it.

235
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:02.190
<v 0>I'll tell you if you looked at my Twitter,</v>

236
00:12:02.191 --> 00:12:04.140
you would not think I was one of the adults in the room,

237
00:12:04.141 --> 00:12:06.150
but I do really try to be in real life.

238
00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:10.620
<v 2>Well, I don't know what, I don't know what it says about the state of adulthood.</v>

239
00:12:10.621 --> 00:12:13.740
Like I'm making as many star Wars GI Joe references.

240
00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:17.040
And yet somehow I'm an adult in the room that th that's not because of me,

241
00:12:17.041 --> 00:12:18.720
that's mostly because of these people.

242
00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:23.010
<v 0>Well, I mean, that's a reflection of where the people were fighting at.</v>

243
00:12:23.011 --> 00:12:25.590
Are aren't they? Because of where the adults in the room. I mean, they're,

244
00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:28.260
they're like, they're the kindergarteners in the room, aren't they?

245
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.670
<v 2>All right. So one more question for you.</v>

246
00:12:29.671 --> 00:12:33.960
And then I want you to pimp out your community as hardcore as you can. Um,

247
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.880
what do you see as the path to getting out of the

248
00:12:38.881 --> 00:12:42.780
mess that we all feel like we're in the political mess, the cultural mess,

249
00:12:42.781 --> 00:12:46.890
the societal mess. Do you see a path out of it?

250
00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:50.700
<v 0>That really depends on us, doesn't it?</v>

251
00:12:50.701 --> 00:12:54.360
Because we all have to make the choice about how we show up every single day.

252
00:12:54.361 --> 00:12:59.070
And if people don't want to show up in an adult way, then they're not going to,

253
00:12:59.071 --> 00:13:02.220
if people don't want to have conversations with people they disagree with,

254
00:13:02.221 --> 00:13:03.001
they're not going to.

255
00:13:03.001 --> 00:13:06.870
And I think my greatest fear in this whole thing is that it seems as though

256
00:13:06.871 --> 00:13:10.410
there are so many people that are just addicted to anger and outrage and

257
00:13:10.411 --> 00:13:13.500
fighting, and that is a physical addiction. That is an addiction,

258
00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:15.720
just like cigarettes or drugs or alcohol.

259
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:20.040
And so in order to get past that addiction, they have to want to overcome it.

260
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:24.720
And I worry that there aren't enough people that want to overcome it, but again,

261
00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:28.140
I'm on the ground every single week I walk away rallies and I see that there are

262
00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:31.200
so many people that are being kind and like truly kind,

263
00:13:31.201 --> 00:13:32.490
not left is kind of kind,

264
00:13:32.491 --> 00:13:36.060
but truly kind and empathetic and understanding to each other that it really

265
00:13:36.061 --> 00:13:37.830
does give me hope that it's possible,

266
00:13:37.831 --> 00:13:39.690
but we're going to have to see after the election.

267
00:13:39.691 --> 00:13:42.600
I don't think we're going to get there before November, but maybe afterwards.

268
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:44.370
<v 2>Well, I'm with you. Of course. And you know,</v>

269
00:13:44.371 --> 00:13:47.220
I guess I was sort of like the original YLF and the left guy,

270
00:13:47.221 --> 00:13:51.090
but then when I see people like you out there, I'm like, Oh, it's just like,

271
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:55.320
it's real. Like it's real. And it's happening with other people. And it's great.

272
00:13:55.321 --> 00:13:59.220
So Carlin pimp it out, pimp out your locals. Why should people join?

273
00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.200
<v 0>Yeah, they should join because it's just a group of a regular people that we get</v>

274
00:14:04.201 --> 00:14:07.230
together. We chat about topics that are on our mind every single week.

275
00:14:07.231 --> 00:14:09.870
We do it in the community. We do it on zoom. We read books together.

276
00:14:09.871 --> 00:14:13.320
It's super fun. People can join at KB dot locals.

277
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:18.300
<v 2>That's kb.locals.com. And I will see you out there in the field.</v>

278
00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:22.320
