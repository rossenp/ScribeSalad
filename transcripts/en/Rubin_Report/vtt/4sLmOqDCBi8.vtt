1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.500
<v 0>I hope so. I mean,</v>

2
00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:05.400
I had a great interview with Colin Quinn and he just had a book come out and he

3
00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:10.200
was talking about how we live in such crazy times that the extremes

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.610
are telling the independence that they're crazy. And he is, he was saying,

5
00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:17.730
you know, this is the majority of people.

6
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:21.300
How crazy is it that people eat? He's like, they're the craziest,

7
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.530
they're the ideologues.

8
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.230
<v 1>It's locals week here on the Rubin report.</v>

9
00:00:36.231 --> 00:00:40.340
And I'm doing a series of mini interviews with creators on why they decided to

10
00:00:40.341 --> 00:00:44.330
become less reliant on big tech and instead own their content,

11
00:00:44.331 --> 00:00:47.240
community and livelihood with locals.com.

12
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.920
Joining me today is comedian and hosted the dumpster fire. Bridget fettuccine.

13
00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:53.240
Welcome back to the Rubin report.

14
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.450
<v 0>Thank you for having me always a pleasure.</v>

15
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.630
<v 1>Nice to see you again, before we get into your,</v>

16
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.970
your locals community.

17
00:01:01.971 --> 00:01:06.950
And you were literally the first person that I got on locals besides

18
00:01:06.951 --> 00:01:08.690
me. Um, I thought,

19
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.920
I thought we'd talk a little bit about why I thought you'd be the right person.

20
00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:17.270
And it's because you are trying sorta like I'm trying, I think,

21
00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:21.620
to bring a little civility back to discourse, how's that going for you?

22
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.550
<v 0>It's going well in the community. I mean,</v>

23
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.510
it is the last VATE. We did a live chat,

24
00:01:29.511 --> 00:01:34.250
which was really fun because that's like the best feature ever that

25
00:01:34.251 --> 00:01:38.930
brings everybody back to kind of a chat room bag, which is amazing.

26
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.600
And everybody loved it. And we did. And you know, I had some Biden supporters.

27
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.140
I'm completely independent.

28
00:01:45.141 --> 00:01:48.140
Some people who just aren't voting people who are pro-Trump,

29
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.560
all of us were in the chat. Everybody was laughing, nobody,

30
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.820
and nobody was fighting. It was very several people were having disagreements,

31
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.270
but still being cordial to one another. It was amazing.

32
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.300
So I believe that it's still out there.

33
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.470
<v 1>Is it weird that you have to sort of cultivate a space for that? Like,</v>

34
00:02:06.471 --> 00:02:10.520
I think what intrinsically comes to people like me and you pretty obviously

35
00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:14.630
pretty simply naturally that these days it's just like gone.

36
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.980
<v 0>Yeah. I think it's,</v>

37
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.050
I feel like it's less gun in real life than it is online.

38
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.780
So I think if you've got a group of people together,

39
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.210
they probably would,

40
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.630
even if they fell all across the political spectrum,

41
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.030
I would hope they would manage to be civil.

42
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.960
And I imagine they would be more soulful than perhaps they would be online.

43
00:02:38.961 --> 00:02:43.400
Although everybody being quarantined and being online,

44
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.590
I feel like some of that decorum has eroded in that time and

45
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.940
people are forgetting how to behave online and off completely.

46
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.770
And they're becoming more and more kind of polarized or entrenched in their own

47
00:02:57.771 --> 00:02:58.460
beliefs.

48
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.190
So it seems like things because of the

49
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:07.060
pandemic, it kind of accelerated this already, um,

50
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.430
rude and nasty tone that we were already seeing amongst people.

51
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.480
But I do think, you know, unline, it's worse.

52
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:20.500
Obviously people are much there. We are anonymous.

53
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:24.790
It's U P I G I really encourage people in the community to use their name,

54
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:26.350
to use their picture too,

55
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.280
so that we can get to know each other and help each other and have it feel more

56
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:34.540
like a neighborhood and less like a social media where everybody's just,

57
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.200
you know, outwitting each other and trying to be the snarky. Just.

58
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:39.501
<v 1>The things that you,</v>

59
00:03:39.501 --> 00:03:43.530
you push a lot that I always appreciate is that it's not all about politics.

60
00:03:43.531 --> 00:03:45.180
Like even if you love politics,

61
00:03:45.181 --> 00:03:48.840
even if you live politics and I love politics and what I've been doing for a

62
00:03:48.841 --> 00:03:53.130
long time, but that, that life is just not about only that.

63
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.130
<v 0>Yeah, I, I hate politics</v>

64
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.340
and falling into this space has made me hate them even more.

65
00:04:02.341 --> 00:04:06.930
And it's only affirmed everything that I believed before I knew anything about

66
00:04:06.931 --> 00:04:11.550
politics, which is that they're dirty and they bring out, um,

67
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.390
kind of the worst in people. And, and it's,

68
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.610
it's not my favorite topic. And my community is very, you know, I'm,

69
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.710
I'm sober. So I,

70
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.790
I try to talk a lot about just what I've learned in coping tools.

71
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.220
I feel grateful to have learned it in sobriety.

72
00:04:29.221 --> 00:04:32.940
You don't have to be sober to have access to a lot of this stuff.

73
00:04:32.941 --> 00:04:35.010
And my whole, you know,

74
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.070
podcasts walk-ins welcome is about grit and resilience.

75
00:04:38.071 --> 00:04:43.020
And so I do my best to that psychological cultivation of

76
00:04:43.021 --> 00:04:46.080
that attitude is really the most important thing to me.

77
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.910
And I think in the community,

78
00:04:47.911 --> 00:04:50.730
that's the vibe of everybody supporting each other.

79
00:04:50.731 --> 00:04:53.280
I have workouts with the girls five days a week.

80
00:04:53.281 --> 00:04:56.040
So we do zoom workouts and it's been amazing. I mean,

81
00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.150
this community has truly saved me throughout quarantine.

82
00:05:00.151 --> 00:05:04.950
And then the pandemic just keeping me on the beam and working out

83
00:05:04.951 --> 00:05:07.830
and working on ourselves and sharing goals.

84
00:05:07.831 --> 00:05:10.380
And I've seen people help each other through death.

85
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.010
I've seen people help each other help each other through health struggles.

86
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.670
It's just been really inspiring to see, you know,

87
00:05:17.671 --> 00:05:22.350
this virtual community support each other, the way that community should. Yeah.

88
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.780
<v 1>Well, it's funny to me because you're right.</v>

89
00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:29.490
Like we all got sort of jammed online even more because of

90
00:05:29.491 --> 00:05:33.480
COVID we knew there was like a problem with the online discourse and then the,

91
00:05:33.481 --> 00:05:35.940
the solution somehow is that we're all online,

92
00:05:35.941 --> 00:05:39.330
even more and doing everything there. And it's like, we need those spaces.

93
00:05:39.331 --> 00:05:42.120
I'm having dinners with people in the community and,

94
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.410
and we've hired several people for Rubin report and for locals that have come

95
00:05:46.411 --> 00:05:48.330
out of the community and all that. Um,

96
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.780
one of the things that I think you're trying to do also is,

97
00:05:50.781 --> 00:05:55.470
is carve out a space for people to still be, to still be centrist.

98
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.880
Do you, do you think the centrist can survive? The, uh,

99
00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:01.130
the crazy part is in times that we live in.

100
00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.090
<v 0>I hope so. I mean,</v>

101
00:06:04.091 --> 00:06:08.020
I had a great interview with Colin Quinn and he just had a book come out and he

102
00:06:08.021 --> 00:06:12.790
was talking about how we live in such crazy times that the extremes

103
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.200
are telling the independence that they're crazy. And he, he was saying,

104
00:06:17.201 --> 00:06:20.320
you know, this is the majority of people.

105
00:06:20.321 --> 00:06:23.890
How crazy is it that people he's like, they're the crazies,

106
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.180
they're the ideologues,

107
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.860
they're the ones who are extreme and will die on whatever hell and carry,

108
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.230
you know, whatever water they need to carry,

109
00:06:32.231 --> 00:06:35.740
to justify whatever they need to justify to themselves.

110
00:06:35.741 --> 00:06:39.940
And I think people in the middle, you know, more than anything,

111
00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:44.830
I just want people to be okay with expressing confusion or expressing

112
00:06:44.831 --> 00:06:49.300
doubt or expressing uncertainty or expressing the,

113
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.260
I don't know, that's a perfectly acceptable answer.

114
00:06:53.261 --> 00:06:57.070
And these times it is crazy out there. And so.

115
00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:57.850
<v 1>Wait a minute, wait a minute.</v>

116
00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.460
Are you saying you don't know how much yellow cake uranium,

117
00:07:00.461 --> 00:07:02.320
or as in the year end centrifuges.

118
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:05.620
<v 0>Did they even put yellow.</v>

119
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.470
<v 1>Cake uranium in centrifuges? That just sounds like something.</v>

120
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.880
<v 0>I know, less than nothing.</v>

121
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:17.460
The more I've entered into this realm. I, the more I've realized,

122
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.110
I know it's so very little about anything,

123
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:25.510
and it's easy to just get online and become an expert in whatever

124
00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:27.580
is trending because that's,

125
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:32.170
you can Wikipedia things and become this kind of armchair expert and any single

126
00:07:32.171 --> 00:07:34.990
thing that pops up. But really,

127
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.770
we don't know that much unless we are experts.

128
00:07:38.771 --> 00:07:42.370
And I I'm okay with being kind of the,

129
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:47.200
the dummy who is asking a lot of questions.

130
00:07:47.201 --> 00:07:49.930
And that's the other thing I'm noticing is that people are afraid to even ask

131
00:07:49.931 --> 00:07:54.610
questions. It's not even vote for XYZ. If you don't say,

132
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.720
if you say I'm not voting or voting third party,

133
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.680
you will basically be called a fascist as well.

134
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.310
Fascinate it's fat. It's fascinating to me to just see how,

135
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:10.990
um,

136
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:15.940
that there's a loss of people being able

137
00:08:15.941 --> 00:08:20.260
to speak their three and honest opinion and truth,

138
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:25.270
and so more important than anything is that we all

139
00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:28.900
continue to cultivate spaces where that's okay.

140
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.080
Where people feel like they can just say, I mean,

141
00:08:32.081 --> 00:08:35.050
I can't tell you how many emails I get from people who are politically home

142
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.750
homeless, who are like, I don't even care if you read this.

143
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.040
That just felt so good to say because they, they don't have anywhere.

144
00:08:42.041 --> 00:08:43.120
They can express us.

145
00:08:43.121 --> 00:08:47.650
So I'm hoping that my community can be that place where people can, um,

146
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.000
express their confusion. I think Jack Kerouac had a great quote.

147
00:08:52.001 --> 00:08:54.310
I have nothing to offer the world, but my confusion,

148
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.320
I feel like that's very much my vibe.

149
00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:58.370
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. Well,</v>

150
00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:01.130
when I've jumped into your community and I just kind of see what's going on,

151
00:09:01.131 --> 00:09:06.110
it's like people are sharing other things besides politics and they're trying

152
00:09:06.111 --> 00:09:07.190
to help each other out.

153
00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:12.410
And it's like that really remember the word social is in social media.

154
00:09:12.411 --> 00:09:13.670
It's like it was supposed to make right.

155
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.760
Foodies and what'd you have for dinner and all that. That's my, I mean,

156
00:09:16.761 --> 00:09:20.930
half and half of my community is just doing recipes and dinners, but it's like,

157
00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.890
you're smiling as you're saying it, because it's like, Oh,

158
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.290
there's something good happening there. But it's, it's like,

159
00:09:27.291 --> 00:09:29.990
people are on Twitter just telling you how miserable they are all day long.

160
00:09:29.991 --> 00:09:33.350
And yet we're there too. So irony, whatever. Yeah.

161
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:34.851
<v 0>Yeah. I mean,</v>

162
00:09:34.851 --> 00:09:39.350
I like Twitter because I really feel like it's the

163
00:09:39.351 --> 00:09:43.370
Thunderdome. So you get to just, it it's,

164
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.770
it's very hard to be free there too.

165
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:50.300
And I like to challenge myself on Twitter because

166
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:55.670
it's an exercise in what I'm not saying. So when it first started,

167
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.400
when I first went on Twitter and started getting notice,

168
00:09:58.401 --> 00:10:02.930
even by people on the right, uh, you'll lean into what's working.

169
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:07.730
And I generally have this rule where wherever I have a tweet that goes really

170
00:10:07.731 --> 00:10:09.890
big, I'll do the opposite.

171
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.270
Or I'll say something just so that I can weed out anybody who might think that

172
00:10:14.271 --> 00:10:19.100
I'm too much of a, um, w you know, you can see one tweet and be like,

173
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.570
Oh, I know who this person is,

174
00:10:20.571 --> 00:10:24.950
but I need to weed out the people who can't handle differing

175
00:10:24.951 --> 00:10:29.360
opinions, because on both sides, there are people who can I handle it?

176
00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:33.350
You're saying anything bad about Trump or anything bad about the left.

177
00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:38.000
<v 1>Yeah. Where do you see the internet going in the next couple of years?</v>

178
00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:42.620
You think that you think these, these big things that they'll bell exist still,

179
00:10:42.621 --> 00:10:45.710
it seems like everything's kind of crumbling. Maybe they'll look very different.

180
00:10:45.711 --> 00:10:47.810
I've been asking everybody this question.

181
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.250
<v 0>Yeah. That's a good question. Um,</v>

182
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:57.960
I don't know where anything will be in two years or three in,

183
00:10:57.961 --> 00:11:00.650
in the future. I feel like it,

184
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.870
all of the things that we never could have considered possible are

185
00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.990
playing out are happening. So I have to really,

186
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:14.510
really get my mind around being comfortable with being

187
00:11:14.511 --> 00:11:19.130
uncertain and not really having any idea what I think Twitter will

188
00:11:19.131 --> 00:11:22.130
survive. My, my feeling, even seeing them,

189
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.350
my 12 year old nephew now loves Twitter,

190
00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:28.970
because it is the fastest social media in terms of the conversation.

191
00:11:28.971 --> 00:11:33.200
And it is this think tank for all of these kinds of thought

192
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:38.050
people. Um, and the conversation is kind of happening there.

193
00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:42.320
I wouldn't be surprised as if it survives, but it,

194
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:43.760
it seems,

195
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:49.130
it seems like the forces

196
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:51.470
to silence people.

197
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:56.530
And I'm seeing this even like I was in clubhouse last night. Holy crap.

198
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.820
I mean, wow.

199
00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:01.650
<v 1>Wow. I don't even know really. I got an invite a long time ago.</v>

200
00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:04.470
Like I logged on once and I was like, I don't need to like,

201
00:12:04.471 --> 00:12:07.530
listen to these people talking. I dunno, like we need more of it.

202
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.600
It's amazing. You know, what I really love about it.

203
00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:17.310
<v 0>Is that it's basically like being at a conference and you can just go pop in and</v>

204
00:12:17.311 --> 00:12:20.160
listen to a panel of speakers. That's how I see it.

205
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:25.320
But then with the introduction of people that make people in there not

206
00:12:25.321 --> 00:12:28.560
feel safe, it's caused a lot of discussion,

207
00:12:28.561 --> 00:12:32.760
the same discussions that happen on every single platform about who's allowed to

208
00:12:32.761 --> 00:12:36.720
be speaking, who is allowed to be where. And so this is the,

209
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:41.490
this is the conversation that I think will alter all of these

210
00:12:41.491 --> 00:12:44.220
platforms. The most, you know, Twitter, Facebook,

211
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.710
who is allowed to speak where,

212
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.990
and why I love locals is because I feel like on mouse and

213
00:12:51.991 --> 00:12:56.190
I have talked about this. At least we get a phone call before we get booted.

214
00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.920
<v 1>I mean, you can do whatever you want. It's up to you.</v>

215
00:12:58.921 --> 00:13:01.440
As long as you're not breaking the laws of the United States, you know,

216
00:13:01.441 --> 00:13:06.150
you've shown a little, a little more skin than say I've shown on mine. But, uh,

217
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.360
as long as I don't care what you do in there, I mean the whole, the whole,

218
00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:12.390
you know, development team, they don't care. It's your community. It's like,

219
00:13:12.391 --> 00:13:15.240
we're just giving you some tools. You go, you go do what you want.

220
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.610
<v 0>Yeah, it's great. It feels very free. And I liked that. And I, I, you know,</v>

221
00:13:20.611 --> 00:13:25.510
it's really empowering in that. I have it,

222
00:13:25.511 --> 00:13:29.400
it goes through, um, like my Stripe account.

223
00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:34.020
I feel like that's the most empowering thing because I've been a lot of these

224
00:13:34.021 --> 00:13:38.820
other sites and it's goes to them. We get paid out. We have to wait.

225
00:13:38.821 --> 00:13:42.870
It's, this is truly giving the creators,

226
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:48.120
the tools to their audience and access to their audience and not being a

227
00:13:48.121 --> 00:13:52.920
gatekeeper because, and in this time, when there are gatekeepers everywhere,

228
00:13:52.921 --> 00:13:56.460
and you can just get booted off a platform and sorry,

229
00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.490
you now have to fight for your stuff and fight for your audience.

230
00:13:59.491 --> 00:14:04.260
And now scramble to tell everybody this feels a lot more

231
00:14:04.261 --> 00:14:08.220
empowering. And I think that that is the future. And it's the,

232
00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:12.390
it's the most exciting, one of the most exciting things,

233
00:14:12.391 --> 00:14:16.900
other than just the sexiness of the actual design and

234
00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:20.850
platform about locals for me as a creator.

235
00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:23.520
<v 1>Yeah. Just to be clear for people that don't get what you're saying,</v>

236
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:26.430
it's your Stripe account. Meaning if you're a crater on there, right.

237
00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:28.380
It's your personal Stripe account.

238
00:14:28.381 --> 00:14:31.290
So we locals doesn't collect the money on your behalf and then pay you,

239
00:14:31.291 --> 00:14:34.980
your paid as people sign up, then locals gets their cut,

240
00:14:34.981 --> 00:14:38.490
but it all goes through you. So there's no, there's no middleman.

241
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:43.620
<v 0>Yeah, exactly. And in my case, they're subscribing to fettucine Inc. I mean,</v>

242
00:14:43.621 --> 00:14:45.420
this is, this is an amazing,

243
00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:48.950
and people just kind of assume that that's the way it was,

244
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.610
was because, um, that's the way it is.

245
00:14:52.611 --> 00:14:57.020
And the fact that locals has made that very small,

246
00:14:57.021 --> 00:15:01.610
but obvious shift in the way that this works is I think,

247
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.530
um, enormously important for creators in this space,

248
00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:11.090
moving forward when things are shifting and, and, um,

249
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:14.960
people are being de platformed and silenced and, and booted.

250
00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:18.100
<v 1>Fantasy. You're making me look good for picking you first.</v>

251
00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:22.180
<v 0>I'm a business woman.</v>

252
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:27.160
<v 1>All right. Well, everyone can go to fed izzy.locals.com or just fed izzy.com,</v>

253
00:15:27.161 --> 00:15:31.510
just redirects to locals. And I hope to see you in real life, one of these days.

254
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.320
Yeah.

255
00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:37.120
<v 0>I know. No, I know it's,</v>

256
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.070
it's overdue. I will set it up,

257
00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.830
but thank you for creating this and thank you to the team.

258
00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:45.160
You have an amazing team behind you and working with you,

259
00:15:45.161 --> 00:15:49.780
and they're all very loving and supportive and, and brilliant and talented.

260
00:15:49.781 --> 00:15:53.320
So I appreciate all their help.

261
00:15:53.321 --> 00:15:57.610
And I want them to know that I see how hard they work and what they're doing,

262
00:15:57.611 --> 00:16:02.470
and it's, it's not, it doesn't go unnoticed with me or my community.

263
00:16:02.471 --> 00:16:05.050
I hear about it all the time from them. So thank you.

264
00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:08.290
<v 1>Well, I love to hear that and they'll be happy to hear that. All right, Bridget,</v>

265
00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.153
we'll talk soon.

266
00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.020
