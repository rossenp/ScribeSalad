1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.020
<v 0>The project that the New York times was given the pullets, uh, uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.670
for this year of recasting the history of the United States in terms of

3
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.010
slavery as the primary narrative,

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.750
the 1619 project seems to me just to be fundamentally historically

5
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.700
wrong. It's a distortion.

6
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.420
This isn't to say that slavery didn't matter.

7
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.550
It just doesn't mean it's not important.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.050
It's just that if you were to try to explain the significance of the

9
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:30.750
United States to a visiting Marsh,

10
00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:33.600
and you wouldn't start with slavery,

11
00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:37.950
because that wasn't really an especially unique feature of the

12
00:00:37.951 --> 00:00:42.150
United States, there was slavery and it lasted much longer in Brazil. Uh,

13
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.690
there were slavery and it was far harsher in the Caribbean, uh,

14
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.450
colonies of Britain than other European States.

15
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.610
So what's the defining characteristic.

16
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.730
What's the thing that makes the United States distinctive.

17
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.740
It's not slavery.

18
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.720
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

19
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.340
<v 2>Historian's perspective.</v>

20
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.500
What do you think that the average American should know about the

21
00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:17.120
history of America that we don't know or that we underappreciate, because,

22
00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:18.770
you know, we seem to live in a time where we're,

23
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.610
we're erasing our own history and we're taking down monuments and we're,

24
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.940
you know, destroying the names of people that were flawed,

25
00:01:25.941 --> 00:01:27.530
but that were just people of their time.

26
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.990
<v 0>Well, I think the, the challenge here is, uh,</v>

27
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.000
that history is not, uh, it's not monochrome, uh,

28
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.040
the history of any great society or state can't be

29
00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:45.440
told, uh, as a eulogy,

30
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.300
not nor as a kind of criminal indictment and the good

31
00:01:50.301 --> 00:01:51.620
historian, uh,

32
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.550
of the United States or for that matter of the United Kingdom,

33
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.550
acknowledges that there are, uh,

34
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.450
debits as well as credits that there is there's shadow,

35
00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:06.920
there's dark sides to the story as well as bright sides. And this is, uh,

36
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.090
a challenge that I,

37
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.830
I didn't think was difficult when I was writing early in my

38
00:02:12.831 --> 00:02:15.140
career. I wrote a history of the British empire,

39
00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:18.950
which included a chapter on the American revolution. And, uh,

40
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.210
the book sets out very plainly, uh, the,

41
00:02:22.211 --> 00:02:26.510
the many stains on the history of the British empire, including, uh,

42
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.110
of course the, uh, the central role of slavery in the,

43
00:02:30.111 --> 00:02:34.430
in the Southern colonies that became the Southern States of the

44
00:02:34.431 --> 00:02:36.140
United States. Uh,

45
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.950
but the point of that book and I'd make the same argument about the history of

46
00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:41.630
the United States is that the,

47
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.430
the benefits weighed the costs that the successes

48
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.760
were more important ultimately than the failures.

49
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.470
The project that the New York times was given the pullets, uh, uh,

50
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.120
for this year of recasting the history of the United States in terms of

51
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.010
slavery as the primary narrative, the 60 19 project,

52
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.760
it seems to me just to be fundamentally historically wrong.

53
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:08.140
It's a distortion,

54
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.860
this isn't to say that slavery didn't matter.

55
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:13.990
It just doesn't mean it's not important.

56
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.490
It's just that if you were to try to explain the significance of the

57
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:22.000
United States to a visiting Martian, yeah.

58
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:26.950
You wouldn't start with slavery because that wasn't really an especially unique

59
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.260
feature of the United States.

60
00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:32.590
There was slavery and it lasted much longer in Brazil. Uh,

61
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.480
there were slavery and it was far harsher in the Caribbean colonies of Britain

62
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.050
and other European States. So what's the defining characteristic.

63
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.170
What's the thing that makes the United States distinctive.

64
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.900
It's not slavery, uh,

65
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.870
any more than if you looked at Western civilization broadly, uh, uh,

66
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.660
it would be true to say that imperialism's the defining characteristic.

67
00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.550
Everybody did empire just as slavery goes way back before 60 19,

68
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.510
all the way to ancient times. And by the way, still exists,

69
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.710
there is still slavery. There are slave markets, uh,

70
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.440
where people are sold. There are slave economies,

71
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.600
which rely on slave labor today.

72
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.810
So it can't really be true to say that the interesting thing,

73
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:19.810
the thing you really need to know about the United States is slavery.

74
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.310
But the interesting thing about the United States is that it represented an

75
00:04:24.311 --> 00:04:27.040
experiment in governance, uh,

76
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.600
a radical experiment based on ideas from the enlightenment and earlier

77
00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:35.470
ideas from the Protestant reformation. It's fair to say. And,

78
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.920
and this produced an extraordinary constitution,

79
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.690
which has stood up to, uh, all the stresses and strains, uh,

80
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.480
of, uh, of history since, uh,

81
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.770
the late 18th century and understanding that peculiar

82
00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:54.670
constitution, that very distinctive document with its separation of powers,

83
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.370
and it's careful preservations of individuals,

84
00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.320
but that should be your top priority. If you're studying American history,

85
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.330
not to the exclusion of the bad stuff, there's plenty of bad stuff, uh,

86
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.680
that we need to study,

87
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.300
but I don't think we should be teaching young Americans from Howard Zinn's

88
00:05:13.301 --> 00:05:17.680
people's history of the United States in which the negatives are constantly

89
00:05:17.681 --> 00:05:19.120
emphasized over the positives.

90
00:05:19.121 --> 00:05:22.450
That just seems to me to miss the point of the American story completely.

91
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.570
<v 2>Are you worried that the extraordinary pressures that we're facing right now</v>

92
00:05:27.571 --> 00:05:32.190
between a pandemic between riots and protests between,

93
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.520
you know, polarization that really is,

94
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.160
is off the charts and then throw in social media,

95
00:05:38.161 --> 00:05:39.540
which is just gas on the flame.

96
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.610
Are you worried that those pressures could snap that project in a way that it

97
00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:48.420
hasn't been snapped before, or certainly in the last hundred years?

98
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.560
<v 0>Dave, let me give you a somewhat surprising answer to that question.</v>

99
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.360
I'd be worried if we weren't worried.

100
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.970
One of the things about this country that's very,

101
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.650
is that we're always worried that the Republic's going to end.

102
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.900
We're always kind of fretting about, uh, about the coming tyranny, uh,

103
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.420
the impending civil war, and, uh,

104
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:13.060
and thus far there's been one civil war and no dictatorships. Uh,

105
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.870
and that's kind of encouraging.

106
00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:19.130
I think that's partly because we worry about this and I think it's a healthy

107
00:06:19.131 --> 00:06:22.700
feature of American life also to expect decline. Uh,

108
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.760
people have been predicting the decline of the United States, uh,

109
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.650
throughout my life. Uh,

110
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.390
it was a preoccupation of Henry Kissinger whose biography I'm in the midst of,

111
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.400
of writing in the 1970s. It seems as if the United States was being torn apart,

112
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.270
uh, by Vietnam torn apart by its, uh,

113
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.070
racial divisions torn apart by a president who had violated his, uh,

114
00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:49.190
his oath of office, all of that we've seen before.

115
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.090
And I think it's part of the way the United States works,

116
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:57.440
that we're always expecting the disintegration of the Republic and the descent

117
00:06:57.441 --> 00:06:58.490
into civil war. And I,

118
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.020
I think we'll have to start being nervous if we stop worrying about that stuff.

119
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.650
But as long as we have my old friend, Andrew Sullivan,

120
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.130
so fretful about the coming Trump tyranny,

121
00:07:10.131 --> 00:07:14.870
that he doesn't quite spot the tyranny of the left until it's right up behind

122
00:07:14.871 --> 00:07:19.190
him. I mean, that, that's kind of the predicament that I think a lot of, uh,

123
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:24.170
liberals and conservatives find themselves in that they were so indignant and

124
00:07:24.171 --> 00:07:26.840
dismayed by Trump back in 2016,

125
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:31.280
that they slightly underestimated that the rather more

126
00:07:31.281 --> 00:07:33.380
operationally worrying, uh,

127
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.060
tyrannical tendencies of the radical left. Uh, so yeah,

128
00:07:38.061 --> 00:07:40.370
I think we should keep worrying about this stuff.

129
00:07:40.371 --> 00:07:43.250
And as long as we're worrying about it, we'll probably be okay.

130
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.270
<v 2>Yeah. Does it also strike you as,</v>

131
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.820
as odd or maybe obvious relative to social media that when something

132
00:07:51.821 --> 00:07:55.690
happens here that it suddenly happens everywhere? I mean,

133
00:07:55.691 --> 00:07:58.000
we've all seen the videos now of,

134
00:07:58.001 --> 00:08:02.950
of literally police officers in London being hunted down by mobs that

135
00:08:02.951 --> 00:08:07.210
has nothing to do in any concrete sense with what happened to

136
00:08:07.211 --> 00:08:10.750
George Floyd. And yet it seems like if there's an incident here,

137
00:08:10.751 --> 00:08:12.250
it's now exported everywhere.

138
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:18.400
<v 0>I think future historians will wonder why it was that in the midst of</v>

139
00:08:18.401 --> 00:08:22.450
a pandemic, which is far from over Americans,

140
00:08:22.451 --> 00:08:24.880
decided to have a debate about, uh,

141
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.970
police violence towards,

142
00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:29.980
African-Americans not,

143
00:08:29.981 --> 00:08:33.760
not to say that that's not an important issue to think about,

144
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:38.860
but it seems an odd time to have that debate and to start debates about

145
00:08:38.861 --> 00:08:40.090
defunding the police.

146
00:08:40.091 --> 00:08:43.600
When we should really be wondering what went wrong with the department of health

147
00:08:43.601 --> 00:08:45.850
and human services and CDC,

148
00:08:45.851 --> 00:08:50.410
when they ought to have taken far better and earlier action to

149
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.680
contain the contagion. There's something strange. It's a,

150
00:08:53.681 --> 00:08:58.560
non-sequitur that in the midst of this massive public health crisis, uh,

151
00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:03.150
which has killed nearly 120,000 Americans and will probably kill another 120,000

152
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:06.060
before the end of the year, we're having this, this debate.

153
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:10.850
But the second point I'd make is that the internet has created a

154
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:15.690
new kind of contagion. As I said earlier, quoting my son,

155
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:20.310
there are two pandemics and, and the second pandemic, uh, in fact,

156
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.700
predates the merger of, uh, of George Floyd,

157
00:09:23.701 --> 00:09:28.500
because it's a pandemic of protest that you could actually see

158
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.370
in Hong Kong, uh, in Santiago, uh,

159
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:36.600
in Barcelona, in cities like Beirut last year. Uh,

160
00:09:36.601 --> 00:09:41.250
and what is interesting to me is that the mode of protest is consistently the

161
00:09:41.251 --> 00:09:43.860
same, the content varies from place to place,

162
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.990
but this quality of a protest to go viral styles of

163
00:09:48.991 --> 00:09:52.740
protest to be co copied from Hong Kong, uh,

164
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.440
to Minneapolis is really interesting. I mean,

165
00:09:55.441 --> 00:10:00.240
historically the police are better communications than demonstrators for most of

166
00:10:00.241 --> 00:10:03.360
the second half of the 20th century, uh,

167
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.510
that the police had walkie talkies and the demonstrators were lucky if they had
