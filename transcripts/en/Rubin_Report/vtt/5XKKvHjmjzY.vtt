1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.320
<v 0>Our major partners, Sierra Nevada, Squaw Valley, Yosemite.</v>

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.640
None of them were accepting new product. It got pushed back to the next season,

3
00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:09.361
fall winter.

4
00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:13.860
So that's basically six months of income that we don't have.

5
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.660
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

6
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.660
<v 2>Dave Rubin and it's small business week here on the Rubin report.</v>

7
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.430
Joining me today is Bryce Cooley co-owner of robe supply company

8
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.550
from Truckee, California, Bryce, welcome to the show.

9
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.640
<v 0>Hey Dave, thanks a lot for having me really appreciate it.</v>

10
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.220
<v 2>I'm glad to be with you. Now.</v>

11
00:00:40.221 --> 00:00:44.930
I can tell you that I know that you guys make fine caps because you have sent us

12
00:00:44.931 --> 00:00:48.080
a couple custom hats and, and we appreciate it.

13
00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:52.250
My weekend at is the Sierra Nevada that you've sent us. Uh,

14
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.190
tell me a little bit about robe supply,

15
00:00:55.191 --> 00:00:57.290
what you guys are doing and how you got into the biz.

16
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.280
<v 0>Uh, I mean, pretty funny, our friend, Zach and Laura,</v>

17
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.690
who we started the company with,

18
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.070
they did repping for a bunch of outdoor clothing companies, cool. Keen,

19
00:01:07.071 --> 00:01:08.480
footwear, all that kind of stuff.

20
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.090
And so they had all these existing connections.

21
00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:13.310
I was the youth pastor for several years,

22
00:01:13.311 --> 00:01:17.330
and now I do kind of video audio stuff up at a different church.

23
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.920
And we just kind of talked he's very entrepreneurial and was like,

24
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.020
and just got us to buy into this vision of wanting to work for ourselves,

25
00:01:27.021 --> 00:01:30.200
wanting to be able to provide for our families, all this kind of stuff,

26
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.430
just to provide for our kids, the most valuable people in our lives.

27
00:01:34.431 --> 00:01:39.170
And so I hadn't even worn a hat before he talked to me about making hats.

28
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.020
And then he just kind of talked to me about the,

29
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.710
the margins are this and they're really good and you can make them for this and

30
00:01:45.711 --> 00:01:48.560
sell them for this. And I didn't know, business. I was like,

31
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.790
those words sound good to me. And so he,

32
00:01:52.791 --> 00:01:57.710
he got us to buy into it and it was right after we had our first child that we

33
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.030
actually started and got some connections based on their existing

34
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.860
connections they had with people and then moved slowly grown over the past

35
00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:10.910
several years. And it's been a trial, but it's been good.

36
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.020
It's been real good.

37
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.700
<v 2>Yeah. So as you know,</v>

38
00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:16.700
the reason that I wanted to do small business week is because people like you

39
00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:21.380
guys are dealing with all sorts of crazy stuff that really nobody

40
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.250
expected from supply chain to sales, to everything else.

41
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.360
What are some of the struggles and maybe even some of the successes that you've

42
00:02:29.361 --> 00:02:31.580
seen in the midst of the COVID situation?

43
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.643
<v 0>Yeah, well,</v>

44
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.630
I think Elon Musk said being an entrepreneur is like eating glass and staring

45
00:02:38.631 --> 00:02:42.170
into the abyss of death. And I, I don't,

46
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.610
I don't think he had COVID in mind, but it definitely felt like that at times.

47
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.490
So our hats are actually produced in China.

48
00:02:49.491 --> 00:02:52.970
So that adds a separate layer, uh, kind of on it.

49
00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:57.860
So the first weeks of January, that's kind of when they shut down for awhile.

50
00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.830
And so we were three weeks then,

51
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:02.470
and then there's a 14 day quarantine in their factories.

52
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:06.760
And so that was even longer. And so we're pushed back several weeks. Uh,

53
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:10.210
so right when we got all of our samples for spring, summer 20,

54
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.100
right now everything's shut down. And so our major partners,

55
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.920
uh, Sierra Nevada, Squaw Valley Yosemite,

56
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.240
none of them were accepting new product. It got pushed back to the next season,

57
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:22.960
fall winter.

58
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.640
So that's basically six months of income that we don't have.

59
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.310
Uh, and you know,

60
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:34.750
luckily we're in a business where we're not going month to month, we get paid,

61
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:37.000
you know, when purchase orders come in and all that.

62
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:41.980
And so we just really cut back a lot of stuff in and were able

63
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:45.130
to get PPP and Eid L after a lot of headache,

64
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.170
we're able to get some of that stuff to kind of help carry us. But it,

65
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.300
we were thinking we're going to have to stop getting paid in the next month

66
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:57.610
or two and all of that kind of stuff. And,

67
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.980
and we had to bring on new clients as well to try to make up for the fact that

68
00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:04.810
we're now missing six months of income.

69
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.050
<v 2>Can you talk a little bit about the PP headache? Because it was like, you know,</v>

70
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.670
I'm a small business owner too, and,

71
00:04:11.671 --> 00:04:15.330
and we applied for it and then we got it and then they changed the rules.

72
00:04:15.331 --> 00:04:18.600
And then there was another rule change and I had to have a big sit-down with my

73
00:04:18.601 --> 00:04:21.560
business managers and, and the whole thing. Um, what,

74
00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:24.570
what was that like for you guys and how desperate it sounds like,

75
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.510
sounds like you might've been okay without it, but you you're, you know,

76
00:04:27.511 --> 00:04:28.344
it helps, right?

77
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.030
<v 0>Yeah. So we, we would have been okay for a short time, without it,</v>

78
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.690
basically we could have made it kind of through the lockdown,

79
00:04:36.691 --> 00:04:41.280
but then right after that, all of our production money, all of our payroll,

80
00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:44.760
all of that would have had to stop and we'd have to just kind of work for free

81
00:04:44.761 --> 00:04:47.370
until, uh, production orders started coming in.

82
00:04:47.371 --> 00:04:52.050
So ultimately we reached out to our bank and we said like, okay,

83
00:04:52.051 --> 00:04:53.820
can we put this in now? They're like, well, you know,

84
00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:57.810
there's so many things coming in, let's wait until this of the other thing.

85
00:04:57.811 --> 00:04:59.580
And we're like, we really need to do it now.

86
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.390
And so we ended up missing the first loan. They ran out of money by the time,

87
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.060
uh, they actually got it through or whatever.

88
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.860
And so then we had to refill everything out again. Uh,

89
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.130
and finally we got in on the tail end of the second one.

90
00:05:14.131 --> 00:05:16.440
So that was a huge blessing. You know,

91
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.020
I don't love like getting handouts or whatever,

92
00:05:19.021 --> 00:05:23.100
but it was a blessing door to keep our small staff getting paid through this and

93
00:05:23.101 --> 00:05:26.190
allowing them to provide for their families. That was huge for us.

94
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.510
<v 2>So since you mentioned being a youth pastor, uh, before all this,</v>

95
00:05:30.511 --> 00:05:31.800
can you talk about just as a,

96
00:05:31.801 --> 00:05:35.640
as a small business owner sort of owning and controlling your destiny and,

97
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.710
and having to navigate, Oh,

98
00:05:37.711 --> 00:05:41.730
these things that happen out of nowhere that you didn't expect sort of how that

99
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.310
sort of, you know, how that sort of encompasses your, your philosophy around?

100
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.350
<v 0>Oh man. Well,</v>

101
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.600
I would say the Christian faith definitely kind of points out that unexpected

102
00:05:54.601 --> 00:05:56.040
things happen and, you know,

103
00:05:56.041 --> 00:06:00.710
there's this idea of a peace that transcends all understanding. So, you know,

104
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.650
ultimately we have trusted God through this.

105
00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:08.540
Like this is a crazy situation for everyone to be in and it just hit everyone.

106
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:12.650
And even when I was kinda in my moment, freaking out, or my wife was,

107
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.980
or Zach was, we were kind of able to balance like, no, I think we're,

108
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.600
we're going to be okay. And, you know,

109
00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:22.130
just kinda work through that and just praying would kind of calm me

110
00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:27.110
down and just relax me also working my butt off to try to get new clients

111
00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:30.680
and then getting positive feedback that also helped. Uh, we're actually,

112
00:06:30.681 --> 00:06:34.430
this is kind of fun. We're currently in development with Tesla,

113
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.360
maybe making some stuff for them, which would be a huge, wow.

114
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.500
Like that'd be a huge blessing, but you know, I wanna get my hopes up,

115
00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:46.050
but pretty excited about that. But, uh, uh, so our,

116
00:06:46.051 --> 00:06:48.260
our faith really kind of gave us peace in that.

117
00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:52.910
And as far as the way that we do our business, we really try to do it ethically.

118
00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:55.280
The factory is fair trade.

119
00:06:55.281 --> 00:07:00.020
We try to wherever we can be eco-conscious and use recyclable materials and

120
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.170
all that kind of stuff where it's possible. We try to,

121
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.000
we try to give the best quality that we can to the people we

122
00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:09.020
customize hats for.

123
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.640
<v 2>Yeah. And you guys really do make a great hat. Like I've got,</v>

124
00:07:12.641 --> 00:07:17.140
I got about 30 hats in my closet. You guys really do make a great hat. Uh,

125
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.780
so I gotta ask you this from once from,

126
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.720
from one small business guy in California,

127
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.420
to another small business guy in California,

128
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.630
you have any struggles doing business in California.

129
00:07:28.631 --> 00:07:30.070
We're paying a lot in taxes.

130
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.890
There's all sorts of red tape and regulations and the rest of it.

131
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.950
I always find people when, when I talk about this, people always say, well,

132
00:07:35.951 --> 00:07:38.680
Dave, you're doing business in California. What do you expect?

133
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.210
What do you make of that?

134
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:45.370
<v 0>Yeah. Uh, and this is the one time I'll give my dad, uh,</v>

135
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.970
ribbing. My dad works in the assembly and I'm like, dad,

136
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.790
you're killing me with this business stuff. You know, sorry.

137
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:56.260
I th I throw it to him and he he's aware of it. Yeah. I mean,

138
00:07:56.261 --> 00:08:01.030
taxes are high and it makes it difficult to bring on employees and all of that

139
00:08:01.031 --> 00:08:05.200
kind of stuff. I mean, the, the thing that I've just kind of processed through.

140
00:08:05.201 --> 00:08:09.070
It's like we live in a high tech state, but everyone that I love is here.

141
00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:11.470
So I need to decide, what do I want to sacrifice?

142
00:08:11.471 --> 00:08:15.640
Do I want to sacrifice the relationships to bring in some more money or do I

143
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:19.420
want to sacrifice money to stay around relationships?

144
00:08:19.421 --> 00:08:23.110
Let my girls be near their grandparents and their cousins and their aunts and

145
00:08:23.111 --> 00:08:25.720
uncles and all that kind of stuff. So, yeah,

146
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:30.520
it is very difficult owning a business in California, but you know,

147
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:34.420
th this is where we're at right now. We might be moving up to Eldorado County.

148
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:39.220
God-willing uh, so w my self and my wife live in Sacramento,

149
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.260
Beth, Zach and Laura live in Truckee.

150
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:44.330
And so we kind of telework even before all of this.

151
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.280
<v 2>Yeah. Uh, before we wrap up, uh,</v>

152
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.300
I want to give you a full-on chance to promote the hell out of your hats right

153
00:08:52.301 --> 00:08:56.010
now. Let's see, go into full salesmen mode right now, man, here you go.

154
00:08:56.011 --> 00:08:56.844
Take it away.

155
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.630
<v 0>All right, Zach. Sorry if I don't do well, but, uh, we,</v>

156
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:05.340
we have been working with some awesome people for a long time. Sierra,

157
00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:09.000
Nevada brewing squad Valley, all of that stuff. Uh,

158
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.980
we are for the first time,

159
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.190
I believe the store is going live at the beginning of July.

160
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.970
We're going to make our own row branded hats for the first time ever.

161
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.550
We've always been doing private label, custom headwear.

162
00:09:20.551 --> 00:09:24.240
Now we're going to actually do some of our own with our own hat on it.

163
00:09:24.241 --> 00:09:29.160
So if you want to support two families who are just trying to love people

164
00:09:29.161 --> 00:09:32.190
and serve the community and do all of that kind of stuff,

165
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:36.240
like it would be a huge blessing to us. If you actually have a company,

166
00:09:36.241 --> 00:09:39.210
we have minimums of 576 per style,

167
00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:43.080
but if you want some really good quality hats that lasts, come to us,

168
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:47.910
shoot me an email or Instagram is at Rove supply. You can shoot me an email

169
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.650
bryce@rofesupply.com and I'd be glad to hook you up.

170
00:09:52.651 --> 00:09:54.570
And we can kind of start that conversation.

171
00:09:54.571 --> 00:09:59.280
So really appreciate the time to do this, Dave, and just, it means a lot.

172
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:00.323
Thank you.

173
00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.890
<v 2>The, I think your partner is going to be proud of the sales pitch. And for real,</v>

174
00:10:03.891 --> 00:10:06.740
I'm telling you, I got a ton of hats, but you guys, you guys make a real hat.

175
00:10:06.741 --> 00:10:09.170
Like it, doesn't kind of collapse on you or, you know,

176
00:10:09.171 --> 00:10:12.080
you put some hats on and then you can feel that they're just not that well.

177
00:10:12.081 --> 00:10:15.170
Like you can see it on your head. It's Primo quality stuff.

178
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.340
I appreciate your support.

179
00:10:16.341 --> 00:10:19.700
You're a member of the Rubin report community as well. And, uh,

180
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.640
one of these days when, when people actually see each other again,

181
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.350
I'll get up to Northern Cali and okay.

182
00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.910
<v 0>Yeah. I was supposed to see in San Francisco, but that all, you know,</v>

183
00:10:28.911 --> 00:10:32.960
then everything got all shut down. So yeah. Hey, when you need hats,

184
00:10:32.961 --> 00:10:33.794
