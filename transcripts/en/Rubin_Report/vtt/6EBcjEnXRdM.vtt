00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.080
<v 0>Free markets,</v>

2
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.270
big tech and free speech often do not get along very

3
00:00:06.271 --> 00:00:11.130
well because they have an interest to their, obviously to their investors.

4
00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:13.890
And then you have things happening on Patrion,

5
00:00:13.891 --> 00:00:16.710
like the actual financial backings,

6
00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:20.190
like MasterCard kind of putting the pressure on to boot people.

7
00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:23.550
And now there are so many different topics,

8
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:26.640
but I don't believe everyone has a right to a platform.

9
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.460
<v 1>Let's shift a little bit here because let's talk about big tech because you've</v>

10
00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:37.760
got an interesting announcement coming. Uh,

11
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.550
but just relative to the whole big tech conversation.

12
00:00:40.551 --> 00:00:42.890
And as someone that you now, you might be shadow banned.

13
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.880
And we don't know if they're going to get us and shadow banning as I keep

14
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.100
endlessly repeating is now quite literally in the Twitter terms of service.

15
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.790
If you are an American, it doesn't apply to the Europeans for some reason.

16
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.000
But if you're an American that is now in the terms of service on Twitter,

17
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.870
that they can throttle who sees your tweets on top of that,

18
00:01:02.871 --> 00:01:06.860
I just saw as of the day, we're taping this today, um, that they're going to,

19
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.860
they're considering doing a tip thing on Twitter. Have you heard about this?

20
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.770
But think how dangerous that means. That's an interesting idea,

21
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.020
but now they're also saying they can throttle you,

22
00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:18.170
but then that means they can also not just control who,

23
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.170
whose information gets out there, but who can actually make money too.

24
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.840
So it's a serious heat. Interesting. All that being said,

25
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.040
when it comes to big tech,

26
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.310
as someone that's in this as a creator and a YouTuber and a Twitter and a booed

27
00:01:28.311 --> 00:01:30.350
person and all that stuff, um,

28
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.090
where are you on regulation and what we should do about this, this thing,

29
00:01:35.091 --> 00:01:37.100
that's obviously pretty intimate.

30
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.450
<v 0>So I had to think a lot about this. And I was always,</v>

31
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.650
that was one area.

32
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.690
It just intersects with a lot of my interests is big tech free speech.

33
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.930
I'm like, Oh, this is going to be real interesting in the future.

34
00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:54.890
And we'll see how well that holds up because free markets,

35
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.940
big tech and free speech often do not, you know,

36
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.810
get along very well because they have an interest to their,

37
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.730
obviously to their investors. And then you have things happening on Patrion,

38
00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:10.520
like the actual financial backings,

39
00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:14.000
like MasterCard kind of putting the pressure on to boot people.

40
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:17.390
And now there are so many different topics,

41
00:02:17.391 --> 00:02:21.170
but I don't believe everyone has a right to a platform. So I just,

42
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.840
I don't think that everyone has a right to free speech in America. If in,

43
00:02:25.841 --> 00:02:29.270
in the places where you are allowed to have free speech,

44
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.870
that doesn't mean that a private public square meaning the public square.

45
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.670
Now that doesn't mean that a private company owes you a

46
00:02:37.671 --> 00:02:38.600
microphone. Yeah.

47
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.650
<v 1>So what about the people that say, but, but Twitter and Facebook and YouTube.</v>

48
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.080
<v 0>Are the avenues we communicate.</v>

49
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.520
<v 1>And if they're, if you're not allowed on there,</v>

50
00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:49.130
it's like saying to somebody 30 years ago, you, you can't get a telephone.

51
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.780
<v 0>You know, what's interesting to me is that it's generally people,</v>

52
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.850
um, on the left who are saying, this are on the right, who are getting kind of,

53
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.370
but on the left it's like, get them all off Panama. It's not the public square,

54
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.300
but I think that wa it hurts, um,

55
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.570
really marginalized people, the most, the trickle down.

56
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.980
And so I don't know it to not consider it.

57
00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:17.980
The public square is dangerous in some ways,

58
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.130
because then you are really, it's like,

59
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.220
but it's the, it's just so crazy. And it's just,

60
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.650
it goes to show how you're not gay because you

61
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:37.060
don't think the right way someone is isn't black.

62
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:39.520
If they don't think the right way, it's the ideology.

63
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:42.070
So if you have the right ideology,

64
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:45.190
you'll be allowed in the public square while that's not the public square,

65
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.020
but it is weird with Facebook and all these places. Because, um,

66
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.850
as far as I'm concerned, just being that they're private companies,

67
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:57.730
even if they were smart enough to create a public square,

68
00:03:57.731 --> 00:04:00.310
they still get to do what they want to do. I mean,

69
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.240
I don't know what else to say about that. That's just, that sucks.

70
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.580
<v 1>The best line I heard on this,</v>

71
00:04:05.581 --> 00:04:09.150
and this was in the middle of me trying to figure out how I wanted to fight this

72
00:04:09.151 --> 00:04:11.520
battle was everyone always says,

73
00:04:11.521 --> 00:04:14.430
but this time they have so much power that it's different.

74
00:04:14.431 --> 00:04:17.280
So the idea would be that this time you libertarians, you kind of have to,

75
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.910
you have to put it aside and let the government do it because this is because

76
00:04:20.911 --> 00:04:23.580
Google has so much information so much, or this is the time.

77
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.740
And then you're on Brookwood I've had on who you have.

78
00:04:25.741 --> 00:04:28.680
You chatted with your own. You, you should definitely have him on, um,

79
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.740
from the Iran Institute, basically. I mean, it's the most simple thing,

80
00:04:31.741 --> 00:04:34.800
but he said, it's so plainly as if it was nothing that it really just struck me.

81
00:04:34.801 --> 00:04:36.990
He's like, well, if you wouldn't have principals,

82
00:04:36.991 --> 00:04:38.970
when they're the hardest time to have those principles,

83
00:04:38.971 --> 00:04:42.810
then you don't really have them. And so he's completely against, uh,

84
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.010
regulations. So that leads me to why over the last year, uh,

85
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.410
and I just announced it with barely a month ago,

86
00:04:49.411 --> 00:04:54.180
I started locals.com to allow creators to own everything that they're doing own

87
00:04:54.181 --> 00:04:57.690
all your content own, all of your user data set,

88
00:04:57.691 --> 00:05:00.780
whatever rules you want in your locals. We started mine,

89
00:05:00.781 --> 00:05:03.870
which we have about 10,000 people in there now@rubinreport.com.

90
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.670
And we got an iOS app and a Google play,

91
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.750
but I'm not pimping myself out here bridge it because this all leads.

92
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.910
<v 0>To that. We are.</v>

93
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.880
<v 1>Pimping digits, boobs. No that you,</v>

94
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.830
this is the first time it's being said publicly.

95
00:05:16.831 --> 00:05:20.340
You are the first creator on locals.

96
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.280
People can go to [inaudible] dot com today.

97
00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:28.200
P H E T S a Y E P H E

98
00:05:28.201 --> 00:05:31.050
T a S Y. Yeah. Yeah. Is that what I said?

99
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.040
<v 0>No, you said it say, that's fine. It's confusing dyslexia there.</v>

100
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.530
We'll put it on the screen.

101
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.390
<v 1>You are the first, you are the first creator beyond me.</v>

102
00:05:39.391 --> 00:05:42.960
That is on locals.com and we're super psyched to have you there.

103
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.340
And we had literally about 5,000 people that reached out that within that first

104
00:05:47.341 --> 00:05:50.880
couple of weeks to create communities. And I was like Bridget, to the right one,

105
00:05:50.881 --> 00:05:54.600
because you are just in the center of all of this. So I'm thrilled to tell that.

106
00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.640
<v 0>Honored to be here. I'm so excited.</v>

107
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.890
I'm excited because while there's a couple of many reasons, one,

108
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.940
you put your money where your mouth is, you know, a lot. I appreciate that.

109
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:08.570
A lot of people, when I was, I was too small to really,

110
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.450
I was affected by people like, uh,

111
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.780
Jordan and you and Sam leaving Patrion,

112
00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:18.710
because you took a lot of people who, who subscribed to me.

113
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.800
I had my own friends angry at me that were like, if you left.

114
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.240
<v 1>Then it's okay. But, but people cancel their patriotic counts because of us.</v>

115
00:06:25.241 --> 00:06:26.350
So then a lot of you guys got it.

116
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.670
<v 0>It's fine. Whatever. And again, I don't, I really don't like to be the,</v>

117
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.510
you know, the victimy thing. So even I'm like, all right, shadow banned me.

118
00:06:34.511 --> 00:06:39.160
All right, whatever. I'll figure out a way, because I always have,

119
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.180
you actually did figure out a way and made something.

120
00:06:43.181 --> 00:06:46.510
And a lot of people are like, well, go make your own internet. They're like,

121
00:06:46.511 --> 00:06:50.650
okay, fine. I will go make my own, you know, play. It's not a platform though,

122
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:51.160
isn't it?

123
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.250
<v 1>Well, it's, it's a, it's a non platform platform.</v>

124
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.590
It's a creator specific platform.

125
00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.710
And one of the cool things that we're going to be launching over the next couple

126
00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:02.290
of months, now that we're adding some creators. And you're just the first of a,

127
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.770
of a whole bunch of people that we're going to add is that we're going to be

128
00:07:05.771 --> 00:07:07.340
able to connect our communities.

129
00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:10.120
So you'll be able to connect your community with like-minded people.

130
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.240
So perhaps if, uh, Dave and Bridget, like each other,

131
00:07:13.241 --> 00:07:14.770
we'll connect our communities, it'll,

132
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.160
it'll strengthen our feeds and our fans will be able to communicate with each

133
00:07:18.161 --> 00:07:21.190
other. And if one day you're like that day, Rubin's real.

134
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:25.390
You'll just disconnect the connection and that's it. Um,

135
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.430
and the idea was,

136
00:07:27.431 --> 00:07:31.420
let's give all of the power back to the creators that make sure that the day,

137
00:07:31.421 --> 00:07:35.380
that the day that you say something on dumpster fire, that YouTube is.

138
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.080
<v 0>Like, we're done with this girl. Well.</v>

139
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.120
<v 1>Guess what? You don't have any of, I mean,</v>

140
00:07:40.121 --> 00:07:43.600
think how many subscribers you have on a YouTube rebel.

141
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.100
<v 0>Oh, I mean, I've only been on for like three months, so 11,000 about.</v>

142
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.180
<v 1>The day that they find you too much of a threat or whatever.</v>

143
00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:53.380
And hopefully by the end of.

144
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.810
<v 0>This, by the end of this show, we're going to, we're going to send.</v>

145
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.160
<v 1>Some subscribers your way. But,</v>

146
00:07:57.161 --> 00:08:01.540
but the point is that you have no way of communicating with those 11,000 people.

147
00:08:01.541 --> 00:08:01.750
They've.

148
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.060
<v 0>Chosen to subscribe to your channel, but you can't.</v>

149
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.620
<v 1>Get your message out to them because the algorithm sits between you and getting</v>

150
00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:11.620
a message out to them. This gets adequate. I wish I had my phone on me.

151
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:15.120
You get actual push notifications on your phone. So I think we've built some.

152
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:20.170
<v 0>No, it's amazing. I'm excited. I'm so excited. I'm excited. I,</v>

153
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:24.280
I was telling David that I cried when I saw that. Yes, your David,

154
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.570
uh, that I cried when I saw it. Just the,

155
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:33.430
the S because it's just fantasy. So I started,

156
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:37.480
I made up the word fantasy years ago because,

157
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.610
and it means when reality becomes parody now in 2006, this didn't mean anything.

158
00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:46.570
And now it's like, the culture has kind of caught up to the word. And then,

159
00:08:46.571 --> 00:08:48.220
because social media was so new,

160
00:08:48.221 --> 00:08:52.240
I used it as my social media name because they didn't really trust social media

161
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:55.710
and knew nothing about it. And I didn't. Um,

162
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.380
and I wanted to get the word out. Well,

163
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:03.150
I inadvertently became the brand before my company did,

164
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:06.900
because my company went bankrupt because I was 27 and didn't have a business

165
00:09:06.901 --> 00:09:09.540
plan. I was going to make greeting cards again,

166
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:12.690
trying to just be a voice for people. I felt like didn't have a voice,

167
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.230
which was like divorced people and people who had kids out of wedlock. And,

168
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.050
and that's where I started. And then, um,

169
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.680
and then it took on a whole other life of its own, which is a crazy journey.

170
00:09:22.681 --> 00:09:27.030
And probably the book I should write because it's been, and then I saw it,

171
00:09:27.031 --> 00:09:31.300
you know, just fantasy back with the original logo. And I'm like, we, we,

172
00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.060
I never gave up on this.

173
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.260
<v 1>I have it on my phone. It's only it's the test version, but.</v>

174
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.870
<v 0>Always meant to be a content creation. That's all I want.</v>

175
00:09:41.871 --> 00:09:45.890
I wanted to be a production company. And two, I, like I said, I mean,

176
00:09:45.891 --> 00:09:47.900
I w I have scripted podcasts. I want to make,

177
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.350
I have locals only content that I want to put on. And,

178
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.330
and I see locals now,

179
00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.660
or the fetisi locals as my hub,

180
00:09:56.661 --> 00:10:00.560
where I get to do that and just keep expanding and collecting people as long as

181
00:10:00.561 --> 00:10:02.600
I'm allowed in the public forum. Yeah.

182
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:06.020
<v 1>Yeah. But it's the home. I mean, what I'm trying to tell people is it's the,</v>

183
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:09.320
it's your digital home. You do whatever you want and your digital home,

184
00:10:09.321 --> 00:10:11.390
you can't, you know, our tos, our terms of service,

185
00:10:11.391 --> 00:10:14.600
you can't break the laws of the United States across the board on locals.

186
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.530
But beyond that, one of the cool things is you set the rules in your locals.

187
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.850
I set the rules in my local. So if someone's just being purely evil in mine,

188
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.760
I just don't want your money and goodbye. You're out.

189
00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.000
You may have a different policy related to what you,

190
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:32.660
what you're reading and mine. It's sorta, I wrote in, into kind of funny way.

191
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:34.730
It's like, it's not that I have three strikes. It's just like,

192
00:10:34.731 --> 00:10:37.790
don't be a relentless Dick. And if you, if you just can't do that,

193
00:10:37.791 --> 00:10:40.250
then I don't want, I don't, I literally don't want your money.

194
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.630
<v 0>I mean, that's how I feel. It's I call it my, um, gated community.</v>

195
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.620
<v 1>Yeah. Congratulations. The new, well, the new institutions are being built.</v>

196
00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:49.730
What do you think though?

197
00:10:49.731 --> 00:10:54.020
Because we're doing this as a subscription thing about that may be the day of

198
00:10:54.021 --> 00:10:58.550
the absolutely free internet being the main driving force of everything is kind

199
00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.860
of done. Cause that's sorta what I'm feeling like. Yes, I get it.

200
00:11:00.861 --> 00:11:03.770
I'm not leaving YouTube or Twitter or any of those things for discovery,

201
00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.680
but well, they just stole your soul. But besides.

202
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:08.030
<v 0>I always say on Twitter,</v>

203
00:11:08.031 --> 00:11:10.340
I'm like Twitter takes your soul and all your information.

204
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:14.720
So one of the things I love about yours is that I take that stuff. I'm not,

205
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:17.900
I am not, I have no interest in selling information.

206
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:19.970
People give me to third parties, none.

207
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.900
I don't like it when other places do that to me, I have no interest in that.

208
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:27.140
If I shut down and die at all, dies with me.

209
00:11:27.141 --> 00:11:30.320
That's also very clearly written for my partners. You know,

210
00:11:30.321 --> 00:11:34.100
like I don't want them taking it and selling it. And I just,

211
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.190
I think that the, you know, I was saying,

212
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:42.200
as I was watching all of the past couple of

213
00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:42.711
years,

214
00:11:42.711 --> 00:11:47.390
the debates and the siloing of public and private

215
00:11:47.391 --> 00:11:49.910
opinion is happening anyway. And I was saying,

216
00:11:49.911 --> 00:11:52.190
everyone's going to end up going back to their domain names.

217
00:11:52.191 --> 00:11:55.780
Everybody left their domain names to go into these, you know,

218
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.310
social media places.

219
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.420
And now everyone's going to start kind of reverting back to those places, their,

220
00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.370
their homes, their home pages. Do you think that that's part of the problem,

221
00:12:05.371 --> 00:12:09.400
you found a way to link them all and be social. So it's the future.

222
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:14.350
It's the future. It's amazing. Um, I'm psyched about, it's amazing.

223
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:18.220
I mean, I, when I saw, when you guys showed me the demo, I was like the,

224
00:12:18.221 --> 00:12:20.380
I got in the car with cousin Maggie, and we're like,

225
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:25.090
this is the future because it's social media meets, you know, content creation.

226
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.290
It's like Patrion meets Twitter a little bit and it scrolls and it's

227
00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:31.360
sexy. It's just, I'm so good.
