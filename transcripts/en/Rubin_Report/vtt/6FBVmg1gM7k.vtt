WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 0>When she goes and tells all the Muslims that the Americans hate us,</v>

2
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.570
the white people hate us and they are so anti-US limits. And that, that, uh,

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.610
the Islamophobe, that the term that was invented by care. Yeah.

4
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.480
<v 1>So we've talked about this, a bunch on the show,</v>

5
00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:21.770
but can you explain why the term specifically Islamophobia was invented and why

6
00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:23.390
it's such a confusing term.

7
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.420
<v 0>Counterpart the antisemitism?</v>

8
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.150
So it's easier to say Islamophobe, so you could, okay.

9
00:00:32.151 --> 00:00:36.020
If you are an Islamophobe, uh,

10
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.100
that's why you're with, uh,

11
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.260
with others that hate all the Muslims in the United States.

12
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.610
Well, number one, if they hated all the Muslims, um,

13
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.350
I've been here three decades as an adult. How come nobody hated.

14
00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.660
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.530
<v 0>To her district.</v>

16
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.510
And I spoke to the people and I was going back and forth,

17
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.530
back and forth spending time there. And even sometimes on Twitter,

18
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.720
I would say, I'm going to be in this place from this time to come and meet me,

19
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.160
journalists and others.

20
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.110
So I had all this research about this district way

21
00:01:21.111 --> 00:01:22.940
before anything else.

22
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.770
And then six months ago I decided to move there.

23
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.030
Uh, and I started thinking that

24
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.800
if I run, I would be the best,

25
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.810
the only candidate that could beat her because of my background.

26
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.980
I'm immune to her, uh, uh, brand of identity politics.

27
00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:50.480
So I can push straight for the important issues and

28
00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:51.950
important discussions.

29
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.760
And I'm not a shy person at all.

30
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.870
And I could say you are one, two, three.

31
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.920
Why did you meet Turkish president Erdogan before you were elected?

32
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.830
What promises did you, uh,

33
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.630
did you give him why you refuse to acknowledge the, the, uh,

34
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.680
Turkish ethnic cleansing against the Armenians?

35
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.100
Why were you outraged?

36
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.440
Because president Trump decided to take justice

37
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.690
to custom Soleimani. Why are you close to the Muslim brotherhood?

38
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.490
How much money have you been getting from

39
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.560
care through? Oh,

40
00:02:36.561 --> 00:02:41.390
through care from Qatar and from the godfather of the Muslim brotherhood

41
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.160
I could do what no other candidates could

42
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.540
basically,

43
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.040
because if you tell her this you're a white supremacist. Yeah.

44
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.660
Oh yeah. You're a Thai Muslim. She cannot accuse me of that.

45
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.580
<v 1>So you have it, I'm sure she will accuse you of it.</v>

46
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.780
<v 0>Yes. Because I'm not very credible because I grew</v>

47
00:03:06.781 --> 00:03:08.070
up in, uh,

48
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.870
probably I know more about religion than she does most likely.

49
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.190
Yeah. Um.

50
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.730
<v 1>She's using religion as a shield.</v>

51
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.040
<v 0>She's using everything and she has this, uh,</v>

52
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.210
victim cards that she throws at you. Oh, I was five.

53
00:03:27.211 --> 00:03:31.530
I have PTSD. I was five years old. And,

54
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.210
uh, uh,

55
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.770
no girls should live at war because any war and everywhere

56
00:03:37.771 --> 00:03:42.450
around the globe is because of the United States. So,

57
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:44.860
uh, what can you tell.

58
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.910
<v 1>Talk a little bit about the tactics. So you mentioned this, uh,</v>

59
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.760
Muslim brotherhood care connection. We mentioned,

60
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.890
we talked briefly before we started about Bridgette Gabriel.

61
00:03:52.891 --> 00:03:55.380
Who's really been laying this thing out for years.

62
00:03:55.381 --> 00:03:56.760
What the plan is to infiltrate.

63
00:03:56.761 --> 00:03:59.760
You're now saying there's over a hundred candidates that are being groomed by

64
00:03:59.761 --> 00:04:01.920
them. But I think one of the tactics,

65
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.780
which you sort of hit on is this constant desire to make everything feel crazy

66
00:04:06.781 --> 00:04:09.570
all the time. And it almost seems like every time, uh,

67
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.770
to lead in a way where she is,

68
00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:15.150
who he is almost worse than Ilhan and this way that everything she says seems to

69
00:04:15.151 --> 00:04:19.160
be designed to make maximum chaos. And,

70
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.480
and is that really part of what they do?

71
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.150
<v 0>That's the main thing that they do and that's how they get support.</v>

72
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.040
I mean, enhan, Omar or Rashida Labe, uh, um, uh,

73
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.040
let me talk about each one because they have similar tactics,

74
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.250
but on different issues, like Ilhan Omar,

75
00:04:38.251 --> 00:04:42.120
when she keeps feeding, uh, uh,

76
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.160
or tweeting or,

77
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.360
or saying the same narrative over and over and over, uh,

78
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.940
that I represent every Muslim, uh,

79
00:04:52.941 --> 00:04:57.600
in the country first, she supposed to represent the fifth district.

80
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.960
She's supposed to serve the,

81
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.670
the fifth district and she's done zero nada,

82
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:06.773
nothing.

83
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.360
So when she goes and tells all the Muslims that the Americans hate us,

84
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.370
the white people hate us and they are so anti-Islamic. And that, that, uh,

85
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.410
the Islamophobe, that, the term that was invented by care. Yeah.

86
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.970
So.

87
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.260
<v 1>Well, we've talked about this, a bunch on the show,</v>

88
00:05:25.261 --> 00:05:29.580
but can you explain why the term specifically Islamophobia was invented and why

89
00:05:29.581 --> 00:05:31.200
it's such a confusing term.

90
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.230
<v 0>Counterpart the antisemitism?</v>

91
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.960
So it's easier to say Islamophobe so you could, okay.

92
00:05:39.961 --> 00:05:43.830
If you are an Islamophobe, uh,

93
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.910
that's why you're with, uh,

94
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.070
with others that hate all the Muslims in the United States.

95
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.410
Well, number one, if they hated all the Muslims, um,

96
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.570
I've been here three decades as an adult. How come nobody hated me?

97
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.060
Well, I'm sure they hate me.

98
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.570
<v 1>People probably hate you for your ideas. Now,</v>

99
00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:08.830
Ilhan is probably not thrilled with you.

100
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.670
<v 0>Um, I doubt that, but, uh,</v>

101
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.130
even after nine 11, like nine 12,

102
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.280
I w I've never felt threatened because I was a Muslim. I'm an American,

103
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.850
regardless of all these, I don't use this. And the problem is,

104
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.160
or I'm forced to use a Muslim from a refugee immigrants just

105
00:06:33.161 --> 00:06:37.510
to, uh, uh, the identity politics that she uses.

106
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.900
And I stated it once on Twitter,

107
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.500
that was picked up by everybody, because she said,

108
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.860
I am a hijab, which is,

109
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:52.690
that is not the right hijab that she claims to. And I've spoken to,

110
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.870
uh, several, uh, uh,

111
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.710
American Somalis that this is not the Muslim hijab. I mean,

112
00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:03.700
she wears the hijab regard, uh, based on the people that she's meeting,

113
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.960
she's meeting Muslim, she would cover, but hijab as an hijab,

114
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:12.190
you cannot show your chest. You cannot show your hands. It's it's,

115
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.820
it's all it's. It was limbs. Know that.

116
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:16.240
<v 1>Right.</v>

117
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.290
Well also plenty of the policies that she's for would not be policies that if

118
00:07:20.291 --> 00:07:24.370
you were a strict Muslim, you would be for help. Abortion is a right.

119
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.100
Yes. Sorry. Abortion is healthcare.

120
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.210
<v 0>And it's human rights as well. So, uh,</v>

121
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:35.830
but the problem with the people in the district that they don't follow

122
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:41.110
what she does, uh, MDC on a daily basis.

123
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.340
They don't know that she missed half, uh,

124
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:49.480
half of the votes that anyone else in the house,

125
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.500
she doesn't vote for the district. You know, when she votes,

126
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:57.640
when it comes to foreign policies, that's when her votes.

127
00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:02.800
And can you believe that she voted against sending,

128
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.580
uh, AIDS to, to so much some money.

129
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:12.100
And then she went outside 10 minutes later giving a press conference

130
00:08:12.101 --> 00:08:13.420
saying, Oh, we did it.

131
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.490
I mean, this woman is filled with lies. And again,

132
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.520
her worst, um, uh,

133
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.370
mistake that she didn't give me the interview,

134
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.490
that what made me go back and forth in that,

135
00:08:30.491 --> 00:08:34.930
what made me decide that I am going to cross the line

136
00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:39.430
between being a journalist to a, a politician.

137
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.780
<v 1>So what are some of the other tactics that they use besides the just general</v>

138
00:08:43.781 --> 00:08:47.260
there they want to cause chaos all the time and seem to always everything they

139
00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:50.350
say seems to be designed to deepen that divide. What else,

140
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:51.340
what else are they doing?

141
00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:55.740
<v 0>Handouts that it, on reality does work.</v>

142
00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:01.080
How could you give free healthcare to everybody?

143
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.210
It doesn't work this way. I mean, what would they get the money from?

144
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.530
How could you forgive all the student loans?

145
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.910
What would they do for people that already paid their loans?

146
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.610
<v 1>Yeah. We're not getting anything back or know.</v>

147
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:23.190
<v 0>How, I mean all these handouts and like free this and free this I'm,</v>

148
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.940
everybody's going to have a free house and it's going to have a friend. I mean,

149
00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:31.650
this is ridiculous. We are not in China. And even in China,

150
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.780
uh, they don't do that.

151
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:34.461
<v 1>So,</v>

152
00:09:34.461 --> 00:09:38.240
but can you explain a little bit more how the Islamists and care and Mo and the

153
00:09:38.241 --> 00:09:41.090
Muslim brotherhood, how they use the Progressive's like, it's like,

154
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:42.350
cause this is what I think a lot of people,

155
00:09:42.351 --> 00:09:43.970
a lot of people see this match made in hell.

156
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.830
You're supposed to be PR for progressive,

157
00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.680
but all these other values are completely anti progressive,

158
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:53.270
but I don't think people really understand how this thing fully ties together.

159
00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.980
<v 0>The progressive don't have minds, their right minds,</v>

160
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:02.600
the Muslim brotherhood is using the far left and the

161
00:10:02.601 --> 00:10:06.650
progressive for their own, uh, adjectives.

162
00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.960
They're not doing it for the sake of the far left or the sake

163
00:10:11.961 --> 00:10:15.350
of progressive. No, they are using them big time.

164
00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:19.130
<v 1>If you're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations about politics,</v>

165
00:10:19.131 --> 00:10:22.490
instead of nonstop yelling, checkout our politics playlist.

166
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.430
And if you want to watch full interviews on a variety of topics,
