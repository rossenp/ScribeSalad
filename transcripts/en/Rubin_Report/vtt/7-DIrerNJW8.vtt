1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.790
<v 0>You should definitely be sampling both sides of the news.</v>

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.710
If you're not looking at Fox news and CNN, you don't know what's happening.

3
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:12.380
<v 1>So.</v>

4
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.100
<v 2>Trapped in your bubble, and it's becoming a self fulfilling prophecy.</v>

5
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.850
What's the first step to breaking out of your loser thing.

6
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.270
<v 0>Well, it's good to know what all the various parts of loser think are.</v>

7
00:00:23.271 --> 00:00:25.400
And I go through them like, don't be a mind reader.

8
00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:27.800
Don't predict the future with analogies history.

9
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.130
Doesn't predict the slippery slope. Isn't a real, yeah, fair.

10
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.200
<v 2>Enough. I want to go through a few of them.</v>

11
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.740
<v 0>Without details. So it's good to know what those are, but beyond that,</v>

12
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.890
you should definitely be sampling both sides of the news.

13
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.250
If you're not looking at Fox news and CNN,

14
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.160
you don't know what's happening because I've tried doing that.

15
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.370
Try to pick a topic. And before you've heard what the other says,

16
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.660
just consume one silo, and then you go over to the other one. And you're like,

17
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.200
what? I didn't know anybody was saying, this,

18
00:00:57.201 --> 00:00:59.990
are you telling me these facts are real and it doesn't matter which way you're

19
00:00:59.991 --> 00:01:01.550
going. They're completely different.

20
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.280
<v 2>But is it almost impossible to break out of that? I mean,</v>

21
00:01:04.281 --> 00:01:06.770
we all talk about this all the time. We're catering news to ourselves.

22
00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:10.910
The algorithms are feeding us things that reinforce our thoughts already,

23
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.030
but is it almost impossible to break out of it? Because in a weird way,

24
00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:17.150
psychologically, we don't want to break out of it. I know some people do,

25
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.620
but that most of us kind of, we just, you know, it's not sound corny.

26
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.250
We that's the safe space we find and we're good and we're reinforced and it's

27
00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:26.084
warm. And.

28
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.300
<v 0>This is why I sort of sneak in the back door. If I said to you, Dave,</v>

29
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.020
I'm going to get you to change teams, whatever your team is, Democrat,

30
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.680
Republican doesn't matter. You would immediately say, or, you know,

31
00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:40.220
you'd be like, everything you shooting at me is bouncing off my field.

32
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.810
But if I say here's how you should think in the, you know,

33
00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:48.590
in any situation you want to have something to compare something to a very

34
00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:52.640
simple statement. People accept that. Cause that's just, you know,

35
00:01:52.641 --> 00:01:55.880
reasonable on its surface. And then you take that through. All right, now,

36
00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:57.140
apply this to your thinking.

37
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.430
So you can sometimes get people to talk themselves out of their position by

38
00:02:01.431 --> 00:02:02.570
giving them better tools.

39
00:02:02.571 --> 00:02:05.450
But you can't just say change teams because you're on the wrong team.

40
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.110
<v 2>How much of this do you think is just base human psychology?</v>

41
00:02:09.111 --> 00:02:12.710
Just sort of the stuff we're born with that certain people are just sort of more

42
00:02:12.711 --> 00:02:17.240
programmed to go to just things that reinforce their beliefs.

43
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.200
And some people are just programmed to actually being a little bit more open.

44
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.120
<v 0>I think all of these things have a, you know,</v>

45
00:02:23.121 --> 00:02:26.570
you're born with a certain set of gifts and intelligence, et cetera,

46
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.930
but in loser, think I talk about how, uh, your,

47
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.310
the experience you've had across domains is what gives you better vision.

48
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.450
So for example, if you'd never, um, been exposed to economics,

49
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.680
I've got a degree in economics. You wouldn't know how economists think.

50
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.010
So you might run into a concept like a sunk cost.

51
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.130
And if you'd never been exposed to this, you might say, well,

52
00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:52.610
I have common sense. And people would say, we've already spent all this money.

53
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.000
So we better keep investing because I don't want to waste that money I already

54
00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:59.890
spent. That's not sensible. And economists say, no,

55
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:04.150
the money that's gone should not influence your next decision because it's gone.

56
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.530
Now, the first time you hear that, you say, Oh yeah,

57
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.290
like you don't need to read a book on it. You just hear it.

58
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.900
And so I tried to make it as simple as that.

59
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:17.020
You just got to hear it once and then you say, Oh yeah, that makes sense.

60
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.420
<v 2>Yeah. So you don't think,</v>

61
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.310
so you think we all have sort of pre-programmed abilities to be flexible on some

62
00:03:23.311 --> 00:03:23.990
of these things, but,

63
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.850
but you think that that can pretty much always be different levels.

64
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.220
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. I mean,</v>

65
00:03:29.221 --> 00:03:32.730
people are more or less locked in more or less team players,

66
00:03:32.731 --> 00:03:37.230
more or less capable of, you know, looking at details and thinking properly,

67
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.213
but everybody can do.

68
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:39.090
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

69
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.690
Do you think the Internet's changing that just relative to the speed that we get

70
00:03:42.691 --> 00:03:47.520
information and the fact that you can now go out there and find roughly a

71
00:03:47.521 --> 00:03:51.810
good Jillian voices in two minutes that might be able to help break some of your

72
00:03:51.811 --> 00:03:52.390
stuff. Okay.

73
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.940
<v 0>Tell you the biggest problem. I think,</v>

74
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.530
and this is a brand new thought is that we are as humans,

75
00:03:58.531 --> 00:04:02.370
we're copiers or imitators. So if you wait until the internet,

76
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.850
what kind of thinking style are you going to see the worst?

77
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.940
And people will imitate it. So they'll say, for example, Hey,

78
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.740
your side did X and what's the most common response your side did that.

79
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.780
What did that help? That help? Nothing. There wasn't even on the topic,

80
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.000
you didn't even talk about, you're talking. If they're going to do it,

81
00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:24.090
we have to do it. Right. So some of it is of course,

82
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.230
power and influence and persuasion and all that. And nobody's trying to think,

83
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.450
so you have to, you have to be able to weed out. Okay.

84
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.570
Was anybody even trying or are they just persuading?

85
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.290
<v 2>Yeah. Do you think most of us just don't want to try though at some level,</v>

86
00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:38.550
I mean, most people just kind of,

87
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.120
they don't want to think about beings that seriously,

88
00:04:42.121 --> 00:04:44.850
because that brings up a lot of deep existential stuff.

89
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.520
<v 0>Yeah. Maybe, maybe,</v>

90
00:04:46.521 --> 00:04:48.960
maybe there's there are lots of reasons we don't want to be wrong.

91
00:04:48.961 --> 00:04:51.540
We don't like to be embarrassed. We don't like to change your mind.

92
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.860
We don't want to disappoint the team and we're influenced by what we see.

93
00:04:55.861 --> 00:04:58.470
So we just join in and say, well, that's what my team's doing.

94
00:04:58.471 --> 00:04:59.304
I guess I'll do something.

95
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.680
<v 2>So you talk about, uh, some of the dumb ideas that are floating around. So,</v>

96
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.080
uh, that thus create our own bubbles.

97
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.120
So I wanted to go through a couple of them, uh,

98
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.640
cause we hear these all the time and they sorta sound right,

99
00:05:11.641 --> 00:05:14.160
but you don't quite think they are. Right. Uh,

100
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.520
we know when history will repeat itself. And when it won't,

101
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.240
we hear this all the time, history repeats, history repeats itself.

102
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.480
<v 0>And because it has a phrase and we've heard the phrase,</v>

103
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.110
we give it weight because the brain will say, well, it's a saying,

104
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.320
I'm pretty sure I've seen that on a bumper sticker.

105
00:05:31.321 --> 00:05:32.880
So there must be something about that.

106
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.990
But it's an illusion caused by the fact that we don't notice when history

107
00:05:36.991 --> 00:05:39.600
doesn't repeat, which is most of the time.

108
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.810
And why is it the history doesn't repeat because it can't,

109
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.110
there's never two situations that it was named, the variables have changed.

110
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.430
And if nothing else has changed, you saw what, what went wrong the last time.

111
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.170
So you, so you fix it this time.

112
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.790
So it's a complete illusion that we can predict the future because this time is

113
00:05:56.791 --> 00:06:01.730
like that last time the most you can do is say, people are still selfish,

114
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.040
stupid. It, all those things.

115
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.240
So if you put it in a situation where they can steal, well sure. They'll steal.

116
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.860
You know, not everybody,

117
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:13.160
but if you have enough people introduced to a situation where you can steal

118
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:15.290
something, somebody is going to take a run at it,

119
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.940
but that's not really history repeating.

120
00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.380
<v 2>You would say a better way to say it would be something like themes repeat</v>

121
00:06:20.381 --> 00:06:22.990
themselves. Just because, because it's based in our nature,

122
00:06:22.991 --> 00:06:24.100
not the specific event.

123
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.220
<v 0>I would even make it smaller than that. I would say people are people.</v>

124
00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.230
So w you know, they're going to be selfish and all the qualities of people.

125
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.100
So any situation you put it in, put that in, you should say, well,

126
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.360
let's look at cause and effect. If I put that person where the free money is,

127
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.820
you know, I should expect money to be taken, but not because history repeats.

128
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.350
It's just a simple cause and effect.

129
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:48.910
<v 2>So if it doesn't repeat itself,</v>

130
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.090
what would you say to all the history majors right now that are listening to

131
00:06:52.091 --> 00:06:56.620
this? Well, what would be the point of being a historian? If not,

132
00:06:56.621 --> 00:06:58.420
to have some sort of roadmap for the future, right?

133
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:03.070
<v 0>Well, indeed the history is what a preventive from repeating, in some sense,</v>

134
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.540
because you'd know what didn't work.

135
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:09.820
So you might see history repeat when it works. So if something worked before,

136
00:07:09.821 --> 00:07:11.590
you might see somebody try to try it again.

137
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.040
But even you take anything like North Korea, right?

138
00:07:15.041 --> 00:07:18.940
What was the main thing people said when president Trump got elected was well

139
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:22.720
talking to North, Korea will never work, blah, blah, blah. And maybe it won't,

140
00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.440
but he got it further than anybody else. He got it into a personal level.

141
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.570
It wasn't anything like history.

142
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.180
So no matter how many times history had repeated,

143
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.260
you introduced this whole new variable of president Trump and then history

144
00:07:35.261 --> 00:07:36.310
doesn't count anymore.

145
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.960
<v 2>Can you make it that concept that people who said one thing two years ago say</v>

146
00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:43.630
the complete opposite. And I, I don't mean, um,

147
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.570
that they've flipped all their beliefs, but that it's always a team thing.

148
00:07:46.571 --> 00:07:50.170
You know, it's like if, if Obama had talked to, uh,

149
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.390
gone to North Korea and talked to Kim Jong and they, you know,

150
00:07:52.391 --> 00:07:55.180
a certain set of people, the Republicans in this case would have been like,

151
00:07:55.181 --> 00:07:58.120
he's crazy. We can't talk to these people. Trump does it. We can't do it.

152
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.640
You can flip that the other way. I mean, that, th that,

153
00:08:00.641 --> 00:08:02.560
I guess that goes to what you're saying about the team thing.

154
00:08:02.561 --> 00:08:06.370
But do you think people realize the sort of absurdly I'm not talking about

155
00:08:06.371 --> 00:08:10.120
evolving over a period of time with certain set of opinions I'm talking to that

156
00:08:10.121 --> 00:08:13.590
because of the players are different, that you just completely taken opposite.

157
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:13.811
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

158
00:08:13.811 --> 00:08:17.050
One of the great mysteries is you watch somebody who doesn't agree with you,

159
00:08:17.051 --> 00:08:19.840
and they're doing that crazy thinking, like you mentioned,

160
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:24.220
and you watch them and you think to yourself, is that real? Do they,

161
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.670
do they really think that, and I spend time doing that too,

162
00:08:27.671 --> 00:08:31.480
but one of the advantages I have is having studied hypnosis.

163
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:34.090
I understand people to be irrational most of the time,

164
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:39.580
and I understand them to be rationalizers and I understand confirmation bias and

165
00:08:39.581 --> 00:08:40.660
cognitive dissonance.

166
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:44.530
So my take is that most of the time they actually believe what they're saying.

167
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.410
And because they can't see it, you know,

168
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:48.910
they're the ones who were blinded to it.

169
00:08:48.911 --> 00:08:51.010
So it looks like it makes sense to them.

170
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:52.720
<v 2>Do you think there's some reason,</v>

171
00:08:52.721 --> 00:08:57.300
like an obvious sort of psychological reason that people who seem most obsessed

172
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.540
by politics on a day-to-day basis, and I'm not talking about like,

173
00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:03.210
sort of the broad theme stuff, but as you said before,

174
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.940
you you're really sort of uninterested in politics,

175
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.600
but the people that are obsessed with, you know, the nitty-gritty, excuse me,

176
00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:12.390
the nitty gritty, what happened today? What happened tomorrow kind of,

177
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:13.380
or what's happening tomorrow?

178
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:17.010
There's a reason that they're so miserable because it's, it's sort of like,

179
00:09:17.011 --> 00:09:19.950
it's like an untenable system that they're playing with all the time.

180
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.440
<v 0>You know, people are different. So it's probably all different reasons.</v>

181
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.310
I do a for entertainment and I think other people are drawn in from the fight.

182
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:32.450
You know, they, they like the fight. So what's my fight today. Ooh,

183
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.530
there's a new headline. Let me get into that fight. There's definitely a,

184
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.120
I don't know,

185
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.330
dopamine or serotonin in the hip that people would get just from making a good

186
00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:42.200
point. It's like, ah,

187
00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:46.730
got that guy said something bad about this celebrity got him

188
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.350
something. I think that this was a real thing.

189
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.960
<v 2>Right? Like involving weapons, they would be much more reserved.</v>

190
00:09:50.961 --> 00:09:51.794
What do you think?

191
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:53.803
<v 0>Yeah, exactly.</v>

192
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:57.260
<v 2>If you're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations about politics,</v>
