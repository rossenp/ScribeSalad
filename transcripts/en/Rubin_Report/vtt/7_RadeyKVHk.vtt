1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.960
<v 0>Both sides doing.</v>

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.460
But what we have seen over the past for years is a group of individuals from the

3
00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:10.260
FBI, from the CIA who are leaking pieces of information to kneecap,

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.520
a duly elected president,

5
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.180
so that they can put the people in power that they choose irrespective of party,

6
00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.490
whether it's a never Trumper or whether it's one of these, you know,

7
00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:20.190
more traditional, moderate Democrat, what the hell that means these days.

8
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.801
<v 2>Piece of this,</v>

9
00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:29.240
which you've sort of been hitting on here is the media portion and how all of

10
00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:30.170
these leaks,

11
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.180
every day you open up the New York times or CNN or MSNBC,

12
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.870
and they're reporting on stuff that's supposed to be behind closed doors.

13
00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:41.360
There are secret congressional meetings about things,

14
00:00:41.361 --> 00:00:45.950
but somehow MSNBC in the New York times has all of ships talking points and the

15
00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:48.770
rest of it, how does this game actually get played? Like,

16
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.320
is it as obviously ridiculous as,

17
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.100
and just so blatant as it seems, could it be that blatant?

18
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.610
<v 0>Yeah, it, it is look, um, most of the leaking so that the,</v>

19
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.380
when you work in Washington,

20
00:01:00.381 --> 00:01:05.030
you find out very quickly that most of the leaking occurs either by the white

21
00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:06.170
house, interestingly enough,

22
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.550
or by the senior levels of the various departments and agencies, it's,

23
00:01:09.551 --> 00:01:13.940
it's rarely that lower or working level individual, right?

24
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.010
It's the people who, again, like Aldrich,

25
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.410
Ames have decided that they know what's best for the country.

26
00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:21.350
So they're going to act on it. They're going to leak things to try to push, uh,

27
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.890
the media narrative and at one direction or another based on whatever they want,

28
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.700
whether their goals are their personal goals. We saw that with comi. I mean,

29
00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:32.480
we know he leaked the New York times via cut-out to try to push for an

30
00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:33.800
independent counsel and he got it.

31
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.160
So it's not as though this tactic doesn't work, it does work.

32
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.470
So that's probably that's your friend. Yes. Yeah. So, uh, both sides doing,

33
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.000
but what we have seen over the past for years is a group of individuals from the

34
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:51.800
FBI, from the CIA who are leaking pieces of information to kneecap,

35
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.190
a duly elected president so that they can put the people in power that they

36
00:01:55.191 --> 00:01:56.690
choose irrespective of party,

37
00:01:56.691 --> 00:01:59.000
whether it's a never Trumper or whether it's one of these, you know,

38
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:01.700
more traditional, moderate Democrat, where the hell that means these days.

39
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:02.600
Right. Well, it's not right.

40
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.610
<v 2>Really irrespective of party. Right? Cause it's,</v>

41
00:02:04.611 --> 00:02:07.400
you mean a never Trumper or some other Democrat.

42
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.220
<v 0>But I mean, historically the leaks have,</v>

43
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.680
have come from both sides of the aisle to,

44
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.730
to the media because of their own personal desire to shape policy. Right.

45
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.760
We're just seeing it on steroids. Now, the amount of leaking th the,

46
00:02:20.761 --> 00:02:25.160
the ferociousness of the impact of those leaks, right. That it's not just,

47
00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:28.130
we like this, or we don't like this. It's, you know, Trump is a, is a trader,

48
00:02:28.131 --> 00:02:31.310
or it's going to launch this in world war three, or it's that absurdities,

49
00:02:31.311 --> 00:02:33.830
that history that, that was kicked off in 2016.

50
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.490
<v 2>Do you think that's partly just because we're just watching institutions crumble</v>

51
00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:40.460
across the board. And so they're all sort of in their death throws,

52
00:02:40.461 --> 00:02:43.040
so you just throw out everything. So, you know what I mean?

53
00:02:43.041 --> 00:02:45.200
Like we're watching our media institutions crumble,

54
00:02:45.201 --> 00:02:46.760
our political institutions are crumbling.

55
00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:50.750
We're exposing information conversations like this weren't really being had five

56
00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:55.670
years ago. So as it all becomes more obvious, the ways it can lash out,

57
00:02:55.671 --> 00:02:56.570
become crazier.

58
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.000
<v 0>So as, as the curtain is pulled back on the wizard of Oz,</v>

59
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.850
he not get a little bit more panicked.

60
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.420
<v 2>About people understanding he was like four foot, two, 250 pounds. Yeah.</v>

61
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.640
<v 0>Yeah. I think that, that could explain a lot, because again, at some level,</v>

62
00:03:08.641 --> 00:03:11.580
when you start looking at, for instance, let's just take the media, right?

63
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.500
So it's long been known that the media focuses on one particular party and

64
00:03:16.501 --> 00:03:18.690
benefiting them. And it's a democratic party, which by the way,

65
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.460
when you get like 95% of your political funds or that,

66
00:03:22.461 --> 00:03:26.010
that is the media support you like from their political donations,

67
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.190
it's incredible that the Republican party even exists. Right.

68
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.440
We have that degree of an avalanche of support in your nation's media.

69
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.570
The fact that another party exists is really incredible.

70
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.600
<v 2>Or it means a Denver reminder. I'm looking at a lifelong Democrat.</v>

71
00:03:39.601 --> 00:03:41.910
I want to say that again. So look in.

72
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.520
<v 0>The last 10 to 15 years, forget that five.</v>

73
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.520
<v 2>Years we'll get to that. We're going to get over it. But yeah.</v>

74
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.230
<v 0>You're right to say that the media is recognizing that we're all pulling off the</v>

75
00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:53.520
mask and seen who they are,

76
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.500
and that is horrifying to them because the moment that we start questioning

77
00:03:58.501 --> 00:04:01.560
their authority to tell us what's right and wrong. And we start saying,

78
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.981
you know what,

79
00:04:01.981 --> 00:04:05.490
actually you've given to the other political party used to work for that another

80
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.910
organization or entity that is now against Trump, or like,

81
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.240
we now know that your bias and that's fine. Right?

82
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.620
You and I both have an opinion.

83
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.950
We've heard we both go on TV and talk about things in our opinions. That's fine,

84
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.530
but let's be candid about who we are and what we believe in.

85
00:04:19.531 --> 00:04:22.920
And it's not pass it as news because it's not news. It's just an opinion, right?

86
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.880
It's interesting of the former editor of New York times, uh,

87
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.060
give this fantastic interview, but she talked about her students, you know,

88
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.140
she left the New York times now,

89
00:04:31.141 --> 00:04:33.510
I believe it's at Yale or one of these fancy IVs.

90
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.290
And she works with students who want to become journalists. And she said,

91
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.390
one of the frustrations that she has is that they all want to report on their

92
00:04:42.391 --> 00:04:45.210
own opinions of what's happening in the world. Right. And not the news.

93
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.140
And it's like, well, amen.

94
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.220
We have been walking down this road for 15 plus years where everybody.

95
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.570
<v 2>In the [inaudible]. Yeah. So.</v>

96
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.300
<v 0>So let's have an honest conversation that the Walter Cronkite's are gone and</v>

97
00:04:57.301 --> 00:04:59.970
it's, and it's now, you know, a circus and it's, we,

98
00:04:59.971 --> 00:05:03.540
everybody's got a different performer that they prefer and that's bad,

99
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.300
and we should acknowledge that that's bad. And we should, I think,

100
00:05:06.301 --> 00:05:08.460
as a country and at some point, you know,

101
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.090
when does journalism ring its own bell and say, w we've gone too far.

102
00:05:12.091 --> 00:05:13.140
Let's see if we can do something different.

103
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.780
<v 2>You read the paper that was formerly the New York times.</v>

104
00:05:15.781 --> 00:05:20.460
Are there phrases that you can see are obvious tells when it's complete nonsense

105
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.850
beyond just unnamed source or source picking it up,

106
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.810
saying putting it back down? Yeah. Yeah. And by the way, as I always say,

107
00:05:27.811 --> 00:05:31.380
every time I knocked the New York times, I would prefer this not be the case.

108
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.270
Amen. Everyone, everyone does it.

109
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.750
The people that I find that are railing against it the most are the people that

110
00:05:36.751 --> 00:05:39.630
don't want this to be the most. You know what I mean? Like just,

111
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.670
don't be totally horrible. I come from.

112
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.070
<v 0>The middle of nowhere and East rural Oregon,</v>

113
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.310
the way that I was able to get into the CIA was that I went to the Washington

114
00:05:47.311 --> 00:05:49.920
post, New York times. I read it every single day,

115
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.740
back in the late nineties and early two thousands. I took notes on each stories.

116
00:05:52.741 --> 00:05:56.340
I built my knowledge and understanding of the world based on their reporting.

117
00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.830
So there was a time when I was a big fan and I appreciated what they were doing

118
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.920
for, for me, for the, for the world, for the country spreading, you know,

119
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:07.140
what was actually happening. And we've lost that great lady.

120
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.280
And the Washington post has gone even more bananas and bars.

121
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.290
And it's horrible for the Republic because democracies need that voice

122
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.810
to challenge people in power. Uh.

123
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.810
<v 2>So do you think we're more than anything else,</v>

124
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.790
but I can put a little bit political stuff aside putting,

125
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.140
putting deep state aside,

126
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:27.010
putting the parties aside that we're really more in an information war at this

127
00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:29.410
point than anything else. It's not even information,

128
00:06:29.411 --> 00:06:32.980
it's really the delivery system of the information or anything else.

129
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.210
<v 0>You're talking to a guy who put out two tweets expressed a simple political</v>

130
00:06:37.211 --> 00:06:39.850
opinion, no inflammatory language.

131
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.370
<v 2>Can you just remind me what the tweets were exactly because it's kind of,</v>

132
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.820
you're a former CA ops guy. I think you've proven here these,

133
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.400
this half hour or whatever it is that, you know, what you're talking about.

134
00:06:48.401 --> 00:06:50.260
And here are the two tweets that you've put up.

135
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.560
<v 0>So both of them basically had to do with, uh,</v>

136
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.870
president Trump or Democrats being crazy.

137
00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.440
And one was taking a headline from the Washington post,

138
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.700
which was silly Parson flim-flam did, but I'm not what the hell the,

139
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.940
the headline was.

140
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.230
I was just commenting on the fact that it was silly and that was enough to get

141
00:07:08.231 --> 00:07:10.690
me banned for whatever number of days. Right. Um,

142
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:15.730
the other was a thread talking, uh, about, uh, the president, uh, and you know,

143
00:07:15.731 --> 00:07:20.500
what we are are this whole impeachment silliness and how absurd it isn't it,

144
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.220
it was a relatively short thread and it was bad. Um, again,

145
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:29.230
simply taking a snippet from the IgE report and commenting on that

146
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.790
sexual report. That was enough. So that to me, and I know that you,

147
00:07:33.791 --> 00:07:37.870
you have been banging this drum for a long time is incredibly frightening that

148
00:07:37.871 --> 00:07:39.970
we now have a handful of,

149
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:44.350
of entities from Silicon Valley that are really publishers deciding who gets to

150
00:07:44.351 --> 00:07:47.410
say whatever they want them to say.

151
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:49.630
And if it goes too far,

152
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:54.880
either as a corporate policy or as a one off or whatever number

153
00:07:54.881 --> 00:07:58.120
of employees decide, that's bad, they're gonna throw a little sand in the gears,

154
00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:01.030
right. They may not ban you completely, they may,

155
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.700
but they may just throw some sand in the gears and have you blocked for a week

156
00:08:03.701 --> 00:08:06.910
or two or whatever. When, when you want to share something,

157
00:08:06.911 --> 00:08:11.560
a very important time of nation's politics right there during this Iran issue,

158
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.210
right? So we're to throw some sand in your gears,

159
00:08:13.211 --> 00:08:15.850
we're going to stop you from tweeting or stop you from sharing something on

160
00:08:15.851 --> 00:08:18.040
Facebook. That's what they're doing now. That's what they've done.

161
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:22.990
<v 2>Does it feel like the whole game is designed to just make us crazier</v>

162
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:28.480
right now? Like every time, like once you start seeing this stuff, right?

163
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.450
You have your little red, the moment you start seeing this stuff,

164
00:08:31.451 --> 00:08:34.390
you don't want to see it, right. You want to put, uh,

165
00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:37.600
the ocean back in the cup and it just doesn't fit.

166
00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:42.040
<v 0>Well, I think that this has been a long time coming. So what's interesting is,</v>

167
00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:46.510
uh, uh, MIT did this brilliant study, um, that, uh, in the late nineties,

168
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:50.800
when some of our economic trade policies were changing China into the WTO, uh,

169
00:08:50.801 --> 00:08:53.290
we had Mexico and Canada NAFTA,

170
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.760
and a lot of the communities that were being negatively, uh,

171
00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.330
by these economic changes were starting to elect people to,

172
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:02.820
to Congress and Senate, uh,

173
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.370
who were increasingly more inflammatory,

174
00:09:05.371 --> 00:09:08.280
increasingly further on the left and further on the right and,

175
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:12.430
and what you now see that, that created a marketplace for people immediate to,

176
00:09:12.431 --> 00:09:16.410
to be even more loud and bombastic and crazy because people were angry.

177
00:09:16.411 --> 00:09:19.530
And so they were able to tap into that marketplace. Right? So I think that,

178
00:09:19.531 --> 00:09:22.800
that the things that you're seeing in America's media right now are really

179
00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:25.440
reflective of a country that's deeply unsettled.

180
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:28.260
It doesn't mean that we don't celebrate the progress here in this country,

181
00:09:28.261 --> 00:09:30.450
because economically I think you could make an argument.

182
00:09:30.451 --> 00:09:32.970
And you've had people in this program that made it very clear that we are

183
00:09:32.971 --> 00:09:37.380
benefiting profoundly from our wonderful economic system and perfect as it is

184
00:09:37.381 --> 00:09:39.540
our wonderful Republic and perfect as it is.

185
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.530
But there's clearly a sickness that is being reflected in our media.

186
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.890
That is really at the end of the day, it reflects our own brokenness,

187
00:09:46.891 --> 00:09:50.550
our own anger, because we're, so we're responding in such a visceral way.

188
00:09:50.551 --> 00:09:51.384
We're giving those people. Right.

189
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.920
<v 2>All right. So let's go to our, what was be beat up lefty guys here for a second,</v>

190
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.920
because as you're saying that I'm reminded of when I used to be on the young

191
00:09:57.921 --> 00:10:02.060
Turks and I was a big lefty that I'd be on air with the host and they'd be

192
00:10:02.061 --> 00:10:05.480
screaming like crazy people about something there's no,

193
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.820
there's no video of me ever screaming about anything like this,

194
00:10:07.821 --> 00:10:08.900
but they'd be screaming this thing,

195
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:11.120
and then we'd cut to break and then they'd be completely fine. Again,

196
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.910
like completely fine. Then we come back and people are screaming, crying,

197
00:10:13.911 --> 00:10:16.940
or yelling. We're pounding their fists. And I remember thinking like,

198
00:10:16.941 --> 00:10:18.950
this is just all theater.

199
00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:22.310

200
