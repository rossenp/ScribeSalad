00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.620
<v 1>Today as a leader, a follower, a reader, a writer, a speaker, a listener,</v>

2
00:00:09.621 --> 00:00:13.430
a student, a teacher Jocko, Willink, welcome to the Rubin report.

3
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.120
How was that? I took that right out of the bio. That's good,

4
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.720
right out of the Twitter by as much word or viral. Yeah. Yeah.

5
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.590
You're a little bit of everything.

6
00:00:21.591 --> 00:00:23.630
That actually is a pretty good explanation of you.

7
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.630
<v 2>It actually, it actually is a pretty good explanation to me.</v>

8
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.070
I think I cover those multiple dichotomies fairly well.

9
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.780
<v 1>Yeah. That would probably explain why you've written roughly 37,000 books.</v>

10
00:00:35.781 --> 00:00:37.100
Right? How many, how many books have you written? I mean,

11
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.130
I normally only put one book on the table. We put four here.

12
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.330
<v 2>So I've written so far. I've written three adult books and three kids books.</v>

13
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.140
I've got another kid's book coming out in the spring and I've got another adult

14
00:00:48.141 --> 00:00:48.980
book coming out,

15
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.620
going head to head with Jordan Peterson in January of 2020.

16
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.640
<v 1>Oh, Oh yeah. I probably will be on tour with him for that book.</v>

17
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.330
That means that we're going to be in competition. Okay. We'll bring it. Oh,

18
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.530
all right. We'll see. We'll see.

19
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.180
<v 2>It's nice to, uh, to not actually have to compete with, with the officers. Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.570
<v 1>Yeah. Do you feel like you're in competition with anyone? That's,</v>

21
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.990
that's an interesting place to start off.

22
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.390
<v 2>Well, that's, I guess there's a dichotomy there too,</v>

23
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.310
because I don't feel like I'm in competition with anyone.

24
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.530
And I feel like I'm in competition with everyone.

25
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.640
That's just sort of in my nature to just compete.

26
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.780
But no, I mean, in this world that I'm in right now,

27
00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:28.340
I don't really feel like I'm competing with anyone.

28
00:01:28.341 --> 00:01:32.420
I feel like I'm just kind of doing what I do talking about what I like to talk

29
00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:32.721
about,

30
00:01:32.721 --> 00:01:37.190
writing about what I like to write about and hanging out with cool people most

31
00:01:37.191 --> 00:01:38.024
of the time. Yeah.

32
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.710
<v 1>Pretty good. Pretty good. All right. Well,</v>

33
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.370
I think 99% of my audience knows who you are and knows a lot about you,

34
00:01:43.371 --> 00:01:45.110
but for the people that don't. And by the way,

35
00:01:45.111 --> 00:01:46.640
I should say right before we started, I was saying,

36
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.260
we have been trying to coordinate this for about 27 years, right?

37
00:01:51.261 --> 00:01:54.140
I mean a long time, which is kind of funny. I mean, it really says it's like,

38
00:01:54.141 --> 00:01:55.340
well, we're two people that are,

39
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.190
that are busy and it was hard to hard to really make this happen.

40
00:01:58.191 --> 00:02:00.020
But for the people that know nothing about you,

41
00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:01.430
tell me a little bit about your history.

42
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.120
<v 2>I was born and raised in a small new England town.</v>

43
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.330
I was a rebellious kid, my

44
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.550
best way to rebel as a kid coming from a small new England town was to join the

45
00:02:13.551 --> 00:02:16.370
military. So I joined the military after high school.

46
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.470
I spent 20 years in the military and when I retired from the military,

47
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.060
I started taking the things that I learned from the military and

48
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.650
teaching them to civilian companies and civilian leaders.

49
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.850
And eventually that turned into a book and a podcast and all this other stuff.

50
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.480
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

51
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.180
So tell me a little bit more about what you were like that made you want to go

52
00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:42.830
into the military. What was that rebellious kid or whatever that, yeah.

53
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.800
<v 2>I just grew up in a,</v>

54
00:02:44.801 --> 00:02:49.640
in a little new England town and there was a lot of hippies and just

55
00:02:49.641 --> 00:02:53.540
kind of kids like that running around and smoking pot and whatever.

56
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.530
And I really wasn't into that. And so, you know,

57
00:02:57.531 --> 00:03:00.490
I think a lot of kids when they rebel as kids, because all kids rebel,

58
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.200
a lot of kids repelled by drinking,

59
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:04.300
or they do drugs or whatever they're going to do.

60
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.650
And I went in the other direction was like into hardcore music and

61
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.830
eventually said, Oh yeah,

62
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.030
I'm just going to join the military because that's what I'm going to do. Yeah.

63
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.030
It's funny.

64
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.820
<v 1>When you talk about it, it almost sounds like you're slightly dismissing it,</v>

65
00:03:20.821 --> 00:03:24.390
but you had a, you had a pretty good storied career as a Navy seal.

66
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.630
<v 2>Yeah, no, I grew up in the seal teams.</v>

67
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.380
I went right in the Navy right in the seal teams and that's where I spent my,

68
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.550
my whole adult life.

69
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.350
And it was an incredible experience to work with a bunch of awesome people

70
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.040
and got to do things that I had dreamed about doing since I was a little kid.

71
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.371
<v 1>Well,</v>

72
00:03:41.371 --> 00:03:45.030
what should we know about like the life of a Navy seal that you don't get in the

73
00:03:45.031 --> 00:03:48.870
movies or, or however else we just sort of imagine these lives to be.

74
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.550
<v 2>I would say the biggest thing to remember is that that people in the seal teams</v>

75
00:03:53.551 --> 00:03:55.530
and people in the military in general, they're people,

76
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.950
they're just normal people. They go home, they got wives, they got kids,

77
00:03:58.951 --> 00:04:00.330
they're trying to live a normal life.

78
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.200
And then their job requires them to do things that are aren't very normal.

79
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.300
And so they, you know, for me,

80
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.620
I kind of learned to compartmentalize what I was doing in the military and when

81
00:04:10.621 --> 00:04:12.030
I'd come home. And I always,

82
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.210
I tell this to police officers and firefighters and military guys today,

83
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.210
don't when you get home, don't bring your uniform home,

84
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.250
don't wear your uniform home. Like physically change your,

85
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.010
take your uniform off, leave it at work, put on your,

86
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.890
your civilian clothes and you go home and be a civilian.

87
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.180
<v 1>How hard is that though? Once you're sort of in that locked mindset,</v>

88
00:04:30.181 --> 00:04:33.300
which obviously has so much to do with the things that you write about and why

89
00:04:33.301 --> 00:04:35.840
your message actually is, is working and help.

90
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.740
<v 2>And people you say, how hard is it? L it can be hard. It can be harsh. Uh,</v>

91
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.510
you know, cause you've got one life that you're living where decisions are

92
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.190
really consequential.

93
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.500
And then you've got your regular life that you're living and things aren't

94
00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:55.380
that they aren't as consequential. You know,

95
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.820
I had a situation where I was at work and there was a lot of stuff going on at

96
00:04:59.821 --> 00:05:03.450
work. They were, they were redeploying people to Afghanistan.

97
00:05:03.451 --> 00:05:05.430
There was big decisions that were being made at work.

98
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.450
And I remember I came home from work one day and like I said,

99
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.760
tried to try to leave my work at work,

100
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.550
but I'm sitting there thinking about how all this stuff is going to unfold.

101
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.040
And my wife, you know, I got home and my wife goes, Oh, I can't believe this.

102
00:05:20.041 --> 00:05:24.840
And I was like, what happened is, is everything okay? And she says, you know,

103
00:05:24.841 --> 00:05:29.040
the, no, it's not okay. The Disney on ice is the same night,

104
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.810
that's for the kids. And I'm just thinking, Hey, if that's,

105
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.560
if that's the biggest worries my wife has, then that's a positive thing.

106
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.320
<v 1>Then life's pretty good. Yeah. Life's pretty good. Yeah.</v>

107
00:05:40.321 --> 00:05:44.250
So how quickly did you realize that you wanted to sort of bring these ideas

108
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.570
about personal responsibility and sort of owning your life and all that

109
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.580
into sort of that world, the world where Disney on ice matters?

110
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.430
<v 2>Yeah, it's I was about six months from retiring.</v>

111
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.030
I had a friend that was the CEO of a big company and he said,

112
00:06:02.031 --> 00:06:04.430
I want you to come and talk to my executives about combat leadership.

113
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.080
And I said, Hey, sure sounds, it sounds cool. So I went and did it.

114
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.470
And when I got, and I don't think he really knew what to expect, you know,

115
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:15.950
because I'm looked like a knuckle dragger and uh, at least a good portion.

116
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.840
I actually am a knuckle dragger. And so we bring me in to talk and I thought,

117
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.260
I think he was maybe thinking, I tell some cooler stories and that'd be,

118
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.410
that'd be great. But I actually started talking about how you lead.

119
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.570
And when I got done, he came up to me and said,

120
00:06:29.571 --> 00:06:33.560
I want you to do this for every division that I have in my company. And I said,

121
00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:37.430
well, you know, I'm retiring. And he said, well, I'll give you money.

122
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.860
And I said, okay.

123
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.110
So I started working with all the different divisionals and at one of those

124
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:49.310
division meetings, the CEO of the parent company was there. And when I got done,

125
00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:50.001
he came up to me and said,

126
00:06:50.001 --> 00:06:52.850
I want you to come and talk to all my CEOs for all these companies that I want.

127
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.450
And he owned like 45 or 50 companies. So I went and did that.

128
00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.060
And when I went and talked to those companies, of course,

129
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.620
then a bunch of those CEOs came up to me and said, Hey,

130
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:02.690
I want you to come and talk to my company. So that's kind of the,

131
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.550
the way that it started. And it didn't take me very long at all. I mean,

132
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.010
it actually was the very first company,

133
00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:08.930
that first guy that I talked to when they started,

134
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.630
when that group started telling me about the problems they were having,

135
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.480
I was sitting there thinking to myself, well,

136
00:07:13.481 --> 00:07:16.130
I saw these problems in seal platoons when I was training steel platoons.

137
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.930
It's the same thing. It's leadership. Yeah.

138
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.920
Were you surprised that the big successful businesses were having such a

139
00:07:21.921 --> 00:07:23.000
leadership crisis?

140
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.060
I was surprised for about five minutes and then I realized that these are all

141
00:07:26.061 --> 00:07:26.894
human beings.

142
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.920
These are the same human beings that are in a seal platoon in an army company

143
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.590
and in a business. And they're all,

144
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:38.240
they're all have the same idiosyncrasies that they have, the same egos,

145
00:07:38.241 --> 00:07:40.820
the same personalities. You can see it all.

146
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.930
And when you've seen it all over and over again, it becomes pretty evident,

147
00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:46.280
pretty clear when you're looking at it.

148
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:48.290
And the last job that I had in the seal teams, I was training.

149
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.870
I was running the seal training for the West coast seal teams.

150
00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:51.770
And this isn't a trading room.

151
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.010
Where do you see like the guys carrying the boats on their heads and carrying

152
00:07:54.011 --> 00:07:55.870
logs around and doing a bunch of pushups and stuff.

153
00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.190
The training that I ran was the training where seals actually learn to go into

154
00:08:00.191 --> 00:08:02.020
combat and fight the enemy.

155
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.830
And this is where we really start focusing on combat leadership.

156
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.350
And so in this training that I ran,

157
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:13.300
we got to take seal platoons and put them through really tough training

158
00:08:13.301 --> 00:08:16.600
scenarios, very realistic training scenarios over and over and over again.

159
00:08:16.601 --> 00:08:21.340
So every night I basically would be putting a new seal platoon through another

160
00:08:21.341 --> 00:08:22.174
training scenario,

161
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.480
which the next night it would be another seal platoon going through this same

162
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:26.350
training scenario.

163
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.480
And then the next night I'd be another seal between going through the same

164
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:29.000
training center.

165
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.140
So you take these different seal pretends and what's different about a seal

166
00:08:32.141 --> 00:08:33.340
platoon. What's different about a seal.

167
00:08:33.341 --> 00:08:37.720
Platoon is really just boils down to the leadership because we've got 16 seals

168
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.270
in the ceiling. The guys are basically the same show. There's some,

169
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.910
there's a bell curve. There's some top end performers.

170
00:08:42.911 --> 00:08:44.980
There's some low end performers is a bunch of guys in the middle.

171
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.940
So the real variation on their performance was based almost a hundred percent on

172
00:08:48.941 --> 00:08:50.680
their, on their leadership. In fact,

173
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:52.510
it was a hundred percent on their leadership.

174
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:57.570
And so I got to see this and I to watch these leadership scenarios unfold over

175
00:08:57.571 --> 00:09:00.630
and over again and see what leadership things worked and what didn't work. And,

176
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.920
and so by the time I, I left that job and entered the civilian sector,

177
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.360
I'd watch some random team of leaders inside of an organization.

178
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.850
And I'd say to myself, well, there's strategic messages.

179
00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:14.400
And getting down to the frontline troops, they need to communicate this better.

180
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.710
Or, Oh, their departments aren't working together.

181
00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:20.280
They need to cover move forward together. Or their mission is way too complex.

182
00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:22.440
And that no one has any idea what they're actually supposed to be doing.

183
00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:26.940
So they need to simplify this or that this senior leader is making all the

184
00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:29.760
decisions and therefore everything's moving really slow and nothing's happening

185
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.760
at a good rate of speed. So they need to use decentralized manner.

186
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.860
And it was just so obvious when I start.

187
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:39.080
<v 1>How much of leadership in general do you think is innate versus learned?</v>

188
00:09:39.081 --> 00:09:41.270
Obviously you're teaching people to learn part,

189
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.520
but there has to be some element that's an aid right.

190
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.020
<v 2>There absolutely is. And there's the,</v>

191
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.460
the analogy that I give and I don't play video games, but I've seen it.

192
00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.260
But on video games, there's,

193
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:56.870
you have a character in a video game and you'll have a certain level of

194
00:09:56.871 --> 00:09:59.900
intelligence and a certain level of strength and a certain level of agility.

195
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.840
And those levels are what you get.

196
00:10:02.841 --> 00:10:05.090
And then you work with them while at the same thing for a leader.

197
00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.050
And there's different.

198
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:09.860
There's different characteristics that you get that are good for leadership,

199
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.140
right? If you're someone that's really articulate,

200
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:15.740
that's a great thing to have to be a good leader because you want the human

201
00:10:15.741 --> 00:10:18.770
beings that you're talking to to understand what you're actually saying. So,

202
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.220
and different people are naturally more articulate than other people.

203
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:27.980
It's good to be able to look at complex problems and be able to simplify them,

204
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:28.760
right? That's a,

205
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:33.560
that's a very powerful tool to have a really complex thing to solve and be able

206
00:10:33.561 --> 00:10:36.800
to look at it and say, okay, simplify it. And then simplify it.

207
00:10:36.801 --> 00:10:38.390
Not only for yourself, so you can decide what to do,

208
00:10:38.391 --> 00:10:41.420
but simplify it for your team. So they understand what to do. That's,

209
00:10:41.421 --> 00:10:44.510
that's a characteristic that some people have. The,

210
00:10:44.511 --> 00:10:49.130
the one that I bring up a lot, because it's very obvious is, is being loud.

211
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.310
Because if you're in a leadership position,

212
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.620
you need to be able to make people hear you.

213
00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.110
And some people are born with a very loud voice.

214
00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:02.000
I was luckily born with a very loud voice and it's inherited from my genes,

215
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:05.420
right? And my kids inherited there. My kids are all can be very loud,

216
00:11:05.421 --> 00:11:07.550
which is sometimes problematic in a house.

217
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:12.230
But if you can't bark a command so that people can hear you in a machine gun

218
00:11:12.231 --> 00:11:14.180
fight, no, one's me able to do what you asked them to do.

219
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:19.190
So there's these different characteristics and you can improve upon them.

220
00:11:19.191 --> 00:11:21.020
So if you're not very articulate,

221
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.890
you can read and you can write and you can speak and you become more articulate.

222
00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.100
If you are not very good at simplifying problems,

223
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:32.600
you can start looking at complex problems and thinking about how you can

224
00:11:32.601 --> 00:11:34.550
simplify them and you can get better at that.

225
00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:40.130
The being loud part is there's definitely a genetic aspect of that. So sure.

226
00:11:40.131 --> 00:11:43.970
You can learn to project your voice more, but some people aren't very loud.

227
00:11:43.971 --> 00:11:46.430
They're just born that way. And so what does a person do in that situation?

228
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.580
Well, what a person does in that situation is when they have to give an order,

229
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.060
they tell one of the loud mouths in their platoon to tell everyone to get over

230
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.860
this other building now, and that loud mouth will pass the word.

231
00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:01.030
And so what you do as a leader is you find members for your team that can

232
00:12:01.031 --> 00:12:02.140
compliment your weaknesses.

233
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:05.590
So there are parts that you can improve and there are parts that you can

234
00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:09.010
improve. And if you,

235
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:14.650
the only real impediment to improving is someone that doesn't

236
00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:16.510
have the humility to say, you know what?

237
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.120
I think I could work on being more articulate or,

238
00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:22.510
you know what I think I could work on solving problems and making them more

239
00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:26.140
simple, or, you know what, I'm not that loud. And instead of saying,

240
00:12:26.141 --> 00:12:28.870
you know what, that's not a good way to lead. Instead. I say, you know what?

241
00:12:28.871 --> 00:12:31.360
I'm not that loud, but Billy over here is loud.

242
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:34.210
So I'm going to let him put the word out when it needs to get put out.

243
00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.310
But if you're, if you don't have that humility to do that,

244
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:37.360
you won't improve as a leader.

245
00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:41.760
<v 1>Have you found those people that even if you lay out what the right, you know,</v>

246
00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:44.790
skills are that they have to work on or where their blind spots are, et cetera,

247
00:12:44.791 --> 00:12:46.380
et cetera, that they just can't,

248
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:48.660
whether it's ego or whatever else that they just can't,

249
00:12:48.661 --> 00:12:50.130
that you just certain people you just can't get.

250
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.690
<v 2>Absolutely. It's a, it's a horrible situation to be in. And in the seal teams,</v>

251
00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.770
those guys will get fired in the civilian sector. Generally,

252
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.380
those guys get fired because I mean, you, you,

253
00:13:02.381 --> 00:13:06.870
you go into a company and you've got a CEO that is not listening to anyone up or

254
00:13:06.871 --> 00:13:08.250
down the chain of the, not listening to the board,

255
00:13:08.251 --> 00:13:10.890
not listening to the subordinates. How is he going to improve?

256
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.710
He's not going to, and by the way, why does he need to improve?

257
00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:16.590
He needs to improve because his company isn't doing well. So,

258
00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.620
but this person might think, Hey, you know, I'm great. I don't,

259
00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.150
I'm not gonna learn anything from anybody.

260
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.800
I'm just going to keep doing it my way.

261
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.600
And that guy's not going to stay in that job because they don't have the

262
00:13:27.601 --> 00:13:30.390
humility to say, you know what, I'm probably doing some things wrong.

263
00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.190
That's why we're not making money.

264
00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.660
And so I need to change some of the things that I'm doing so that we can make

265
00:13:36.661 --> 00:13:40.200
money. But if you don't have that attitude and you're not humble, yeah.

266
00:13:40.201 --> 00:13:41.070
You'll end up getting fired.

267
00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:41.821
<v 1>So, conversely,</v>

268
00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:45.720
have you seen people that basically had none of the skills that have been able

269
00:13:45.721 --> 00:13:49.290
to overcome it just through perseverance that just innately don't have the

270
00:13:49.291 --> 00:13:52.290
leadership traits that don't have, you know, they don't speak loud.

271
00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:53.880
They aren't clear, they can't make decisions,

272
00:13:53.881 --> 00:13:55.890
but just out of sheer sort of force of will.

273
00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:59.430
<v 2>There's, there's all these little aspects that you have,</v>

274
00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.920
you can improve upon right now. Uh, you're not going to take,

275
00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.600
I'm not going to lie to you and say,

276
00:14:03.601 --> 00:14:07.830
you can take somebody that has no aptitude for leadership,

277
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.710
and they're going to turn into a great leader that that's probably not going to

278
00:14:10.711 --> 00:14:15.060
happen, but you can take someone that has minimal aptitude for leadership,

279
00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.210
and they can improve the areas where they need to improve.

280
00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:22.410
They can compliment themselves with a team that can cover for the areas where

281
00:14:22.411 --> 00:14:24.990
they're weak and they can end up doing a great job in a leadership position.

282
00:14:24.991 --> 00:14:26.040
For sure. Yeah.

283
00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:29.490
<v 1>So handing some of this stuff off, people don't think of that in certain ways,</v>

284
00:14:29.491 --> 00:14:30.330
when it comes to leaders,

285
00:14:30.331 --> 00:14:32.580
like they have to do everything or know everything or something,

286
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.400
but actually hand in some of this stuff off is, is good.

287
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.050
Delegating actually is good.

288
00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.050
<v 2>Yeah, absolutely. Like for instance, big shocker.</v>

289
00:14:40.051 --> 00:14:43.110
I don't really like doing paperwork a lot. You know what I mean? Really,

290
00:14:43.111 --> 00:14:45.990
it's kind of, I know it might seem odd,

291
00:14:45.991 --> 00:14:47.940
but I always had guys that worked for me,

292
00:14:47.941 --> 00:14:50.820
I'd figure out that guy that was really good at administrative stuff.

293
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:52.160
And there you go, guess what?

294
00:14:52.161 --> 00:14:54.620
He's going to do a bunch of administrative stuff and that's great.

295
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.250
And so whatever areas of weakness you have have some, you know,

296
00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.470
get a member of your team, recruit someone,

297
00:15:00.471 --> 00:15:03.590
bring someone on board that can actually make these things happen and it'll work

298
00:15:03.591 --> 00:15:04.210
out. Great.

299
00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:04.510
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

300
00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:09.400
Are you kind of surprised how much we need a leadership sort of in

301
00:15:09.401 --> 00:15:13.390
society right now that we seem to have like a complete dearth of leadership?

302
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:13.901
I mean,

303
00:15:13.901 --> 00:15:17.230
you mentioned Jordan Peterson before when I see the message that he's bringing

304
00:15:17.231 --> 00:15:20.410
to these people, it's really about getting yourself together, which is the most,

305
00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.720
I mean, it's very consistent with your message, but,

306
00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:26.080
but the people that are coming are sort of looking for a leader to say that,

307
00:15:26.081 --> 00:15:29.320
that we just don't have, we seemingly don't have good leaders right now.

308
00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.630
Do you think that's a fair estimate?

309
00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.420
<v 2>Well, we do have good leaders.</v>

310
00:15:34.421 --> 00:15:37.420
There's plenty of good leaders out there and I see them all the time in the

311
00:15:37.421 --> 00:15:38.140
business world.

312
00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.510
I still work with the military and there's great leaders inside the military.

313
00:15:40.511 --> 00:15:42.370
There's great leaders inside the business world, for sure.

314
00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:46.600
There's also always a lack of leadership. And I mean, I, you know,

315
00:15:46.601 --> 00:15:47.920
on my podcast, I cover,

316
00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:51.760
I cover books about war generally first-person accounts,

317
00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.640
and there's a lack of leadership back then and there's good leaders.

318
00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:57.610
So I don't know if it's gotten any better or worse,

319
00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:02.260
but the fact of the matter is that leadership is,

320
00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.860
is the hardest thing in the world. As far as I know, it's,

321
00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:08.170
it's the hardest thing. You know, people used to ask me what I,

322
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:11.380
when I first got out of the military, what was the most complex, you know,

323
00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:14.230
operation that you would plan on with planning operations?

324
00:16:14.231 --> 00:16:18.520
Isn't that big of a deal? Like here's a bad guy. Here's the assets that we have.

325
00:16:18.521 --> 00:16:19.930
Here's what we're going to do to go take them out. I mean,

326
00:16:19.931 --> 00:16:24.310
this is stuff that generally it's, it's not that hard to do,

327
00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.140
but the hard part is, is leading human beings.

328
00:16:26.141 --> 00:16:29.890
And so why does it seem like there's that we need better leadership because you

329
00:16:29.891 --> 00:16:31.180
always need better leadership.

330
00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:34.570
And because leadership is so hard to actually do properly. Yeah.

331
00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:38.170
<v 1>Do you think we need some sort of mandatory military service to get some of this</v>

332
00:16:38.171 --> 00:16:39.820
through to young people?

333
00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:44.470
<v 2>I think military service is great for people. I know it was,</v>

334
00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:47.980
it was great for me and it, it worked out really well for me,

335
00:16:47.981 --> 00:16:49.490
but I really don't believe in,

336
00:16:49.491 --> 00:16:54.160
in mandatory service because I really don't believe that it's good

337
00:16:54.161 --> 00:16:58.410
for government to tell people what you need to do. Yeah.

338
00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:59.950
I don't really support that,

339
00:16:59.951 --> 00:17:04.600
but I definitely support and encourage everyone to go in the reserves, you know,

340
00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:08.020
go join that, join the army or the Marine Corps, the Navy air force reserves,

341
00:17:08.021 --> 00:17:12.430
where you go away for six weeks or eight weeks and you kind of learn what the

342
00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:13.091
military is about.

343
00:17:13.091 --> 00:17:17.110
And then you do one weekend a month and two weeks in the summertime for,

344
00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.153
you know, indefinitely.

345
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.680
<v 1>So I think I have a pretty good handle on your politics. But do,</v>

346
00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:24.880
do you even have a label that kind of works for you politically?

347
00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:29.260
<v 2>Uh, I don't know. You, you, I don't know. I don't know what to label.</v>

348
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.090
I don't know. I think it'd be pretty hard to label it.

349
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:35.830
<v 1>Sort of summing up sort of your political beliefs. What would you say?</v>

350
00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:41.230
<v 2>I think that, I guess a broad statement would be,</v>

351
00:17:41.231 --> 00:17:46.000
I don't think that the government is the solution to our problems, but yeah,

352
00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:50.280
I think that generally unleashing individuals to try and make things happen is

353
00:17:50.281 --> 00:17:51.810
the best way for things to work. It's,

354
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.630
it's consistent with decentralized command that to talk,

355
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:58.350
talk about in the first book that I wrote with my, my brother life is

356
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.980
you can't control everything. You know,

357
00:18:01.981 --> 00:18:06.480
centralized decision-making does not work. It doesn't work on the battlefield.

358
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:11.340
It doesn't work in business. It doesn't work with governments. So that's,

359
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.600
you know, broadly speaking guy,

360
00:18:12.601 --> 00:18:16.260
I don't think that the government should control what individuals are doing as,

361
00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:19.200
as little as possible. Do there have to be some rules and regulations in place?

362
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:22.380
Absolutely. But the framework should be as loose as possible.

363
00:18:22.381 --> 00:18:26.940
Just like if I'm running a seal platoon, it's not every man for himself. It's,

364
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:28.950
here's our standard operating procedures.

365
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.580
Here's the areas where we commit to disciplined process.

366
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:35.730
But then once you understand those and you know,

367
00:18:35.731 --> 00:18:39.990
those you're allowed to operate freely within those guidelines to execute the

368
00:18:39.991 --> 00:18:44.160
mission. And that's what works. That's what makes, not just the seal teams.

369
00:18:44.161 --> 00:18:45.660
That's what makes any good military unit good.

370
00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.870
And that's what makes good businesses good, good businesses.

371
00:18:48.871 --> 00:18:51.300
Aren't good because someone is micromanaging. Every single decision,

372
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:55.050
good businesses are good because people broadly understand the direction they're

373
00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:55.710
heading.

374
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:59.190
They understand that and they're allowed to move forward as they see fit.

375
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.160
<v 1>You shocked when you say something like that,</v>

376
00:19:01.161 --> 00:19:03.050
which obviously I agree with a hundred percent. I mean,

377
00:19:03.051 --> 00:19:07.310
all I talk about here is personal responsibility over and over that that doesn't

378
00:19:07.311 --> 00:19:11.450
seem to sort of be the kind of flavor of the day at the moment that this,

379
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:14.270
if you listen to mainstream media, it's sort of more, well,

380
00:19:14.271 --> 00:19:17.840
the government should give you this and we should take from some give to others.

381
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.800
That there's a more feeling of you,

382
00:19:20.801 --> 00:19:25.040
you were owed something rather than you got to get something you're asking if

383
00:19:25.041 --> 00:19:29.780
I'm surprised by that. Yeah. Because then, because the way you're laying it out,

384
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:32.930
it's obvious. You know what I mean? Like, I mean that in the best sense,

385
00:19:32.931 --> 00:19:34.970
it's obvious, like, yeah, it's your life go,

386
00:19:34.971 --> 00:19:37.130
go do something that has value and create.

387
00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:39.890
<v 2>I guess the real easy answer is no, I'm not surprised by it at all.</v>

388
00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:44.420
Because if I come here and offer you something for free,

389
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:48.050
why would you not want it? Why would you not want to take it? If I say, Hey,

390
00:19:48.051 --> 00:19:51.620
you can have this house for free. And you'd say, okay,

391
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:55.130
that seems like a good deal to me. Right. And so, yeah, sure.

392
00:19:55.131 --> 00:20:00.110
I understand why people think that sounds like a good idea because it's

393
00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:03.620
something for free and they want to do in their own individual world,

394
00:20:03.621 --> 00:20:04.101
they think, okay,

395
00:20:04.101 --> 00:20:06.530
I do want to take advantage of this and get something for free.

396
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.060
So it doesn't surprise me at all.

397
00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:12.200
That what is unfortunate is if you can't draw the line between, Hey,

398
00:20:12.201 --> 00:20:15.500
everyone gets everything for free and there's a price to that,

399
00:20:15.501 --> 00:20:17.630
that somebody is gonna have to pay. That's where it becomes.

400
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:21.140
<v 1>There is some costs in, in there somewhere, somewhere. Yeah.</v>

401
00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.360
So tell me what it was like when you started writing.

402
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:26.240
Cause that must've been a whole other ball of wax.

403
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:29.360
<v 2>You know, it was, I was actually an English major in college and I, I went,</v>

404
00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.160
I went to college halfway through my Navy career.

405
00:20:31.161 --> 00:20:32.420
I started off as an enlisted guy, went,

406
00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:35.300
went to college and then I became an officer and then went to college

407
00:20:35.301 --> 00:20:36.134
eventually. So,

408
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:40.490
and the reason I was an English major was because believe it or not,

409
00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:44.000
when you're an officer in the military and actually almost any job in the

410
00:20:44.001 --> 00:20:48.250
military, you have to write, why not have to write? You have to read,

411
00:20:48.251 --> 00:20:52.720
you have to understand because you have to write concept of operations documents

412
00:20:52.721 --> 00:20:54.580
that are going to be pushed up the chain of command.

413
00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:58.480
And they're going to read through them and ask questions and,

414
00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:02.950
and look at the document and try and comprehend what it is that you're trying to

415
00:21:02.951 --> 00:21:05.710
do. You got to write evaluations for your troops and your,

416
00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:08.950
your troops are getting promoted based on the evaluations that you write.

417
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:10.600
Same with awards. You got to write awards,

418
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:14.980
same thing with after actions reports. So if you do an operation and things,

419
00:21:14.981 --> 00:21:15.701
don't go, well,

420
00:21:15.701 --> 00:21:19.480
you have to be able to articulate and explain that what happened and then pass

421
00:21:19.481 --> 00:21:22.270
that word on. So everyone understands not only that you're being,

422
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.960
you're being given direction, verbal direction. Yes, of course.

423
00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.250
But you're given written direction as well.

424
00:21:27.251 --> 00:21:32.080
You're given missions in a written format or you're given rules of engagement in

425
00:21:32.081 --> 00:21:33.940
a written format written by lawyers.

426
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:39.130
And I realized while I was a young enlisted guy and then as a junior officer,

427
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:44.500
what I really need to be able to do is understand and communicate

428
00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:48.760
well up and down the chain of command. So when I went to college, I said, yeah,

429
00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:52.900
I want to learn English. I want to get good at it. And so that's what I did.

430
00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.210
And so obviously I did a bunch of writing and a ton of reading when I was in,

431
00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.820
when I was an English major in college.

432
00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:01.870
And then when I was in the military is writing, you're writing all the time.

433
00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:05.590
And then when, when, when I got out,

434
00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.740
when I was working with these companies and, and it grew really quickly,

435
00:22:08.741 --> 00:22:10.600
and that's why my, my buddy,

436
00:22:10.601 --> 00:22:12.970
who was one of the platoon commanders that worked for me in the battle of

437
00:22:12.971 --> 00:22:17.890
Ramadi, Leif, Babin, he, he was getting out of the Navy too. And,

438
00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.350
you know, as we started, I started to need some cover. And I said, Hey, man,

439
00:22:20.351 --> 00:22:23.260
you wanna want to jump in and get some of this? And he was all on board.

440
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:26.050
And then as we started doing this, people would always say, Hey,

441
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:27.530
do you have this stuff written down anywhere?

442
00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:30.010
Do you have a document you can give us? And so we eventually wrote it down.

443
00:22:30.011 --> 00:22:32.080
And then that's how the, that's how the first book came. Yeah.

444
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:35.070
<v 1>Can you lay out a little bit about the battle of Ramadi? You basically,</v>

445
00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.600
you sort of wrote the plans.

446
00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:41.340
<v 2>The person that led the battle of Ramadi that I was in was a guy named, uh,</v>

447
00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.270
Sean McFarland, who was a Colonel at the time, he retired as a general,

448
00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:47.040
just a super smart,

449
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.260
incredibly competent and great leader. He's a great leader.

450
00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.890
And he came in with, so I had 40 seals with me, right?

451
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:58.380
I had 40 sales with me and 60 support people.

452
00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:03.780
Colonel McFarland had 5,600 man armored brigade that we

453
00:23:03.781 --> 00:23:06.960
supported and we helped them. We worked together in the battle of Ramadi,

454
00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:09.270
vicious, fighting, very tough battle,

455
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:14.250
and really took a city that was completely controlled by the insurgence in

456
00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:19.350
2005, 2006. And by early 2007,

457
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:23.490
it was almost completely pacified. So it was, it was incredible.

458
00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:24.600
It was incredible,

459
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:29.490
incredible turnaround and an incredible Testament to the

460
00:23:29.491 --> 00:23:33.330
capability of the us armed forces.

461
00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:38.130
<v 1>Do you guys pay any attention to what's going on politically back home when</v>

462
00:23:38.131 --> 00:23:39.720
you're halfway across the world?

463
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:42.570
<v 2>Yes, absolutely.</v>

464
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:46.670
You have to pay attention to what's going on politically back home if it,

465
00:23:46.671 --> 00:23:50.540
especially like at this time when we deployed to Ramadi, so it's 2005, 2006,

466
00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:55.820
this is smack dab in the middle of the rising

467
00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.790
negative public opinion about the war in Iraq.

468
00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:03.110
It's also where we had our own government officials here in America that were

469
00:24:03.111 --> 00:24:07.040
saying, this is unwinnable. This is another Vietnam. This is a quagmire.

470
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:10.540
We shouldn't be there to bring everyone home. So yeah, you,

471
00:24:10.541 --> 00:24:14.810
you absolutely hear those things and that's not good. That's not,

472
00:24:14.811 --> 00:24:15.830
it's not a positive thing.

473
00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:19.550
It's not a positive thing to have your own government officials in America

474
00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:23.450
saying that you cannot win. And meanwhile, you're going out on an operation.

475
00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:24.160
Does that.

476
00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.690
<v 1>Drive you guys crazy more than anything else?</v>

477
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:29.140
Sort of the political elite that often have no idea what's happening on the

478
00:24:29.141 --> 00:24:31.540
ground that are just spouting off stuff.

479
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:36.520
<v 2>For sure. For sure. Yeah. But as I said, it's you listened to it,</v>

480
00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:38.800
but you can only pay so much attention to it.

481
00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:42.640
There's so much other things to focus on. I mean,

482
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:45.700
you think about it a little bit,

483
00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:49.870
but you're not caught up in the 24 hour news cycle. Like, you know,

484
00:24:49.871 --> 00:24:54.700
like people can tend to do here in America because you're working and

485
00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.490
you're getting back from one operation. You're preparing for another operation.

486
00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:00.430
I've got guys in the field, I got another element in the field.

487
00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.430
I'm going in the field. It's you don't have time to be sitting around, Hey,

488
00:25:03.431 --> 00:25:06.520
I wonder what this politician is saying about what we're doing.

489
00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.010
<v 1>Of leadership that you brought to.</v>

490
00:25:09.011 --> 00:25:11.830
It was just about managing stress for your guys.

491
00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:15.490
Just making sure that they were actually okay in the midst of the chaos.

492
00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:20.110
<v 2>Y absolutely. You have to do some of that. I mean, it's, it's a,</v>

493
00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:22.540
it's a balancing act between all kinds.

494
00:25:22.541 --> 00:25:25.540
There's all kinds of things that you're trying to juggle at the same time and

495
00:25:25.541 --> 00:25:27.430
managing stress on the guys is definitely one of them.

496
00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:31.360
And in a situation where you're getting guys wounded and your guys are getting

497
00:25:31.361 --> 00:25:35.170
killed, that stress meter can get pegged out pretty quick.

498
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:39.460
So you have to manage it. You have to do it to the best of your ability. That's,

499
00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:42.610
it's, it's hard. It's hard to because

500
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:47.980
the war is going to keep going and you are going to keep you,

501
00:25:47.981 --> 00:25:49.840
you have work that needs to continue.

502
00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:53.290
So the stress is going to build up on,

503
00:25:53.291 --> 00:25:56.290
on the troops and it's different for every guy, you know, the,

504
00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:00.410
the frontline seal or soldier or Marine they're,

505
00:26:00.411 --> 00:26:01.750
they're worried about getting blown up.

506
00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.160
They're worried about getting shot and killed.

507
00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:04.930
They're worried about their friends getting shot and killed.

508
00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:07.600
They're worried about their friends getting blown up when you're in charge of a

509
00:26:07.601 --> 00:26:08.434
bunch of guys, you're,

510
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:10.810
you're worried about all those guys and that happening to them.

511
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:15.520
You're worried about if we make a mistake, if we do something wrong,

512
00:26:15.521 --> 00:26:18.280
if we cause some massive collateral damage that has a negative,

513
00:26:18.281 --> 00:26:22.660
strategic impact, like that's, you have all of those stresses and you know,

514
00:26:22.661 --> 00:26:24.340
to control stress, what do you do? That's like,

515
00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:27.430
you look at the things you can't control, the things you can't control,

516
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.360
the you focus on the things you can control and the things that you can't

517
00:26:31.361 --> 00:26:34.450
control, you do your best to mitigate, and then you don't worry about them.

518
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:35.703
Cause they'll drive you crazy.

519
00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:38.950
<v 1>W what do you make of sort of where we're at now,</v>

520
00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:43.240
having lived through the Iraq war? Like, was it the right thing to do?

521
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:45.060
Should we have done things differently?

522
00:26:45.061 --> 00:26:48.810
Should we have not just announced we were leaving one day, the whole,

523
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:49.823
the whole thing.

524
00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:54.890
<v 2>The whole thing is that hindsight is 2020 and any normal human being</v>

525
00:26:54.891 --> 00:26:59.810
can look back at the American history as a whole and find out all

526
00:26:59.811 --> 00:27:04.040
the mistakes that we've made, which are, you know, infinite, right.

527
00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:05.810
We make an infinite number of mistakes,

528
00:27:05.811 --> 00:27:09.560
and we do the best to try and repair those once they've taken place. The,

529
00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:14.090
so for me to look at it from that angle, it's like, okay, yeah,

530
00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.010
there's all kinds of mistakes we make as a country.

531
00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:18.020
And we have make as a country and we will make as a country,

532
00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:22.610
but the best way for me to kind of rationalize or not even rationalize,

533
00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:25.760
because I don't think it needs rationalizations. But I,

534
00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:28.700
when I look at it from a granular level, which is,

535
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:34.130
which is very straightforward, we went into a city,

536
00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:39.500
the city of Ramadi that was being controlled by

537
00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:45.110
sick insurgents,

538
00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:49.280
the most sadistic evil sub-human

539
00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:54.680
people that you can imagine. They were raping, torturing,

540
00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:59.060
skinning people, alive, murdering whole families, beheading people.

541
00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.670
And when we went in there, and again,

542
00:28:01.671 --> 00:28:04.220
I'm not talking about we as this small group of seals,

543
00:28:04.221 --> 00:28:09.220
I'm talking about when this massive force of us coalition and

544
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:14.210
Iraqi forces went into that city and liberated those people

545
00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:18.890
from the torturous and sadistic

546
00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.290
control of those insurgents,

547
00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.560
the people of Vermont were overjoyed.

548
00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:27.860
And they would cheer when we killed insurgents.

549
00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.740
And they would tell us where insurgents were,

550
00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:33.980
and it was a beautiful transition to watch.

551
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:35.990
And it didn't really take place until after we left.

552
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:40.700
But after we left and we saw this, it was peaceful. It was literally peaceful.

553
00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:42.770
It went from a complete war zone to a,

554
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:46.400
to a peaceful city and where they were,

555
00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:49.520
they had markets open the street again, they had kids going to school,

556
00:28:49.521 --> 00:28:52.390
they had girls schools. Now, you know, there,

557
00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.580
there wasn't in the city of Ramadi, there was schools for girls.

558
00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:59.300
And this was just unheard of while the insurgents where they're trying to,

559
00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:00.440
you know, uh,

560
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:05.840
punish the populous with their psychotic brand

561
00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:09.950
of, of Al-Qaeda Islam. Right. And, and the,

562
00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:13.100
the people from ADI did not want that at all.

563
00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:18.340
And so from that perspective, it's like, I go to sleep every night.

564
00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:18.440
<v 0>Yeah.</v>
