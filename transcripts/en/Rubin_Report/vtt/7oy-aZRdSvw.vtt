1
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.890
<v 0>Uh, cause money. They like money.</v>

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.580
Everything we do is this is where my tech nerd side comes in.

3
00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:10.020
Everything they do is to keep people on that platform longer and to keep them

4
00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:13.620
looking at more ads and watching more videos and earning them more ad revenue,

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.000
they have no reason to get rid of 70 something, million people like this.

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.060
Like they're not going to infinity Wars us because they like our money.

7
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.880
You know, they like our eyeballs. They want to do it.

8
00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:25.320
So I don't think it's going to happen.

9
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.820
<v 2>Make some sense of all this stuff.</v>

10
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.420
Like I'm always looking around when I find voices that seem kind of sane and

11
00:00:38.421 --> 00:00:41.990
interesting and like somewhat trustworthy. How do you find people?

12
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.170
Cause people always come up. People literally come up to me at the supermarket.

13
00:00:45.171 --> 00:00:48.260
They'll be like, Dave, you're the only one I trust. And I'm always like, well,

14
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.240
we got a big problem here.

15
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.850
<v 0>People say that to me too. They're like,</v>

16
00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:56.510
you're the only one that tells the truth. And I really pride myself on that.

17
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.880
I'll keep telling him the truth and throwing in my silliness.

18
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.050
And the fun part is that I love being wrong because then I get to learn the

19
00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:06.740
right thing. So I don't even care if I'm wrong, but I trust.

20
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.600
I'd say I trust you. I trust Ben Shapiro minus 10%.

21
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.620
Cause I'll just make up for the facility. Cause it's in there. Um,

22
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.390
I trust Rogan's show Joe Rogan's show. Um,

23
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.580
and it's not even that I trust their opinions.

24
00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:24.260
I just trust that they like to learn.

25
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.100
So his guests and him they'll work their way through. I like that.

26
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.660
I trust Erica,

27
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.280
who is the CEO of Barstool sports and pretty much the whole Barstool

28
00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:38.180
sports crew. I think they tell it like it is to Dan.

29
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.960
<v 2>Crazy. That Barstool has to be so involved in politics though. Right?</v>

30
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.800
<v 0>It's really funny. It's really, really funny.</v>

31
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.930
And this is why I'm saying the pendulum's coming back. When this,

32
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.220
the people who were supposed to be serious, I've got crazy.

33
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.330
Then the crazies are going to have to take over and we're running the asylum and

34
00:01:59.331 --> 00:02:02.240
we have more experience. This is the thing they don't,

35
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.370
they don't get it they're out. And when we go crazy,

36
00:02:04.371 --> 00:02:05.540
we're going to be way better than them.

37
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.000
<v 2>But are you afraid that if Trump does not pull off this stuff with the</v>

38
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:14.870
lawsuits and stuff and Biden becomes president that at that point,

39
00:02:14.871 --> 00:02:18.020
why wouldn't big tech, just get rid of all of us, you know,

40
00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:19.670
they're calling us all Nazis anyway,

41
00:02:19.671 --> 00:02:23.090
the entire political establishment will say you're a bunch of Nazi Trump

42
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.920
supporters, big tech. Well, I don't like to say it publicly,

43
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.843
obviously.

44
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.810
<v 0>Okay. I was, I was under the impression this on YouTube.</v>

45
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.600
Oh, okay. All right. Yeah. I'm so sorry. Like I thought you were like gay Nazi.

46
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.820
Yeah, my bad.

47
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.300
<v 2>But, but really like, are, are you afraid of that? That like, why wouldn't,</v>

48
00:02:44.301 --> 00:02:47.180
you know, you've built your life and career and all that goodness.

49
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.870
On the two on the pipes of YouTube and Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and

50
00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:52.640
all that. Like, are you worried that, you know,

51
00:02:52.641 --> 00:02:56.300
January 20 rolls around Biden's president and within the next couple of weeks,

52
00:02:56.301 --> 00:03:01.030
like why would big tech not just boot everybody deplorable and a bad guy in a

53
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:02.020
Nazi and the rest of it?

54
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.880
<v 0>Uh, cause money, they like money.</v>

55
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.540
Everything we do is this is where my tech nerd side comes in.

56
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.010
Everything they do is to keep people on that platform longer and to keep them

57
00:03:14.011 --> 00:03:17.610
looking at more ads and watching more videos and earning them more ad revenue,

58
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.990
they have no reason to get rid of 70 something. Million people like this.

59
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.050
Like they're not going to infinity Wars us because they like our money.

60
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.870
You know, they're like our eyeballs. They want to do it.

61
00:03:27.871 --> 00:03:30.900
So I don't think it's going to happen. It's not in their best interests.

62
00:03:30.901 --> 00:03:34.860
And this is what I hope. TV hop, TV network,

63
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.840
TV networks learn too many thoughts at once. Red bull, um,

64
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.870
slowdown woman. I'm trying, I'm trying,

65
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.880
there's playing to one side and there's 70 other million people to entertain

66
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.200
you. Dumb asses. Guess what? All those people do. They buy toilet paper,

67
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.550
they buy makeup. They buy hair products. You clearly do. Wow. Um,

68
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.100
it's it's wow. It's amazing.

69
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.560
<v 2>We tore it together. I mean the hair game, if we toured together,</v>

70
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.970
would you seriously, like.

71
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.930
<v 0>Let's just have our hair on. T-shirts like just that lens of our hair.</v>

72
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.830
<v 2>That'd be fine. Dave, Nicole.</v>

73
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.010
<v 0>And Dave. That's my brother's name too. So it's fun. Um, yeah.</v>

74
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.910
I just think it would be really stupid of them economically to not start playing

75
00:04:17.911 --> 00:04:20.790
to the other half of America and North America.

76
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.770
People forget that Canadians very much follow American politics and chime in on

77
00:04:25.771 --> 00:04:29.820
it because we're attached. Wear your hat and uh, yeah.

78
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.450
<v 2>What's going on with what's going on with your guy up there. Trudeau,</v>

79
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.650
you must love that guy. Huh?

80
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.440
<v 0>That robot malfunctioned a while ago.</v>

81
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.810
We got to like hear hearing him in between

82
00:04:42.811 --> 00:04:45.330
doing black face, telling us how to be good.

83
00:04:45.331 --> 00:04:49.650
People is just it's too much for me. He talks in a fake robot voice.

84
00:04:49.651 --> 00:04:52.380
Now it's it's just too much.

85
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.840
<v 2>How did he, how did he win a reelection?</v>

86
00:04:54.841 --> 00:04:58.350
Like cause most Western countries and now it's a little up in the air with us,

87
00:04:58.351 --> 00:05:01.500
but in the last like five years, most Western countries, they,

88
00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:03.960
they went to the right, but you guys,

89
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.660
you went the other way and now he's talking great reset.

90
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.730
The humanoid that he is.

91
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.940
<v 0>Reset. Okay. Bring it. Um,</v>

92
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.200
which is probably why I get at least a hundred people asking me every day to run

93
00:05:16.201 --> 00:05:20.010
for prime minister and they're not kidding. And I've had financial backers.

94
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.430
<v 2>They asked me if I would do it, they want me to run for governor of California.</v>

95
00:05:23.431 --> 00:05:26.310
Now you see what you say? How stupid is this?

96
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.800
<v 0>I mean, Arnold kind of broke the mold for us like years ago.</v>

97
00:05:31.801 --> 00:05:35.820
So that's pretty good, but I don't want to be prime minister.

98
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.530
The salary cap is 180,000 Canadian that's frankly like, nah,

99
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.750
you know, for all that pressure, that's like $23 American got into it.

100
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.490
Um, but yeah, that takes me down another tangent.

101
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.270
<v 2>What do you think of Trudeau? Like, like what,</v>

102
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.040
what is happening in Canada? He's going to.

103
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.740
<v 0>Be out soon. The thing is we just didn't care enough.</v>

104
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.660
Canadians follow American politics more than we follow

105
00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:08.780
Canadian politics. It just is what it is. Yours is more entertaining.

106
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.440
It's more fun. The characters are better. It's a good reality show.

107
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.440
Ours is kind of like why, why? And we're too polite.

108
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.970
There's not a lot of fighting in our house of commons and we just kind of let

109
00:06:19.971 --> 00:06:24.800
things skirt by until suddenly this is talking about the great reset and his

110
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:26.810
robot voice. Um,

111
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.520
then it's getting a little weird and he's fighting with the premier of Ontario

112
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.900
about giving the cash advances to small businesses that they promised over a

113
00:06:35.901 --> 00:06:39.920
month ago. Then I'm like, okay, who's who we tagging in here.

114
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.820
Cause now someone has to go take this guy out like election wise.

115
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:44.930
Not like take him out. Yeah.

116
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.310
<v 2>I got it. You're not calling for the assassination of Justin.</v>

117
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.470
<v 0>Calling for the assassination of Justin Trudeau. Facebook. Did you hear that?</v>

118
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.280
Okay. I've gotten in trouble for jokes before.

119
00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.480
<v 2>Listen, the media matters people.</v>

120
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:02.860
They watch this show with a keen eye waiting for me to pause the wrong way or

121
00:07:02.861 --> 00:07:07.030
for one of my guests to accidentally say something because Skype freaked out for

122
00:07:07.031 --> 00:07:11.500
a moment. So we have to be very careful. You do not want Justin. Yeah.

123
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.290
These people are pathetic, ridiculous fools.

124
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.110
<v 0>Oh, tell me,</v>

125
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.950
you should really think at least they didn't send you to your fiery death to

126
00:07:20.951 --> 00:07:22.600
rescue horses that were fine.

127
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.250
<v 2>You see, there you go. You wait, do you guys think it's a little weird?</v>

128
00:07:27.251 --> 00:07:30.790
You guys, you Canadians, we don't really understand you people up North.

129
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.970
Do you guys think it's weird? The way that, that we,

130
00:07:33.971 --> 00:07:38.860
that it seems like our issues have been imported into Canadian shores because

131
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.370
every gig that I did in Canada and when I was with Jordan and when I've done

132
00:07:42.371 --> 00:07:43.204
solo gigs,

133
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:48.340
people are crazed and starving for the types of things that I talk about.

134
00:07:48.341 --> 00:07:51.850
And I did an event with, um, Maxime Bernier,

135
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.620
who was the people's party of Canada, you know,

136
00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:56.050
basically the libertarian candidate for prime minister.

137
00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:00.220
And we did an event and Antifa was there and they were throwing things and

138
00:08:00.221 --> 00:08:02.680
attacking us and screaming, Nazi that video.

139
00:08:02.681 --> 00:08:04.720
You probably saw that video of the woman with the Walker,

140
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:05.860
trying to cross the street.

141
00:08:05.861 --> 00:08:09.760
That was tough for me to come to Canada to talk about free speech, like insane.

142
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:10.720
But, but,

143
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.270
and then you have all these people in there screaming black lives matter and all

144
00:08:13.271 --> 00:08:14.800
this stuff. And it's like, well,

145
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.470
is there a problem with police shootings in Canada?

146
00:08:17.471 --> 00:08:18.790
And does it have anything to do with race?

147
00:08:18.791 --> 00:08:21.730
And then you ask them and they're like, no, no. That's like, well, what,

148
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:22.780
what are you screaming about?

149
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.410
<v 0>No, just we want to play. Yeah. We want to play too.</v>

150
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.900
Like literally I just, when Canadians start going off issues,

151
00:08:31.901 --> 00:08:36.100
I laugh most of the time because I would say our number one issue.

152
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:40.630
If we have issues outside of pandemic and stuff like that is environmental it's

153
00:08:40.631 --> 00:08:44.380
where are we going to lay pipeline? Uh, for natural oil? What, you know,

154
00:08:44.381 --> 00:08:47.560
indigenous lands, can we go through? What's not cool. Let's,

155
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.350
let's make peace with the indigenous indigenous people.

156
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.740
Those are the real issues Canadians have. And I'd say,

157
00:08:53.741 --> 00:08:57.060
number one is environmental. Other than that, we're kind of chill.

158
00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.980
And I think that makes some people antsy.

159
00:08:58.981 --> 00:09:01.680
So they make up problems just like everyone else in the world.

160
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.930
They have nothing to complain about it. So they make it up.

161
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.320
I just remembered something. I don't think I told you. Did I ever,

162
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.470
did I ever tell you that I messaged you while you were in Hamilton,

163
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:14.730
Ontario during all that, and that was for that gig, right?

164
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.990
Yeah. I didn't know you yet, but I saw that that was happening.

165
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:20.250
And I reached out to,

166
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:25.170
I think on Instagram and I offered you another venue with a ton of

167
00:09:25.171 --> 00:09:29.490
security. Yeah. If you ever need help in Hilton.

168
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:33.650
<v 2>This is going to sound very. I don't run my Instagram.</v>

169
00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.620
<v 0>That's okay. It does, but it's okay.</v>

170
00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.760
<v 2>No, I mean, I got a guy that runs it and sometimes messages,</v>

171
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.220
sometimes things slip through. Well, I appreciate it. I mean,

172
00:09:43.221 --> 00:09:47.450
that thing really was, I was like, I cannot believe this is happening in Canada.

173
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.900
I got people screaming that I'm a Nazi, the three speakers on stage.

174
00:09:50.901 --> 00:09:53.780
You had a Christian or Jew and a Muslim on stage or they're screaming that it's

175
00:09:53.781 --> 00:09:55.070
a white supremacist event.

176
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:59.300
<v 0>You guys failed at white supremacy. So hard. Yes.</v>

177
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.890
<v 2>Hard. So hard. Hitler would be Hitler would be very, very disappointed.</v>

178
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.880
So I was about to ask you what's next for you, but I think we know what's next,

179
00:10:07.881 --> 00:10:10.700
which is you got some sort of late night situation coming. That's awesome.

180
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.220
<v 0>I do. And it's going to be fun.</v>

181
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:17.240
And I know I sound a little like evil villain about it, but that's how I feel.

182
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:21.620
I feel like, okay, you guys want to play, you pushed good people this far,

183
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.190
the people's champions are rising up. We're going to swing.

184
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.760
And I can't just be like, Oh, it's just me. I'm going to take on everybody.

185
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.750
There's a fricking X-Men crew rising up right now. And man,

186
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.010
I feel bad for SNL.

187
00:10:34.011 --> 00:10:36.890
I feel bad for these people that are stuck in the little boxes.

188
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.160
Can't say what they want. Can't be real comics because yeah,

189
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:41.330
the good ones are coming.

190
