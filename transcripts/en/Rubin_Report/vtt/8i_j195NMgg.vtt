1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.910
<v 0>I'm not bullish on California. And that ain't me.</v>

2
00:00:02.911 --> 00:00:07.830
I've talked to some very smart people who are economic animals and all of

3
00:00:07.831 --> 00:00:12.720
them agree, and all of them are looking to get out because it's too expensive.

4
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.730
Why? Well, I live in on skid row, basically. I'm in Venice.

5
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.950
I've been in Venice for twenty-five years. I love it,

6
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.360
but I don't recognize my town anymore as much. And you know,

7
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.690
it's gotten really bad over there, right? It's not just gotten very bad.

8
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:32.370
It's become profitable because developers now can get these

9
00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:35.160
government contracts. I mean, I can build you.

10
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.460
I can build you a bunch of apartments for $200 million on prime,

11
00:00:38.461 --> 00:00:42.000
real estate on a parking lot. And on the beach, if you'd like,

12
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:46.920
I'd be happy to do that. And we can just have, we can create a homeless, uh, um,

13
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.460
apartments people for, for people who are homeless and, uh,

14
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.470
don't worry about doing drugs or anything else.

15
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:54.930
We're not gonna put any of those restrictions on you can come and go as you

16
00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:59.100
like, you know? So, so there is something that see,

17
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.040
this is not me, but a scholar. I had a long conversation with called the,

18
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.800
the homeless industrial complex.

19
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.600
Once there's money in bidding and getting,

20
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.610
uh, homeless shelters for big developers, you better be careful.

21
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.720
<v 2>All right. We talked about New York city.</v>

22
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.060
We talked about Afghanistan seems like the segway to where we're

23
00:01:26.061 --> 00:01:27.380
at right now in California.

24
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.560
What do you make about what's going on with this state? We, we both,

25
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.480
we talked about it about a month ago on your show.

26
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.830
I was strongly considering leaving. Like I was looking at real estate.

27
00:01:36.831 --> 00:01:40.140
I had to hold a bunch of people begging me to come to Dallas.

28
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.500
I would have had a pretty sweet operation over there. Yeah.

29
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.270
My feeling right now is I want to stay in fight here. I love so Cal.

30
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.850
I love, you know, I love the weather of course and all that,

31
00:01:49.851 --> 00:01:54.710
but like I built a good life here. We've got friends. I like it here.

32
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.500
It's a freaking mess. Absolute mess.

33
00:01:57.501 --> 00:01:59.930
I think you were at a bit of a similar situation.

34
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.980
<v 0>I, I didn't think about staying in fighting until I spoke to you and I've not,</v>

35
00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:07.310
I haven't stopped thinking about that. And I think you're right. Um,

36
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.650
I was just in Austin looking at property and boy does that. Ugh.

37
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.360
<v 2>I know we probably, I told you,</v>

38
00:02:14.361 --> 00:02:16.820
you were probably looking at the same houses I'm on truly like, man,

39
00:02:16.821 --> 00:02:17.930
when I can get in Austin.

40
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.650
<v 0>Normally I can save. It's cheaper to live. It's the, you know,</v>

41
00:02:21.651 --> 00:02:26.510
I don't pay that 13% tax or whatever it is or 18%. Um, so yeah,

42
00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:30.050
I could save a lot of money and um, what's happening in California.

43
00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:32.900
It seems as businesses are leaving for just that reason,

44
00:02:32.901 --> 00:02:35.270
because it's very expensive to do business here.

45
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.620
What California has going forward is a very diversified economy and amazing

46
00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:43.850
weather. Um, and it's just a huge, important state for a lot of reasons.

47
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:47.960
But California was the state that worked and we have a

48
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.130
democratic super majority. And uh,

49
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.340
if you look at local POL politics, it's, it's just,

50
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.130
anytime you have a super majority of any group,

51
00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.740
I don't care if it's Republican Democrat.

52
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:02.860
I don't think that's good for democracy. Um, your vote,

53
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:07.210
if you are someone who leans even a little bit, right? Doesn't count, save it,

54
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:12.130
stay home. We don't care. And you aren't getting elected to local office.

55
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.790
You're not getting elected to, to government office. You're not,

56
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.930
unless you are a pro big union across the board. Good luck,

57
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.860
good luck otherwise. And I'm a member of a union I'm in stag.

58
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.340
So I understand the value of unions, but

59
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.520
it's expensive to do business.

60
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.380
And unless you can push back a little bit or come up with a compromise, I don't,

61
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.770
I don't, I'm not bullish on California. And that ain't me.

62
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:43.720
I've talked to some very smart people who are economic animals and all of

63
00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:48.610
them agree. And all of them are looking to get out because it's too expensive.

64
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.590
Why what I live in on skid row, basically I'm in Venice.

65
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.840
I've been in Venice for 25 years. I love it,

66
00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.250
but I don't recognize my town anymore as much. And you know,

67
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.580
it's gotten really bad over there, right? It's not just gotten very bad.

68
00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:08.260
It's become profitable because developers now can get these

69
00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:11.050
government contracts. I mean, I can build you.

70
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.250
I can build you a bunch of apartments for $200 million on prime real estate on a

71
00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:18.910
parking lot. And on the beach, if you'd like, I'd be happy to do that.

72
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.780
Then we can just have, we can create a homeless, uh, um,

73
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.350
apartments people for, for people who are homeless and, uh,

74
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.360
don't worry about doing drugs or anything else.

75
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:29.860
We're not gonna put any of those restrictions on.

76
00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:34.480
You can come and go as you like. You know? So, so there is something that,

77
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.930
see, this is not me, but a scholar. I had a long conversation with called the,

78
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.690
the homeless industrial complex.

79
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.460
Once there's money in bidding and getting,

80
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.590
uh, homeless shelters for big developers, you better be careful.

81
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.380
So these people need to be put in treatment.

82
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.130
And the majority of the people on the street, it's not a housing problem.

83
00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.530
It's not a housing problem. It's not a housing problem.

84
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.860
It is a mental health and addiction problem.

85
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.910
And until we get serious about that, uh, we're, we're,

86
00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:07.960
we're going to be in big trouble.

87
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.620
<v 2>Is it weird to you watching it spread in different areas?</v>

88
00:05:10.621 --> 00:05:13.740
So Venice always had a certain amount of that. Now it's definitely more,

89
00:05:13.741 --> 00:05:14.880
but like Hollywood,

90
00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:18.840
which also always had a certain amount it's like kind of taken over Hollywood.

91
00:05:18.841 --> 00:05:19.980
If you just go to straight up,

92
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.340
especially now where there aren't as many other people on the streets. Now,

93
00:05:23.341 --> 00:05:27.030
it just seems like all there are kind of like transient people and homeless and

94
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.800
tents and well, and as that inches closer to West Hollywood now,

95
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.180
and it'll Lynch closer to Beverly Hills and that, that then is my back.

96
00:05:35.181 --> 00:05:36.560
Then it gets pushed.

97
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.850
<v 0>Yeah. Well, you know, they have their own police force, but yeah,</v>

98
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.120
prop 47 and you can't, it's not criminalized. There are all kinds of these.

99
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.530
I voted for prop 47 because the way it was phrased and it had the, it had the,

100
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.160
again on the ballot I'm as I'm voting, I went, well, this makes sense.

101
00:05:50.161 --> 00:05:54.290
I don't want kids to be in a revolving door of crime and police chiefs back it.

102
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.100
And did you read the whole thing? I didn't that's I didn't have time.

103
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.960
<v 2>I am remiss, but that's how they get you in this state.</v>

104
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.120
I think more than any other during the last election,

105
00:06:04.121 --> 00:06:07.690
there was this one thing on the ballot about, um, you know, do you want it,

106
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.320
it was something like this. Do you want to put $500 million, uh,

107
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.260
into education for, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

108
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.770
And then there's essay just a giant, crazy essay on the whole thing.

109
00:06:17.771 --> 00:06:20.230
And I skipped all the way to the bottom. And on the bottom, it says,

110
00:06:20.231 --> 00:06:24.820
this can only be repealed or reversed by popular vote,

111
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.350
but nobody ever says, okay, now we'll take the money from the kids,

112
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.180
but that's government one Oh one,

113
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.180
he sell it exactly the packaging thing you're talking about.

114
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.010
Nobody reads the fine print.

115
00:06:36.011 --> 00:06:38.350
And then you throw it back on the people to be like, Oh,

116
00:06:38.351 --> 00:06:39.460
you'll have to take care of this.

117
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.390
<v 0>There's always blow back. There's always a ripple effect. You bet.</v>

118
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.210
No matter what the intentions are, you know,

119
00:06:46.211 --> 00:06:49.600
we've spent something like $3 trillion on programs for the poor.

120
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.730
How's that going? How's it going? You know, it, it, it's very difficult.

121
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.390
I think at the end of the day, it's not about right or left.

122
00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.410
You got to ask yourself,

123
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.310
do you really think that a bloated bureaucracy called the federal government is

124
00:07:03.311 --> 00:07:06.970
the first line of defense? Is that the best way to solve these problems?

125
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.970
Is it I don't, I don't, I don't think so.

126
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:15.100
Is government going to keep families intact is a government official or a

127
00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:19.780
bureaucrat who studies family law or whatever, going to keep your family intact.

128
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.900
Are they gonna, are they gonna get you to take care of your kids?

129
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.650
Are they going to get you the skill set you need in the 21st century?

130
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:30.970
The ever-changing 21st century? I it's a question. Yeah.

131
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.670
Maybe the answer is yes. In some cases,

132
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.280
but I don't know if that's always the question, the answer.

133
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:40.060
And you've got to ask those questions. The problem we run into is we go, well,

134
00:07:40.061 --> 00:07:42.150
I'm a Republican, I'm a Democrat. I'm left. I'm right there.

135
00:07:42.151 --> 00:07:45.160
There's nothing to hold on. Hold on. Let's let's go into,

136
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:49.540
what percentage of your money do you want to give the government? Every year,

137
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:53.410
every day I pay something like 52% in taxes.

138
00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:54.700
So half my day,

139
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.810
half my year is working for someone else half my day,

140
00:07:58.811 --> 00:08:03.700
half my year is working for someone else. So how much more do you want from me?
