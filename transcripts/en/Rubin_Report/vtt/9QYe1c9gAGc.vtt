00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.890
<v 0>You saw him yesterday in Pennsylvania where they, you know,</v>

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.810
they managed to let them out of the basement basically.

3
00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:07.680
So they could cut an ad to make it look like he's actually out there. You know,

4
00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:09.120
it's all from the same shot, but you know,

5
00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:11.520
Joe Biden was out of his basement miraculously for a few minutes,

6
00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:15.780
but he forgets where he is. He forgets his wife from his sister.

7
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.960
He forgets the office. He's running for he's, he's looking at notes.

8
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:22.470
You see him. I mean, he literally read the subtext of the teleprompter stuff.

9
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:25.860
It looks like he's trying to give an organic interview when he's reading the

10
00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:28.170
bullet points on a teleprompter because he can't remember them.

11
00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:30.750
And now you compare that with, okay, two brain aneurysms.

12
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.900
It's probably an issue, nothing to see here, folks. I mean,

13
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.040
the cause and effect is so flavored and it, it would be sad, Dave,

14
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.050
if it wasn't so scary for our country.

15
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.600
<v 1>So I read about him.</v>

16
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.020
<v 2>This morning and you just laid out a lot of the arguments that you made.</v>

17
00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:53.710
And when I was, when I was looking at it, I was thinking, you know, the,

18
00:00:53.711 --> 00:00:58.340
the alternate title basically for this book could have been double standards,

19
00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:00.320
right? Cause that's really what you're,

20
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.640
that's really what you're saying in this book that if my family did these

21
00:01:04.641 --> 00:01:06.980
things, this is how the media would have portrayed it.

22
00:01:06.981 --> 00:01:10.490
If my dad had made these decisions, this is what would happen.

23
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.510
And if I had gotten the benefits that say Hunter Biden had gotten,

24
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.130
this is how the media would have dealt it. I I've said a lot of people as,

25
00:01:19.131 --> 00:01:21.740
as I've gotten more comfortable, let's say with your dad,

26
00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:24.740
a lot of people will say to me, well, I don't get it, Dave, how could you,

27
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.630
how could you support Trump? How, how is he,

28
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.150
how come you don't think he's the devil, all of that kind of stuff.

29
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.530
And what I always say is, well,

30
00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:35.450
he understood the media more than anything else that it

31
00:01:35.451 --> 00:01:38.630
wasn't just, it wasn't just Republicans versus Democrats.

32
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.680
It was Republicans versus Democrats. Plus the media. That,

33
00:01:42.681 --> 00:01:45.920
that to me seems to be a huge thrust of what this book is. Is it,

34
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.950
does it all boil down to the double standards thing for you?

35
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.120
<v 0>Yeah, I mean, yes. And even, and more right. I mean,</v>

36
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.290
cause it's not just a double standard, it's just flagrant mistakes. I mean,

37
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.150
if you're just looking at what's going on today, that, you know,

38
00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:02.180
there was another fake report, you know, Donald Trump suffered, uh,

39
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.180
mini strokes, you know, now, and he had to be treated at Walter Reed.

40
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.850
Now the doctors at Walter Reed said, this is nonsense. It's untrue,

41
00:02:07.851 --> 00:02:10.220
but the media won't even talk about Joe Biden.

42
00:02:10.221 --> 00:02:14.840
Who's literally had two brain surgeries for literally

43
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.410
brain aneurysms. He had explosions in his brain. Now,

44
00:02:18.411 --> 00:02:20.780
if you ask a doctor about that,

45
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.830
what are the chances that you could be a hundred percent normal after one re you

46
00:02:24.831 --> 00:02:28.160
know, brain surgery that, you know, after an aneurysm, they'd say very little,

47
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.950
how about to almost impossible to be normal.

48
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.700
Now you take that with Joe Biden's daily, daily.

49
00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:36.560
You saw him yesterday in Pennsylvania where they, you know,

50
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.450
they managed to let them out of the basement basically.

51
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.350
So they could cut an ad to make it look like he's actually out there. You know,

52
00:02:42.351 --> 00:02:43.790
it's all from the same shot. But you know,

53
00:02:43.791 --> 00:02:46.190
Joe Biden was out of his basement miraculously for a few minutes,

54
00:02:46.191 --> 00:02:50.450
but he forgets where he is. He forgets his wife from his sister.

55
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.630
He forgets the office. He's running for he's, he's looking at notes.

56
00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:57.140
You see him. I mean, he literally read the subtext of the teleprompter stuff.

57
00:02:57.141 --> 00:03:00.520
It looks like he's trying to give an organic interview when he's reading the

58
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:02.830
bullet points on a teleprompter, because he can't remember them.

59
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:05.410
And now you compare that with, okay, two brain aneurysms.

60
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.560
It's probably an issue, nothing to see here, folks. I mean,

61
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.700
the cause and effect is so flagrant and it, it would be sad, Dave,

62
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.280
if it wasn't so scary for our country, you know,

63
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:19.960
Joe Biden is basically he's camouflage for the far left. They can try it.

64
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.200
The media will spend billions trying to sell him to middle America.

65
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.940
It's moderate Joe, moderate Joe. But you know,

66
00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:28.510
you're not a moderate with Kamala as your VP. You're not a moderate with Bedo.

67
00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:31.060
Hell yeah. I'll take your AR 15 O'Rourke as your guns are.

68
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.990
You're sure as heck not a moderate with the Bernie Sanders joint unity platform,

69
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:39.160
which is like a con combination of like the new age communist manifesto with the

70
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:43.720
green new deal blended into one. And again, the media won't talk about that.

71
00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:46.030
So when you talk about, you know, double standard,

72
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:49.120
it's not even that because the playing field is so uneven with a mainstream

73
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:52.450
media. That's what, 96% negative against Donald Trump. I mean,

74
00:03:52.451 --> 00:03:54.220
that's a lot of ground to overcome.

75
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:56.950
They won't talk about the good things you saw while you may have been off the

76
00:03:56.951 --> 00:04:00.430
grid when this happened, but they got a peace deal done in the middle East.

77
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.013
I mean,

78
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.070
this is the Holy grail of geopolitical politics hasn't been done in a quarter of

79
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:06.904
a century.

80
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.260
They spent more time last week fact checking my three-year-old nephew.

81
00:04:11.261 --> 00:04:14.290
If in fact he did build a Lego white house for my father.

82
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.190
Now there's a picture of it,

83
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.000
but they spend more time talking about that because Ivanka mentioned in her

84
00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:22.120
speech attacking a three-year-old now, I mean, you know, Nick, Sandeman,

85
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.950
that's 60. They destroyed him. I figured, okay,

86
00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:25.180
they wouldn't go much lower than that,

87
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:27.820
but now they're going to a three-year-old to attack him.

88
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.740
But the average American has no idea.

89
00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:33.640
We signed a peace deal in the middle East and you know,

90
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:35.950
that's the insanity we're up against. So that's why this book,

91
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.660
it's not just for, you know,

92
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.320
people on the right it's for people in the middle who are undecided,

93
00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:44.290
because if you're undecided and you're sort of going 50 50, either way,

94
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.530
imagine you actually knew about Joe Biden and his policies.

95
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.470
Imagine you actually heard about the Trump administration successes,

96
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.560
neither of which you've been made aware of.

97
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.290
That's what this book is it's designed to inform. And again,

98
00:04:56.291 --> 00:04:59.560
it's more for the people in the middle that aren't sure than it is anything else

99
00:04:59.561 --> 00:05:01.360
because someone had to step up and do it.

100
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.490
<v 2>So in the, in the chapter about the Biden health stuff,</v>

101
00:05:05.491 --> 00:05:07.740
where you talk about the brain aneurysms and everything else,

102
00:05:07.741 --> 00:05:11.820
and you refer to Obama's doctor and a bunch of other medical professionals in

103
00:05:11.821 --> 00:05:12.150
it,

104
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.060
and you actually go out of your way to make a point that you're not trying to

105
00:05:15.061 --> 00:05:18.050
mock the guy and you, and you have sympathy for this kind of stuff. Like you're,

106
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.120
you're not being a Dick about it. You really not. Yeah. Um,

107
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.670
one thing that you sort of hint at is basically, and,

108
00:05:24.671 --> 00:05:26.370
and you sort of implied this already,

109
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.840
that he's just kind of a puppet for something. What,

110
00:05:30.841 --> 00:05:34.560
what do you really think that thing is like, is it,

111
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.540
is it the party apparatus,

112
00:05:36.541 --> 00:05:39.930
like who really is in charge of the DNC at this point?

113
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.090
<v 0>Well, I think it's the radical left. I mean,</v>

114
00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:44.190
you saw that you saw that if you watch the DNC,

115
00:05:44.191 --> 00:05:48.860
I don't know if you came out of hiding it from that one. If you didn't catch it,

116
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.450
it'll save you a lot of grief. Because if you watch that, you know,

117
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.960
you'd think that America was the most oppressive regime ever created in the

118
00:05:54.961 --> 00:05:58.730
world. And that it's a terrible place. And you, again, I watched for five days,

119
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.030
not one person mentioned the looting, the writing, the violence going,

120
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.900
not one at the DNC, they had a week instead, they painted this picture of,

121
00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:08.360
you know, America is a terrible place. If you like anything about it,

122
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:10.760
you're a terrible human being. And you know,

123
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.120
that's the thing I wasn't trying to make light of dementia or Alzheimer's.

124
00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:15.830
I mean, we all know people affected by it.

125
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.290
The difference is those people can have a great life.

126
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.700
They can be great parents and grandparents and have,

127
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.490
we're not going to give them the nuclear fleet. Well, it w we're gonna,

128
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.400
we're gonna just pretend that it didn't happen and say, congratulations,

129
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.030
here's the largest economy in the world. Here's the nuclear football. I mean,

130
00:06:31.031 --> 00:06:34.150
if Joe Biden needs notes to talk to a reporter,

131
00:06:34.151 --> 00:06:37.600
that's literally trying to love him softballs. How's he going to compete again?

132
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.750
China and Russia and Iran.

133
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.710
Like he can't remember where he is. I mean, so, you know, it's,

134
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.120
it's either insane or it's a cloak and dagger type of thing where they,

135
00:06:49.121 --> 00:06:50.350
you know, they cover Europe.

136
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.320
They pretend it's moderate Joe from Scranton of which he's not. I mean,

137
00:06:53.321 --> 00:06:54.490
he's not blue collar, Joey.

138
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.730
He got his first elected official office in DC when he was in his twenties,

139
00:06:57.731 --> 00:06:59.770
like it's never had a blue collar job, but you know,

140
00:06:59.771 --> 00:07:03.310
he's curated this sort of lie to market himself as this way.

141
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.130
So the radical left, who is actually making all the decisions again,

142
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.380
his platform on his website is Bernie Sanders is right. Yo, his VP is coming,

143
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:11.891
Oh, Harris,

144
00:07:11.891 --> 00:07:15.280
who's literally left of Bernie Sanders in terms of voting record in the Senate.

145
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.983
Like, do you think Joe,

146
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.810
Biden's going to be able to stand up to them if they're pushing for certain

147
00:07:19.811 --> 00:07:24.580
things. No, but the media can use him as cammo sell to middle America. No, no,

148
00:07:24.581 --> 00:07:26.890
no. It's not going to be that radical. It's not going to be that bad.

149
00:07:26.891 --> 00:07:28.840
But all you have to do is look at his platform. I mean,

150
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.640
$4 trillion tax hike to middle-class America give free healthcare to illegals,

151
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.490
free education, to illegals,

152
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.610
free lawyers for the other ones that will start flooding our country.

153
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.040
Like who's that gonna hurt? Probably not me.

154
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.700
It's going to hurt our lowest income earners, right? Who's that going to hurt?

155
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.600
How about you in a public school that you have the privilege of having to pay

156
00:07:49.601 --> 00:07:52.300
for yet again, right? You don't get free healthcare.

157
00:07:52.301 --> 00:07:54.940
You don't get free education for your kids, certainly not college or anything,

158
00:07:55.510 --> 00:08:00.010
but you have the privilege of paying for illegals to get those benefits because

159
00:08:00.011 --> 00:08:03.040
it creates Democrat voters. I mean, think about how insane that is.

160
00:08:03.041 --> 00:08:06.730
It's not like our systems have all this excess capacity that they can handle it.

161
00:08:06.731 --> 00:08:08.230
I mean, they're already overworked.

162
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.010
Our medical system is already overstressed our education system. Honestly,

163
00:08:12.011 --> 00:08:16.600
our public education system is a disaster. It's 28th in the world spending more,

164
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.990
more money per child than any country in the world. It's still 28. I mean,

165
00:08:19.991 --> 00:08:23.920
there are literally third world countries that are beating us in education and

166
00:08:23.921 --> 00:08:27.100
the teacher's union is really sure they don't want to go back to do in-person,

167
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:32.650
but they also don't want to do online learning also of their platforms since

168
00:08:32.651 --> 00:08:35.830
you've been gone is they want to support BLM and defund the police.

169
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:38.260
What does that have to do with educating our children?

170
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.540
These are the radicals that we're going to be in charge.

171
00:08:40.541 --> 00:08:41.920
And if you just look at Joe Biden,

172
00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:45.130
you see the way he has to be carried off the stage after he gives a speech or,

173
00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:48.310
you know, speech, I say speech loosely because you know,

174
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.190
the hardest job in America is being his sign language interpreter because

175
00:08:51.191 --> 00:08:52.600
everyone, no one knows what that is going on.

176
00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:56.040
If you're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations, politics.
