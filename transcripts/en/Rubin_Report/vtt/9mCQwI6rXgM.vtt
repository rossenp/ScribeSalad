<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.270
<v 1>Marine Corps, veteran followed and harassed by Antifa,</v>

3
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.930
just for trying to open a dialogue with these protesters in Portland,

4
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.220
their answer bylands hosts of the Rubin report.

5
00:00:25.221 --> 00:00:28.670
Dave Rubin joins me now with reaction to that and more. All right, Dave,

6
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.270
thanks for being with us. Now, I understand that this gentleman,

7
00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:36.890
for more than 50 nights, uh, Gabriel Johnson, a retired Marine,

8
00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:41.840
48 years of age had been kept awake by the sound of the rioting and the

9
00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:44.570
explosions taking place outside his window.

10
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.320
And after two months of living in fear, um,

11
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.500
he said that he decided to go out and he said,

12
00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:56.480
at that point I had counted 82 explosions at night and thought somebody

13
00:00:56.481 --> 00:00:57.500
has to do something.

14
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.790
So he decides that he wants to go out and start talking to people.

15
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.130
It didn't end well, what can you tell us about?

16
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.310
<v 2>Yeah, well, there's so much interesting stuff here because you know,</v>

17
00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:10.670
everyone can sort of feel this split that we have in the country right now,

18
00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:13.940
whether you want to call it Democrat versus Republican left, right.

19
00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:15.560
Conservative, liberal, whatever it is.

20
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.470
But I think there's something that really underlies that,

21
00:01:18.471 --> 00:01:22.970
which is people that are willing to talk and

22
00:01:22.971 --> 00:01:27.920
challenge their beliefs and engage in and people who just believe they

23
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:32.660
are right, because they believe it. And that's good enough in and of itself and,

24
00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:34.130
and the other people.

25
00:01:34.131 --> 00:01:38.540
And I think we're seeing a lot of this and this is a really perverse example of

26
00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:41.270
it because this poor guy was followed home and everything else.

27
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.410
And all he wanted to do was converse with these people. Um, I, you know,

28
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.850
what's happening here also is that the more that the progressive mayor

29
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.180
in Portland and Seattle Angeles and say more that they just

30
00:01:56.181 --> 00:01:59.510
allow, uh, anyone want,

31
00:01:59.511 --> 00:02:01.280
because we know they can attack federal buildings.

32
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.980
You can stop cars and streets. You can attack police officers.

33
00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:07.070
You can light things on fire. I mean, the litany of things is endless.

34
00:02:07.071 --> 00:02:09.170
The more they allow that to happen.

35
00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:12.920
Well then what they're also saying is the line of what's acceptable.

36
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.100
We'll just keep moving. So why not follow someone home?

37
00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:20.360
Why not attack someone in a restaurant or attack their car or, or,

38
00:02:20.361 --> 00:02:23.300
or whatever else you want to do. And I think what,

39
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.690
what falls beneath that really is just that we are,

40
00:02:26.691 --> 00:02:29.780
if we're going to remain in a civil society, which I certainly hope we are,

41
00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:32.030
and I know you'd like to, and all your viewers want us to,

42
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.000
we better start putting some lines in the sand and saying,

43
00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:37.130
this is not going to be tolerable anymore.

44
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.350
And I think Trump's basically trying to do that,

45
00:02:39.351 --> 00:02:43.850
which is why he's bringing in the feds because these guys just won't do anything

46
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:44.684
in their own cities.

47
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.980
<v 1>But, but, but, but they've just so, you know, I mean the fence, I mean,</v>

48
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.260
we're not talking about a whole lot of them, you know,

49
00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:54.050
it's just a fence to watch the federal courthouse. You know,

50
00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:56.540
they have an obligation, they should they're required.

51
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.460
And then in all of these joint task, but you know,

52
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:04.720
the truth is that since there's the so-called bail reform,

53
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:07.810
they let these guys out. As soon as the police make the paperwork,

54
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.700
that's assuming the police make an arrest. I mean, anarchy is here,

55
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:16.120
Dave. And my concern is if they're following this guy,

56
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:20.920
a Marine Corps vet home, what's the next step.

57
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.100
Okay. There's no police to enforce the law.

58
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.570
And what if they don't like what he said? What about this guy, uh,

59
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.850
who was shot in the head? Uh,

60
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.630
because he had all of these pro-Trump signs in front of his business.

61
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.703
Now they're,

62
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.640
they're thinking that that murder may have been politically motivated.

63
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.860
<v 2>Well, this was the danger that I was warning about for about five years on my</v>

64
00:03:46.861 --> 00:03:49.830
show. Because if you call everybody a Nazi,

65
00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:54.360
if all of your political opponents are Nazis and white supremacists and bigots

66
00:03:54.361 --> 00:03:58.350
and racists and homophobes, the worst things that we can come up with, well,

67
00:03:58.351 --> 00:04:02.250
then it won't just be enough to, to defeat them in the battle of ideas.

68
00:04:02.251 --> 00:04:04.260
Of course violence will be okay.

69
00:04:04.261 --> 00:04:07.770
And now the bizarre part here is that these same people, uh,

70
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.920
who seemingly are for violence are not seemingly. We know they're for violent.

71
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.870
They also will tell you words are violent.

72
00:04:12.871 --> 00:04:16.320
So certain words apparently are too dangerous to them, but then violence.

73
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.840
That really is the, the danger of this entire movement.

74
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.410
It's not based in something that we can build the society, right?

75
00:04:25.411 --> 00:04:28.440
If you want to talk about any of the issues that they want to talk about,

76
00:04:28.441 --> 00:04:30.480
whatever they believe, okay.

77
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.650
See all sorts of people across the political spectrum that will talk to you. Uh,

78
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.860
but if your answer is we're going to, yeah, we're going to burn everything down.

79
00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:38.694
People won't get it.

80
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.140
<v 1>Dave. Alright, Dave Rubin, thanks for being with us tonight.</v>

81
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.153
