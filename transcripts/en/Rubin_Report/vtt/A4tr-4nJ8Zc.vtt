00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.200
<v 0>Kids will say, Hey, I'm, I'm a conservative, I'm a libertarian,</v>

2
00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:06.990
I believe in certain things, but I'm afraid of saying it in class.

3
00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:09.120
Should I say it in class or not? I say, well,

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.340
are you willing to get the bad grade? What,

5
00:00:12.341 --> 00:00:16.830
what they're asking is how do I do what I want to do without paying a price?

6
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.240
You can't, you can't, everything has a cost.

7
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.190
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

8
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.180
<v 2>In fact, I know your answer to this,</v>

9
00:00:32.181 --> 00:00:35.450
but do you think these things should be fought on multiple fronts?

10
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.450
Meaning there can be a more conservative answer.

11
00:00:38.451 --> 00:00:41.360
There can be a more libertarian answer. That's more free market. I mean,

12
00:00:41.361 --> 00:00:42.620
that's why I started locals.

13
00:00:42.621 --> 00:00:46.430
It was like when I I've had this disagreement with Tucker Carlson on his show

14
00:00:46.431 --> 00:00:49.440
where he wants the government to do it. And I said, well,

15
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.140
I'm going to try the free market side.

16
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.350
I don't have a problem with that argument because it's like,

17
00:00:54.351 --> 00:00:56.690
maybe we all have to hit it in different ways. Look,

18
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.490
the Prager you guys that you work with, they got into a lawsuit with YouTube is,

19
00:01:00.491 --> 00:01:05.000
is Dennis's. Or I don't want to speak for Dennis, but it's the Prager U ethos.

20
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:08.390
Like let's use the law to stop companies from doing something, of course not,

21
00:01:08.391 --> 00:01:11.750
but we're all, we're all trying to navigate very murky waters.

22
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.400
And isn't that the freest marketable.

23
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.280
<v 0>Of these different solutions to the problem.</v>

24
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.050
You're not going to be able to take down this monstrous

25
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.340
left-wing edifice with one little narrow pure solution

26
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.070
that that one little narrow, pure solution might help,

27
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.310
but you're going to need a lot of different strategies,

28
00:01:31.311 --> 00:01:33.350
a lot of different tactics to undertake.

29
00:01:33.351 --> 00:01:35.300
And so certainly everything should be on the table.

30
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.090
You don't want to do anything that is objectively wrong.

31
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.540
I'm not advocating that in any way, but if, if one.

32
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.620
<v 2>You mean we shouldn't just burn down the Google servers.</v>

33
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.710
I think there's somewhere in Utah.

34
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.000
We shouldn't just go there and put masks on and yeah, that's.

35
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.080
<v 0>You shouldn't do that, but, but certainly, I mean,</v>

36
00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:55.910
what you've done with locals is a great example, right?

37
00:01:55.911 --> 00:01:59.960
Certainly we can innovate. We can create, try to create our own institutions,

38
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:04.190
at least create the beginnings of our own institutions and enforce the law that

39
00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:08.780
is already on the books. Those two things are not contradictory to one another.

40
00:02:08.781 --> 00:02:11.420
And actually, if we do enforce the law,

41
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.480
if we do have a credible threat of enforcing the law,

42
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.420
we do have a credible threat of a competitor to one of these organizations that

43
00:02:17.421 --> 00:02:20.850
is going to increase the likelihood of success on all fronts. You know,

44
00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:23.510
w when you've got something like a Google,

45
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.720
and when you add in all the other tech companies,

46
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.430
they control the flow of internet.

47
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.530
That is an amount of power that I don't think anybody who

48
00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:35.900
is, who cares deeply about the country, or is,

49
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.990
or any of the founding fathers or any of the people who've thought about how

50
00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:40.310
this Republic is supposed to work.

51
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.370
I don't think they would be comfortable with that kind of power being

52
00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:47.570
consolidated, whether it's in a technically, a private company or not. Yeah.

53
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.930
<v 2>Does some of your belief that these things can be stopped?</v>

54
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.850
Is there a biblical, uh, sort of bedrock beneath that? I mean,

55
00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:59.740
I always say if, if David could be Goliath and maybe Dave could be Google, like,

56
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:02.320
I really do believe that that there is, we,

57
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:06.310
it is so embedded in us that the little guy can beat the big guy. That,

58
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:09.790
that makes me crazy enough to try to start my own tech company in the midst of

59
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:10.470
all this. Yeah.

60
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.980
<v 0>Oh, that's a,</v>

61
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.730
that's such a great point because I don't know that they can be beaten.

62
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.770
I don't know that the destructive left that has wrecked our

63
00:03:19.771 --> 00:03:24.180
institutions and our, our political traditions and our, our civil society.

64
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.900
I don't know that they can be beaten or beaten in my lifetime,

65
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.330
but I do know I should try. And I do know, I have no reason not to try. I mean,

66
00:03:33.331 --> 00:03:33.780
I guess,

67
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.520
I guess that would be maybe the biblical basis of it is what do I have to lose?

68
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.080
Why, why would I,

69
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.210
what would I gain by playing along and saying things that I don't believe in and

70
00:03:45.211 --> 00:03:48.450
being bullied into posting, whatever I've got to post on social media.

71
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.440
If I lose my integrity, if I lose my dignity,

72
00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:56.580
if I lose the things that I care about. So I have a slightly more pleasant life.

73
00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.260
That's not a compelling.

74
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.360
<v 2>Well, I think a lot of people watching this would say, well,</v>

75
00:04:00.361 --> 00:04:01.350
I don't want to lose my job.

76
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.290
<v 0>Yeah. And it's, uh, it's a real fear, but I mean,</v>

77
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.710
I'm sure you get this question all the time at college campuses, kids will say,

78
00:04:07.711 --> 00:04:12.270
Hey, I'm, I'm a conservative, I'm a libertarian, I believe in certain things,

79
00:04:12.271 --> 00:04:15.840
but I'm afraid of saying it in class. Should I say it in class or not? I say,

80
00:04:15.841 --> 00:04:18.270
well, are you willing to get the bad grade?

81
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.940
What they're asking is how do I do what I want to do without paying a price?

82
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.520
You can't, you can't,

83
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.260
everything has a cost for me, I've spoken at, I've said what?

84
00:04:31.261 --> 00:04:34.890
I believe it has cost me certain things. I go to bed at night,

85
00:04:34.891 --> 00:04:39.060
I'm grinning ear to ear. I sleep like a baby. I think probably you do too.

86
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.510
It's worth it to me, but there is a cost to it.

87
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.520
<v 2>Interesting. Cause I get that question all the time.</v>

88
00:04:44.521 --> 00:04:46.200
Or at least when we were allowed to travel to college,

89
00:04:46.201 --> 00:04:47.580
I just remember the old days. Um,

90
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.420
and I had once heard Ben Shapiro obviously give, uh, an answer on that,

91
00:04:51.421 --> 00:04:54.300
which was that if you're in college, that in your core classes,

92
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.000
so meaning if you want to be a doctor in your core classes,

93
00:04:57.001 --> 00:05:00.660
you probably shouldn't speak up because you do need to move ahead and you don't

94
00:05:00.661 --> 00:05:02.850
want to be screwed, but in some of your other stuff, you know,

95
00:05:02.851 --> 00:05:05.130
like lesbian dance theory, like there,

96
00:05:05.131 --> 00:05:07.470
you maybe could speak up a little bit more because it probably won't take you

97
00:05:07.471 --> 00:05:08.730
out. There was some version of that.

98
00:05:08.731 --> 00:05:10.410
I'm not totally sure if that's what he feels now.

99
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.730
And for like four or five years ago, what I would say is, um,

100
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.830
just suck it up and get the grade cause you want to get out.

101
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.720
But about four years ago, I completely changed.

102
00:05:18.721 --> 00:05:21.150
And I started taking the absolute reverse. You must speak up.

103
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.230
If you don't speak up, do your, if you're in college,

104
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.250
the world will never be easier for you. You're not going to get out of college.

105
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.330
You're not going to get out of college.

106
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.090
You have a car payment and a mortgage and a wife and a dog. And uh,

107
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.470
all of these responsibilities,

108
00:05:34.471 --> 00:05:37.860
plus all the endless nonsense of the world and suddenly be like, you know,

109
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.750
I'm going to get brave today. Like lose my job. Let's roll. Yeah.

110
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.940
So you'll never do it. So that's what I pushed now.

111
00:05:44.941 --> 00:05:48.360
But it doesn't mean it's easy. In fact, actually it means it's the reverse.

112
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.990
<v 0>This is the same argument as don't worry about the snowflakes when they get to</v>

113
00:05:51.991 --> 00:05:56.730
the real world. No, the, the real world gets realer and realer and realer.

114
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.370
And I understand prudence is a virtue and politics changes with time.

115
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.020
Politics is about circumstances.

116
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.120
So maybe it made more sense at one time to keep a little bit quiet and then

117
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:10.400
you can try to move here. But in terms of how,

118
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.570
how I would live my life with the advice I would give, no, I would say speak up.

119
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:16.220
Doesn't mean you need to go where your mag ahead,

120
00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:17.960
every time you're at the water cooler. But,

121
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:20.750
but it does mean if you're asked a question about your beliefs,

122
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.500
I would tell people what you think. I, I think it's, uh,

123
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.500
it's a good habit to get into. Let's not forget the virtues are habits.

124
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.770
And so if you, if you practice them from a young age,

125
00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:33.020
you're more likely to be able to practice them at an older age.

126
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.860
And if you don't, if you say no, when I turned 60 men, then I'm going to start,

127
00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:38.870
start practicing the virtues. Right.

128
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.260
<v 2>If going to work. And the scarier part is that it's, they,</v>

129
00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.980
I think a lot of young people think, Oh, it's when I turned 22. Yeah, right.

130
00:06:44.981 --> 00:06:48.370
Like 60, we can all accept that a 60 year old, most likely,

131
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.420
although maybe he's going through like a later midlife crisis and then maybe

132
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:53.410
it's going to do something nuts,

133
00:06:53.411 --> 00:06:57.910
but that probably involves going to Vegas and you know, hook up. Right.

134
00:06:57.911 --> 00:06:59.170
It's not the right. You don't have the right.

135
00:06:59.171 --> 00:07:01.480
You're not going to go to the Bertschi thing. Um, I'm curious,

136
00:07:01.481 --> 00:07:05.620
you sort of hit on this, but I'm curious what you think, the sort of future,

137
00:07:05.621 --> 00:07:09.100
how wide a, a future conservative tent can be,

138
00:07:09.101 --> 00:07:10.690
because I'll drop a little knowledge for,

139
00:07:10.691 --> 00:07:14.980
you knows I'm working on my second book and that's kind of the direction I'm

140
00:07:14.981 --> 00:07:16.870
going to go with it. That when I'm really,

141
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.920
it seems to me that the right broadly speaking has won the big arguments.

142
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.810
They've won the arguments on individual Liberty.

143
00:07:22.811 --> 00:07:27.550
They've won the arguments on family, uh, on belief, at least in terms of, uh,

144
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.480
as an organizer of society, maybe not at an absolute individual level.

145
00:07:31.481 --> 00:07:34.480
I think we have a little disagreement on that, which I'm happy to talk about,

146
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.090
but that the right basically got the big stuff. Right? Yeah.

147
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.380
And what I think is for someone that's on the more liberal side of that,

148
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.310
my job is to kind of make sure that they never go off the deep end too far.

149
00:07:45.311 --> 00:07:49.150
Right. Let's say, and start coming around to like, you know,

150
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.130
trying to get violence out of video games, again,

151
00:07:51.131 --> 00:07:53.500
like the right use to try to do. Right. Um,

152
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.690
but I know that there's people on the right that, you know,

153
00:07:55.691 --> 00:07:58.360
want more of a religious version of conservatism,

154
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.430
then there's obviously the libertarians. What do you,

155
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.090
do you think that thing can hold? Because I,

156
00:08:03.091 --> 00:08:06.310
I really believe that the future of Western politics, not just in America,

157
00:08:06.311 --> 00:08:09.670
in every Western nation is a center, right. Future,

158
00:08:09.671 --> 00:08:12.850
I think we're seeing that happen across the world right now. Um, but how,

159
00:08:12.851 --> 00:08:16.390
why do you think that thing can be to, to not to become too big?

160
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.130
I think you don't need to.

161
00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:22.150
<v 0>Worry as much about the breadth as the object,</v>

162
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.010
what you're fighting against,

163
00:08:24.011 --> 00:08:27.100
because I do think that there is a lot of space on the right,

164
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:31.030
but it's not going to be the same tent that we saw in the cold war,

165
00:08:31.031 --> 00:08:35.170
for instance. So you will never find a greater admirer of William F. Buckley Jr.

166
00:08:35.171 --> 00:08:38.800
And Ronald Reagan than me. Okay. I really admire those guys.

167
00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.000
They fought their battle.

168
00:08:40.001 --> 00:08:43.510
They were fighting the Soviet union and they cobbled together this coalition

169
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:47.020
that doesn't make a lot of sense. The coalition was the social conservative,

170
00:08:47.021 --> 00:08:48.370
traditionalist, religious. Right.

171
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.130
And they hated the atheism of the Soviet union.

172
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.850
You've got the libertarians, you know,

173
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.230
practical anarcho capitalists on one side, right.

174
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.660
They don't really care about the religious right argument at all,

175
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:02.850
but they hate the collectivism of the Soviet union.

176
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.920
You've got the blue dog Democrats.

177
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.020
They don't really care about either of those two things.

178
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.560
They care about the Imperial expansion of the Soviet union. They come together,

179
00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:11.460
they fight the cold war.

180
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.510
<v 2>I think Reagan fits in that he's more of like a California conservative,</v>

181
00:09:14.511 --> 00:09:16.850
that kind of shifted right in the midst of all that. Right. Yeah.

182
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.680
<v 0>Anybody who tells you they can analyze Ronald Reagan is</v>

183
00:09:21.681 --> 00:09:22.514
lying to you.

184
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.210
Ronald Reagan is one of the most enigmatic figures in American politics. I mean,

185
00:09:26.211 --> 00:09:29.210
this is a guy he liberalized abortion laws in California,

186
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.950
more than anybody before him.

187
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:35.390
And yet he becomes one of the most pro-life presidents in American history. Uh,

188
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.650
it's very, I mean, I,

189
00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:41.690
I know that bill Buckley had a major influence on bringing Ronald Reagan over to

190
00:09:41.691 --> 00:09:42.441
the right. I mean,

191
00:09:42.441 --> 00:09:45.920
I think there were a lot of people of his generation who said they got mugged by

192
00:09:45.921 --> 00:09:46.580
reality.

193
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.480
And I think that's how you go from a new deal Democrat into a Reaganite.

194
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:51.320
<v 2>Conservative.</v>

195
00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.620
