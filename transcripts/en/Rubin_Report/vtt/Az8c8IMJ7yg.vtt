1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.440
<v 0>No Republicans, generally Republicans have gotten weak.</v>

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.040
I'll give you an example. I said, they're weak. They're timid.

3
00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.860
They're spineless their visionless. I said that for a long time,

4
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.150
You know, we recently lost John Lewis.

5
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.390
I have nothing politically that I agree with John Lewis,

6
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.960
except that, and the first day in Atlanta,

7
00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:28.220
I got a call to my radio show from then mayor Maynard, Jackson.

8
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.710
But I got to know Joseph Lowery, the SCLC. They all come on my program.

9
00:00:33.711 --> 00:00:36.590
The mayor would come on my program, Hosea Williams,

10
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.970
when my favorite guest ever really close friend of Martin Luther King, Jr.

11
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.170
Uh, John Lewis, Andy young. And I don't think Andy liked me much,

12
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.910
but with all these guys,

13
00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:50.780
I knew when I got to know their story and it was one of great courage and

14
00:00:50.781 --> 00:00:55.040
conviction. And if you look at Selma to Montgomery,

15
00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:59.000
if you look at fire hoses and dogs, and I learned this lesson,

16
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.110
you see the peaceful protests of that time.

17
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.700
They help make this a more perfect union.

18
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.340
They put it all on the line. Here's an interesting side note to this, you know,

19
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.000
because we watched the eulogy with Obama. This, uh,

20
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.960
the eulogy Obama gave it at the John Lewis, uh,

21
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.890
remembrance and all the politics that he brought up,

22
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.470
which I found outrageous. It just.

23
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.690
<v 1>It was a political thing. It.</v>

24
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.250
<v 0>Was, it was awful.</v>

25
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.120
But he talked about the John Lewis extension of the voting rights act.

26
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.321
And I'm thinking, well,

27
00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:40.550
hang on a second because the guy that's leading your ticket, Joe Biden,

28
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.140
he ever corrupt, ever forgetful ever out of it. Joe Biden,

29
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.821
uh, well,

30
00:01:46.821 --> 00:01:51.560
Joe Biden says his mentor and his dear friend was

31
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.110
Robert Byrd. The former Klansman, by the way, Hillary said it, bill said it,

32
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.550
Schumer said it. Pelosi said it. So the TA, so,

33
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.320
so former president Obama was talking about these historic bills that John Lewis

34
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.430
absolutely along with so many others bravely fought for and made us a more

35
00:02:10.431 --> 00:02:14.480
perfect union. Not perfect. We still have a long way to go. But so,

36
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.940
and yet they're talking about act,

37
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.470
but the guy that's running actually supported the guy that

38
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.220
filibuster that historic legislation, people don't know.

39
00:02:25.221 --> 00:02:29.030
And this drives me nuts every two years, every four years,

40
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.710
what do they say about Republicans?

41
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.580
It's every election cycle Republicans are racist, sexist, misogynist,

42
00:02:34.581 --> 00:02:39.140
homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic. They want dirty air and water. Uh,

43
00:02:39.141 --> 00:02:42.170
Paul Ryan lookalike. It'll probably be a Donald Trump look alike.

44
00:02:42.171 --> 00:02:46.850
This year is going to take granny in a wheelchair after she's only eating dog or

45
00:02:46.851 --> 00:02:51.740
cat food for a year and throw her over the cliff and the wheelchair that's every

46
00:02:51.741 --> 00:02:56.510
two and four years. It is atrocious. I went through on Hannity this week,

47
00:02:56.511 --> 00:03:01.330
a history of how this happens every two and four. Well, the civil rights act,

48
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.250
Lyndon Johnson needed, and the voting rights act, 80% Republicans,

49
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.220
80% Republican than the house and Senate.

50
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.710
And then you have the mentor of their democratic presidential

51
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:18.340
candidate praising the guy that filibustered that bill. I mean,

52
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:22.780
that's madness to me, that's the guy that went integration was coming up,

53
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.350
talked about, uh, uh,

54
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.040
kids and integration of school as a racial jungle that he was

55
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:32.800
worried about what Donald Trump says.

56
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.220
<v 2>This is an actual quote. This is an actual quote.</v>

57
00:03:35.221 --> 00:03:37.680
So I think a lot of people are waking up to this.

58
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.500
And I think that's partly because suddenly, well,

59
00:03:40.501 --> 00:03:44.280
suddenly people can see the clips online where in the old days you couldn't

60
00:03:44.281 --> 00:03:45.570
really see the clips, right?

61
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.490
What do you think happened to the Republican's or to the GOP or to

62
00:03:50.491 --> 00:03:54.990
conservatives that let this thing get so confused that the

63
00:03:54.991 --> 00:03:59.280
reality of the history compared to the way it's portrayed,

64
00:03:59.281 --> 00:04:01.290
is that purely just immediate concoction?

65
00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:04.290
Or do the Republicans have some blame there themselves?

66
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.820
<v 0>No. Republicans, generally Republicans have gotten weak.</v>

67
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.140
I'll give you an example. I said they're weak. They're timid. They're spineless.

68
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.560
They're visionless. I said that for a long time. Uh,

69
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.340
when Republicans finally elected, well,

70
00:04:20.341 --> 00:04:24.150
we finally got a Republican president that would repeal and replace Obamacare.

71
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.900
Well,

72
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.160
where were the Republicans that voted 60 some odd times to repeal and replace?

73
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.210
They disappeared and they never even had an alternative in place.

74
00:04:33.211 --> 00:04:35.310
I had an alternative, you know,

75
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.760
either patient power or Cato Institute book by,

76
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.970
by Musgrave and Goodman that I read years ago,

77
00:04:41.971 --> 00:04:46.560
or a doctor that I often put on my show, uh, Dr. Josh Humber,

78
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.250
who, who created in Wichita, Kansas,

79
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.850
a healthcare cooperative totaling 50 bucks a month, 24,

80
00:04:53.851 --> 00:04:58.590
seven concierge care. He negotiates directly with pharmaceutical companies.

81
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.380
Guess what? 50 bucks a month for an adult,

82
00:05:01.381 --> 00:05:04.830
10 bucks a month for a child doctor available 24 seven.

83
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.610
You walk out with the medicines at a 90, 95% reduced rate.

84
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.040
You add that with a catastrophic plan.

85
00:05:11.041 --> 00:05:16.020
If God forbid you have a heart attack cancer or a bad accident,

86
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.540
they were all, they weren't ready.

87
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.540
And then the senators actually voted Republican.

88
00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:24.840
Senator seven of them voted for the exact same bill.

89
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.350
They had voted for two years that they voted on two years prior,

90
00:05:28.351 --> 00:05:32.160
just a straight repeal bill. Now, when it meant something,

91
00:05:32.161 --> 00:05:34.560
it didn't mean anything. So I'm angry at them for that. Now,

92
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.120
in terms of Republicans allowing this, this false narrative to go forward,

93
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.610
I do it every election year. Dave,

94
00:05:41.611 --> 00:05:46.530
I show the same clips is a 1998 Missouri radio

95
00:05:46.531 --> 00:05:50.370
ad. I went through this this week. If you elect Republicans, you know,

96
00:05:50.371 --> 00:05:54.780
across is going to burn or the James Byrd ad in 2000,

97
00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.530
that that says it's like my father was killed all over again because George Bush

98
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:03.590
didn't support hate crime legislation, uh,

99
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.180
with this horrific dragging death of this innocent man James Byrd.

100
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.660
But George W. Bush did support the death penalty.

101
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.910
So he wanted the guy dead, you know, for that crime, but that in humanity,

102
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.160
that evil and you know,

103
00:06:19.161 --> 00:06:23.150
or Al Gore goes before a predominantly African-American audience. And he's,

104
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.230
he changes his tone, his pitch, his cadence it's to me,

105
00:06:27.231 --> 00:06:30.510
it's like really tries to sound like he's a preacher in a,

106
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.900
in a predominantly African-American church.

107
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.410
Get another wrong agenda for African-Americans.

108
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.100
They don't even want to count you in the census or Hillary Clinton.

109
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:43.490
Same thing that prominent predominantly African-American audience.

110
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.810
I don't feel no ways tired. I mean, what is this?

111
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.880
<v 2>She's got hot sauce, Sean. She's got hot sauce in her bag. Don't forget that.</v>

112
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.230
<v 0>Oh, I do remember that. Yes, indeed. Indeed. Um,</v>

113
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.740
or they're going to put you all back in chains.

114
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.920
So this is the playbook.

115
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:08.140
I told everybody as I started the year and before I went on

116
00:07:08.141 --> 00:07:12.190
vacation at the end of the last year, it's coming, they will do it.

117
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.390
It's the playbook, dirty air, dirty water, racist, sexist, Masonic,

118
00:07:16.391 --> 00:07:19.930
and straight on through. So it frustrates me about Mitt Romney, Mitt Romney,

119
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:25.210
the very same people he's now embracing are the very same people that said he

120
00:07:25.211 --> 00:07:27.970
was a racist and a sexist misogynist.

121
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.280
So that's frustrating.

122
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.510
<v 2>The same people he was running. He had, he had binders full of women. They said,</v>

123
00:07:34.511 --> 00:07:37.300
he's a massage Eunice. Now, now he's the hero. So is that.

124
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.290
<v 0>By the way we're, women's women's resumes so we could hire them.</v>

125
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.910
Okay. Jeez, sorry. I have a resume.

126
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.080
<v 2>That doesn't make it into the tweets though. You know, Twitter it's short. So.</v>

127
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.060
<v 0>I wouldn't know I'm off Twitter, help Twitter prison.</v>

128
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.560
