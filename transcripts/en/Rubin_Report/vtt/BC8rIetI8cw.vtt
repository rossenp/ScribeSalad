1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.000
<v 0>Come on. They're going to lecture me about civility,</v>

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.200
but you have me on for a pretense, the book,

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.520
you don't ask me a single question about the book and you refuse to even mention

4
00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:15.150
my last name. I was like, you know, this is going wrong, real fast.

5
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.970
All right, here.

6
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.280
<v 1>There we go. This is the Rubin report. I'm still Dave Rubin.</v>

7
00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:26.150
And I have a feeling that YouTube may not be thrilled with this episode.

8
00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:30.230
So even more reason to subscribe and click that bell so that you actually get

9
00:00:30.231 --> 00:00:34.460
notified when the clips come out and joining me today is the VP of the Trump

10
00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:38.780
organization and the author of the new book triggered Donald Trump Jr.

11
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.230
Welcome to the room and report it to be with you, buddy. All right, here we go,

12
00:00:42.231 --> 00:00:43.064
man. I'm,

13
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.430
I'm 50 50 on whether this stream is going to be up by the time I finish this

14
00:00:46.431 --> 00:00:47.450
very sentence right now.

15
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.360
<v 0>It's sort of a win either way, right? I mean, if they sensor you,</v>

16
00:00:50.361 --> 00:00:53.450
we can blow it up and make it go everywhere. And then other people will watch,

17
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.360
but it's the same that we even have to have that conversation. Right.

18
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.280
<v 1>Sorta ridiculous. We're going to get to that.</v>

19
00:00:58.281 --> 00:01:01.130
And that actually has a lot to do with what you write about in the book here

20
00:01:01.131 --> 00:01:04.100
about all the tech, censorship and all that stuff. But before we do any of that,

21
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.780
uh, I don't know if you remember,

22
00:01:05.781 --> 00:01:09.920
but a couple of days you were on the view that you program on. No,

23
00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:11.870
one's mentioned that to me since. Yeah. Do you remember that?

24
00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:15.410
So there were so many things that happened in that interview that I was like,

25
00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:18.650
Holy cow, this is everything that I talk about all at once.

26
00:01:18.651 --> 00:01:22.460
So let's just try to hit a couple of things in a row here. So first off,

27
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.080
the way the interview started, where Whoopi, who I used to really like would be,

28
00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:28.880
I think she used to be a decent liberal,

29
00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:31.430
and now she's kind of gone off the progressive deep end.

30
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.460
She couldn't even say your name in the intro.

31
00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:36.710
She literally refused to say your name. What,

32
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.780
what does that feel like when you sit down and you know,

33
00:01:38.781 --> 00:01:42.110
you're in enemy territory and then the way they treat you before anything

34
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.890
happened?

35
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.130
<v 0>Well, listen, it obviously shows just how disingenuous,</v>

36
00:01:46.131 --> 00:01:47.780
the whole thing is first and foremost, right? I mean,

37
00:01:47.781 --> 00:01:52.430
they invite you on to talk about your book. Did you hear a question?

38
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.150
It'll a little one meeting three segments. I'm not a baby. Right?

39
00:01:56.151 --> 00:01:59.930
Like I get like, I'm going to get hit. I get that in that case, you know,

40
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.010
there's not even a conservative on my side,

41
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.200
given the history and you know, Abby Huntsman sort of what are like,

42
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.220
there's not a lot of personality there for that kind of stuff. So, you know,

43
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.390
I get it, I get that. I'm going into the lion's den, but like, come on,

44
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.940
they're going to lecture me about civility,

45
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.140
but you have me on for a pretense, the book,

46
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.430
you don't ask me a single question about the book and you refuse to even mention

47
00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:32.460
my last name. I was like, you know, this is going wrong real fast. But.

48
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.950
<v 1>Basically said that the son of the president, then she kind of choked out, uh,</v>

49
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:37.850
DJT.

50
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.120
<v 0>Don junior, I think, or Donald junior. She said like, she,</v>

51
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.940
she didn't say she never said Trump. You know, I'm like that. It's okay.

52
00:02:43.941 --> 00:02:46.550
I guess people know, but like, what's the PR what does it serve?

53
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.120
<v 1>But it does set a certain tone and that's been consistent. I mean,</v>

54
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.060
Ron Paul was on there a couple of weeks ago and the way they were treating him.

55
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.900
But then a few things happened in a row that I thought were pretty interesting.

56
00:02:56.901 --> 00:03:01.270
So you started getting hit and you apparently had done a little research because

57
00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:03.820
you turn the question around and said to joy, you know,

58
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:07.930
joy you've been in blackface and now joy has been in blackface.

59
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.730
She has admitted it on the view.

60
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:13.000
She immediately said she hasn't whoopee then said, well,

61
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:15.160
I'm a black woman and I know a black faces.

62
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.620
<v 0>And what B and you supported Roman Polanski at a rapist.</v>

63
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.790
So it's not rape rape. That's what she said, you know? Yeah, you're right.

64
00:03:23.791 --> 00:03:27.270
Sodomy of a 13, 14 year old girl, the under Quaalude. You're right.

65
00:03:27.271 --> 00:03:29.880
That's not rape will be like, if that's not rape, I don't know what he is.

66
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.030
And now you're seeing, by the way, like literally the day after, like it broke,

67
00:03:33.031 --> 00:03:36.030
like some other woman accused him of that one rape rape.

68
00:03:36.031 --> 00:03:38.580
Like I just want to make sure we're clear. Uh.

69
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.720
<v 1>You make of the idea that they never get these things turned on them.</v>

70
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.880
That that's what was so shocking to me. Nobody does it, even though we all know.

71
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.540
<v 0>Correct. And it was funny. Cause I see that, I mean, in the last couple of days,</v>

72
00:03:48.541 --> 00:03:51.060
just doing these book signings, like even these guys, you know,

73
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.490
we'll come to the books on a little bit. I love what you did on the view.

74
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.440
I'm like, what were you doing? Watching the beat? They're like a ball.

75
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.160
It was sort of funny, turn it around. But you know, I think what it is,

76
00:04:02.161 --> 00:04:04.950
honestly, Dave, so many people are used to going on. Those shows.

77
00:04:04.951 --> 00:04:06.870
They have big viewerships, they have big following.

78
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.650
They want to get invited back, you know, they're there to pitch something.

79
00:04:10.651 --> 00:04:13.680
And as was, I mean, I didn't just go on there for fun. Right. Uh, you know,

80
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.660
they're there to pitch something. So they're,

81
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.530
they're so desperate about wanting to be invited back that even though it was

82
00:04:19.531 --> 00:04:23.310
their five thousands episode, I don't think anyone's ever pushed back on them.

83
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.900
You know, they can sort of say it's, it's the view, not views, right.

84
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.540
There's one view. And if you don't have it, uh, you know,

85
00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:31.530
they're going to go in after you.

86
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.470
And so I guess I just sort of took their script on them and people are like,

87
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.860
well, how much did you prep for again, prep for that? I literally like,

88
00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:39.810
I was like, you know what, let me have something in my back pocket.

89
00:04:39.811 --> 00:04:42.540
If we can have a civil discourse. It's great. If we can talk about it and again,

90
00:04:42.541 --> 00:04:45.150
understanding that it was not your intention to flip it on. Know,

91
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.390
I that's why I sort of held off, but it was like, they went at me so hard.

92
00:04:48.391 --> 00:04:51.930
I figured, you know, Hey, if I'm on for three segments, okay, Hey,

93
00:04:51.931 --> 00:04:54.390
we'll talk a little bit and then they'll get rough. But like, you know,

94
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.460
just the opening salvo is just aggressive.

95
00:04:56.461 --> 00:05:00.300
Even the conservatives sort of come at you. So I was like, okay, like game on.

96
00:05:00.301 --> 00:05:03.630
Like I can play. I mean, so I didn't prep, but I went on Google for,

97
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.950
but I was like stupidest things I've ever said on the view like, Oh wow,

98
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.600
this was, this was not like a well-researched, you know, counter attack measure.

99
00:05:12.601 --> 00:05:13.560
But like, it was like,

100
00:05:13.561 --> 00:05:16.440
it was good to have something in my back pocket that shows a lot about

101
00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:17.130
hypocrisy.

102
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.080
<v 1>What does that tell you more broadly about the media though,</v>

103
00:05:19.081 --> 00:05:20.550
that they usually know?

104
00:05:20.551 --> 00:05:23.640
They can sort of say whatever they want and I don't mean just the view hosts,

105
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.510
but basically sort of all, all the lefty media can say whatever they want.

106
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.210
You guys just sort of take the hits usually.

107
00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:33.210
And then the media then we'll cover their tracks. After that.

108
00:05:33.211 --> 00:05:34.830
That's sort of the game that I think a lot of this.

109
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.030
<v 0>People won't even go because most people are afraid of the confrontation on, in,</v>

110
00:05:39.031 --> 00:05:42.180
on a live screen and stuff like that. They're well, you know,

111
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.360
they're concerned like me, the difference between me and so many people,

112
00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:49.110
like I don't care what the media says. I mean, some of the guys that I,

113
00:05:49.111 --> 00:05:51.630
you know, I spend a lot of time with now in politics and stuff. I mean,

114
00:05:51.631 --> 00:05:55.920
they've literally had the reporters call back, like, what is it with dungeon?

115
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.760
He just doesn't seem to mind when we attack. I'm like, I don't like,

116
00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:02.360
it means absolutely nothing. Do you think that's directly from your dad?

117
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.990
I guess it's just listen. I've been used to it. Uh,

118
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:08.870
I think there's a genetic component. You know, I sort of joke in the book.

119
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:09.710
I say, you know,

120
00:06:09.711 --> 00:06:12.980
it took us probably 41 years to realize that we were much more like each other

121
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:14.990
than you would've thought, you know, with my hobbies, the outdoors, the,

122
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:17.690
this like my, you know, sleeping on couches in the Midwest.

123
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.000
Like that's not his thing. He doesn't understand that.

124
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:24.620
And so I think if anyone would have asked us prior to sort of

125
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.050
the viciousness of politics, they would have been like, you know,

126
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.380
Dom's the one that probably least likely. And it was like, now it was like, Oh,

127
00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:32.930
well they kind of fight the same way you back us in a corner,

128
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:38.090
you attack us for three years, mercilessly, we fight. And uh,

129
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.940
you know, I guess that's the difference. It just doesn't bother me that much.

130
00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:44.750
So I don't, I don't really care what other people think of me.

131
00:06:44.751 --> 00:06:46.640
It's never been something that's phased me that much.

132
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.680
And so I'll get my part out and whatever they say, they say, I don't freak out.

133
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:54.380
If I get a bad press, I get bad press every day. Like they try to, you know,

134
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.430
anything I do and say can be used against me. I had, I mean,

135
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.050
this is relevant because it's literally today,

136
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.290
veteran's day in the book I wrote, uh,

137
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.200
there's a chapter about sort of the victory. And I say, you know,

138
00:07:06.201 --> 00:07:10.400
after two years of sort of that just fighting during the campaign, you know,

139
00:07:10.401 --> 00:07:13.700
when we won on election night, like I was not at all like, excited about it.

140
00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:16.130
It wasn't like, you know, we want a hockey game and it's like yesterday,

141
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.180
two hours of, and it was so vicious. So the,

142
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.120
the ups and downs, the ebbs and flows, they're so intensive. It,

143
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.820
it wears you down and beat you down. So when we won and they're like, we got it,

144
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:32.180
we I'm pacing around like a caged animal. Be like, no, no, no, they're good.

145
00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:35.090
They're going to do something. They're going to take what Hillary said,

146
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.980
Trump supporters were going to do what they're going to do. Exactly.

147
00:07:36.981 --> 00:07:38.180
That I turned out I was right, right.

148
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.780
Meaning they were going to try to get that they were going to protest in the

149
00:07:41.781 --> 00:07:44.180
streets. They were, that's what she's saying. Trump supporters are going to do.

150
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:46.550
Right. They're not going to accept the result a hundred percent.

151
00:07:46.551 --> 00:07:48.170
So I was there like, no, no, no.

152
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.870
Like I figured this game out now they're going to do something. So,

153
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.660
so when John Podesta got on stage and was like.

154
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.880
<v 1>Well, I was like, I was happier about that.</v>

155
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.640
<v 0>Even though it meant we were still fighting and it wasn't over.</v>

156
00:08:00.641 --> 00:08:03.190
And then I was that we had one,

157
00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:06.400
which is a pretty worked reality. But again.

158
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.920
<v 1>Was that night. What was that night like though when,</v>

159
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.360
cause Hillary didn't concede that night.

160
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.090
<v 0>Did you know? She did later on that night. Yeah.</v>

161
00:08:13.091 --> 00:08:15.070
It was sort of a wishy-washy concession. And then it was like,

162
00:08:15.071 --> 00:08:16.510
let's see if we can pull some recounts,

163
00:08:16.511 --> 00:08:20.690
turns out we actually got more votes than the recants. And, but, you know,

164
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:24.400
so I wasn't at all psych it, it didn't hit me yet. You know,

165
00:08:24.401 --> 00:08:25.480
what we had wanted accomplished.

166
00:08:25.481 --> 00:08:30.220
So I write a chapter in the book saying when it hit me was literally like two

167
00:08:30.221 --> 00:08:34.210
and a half months later. And it was rolling into Arlington. Um,

168
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:37.930
and you know, for the replaying ceremony. And I was like,

169
00:08:37.931 --> 00:08:39.730
I'm not an overly emotional kind of guy. Like I said,

170
00:08:39.731 --> 00:08:43.520
I can kind of compartmentalize the hate and just move on. But like duty it,

171
00:08:43.521 --> 00:08:44.560
it hit me pretty hard and it,

172
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:49.420
I were rolling into Arlington and you see the gravity of the responsibility that

173
00:08:49.421 --> 00:08:52.330
is, you know, what my father has to do right now. Like,

174
00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:56.580
and I was so happy then just the,

175
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.550
it all hit me then because he's the guy in charge.

176
00:08:59.551 --> 00:09:00.960
I know he's going to be such a good leader.

177
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:04.110
I know he's going to get out of these endless Wars and you're seeing it.

178
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.780
And like some guy I'm like, left-wing like try it's takes like some of it,

179
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.440
he compared his sacrifices. Like I said, they had everything,

180
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.720
all the BS that we've been going through a hundred percent worth it.

181
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.210
Cause he's the leader now that we need.

182
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.310
And they tried to make it seem as though, like,

183
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.940
I was obviously saying that my sacrifices as a business,

184
00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:24.990
as a person over a campaign was the same as the death of Americans.

185
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.850
Like I was like, honestly, I can't even engage because they'll try to build,

186
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:33.090
but like no reasonable person outside of like left wing and like vanity fair.

187
00:09:33.091 --> 00:09:36.990
And these like loser pubs that will try to take like anything you say and dunk

188
00:09:36.991 --> 00:09:37.231
on you.

189
00:09:37.231 --> 00:09:41.040
Like no reasonable human being of the thousands that have reached out to me that

190
00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:43.890
love the book. Not one has even thought men.

191
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.420
What they're saying I must have meant was what I meant.

192
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.940
I don't think any reasonable person was, but that's what they will do.

193
00:09:50.941 --> 00:09:54.060
And that's the sickness, uh, that is really out there in the media.

194
00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.620
<v 1>In a weird way though. Do you guys kind of need that now? Like it's,</v>

195
00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.770
you know what I mean? Like it's sort of become this self fulfilling prophecy.

196
00:10:00.771 --> 00:10:02.390
It's like the media is awful.

197
00:10:02.391 --> 00:10:06.420
Everyone watching this knows that they keep doubling down on lies and, and,

198
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:08.540
and racism and homophobia and all that nonsense.

199
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.410
<v 0>And we'll, we'll get to talking with you before we ever got into politics.</v>

200
00:10:12.411 --> 00:10:13.244
Right?

201
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.590
<v 1>Let let's just do that real quick. I was going to save it till later, but,</v>

202
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.650
but about eight years ago you did my Sirius XM show.

203
00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:22.550
It was on the out to gay channel. I didn't want to be on the gay channel,

204
00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:23.750
but they were like, you're gay. We're.

205
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:24.830
<v 0>Putting you up separately.</v>

206
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:29.090
<v 1>Okay. So I guess I did start somewhere, but, but it was separate but equal.</v>

207
00:10:29.091 --> 00:10:31.610
You know what I mean? You have an equal radio channel, but it's the gay channel.

208
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.560
But anyway, I got in touch with you.

209
00:10:33.561 --> 00:10:36.710
You came on the show and at this time again, eight years ago,

210
00:10:36.711 --> 00:10:39.260
you were for gay marriage. Your dad was not,

211
00:10:39.261 --> 00:10:41.120
this is way before he was running for president or anything.

212
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:45.050
And I asked you about that and I'm not going to, you can repeat what you said.

213
00:10:45.051 --> 00:10:45.884
Basically.

214
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.270
<v 0>I probably said something to the effect of, you know, what,</v>

215
00:10:50.271 --> 00:10:52.880
happy people are productive people. It doesn't bother me at all.

216
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.300
<v 1>If you're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations about politics,</v>
