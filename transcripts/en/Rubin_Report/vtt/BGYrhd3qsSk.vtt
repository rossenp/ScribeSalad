1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.410
<v 0>I know that I am not particularly predisposed towards metaphysical questions</v>

2
00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:06.540
because I don't think they can really be answered.

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.460
So the idea of what started the universe, uh,

4
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.880
we can't really answer that. I think that to say, God,

5
00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:17.940
that's just a placeholder for ignorance that doesn't help.

6
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.600
<v 1>I may have to get you in here with Prager to discuss it. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.970
<v 0>So where did God come from? It just,</v>

8
00:00:25.971 --> 00:00:28.850
it's just putting off that moment of ignorance a little bit further.

9
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.561
<v 1>Hey,</v>

10
00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:37.190
I'm Dave Rubin and unless I've been impeached by a completely partisan vote,

11
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.810
this is still the Rubin report, uh,

12
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.330
as always a quick reminder to click the subscribe bell.

13
00:00:41.331 --> 00:00:45.260
So you guys have a small chance of seeing our videos right here on the YouTube.

14
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.401
And more importantly,

15
00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:50.780
joining me today is an author political commentator and fellow at the Manhattan

16
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.750
Institute. Heather McDonald. Welcome back to the Rubin report. It's.

17
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.940
<v 0>Such an honor, Dave, thank you so much for having me on.</v>

18
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.810
<v 1>I'm glad to have you back had you on about a year ago and uh,</v>

19
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.790
the people they love you. That's what I learned.

20
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.190
That's what I learned in the YouTube comments, sections.

21
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.070
<v 0>Being in your presence. You know, it's,</v>

22
00:01:07.071 --> 00:01:09.380
there's so much love coming at you that they're a little spilled.

23
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.600
<v 1>All right, well then you're killing it in the scarf game today.</v>

24
00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:15.650
So I feel like I have to be very sharp. Brilliant. So here we go.

25
00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:18.890
So one of the things I wanted to start with here is something that we discussed

26
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.530
briefly about five or 10 minutes in our last interview.

27
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.960
You are a secular conservative.

28
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.240
And I think a lot of conservatives seem to think that that is an,

29
00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:34.100
either an oxymoron or just simply cannot exist because conservatism

30
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.150
has to have some sort of religious underpinnings.

31
00:01:37.151 --> 00:01:39.530
So I thought that would just be an interesting place for us to pick up the

32
00:01:39.531 --> 00:01:40.364
conversation.

33
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.330
<v 0>I based my conservatism on, on empirical truth,</v>

34
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.820
on what I've observed in life. Uh,

35
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.090
I can talk about the necessity of the two parent family,

36
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.980
because we can see empirically what happens when the marriage norm breaks down

37
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.990
in communities. Uh,

38
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.180
I support most traditional values because I think we have a history

39
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.900
of, of stability when those are honored.

40
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.330
I don't think it's particularly stable to rest a set of political

41
00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:16.190
principles or moral principles on the basis of revealed

42
00:02:16.191 --> 00:02:20.630
wisdom that this Holy book supports this. And I've,

43
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.810
I'll notice this people who I respect enormously, Dave,

44
00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:28.490
whether it's Dennis Prager or Michael Medved that are making the

45
00:02:28.491 --> 00:02:33.380
argument that you cannot have a moral society without

46
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.550
a foundation of religious belief, I would ask them,

47
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.510
these are two brilliant Jewish thinkers.

48
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.020
Why don't you believe that Jesus is the son of God.

49
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.030
It's revealed truth.

50
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.870
The new Testament says that this is gospel.

51
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.850
They don't believe that.

52
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.460
<v 1>Especially if you're going that far with religion. And you're saying,</v>

53
00:02:55.461 --> 00:02:58.760
you need this reveal of truth, this belief to organize a society.

54
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.500
Why not the next level of the reveal of truth or whatever the next level is or

55
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:02.910
something like.

56
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:03.480
<v 0>Right?</v>

57
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.190
They will not take it as simply necessary

58
00:03:08.191 --> 00:03:13.050
truth. The fact that the new Testament claims to be the word of God,

59
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.580
why don't they believe that they're basing their same belief in the old

60
00:03:17.581 --> 00:03:22.410
Testament on the same claim that the new Testament makes they just choose to be

61
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.980
agnostic or atheist about one of those Holy books,

62
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.660
I could apply the same challenge to their belief that the old

63
00:03:30.661 --> 00:03:35.130
Testament is the revealed truth, because it's simply a self,

64
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.800
uh self-validating.

65
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.600
So I would look for a different set of principles that are,

66
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.130
does not depend on one's suspension of disbelief and an

67
00:03:47.131 --> 00:03:50.850
acceptance that something is revealed truth for my moral code.

68
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.140
<v 1>So with that being said,</v>

69
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.340
does it matter to you if the end result is the same? Right?

70
00:03:56.341 --> 00:03:59.010
So I'm going to guess that on most of the important issues of the day,

71
00:03:59.011 --> 00:04:03.510
you probably agree in large part with both Dennis and Michael Medved

72
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.720
and most conservative thinkers that maybe come from a more religious background.

73
00:04:06.721 --> 00:04:09.410
So at the end of the day, when it all washes away, do you,

74
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.340
do you think it really matters? Do you think that's sort of a long-term problem?

75
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.180
<v 0>I know, I guess if we arrived at the same place, I think it's,</v>

76
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.220
it it's a problem for that segment of voters or,

77
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.810
or thinkers who don't find those appeals particularly interesting,

78
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.360
but I have to, I'll be very honest, Dave,

79
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.590
part of my resistance to this is simply

80
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.410
I don't find claims of petitionary prayer and the idea of a

81
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.310
personal, loving God consistent with what I see,

82
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.640
what I call the daily massacre of the innocence. To me,

83
00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:52.500
it's a very hard claim to make that I should expect God to pay

84
00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:57.390
attention to my wellbeing when he's willing to allow horrific things

85
00:04:57.391 --> 00:05:00.690
to happen to people far more deserving and innocent than I am. So for me,

86
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.610
it's partly just a truth value.

87
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.110
I cannot stomach what appears to me to be a patently

88
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.600
false claim about a personal loving God.

89
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.690
<v 1>It's interesting. I've mentioned that I've had, uh,</v>

90
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.470
John Casick in here who is the former governor of Ohio and a presidential

91
00:05:16.471 --> 00:05:19.110
candidate, obviously. And when I asked him about faith,

92
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.970
he said something that I, that sounded sort of, um, almost flipping, uh,

93
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.030
but I thought it was really actually pretty insightful. He said, you know,

94
00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:29.280
some people can do it with God. I just can't.

95
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.960
And I thought that was actually like, you know, for a certain set of people,

96
00:05:33.961 --> 00:05:34.794
they,

97
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.750
where you're able to sort of always sort of maybe go back to your intellectual

98
00:05:39.751 --> 00:05:42.600
side. Some people just sort of get tired of that does that.

99
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.380
<v 0>Well, I, and I also think it's a very, I think it's genetic.</v>

100
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.480
I know that I am not particularly predisposed towards metaphysical questions

101
00:05:51.481 --> 00:05:53.580
because I don't think they can really be answered.

102
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.520
So the idea of what started the universe, uh,

103
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.940
we can't really answer that. I think that to say, God,

104
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:05.000
that's just a placeholder for ignorance, right. That doesn't help.

105
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.570
<v 1>You know? Cause he may have to get you in here with Prager regress. Yeah.</v>

106
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.030
<v 0>Oh, so where did God come from? It just,</v>

107
00:06:13.031 --> 00:06:16.210
it's just putting off that moment of ignorance a little bit further.

108
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.720
So I don't find those questions particularly relevant. On the other hand,

109
00:06:19.721 --> 00:06:22.180
I recognize that for much of humanity,

110
00:06:22.181 --> 00:06:27.130
that is a very deep need to ask these basic

111
00:06:27.131 --> 00:06:31.360
questions about origin and an end point where we all headed.

112
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.530
What is the meaning of life to me, anybody who claims that they don't,

113
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.880
he doesn't find meaning in life when there is Mozart and heightened to

114
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.770
invoke a Dennis Prager favorite or Beethoven or John Milton or

115
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.490
escalas, or, or, or, or Anthony, Trollope.

116
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.640
<v 1>Just waking up with purpose for whatever you do doing.</v>

117
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:56.890
<v 0>To do the best you can do. I don't find life meaningless for one second.</v>

118
00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.210
Yeah. So does it worry you then.

119
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:04.120
<v 1>In Republicans or more broadly conservatives talk about God all the time or now</v>

120
00:07:04.121 --> 00:07:07.660
that we're seeing sort of a huge fracture in what's happening with the left,

121
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.900
they're like completely afraid to even mention God or anything like that.

122
00:07:10.901 --> 00:07:12.670
Bernie, I think is basically an atheist,

123
00:07:12.671 --> 00:07:15.670
although he won't really say it cause I think there would be political

124
00:07:15.671 --> 00:07:18.520
repercussions. Um, but are you like,

125
00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:22.060
does that make you sort of feel not totally at home with the conservatives?

126
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.640
<v 0>Well, you know, I,</v>

127
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.630
I grew up in a very secular environment and so it was a novel

128
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:33.310
discovery to me in the nineties when I was in a more conservative writing

129
00:07:33.311 --> 00:07:37.240
circle. And I grew up as a default liberal, uh,

130
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.960
I hadn't been exposed to religion. I mean, it is an amazing thing.

131
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:46.060
I had been educated on the coasts and I didn't realize

132
00:07:46.061 --> 00:07:50.470
how different they were. So in one sense, I'm very parochial.

133
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:55.660
Uh, and I hadn't been exposed to the degree of religious faith. Uh,

134
00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:57.580
I guess I find it.

135
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:03.700
I I'm always amazed what to me seems parochialism when I hear specially

136
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.790
Christians in a political environment,

137
00:08:06.791 --> 00:08:11.110
getting up there and talking about Jesus has God. My view immediately is, well,

138
00:08:11.111 --> 00:08:14.500
there are Jews around, you know, at the village and there are Muslims.

139
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.750
How can you be so confident that everybody in this audience is of

140
00:08:19.751 --> 00:08:22.240
that particular faith? Uh,

141
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:27.100
and I also would notice simply that religion has been

142
00:08:27.101 --> 00:08:28.930
tamed by the enlightenment.

143
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:33.160
It is now been taught to mind its manners and sit quietly in the corner.

144
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.290
We all, you know, the, the,

145
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:39.940
the great kissy WiSci between Jews and Christians that we all now talk about the

146
00:08:39.941 --> 00:08:43.990
Judeo-Christian environment, uh, heritage, heritage,

147
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.360
and perhaps rightly so that's.

148
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.000
<v 1>Right. It wasn't like that.</v>

149
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:53.350
There were things called the crusades at all by brothers though. Yeah, exactly.

150
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.400
Yeah. And all these religious supporters.

151
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:57.810
<v 0>You're saying we cannot live without it.</v>

152
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.610
They are conveniently overlooking what the history of religion has been

153
00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:07.440
in our tradition and still is in many other places that have not

154
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.780
gone through the enlightenment.

155
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:13.320
The concept of tolerance is not a religious concept.

156
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:17.910
It's an enlightenment concept and religion in the

157
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:22.290
West has been forced to accept tolerance,

158
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:23.790
which is a very good thing,

159
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.690
but that is not an idea that is inherent to religion. Right.

160
00:09:27.691 --> 00:09:31.860
So I don't want to be Prager or [inaudible] at the moment.

161
00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.520
<v 1>But I think what they would say is that it was the,</v>

162
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:38.990
it was all the religious stuff that organized society that allowed us to get to

163
00:09:38.991 --> 00:09:42.800
the enlightenment so that the enlightenment could then, you know,

164
00:09:42.801 --> 00:09:44.480
unfurl all these good ideas.

165
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.590
<v 0>Well, I don't think, I don't think Christianity or Judaism,</v>

166
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:53.000
Christianity has any necessary monopoly on moral virtues.

167
00:09:53.001 --> 00:09:55.850
I think there's a certain core sense of,

168
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.640
I don't know any culture that says murder is okay,

169
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.870
but every culture starts to make certain distinctions what they don't last that

170
00:10:02.871 --> 00:10:06.470
long, but it's fun for a moment, you know, you get to give it into your,

171
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.080
your most, uh, aggressive tendencies. Right?

172
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.290
<v 1>Where do you think, um, Trump falls out on this?</v>

173
00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.340
Cause I don't think anyone really thinks he's a religious person or perhaps even

174
00:10:16.341 --> 00:10:21.320
a believer in any real sense of it yet Christians or evangelicals,

175
00:10:21.321 --> 00:10:24.380
especially really seem to like the job that he's doing.

176
00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.850
<v 0>Well, I don't think he has particular principles or deep thoughts about much of</v>

177
00:10:28.851 --> 00:10:31.940
anything. I think he will. He's a chameleon.

178
00:10:31.941 --> 00:10:35.660
He takes on the coloring of what is convenient at the time.

179
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:40.700
So whether he believes or not, I, I, I, I don't know. He,

180
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:44.750
I don't think he's thought much deeply about it either. Uh,

181
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:49.430
and it doesn't really matter, but certainly he's willing to speak that rhetoric,

182
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.100
uh, in order to get, get that vote.

183
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.760
<v 1>If you're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations about politics,</v>
