1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.740
<v 0>We always talk about market failure,</v>

2
00:00:01.741 --> 00:00:06.330
but we never talk about government failure and you could check some of these

3
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:06.901
boxes,

4
00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:11.310
some of the horrific things that federal and state governments have done since

5
00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:15.420
the beginning of this pandemic to screw up the food supply to you.

6
00:00:15.421 --> 00:00:20.010
Remember this, this supposedly, uh, cache of, of, uh,

7
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.230
uh, N 95 masks, um, administration is going to have, well,

8
00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:26.340
guess what government fails.

9
00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:31.020
It always fails because politics is a horrible way to solve complex problems.

10
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:34.490
So when you combine those two things, if you're going to shut off the,

11
00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:39.090
the ingenuity of free people to solve problems and replace it with a

12
00:00:39.091 --> 00:00:43.410
central plan, that is by definition, going to be dysfunctional and wrong.

13
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.180
Um, that's where you get really, really bad things in our society.

14
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.480
<v 2>Having you on now is sort of the perfect time because if Liberty ever needed</v>

15
00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:06.410
a jolt or if it ever was about to have a resurgence,

16
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.560
I think both of those things are sort of possible right now.

17
00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:13.460
I sense that we need it more than ever, at least in modern times right now,

18
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.990
and that it could be on the cusp of really gaining momentum right now.

19
00:01:17.991 --> 00:01:22.520
So give me your basic breakdown of sort of where we're at with

20
00:01:22.521 --> 00:01:25.730
Corona, sort of what you thought we should have done. What,

21
00:01:25.731 --> 00:01:30.230
what was the appropriate Liberty minded response say two months ago in this

22
00:01:30.231 --> 00:01:33.650
first thing was, was rolling out to kind of where we are right now.

23
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.970
<v 0>So my, my initial reaction and I went back and checked.</v>

24
00:01:37.971 --> 00:01:42.080
The first piece I wrote about the pandemic was I think,

25
00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:44.720
March 16th. So it's a pretty early on.

26
00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:47.450
I actually wrote it on a beach in Joest van.

27
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.100
I was on vacation and we had to cancel it to get back to the United States

28
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.890
before I was afraid they were going to close the airports and,

29
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.650
and me being a geek, I, I wrote this piece,

30
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.990
but I was worried that that centralized top-down one size fits

31
00:02:02.991 --> 00:02:06.590
all solutions to very complex problems was,

32
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.390
was inevitably going to create a lot of unintended and destructive

33
00:02:11.391 --> 00:02:15.140
consequences. And I was thinking about one of my economist heroes,

34
00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:17.700
Frederick cost yachts, and, and he, he,

35
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.880
he talks about the seen and the unseen and the inability of people

36
00:02:22.881 --> 00:02:24.770
to conceive of the, uh,

37
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.000
incredibly complex division of labor that brings food to your table everyday.

38
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.780
You don't know how it happened. And, and you can see that playing out now,

39
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.680
people just assumed that food would show up. And so when,

40
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.390
when grocery store shelves are empty, they start panicking and they, frankly,

41
00:02:41.391 --> 00:02:42.470
they start blaming markets.

42
00:02:42.471 --> 00:02:46.880
When in fact it was meddling into the market process that created that.

43
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.280
And so my not, not even conceiving that we would do these massive,

44
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.180
never ending lockdowns, the way that the governors did.

45
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.620
I was worried that we're,

46
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.580
that the government was going to do all of things that would make it more

47
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:05.170
difficult to deal with, not just the disease and the virus,

48
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.850
but all the other things we need to do to keep our families safe.

49
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.290
And one of those things is earning income. Another is put food on the table.

50
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.390
A third is, is actually being able to take care of yourself and go outside,

51
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.840
uh, maybe get cancer treatments and all these things that,

52
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.130
that are now proving impossible to do. So I, knowing that government fails,

53
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:30.460
I was afraid that they were going to fail colossally bad,

54
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:31.840
and that's kind of where we're at.

55
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.720
<v 2>Okay. So I think most of my audience will be with you on the, okay.</v>

56
00:03:36.721 --> 00:03:40.530
We don't like the, the top down version of this.

57
00:03:40.531 --> 00:03:44.280
We want to figure out sort of local level individual stuff. First,

58
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.970
what I see a lot of people on Twitter saying is, Oh,

59
00:03:47.971 --> 00:03:51.360
this shows the flaw of libertarianism.

60
00:03:51.361 --> 00:03:55.110
This shows the flaw of small government because in a time like this,

61
00:03:55.111 --> 00:03:57.300
a pandemic knows no borders.

62
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.040
We need strong national decisions that are across the board and the rest of it.

63
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.450
How do you combat that?

64
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.870
<v 0>Well, I think, um, the entire purpose of the market process,</v>

65
00:04:09.871 --> 00:04:11.610
and I call it a mutual support system,

66
00:04:11.611 --> 00:04:16.590
the entire purpose of people getting together and cooperating and

67
00:04:16.591 --> 00:04:19.740
trading and engaging in ideas is,

68
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.000
is because we live in a radically uncertain world.

69
00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:27.390
What happened yesterday is in no way tells us what's going to happen tomorrow.

70
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.130
And the whole point for that process is for people to figure out really complex

71
00:04:32.131 --> 00:04:36.120
things that are going to happen to us. And it feels like this exoticness shock,

72
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.860
this natural disaster of a global pandemic is exactly what you want a

73
00:04:40.861 --> 00:04:44.670
decentralized system to solve and add top on that,

74
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.100
how much government officials don't know, we always talk about market failure,

75
00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:52.050
but we never talk about government failure.

76
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.290
And you could check some of these boxes,

77
00:04:55.291 --> 00:04:59.700
some of the horrific things that federal and state governments have done since

78
00:04:59.701 --> 00:05:03.810
the beginning of this pandemic to screw up the food supply to you.

79
00:05:03.811 --> 00:05:08.400
Remember this, this supposedly, uh, cache of, of, uh,

80
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.620
uh, N 95 masks, um, administration is going to have, well,

81
00:05:13.621 --> 00:05:14.730
guess what government fails.

82
00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:19.410
It always fails because politics is a horrible way to solve complex problems.

83
00:05:19.411 --> 00:05:22.910
So when you combine those two things, if you're going to shut off the,

84
00:05:22.911 --> 00:05:27.900
the ingenuity of free people to solve problems and replace it with a central

85
00:05:27.901 --> 00:05:32.670
plan, that is by definition, going to be dysfunctional and wrong. Um,

86
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.570
that's where you get really, really bad things in our society.

87
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.880
<v 2>Do you sense that a lot of the divide on the people that view the world</v>

88
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.520
top-down versus the people that view the world bottom up,

89
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.500
that it's just a fundamental psychological conditioning that they

90
00:05:49.501 --> 00:05:54.240
have, that it's not just, Oh, we learned we have different economic policies,

91
00:05:54.241 --> 00:05:58.820
let's say, but that their fear centers are, or, you know, I find when I,

92
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.710
when I hear all the big government people,

93
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.540
they S they seem to have this trust in a thing just because the thing

94
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:09.830
exists. So it's sort of inherently must be good because it existed,

95
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:13.790
or maybe 50 years ago it was better or something like that.

96
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.630
Versus I think people more in line with our thinking where it's like, well,

97
00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:21.050
just because it exists doesn't mean it's inherently good.

98
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.320
So I want to just scale the power back. Do you think that how much,

99
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.790
a certain amount of this is just your psychological makeup? You know.

100
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.960
<v 0>That, and, um, not to,</v>

101
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.910
not to sort of castigate my progressive friends, but, but I think,

102
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:38.260
um,

103
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.760
people don't appreciate just how much we don't know as

104
00:06:42.761 --> 00:06:46.720
individuals and how much our leaders don't know,

105
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.530
even though they went to all the right colleges and have all of these

106
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.990
Prudentials. And so maybe it's a, it,

107
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.490
there's a line in the sand about humility and being willing to say in

108
00:06:57.491 --> 00:06:58.810
public, uh,

109
00:06:58.811 --> 00:07:03.610
what is this new pandemic and how does it compare to past pandemics and what

110
00:07:03.611 --> 00:07:07.870
don't we know, um, if some of these modelers would have said, you know what,

111
00:07:07.871 --> 00:07:11.200
there's no way that I could model this in an honest way.

112
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.270
So let me tell you the things that we do know,

113
00:07:13.271 --> 00:07:16.450
but let me also tell you that if I project numbers,

114
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.480
there's no way it's going to be right. It's always going to be wrong. And,

115
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.810
and that sort of goes back to the old dream of,

116
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:28.120
of progressivism that you could take science and science was settled and really

117
00:07:28.121 --> 00:07:32.290
smart people that went to the right colleges could take that science and impose

118
00:07:32.291 --> 00:07:33.520
it on the rest of us.

119
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:38.080
And we would have this sort of rationally planned top-down society,

120
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:42.310
but that lacks humility. It lacks any sense that,

121
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:47.110
that you couldn't possibly know enough to plan a complex economy. And this was,

122
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.280
this was Frederick Hayek's entire critique of, of socialist planning.

123
00:07:51.281 --> 00:07:55.330
And I think it applies to, to any would be planner, even,

124
00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.590
even some of the, some of the governors and how they're they're,

125
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.050
they're telling us all in a very micro, cosmic way,

126
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.600
like you should do this and you shouldn't do that. Yeah.

127
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.060
<v 2>We talked about this a little bit when I was on your show a couple of weeks ago,</v>

128
00:08:07.061 --> 00:08:11.980
but do you think some of this sort of also is just the end of secularism

129
00:08:11.981 --> 00:08:14.290
in a weird way? It's the end of just, Oh,

130
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.730
people just creating systems in the moment that aren't necessarily experts and

131
00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:22.180
that the experts get everything wrong and that we just keep sort of outsourcing

132
00:08:22.181 --> 00:08:25.420
all of our decision-making and every day we wake up and as you're saying

133
00:08:25.421 --> 00:08:29.080
yesterday, doesn't, doesn't really, uh, form what tomorrow will be.

134
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:34.210
And that we've just sort of hit the end of what we can build in a

135
00:08:34.211 --> 00:08:35.710
weird way. Some, something like that.

136
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.580
<v 0>Yeah. Like there's, there's definitely been this, uh,</v>

137
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:43.630
democratization and decentralization disintermediation.

138
00:08:43.631 --> 00:08:45.100
My wife hates it when I use that word,

139
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:50.170
because it doesn't mean anything to anybody, but, um, technology has,

140
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.690
has democratized knowledge and information.

141
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.550
And I happened to be one of those guys that was super romantic about the

142
00:08:56.551 --> 00:09:01.440
potential to decentralize everything based on that. Um,

143
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.830
but it seems like there's a backlash now and,

144
00:09:03.831 --> 00:09:08.610
and you have clickbait and you have censorship and you have all of

145
00:09:08.611 --> 00:09:10.170
these things where sort of the,

146
00:09:10.171 --> 00:09:13.470
the empire striking back to get back to that phase.

147
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.750
I knew he to get there,

148
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.450
the experts do not like the fact that,

149
00:09:19.451 --> 00:09:23.820
that we probably don't need to go to school to, to figure out, uh,

150
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.140
electrical engineering.

151
00:09:25.141 --> 00:09:29.790
We probably don't need to defer to epidemiologists because we could

152
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:33.450
actually do some of that research for ourselves and discover that there is

153
00:09:33.451 --> 00:09:36.960
patterns and there is history and, and all that stuff is available to us.

154
00:09:36.961 --> 00:09:38.580
So I think in a lot of ways,

155
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.560
the backlash by the planners is because we were,

156
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:48.570
we were actually needing them less and they see an opportunity right

157
00:09:48.571 --> 00:09:52.350
now to reconsolidate power and take it back.

158
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.760
