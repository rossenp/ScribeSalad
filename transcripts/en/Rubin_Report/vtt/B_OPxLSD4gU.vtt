00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.400
<v 1>All right. People.</v>

2
00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:14.240
It is November 9th, 2020,

3
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.230
and I'm Dave Rubin. This is the Rubin report direct message.

4
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.020
There is a lot going on in the world right now,

5
00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:25.190
and we're going to hit as much of it that I think perhaps you need to know as

6
00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:28.910
possible, but again, not going to depress the around here.

7
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.360
I don't think I'm going to try not to depress you we'll see what happens. Uh,

8
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.691
okay.

9
00:00:32.691 --> 00:00:37.640
So first I want to talk just sort of broadly about the mental

10
00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:42.380
state of most people that, that I'm seeing at the moment. Um,

11
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.320
of course, I guess before I get to that specifically,

12
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.280
I should give you a mini update that has something to do with reality,

13
00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:51.020
as far as the election,

14
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.400
which is that the AP and some news outlets have called it,

15
00:00:55.401 --> 00:00:56.780
but the election results,

16
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.830
obviously aren't certified and that Trump is going to challenge things. Now,

17
00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:04.100
I think anyone, regardless of whether you wanted Trump to win,

18
00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:08.000
or you wanted Biden to win or whatever you wanted,

19
00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:12.320
Joe Jorgensen or Kanye West, I think that most people,

20
00:01:12.321 --> 00:01:16.370
most sane people in a democracy would say that they want, uh,

21
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.120
the election to feel that it was honest and real and everything else.

22
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.890
So if right now your position is that it was legit and it's good and we're

23
00:01:24.891 --> 00:01:28.880
good to go. Then you let Trump do his legal challenges and they won't work out.

24
00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:29.780
And everything's fine.

25
00:01:29.781 --> 00:01:34.460
So I think having everyone considering that,

26
00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:36.920
it sounds like about 74 million people,

27
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.140
assuming it's real voted for Biden and about 71 voted for Trump, this is,

28
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.220
this is a huge amount of people that voted Trump. If in fact,

29
00:01:46.221 --> 00:01:50.720
he lost got the second most votes all time only to Biden,

30
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.220
which all seems very bizarre.

31
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.690
But the point is that I think what's more important than who won specifically in

32
00:01:56.691 --> 00:01:59.660
a bizarre sense is that if we're to believe that this system works,

33
00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:02.510
then you have to let the system do what it does.

34
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.650
So Trump is allowed to challenge and courts to find out what's going on.

35
00:02:06.651 --> 00:02:10.490
And if things are within margins of error or they trigger recounts or all of

36
00:02:10.491 --> 00:02:14.660
that, then all of that process will happen. And if at the end he loses,

37
00:02:14.661 --> 00:02:17.600
he loses. And if, if something gets reversed, he gets reversed.

38
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.310
But I think everyone's popping the champagne on the left a little too quickly.

39
00:02:22.311 --> 00:02:26.300
And that they've sort of just jumped into this, I guess,

40
00:02:26.301 --> 00:02:27.560
this thing where it's like,

41
00:02:27.561 --> 00:02:29.690
we're already telling you who's in our administration,

42
00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:32.750
we're already telling you we're putting critical race theory back into,

43
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.980
into the government. I mean, all of these things that, that seem pretty bizarre,

44
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.700
uh,

45
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.350
to be just so quickly jumping in on top of the fact that this campaign staffer

46
00:02:42.351 --> 00:02:46.550
for Pete Buddha judge has started this ridiculous Trump accountability thing,

47
00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:49.940
where they're going to just start listing people who have anything to do with

48
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.390
the, with the campaign and with the administration. And it's like, that's,

49
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.340
that's actually the most anti American thing, you know,

50
00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:58.250
coming up with these lists so we can make sure what that these people don't have

51
00:02:58.251 --> 00:03:00.670
jobs in the, or that they can't get bank accounts,

52
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:03.520
or they can't be on social media. I mean, in a bizarre sense,

53
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:07.630
these people are actually everything that they purported Trump to be all these

54
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:08.464
years. Anyway.

55
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.870
So before I get into just sort of some personal stuff and what's going on right

56
00:03:12.871 --> 00:03:17.730
now, I just wanted to say that, that I am completely okay, Dave Rubin here,

57
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.170
I am completely okay with everyone doing whatever legal

58
00:03:22.171 --> 00:03:24.600
mechanism they have. And then at the end, yeah.

59
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.310
Once those things have been exhausted,

60
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.650
obviously we have a president it's as simple as that,

61
00:03:28.651 --> 00:03:32.880
but I think that there is a, a little bit of premature celebration here.

62
00:03:32.881 --> 00:03:37.340
Like we, you know, and, and, and by the way, I am hearing some sane, people say,

63
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.830
not, not too many people saying you are saying that, but,

64
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.780
but some people are out there. Um,

65
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.480
so before I get into some of the nitty gritty of what's happened in the last

66
00:03:45.481 --> 00:03:46.314
couple of days,

67
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.490
I wanted to talk about just sort of like the general state of being,

68
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.060
because I can tell you that, regardless of what happens here,

69
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.240
let's say Biden wins like my general state of being,

70
00:03:57.241 --> 00:03:59.070
although it would not have been my choice.

71
00:03:59.071 --> 00:04:02.700
And in many ways I'll have to fight harder, right?

72
00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:07.680
For the things that I believe in free speech and open inquiry and the American

73
00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:11.310
dream and capitalism and all that. Well, AI, I like fighting in some ways,

74
00:04:11.311 --> 00:04:15.720
I think I probably like being in an opposition more than in the power, right?

75
00:04:15.721 --> 00:04:17.460
Like I'm not, I'm not that concerned with power.

76
00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:21.360
I like fighting for what I believe in. And I'm actually okay with that. Um,

77
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.810
but what I've noticed is there's a lot of people that you can sense that their

78
00:04:24.811 --> 00:04:27.900
whole outlook on life just got completely flipped. And,

79
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.020
and I think that that's dangerous. It's dangerous for many reasons.

80
00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:34.920
And it's one of the reasons why you should never want a president that has so

81
00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:38.070
much power that your whole life outlook,

82
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.870
your whole existential being can be changed depending on who the

83
00:04:42.871 --> 00:04:43.704
president is.

84
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.060
So it's like these people who had been miserable and screaming and hysterical

85
00:04:48.061 --> 00:04:49.560
and Hitler and Nazis,

86
00:04:49.561 --> 00:04:52.470
they're coming for us and everything else for the last four years,

87
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.680
suddenly they're out in the park and they're dancing and they're celebrating

88
00:04:55.681 --> 00:04:56.130
everything else.

89
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.840
I just want to give you two personal examples of things that have happened to me

90
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.280
just over this past weekend. Now, again,

91
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.510
I'm not thrilled with the purported result at the moment,

92
00:05:06.511 --> 00:05:09.990
but I will accept democratically elected results. I'm not the King, right.

93
00:05:09.991 --> 00:05:13.920
So it is what it is. And as I said, Trump has every right to challenge. However,

94
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.880
he wants a challenge. Okay. Uh, I have, I'll tell you two things.

95
00:05:17.881 --> 00:05:22.530
So I have a friend goes back a long time, um,

96
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.550
and we've sort of lost touch over the last couple of years because he he's a

97
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.940
lefty. I am what I am, whatever you want to call that at this point.

98
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.440
And over the years when we've had,

99
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.710
we've had political debates for 20 plus years about all sorts of stuff,

100
00:05:34.711 --> 00:05:37.740
and it was never hostile. Like you could always just at the end, it was like,

101
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.700
all right, let's, let's have a beer, whatever. But during the Trump years,

102
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.060
when I tried to have these conversations with him, he would get extremely hot,

103
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.800
uh, angry. And, you know,

104
00:05:46.801 --> 00:05:50.100
I'm defending a bigot and all of this stuff to the point that at one,

105
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.540
we were at a,

106
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.710
we were at a bar in New York city and we were sitting there and he's really

107
00:05:55.711 --> 00:05:57.830
yelling at me and, and this craziness.

108
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.710
And I hadn't seen him for quite some time and he's getting very hostile.

109
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:04.220
And he had just had a kid and I wanted to talk about the kid and now his wife's

110
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:06.500
doing it, or he does, but he had to bring everything back to politics.

111
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.040
And it just wouldn't, I couldn't end it. I couldn't end it. And you know, me,

112
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:13.300
like, I will do everything I can to defray these situations. Right.

113
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:14.680
So I finally said to him,

114
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.930
do you think it's possible that I believe what I believe as much as

115
00:06:19.931 --> 00:06:23.290
you believe what you believe and he immediately, you said no,

116
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:24.820
like without even having to think about it,

117
00:06:24.821 --> 00:06:28.660
like I could not possibly believe the things that I'm saying he used.

118
00:06:28.661 --> 00:06:32.500
So earnest and honest and forthright. And I'm the reverse of that.

119
00:06:32.501 --> 00:06:35.590
And I know many of you have these types of examples where you get into debates

120
00:06:35.591 --> 00:06:36.381
with people and they,

121
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:40.570
they can't even begin to believe that you might believe these things. Anyway.

122
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.640
It CA it continued to escalate,

123
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.340
and I've actually never done this in my entire life before.

124
00:06:45.341 --> 00:06:48.400
And I hope I never have to do it again, but I just threw money down at the bar.

125
00:06:48.401 --> 00:06:51.040
We were sitting at the bar and I left. Um, anyway,

126
00:06:51.041 --> 00:06:53.050
we haven't really talked much in the last two years,

127
00:06:53.051 --> 00:06:56.110
but then on a Saturday night, uh,

128
00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.070
he texted me a picture of us from years ago. No,

129
00:06:59.071 --> 00:07:03.220
no comment just to just a picture. And I thought, this is,

130
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.900
this is so absolutely why the obsession with politics is making

131
00:07:07.901 --> 00:07:11.650
everyone crazy. So you believe that you got the result you wanted.

132
00:07:11.651 --> 00:07:15.190
So we haven't been able to talk for these last couple of years and whatever,

133
00:07:15.191 --> 00:07:16.960
and I'm this awful person and everything else.

134
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:18.280
But now that you've gone through a result,

135
00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:22.000
here's a little reminder that we're friends. We can be friends again.

136
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.680
We can be friends again,

137
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.770
and I'll have to figure out how I want to deal with that personally, in my own,

138
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.820
in my own life. And I do try to extend the olive branch as much as possible,

139
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:34.240
but I had that happen. And then yesterday, uh,

140
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.810
I was talking to another friend who has had major, you know,

141
00:07:37.811 --> 00:07:42.130
Trump derangement stuff and the world's ending and everything else. Um,

142
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.760
and we were talking on FaceTime actually. And he said to me in the middle of it,

143
00:07:45.761 --> 00:07:47.800
and we weren't really talking about politics. Like,

144
00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:51.130
so specifically we were talking a little bit about COVID and whatever else and

145
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:56.080
kind of about life. And he said to me, um, you know, you should smile more

146
00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.400
first off. I, I think people always say to me, when I'm talking,

147
00:08:00.401 --> 00:08:03.700
I look like I'm smiling. So I think I generally do smile a lot,

148
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.340
although I don't think whether you smile a lot or not,

149
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.490
it's necessarily indicative of anything else. You can smile. You know,

150
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.680
Joe Biden smiles. It's a little scary, you know what I mean?

151
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.870
So putting aside smiles specifically,

152
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.500
I thought it was really interesting because here's another friend who has had

153
00:08:17.501 --> 00:08:20.770
massive Trump derangement syndrome. The country is ending.

154
00:08:20.771 --> 00:08:22.930
The world is ending COVID is going to kill all of us,

155
00:08:22.931 --> 00:08:25.480
just all the stuff that you know about now,

156
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:29.320
they got the result that we wanted and they were telling me to smile more,

157
00:08:29.321 --> 00:08:34.120
even though I haven't seen them smile now in years, like it's this sort of, uh,

158
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:38.140
AC the tree of things where if your whole world is wrapped up in politics,

159
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.970
the same people who four years ago didn't want us to accept results are now

160
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.290
demanding. We accept results with no questions. Um, this,

161
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.470
this is dangerous and weird, and I don't like it.

162
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.630
And I just wanted to mention that up top,

163
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.410
because even though I talk about these political things,

164
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.680
that sort of feel separate from the human part,

165
00:08:58.681 --> 00:09:00.840
like I thought if I framed a little of this in the human part,

166
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:04.620
I thought that might be good. Anyway, let's go to some video here,

167
00:09:04.621 --> 00:09:06.630
because this is just incredible folks.

168
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:11.490
Biden announced the winner by the media. Again, it's not certified. Okay.

169
00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:14.640
That's fine. Um, and then it's just incredible,

170
00:09:14.641 --> 00:09:16.860
because remember when Trump was having all of these events,

171
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.640
because Biden didn't really have any events or campaign or anything still got 73

172
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.280
million votes. Incredible. Um, but when,

173
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.070
when Trump was having all of these events, these were super spreader events,

174
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.390
and you know, nobody's wearing masks and they're packing all these people in,

175
00:09:30.391 --> 00:09:33.630
and they're not social distancing and COVID is going to kill all of us. Well,

176
00:09:33.631 --> 00:09:37.680
let's look at some video of the last couple of days, what the people,

177
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:38.700
uh,

178
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.360
who have been telling us to stay locked down and not do anything in the world's

179
00:09:42.361 --> 00:09:44.670
coming to an end. Let's take a look at what they're up to now.

180
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:32.390
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

181
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:35.750
<v 1>Well, there, you got it, guys. We've solved.</v>

182
00:10:35.751 --> 00:10:38.540
COVID social distancing, not necessary anymore.

183
00:10:38.541 --> 00:10:40.910
You don't necessarily have to wear masks anymore.

184
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:45.080
You can win an election and then also burn down effigies of the guy that you

185
00:10:45.081 --> 00:10:48.020
just defeated. The, I saw a lot of tweets, something like this.

186
00:10:48.021 --> 00:10:52.850
We've we've gotten rid of the dictator elect we through

187
00:10:52.851 --> 00:10:57.470
elections. Uh, yeah, there's just,

188
00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.870
there's just so much hypocrisy all over the place.

189
00:10:59.871 --> 00:11:04.700
And these people have been doing this role endlessly and the mainstream media of

190
00:11:04.701 --> 00:11:07.520
course refuses to call them out. And they'll never call them out.

191
00:11:07.521 --> 00:11:08.690
We know that when,

192
00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.900
when there were black lives matter rallies with thousands of people,

193
00:11:11.901 --> 00:11:15.920
the media wouldn't say that had anything to do with spreading COVID.

194
00:11:15.921 --> 00:11:20.150
But if Trump had rallies, it was all about that. And the rest of it. Um,

195
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:24.530
I also want to talk a little bit about some of the hypocrisy related

196
00:11:24.531 --> 00:11:29.390
to, um, accept sort of this except the results. And we have to unify now,

197
00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:30.740
cause I'm here. We're hearing a lot about this,

198
00:11:30.741 --> 00:11:31.850
that we have to accept the results. Now,

199
00:11:31.851 --> 00:11:33.320
I already talked about that at some level.

200
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.950
It's like the same people who didn't accept the results for four years are now

201
00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.050
telling us to accept the results. Again,

202
00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.260
I say this within the framework of if they,

203
00:11:42.261 --> 00:11:45.320
if they do whatever they are going to do in terms of lawsuits and everything

204
00:11:45.321 --> 00:11:48.530
else, and we have a result and it feels right and everything then, okay,

205
00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:53.090
it is what it is. You don't always win all the elections. Okay. So be it. Um,

206
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.890
but these are the same people who for four years ran with a Russian collusion

207
00:11:56.891 --> 00:11:57.251
hoax,

208
00:11:57.251 --> 00:12:00.930
and then an impeachment and the rest of it that never accepted the legitimacy of

209
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.220
election. That if this, that actually in many cases,

210
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.680
we're trying to burn down the system the entire time.

211
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.560
Now they got what they wanted, so we have to accept it. Okay. That's fine.

212
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.310
And I, and I get the hypocrisy thing and Soviet, um, the,

213
00:12:12.311 --> 00:12:16.330
the part that's more interesting to me is this. Now we have to heal part.

214
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.990
Now we have to heal. Now let's try it the other way.

215
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.400
Cause we're hearing the heal thing out of,

216
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:25.690
out of Biden and all that Emirates now is the time to heal now is the time to

217
00:12:25.691 --> 00:12:27.460
bring the country together.

218
00:12:27.461 --> 00:12:31.030
We've apparently purged racism and all of these things. Now,

219
00:12:31.031 --> 00:12:32.680
that kind of sounds right. Right.

220
00:12:32.681 --> 00:12:35.830
Like I listened to Biden's speech and it sort of, if you're not really thinking,

221
00:12:35.831 --> 00:12:39.790
it does sort of sound right. And, and would we all like a healing of the nation?

222
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:40.900
Well, I can't say we would all like it,

223
00:12:40.901 --> 00:12:43.180
but would most people like a healing of the nation, meaning,

224
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:47.530
meaning that we weren't at each other's throats all the time that the tenor and

225
00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:51.460
the, and the tone was, was down a little bit. The flame was a little bit lower.

226
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.890
I think most people would like that, but,

227
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.280
but it's very bizarre coming from these people who for four years,

228
00:12:57.281 --> 00:12:59.410
they didn't have what they wanted. Right? So the red,

229
00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:01.660
so we were bigots and racists and everything else. Now,

230
00:13:01.661 --> 00:13:03.550
they believe they have what they wanted.

231
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:08.200
So now is the time to heal. But think about it this way.

232
00:13:08.201 --> 00:13:12.610
Let's pretend that the results had come in the other way. The, the, uh,

233
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:16.090
Trump had won again. When you say results, it's a little murky right now,

234
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.560
but let's just say Trump had won.

235
00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:22.180
Do you think any of these people would be saying now is the time to heal?

236
00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:25.330
Now is the time to reach out across the aisle? No,

237
00:13:25.331 --> 00:13:27.790
they would literally be screaming, burned down, but,

238
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:31.630
but not only screaming burned down, they would actually be burning it down.

239
00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:36.400
Let's not forget there's no riots right now. Well, that's not quite true.

240
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.850
There are Antifa and black lives matter riots in Portland and Seattle.

241
00:13:39.851 --> 00:13:42.550
And there were some in DC and in New York where they just generally want to

242
00:13:42.551 --> 00:13:46.780
destroy, you know, America, those are just, you know,

243
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.520
just the general those things,

244
00:13:48.521 --> 00:13:53.440
but there aren't mass riots of people not accepting the results or

245
00:13:53.441 --> 00:13:54.280
whatever it might be.

246
00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.270
There was no chance that Trump's supporters were going to be out there

247
00:13:58.271 --> 00:14:02.020
destroying businesses and attacking people in the rest of it. There,

248
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:05.830
there just wasn't and the mainstream media offered you up. 50,

249
00:14:05.831 --> 00:14:09.790
50 guys were boarding up everything. I mean, I'm here in Los Angeles.

250
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:13.480
Every freaking thing is still boarded up. It's like 50 50.

251
00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.290
If Trump wins, then we know they're going to do it. And Viden winds.

252
00:14:17.291 --> 00:14:19.840
We know they're going to do it. And it, and it just, isn't true.

253
00:14:19.841 --> 00:14:23.950
And I think what you're going to see is an incredible amount of gas lighting.

254
00:14:23.951 --> 00:14:25.330
I'm using the phrase properly,

255
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:28.510
a tremendous amount of gas lighting over the next couple of weeks,

256
00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:32.290
the same people who would have gladly destroyed everything.

257
00:14:32.291 --> 00:14:36.940
If they didn't get what they wanted. Well now basically make it seem like, Oh,

258
00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:41.730
they're, they're just so good. They're so good. And they're so right rest of it.

259
00:14:41.731 --> 00:14:45.630
So it's going to be a little bit messy. And as always, I will, I will try it.

260
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.630
They give it to you in, in some kind of honest way. Um,

261
00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:53.150
but let's talk about the COVID situation for a second because magically you're

262
00:14:53.151 --> 00:14:56.270
not going to believe this guy's Pfizer, uh,

263
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.060
last night or early this morning, uh,

264
00:14:59.061 --> 00:15:03.620
announced that they have a vaccine that is 90%

265
00:15:03.621 --> 00:15:06.410
effective in the first analysis. Just out of nowhere,

266
00:15:06.411 --> 00:15:10.220
we just got Biden a couple of days ago. And now Pfizer is saying this,

267
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.380
the world is a strange place. Uh,

268
00:15:12.381 --> 00:15:16.490
allow me to read a little bit about it for you, uh,

269
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:21.410
Pfizer and BioEnTech set in a joint statement that their preliminary

270
00:15:21.411 --> 00:15:25.580
findings have shown higher success rates than many had expected.

271
00:15:25.581 --> 00:15:29.360
People who receive two doses as part of the trial. So a 90%,

272
00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:34.280
fewer symptomatic cases of COVID-19 then participants who

273
00:15:34.281 --> 00:15:35.390
were given a placebo. Now,

274
00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.960
what I find interesting about that quote specifically is 90%,

275
00:15:38.961 --> 00:15:40.730
fewer symptomatic cases,

276
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:44.960
but we've also been told constantly to watch out for the asymptomatic cases.

277
00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:46.950
And in many cases we've been told you,

278
00:15:46.951 --> 00:15:50.780
you have to watch out for those more because you may be completely asymptomatic

279
00:15:50.781 --> 00:15:54.410
and getting other people sick. So when they're saying this 90% thing, well,

280
00:15:54.411 --> 00:15:55.161
I would want to know, well,

281
00:15:55.161 --> 00:15:57.620
how many people are asymptomatic and everything else, but without,

282
00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:02.510
without whittling down the numbers on this, it's just, it's just fairly obvious.

283
00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:06.290
I'm not a conspiracy theorist. I'm really not. Um,

284
00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.630
but I think you were allowed to not allowed.

285
00:16:08.631 --> 00:16:12.260
I think you should actually, um,

286
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:17.150
explore the different venues of when you get information.

287
00:16:17.151 --> 00:16:18.710
Why did I get this information now?

288
00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:21.830
How did I get the information who's sending me the information and everything

289
00:16:21.831 --> 00:16:26.480
else? So the timing seems a little bizarre. Uh, if it's real,

290
00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:30.290
I suppose it's fantastic. Um, but we shall see it.

291
00:16:30.291 --> 00:16:34.640
And I think this asymptomatic part is, is a little bit bizarre. Um,

292
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:35.511
but either way,

293
00:16:35.511 --> 00:16:38.420
I think what you're going to see is more and more people will be out and about.

294
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.600
Let's also remember that in New York city right now.

295
00:16:41.601 --> 00:16:46.310
So there's videos of literally thousands and thousands of people, uh,

296
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:48.230
in Brooklyn and in,

297
00:16:48.231 --> 00:16:51.770
in some of the other boroughs and they're out there and they're celebrating and

298
00:16:51.771 --> 00:16:55.160
they're dancing and they're playing music. These people who, again,

299
00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:58.400
five days ago, they thought that we were in the third, right?

300
00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.970
Uh they're now they're now thrilled about everything, but keep in mind,

301
00:17:01.971 --> 00:17:05.780
you cannot go to church or temple in New York city.

302
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.980
You can not go to church or temple in Los Angeles. So that means what,

303
00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:14.240
what DeBlasio is saying in New York city and Cuomo, who is just that,

304
00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.390
he's the only guy worse than Andrew Cuomo is his brother, Chris Cuomo.

305
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:20.690
That that's tough. And by the way, I really like their dad, Mario Cuomo,

306
00:17:20.691 --> 00:17:25.430
who was the governor of New York years ago, you know, 30 years ago.

307
00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.760
Um, but the idea here is, okay,

308
00:17:28.761 --> 00:17:31.790
you guys can be out in the park and you don't have to social distance and many

309
00:17:31.791 --> 00:17:34.970
people weren't wearing masks and you can celebrate. And it's all fine.

310
00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:37.220
And the media, won't say a word about it and everything else,

311
00:17:37.221 --> 00:17:41.450
and we're not going to arrest you, nothing like that. But if you go to church,

312
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.810
if you go to temple, if you try to open up your small store,

313
00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.780
if you try to open up your restaurant, well, now you're in trouble.

314
00:17:47.781 --> 00:17:52.110
And even in the last two, there were some videos going around of, of, you know,

315
00:17:52.111 --> 00:17:55.830
these middle management regulators, these, these little,

316
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.280
these little people who have far more in common with the Nazis actually than

317
00:17:59.281 --> 00:18:03.090
anyone else who just show up at these places of business and try to shut people

318
00:18:03.091 --> 00:18:06.090
down. And it, and this type of hypocrisy,

319
00:18:06.091 --> 00:18:07.590
this is what we're going to have to be on the,

320
00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:11.360
on the lookout for more than anything else. Um, and, and,

321
00:18:11.361 --> 00:18:12.740
and one other thing related to this,

322
00:18:12.741 --> 00:18:17.660
which is that I definitely think that no matter what happens going

323
00:18:17.661 --> 00:18:18.410
forward,

324
00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:22.740
that ability to communicate on social media is going to be deeply

325
00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:25.780
hampered, right? Like the, the,

326
00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.760
the simple fact is the only thing that was keeping big media,

327
00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.150
not from going completely all in on censorship and everything else is that there

328
00:18:32.151 --> 00:18:36.110
was some threat from the administration. Well, once that threat is gone,

329
00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:39.860
and now we already know the critical race theory of Biden as the president is

330
00:18:39.861 --> 00:18:41.180
going back into the system.

331
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:45.080
And what that means is that anyone who argues with these ideas will be labeled a

332
00:18:45.081 --> 00:18:48.260
racist. I mean, that's how grilling it. You have to admire that alien,

333
00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:53.030
like quality of the totality of these ideas. It's so insane. Um,

334
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.910
but why wouldn't what I would phrase it differently.

335
00:18:56.090 --> 00:19:00.710
Why would social media allow for this 70 million people who are going to be

336
00:19:00.711 --> 00:19:04.340
deemed racist by the political establishment, the media establishment,

337
00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:07.730
and big tech, why would it let them on these platforms?

338
00:19:07.731 --> 00:19:10.970
And then I think you can extrapolate a million questions beyond that.

339
00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:15.140
So I think that we are going to see all sorts of weird censorship and all sorts

340
00:19:15.141 --> 00:19:17.450
of weird stuff, which by the way, is why I always tell you guys,

341
00:19:17.451 --> 00:19:19.550
if you want to communicate with me directly, join us on,

342
00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:24.410
on Rubin report.com and we're troll free and we're bot free. And it's,

343
00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.340
and it's a gated community, a small community. It's not so small, but it's,

344
00:19:28.341 --> 00:19:32.480
it's our small community. And that's what I think the future of the area it is.

345
00:19:32.481 --> 00:19:37.370
I don't think it's these giant big tech platforms. I simply don't. Um, okay.

346
00:19:37.371 --> 00:19:40.280
But let's, let's move on to, uh, to the final story,

347
00:19:40.281 --> 00:19:42.920
because I've been talking about sort of this,

348
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:47.060
this hypocrisy related to, okay, let's,

349
00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:51.860
let's reach out across the, yeah. Now let's let's heal and all that. Well,

350
00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:53.840
that's what a lot of people are saying,

351
00:19:53.841 --> 00:19:56.450
but not Jennifer Rubin of the Washington post.

352
00:19:56.450 --> 00:20:00.710
And before I go further about Jennifer Rubin, same spelling,

353
00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.690
I want to be very clear about something.

354
00:20:02.691 --> 00:20:05.630
I've never been more clear about anything in my life.

355
00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:09.230
I have not related to Deanna Peruvian. I don't know Jennifer Rubin.

356
00:20:09.231 --> 00:20:11.710
I've never celebrated a holiday with Jennifer Rubin.

357
00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.120
I don't want to know her in any way.

358
00:20:14.121 --> 00:20:17.120
And it's very odd to me that she's part of this system.

359
00:20:17.121 --> 00:20:19.820
This is a person who says she's a conservative,

360
00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:24.980
but I don't know what conservative idea she holds nor has

361
00:20:24.981 --> 00:20:27.580
helped any conservative cause. But you know, they,

362
00:20:27.581 --> 00:20:31.550
they love her on the left's cause she says she's a conservative and destroys

363
00:20:31.551 --> 00:20:35.630
conservatism from within. This is sort of a little bit like the, the, uh,

364
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:38.660
project Lincoln guys or the Lincoln project guys, whatever the hell they are,

365
00:20:38.661 --> 00:20:42.350
just go away already people. Anyway, Jennifer Rubin was on MSNBC,

366
00:20:42.351 --> 00:20:44.960
that wonderful bastion of journalism, that,

367
00:20:44.961 --> 00:20:48.460
that fantastic place that's going to tell you as it is. Um,

368
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.930
and she had this to say about the future of

369
00:20:52.931 --> 00:20:55.930
conservatism and the future of the Republican party.

370
00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:59.430
<v 2>Um, it's not only that Trump has to lose,</v>

371
00:20:59.431 --> 00:21:02.580
but that all his enablers have to lose. They have to,

372
00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.690
we have to collectively in essence, burned down the Republican party. Um,

373
00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.020
we have to level them because if there are survivors,

374
00:21:10.021 --> 00:21:13.830
if there are people who weather this storm, they will do it again.

375
00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:18.030
They will take this as confirmation that, Hey, it just pays to ride the waves.

376
00:21:18.031 --> 00:21:22.890
Look at me, I've made it through. And so up and down the ticket, federal state,

377
00:21:22.891 --> 00:21:25.530
local offices, the country has to repudiate this.

378
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.890
It is not a normal administration. And when these people say, Oh,

379
00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.830
you can't criticize us, it will deter public service.

380
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:36.510
It will deter people who are liars, who are enablers, um,

381
00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.430
who are really bad people and make.

382
00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:40.110
<v 1>I,</v>

383
00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:45.150
Dave Rubin am not related to Jennifer

384
00:21:45.151 --> 00:21:49.980
Rubin. I want to be very clear about that. As a matter of fact,

385
00:21:49.981 --> 00:21:54.600
we will clip me saying this right now and I will share it across the internet

386
00:21:54.601 --> 00:21:57.930
for all the time. I Dave Rubin,

387
00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:02.910
I'm not related to Jennifer Rubin. Do you understand?

388
00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:06.600
Okay, let's unpack what Ms. Jennifer Rubin said there,

389
00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.210
cause there's so much to it. Uh, these people,

390
00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:13.080
these people are not fit for polite society.

391
00:22:13.081 --> 00:22:15.510
Now I don't even know what polite society is anymore,

392
00:22:15.511 --> 00:22:18.150
and I'm not even sure that I would want to be part of it at this point.

393
00:22:18.151 --> 00:22:22.710
But these people meaning people who believe different things that are people who

394
00:22:22.711 --> 00:22:26.400
vote a different way than her. They're not fit for polite society. Here's,

395
00:22:26.401 --> 00:22:27.900
here's just a spectacular quote.

396
00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:33.030
I think it's absolutely important that any institution of higher learning any

397
00:22:33.031 --> 00:22:37.320
news organization and or any entertainment organization that has a news outlet

398
00:22:37.321 --> 00:22:39.960
would hire these people. So what's she in effect?

399
00:22:39.961 --> 00:22:42.870
What she's saying is if you're on the right,

400
00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:47.310
if you're one of the 70 million people who voted for Donald Trump,

401
00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.380
cause she's not, you know, they're know they'll frame it as, Oh,

402
00:22:49.381 --> 00:22:51.780
we mean the people that work in the administration or something like that,

403
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:56.370
know what they mean is anyone who has had anything to do with this.

404
00:22:56.371 --> 00:22:59.580
If they can find a Facebook post that you said you went to a rally,

405
00:22:59.581 --> 00:23:02.700
or you voted for Trump or anything else we should remove you.

406
00:23:02.701 --> 00:23:05.520
And then you shouldn't, I guess, be allowed to work in a college.

407
00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:09.210
You shouldn't be able to work at an entertainment organization or a news

408
00:23:09.211 --> 00:23:12.050
organization. Now of course, the irony here is, and this is,

409
00:23:12.051 --> 00:23:13.360
this is the hypocrisy of,

410
00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:17.250
of these sort of never Trump conservatives is that she's making sure that she

411
00:23:17.251 --> 00:23:21.840
has a job, right? So she's, she's, they're they're lapdog. Um,

412
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:24.510
while at the same time, she thinks that we'll save her,

413
00:23:24.511 --> 00:23:26.750
but eventually it'll come for you to like, you're, you're,

414
00:23:26.751 --> 00:23:29.670
you're just a willful idiot. Um,

415
00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.430
but it's not just that Trump has to lose,

416
00:23:32.431 --> 00:23:36.930
but all his enablers have to lose. And, and the really deranged part,

417
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:40.920
if there are any people who weather this storm, they will do it again. Sorry.

418
00:23:40.921 --> 00:23:42.360
I want to jump to the sentence before that.

419
00:23:42.361 --> 00:23:46.640
We have to level them because if are survivors,

420
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:50.960
if there are people who weather this storm, they will do it again.

421
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:55.760
If there are survivors, I put we're healing ourselves guys.

422
00:23:55.761 --> 00:23:58.850
Aren't aren't we healing right now. Um, this is,

423
00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:01.130
this is such dangerous stuff.

424
00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:04.040
Now I get it that she's just sort of a media construct.

425
00:24:04.041 --> 00:24:05.990
And nobody really listens to her and you know,

426
00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:09.440
bought Twitter followers and bots lover and the media, whatever,

427
00:24:09.441 --> 00:24:13.850
because she's a, she's a deranged anti-Trump I get all that stuff.

428
00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.030
I get all that. But that level of language survivors,

429
00:24:17.031 --> 00:24:20.030
if there are any survivors saying were, they're trying right now,

430
00:24:20.031 --> 00:24:24.020
what they want you to think is that if you voted your conscience,

431
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:28.310
if you did something different than they wanted you to do that they have a right

432
00:24:28.311 --> 00:24:30.980
to destroy you. And what they're telling you is there's, I mean,

433
00:24:30.981 --> 00:24:33.230
think about it within just days within,

434
00:24:33.231 --> 00:24:36.350
just days of the result,

435
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:40.340
they're already saying we've got lists, we're going to destroy people.

436
00:24:40.341 --> 00:24:42.680
Won't be invited to polite society.

437
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.910
They're trying to fear to make you afraid of your own shadow.

438
00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:51.710
And you know what? I think there's nothing to fear, but fear itself.

439
00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.510
I really think so. I really think so.

440
00:24:53.511 --> 00:24:56.690
I have no doubt that there's a lot of people who would love to destroy me and

441
00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:58.310
they're are not particularly good people,

442
00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.370
but should I either live my life in fear of those people?

443
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:05.720
Or should I do what I think is right? And then see where the chips fall.

444
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:08.990
I think it's obvious for me, at least that I'm going to do the ladder,

445
00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:13.730
but all of that, they want you to feel fearful right now. They want you to say,

446
00:25:13.731 --> 00:25:18.380
you will never win again and go back crawl under that rock that you came from.

447
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:23.090
And to say that to 70 million people, 70 million people who are, who are proud,

448
00:25:23.091 --> 00:25:26.900
Americans who are not racist, uh, and who have a lot of guns by the way.

449
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:29.600
Probably not the best thing to say. So,

450
00:25:29.601 --> 00:25:33.530
so it is an odd situation because on one hand you've got a set of them saying,

451
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:38.270
we have to heal. We have to heal the nation. Right. And then on the other hand,

452
00:25:38.271 --> 00:25:41.180
you have this set that are saying, but we must destroy these people.

453
00:25:41.181 --> 00:25:45.950
And I'm not even sure which one of them is more disingenuous when they're,

454
00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:50.180
when they're saying it. It's, it's, uh, it's pretty wacky. Okay guys, uh,

455
00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:54.650
we are doing live DMS every day, this week. Uh, I am actually, uh,

456
00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.900
headed to Dallas. I'm going to be doing some stuff with the blaze.

457
00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:01.010
So one of RDMS, at least on Thursday will be live from, uh, the Dallas studios.

458
00:26:01.011 --> 00:26:04.400
I have not left Los Angeles since this freaking lockdown began.

459
00:26:04.401 --> 00:26:05.780
So I will get on a plane. I,

460
00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.660
I assume it's still the second you get peanuts anymore.

461
00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:11.540
Or I guess peanuts were taken out like 20 years ago for allergies,

462
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:16.220
but all of a soda, I guess he can episode. I dunno. Um, and, uh,

463
00:26:16.221 --> 00:26:18.860
and there'll be just a lot of stuff continuing to happen.

464
00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.410
So don't lose your head. Don't burn down the city.

465
00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:25.670
I know you won't and I think everything's going to be okay. We'll figure it out.

466
00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:29.660
Let's continue. And if you want to talk to me directly, join us@rubenreport.com.

467
00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.860
Have a great Monday, everybody.
