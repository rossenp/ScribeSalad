00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.653
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.220
<v 1>All right. People,</v>

3
00:00:28.221 --> 00:00:32.600
it is election night in America.

4
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.080
It's all happening. It's all happening.

5
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.800
I could probably end the live stream right there because it's all happening.

6
00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:43.790
Everyone take a deep breath. It's looking good.

7
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.310
It ain't over yet. But yes,

8
00:00:46.311 --> 00:00:50.330
there are a lot of people in full meltdown mode, uh, on the left.

9
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.530
There's a lot of people rejoicing on the right. It has not been called.

10
00:00:54.531 --> 00:00:58.670
Let's not get away. Get ahead of ourselves. Let's just talk it out.

11
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.180
But I think everybody watching this at least can take a deep breath.

12
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.840
The American experiment is going to continue. Uh,

13
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.600
I've had a really fun couple hours. There were,

14
00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:11.030
there were some nerves at the beginning of it. Uh,

15
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.440
but it's been a fun few hours.

16
00:01:12.441 --> 00:01:15.590
I was over at the daily wire studios and they're closing up shop.

17
00:01:15.591 --> 00:01:18.740
This is the last thing that they're doing here in Los Angeles.

18
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.590
They're leaving because of our lunatic, governor Gavin Newsome,

19
00:01:21.591 --> 00:01:24.710
who I've been talking about, uh, and they're heading out to Nashville.

20
00:01:24.711 --> 00:01:28.910
So I was with Ben and Michael Knowles and Jeremy boring and, uh,

21
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.850
Andrew Klavan and a couple other people were there. Uh,

22
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.670
Dennis Prager was there and a few others and I was with them.

23
00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:37.220
And then I just did some stuff on the blaze with Glenn back.

24
00:01:37.221 --> 00:01:39.440
And I may be jumping back over thereafter. Uh,

25
00:01:39.441 --> 00:01:44.210
but just talking to people who ideologically four years ago,

26
00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:45.290
I would have thought,

27
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.240
or by opponents four years ago on this very night of election

28
00:01:50.241 --> 00:01:52.580
night, I had voted for Gary Johnson.

29
00:01:52.581 --> 00:01:56.780
I still absolutely considered myself part of the left. Uh,

30
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.500
I hadn't even done the why I left the left video. Uh,

31
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.060
and right before I did that video,

32
00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:05.120
I did a video that has about a million views called, um,

33
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.170
the left is no longer liberal. Uh, so I was still one of those.

34
00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:13.970
I was fighting to save liberalism from the left and then I don't have to

35
00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:17.390
belabor the point, but I think you guys know a bit about my,

36
00:02:17.391 --> 00:02:21.650
my political evolution and my, uh, intellectual journey since then.

37
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.090
And, you know,

38
00:02:23.091 --> 00:02:27.920
because I've been honest about my awakening

39
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.650
because I've been honest about it.

40
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.460
There's a track record of the last couple of years of saying what I thought.

41
00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:38.690
And usually it was pretty ahead of the curve. So for all of these years,

42
00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:43.400
when all of these mainstream media people were calling everyone crazy

43
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.920
right-wingers and far right, and all right,

44
00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:50.720
just for expressing whatever different non woke opinion they had will.

45
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.700
I was one of the people calling it out.

46
00:02:52.701 --> 00:02:56.900
And the show that we do that I did in my other garage,

47
00:02:56.901 --> 00:03:00.310
that we now do from here became hub. It was, you know, the,

48
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:03.850
the intellectual dark web, which isn't that relevant anymore in a certain way,

49
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:04.900
for many reasons,

50
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.000
but it became a hub for a couple of years for free thinkers to kind of

51
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:11.650
come together and talk about these things.

52
00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:15.370
And most of the things that we were talking about related to cancel culture and

53
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:20.290
social justice and Marxism and the destruction of our institutions and all of

54
00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:20.850
these things, well,

55
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.820
these actually were the things that people ended up voting on tonight. That is,

56
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.230
that is fairly obvious. And, and putting aside Trump,

57
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.510
putting aside Biden for a moment tonight is an absolute

58
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.590
push back on the BS of the mainstream media.

59
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.580
Even if some sort of crazy thing happens now and Biden wins,

60
00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:44.500
which does not look like it's going to happen. Okay.

61
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:47.290
Trump is in a comfortable position. Let me just run through it real quick.

62
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.260
Right now he's leading in Texas. He's leading in Pennsylvania.

63
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.250
He's leading in Ohio. Arizona did looks like it's going to go blue.

64
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:55.720
I don't know that they've called that yet. Uh,

65
00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.310
Trump did get Florida and Virginia, which was called very early on.

66
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:04.540
It was very confusing because the numbers were showing Trump up by like 16

67
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:05.321
percentage points.

68
00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:09.100
And yet the way they were using the exit polls are extrapolating their numbers.

69
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.210
They a couple of the networks called Virginia very early for Biden. Well,

70
00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:13.721
now Trump,

71
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:17.500
from what I'm seeing here is up by a hundred thousand votes and we'll see what

72
00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:19.570
happens on that one. So this, this is all looking,

73
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.190
looking very good for Donald Trump. Um, but in essence,

74
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.450
if,

75
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.220
if you thought that you could call half the country

76
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:31.054
racist,

77
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.010
if you thought that you could tell us all that America is awful and

78
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.440
evil, and only you in this case,

79
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:41.170
Biden a man who's really done much,

80
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.510
pretty much nothing in 47 years only, you could suddenly do it.

81
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.370
You know what I mean? You didn't do it all that time,

82
00:04:47.371 --> 00:04:49.680
but now you would do it well,

83
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.190
that just didn't fool people on top of the dementia stuff.

84
00:04:53.191 --> 00:04:57.000
And on top of the fact that he was in many ways running against his own base,

85
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.500
I am the democratic party.

86
00:04:58.501 --> 00:05:01.860
That's what he said while he's saying I'm not for the green deal at a debate,

87
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.510
even though it's on his website, uh, for everyone to see, right? It's like,

88
00:05:06.511 --> 00:05:09.840
it's all just sitting there. So none of it made any sense,

89
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.170
the Biden by the Biden thing, when they do the autopsy on this thing,

90
00:05:13.171 --> 00:05:14.940
which by the way is going to happen very quickly.

91
00:05:14.941 --> 00:05:19.380
And it's going to be ferocious. It is going to be seriously,

92
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.130
seriously, ferocious and Biden is going to check out immediately.

93
00:05:23.131 --> 00:05:24.930
And I would bet within months,

94
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.810
they're going to announce that he has some sort of medical condition,

95
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.930
which is by the way, very unfortunate and sad. You know,

96
00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:33.780
we've all sort of made jokes about the flooding of words and all that stuff.

97
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.020
And in a weird way, it's like you can joke about that stuff.

98
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.890
And I would often tell you,

99
00:05:37.891 --> 00:05:40.260
I don't mean to be glib when I'm saying that he has dementia,

100
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.640
but everyone knew it. And the mainstream media wouldn't talk about it.

101
00:05:44.641 --> 00:05:47.190
So the scandal became the non scandal,

102
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.570
but it will be a scandal afterwards because now once he loses all of the

103
00:05:51.571 --> 00:05:53.910
handlers that have known about this,

104
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.040
everyone in the campaign that has known about this,

105
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.180
they're going to have to destroy each other so that it doesn't get aimed at

106
00:05:59.181 --> 00:06:03.740
them. Right. And everybody knew Hillary Clinton knew Barack Obama knew.

107
00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:08.180
They all knew. Don't pretend that we, that they don't know. Right.

108
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:11.060
You can't pretend that they don't know because you could see it in front of your

109
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:11.720
own eyes.

110
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.950
But part of what the mainstream media does with fake news and nonsensical polls

111
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:18.470
and all the pollsters now look like they were wrong. And even the,

112
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.940
the popular vote is going to be closer than anticipated. It's like,

113
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.700
you guys don't want us to see what we can see, but we're,

114
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.820
we're done playing that game. We're done playing that game.

115
00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:33.140
So even though we don't have a full results yet,

116
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.710
and it could still potentially be a long night and we're going to get some

117
00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:40.880
updates while I'm live. So hopefully we will have more to more to celebrate.

118
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.460
I've got some fancy tequila here and a nice big death star, uh,

119
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.140
ice cube. And, uh,

120
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.670
I hope you guys are drinking something or eating something good. And,

121
00:06:51.671 --> 00:06:55.820
and there is goodness here guys. And let me say one thing after I take the sip,

122
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.300
There's goodness. Here, look, I know a lot of you that watch,

123
00:07:02.301 --> 00:07:03.470
this are not Trump people,

124
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.670
or maybe you're begrudgingly Trump people or whatever that might be.

125
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.380
And by the way, I'm not, you know,

126
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.260
as someone that comes from a more libertarian perspective on things,

127
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.530
I don't find my salvation in the president. I think Trump happens.

128
00:07:15.531 --> 00:07:18.230
It happens to be a very unique character.

129
00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:21.890
And for some reason he happened to be the man we needed right now,

130
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.160
but that doesn't make him Jesus. Right. That, that, that,

131
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.810
that doesn't make him King. Um,

132
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.680
but what it did make him with something that was very important at this

133
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:35.600
particular juncture and stepping away from the political part of this, you know,

134
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.280
when I did my live stream this morning,

135
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.800
I was trying to show you guys that not everything is about

136
00:07:42.801 --> 00:07:45.710
politics. You know, that that's number one, not everything is about politics,

137
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:50.600
but also it's not now that Trump will just feel emboldened to do more, right.

138
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.780
Like to do more. He actually did some things as president.

139
00:07:53.781 --> 00:07:57.590
And that's also why the woke series and the left and the media really hated him

140
00:07:57.591 --> 00:08:02.300
because he was actually doing things. You not, you may not be a,

141
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:06.950
you know, standard conservative on all fronts like me.

142
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:11.990
Um, but as a conservative, from a conservative perspective perspective,

143
00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:16.880
he's done conservative things. So you have to respect him for saying, Hey,

144
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.040
I'm coming in as president, as a conservative, I'm going to,

145
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.270
I'm going to do that kind of stuff.

146
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.220
And obviously the country was okay with that.

147
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.980
One of the things that I'm very curious about,

148
00:08:24.981 --> 00:08:28.970
and I know a few of you have submitted some questions. We did a last second, uh,

149
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.810
Q and a in the Rubin report.com locals community. Uh,

150
00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:35.840
one of you guys asked about, um,

151
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.570
the Latino and black support for Trump. Now,

152
00:08:38.571 --> 00:08:40.130
I don't know that we have numbers in yet.

153
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:44.960
It does sound like the Latino vote in Florida. Uh,

154
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.621
and by the way,

155
00:08:45.621 --> 00:08:49.250
when you talk about the Latino vote or as the Volkster is call it the Latin X

156
00:08:49.251 --> 00:08:52.790
vote, even though no Latino person says Latin X, um,

157
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.980
it is a very diverse community of people that come all sorts of different

158
00:08:55.981 --> 00:08:58.050
countries. And that came here for all sorts of different reasons.

159
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:03.090
It sounds like Trump did extremely well with Cubans. Now.

160
00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:05.760
That's interesting because Cubans, they fled Cuba.

161
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:07.860
That means they fled socialism.

162
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.340
So they might know a little something about that. And they felt, Oh,

163
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:15.150
here we are living the American dream. Like this is a good thing.

164
00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:16.620
And we got to keep it going.

165
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.370
So we'll find out a little bit more about some of the racial breakdown and

166
00:09:20.371 --> 00:09:22.800
let's, you know, obviously I'm, I'm super interested.

167
00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:27.180
And I think everybody is to figure out what happened with the black vote. Um,

168
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:28.500
but I'm curious all of the,

169
00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:32.580
all of the little groups that the left

170
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.330
believes that they own because of their birthright,

171
00:09:36.331 --> 00:09:40.170
they think they own you because you're black. They think they own you.

172
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.980
Cause you're gay. They think yo they own you because you're a woman. I,

173
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.650
those groups let's let's track those numbers. That's,

174
00:09:46.651 --> 00:09:48.900
what's going to be interesting to me over the next couple of days,

175
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.290
but to get what I was to get back to what I was starting to say earlier,

176
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.330
the thing that's exciting me right now,

177
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:59.040
isn't necessarily that Trump can do anything politically.

178
00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.500
There'll be interesting things that happen politically.

179
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.200
Maybe the peace in the middle East stuff will keep happening. Right.

180
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.850
Maybe now as a second term president, without having to worry about re-election,

181
00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:12.240
he'll feel emboldened enough to really start pushing governors,

182
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:16.860
to open up con uh, open up States. Like that would be good at this point. Okay.

183
00:10:16.861 --> 00:10:19.740
That would be good at this point. So we have that,

184
00:10:19.741 --> 00:10:22.560
but that's not the part that really is interesting to me.

185
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:26.670
I think the part that's interesting to me right now is the thing that I think

186
00:10:26.671 --> 00:10:30.240
has happened to me, that the thing that has actually happened to me,

187
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:34.000
where once you start saying what you feel, and,

188
00:10:34.001 --> 00:10:36.810
and I think me supporting Trump over the last couple of weeks,

189
00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:39.660
especially in the last two weeks where I really went for it, right.

190
00:10:39.661 --> 00:10:44.460
I really went for it because I felt this was a battle between freedom and

191
00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:48.120
socialism in effect. Okay. And I really went for the last couple of weeks.

192
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:52.080
I have felt great. I have felt great and not only have I felt great,

193
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:56.090
I feel like I'm communicating in the clearest possible way that I have in,

194
00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:57.630
in all of the years that I've done this.

195
00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.320
I think you guys are responding to it in a new way. As I said this morning,

196
00:11:01.321 --> 00:11:03.360
it's caused some friend problems.

197
00:11:03.361 --> 00:11:07.950
It's caused some family problems and those are all real things.

198
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:12.900
But what I think a second term of Trump can do is

199
00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:16.410
break the ice. It can actually,

200
00:11:16.411 --> 00:11:19.320
it was causing a lot of cracks in the ice this first term,

201
00:11:19.321 --> 00:11:23.640
but now it's like enough of this enough of cancel culture,

202
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.990
enough of saying that half the people who now will have voted in the president

203
00:11:27.991 --> 00:11:32.460
twice a enough of saying that they're all racist and homophobic and

204
00:11:32.461 --> 00:11:33.300
backwards.

205
00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:37.800
And all of those things like let's start for those of us that are happy right

206
00:11:37.801 --> 00:11:41.220
now that are excited right now. It's like, let's use that excitement,

207
00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.250
not only to reopen the country, uh, but to,

208
00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:48.660
to maybe follow our dreams more than we have, uh,

209
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:51.930
whatever it is, but like, feel proud about America. Again,

210
00:11:51.931 --> 00:11:56.260
I think we can start back to that and have a true, um,

211
00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:01.270
a true elimination of these bad ideas that have crept in the ideas of

212
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:02.590
critical race theory.

213
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:06.430
And that we're going to remove do justice because of title IX and the rest of

214
00:12:06.431 --> 00:12:09.190
it. It's like, let's have a real pushback now, of course, as,

215
00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:11.260
as I'm saying this to you, right this moment,

216
00:12:11.261 --> 00:12:15.010
I know that it's starting to get very violent in DC and it's not as if these

217
00:12:15.011 --> 00:12:18.610
people are going to go away. So we could talk about that at, at a couple levels.

218
00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:19.913
<v 3>So first.</v>

219
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:26.100
<v 1>At the political level, again, this is assuming Trump wins,</v>

220
00:12:26.101 --> 00:12:30.120
which is that's where it seems at the moment, um, at the political level,

221
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.240
the left and the Democrats have to decide what they are now.

222
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:37.020
And I've been saying for a long time that, you know, the AOC Johan Omar thing.

223
00:12:37.021 --> 00:12:40.080
And by the way, AOC and Johan Omer, both got reelected.

224
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:43.530
So it's not like they're going away, unfortunately. Um,

225
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.290
but they have to now decide, because I've been saying for a while,

226
00:12:46.291 --> 00:12:47.940
they call themselves democratic socialists,

227
00:12:47.941 --> 00:12:50.550
but it's only a matter of time until they rip off the mask and say,

228
00:12:50.551 --> 00:12:54.390
they're socialists. And we all know that we all know that. And for some reason,

229
00:12:54.391 --> 00:12:54.661
again,

230
00:12:54.661 --> 00:12:57.780
mainstream media didn't want to touch it and want it to play footsie with them

231
00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.530
and pretend that they're so great and all of that stuff. But now it's here.

232
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.610
Like, and, and I don't defend AOC or Bernie or the rest of that often,

233
00:13:05.611 --> 00:13:08.280
but I will say this a couple months ago,

234
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:12.510
it was AOC who said that Joe Biden and I shouldn't be in the same party. Well,

235
00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.960
a you're right. A Biden should just be retired already,

236
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:19.680
but you're right in that, if that he was the last vestige of an old,

237
00:13:19.681 --> 00:13:20.550
decent Democrat,

238
00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.280
even if he was totally corrupt and didn't know what he thought at this point and

239
00:13:23.281 --> 00:13:27.480
everything else, they were smuggling in the really radical stuff with him.

240
00:13:27.481 --> 00:13:31.270
I think most people, most thinking people kind of accept this at this point,

241
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:35.760
but that, that was true. And that's what this election is a repudiation of. So,

242
00:13:35.761 --> 00:13:40.500
so the Democrats now have to have their

243
00:13:40.501 --> 00:13:44.940
internal battle. They have to have their war. And if, if, uh,

244
00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:47.370
Biden had one, they weren't going to have their war.

245
00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:52.140
They would have just slowly started growing and they would have eliminated all

246
00:13:52.141 --> 00:13:55.500
of whatever might be left of the moderate old school Democrat.

247
00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.150
Now there were many left they would have,

248
00:13:57.151 --> 00:14:01.170
but it would have all just sort of melted away. Now the war is here.

249
00:14:01.171 --> 00:14:05.070
The socialists can rip off the mask, Bernie, or start a third party.

250
00:14:05.071 --> 00:14:06.360
Like maybe that's what they have to do. Okay.

251
00:14:06.361 --> 00:14:07.680
We're going to actually start a third party. Now.

252
00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:09.690
I don't think they'll do that because they don't want to work. I mean,

253
00:14:09.691 --> 00:14:10.524
that's the other thing, these guys,

254
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.480
these are not people that really want to work and build.

255
00:14:12.481 --> 00:14:14.340
They want to destroy things. That's what they're good at.

256
00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:19.530
So I think this could cause the implosion of the democratic party altogether.

257
00:14:19.531 --> 00:14:24.500
And maybe that's just good. And then the question would be, and,

258
00:14:24.501 --> 00:14:26.970
and my liberal friends who will still talk to me,

259
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:31.470
if you still consider yourself an old school liberal, it is now your job to say,

260
00:14:31.471 --> 00:14:35.670
wow, you radical. Nutbag left these, you see what you left us with?

261
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:40.140
You left us not with one term of Donald Trump, but two terms of Donald Trump.

262
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:44.100
Okay. So we got to now have that fight. We got to have that fight.

263
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.640
I don't see how the liberals and the decent moderate Dems,

264
00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.280
if there are any left at this point, I don't see how they win that.

265
00:14:50.281 --> 00:14:53.450
So either they split into two parties or there's just the destruction of the

266
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.510
democratic democratic party or whatever else, but all right,

267
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.660
let's enough talking about the losers. Let's talk about the winners here.

268
00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:01.850
Trump has an incredible opportunity.

269
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.600
Trump has an absolutely incredible opportunity. You take the conservative,

270
00:15:05.601 --> 00:15:09.500
you take the libertarians, they take the classical liberals. You take anyone,

271
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:14.000
you basically take anyone who likes the experiment of America and you make them

272
00:15:14.001 --> 00:15:18.470
feel good about it again. And you now, Trump now what's your chance, man.

273
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:22.730
Your chance is to, is to open that freaking economy, get us back to work,

274
00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:27.650
get us watching sports again, the, the woke thing.

275
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.200
Think about the hand that it just took,

276
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.420
despite we're going to have violence right now,

277
00:15:32.421 --> 00:15:34.760
and it's going to feel like there's still a lot of energy there,

278
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:39.260
but in terms of, in terms of reality, who, who will be governing us,

279
00:15:39.261 --> 00:15:42.980
what ideas, one, it's not those ideas.

280
00:15:42.981 --> 00:15:46.550
And all they've got is lashing out. All they've got is lashing out. Okay?

281
00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.250
So we're going to see plenty of it. And, and, uh,

282
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.790
and hopefully it doesn't last very long. And you know, I had judge Jeanine,

283
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.650
Pirro judge Jeanine, Pirro on, um, what was it about month and a half ago or so?

284
00:15:57.651 --> 00:16:02.360
And we talked about what Trump would do if he won and the violence didn't stop.

285
00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:06.860
Meaning if the mayor of Portland and Seattle and New York, uh,

286
00:16:06.861 --> 00:16:11.450
DC, if these mayors will not do anything to stop the violence.

287
00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.160
Well then what does the president do? Well,

288
00:16:13.161 --> 00:16:17.570
the president does have the ability to use the insurrection act and then have

289
00:16:17.571 --> 00:16:21.200
troops in these cities. Now that's not good. Nobody wants that.

290
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.530
But if we are to end this thing, then it needs to be ended.

291
00:16:24.531 --> 00:16:28.070
And Antifa is a domestic terrorist organization. And it has,

292
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:32.420
it has tied itself in with a huge amount of black lives matter

293
00:16:32.421 --> 00:16:35.000
supporters who are openly Marxist.

294
00:16:35.001 --> 00:16:39.050
And they have huge inroads with the progressive political establishment,

295
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.260
the Bernie AOC, Ilhan Omar's and the rest of them. So,

296
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.560
so Trump is going to have some serious decisions to make are what are we going

297
00:16:45.561 --> 00:16:48.610
to do about this unrest? I think most people,

298
00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:53.440
most people want to get a reset. Now I've been saying it for a while.

299
00:16:53.441 --> 00:16:57.070
We can't go back. We're not going back to pre COVID times.

300
00:16:57.071 --> 00:17:01.510
Like the world is fundamentally different right now, but this Trump win.

301
00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:05.890
It's a pushback on big tech. It's a pushback on mainstream media.

302
00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:10.000
Like all of you, people who have consistently gotten everything wrong,

303
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:14.170
you did it. And again, you got it wrong again, and you losers.

304
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.520
And now I'm going to do a little,

305
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.940
this will be a little bit of a Pat and myself on my, on my own back.

306
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:23.980
You losers at the Lincoln project. Like you,

307
00:17:23.981 --> 00:17:28.630
people who clearly can't maintain an erection so that you then decide

308
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:33.640
that you have to spend your life just being against one thing. This orange man,

309
00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.130
it's like, you guys got to go away now, but the thing is,

310
00:17:36.131 --> 00:17:38.200
we're not going to put you on lists. You know, there were,

311
00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.980
I did a couple of videos in the last two weeks about lefties, like on the left,

312
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:47.080
these like Robert Reich, who was, uh, in the Obama administration, uh, you know,

313
00:17:47.081 --> 00:17:50.340
talking about how we're going to have to have truth and commissions.

314
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:54.690
And Chris Hayes that little dork on MSNBC, he was saying the same thing.

315
00:17:54.691 --> 00:17:54.871
You know,

316
00:17:54.871 --> 00:17:57.720
we have to have these commissions and we have to find out what happened in name

317
00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:01.280
names, and get lists of people. Guess what? Trump and the right.

318
00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.530
We're not going to do that. We're not going to do that.

319
00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:07.100
But that doesn't mean we don't. I can't mock you guys and,

320
00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:09.350
or at least ignore you guys,

321
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.080
like all of you people who've gotten everything wrong. Bill crystal.

322
00:18:12.081 --> 00:18:14.360
You've gotten everything wrong, David from you've got everything wrong.

323
00:18:14.361 --> 00:18:17.690
You guys gotta go away now. Like we're not going to come and get you.

324
00:18:17.691 --> 00:18:19.820
We're not going to try to destroy you. We're not going to show up at your house.

325
00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.410
You were sending you to the Gulag.

326
00:18:21.411 --> 00:18:24.320
A lot of the stuff that the lefties would love to do with all of us,

327
00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.350
but all of these people who just got everything wrong,

328
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.950
who have refused to see the world as it is. And, and,

329
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:33.860
and could only see the world as they wanted it to be. It's like, no.

330
00:18:33.861 --> 00:18:37.700
And the pollsters, the pollsters, you guys got everything wrong. How is it?

331
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:41.780
I am one guy. I sit here. My producer, Michael is in the room.

332
00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.840
It's a small room. It's about, I don't know, 12 feet by 12 feet.

333
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:49.480
I got my dog at my feet. I got the Michael here. And we,

334
00:18:49.481 --> 00:18:53.750
we write out a couple things and then I do this show. And for some reason, this,

335
00:18:53.751 --> 00:18:57.320
what I've been able to do makes a lot more sense to a lot more people than the

336
00:18:57.321 --> 00:18:59.660
nonsense that's coming out of mainstream media.

337
00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.600
Because I didn't listen to the polls. I listened to actual people.

338
00:19:02.601 --> 00:19:06.620
I went on the ground and I talked to people at the Beverly Hills, Trump rally.

339
00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:10.070
And I looked at my email and I saw all of these emails.

340
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.790
All of these people saying, I'm a lifelong Democrat. I'm now a Trump supporter.

341
00:19:13.791 --> 00:19:17.180
Or I'm an independent, I'm now a Trump supporter. And a lot of them even say,

342
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:19.190
I don't even love Trump, but I'm a Trump supporter.

343
00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:22.840
I've just had it with these freaks. But nobody, nobody in me,

344
00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.390
the media wanted to deal with this. Honestly, you know what they did instead,

345
00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:29.210
the New York times ran a piece about YouTube, burrs,

346
00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:33.590
driving people to the alt-right and they had my picture on it on a cover story.

347
00:19:33.591 --> 00:19:34.440
Okay. You,

348
00:19:34.441 --> 00:19:37.940
you guys know about all of the hit pieces and the way they tried to destroy

349
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:38.781
Jordan Peterson,

350
00:19:38.781 --> 00:19:43.190
who was only trying to teach people to clean their room. I mean,

351
00:19:43.191 --> 00:19:45.350
have a little bit of personal responsibility.

352
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:47.900
Will those are the ideas that are winning right now.

353
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:51.860
Like the right ideas just got a boost tonight, guys. Let's,

354
00:19:51.861 --> 00:19:55.280
let's run with that. And let's, let's, uh, let's really look at it. So,

355
00:19:55.281 --> 00:19:57.890
you know what? Let's pull up the, uh, let's pull up the map, you know, I'm,

356
00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:00.080
I'm doing a lot of talking here and we didn't look at the map.

357
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.240
People loved the map, they loved the red, they loved the blue.

358
00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.840
So the main thing that you need to know right now is as you're looking at this

359
00:20:05.841 --> 00:20:09.320
map, and I think this is as updated as we've got at the moment,

360
00:20:09.321 --> 00:20:13.610
California did go blue. I got my work to do here. Uh,

361
00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.970
but as I said earlier, Texas is now strongly leaning towards Trump,

362
00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:21.080
as well as Pennsylvania and Ohio. So those were, those were three big ones.

363
00:20:21.081 --> 00:20:23.750
Those are the big boys here. Uh, he did get Florida,

364
00:20:23.751 --> 00:20:25.460
which obviously was crucial as well.

365
00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.760
Arizona is looking like it's going to go to Biden and this Virginia thing,

366
00:20:28.761 --> 00:20:31.760
unless anything's changed in the last 10 minutes or so, uh,

367
00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:34.970
Virginia Trump was up by a hundred thousand after they had declared it for

368
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.460
Biden. So there's a little confusion as to what's going on there.

369
00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:42.590
I don't know that we have an update on that. Um, but guys, look, this is,

370
00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:47.680
this is good news. Like, and, and how can I do this? Cause I, you know,

371
00:20:47.681 --> 00:20:50.290
I want, I want those of you,

372
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:55.000
even though I can be silly and I can be glib and whatever it's like, I want,

373
00:20:55.001 --> 00:20:57.310
if you're really worried about the country right now,

374
00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.260
because you were a Biden supporter,

375
00:20:59.261 --> 00:21:01.390
like you really thought Biden was the answer,

376
00:21:01.391 --> 00:21:05.890
or you really hate Trump or something and you still watch this. I promise you,

377
00:21:05.891 --> 00:21:10.300
I will try in the next couple of weeks. It won't be easy at times,

378
00:21:10.301 --> 00:21:14.350
but I will do my best to build some bridges in that direction,

379
00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:19.030
because what will be really interesting is as the left has that

380
00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:23.650
internal war, that civil war that they have to have. Well, as I said,

381
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:27.280
we got a big tent on the right now, but somebody's got to build that bridge.

382
00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:30.520
So maybe that's what my role in this could be. And you know,

383
00:21:30.521 --> 00:21:34.090
I was on Alan Dershowitz, Alan Dershowitz, his podcast this morning,

384
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:38.650
and he's a lifelong liberal who then defended Trump in his, uh,

385
00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:42.040
in the impeachment hearings. And then it has been destroyed, you know,

386
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:44.860
relentlessly attacked by the left and doesn't get invited to parties and the

387
00:21:44.861 --> 00:21:46.180
rest of it anymore. And which,

388
00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:51.040
what we talked about is that we have a similar view of liberalism,

389
00:21:51.041 --> 00:21:54.280
let's say, but he wants to still fight it from the left.

390
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.710
And I just don't think that works anymore. I want to fight it from the right,

391
00:21:56.711 --> 00:21:58.520
but we agreed to kind of disagree on that. And,

392
00:21:58.521 --> 00:22:02.650
and I think both of those are worthy, worthy causes, worth taking.

393
00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:06.580
So I hope that, you know, my, my friends or,

394
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.170
or whoever's left,

395
00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:12.080
let's say out of the IDW crew that really got this thing wrong and,

396
00:22:12.081 --> 00:22:16.270
and really suffers from Trump derangement syndrome and everything else. Uh,

397
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:20.620
maybe, maybe we should talk some of this stuff out. Maybe we should maybe,

398
00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:23.950
maybe there was something going on here that you had a blind spot too.

399
00:22:23.951 --> 00:22:27.160
And maybe I can be a little bit of the bridge doesn't mean,

400
00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:30.100
doesn't mean you've got to put the freaking hat on.

401
00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.290
It doesn't mean you got to put the precon hat on,

402
00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:35.680
but you might also realize that the hat doesn't mean that you're a white

403
00:22:35.681 --> 00:22:39.040
supremacist and the hat doesn't mean that you're a racist and a big and the rest

404
00:22:39.041 --> 00:22:43.900
of it. So that's what I think is interesting right now. Um,

405
00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:47.350
you know, I think we're probably gonna wrap this because I want,

406
00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:50.230
I'm sure you guys, you probably have, you know, some,

407
00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:54.220
some other map on another screen and there's so much happening at once. And, uh,

408
00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:57.130
and I want to get back to some of it too. So, uh,

409
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:59.080
jump on the Rubin report community.

410
00:22:59.081 --> 00:23:01.480
That's where I'll be doing most of my communication with you guys.

411
00:23:01.481 --> 00:23:03.520
And that's where I can go back and forth with you. Of course,

412
00:23:03.521 --> 00:23:04.990
I'm also on Twitter and everything else,

413
00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:08.640
but just if you were a Trump person and he wanted this to happen,

414
00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:12.220
just feel good right now know that, especially if you did it publicly,

415
00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.610
because I know just in the last couple of weeks, this was not easy.

416
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.750
This truly was not easy for me, the stresses. And you know, I know it,

417
00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:22.480
maybe it looks easy or it's like, well, what do you have to lose Dave?

418
00:23:22.481 --> 00:23:25.230
Or you run your own business or anything else? I, you know, I'm, uh,

419
00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:29.100
I'm in a pretty, uh, I'm in a pretty blue city in a pretty yeah,

420
00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:33.000
blue state and it doesn't, it doesn't come with nothing. Uh,

421
00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:36.900
it comes with some costs and, uh, and I'm thrilled right now.

422
00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:41.910
I am genuinely thrilled. I am hopeful for the future of America. Um,

423
00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.920
we avoided what could have been something really bad. And I said this morning,

424
00:23:45.921 --> 00:23:50.120
I think Trump will represent a saving of liberalism as well as

425
00:23:50.121 --> 00:23:54.260
conservatism. And in 2024, you're going to get such a cool, interesting,

426
00:23:54.261 --> 00:23:56.840
diverse crop of Republicans.

427
00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:00.350
And then maybe the real reset of the country can happen.

428
00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:04.160
So we're going to probably have four kind of crazy years here, right?

429
00:24:04.161 --> 00:24:07.500
Like it's not like, you know, they called him Hitler the whole time.

430
00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:11.140
And I said it four years ago, guys, the day after the election, I said,

431
00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.440
find the video that I did.

432
00:24:12.441 --> 00:24:15.920
I'm sitting in my backyard at my old house because we were building the studio

433
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:18.110
and I said, look, I didn't vote for Trump.

434
00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.820
But if you guys don't stop calling him Hitler,

435
00:24:19.821 --> 00:24:23.920
it's not what you're doing to him. It's what you're doing to yourself. And,

436
00:24:23.921 --> 00:24:26.660
and this is what they've done. They've given themselves no room,

437
00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:30.980
no room to look back because they were fighting Hitler and that's bad. Um,

438
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:32.420
all right. I'm being told,

439
00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:37.400
I'm being told people that Texas good old Texas just went for

440
00:24:37.401 --> 00:24:41.450
Trump. The Alamo will remain. They ain't going to tear the Alamo down. Uh,

441
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:46.340
that is good news. So good things still continue to happen. Hopefully we have a,

442
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:48.650
I suspect we're not going to get a concession out of bite.

443
00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:51.320
And because from what I understand, but I can go to sleep at five 30.

444
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.480
So I don't think we're gonna get the concession at him tonight,

445
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:57.660
but I'm guessing Trump will be up and probably will be declared a winner or,

446
00:24:57.661 --> 00:25:00.470
or we'll declare himself the winner. And then we'll have to clean it up. Uh,

447
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.990
I will be up very early guys.

448
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:08.060
I got a 5:00 AM wake up on my alarm because I will be on Fox and friends at 5:45

449
00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:10.880
AM. I assumed dissecting some of this stuff we haven't discussed yet.

450
00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:13.070
That's 5:45 AM Pacific time,

451
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:18.800
which is 8:45 AM Eastern time. It's going to be an exciting night. But again,

452
00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:23.960
if you're excited and you're feeling good right now, feel it like, feel it,

453
00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:28.640
know it, be proud of it. It's awesome. It's good. It's real.

454
00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.310
And if you voted, you have something to do with it.

455
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:34.910
And if you're nervous right now, if you're nervous, if you're upset,

456
00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:38.990
if you're angry, well, then I suppose you could do one of two things.

457
00:25:38.991 --> 00:25:41.600
Either take that mirror and look at it and go, well,

458
00:25:41.601 --> 00:25:46.190
what did we do wrong here that led to this, do that?

459
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:48.980
Or maybe go, Hmm,

460
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:51.260
maybe those guys are doing something right.

461
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:53.420
And maybe you have to do a combination of those, right?

462
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:54.650
Maybe you have to do both of them.

463
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:57.920
And that's what a political evolution is all about. Uh,

464
00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:59.120
but I'm thrilled that I've,

465
00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.760
I've been part of this adventure for all of you guys. Um,

466
00:26:01.761 --> 00:26:05.360
I'm excited for what comes next. I'll see you in the morning and we'll,

467
00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:08.720
and then of course we'll be doing our live stream at 11:00 AM Pacific tomorrow,

468
00:26:08.721 --> 00:26:12.740
which is 2:00 PM Eastern. And, uh, it's going to be a wacky week.

469
00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:16.700
Just stay safe, everybody, and God bless America. And I'm thrilled.

470
00:26:16.701 --> 00:26:19.550
And thank you guys for watching and that's it. All right.

471
00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:23.050
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>
