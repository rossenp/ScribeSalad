1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>This is an accusation that people throw at you,</v>

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.070
and then it's your responsibility to issue an apology for something

3
00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:12.420
you never even encountered in your life. And then to defend yourself.

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.260
And even we got a lot of messages saying, well,

5
00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:20.190
now you should donate money to any of the black lives matter causes.

6
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.520
And that to me is it's extortion.

7
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.290
<v 1>Hey, I'm Dave Rubin and it's small business week here on the Rubin report.</v>

8
00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:41.270
Joining me today is Anna [inaudible] co owner of cuchara restaurant

9
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.880
in Houston, Texas. Anna, welcome to the show.

10
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.430
<v 0>I thank you. Thank you for having me.</v>

11
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.490
<v 1>Yeah, my pleasure. I'm glad to have you,</v>

12
00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:52.520
because I want it to have someone in the restaurant business,

13
00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:57.380
because I think you guys are dealing with some seriously unique problems.

14
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.210
Uh, so first off, just tell us a little bit about why you started cuchara.

15
00:01:02.211 --> 00:01:03.890
How long have you guys been in business,

16
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.030
and then you've done some super interesting things during lockdown to stay

17
00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:10.550
successful. Uh, so I want to get into that as well.

18
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.230
<v 0>Perfect. Well, uh, the restaurant is going to be eight years old, the September,</v>

19
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.640
uh, the concept behind it is every time I go to Mexico,

20
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.290
I craved my grandmother's food. My aunt's food. I don't pray, but chef, uh,

21
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.570
so that's a concept.

22
00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:30.470
We have all female staff in the kitchen and they're all moms from Mexico.

23
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.660
They all cook from all right.

24
00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:35.930
They have so much passion and they care for fresh ingredients.

25
00:01:35.931 --> 00:01:39.860
And they're crazy for that. So basically they arrive,

26
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.550
they cook traditional recipes without any lists, and then they go home.

27
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.990
That's the principle. That's how I always wanted to be a,

28
00:01:47.991 --> 00:01:52.520
an all female kitchen to bring really the flavors of

29
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.980
the Mexican food that I grew up with. So that's how it'll start there. Um,

30
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.580
our anniversary is September 15, which is Mexico's independence,

31
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.660
very not known for many Americans, but that is Mexican independence,

32
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.350
September 15. So if, uh, we,

33
00:02:09.351 --> 00:02:12.230
then we're going to have a big celebration this year. Again,

34
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.030
hopefully all these, uh, COVID thing will be gone by then. Um,

35
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.950
and basically the concept for the restaurant besides fresh food and e-mails is

36
00:02:21.951 --> 00:02:26.030
to also bring culture like Mexican celebrations to Houston,

37
00:02:26.031 --> 00:02:30.380
so people can understand and see what Mexico truly is about. Um,

38
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.420
during that COVID-19 of course we were forced to close our dining room and

39
00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:36.254
patio.

40
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.370
So we started because people know that we do lots of different events and lots

41
00:02:40.371 --> 00:02:44.060
of different parties. We kind of wanted to bring those to the home.

42
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.920
So we did classes online to play Loteria and prepare folktales or to

43
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.820
make the malice along with one of my books. Um,

44
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.720
we did a lot of different little events for regulars,

45
00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.120
where we created like an ID on. So it was private just for them.

46
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.610
Uh, we also need a YouTube channel.

47
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:07.000
So we posted the tamales class or some other little things.

48
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.780
We try to keep people engaged because, um,

49
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.740
we are in the middle of a very international, eclectic neighborhood.

50
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.270
And we have a lot of clients and majority the ones that support those day by

51
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:20.380
day, they're single.

52
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.370
They come to the restaurant because they met new people from all over the world,

53
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:25.150
new friends,

54
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.470
and they felt that solely of not being able to come to us as what they would

55
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.280
usually do. So we tried to stay in touch with them via Facebook,

56
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.020
or doing little events with them and creating different

57
00:03:38.021 --> 00:03:42.550
packages for them to pick up and learn how to make rice boating or a size with a

58
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.600
mortar.

59
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.430
We did lots of little events so that people felt engaged and they could

60
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:52.330
see the other regulars. At least if it wasn't a pool.

61
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.910
<v 1>So you started as a restaurant tour and you became a YouTuber in the midst of</v>

62
00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:58.710
coronavirus.

63
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.530
<v 0>No, I didn't really want it, but we had to.</v>

64
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.010
<v 1>And how has business been through making some of these changes?</v>

65
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.110
<v 0>You know, it was really challenging, but it worked. I mean, we,</v>

66
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:11.880
we cannot complain.

67
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.920
Our sales were not as terrible as we thought they would be in our minds.

68
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.900
We never wanted anyone to have to be for low or for them to have

69
00:04:21.901 --> 00:04:25.860
to go get unemployment. We just really wanted to keep everyone in, in our staff.

70
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.080
We love everyone in our staff.

71
00:04:28.081 --> 00:04:32.790
We have 52 employees and I just didn't want to be suffering.

72
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.560
We'd been organized. Uh, so we, we didn't have to worry about it.

73
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.390
We were able to do payroll even before the current account.

74
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.340
So everyone was grateful and thankful and happy to have a doc,

75
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.870
even though it was just a very few weeks, very few hours per week,

76
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.160
compared to the long hours where it used to. But you know, it worked fine.

77
00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.820
As I said, the sales were not that disappointing.

78
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.010
And once we were allowed to reopen, then we started going up again.

79
00:05:05.011 --> 00:05:08.610
So I would say it affected those,

80
00:05:08.611 --> 00:05:13.320
but not as bad as we thought or as other fellow restaurateurs have

81
00:05:13.321 --> 00:05:14.154
suffered.

82
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.490
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

83
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.940
Are you worried as a small business owner that even though you guys survived

84
00:05:17.941 --> 00:05:21.390
this one and you did some, some cool, fun things to make it through that,

85
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.691
you know,

86
00:05:21.691 --> 00:05:24.540
we could get a second wave where there could just be some other thing that,

87
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.050
that kind of puts you out again and you know, like all small business owners,

88
00:05:28.051 --> 00:05:31.860
you don't have a giant corporation that can kind of keep you afloat in these

89
00:05:31.861 --> 00:05:32.694
rough times.

90
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.480
<v 0>Correct? Yeah. We're scared about, you know,</v>

91
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.380
the CD deciding to close this again. Uh,

92
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.580
right now we're dealing with a lot of problems because of the social distancing.

93
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.450
Uh, some people tell you one thing, some people tell you another,

94
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.410
there's really not a very good communication system with the government,

95
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.040
with the rules and regulations follow, um,

96
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.900
which led to like another big problem we have, um,

97
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.330
they want us to keep six feet distance abled, which we've done.

98
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.900
So even if we're supposed to be open at seven 10,

99
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.200
it doesn't work for us because our restaurant is not huge.

100
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.690
So by keeping the six foot distance, we are open at 50% capacity when,

101
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.890
when we're very like full and happy because of the distance.

102
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.050
Um,

103
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.420
following all the protests for George Floyd and whatnot,

104
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.770
where social distance was totally relevant.

105
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.420
My business partner made a comment or personal Facebook saying, well,

106
00:06:35.421 --> 00:06:39.680
I guess the social distancing is not enforced.

107
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.900
So the mayor and the chief of police went to a parade where nothing

108
00:06:44.901 --> 00:06:45.734
was enforced.

109
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.720
And we started getting upset because he called it up parade instead of a

110
00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:54.830
March, which is basically, I don't know, just a technicality.

111
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:59.060
That didn't mean anything. He could have used another soccer game,

112
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.110
anything just to prove that the government is not helping us with regulations.

113
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.080
Uh, but these malicious person was sending his comment to all these

114
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.290
activists and all those people that are ready.

115
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.350
Don't but only in your racist when you're not.

116
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.960
So we started getting these, I guess, bombard, uh,

117
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.030
mints and ugly, you know, even death threats and, um,

118
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:31.910
people requesting that he would give an apology for being a racist,

119
00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:32.930
but he's like, no,

120
00:07:32.931 --> 00:07:36.590
I'm not going to give an apology because I'm not a racist again. Uh,

121
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.070
black friends of ours getting threats or being our friends.

122
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:45.140
These really truly became crazy way more than the

123
00:07:45.141 --> 00:07:48.140
COVID-19 would have ever heard those.

124
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:53.150
It was this action of malicious people just pointing the finger and saying

125
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.930
that my business partner is so racist that he goes to like blacks,

126
00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.710
that he doesn't like Mexicans when we are all Mexican in the restaurant,

127
00:08:00.711 --> 00:08:01.544
except for him.

128
00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:06.920
And just calling him overly names like white supremacist cookbooks plan

129
00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:10.760
member, when all he did was use the word parade,

130
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.530
which was a word, uh,

131
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.310
Reverend Lawson referred to in the event.

132
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:21.170
It is a Reverend that Lloyd's family chose to speak. And he called it.

133
00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.220
<v 1>Well, did he? He called it a parade. So actually,</v>

134
00:08:24.221 --> 00:08:27.010
so I'm glad you transitioned into that because, you know, we got,

135
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.590
we got hundreds of people that wanted to do small business. We can,

136
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.160
and obviously lots of restaurant tours that did some interesting things,

137
00:08:33.161 --> 00:08:35.050
but I thought this part of your story,

138
00:08:35.051 --> 00:08:39.220
when I read this is the next level of all of this that you guys,

139
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:42.190
you survive through, COVID you do what you have to do.

140
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:47.020
And then your business partner makes a completely, uh,

141
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.130
absolutely fine statement. We can all debate the word parade or not.

142
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:51.941
Even though, as you're saying,

143
00:08:51.941 --> 00:08:54.970
the Reverend at the funeral actually said the word parade, but putting that,

144
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.800
but now you're under a different type of attack and literally thousands of

145
00:08:58.801 --> 00:09:02.550
messages. And I saw some of them and, and death threats and,

146
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.910
and the rest of it in many ways, I think you just sort of alluded to this.

147
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:10.830
Do you view this as more of a danger as a small business person then than the

148
00:09:10.831 --> 00:09:11.664
other stuff?

149
00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:16.400
<v 0>Definitely. Definitely. Because this is an accusation that people throw at you,</v>

150
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:21.770
and then it's your responsibility to issue an apology for something

151
00:09:21.771 --> 00:09:26.090
you you've never even encountered in your life. And then to defend yourself.

152
00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.960
And even we got a lot of messages saying, well,

153
00:09:29.961 --> 00:09:33.890
now you should donate money to any of the black lives matter causes.

154
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:39.080
And that to me is it's extortion because we're in no position to donating

155
00:09:39.081 --> 00:09:40.160
anything, to anyone,

156
00:09:40.161 --> 00:09:43.640
but our employees and just to survive and to keep the business running.

157
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.630
But now we have all these special really weird interests,

158
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:52.880
bogging us to try to make us donate to specific causes that

159
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:57.410
we don't, we didn't even know existed because as again, in our minds,

160
00:09:57.411 --> 00:10:01.760
we've never been someone that could be accused of being a racist or,

161
00:10:01.761 --> 00:10:04.670
or a discriminator in any way or manner.

162
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.730
So it is just frustrating.

163
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.960
It's frustrating to see how many people stand behind our people like that,

164
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:17.180
that just use their keyboard as their weapon. They're in other States,

165
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.740
they're not even people from Houston,

166
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.220
they're people from Atlanta and people from California,

167
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:26.090
people from Detroit and from whatever places that have never,

168
00:10:26.091 --> 00:10:27.530
probably even been in Texas.

169
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:32.690
And they they're jump in and accuse us of being racist when we

170
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:34.003
were not.

171
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.940
<v 1>You and your business partner are standing up for it. And I promise you,</v>

172
00:10:37.941 --> 00:10:40.490
you know, I was supposed to be on a book tour and had to stop in Houston.

173
00:10:40.491 --> 00:10:44.120
So when we reschedule it, I will definitely have dinner with you guys.

174
00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.100
And now just to close out,

175
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:51.230
if I'm going to the restaurant in Houston, what am I having for dinner?

176
00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.840
Plan me the perfect meal. Tell me the perfect meal.

177
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.610
Now I know there's going to be a margarita there,

178
00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.130
but give me what's the perfect meal that I would.

179
00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.340
<v 0>You're going to start with a fresh margarita.</v>

180
00:11:01.341 --> 00:11:04.340
All our ingredients are fresh every single day. We don't freeze anything.

181
00:11:04.341 --> 00:11:06.470
So every whatever you have is going to be amazing,

182
00:11:06.471 --> 00:11:10.820
but I would definitely make you try it. Greece people take the tacos,

183
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:14.360
which come in a very spicy salad side that is very kind to make,

184
00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.670
even though it looks simple, you'll attest to the flavor.

185
00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:21.920
You'll probably have the pork and the Lord with Molly, our black or green.

186
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.230
Molly's my favorite. It's my grandma's recipe.

187
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:26.930
And I think that's besides the best salary.

188
00:11:26.931 --> 00:11:28.670
That's my favorite thing in the menu.

189
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:34.220
You probably will try a few sites like the shape porn or the

190
00:11:34.221 --> 00:11:37.010
corn duress. And then at the cert,

191
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:41.610
we have many different desserts and I would recommend this in colleges because

192
00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.553
it, why.

193
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.930
<v 1>I've never heard of Cinco. I know there was trace.</v>

194
00:11:47.931 --> 00:11:49.850
I did not know that was even possible.

195
00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.250
<v 0>You will fall in love. It's delicious. Wow. Two extra.</v>

196
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.040
<v 1>Late shades. Okay. All right. Well, Anna, thank you so much.</v>

197
00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:59.620
It's cuchara restaurant in Houston, Texas.

198
00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:02.470
I wish you guys a lot of luck and don't worry.

199
00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:06.490
I promise you if I know one thing you will survive the mob and you guys will

200
00:12:06.491 --> 00:12:08.830
come out better on the other side. Thank you so much.

201
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:12.240
