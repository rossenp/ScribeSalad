00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.960
<v 0>You know, they, they,</v>

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.900
they don't seem to fact check Joe Biden in Pennsylvania yesterday,

3
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.530
or the day before when he says I'm not against fracking. I'm like, well,

4
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.690
here's you on that same debate stage,

5
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.510
Joe saying that you'd eliminate fossil fuels that you said no new frack.

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.600
And here's you talking to another woman saying we're going to eliminate it all.

7
00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:18.000
I mean, there's 50 clips of him saying exactly the opposite,

8
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:20.970
but because fracking is an important issue in Pennsylvania,

9
00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:21.930
that is a swing state.

10
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.060
The media will literally run with the lie there where it's more of a

11
00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:27.960
sensitive issue.

12
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.070
They'll run with exactly the opposite and pretend as though both of them are

13
00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:34.710
true, just depending on who they're selling to. You know,

14
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.990
they're not fact checking. This is an egregious lie.

15
00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:39.960
There's tape all over the place. Not one fact check called him out on it.

16
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.870
Not one social media site took him down for dishonesty.

17
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.600
They let him run the clip as though it's true.

18
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.680
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

19
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.160
<v 2>Here for a minute because we're you guys, when I say you guys,</v>

20
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.700
the Trump organization, the campaign, your dad,

21
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.800
what was the feeling when,

22
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.640
when it came out that it was Kamala because on one hand,

23
00:01:07.641 --> 00:01:12.620
I think she's probably not as full say communist

24
00:01:12.621 --> 00:01:16.160
Marxist, whatever that Bernie thing is. But as you just pointed out,

25
00:01:16.161 --> 00:01:20.210
her voting record is pretty far left and she's an

26
00:01:20.211 --> 00:01:23.810
authoritarian. You know, she, she did that line,

27
00:01:23.811 --> 00:01:27.530
that line that I keep bringing up in the debate where they asked Biden,

28
00:01:27.531 --> 00:01:30.350
you know, will you do an executive action on guns? And he said, well,

29
00:01:30.351 --> 00:01:32.630
anything I would do would have to be constitutional,

30
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.040
which of course is the right answer.

31
00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:36.140
And she looked at him and laughed in his face.

32
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.990
And now this is the person who is now his VP.

33
00:01:38.991 --> 00:01:40.730
How did you guys feel about the choice?

34
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.480
<v 0>You know, I, I lived with, I sort of thought, I think it's a great thing, right?</v>

35
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.100
Cause you, you know where her record is. I mean,

36
00:01:46.101 --> 00:01:48.320
she's literally left of Bernie in voting records.

37
00:01:48.321 --> 00:01:51.050
She doesn't care about those sorts of things, as you've said, it's uh,

38
00:01:51.051 --> 00:01:54.440
so she's also so disingenuous. She's just, you know,

39
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.210
you see that she's a phony.

40
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.820
And so it's just been pure ambition for her whole life. And you know, that's,

41
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.680
that's not a terrible trait,

42
00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:03.260
but it is when you basically sell out all of your principles to get there.

43
00:02:03.261 --> 00:02:05.600
So for us, I think it's actually a great choice,

44
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.280
but the media also agrees because the media also wanted her to be number one,

45
00:02:10.281 --> 00:02:12.890
that's who they were pushing for from moment. Number one,

46
00:02:12.891 --> 00:02:15.350
now she's terrible in this stage. She's not so warm.

47
00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:19.490
She's just a terrible candidate, really. But for us,

48
00:02:19.491 --> 00:02:23.000
I love it because everyone believes she's the one that's going to be in charge.

49
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.630
Uh, you know, it's sort of, you know, Joe Biden picking her after she,

50
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.000
now I got fact checked for this. They told me that I was,

51
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.380
they threw me off Instagram for this one because I said she called him a racist.

52
00:02:33.381 --> 00:02:35.990
And she said to believe his sexual assault accusers. Cause again,

53
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.330
remember when someone accused of Joe Biden,

54
00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:40.250
even though there's corroborating evidence much more.

55
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:43.700
So that doesn't count only those who accused Trump of something with much,

56
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.420
with no evidence with no corroboration, with all nonsense, you know,

57
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.690
that's to be believed. But when it happens to Joe Biden from a Senate staffer,

58
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.860
no, no, no nothing to see here.

59
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.720
But she did those things and you saw her absolutely demolish him on the debate

60
00:02:56.721 --> 00:02:59.000
stage as it related to his racial decision and his,

61
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.900
then I get into that in the book a lot, but I said what?

62
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.530
She called him a racist. And she said to believe his sexual assault accusers.

63
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.260
So of course it gets fact-checked well, she didn't call him a racist,

64
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:11.620
but what do you mean? They go, well, she didn't say the words racist. I go.

65
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.220
Yeah. But she went on a five minute diatribe about how he supported busing,

66
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:17.710
how he partied with segregationist, how he did. I mean,

67
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.390
she didn't literally everything,

68
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:23.500
but no reasonable person in the world would assume that she meant anything other

69
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:25.120
than that. Yeah. I think Joe, Biden's a racist,

70
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:28.120
but they can fact check you as false. Uh, you know, they, they,

71
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.570
they don't seem to fact check Joe Biden in Pennsylvania yesterday or the day

72
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:34.690
before when he says I'm not against fracking. I'm like, well,

73
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.350
here's you on that same debate stage Joe saying that you'd eliminate fossil

74
00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:39.760
fuels that you said no new fracking,

75
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.790
here's you talking to another woman saying we're going to eliminate it all.

76
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.190
I mean, there's 50 clips of him saying exactly the opposite,

77
00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:48.160
but because fracking is an important issue in Pennsylvania,

78
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:49.090
that is a swing state.

79
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.220
The media will literally run with the lie there where it's more of a

80
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:55.120
sensitive issue.

81
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.260
They'll run with exactly the opposite and pretend as though both of them are

82
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:02.860
true, just depending on who they're selling to. They're not fact checking.

83
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:05.380
This is an egregious lie. There's tape all over the place.

84
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.120
Not one fact check called them out on it.

85
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.060
Not one social media site took him down for dishonesty.

86
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.110
They let him run the clip as though it's true. It's on his platform.

87
00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:17.710
Just go look at his website. So again, part of the whole thing,

88
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.220
that's liberal privilege. You can have the best of all worlds.

89
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.100
It doesn't matter what the truth is. It doesn't matter.

90
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:26.560
We are going to sell to the American public,

91
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:29.890
whatever it is that they want to hear to be able to effectuate the change that

92
00:04:29.891 --> 00:04:33.100
they want with just to put Joe Biden in office or whoever his puppet masters

93
00:04:33.101 --> 00:04:33.934
really are.

94
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.940
<v 2>So is the best example of that.</v>

95
00:04:35.941 --> 00:04:39.390
The exact video that Biden launched his campaign with,

96
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.580
which was the Charlottesville video.

97
00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:44.970
And he didn't have basically saying your dad is supporting white supremacists

98
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.210
when, of course, and no matter how many times we talk about this,

99
00:04:48.211 --> 00:04:52.770
it never makes it to mainstream media. The sentence before your dad said,

100
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.840
find people on both sides. And of course what he meant was of the statue debate,

101
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.130
completely condemned the KKK and the white supremacists and the neo-Nazis inner

102
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.920
though. But the media ran cover for Biden on that.

103
00:05:04.921 --> 00:05:08.880
So in Biden's mind or whatever's left of it, he was just like, all right, well,

104
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:09.630
I can just keep going.

105
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.560
<v 0>Why not? Why not run away that? I mean, they'll do whatever it takes to win.</v>

106
00:05:13.561 --> 00:05:16.110
It's no problem. Right? That's, that's what they're going to do by the way,

107
00:05:16.111 --> 00:05:20.040
they brought that up at the DNC multiple times as though literally you're right,

108
00:05:20.041 --> 00:05:21.630
the first sentence led up to it.

109
00:05:21.631 --> 00:05:24.450
So it was clear before it wasn't like he made a mistake and recovered.

110
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.310
It was very clear to begin with.

111
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.610
They play one force of the clip and then they forget about the second sentence,

112
00:05:29.611 --> 00:05:32.930
which was, and of course I'm condemning the white supremacists and the ne the,

113
00:05:32.931 --> 00:05:35.460
the crazy people that were there because it wasn't all that,

114
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.950
but they run with it as though it's the gospel. I mean,

115
00:05:37.951 --> 00:05:39.090
it's the same thing in the media.

116
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.060
They're still running Dave with Russia collusion.

117
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.200
There's still pretending like that's a real thing. Notice how there,

118
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.010
no one has any interest in like looking into comi and the FBI and Obama and

119
00:05:50.011 --> 00:05:52.110
Biden himself unmasking us.

120
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.490
It's the first time we've had a non peaceful transition of power, a great,

121
00:05:56.491 --> 00:06:01.130
great, great American tradition for 240 something years, nothing to see here,

122
00:06:01.131 --> 00:06:01.610
folks.

123
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.880
Now it was a big deal for three years when they thought it worked the other way,

124
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.820
when it worked against Trump, when, when they could do that, I mean,

125
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:10.850
you see the testimony of these clowns. I mean, under oath,

126
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.020
they'd say X on CNN later that day, they say exactly the opposite because no,

127
00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:16.130
one's going to hold them accountable.

128
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.040
They know it's not true because they're literally under oath saying the

129
00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:22.010
opposite, but guess what? We get to CNN job. How about, you know,

130
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.880
the comi is in the, McCabe's something, these guys lied to Congress that, well,

131
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:28.010
you know, it's really bad. You said a lot of Congress, but nothing to see here,

132
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.480
I'd be in jail. If I lied to Congress,

133
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.350
they get paid big bucks to then be a CNN contributor. I mean,

134
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:35.510
they're rewarded for treason.

135
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.630
They're awarded for lying to the country and to the American people.

136
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.850
That's sort of what we're up against. And again,

137
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.660
that's why I took it upon myself to do this book when I had no intention to do

138
00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:46.940
it because I've been a part of it. I've, you know,

139
00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:48.470
if you didn't believe in the deep state,

140
00:06:48.471 --> 00:06:53.150
if you didn't believe in sort of these big government things prior to 2016, I,

141
00:06:53.151 --> 00:06:55.370
you know, I get it. If you don't. Now,

142
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.950
if you think that these people are truly just trying to represent you,

143
00:06:57.951 --> 00:07:01.130
and they're not just taking care of themselves, you're out of your mind.

144
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:02.660
Look at what my father has tried to do. You know,

145
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.100
pulling troops out of Afghanistan,

146
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.980
ending these never ending Wars that our own generals can't even tell us why

147
00:07:06.981 --> 00:07:10.640
we're there anymore. You know, they, they start leaking opposition research.

148
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.230
Trump is getting soft on Russia. What,

149
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.540
there's more sanctions on Russia than any,

150
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.270
than any administration in American history,

151
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.000
but they do that because they want to stay in endless Wars because they don't

152
00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:23.930
care about sending your nice kids from middle America to go lose life and limb

153
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.900
abroad so they can keep the military industrial complex going.

154
00:07:26.901 --> 00:07:29.180
And that's not just Democrats, that they're a big part of it,

155
00:07:29.181 --> 00:07:32.570
but it's also the neo-cons and sort of the never Trump Republicans that hate

156
00:07:32.571 --> 00:07:33.890
that he's getting out. You know, why?

157
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.250
Because they want to be on the board of Raytheon for $500,000 a year.

158
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.410
They'll do whatever it takes. They'll get their board seat.

159
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.360
They'll do that element of their friends, get rich,

160
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.510
sending our kids to die for something that we don't even know why we're there.
